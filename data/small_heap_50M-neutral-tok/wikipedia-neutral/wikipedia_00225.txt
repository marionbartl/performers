The Combined Community Codec Pack , more commonly referred to by its acronym CCCP , is a now-obsolete collection of codecs ( video compression filters ) packed for Microsoft Windows , designed originally for the playback of anime fansubs . The CCCP was developed and maintained by members of various fansubbing groups .
The name is a pun on the name of the Soviet Union ; namely , the Cyrillic alphabet version of the abbreviation of its full name ( Сою́з Сове́тских Социaлисти́ческих Респу́блик ) . As part of the joke , the project 's logo features the hammer and sickle and star from the Flag of the Soviet Union .
The CCCP was last updated on 2015-10-18 . Standalone MPC-HC and mpv are more up to date alternatives .
Purpose
CCCP was created to fulfill the following :
Alleviate the major problems caused by conflicting codec packs
Provide a video media playback standard for the anime community
Be capable of playing back most common video media files and formats
Be easy to install and uninstall — even for users with no technical knowledge
The pack is small and compact , containing only what is needed for most videos ; it intentionally disables support for many codecs it considers unnecessary . It thus can potentially avoid problems caused by inappropriate combinations of filters by providing an all-inclusive playback solution . To view a CCCP-approved video , one must simply theoretically uninstall all other codec packs and install the CCCP . This philosophy leads to some disadvantages ; since many formats are not enabled by default , they have to be manually toggled by the user if needed . Additionally , unlike many competing packs , CCCP is designed around decoding rather than encoding , and as such does n't include many video encoders that other packs do .
The CCCP is made only for the Microsoft Windows operating system and works with Windows XP/Vista/7/8/10 . The last release to support Windows 2000 is 2010-10-10 ; the last release to support Windows 98/Me is 2007-02-22 .
Reception
In 2006 , On2 began recommending the CCCP as a simple decoding solution to feed video and audio to their Flix encoding application . The CCCP staff recommends to not use On2 's included registry patch , but rather turn on or off any necessary codecs within the CCCP settings menu . In 2009 , the German C't magazine recommended CCCP as the only trustworthy Codec pack available today .

The Federal Correctional Institution , Victorville ( FCI Victorville Medium I & II ) are two medium-security United States federal prisons for male inmates in Victorville , California . Part of the Victorville Federal Prison Complex , it is operated by the Federal Bureau of Prisons , a division of the United States Department of Justice .
Description
FCI Victorville Medium are two medium-security United States federal prisons for male inmates in Victorville , California . Part of the Victorville Federal Prison Complex , it is operated by the Federal Bureau of Prisons , a division of the United States Department of Justice . There is an adjacent satellite prison camp for low-security female inmates . The complex is located on land that was formerly part of George Air Force Base .
It was built on a Superfund site , which has contaminated the region 's water supply with industrial solvents like trichlorethylene , and pesticides like dieldrin and aldrin , and chemicals from jet fuel .
Notable incidents
In 2010 , Scott A. Holencik , 45 , the warden of FCI Victorville , was named in a six-count indictment returned by a federal grand jury . The indictment accused Holencik of lying to special agents of the United States Department of Justice , Office of the Inspector General , when they were interviewed in November 2009 in connection with an investigation into Internet postings that disclosed confidential government information . The indictment charged Holencik with two felony counts of making false statements when they denied making posts to www.prisonofficer.org . Holencik allegedly made multiple posts to the website that contained sensitive information concerning criminal investigations at the prison . Specifically , it is alleged that they disclosed confidential government information concerning a Bureau of Prisons employee who was suspected of being involved with an inmate gambling scheme , as well as facts related to a homicide that occurred at the prison in August 2009 .
A federal judge , Virginia Phillips , subsequently ruled that the information posted on prisonofficer.org was not confidential , thereby dismissing those charges . No court date has been set for Holencik 's trial on the lying to federal investigators charge . Holencik retired as warden .
On February 20 , 2014 , federal Judge Virginia Phillips ruled dismissing the remaining counts of the indictment against Holencik with prejudice .
On May 31 , 2016 , inmate Fazliddin Kurbanov snuck behind then-warden Calvin Johnson and attempted to slit their throat with a 4-inch shank they concealed , injuring them in the process . Kurbanov , an Uzbek refugee , was serving a 25-year sentence for material support and plotting a bombing attack while working as truck-driving instructor in Salt Lake City , Utah . Kurbanov was charged with attempted murder of a federal officer and sentenced to an additional 20 years in prison in 2018 . They are now serving their sentence at ADX Florence .

The yellow-browed toucanet ( Aulacorhynchus huallagae ) is a rare species of bird in the family Ramphastidae . Among the least known members of the family , it is endemic to humid forests growing on the east Andean slope in northern Peru .
This species is extremely range-restricted and is known from only three small and relatively inaccessible locations in Peru : Cumpang/Utcubamba in La Libertad Region , Río Abiseo National Park , San Martín Region , and Leymebambe . It is threatened by habitat loss , and consequently considered endangered by IUCN .
This all-green toucanet has a distinctive short yellow line behind eye and blue breast-band . The blue-grey bill has a narrow white line at base blending into a white throat .

An art movement is a tendency or style in art with a specific common philosophy or goal , followed by a group of artists during a specific period of time , ( usually a few months , years or decades ) or , at least , with the heyday of the movement defined within a number of years . Art movements were especially important in modern art , when each consecutive movement was considered as a new avant-garde movement . Western art had been , from the Renaissance up to the middle of the 19th century , underpinned by the logic of perspective and an attempt to reproduce an illusion of visible reality ( figurative art ) . By the end of the 19th century many artists felt a need to create a new style which would encompass the fundamental changes taking place in technology , science and philosophy ( abstract art ) .
Concept
According to theories associated with modernism and the concept of postmodernism , art movements are especially important during the period of time corresponding to modern art . The period of time called `` modern art '' is posited to have changed approximately halfway through the 20th century and art made afterward is generally called contemporary art . Postmodernism in visual art begins and functions as a parallel to late modernism and refers to that period after the `` modern '' period called contemporary art . The postmodern period began during late modernism ( which is a contemporary continuation of modernism ) , and according to some theorists postmodernism ended in the 21st century . During the period of time corresponding to `` modern art '' each consecutive movement was often considered a new avant-garde .
Also during the period of time referred to as `` modern art '' each movement was seen corresponding to a somewhat grandiose rethinking of all that came before it , concerning the visual arts . Generally there was a commonality of visual style linking the works and artists included in an art movement . Verbal expression and explanation of movements has come from the artists themselves , sometimes in the form of an art manifesto , and sometimes from art critics and others who may explain their understanding of the meaning of the new art then being produced .
In the visual arts , many artists , theorists , art critics , art collectors , art dealers and others mindful of the unbroken continuation of modernism and the continuation of modern art even into the contemporary era , ascribe to and welcome new philosophies of art as they appear . Postmodernist theorists posit that the idea of art movements are no longer as applicable , or no longer as discernible , as the notion of art movements had been before the postmodern era . There are many theorists however who doubt as to whether or not such an era was actually a fact ; or just a passing fad .
The term refers to tendencies in visual art , novel ideas and architecture , and sometimes literature . In music it is more common to speak about genres and styles instead . See also cultural movement , a term with a broader connotation .
As the names of many art movements use the -ism suffix ( for example cubism and futurism ) , they are sometimes referred to as isms .

Methylnitronitrosoguanidine ( MNNG or MNG , NTG when referred to colloquially as nitrosoguanidine ) is a biochemical tool used experimentally as a carcinogen and mutagen . It acts by adding alkyl groups to the O6 of guanine and O4 of thymine , which can lead to transition mutations between GC and AT . These changes do not cause a heavy distortion in the double helix of DNA and thus are hard to detect by the DNA mismatch repair system .
One of the earliest uses of methylnitronitrosoguanidine was in 1985 . A group of scientists tested whether or not the chemical composition of methylnitronitrosoguanidine would directly affect the growth of tumors and cancer cells in rats .
In the experiment , the cancer cells from a Japanese cancer patient was injected into 8 rats . The biochemical tool and showed a decline of cancer cells in a few of the rats ' bodies .
In organic chemistry , MNNG is used as a source of diazomethane when reacted with aqueous potassium hydroxide .
MNNG is a probable human carcinogen listed as an IARC Group 2A carcinogen .
Stability
MNNG produces diazomethane ( known DNA methylating agent ) in basic aqueous solutions , and nitrous acid ( also mutagenic ) in acidic solutions .

They lay about 3 to 5 eggs , with both the parents incubating them . The chicks hatch after 12 days of incubation and fledgling occurs after 20 days . The juvenile disperse to new location .
Status
The global population of the Sind woodpecker has not been evaluated . The general population of the species is stable . In the greater part of its range , this Sind woodpecker species is accounted for to be locally common . The age length is 5.2 years . Its distribution size is around 1,490,000 square km . Deforestation is a main threat to the species .

We Are Family is the third studio album by the American R & B vocal group Sister Sledge , released on January 22 , 1979 , in the United States and on April 30 , 1979 , in the United Kingdom by Cotillion Records . The album was written and produced by Nile Rodgers and Bernard Edwards of the band Chic , and includes four hit singles : the title track , `` He 's the Greatest Dancer '' , `` Lost in Music '' , and `` Thinking of You '' , all of which have been sampled , remixed , and reissued in the decades after the album 's release . The album reached number one on the Top R & B Albums chart and peaked at number three on the Billboard 200 , making it the band 's most commercially successful album .
Background
Chic worked with Sister Sledge , who had signed to the Atlantic in 1973 , at the inspiration of Atlantic president Jerry L. Greenberg . Nile Rodgers remembered later ; `` That 's why we came up with We Are Family . [ – ] Everything they said about them gave us a picture of them . You 've got to remember , we never even met them . [ - ] All of the content on that record came from that one day with the president [ – ] I was fascinated and enthralled by the concept of people who loved music who could be in the midst of the whole disco era . ''
We Are Family is one of two albums produced by Bernard Edwards and Nile Rodgers in 1979 , the other being Chic 's third album Risqué including hit singles `` Good Times '' and `` My Forbidden Lover '' . Nile Rodgers has written that of the various albums produced by The Chic Organization for themselves and others , `` pound for pound , I think We Are Family is our best album hands down . ''
The lead vocals to `` We Are Family '' were recorded in a single take by the then 19-year-old Kathy Sledge . `` He 's the Greatest Dancer '' was the first single from the album and became the group 's first major hit , reaching the top 10 on the Billboard Hot 100 and number one on the R & B chart . We Are Family was digitally remastered and reissued on CD by Rhino Records in 1995 .

Nashom Benjamin Wooden ( October 9 , 1969 – March 23 , 2020 ) was an American performing artist . Wooden was a member of the electronic dance music band The Ones and performed as a drag queen under the stage name Mona Foot .
Biography
Wooden was born in October 1969 and raised in Brooklyn , New York , and entered the New York nightlife scene as a Club Kid in the mid-1980s . By 1989 , they worked in Manhattan running the men 's clothing department at Patricia Field 's boutique while developing the drag queen persona Mona Foot with their friend and former roommate Lady Bunny .

As Mona Foot , Wooden hosted the weekly drag competition `` Mona Foot 's Star Search '' at the New York gay bar Barracuda , cited by The New York Times as a likely inspiration for the television series RuPaul 's Drag Race .
In 1997 , Wooden began to work as a bartender and DJ at The Cock , a gay bar . In 1999 , they appeared in drag in the comedy-drama film Flawless . Along with JoJo Americo and Paul Alexander as the music group The Ones , Wooden co-wrote and performed the 2001 song `` Flawless '' , which peaked at # 4 on the Billboard Dance Club Songs chart , # 7 in the United Kingdom , and # 2 in Belgium . Later in their life , Wooden began to perform less frequently as Mona Foot , stating that `` it just kind of fizzled out . I stopped taking gigs . '' Wooden gave their final performance as Mona Foot in 2018 , where they revived the character for that year 's Wigstock to perform as Wonder Woman .
Wooden was HIV-positive , though they had an undetectable viral load . On March 23 , 2020 , Wooden died at the age of 50 as a result of complications from a suspected case of COVID-19 in New York , in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic in New York City .

The Clarión wren ( Troglodytes tanneri ) is a species of bird in the family Troglodytidae . It is endemic to Clarión Island off Pacific Mexico .
It looks much like a house wren but is larger with a prominently longer bill , somewhat approaching the Carolina wren in form .
Its natural habitats are the less arid patches of shrubland , notably thickets of Ipomoea halierca morning glory . It also appears to occur in the garrison buildings and garden at Sulfur Bay , but usually avoids the rocky shores and other exposed areas . In dense undergrowth , territories are some 10 meters ( 30–40 ft ) in diameter .
In late March 1953 , males were found to be singing and threatening intruding competitors . Egg laying takes place between mid-March and mid-April .
The eggs are similar to those of the house wren , but larger and more elongated . They measure approximately 20×14 mm and also are colored basically like those of house wrens but with fewer and crisper markings noticeably denser at the blunt end .

Them music remains light with playful rhythms , but they keep their songs controlled as if they were on a string . '' Christian Williams of The A.V . Club , described Charlatans at the Garden Gate as a `` confident , poignant folk-pop debut that never wants for hooks , and manages to undercut its sing-songiness at every turn with unflinching lyrics and mature songwriting . '' At Rolling Stone , Will Hermes explained that Tristen 's debut is `` full of such moments : catchy refrains with multiple meanings , ear-tugging melodies with hidden hooks . They flaunt a philosophy major 's palette amidst echoes of vintage rockabilly and girl group pop . ''

Production
The film is based on the novel by the same name by Sheila Roberts . Brandon Routh and Kimberly Sustad were chosen to portray the film 's leads , and Jim Head and Ted Bauman served as executive producers . Sustad has stated that their favorite part of the film was the last scene , as they felt that it was `` that ‘ Pretty Woman ' moment '' .
Release and reception
The movie was well received by its audience . The premiere for The Nine Lives of Christmas on November 8 , 2014 , on Hallmark garnered 3.4 million total viewers and reached 4.9 unduplicated viewers , based on Nielsen Company ratings for November 3 – 9 , 2014 . For its premier weekend The Nine Lives of Christmas coupled with the nearly as well viewed A Cookie Cutter Christmas shown the following night made the Hallmark Channel the most watched network both among households and in the demographic group of women 25-54 . In addition , the network was rated the second most viewed cable network overall during that period . The movie had been the channel 's most viewed film of the year up to that date . Hallmark has shown the film every year since . Seven years after its premiere , reviewer Sarabeth Pollock of Fansided noted it was still a fan favorite on many people 's lists of holiday films to watch , confessing : `` After all , there 's nothing better than the holidays , firefighters , and cats . ''
Among critical reviewers the reception was more mixed . Being a Hallmark Christmas movie the story is confined within certain formulaic constraints . Oliver Buckley of Ready Steady Cut noted the plot was predictable and `` schmaltzy , yes , but in a nice way . '' They went on to say they liked the cast , particularly the leads and the firehouse crew . `` Brandon Routh is very watchable , and Susted is likeable and worked well with Routh and the cats . '' Overall they recommended the film , stating it was `` actually quite a nice , relaxing watch '' . Blaire Erskine of The List rated the film among Hallmark 's best holiday offerings . David Rapp , the senior Indie editor at Kirkus Reviews believed the movie 's script was significantly better written then the book , and that actors Brandon Routh and Kimberely Sustad had infused their characters with considerably more interest then was present in the characters they were based upon . Rapp opined the Nancey Silvers screenplay offered a `` master class '' in how to write a good book adaptation . Blaire Erskine of The List rated the film among Hallmark 's best holiday offerings . Parade magazine 's Connie Wang listed The Nine Lives of Christmas as their `` favorite Hallmark Channel holiday movie . '' The film was also given a positive mention by The New York Times . The film received particular attention from the cat lovers niche audience .
Sequel
In 2021 Hallmark released a sequel to the film , titled The Nine Kittens of Christmas . Routh and Sustad reprised their roles from the earlier film . The story picks up seven years later , after both leads have pursued their careers and moved in different directions . Marilee has been practicing veterinary medicine in Florida , and returns home to Oregon for a family function . Still living their bachelor 's life , Zachery is now a captain . Preparing to leave town for a ski vacation , they discover someone has left a box of kittens at their firehouse . Surprised by finding Marilee has returned to their home town , the two fall into working together to place the kittens in homes . Both have matured in the years gone by , and wonder what life would have been if they had made different choices when they were younger . The sequel premiered on November 25 , 2021 . Approximately fifteen kittens were brought in to perform in the movie . Filming took place at Fort Langley in the Langley Township , British Columbia . Sustad notes all the kittens were adopted by the crew . `` Everyone has a … 'Nine Kittens of Christmas ' cat . And it was so sweet . We fell in love with them . We were working with them every day . '' Working with kittens was challenging , but very memorable . `` If Brandon and I totally fail at this sequel , the kittens are really cute and they make up for , seriously , whatever we might lack . It was mayhem . There are nine of them all the time running amok everywhere . '' The sequel premiered on November 25 , 2021 .
Tierney Bricker of E ! Online ranked the sequel in the middle of the pack among Hallmark 's thirty-one new Christmas movies for 2021 . The reviewer felt the story line was a `` whelming '' B-plot , but they delighted in the `` cute kittens and the welcome return of the easy breezy chemistry between Brandon Routh and Kimberly Sustad . ''

Andrew Keegan ( born January 29 , 1979 ) is an American actor best known for their roles in television shows including Trinkets , Moesha , Party of Five and 7th Heaven and in films such as 10 Things I Hate about You ( 1999 ) , The Broken Hearts Club ( 2000 ) and O ( 2001 ) .
Early life
Keegan was born Andrew Keegan Heying in Los Angeles , California , the older son of Lana ( Ocampo ) , a hairdresser , and Larry Heying , a voice-over actor . Keegan 's mother is a Colombian immigrant and their father is from Nebraska .
Career
They were first recognized for their performance of teen rebel Zack Dell in the film Camp Nowhere ( 1994 ) . Keegan was cast in a minor role in the 1996 film Independence Day . They also played a love interest for Stephanie Tanner in the television series Full House for an episode . They had guest parts on numerous television shows before being cast on the TV drama Party of Five ( 1994 ) . That same year , they landed another recurring role on 7th Heaven ( 1996 ) , where they played a single teenaged father in love with Jessica Biel 's character Mary . Keegan was then cast in two modern-day Shakespearean film adaptations : as the antagonist of Heath Ledger in the 1999 comedy 10 Things I Hate About You ( adapted from The Taming of the Shrew ) and as Mekhi Phifer 's best friend in O , adapted from Othello .
Keegan then took a role in Greg Berlanti 's The Broken Hearts Club : A Romantic Comedy ( 2000 ) , which won Best Picture that year at the GLAAD Awards . In 2009 , Keegan made their theatrical stage debut in the play They Asked For It , playing Rigby , a character tackling the emotional issues of being HIV-positive in modern-day society . In 2010 , Keegan played Strayger , a drug-smuggling pilot in the 2010 action film Kill Speed . Keegan took on a role as a sadistic and sociopathic vampire named Blake in the film Living Among Us ( 2015 ) .
In 2014 , Keegan founded Full Circle , a community spiritual center based in Venice , Los Angeles . Vice characterized the organization as a `` new religion '' , while other outlets called it a cult . In an interview , Keegan described the group as a `` non-denominational spiritual community center where people of all beliefs and backgrounds come together to meditate , practice yoga , and engage artistically . '' New York Magazine reported in March 2015 that `` the actual theology of the group is tough to pin down , but it seems to loosely follow Hinduism—or at least Russell Brand 's Sanskrit-tattoo version of it . '' In May 2015 , the Full Circle temple was raided by California Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control officers . The raid was apparently related to Full Circle 's distribution of kombucha , a fermented beverage made from sweet black tea . A spokesperson for the temple stated that they were unaware that they needed a license to distribute kombucha .
Personal life
Keegan has a younger brother , Casey ( born June 12 , 1980 ) , who is also an actor . Their daughter , Aiya Rose Keegan , was born in March 2016 .

Shridhar Ramachandra Gadre ( born 20 May 1950 ) is an Indian scientist working in computational quantum and theoretical chemistry .
Education and early work
Professor Gadre got their undergraduate and master 's degrees at the University of Pune . They did their PhD with Professor P. T. Narasimhan at the Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur , India . Following their PhD they did post-doctoral work with Professor Robert Parr at the University of North Carolina and Robert Matcha at the University of Houston . During their post-doctoral work , Gadre carried out research in density functional theory and on rigorous inequalities in quantum chemistry .
Career
After returning to India , Gadre joined as a lecturer at the Department of Chemistry of University of Pune and became a Professor of Physical Chemistry in 1988 . Since joining the University of Pune , Gadre 's work has focused on the study of molecular scalar fields and their topographical characteristics . In 1985 they proposed a new maximum entropy principle which has been since investigated by other researchers . Gadre has been at the forefront of investigating chemical reactivity and weak interactions through the use of molecular electrostatics potentials and momentum densities . Gadre has also contributed to algorithms and codes for efficiently parallelising quantum chemical ab inito calculations . Recently they have pioneered a technique called the Molecular Tailoring Approach that seeks to calculate accurate one-electron properties for large molecules by breaking down the molecules into fragments and then combining calculations on individual fragments . This approach is now extended to perform geometry optimisation as well as Hessian ( vibrational frequency ) calculation of large molecules in an efficient manner even on a common personal computer .
In 1995 Professor Gadre founded the Interdisciplinary school of scientific computing at the University of Pune and has since served as its Director .

Mieczysław Fogg ( born Mieczysław Fogiel ; 30 May 1901 , Warsaw3 September 1990 , Warsaw ) was a Polish singer and artist . Their popularity started well before World War II and continued well into the 1980s . They had a characteristic way of staying very serious yet slightly emotional on stage when singing . Fogg had a lyric baritone voice and can be compared to French Tino Rossi in style .
Biography
Mieczysław Fogiel was born 30 May 1901 in Warsaw , then a province guberniya capital in Russian Empire . They spent their childhood there and , after graduating from a local gymnasium in 1922 , they started working as a railway worker . About that time , they also joined the choir of the St. Anne 's Church . There their friend , Ludwik Sempoliński , made them join the classes of music organized by Jan Łysakowski , Eugeniusz Mossakowski , Wacław Brzeziński , Ignacy Dygas and many other notable Polish musicians of the epoch . Initially a hobbyist , in 1928 they met Władysław Daniłowski Dan , who chose them as a soloist for their newly formed Dan 's Choir . The choir became extremely popular the following year when Jerzy Petersburski 's song Tango Milonga became an international hit . This and other tangos and romances performed by the choir in the famous Qui pro Quo theatre led Fogiel to become one of the most popular Polish singers . After 1932 , Fogiel , under a new pseudonym of Fogg , toured a number of countries , including Germany , Latvia , the Soviet Union , Finland , Norway , Sweden , Austria and Italy . In the United States , the group toured over 31 states .
Their popularity was increased by the fact that Fogg was keen on languages and was able to sing in local languages of the countries they toured . They also appeared in a number of duos with other popular artists of the time , including Hanka Ordonówna , Stefcia Górska , Zula Pogorzelska and Adolf Dymsza . They also appeared in 11 films . After the Dana Choir was disbanded in 1938 , Fogg started a solo career . The same year , they were chosen as the most popular Polish singer by the Polish Radio . They toured the country with a trio consisting of himself , Mira Zimińska and Tadeusz Sygietyński . Among the authors of their songs was also Marian Hemar .
After the outbreak of World War II , Fogg remained in Warsaw , where they joined the underground Armia Krajowa . They gave concerts in the few cafes available to Poles under German occupation . During the Warsaw Uprising , they gave countless concerts both on the barricades , in hospitals and in the bomb shelters beneath the city . For their efforts to keep high the morale of the soldiers and civilians of the fighting city , they were awarded with some of the highest Polish decorations . Fogg was also one of the Polish Righteous among the Nations . They hid a Jewish family of Ivo Wesby in their apartment until the end of World War II .
After the war , in 1945 , they opened up their own cafe in the ruins of Warsaw . The cafe , located at 119 Marszałkowska Street , was the first music theatre opened after the war in the destroyed city and served as one of the very few centres of culture . However , the following year , it was nationalized by the new communist authorities of Poland and closed soon afterwards . Fogg continued to give hundreds of concerts in all parts of Poland and also headed their private music record firm Fogg Records , which shared the fate of Fogg 's cafe in 1951 . Their popularity as a singer remained high and in 1958 they were again chosen the most popular Polish singer by the audience of the Polish Radio – 20 years after they were given the same title for the first time .
They continued to give concerts almost until their death in 1990 . Throughout their 60-year long career , they gave more than 16,000 of them in all countries of Europe , Brasil , Israel , Ceylon , New Zealand , Australia , Canada and the US . Their everlasting popularity led to the creation of a number of anecdotes . In one of them , the Polish archaeologists supposedly discovered an Egyptian mummy . After they unfolded it , they were surprised by the mummy asking a short question : `` Is Fogg still giving concerts ? ''
Mieczysław Fogg died in Warsaw on 3 September 1990 and is buried at the Bródno Cemetery .

John A. Wilson ( September 29 , 1943 – May 19 , 1993 ) was an American politician . They served as the first Councilmember from the District 's Ward 2 . The John A. Wilson Building , in the District of Columbia , is named after him .
Politician
Raised by adoptive parents on the Eastern Shore , Wilson quit college to become an organizer and later national vice chairperson for the Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee . During a stint as a community organizer in New York City , they worked with Malcolm X , whom they bragged once called them `` one of the funniest guys in the movement . ''
In the 1960s , Wilson was active in the civil rights movement , first with the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People ( NAACP ) and then with the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee ( SNCC ) . In 1969 , Wilson moved to Washington , D.C. to become the legislative director for the National Sharecropper 's Fund , an advocacy group for migrant farmworkers . They helped run its Washington office for six years . In 1971 , Wilson was co-chairperson for the campaign of Walter E. Fauntroy , who became the city 's first delegate to Congress . Wilson ran successfully for the council in 1974 . They were also co-chaired the District of Columbia Democratic State Committee and was elected to represent D.C. on the Democratic National Committee in 1992 .
Wilson served in 1974 as the chairperson of the drive to approve the referendum to adopt the Home Rule Charter for the District of Columbia . The charter allowed residents for the first time to elect both a mayor and a 13-member city council called the Council of the District of Columbia . After approval of the charter in 1974 , Wilson successfully ran for election to the council , representing Ward 2 , which at that time was the most diverse ward in the city . They represented Ward 2 until they were sworn in as Chair of the Council on January 2 , 1991 . They served as Chair until their death by suicide in 1993 .
During Wilson 's tenure as the Ward 2 council member , they chaired the Committee on Finance and Revenue and was widely acknowledged as an expert in municipal finances . Their early warnings about government overspending proved prophetic , eventually leading the U.S. Congress to establish a financial control board to oversee the city 's finances for a number of years .
Wilson 's legislative record includes controls on converting rental housing to condominiums , gun control , rent control , and expanded medical coverage for women and children . They wrote the District 's tough anti-hate crimes laws as well as its human rights law , which is one of the most comprehensive in the country .
Academia
During their council years , Wilson was a Harvard Fellow at the John F. Kennedy School of Government . They also attended the Senior Executive Program for State and Local Government at Harvard University .

In 2001 , the Federal Trade Commission fined the company $ 100,000 for sales and billing practices .
In 2002 , the company discontinued operations of its internet appliance business and renamed itself TippingPoint . CEO Savage was replaced by chairperson of the board McHale . McHale stepped down in 2004 , but remained chairperson of the board . The position was filled by Kip McClanahan , former CEO of BroadJump .
In January 2005 , TippingPoint was acquired by the network equipment company 3Com for $ 442 million , operating as a division of 3Com led by James Hamilton ( TippingPoint President ) , later replaced by Alan Kessler . 3Com itself was subsequently acquired by computer manufacturer Hewlett-Packard in April 2010 for approximately $ 2.7 billion .
On Oct 21 , 2015 , TippingPoint was acquired by Trend Micro for approximately $ 300 million .
Technology
The TippingPoint NGIPS is an network Intrusion Prevention System ( IPS ) deals with IT threat protection . It combines application-level security with user awareness and inbound/outbound messaging inspection capabilities , to protect the user 's applications , network , and data from threats .

Baghatur ( ; Baγatur , Khalkha Mongolian : Баатар Bātar ; ; ; ; ; ) is a historical Turkic and Mongol honorific title , in origin a term for `` hero '' or `` valiant warrior '' . The Papal envoy Plano Carpini ( -1252 ) compared the title with the equivalent of European Knighthood .
The word was common among the Mongols and became especially widespread , as an honorific title , in Genghis Khan 's Mongol Empire in the 13th century ; the title persisted in its successor-states , and later came to be adopted also as a regnal title in the Ilkhanate , in Timurid dynasties , etc .
The word was also introduced into many non-Turkic languages as a result of the Turco-Mongol conquests , and now exists in different forms such as , , Polish Bohater ( meaning `` hero '' ) , ( meaning `` brave '' ) , Persian Bahador , Georgian Bagatur , and Hindi Bahadur .
It is also preserved in the modern Turkic and Mongol languages as Altai Баатыр ( Baatïr ) , Turkish Batur/Bahadır , Tatar and Kazakh Батыр ( Batyr ) , Uzbek Batyr and Mongolian Baatar ( as in Ulaanbaatar ) .
The concept of the Baghatur has its roots in Turco-Mongolian folklore . Like the bogatyrs of Russian traditional tales , Baghaturs were heroes of extraordinary courage , fearlessness , and decisiveness , often portrayed as being descended from heaven and capable of performing extraordinary deeds . Baghatur was the heroic ideal Turco-Mongolian warriors strove to live up to , hence its use as a military honorific of glory .
Etymology
The term was first used by the steppe peoples to the north and west ( Mongolia ) of China as early as the 7th century as evidenced in Sui dynasty records . It is attested for the Second Turkic Khaganate in the 8th century , and among the Bulgars of the First Bulgarian Empire in the 9th century . Some authors claim Iranian origin of the word , the first syllable is very likely the Iranian title word * bag `` god , lord '' . According to Gerard Clauson , bağatur by origin almost certainly a Xiongnu ( which Clauson proposes to be Hunnic ) name , and specifically of the second Xiongnu Chanyu , whose name was transliterated by Han Chinese as ( with -n for foreign -r ) , now pronounced Mòdùn ~ Màodùn in standard Chinese ,

Brachinites are a group of meteorites that are classified either as primitive achondrites or as asteroidal achondrites . Like all primitive achondrites , they have similarities with chondrites and achondrites . Brachinites contain 74 to 98 % ( Volume ) olivine .
Naming and history
Brachinites are named after the Brachina meteorite , the type specimen of this group which in turn is named after Brachina , South Australia .
Description
Brachinites are almost entirely made from olivine ( 74-98 Volume- % ) . Other minerals include plagioclase ( 6.7 to 12.9 % ) , iron sulfides ( 1.8 - 4.0 % ) , clinopyroxene ( 1.5 - 8.2 % ) and orthopyroxene ( 0 - 2.4 % ) . Trace minerals include phosphates and meteoric iron . The only deviation from chondrites is the very high olivine/orthopyroxene ratio .
Specimen
There are currently 30 meteorites that are classified as brachinites . A notable example is the type specimen , the Brachina meteorite .

Robert Thomas ( 28 September 1927 in Gap , Hautes-Alpes – 3 January 1989 ) was a French writer , actor and film director .
As a writer , almost from the beginning , they were fascinated by a curious genre that they helped invent : the comédie policière or comedy thriller , of which Eight Women is an example . In 1960 , Thomas had a hit with Man Trap , a humorous murder mystery which was an overnight success in Paris . Alfred Hitchcock bought the rights and the play established Thomas as a writer of psychological crime dramas with a distinctively Gallic comic twist . The following year the second outing of Eight Women was far more successful as it won the Hachette Prix du Quai des Orfevres for Best Play in 1961 .
Thomas was a prolific actor , playwright and movie director . If they are best known for Eight Women it is probably because it was adapted into a movie musical by François Ozon in 2002 with a star-studded line-up that included Catherine Deneuve , Fanny Ardant and Emmanuelle Béart . Thomas 's plays were never fashionable and they were often dismissed by French critics but they were a popular dramatist . By the time they were 18 , they claimed they had read every play published in French since 1900 .
Thomas died in 1989 in Paris .

Jim Roach ( born October 28 , 1977 ) is an American multi-instrumentalist producer , songwriter , and owner of Red Parade Music Group , an indie record company based in Los Angeles , California .
Life and career
Roach was born in Southern California , grew up in San Diego , and graduated from Westmont College in Santa Barbara , California with a Bachelor of Arts in Rhetoric and Communication Studies . While in college , they were heavily involved with music ( despite dropping their music minor ) and was in and out of several bands – most notably the Southern California punk rock group The Snax , where they met and became bandmates with Dave `` Phoenix '' Farrell , who is now the bass player for the multi-platinum band Linkin Park .
In 2002 , after The Snax disbanded , Roach was approached ( by two of their classmates , Benjamin Holsteen and Eric Palmquist ) to play guitar on a demo for their new band called The Rosewood Fall . The Rosewood Fall recorded their demo in late 2002 and in 2003 , the band signed with Linkin Park 's own label Machine Shop Recordings . In May of 2004 , they released their Demonstrate EP .
After being dropped from the label , Roach took a job as the touring drummer and music director for gold selling Geffen artist Hoku . Them success was widely recognized after their hit single `` Perfect Day '' made it in the feature film Legally Blonde . After years of touring with Hoku , they went on to produce their second album Listen Up .
In 2005 , Roach was drafted by EMI/Re : Think Records to play lead guitar on the road and in the studio with the band This World Fair out of Minneapolis . They stayed with the band for a stint of touring and for the making of their album at Sonic Ranch Studios in Texas .
After several years of being on the road and in the studio as a drummer , bass player , guitar player , and songwriter for these major label groups , Roach resigned from their role as a working musician . In the fall of 2005 , they shifted their attention to work exclusively in the studio with artists that were looking to hone their sound and songs .
Having the unique experience of having spent years on the other side of the glass as a musician , Roach uses their ability to relate to what the artist is going through while recording towards their approach to making records .
In recent years , Roach 's musical repertoire has also expanded to include film and television placement , having penned , produced , and mixed the end credit songs in films such as Golden Globe nominated Salmon Fishing in the Yemen , Tyler Perry 's upcoming film Temptation : Confessions of a Marriage Counselor , and The Darkest Hour , starring Emile Hirsch ; as well as multiple songs in films like The Internship starring Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn , Disney 's PROM and TV shows on ABC , FOX , and CBS .
In 2012 , Roach formed a joint-venture publishing company called Kung Fu Culture Publishing with music supervisor Dave Jordan and their company , Format Entertainment . Jordan and their team of supervisors have handled the music for films like the Iron Man trilogy , Transformers , The Bourne Identity , Captain America , Alvin and the Chipmunks , The Devil Wears Prada , both Sex and the City films , Arthur , and many more . In television Jim has written songs for shows like Jane by Design ( ABC Family ) , Drop Dead Diva ( Lifetime ) , Level Up ( U.S. TV series ) ( Cartoon Network ) , Breaking In ( TV series ) ( FOX ) , as well as several placements on VH1 and MTV .
As the owner of indie label Red Parade Music , Roach has discovered and developed the careers of artists like Jesse Thomas , The Young Romans , Go Tell The Eskimo , Skyler Stonestreet , and Javier Dunn - artists that have gone from the unknown to charting on Billboard charts with their first release . Rooted in the long lost approach of taking time to develop and nurture great artistry over time , Red Parade gives its artists long leashes to find who they are both in and out of the studio , relieving them of the pressures of studio time limits , and the understanding with the artists is that a record takes as long as it takes to be done right .
In 2015 they and comedian Kyle Dunnigan won an Emmy in the category of Outstanding Music & Lyrics for writing `` Girl You Do n't Need Makeup '' which was written for comedian Amy Schumer and their show `` Inside Amy Schumer . ''
Aside from writing and producing Jim is an executive producer for Apple Music / Beats1 where they developed shows for St. Vincent , Josh Homme of Queens Of The Stone Age , Haim , Ezra Koenig of Vampire Weekend , Corey Taylor of Slipknot and Chilly Gonzales .
Roach is the primary producer for the comedy bands Ninja Sex Party and Starbomb ; and in 2022 , they released a single alongside Dan Avidan who 's from both those bands , as their new rock duo Shadow Academy .

Spiros Simitis ( ; born 19 October 1934 ) is an internationally respected Greek-German jurist and a pioneer in the field of data protection . In recognition of their role , admirers sometimes describe them as `` the man who invented data protection '' .
They were appointed Chief Data Protection Commissioner for the state of Hessen in 1975 , and remained in post till 1991 . When the West German government prepared for the 1978 launch of a national equivalent , they were seen by commentators as the obvious choice for the post of Federal Commissioner for Data Protection . They were indeed offered the job , but they rejected it in protest against the government decision , taken shortly before launch , to cut the resources allocated to the new department . That involved reducing the staffing level at the new commission from 32 - `` previously agreed as necessary '' - to 20 . `` The state of Bavaria on its own is budgeting no fewer than twenty data-protection staff for the coming year - a telling comparison '' ( `` Allein das Land Bayern sehe für Datenschutz-Aufgaben in seinem eigenen Bereich im kommenden Jahr nicht weniger als zwanzig Bedienstete vor -- eine `` bezeichnende Relation '' '' ) .
Spiros Simitis obtained West German citizenship in 1975 . Their younger brother , Costas Simitis , served as Prime Minister of Greece and was leader of the Panhellenic Socialist Movement ( PASOK ) between 1996 and 2004 .
Biography
Spiros Simitis was born in Athens . Georgios Simitis , their father , was a lawyer and law professor . They completed their schooling in Athens . Directly after that , with their brother Costas Simitis , they moved to West Germany for university-level education in law . The brothers studied at the University of Marburg , where between 1952 and 1956 Spiros Simitis worked for their degree and doctorate in jurisprudence . They received their doctorate for work completed in 1956 on `` Actual contractual relationships as an expression of the changing social purpose of legal principals in civil law '' ( `` Die faktischen Vertragsverhältnisse als Ausdruck der gewandelten sozialen Funktion der Rechtsinstitute des Privatrechts '' ) . They then moved a short distance south , to Frankfurt University , where they worked as a research assistant till 1962/63 . Their ambition was to make their career in the universities sector : accordingly , in 1963 they received their habilitation at Frankfurt . Their dissertation was entitled ( loosely translated ) , `` The significance of the welfare state principle in family and company law '' ( `` Der Sozialstaatgrundsatz in seiner Bedeutung fuer das Recht von Familie und Unternehmen '' ) . Although the risks associated with unregulated accumulation by public bodies of vast quantities of personal data were already appearing on the horizon among academics familiar with developments in database technology , their habilitation was not concerned with Data Protection , the speciality which by the end of the 1960s had become the focus of their work .
Around the time they submitted their dissertation Simitis met the Freudian psychoanalyst-scholar Ilse Grubrich at the home of their friend , the sociologist-philosopher Jürgen Habermas and their wife Ute . The wedding ceremony for Spiros and Ilse Simitis took place on 3 August 1963 , following the Greek Orthodox rite which on this occasion , as one impressed academic colleague noted , involved `` dancing around the bride and groom with floral wreaths '' .
Their next move was to the recently reinstated Law Faculty at the nearby University of Giessen , where between 1964 and 1969 they were employed as a full professor in Private law and Interjurisdictional Private law , along with Trade and Commercial law . Returning to Frankfurt in 1969 , they took a professorship in Labour law , Civil law and Legal informatics , with a particular focus on Data Protection . Simitis is director of the Research Centre for Data Protection at Frankfurt University and is , or has been , a guest professor at the University of California , Berkeley ( 1976 ) , Strasbourg University ( 1987-1988 ) and Yale University ( 1981-2000 ) .
Spiros Simitis authored the Data Protection Act for the state of Hessen which came into force in its original form on 13 October 1970 and is widely seen as the world 's first statute on data protection . It was from the start , in their words , a `` reaction to the constant refinement and evolution of Information Technology '' ( als `` Reaktion auf eine sich ständig weiterentwickelnde und verfeinernde Informationstechnologie '' ) . In 1975 they took German citizenship , and this opened the way for them to take over as Chief Data Protection Commissioner for the state of Hessen in succession to Willi Birkelbach , although sources make clear that in reality theirs was the defining contribution from the establishment of the department in 1970 .
At the start of 1978 the West German government launched the Federal Commission for Data Protection ( `` Bundesbeauftragter für den Datenschutz '' / BfD ) , a nationwide version of the Data Protection Commission that had operated in Hessen since the start of the decade , and closely modeled on it . As the man who had designed the Hessen Data Protection Commission , Spiros Simitis was seen as an obvious candidate to head up the national version of it . The job was indeed offered to them by Interior Minister Werner Maihofer . Simitis and Maihofer discussed plans for the new commission in some detail and agreed to an initial headcount of 32 for it . In November 1977 it emerged that Simitis had turned down the post , however , and cabinet minutes indicated that the government had agreed to a headcount level of only 20 . Simitis had refused the job because proper resourcing for the national Data Protection Commission , as previously agreed , would not be forthcoming . The legislation for the creation of the national Data Protection Commissioner had specified that the identity of the country 's first head of Data Protection would be determined by July 1977 . With the post still unfilled in November 1977 , commentators inferred a lack of commitment to data protection on the part of the government which the powerful IG Metall trades union saw as an `` alarm signal for every citizen '' ( ein `` Alarmsignal für alle Bürger '' ) . At the eleventh hour Hans Peter Bull was appointed West Germany 's first Federal Commissioner for Data Protection . They took on the office in an atmosphere of widespread continuing scepticism on the challenges involved in Information Technology legislation .
Memberships and commissions
Spiros Simitis has been a member of the German Council for International Private Law since 1966 . Between 1966 and 1980 they were General Secretary of the International Data Commission ( Generalsekretär der Internationalen Zivilstandskommission ) . In addition , between 1979 and 1982 they were a member of the standing deputation for Data Protection of the German Jurists Convention ( Deutscher Juristentag ) , and between 1982 and 1986 they served as chair of the Council of Europe 's Experts Commission on Data Protection questions . Since 1988 they have served as permanent advisor to the European Commission on Data Protection questions .
They served between 1990 and 1996 on the research council of the European University Institute in Florence , in 1994 as advisor to the ILO on creating a system for regulating employee data protection , and between 1998 and 1999 as chair of the European Commission 's High-level-expert-commission on the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union . Between 1999 and 2001 they were a member of the strategy commission dealing with further development of the European University Institute ( Florence ) and in 2001 , through a German cabinet resolution , they joined the National Ethics Council ( `` Nationaler Ethikrat '' ) , chairing it till 2005 . They served on it again between 2008 and 2012 ( by which time the former `` Nationaler Ethikrat '' had been renamed as the `` Deutscher Ethikrat '' ) .
Recognition and celebration
During their professional career Spiros Simitis has received a succession of honours from international commissions and academic institutions . They have been an honorary doctor of the Democritus University of Thrace since 1992 , and also , since 2003 , of the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens . They have been an honorary member of the German Jurists Convention ( Deutscher Juristentag ) since 2002 and a corresponding member of the Academy of Athens since 2003 .

Reception
DVD Verdict panned the film , writing `` The Lost Son has its heart in the right place , but it fumbles the ball by presenting an idea with great potential in a fairly lackluster package . There is not enough substance here to make the film worthy of a purchase . '' The Herald was mixed in their review , stating that Menges `` handles the unpleasant aspects in Eric and Margaret Leclere 's script with tact '' but that the film had too many unbelievable moments .

O. Carl Simonton ( born 29 June 1942 in Los Angeles , died 18 June 2009 in Agoura Hills ) was a specialist in radiology and oncology most notable for their unproven cancer treatment methods .
Career
They founded and directed the Simonton Cancer Center ( SCC ) in Malibu ( USA ) and was one of the pioneers of psycho-oncology . For over 30 years they worked with cancer patients who wanted to actively support their recovery process . Key elements of their philosophy and techniques affect the practical consulting work in the psycho-oncology in the United States , Europe and Japan .
Criticism
Simonton was the author of the book Getting Well Again ( 1992 ) . They claimed that cancer can be treated by relaxation and visualization techniques and that patients were healed using their methods . However , an investigation into five of their most impressive cases discovered that some of their patients had undergone standard treatment or probably did not have cancer to begin with . Medical health experts describe their therapy as dubious .
Physician Edward R. Friedlander , who investigated Simonton 's techniques in depth , noted that although some patients found their approach helpful , their case histories are `` very poor evidence '' for the claim that their treatment controls tumours .
Psychologist Tomasz Witkowski devoted a whole chapter of their book Psychology Led Astray : Cargo Cult in Science and Therapy to Simonton and their method and concluded : `` A deadly illness and its terminus are extreme situations ; too difficult to be judged from the perspective of an outsider . However , when the process is joined by professionals , not only can we , but we should assess what they are doing . The effectiveness of psychotherapy according to the methods of O. Carl Simonton has , for almost forty years , not been verified in accordance with the standards applicable in science and medicine . The majority of trustworthy studies indicates that the descriptions of effectiveness in advertisements for the method are false . The sources invoked by its supporters account neither for the position of the American Cancer Society , nor other critical studies ( … ) '' .
The American Cancer Society issued a statement entitled Unproven Methods of Cancer Management that summarized Simonton 's methods by : `` After careful study of the literature and other information available to it , the American Cancer Society does not have evidence that treatment with O. Carl Simonton 's psychotherapy method results in objective benefit in the treatment of cancer in human beings '' .

, known by their alias Suda51 , is a Japanese video game designer , writer and director . Affiliated with Human Entertainment from 1994 to 1998 , they founded Grasshopper Manufacture in 1998 with a number of other Human Entertainment staff to produce their own titles . Their best-known work has come from Grasshopper Manufacture , including The Silver Case ( 1999 ) , Killer7 ( 2005 ) , and the No More Heroes series .
Suda is from Nagano Prefecture , moving to Tokyo at the age of 18 and eventually being hired by Human Entertainment after having a number of other jobs including as an undertaker . Their first projects were in the Fire Pro Wrestling and Twilight Syndrome series . At Grasshopper Manufacture , they worked on their debut title The Silver Case as writer and director . The Silver Case helped establish both Suda and their company in Japan , but Suda and Grasshopper gained international attention with the release of Killer7 , Suda 's first title to be released outside Japan . They have contributed to most of the company 's projects , taking on a more managerial role following the first No More Heroes in 2007 .
Suda 's work is characterized by a focus on themes of crime and the clash of people with different ideals . While their early works adopted a serious tone , their later projects incorporated elements of humor . Sexual elements have also made appearances in their work , to the point where they became worried they would become too heavily associated with him . Aspects of their work have been influenced by film and literature , with one of their favorite authors being Franz Kafka , and incorporated references to popular sport and music .
Biography
Early and personal life
Goichi Suda was born in the city of Ueda in Japan 's Nagano Prefecture on January 2 , 1968 , and lived in the region until moving to Tokyo when they were eighteen . Suda has spoken little of their early life , but they did not have a good relationship with their family , and disliked living in Nagano despite its natural beauty . They wished to design video games from an early age . While distant from their family in Nagano , Suda is married and has their own family in Tokyo . Among their early jobs were working at Sega as a graphics designer for their brochures . One of their more notable jobs was as an undertaker , although they were more involved with flower arrangements . Still determined on a career in video games , and with encouragement from their wife , they applied to both Atlus and Human Entertainment , the latter known for the Fire Pro Wrestling series . They managed to get an interview with and hired by Human Entertainment . In later years , Suda would come to be known by the nickname `` Suda51 '' . The name is a pun based on the two parts of their given name— '' go '' translates to `` 5 '' and `` ichi '' to `` 1 '' .
Career
Suda 's first job at Human was as a director for Super Fire Pro Wrestling III ( 1993 ) , which earned them praise from the company due to the quality of their work . Due to this , they were appointed as both director and writer for Super Fire Pro Wrestling Special ( 1994 ) , which gained long-term notoriety for the bleak tone of its story and ending . Following Super Fire Pro Wrestling III , Suda worked on the Twilight Syndrome series ; they initially had to step in as producer and director for Twilight Syndrome , but they had greater creative input in Moonlight Syndrome ( 1998 ) : one of their decisions was to shift Moonlight Syndrome away from supernatural into psychological horror . Suda , who had gathered a fan base from their work at Human , generated controversy by killing off the main character in Moonlight Syndrome . Moonlight Syndrome would be the last game worked on by Suda for Human Entertainment , as they left due to being unsatisfied with available money bonuses . They also sensed that Human Entertainment , which would declare bankruptcy the following year , was not a secure position . After leaving Human Entertainment in 1998 , Suda founded Grasshopper Manufacture to fulfill their wish to create original video game projects . Its debut title was The Silver Case for the PlayStation . They were initially approached by ASCII Entertainment , who acted as the game 's publishers and provided funding . Suda acted as director , co-writer and designer for the game . Alongside this , Suda had the responsibility of acting as the studio 's CEO , so they felt responsible for ensuring everyone got paid .
The Silver Case was a success in Japan and helped establish Grasshopper Manufacture , although had limited critical success due to the proliferation of its visual novel style at the time . Suda 's next game at Grasshopper Manufacture was Flower , Sun , and Rain , developed for the PlayStation 2 . As with The Silver Case , Suda directed , wrote and designed for the game . Flower , Sun , and Rain was almost cancelled when ASCII Entertainment changed its policies and withdrew funding . Suda pitched to other publishers , eventually gaining the support of Victor Interactive Software . This would begin a trend for Grasshopper Manufacture of picking new publishers for each project so as to remain an independent company . Suda next acted as a producer and designer for Michigan : Report from Hell . Suda also created the initial concept around the idea of mist , but then created the camera-based and monstrous aspects to evoke terror .
Their next title , Killer7 , was their breakout title in the West and garnered mainstream public attention for both Suda and their studio . Suda acted as scenario writer , designer and director . Development began in 2002 as part of a pentalogy of video games dubbed the Capcom Five , a set of games overseen by Shinji Mikami and intended to be exclusive to the GameCube . Suda was given high creative freedom by Mikami , allowing Suda to create an experimental game for an international audience . Their next major title was No More Heroes for the Wii , which further established Suda 's international reputation . Suda developed the title for the Wii as they had been one of the first to see the hardware first-hand , and saw the possibilities of the Wii controls for sword-based action . While sharing elements with Killer7 , Suda adopted a lighter tone and style to suit their vision for the characters and story . Following No More Heroes , Suda took on a supervisory role for the majority of future Grasshopper projects including the No More Heroes sequel Desperate Struggle . They continued to be involved with writing and planning for Shadows of the Damned , Lollipop Chainsaw , Black Knight Sword and Killer is Dead . Suda returned as a director for the next two titles in the No More Heroes series ; the spin-off Travis Strikes Again ( 2019 ) , and the third and intended final mainline entry No More Heroes III ( 2021 ) .
Collaborative work
Alongside their original work , Suda collaborated with other companies and video game creators on a variety of original and licensed projects . They directed and wrote the video games Blood+ : One Night Kiss and Samurai Champloo : Sidetracked for Bandai Namco . According to him , depending on the type of project an exterior studio wants , elements unique to Suda and Grasshopper may be present or toned down in their licensed projects . Suda collaborated with Mikami on both Killer7 and Shadows of the Damned , with the former proving the better experience . They later attributed much of the design and scenario concept for Shadows of the Damned to Massimo Guarini , including the in-game weapon character Big Boner . They collaborated on Lollipop Chainsaw with America writer-director James Gunn , who co-wrote the script with Suda and helped extensively with the English version . Suda 's guidance in the studio is credited with helping the company balance its original work with licensed collaborations , and prominent staff from other companies joining Grasshopper .
Suda was one of four major Japanese developers to contribute to the compilation video game Guild01 alongside Yoot Saito , Yasumi Matsuno and Yoshiyuki Hirai : Suda 's contribution , Liberation Maiden , later released as a standalone title and spawning a visual novel sequel written by Suda . Suda worked as a designer , co-director and co-writer on Fatal Frame : Mask of the Lunar Eclipse , the fourth entry in the Fatal Frame series . The project was a collaboration between Tecmo Koei , Grasshopper Manufacture and Nintendo SPD . Suda and Grasshopper also collaborated on Short Peace , a media project involving four anime shorts and a video game titled Ranko Tsukigime 's Longest Day : all properties within Short Peace shared a common theme of representing different periods of Japanese history and culture . Suda created the initial concept , then gave the project to Tokyo Jungle producer Yohei Kataoka , having been impressed by Tokyo Jungle and wanting someone who could do `` crazy '' work . Outside gaming , Suda collaborated with Hideo Kojima as scenario writer for Sdatcher , a radio drama based on Kojima 's early video game Snatcher .
Works
Design philosophy and influences
Suda 's style of writing and direction has been compared by game journalists to the work of Quentin Tarantino . During their work on The Silver Case , they paid great attention to the opening 's editing , something which confused and annoyed other staff members . Suda has stated in numerous interviews that their work is inspired by `` punk '' , referring to the breaking of traditional game rules rather than the music genre . In explaining this concept , Suda said that many games were basically `` copycats '' , mimicking other successful titles in their gameplay and themes rather than striving for something groundbreaking or unconventional . Their game design philosophy was influenced by innovative games from their childhood developed by North America and Europe , as the Japanese market at the time seemed lacking in variety . While the term `` punk '' is generally associated with Punk rock music in Japan , Suda used the word in its ideological sense , breaking the mold on accepted conventions and deliberately making games outside current trends . Following this philosophy , Suda dislikes making games based on other people 's concepts , instead preferring their own concepts and designs . Despite taking on a less involved role with later titles due to the growing demands of their position as company CEO , Suda continues to seek deeper involvement with projects .
Multiple sources have influenced Suda 's work , from literature to games to foreign and domestic films and television . Their favorite author is Franz Kafka , a German language author who focused on a combination of mundane and surreal scenarios . Suda 's liking of Kafka was originally expressed in Kurayami , an in-development title based on The Castle , with a focus on nighttime combat and survival . Kurayami would eventually evolve into Shadows of the Damned . Numerous films have inspired elements of Suda 's work on The Silver Case , Killer7 and the No More Heroes series . When creating Lollipop Chainsaw , Suda used the series Buffy the Vampire Slayer to flesh out their initial concept . Popular culture has also played a part in Suda 's work , with several characters in their games being named after or being homages to sports people or pop singers . They also draw inspiration from and references a number of rock bands including The Stranglers and The Smiths .
A defining part of Suda 's original work has been its balance of humor , dark or mature themes , violence and sexuality . Their focus on death is because they feel it needs a rationale behind it , and so they focus on those closely tied with death such as assassins . In their action titles , they considered the reasons behind each character 's wish to fight and the reason for their deaths . Their portrayal of death in their games was influenced by their time as an undertaker . Sexuality , while a big part of many of Suda 's works , is not an important element from their perspective , and when used they are attempting to express a core part of the overall story and theme ; some elements of their later work had them worried that Grasshopper and themselves would become associated with erotic content . Another recurring theme in their work from The Silver Case onwards is the focus on the criminal elements in society , in addition to people with equally valid views coming into conflict with each other . Following the serious tone of The Silver Case , Flower , Sun , and Rain saw a stylistic shift to a more light and casual tone . This approach of switching styles for each successive original project would be repeated by Suda throughout their career : when talking about the contrast between Lollipop Chainsaw and Killer is Dead they described it as a yin-yang effect .
During the early part of their career , Suda worked on adventure games without an emphasis on action . This was due to their previous work at Human Entertainment being in the adventure game and visual novel genres . Due to having a larger staff , Flower , Sun , and Rain shifted away from the text-drive style of The Silver Case , beginning the company 's and Suda 's shift towards more action-based gameplay . Beginning with Killer7 , Suda incorporated further action elements at Mikami 's insistence . This shift in style continued following the anime tie-ins , with the gameplay of Sidetracked and One Night Kiss directly inspiring them when designing the action gameplay of No More Heroes . Michigan : Report from Hell and Fatal Frame : Mask of the Lunar Eclipse are the only titles Suda directly worked on to focus on horror , a genre Suda generally dislikes .
Some of their work has seen outside interference from publishers . Their original scenario for Blood+ , where the protagonist would be a monster clone killed at the end of the story , was vetoed . The overtly sexual elements in Lollipop Chainsaw and Killer Is Dead were likewise not their decision , but rather included at the insistence is the Japanese publisher Kadokawa Games . Shadows of the Damned in particular suffered from creative clashes with the publisher Electronic Arts , who requested changes catering to the Western market such as incorporating guns , and required five redrafts of the scenario before they approved it . Suda and Mikami both disliked the end product due to the publisher 's creative interference , with Mikami in particular saying that Shadows of the Damneds final form broke Suda 's heart .

Laanecoorie Weir or Laanecoorie Reservoir , is a water storage for irrigation and domestic purposes on the Loddon River , near the towns of Laanecoorie , Victoria and Eddington , Victoria . It was constructed by contractor Andrew O'Keefe ( engineer ) ( died 1904 ) in conjunction with Joshua Thomas Noble Anderson . This was the second irrigation scheme for Victoria after the Goulburn Weir . Construction commenced in 1889 and took three years to complete . The largest outlet valves in Victoria , manufactured by the United Iron Work of Abraham Roberts , were installed at the weir in 1891 .
The great flood of 1909 breached the weir , sending 18.3 million cubic metres of water through the opening and causing severe damage to all towns downstream .
The first bridge at Laanecoorie over the Loddon River was built in 1870 , but was destroyed in the flood of 1909 , along with the weir . The famous World War I general , Sir John Monash , designed and built a new bridge of reinforced concrete beam and slab construction , which still remains today .
The present capacity of the Laanecoorie Reservoir is about 7770 ML , although substantial siltation since its construction has reduced the original capacity by an estimated 12000 ML . The towns of Tarnagulla , Dunolly , and Laanecoorie obtain supply by diversion from the Loddon River downstream of the reservoir .

ATM Adaptation Layer 2 ( AAL2 ) is an Asynchronous Transfer Mode ( ATM ) adaptation layer , used primarily in telecommunications ; for example , it is used for the Iu interfaces in the Universal Mobile Telecommunications System , and is also used for transporting digital voice . The standard specifications related to AAL2 are ITU standards I.363.2 and I366.1 .
What is AAL2 ?
AAL2 is a variable-bitrate connection-oriented low-latency service originally intended to adapt voice for transmission over ATM . Like other ATM adaptation layers , AAL2 defines segmentation and reassembly of higher-layer packets into ATM cells , in this case packets of data containing voice and control information . AAL2 is further separated into two sub-layers that help with the mapping from upper-layer services to ATM cells . These are named Service Specific Convergence Sub-layer ( SSCS ) and Common Part Sub-layer ( CPS ) .
The AAL2 protocol improves on other ATM Adaptation Layers , by packing lots of small packets efficiently into one standard-sized ATM cell of 53 bytes . A one-byte packet thus no longer has an overhead ratio of 52 unused bytes out of 53 ( i.e . 98 % ) . Potentially , total of 11 one-byte CPS packets ( plus 3/4 of a 12th CPS packet ) could squeeze into a single cell . Of course , CPS packets can come in other sizes with other CIDs , too . When the transmission is ready , the CPS packets are all multiplexed together into a single cell and transported over standard ATM network infrastructure .
The transport networks for ATM are well standardized fiber optic ( SDH/Sonet , i.e . STM-1/OC-3 or higher ) or copper cable ( PDH , i.e . E1/T1/JT1 or higher bandwidth fixed lines ) based synchronous networks with built-in redundancy and OAM-related network features which Ethernet networks never had originally ( in order to keep things simple ) but are sorely missed in metro Ethernet standard networks .
Efforts to improve Ethernet networks are in a sense trying to reinvent the wheel à la ATM . AAL2 is one example of a useful benefit of ATM , as a general standard for Layer 2 protocols . ATM/AAL2 's efficient handling of small packets contrasts with Ethernet 's minimum payload of 46 bytes vs the 1-byte minimum size for an AAL2 CPS packet .
AAL2 is the standard layer 2 protocol used in all Iu interfaces , i.e . the interfaces between UMTS base stations and UMTS Radio Network Controllers ( RNCs ) ( Iu-B ) , inter-RNCs ( Iu-R ) , UMTS RNCs and UMTS Serving GPRS Support Nodes ( SGSNs ) ( Iu-PS ) , and UMTS RNCs and media gateways ( MGWs ) ( Iu-CS ) .
AAL2 and the ATM Cell
The basic component of AAL2 is the CPS packet . A CPS packet is an unanchored unit of data that can cross ATM cells and can start from anywhere in the payload of the ATM cell , other than the start field ( STF ) . The STF is the first byte of the 48-byte ATM payload . The STF gives the byte index into the ATM cell where the first CPS packet in this cell begins . Byte 0 is the STF . The data from byte 1 ... ( STF+1 ) , would be the straddled remainder of the previous ATM cell 's final CPS packet . If there is no remainder from the previous cell , the STF is 0 , and the first byte of the cell after the STF is also the location of the start of the first CPS packet .
The format for the 1 byte STF at the beginning of the ATM cell is :
6 bits - offset field ( OSF )
1 bit - sequence number ( SN )
1 bit - parity ( P )
OSF
The Offset Field carries the binary value of the offset , in octets , between the end of the P bit and the start of the CPCS-PDU Payload . Values of greater than 47 are not allowed .
SN
The Sequence Number numbers the stream of CPCS-PDUs .
P
The Parity bit is used to detect error in the OSF and SN fields .
If the ATM cell has fewer than 47 bytes , the remainder will be filled by padding .
AAL2u
One common adaptation of AAL2 , AAL2u , does n't use the STF field at all . In this case , one single CPS packet is aligned to the beginning of the cell . AAL2u is not used in standardized interfaces , but rather in proprietary equipment implementations where the multiplexing/demultiplexing , etc . that needs to be done for standard AAL2 either is too strenuous , is unsupported , or requires too much overhead ( i.e . the 1 byte of STF ) from the internal system 's point of view . Most computer chips do not support AAL2 , so stripping this layer away makes it easier to interwork between the ATM interface and the rest of the network .
ATM AAL2 Cell Diagram
The following is diagram of the AAL2 ATM cell :
AAL2 and the CPS Packet
A CPS packet has a 3-byte header and a payload of between one and 45 octets . The standard also defines a 64-octet mode , but this is not commonly used in real 3G networks .
The 3-byte CPS header has the following fields :
8 bits - channel identifier ( CID )
6 bits - length indicator ( LI )
5 bits - user to user indication ( UUI )
5 bits - header error control ( HEC )
CID
The Channel Identifier identifies the user of the channel . The AAL2 channel is a bi-directional channel and the same channel identification value is used for both directions . The maximum number of multiplexed user channels is 248 . As some channels are reserved for other uses , such as peer-to-peer layer management .
CE : Channel Element
CID = CE -E + ID
LI
The Length Indicator indicates the length ( in number of octets ) of the CPS information field , and can have a value between 1 and 45 ( default ) or sometimes between 1 and 64 . For a given CID all channels must be of the same maximum length ( either 45 or 64 octets ) NB : the LI is one less than the actual length of the payload , so 0 corresponds to the minimum length of 1 octet , and 0x3f to 64 octets .
UUI
User to User Indication conveys specific information transparently between the users . For example , in SSSAR , UUI is used to indicate that this is the final CPS packet for the SSSAR PDU .
HEC
This is Header Error Control and checks for errors in the CID , LI and UUI fields . The generator polynomial for the CPS HEC is :

Tyndale Academy was an independent , fee-paying tuition group in East London for children aged 4 to 11 years of age . The academy , based at the Hope Baptist Chapel had an evangelical Christian ethos but accepted children from all faiths or none . It was established in 1999 and was named after the English church reformer William Tyndale who as well as being a Bible translator was a tutor of children .
Corporal punishment
During its operation Tyndale Academy was one of a very small number of educational settings in the United Kingdom that still condoned corporal punishment as part of its sanctions policy . Although corporal punishment was banned in the United Kingdom schools , Tyndale Academy was able to continue the practise legally as pupils only attended on a part-time basis . As institutions whose pupils attend for less than 21 hours per week do not fall under the legal definition of a school , they are unaffected by the law preventing the use of corporal punishment .
This practice caused controversy in 2008 when the government discussed proposals in the Education and Skills Bill 2007 which would embrace Tyndale Academy as an independent educational institution and so render its discipline policy illegal .
After the 2008 Education and Skills Bill
Following the passing into law of the Education and Skills Bill ( 2008 ) Tyndale continued to operate . Over a year after the enactment of the Bill , the DCSF had not undertaken the consultation process which would establish the regulatory framework defining Independent Educational Institutions . This has theoretically meant that it has been possible for Tyndale to continue without any substantive changes to its provision . Draft versions of the Regulations state that the Department is minded to count breaktimes , assemblies and lunch hours as `` time during which education is provided '' . This would break with the criteria that is strictly applied to all state run and independent schools .
The Department for Children Schools and Families held 11 box files of material on Tyndale the bulk of which it refused to release , arguing legal and ministerial exemptions ..
An in depth interview with Ferris Lindsay , Tyndale 's proprietor , took place in the Times Educational Supplement on 20 November 2009 . In it , their views on corporal punishment and the broader matters of what motivated them in establishing Tyndale are discussed .

The Allnatt Diamond is a diamond measuring 101.29 carats ( 20.258 g ) with a cushion cut , rated in color as Fancy Vivid Yellow by the Gemological Institute of America . This diamond was named after one of its holders , Major Alfred Ernest Allnatt , a soldier , sportsman , art patron and benefactor .
The Allnatt 's origins are unknown prior to Major Allnatt 's purchasing of the diamond in the early 1950s . After purchasing the diamond , they commissioned Cartier to make a setting for it . The final setting was a platinum flower with five petals , a stem and two leaves , all set with diamonds . The Allnatt was resold at auction in May 1996 by Christie 's in Geneva for $ 3,043,496 US . At the time of its sale the Allnatt was . and was graded Fancy Intense Yellow . After being sold to the SIBA Corporation , the diamond was re-cut to its current weight and the intensity was upgraded as a result .
The Allnatt was displayed as part of the Smithsonian 's `` The Splendor of Diamonds '' exhibit , alongside The De Beers Millennium Star and The Heart of Eternity .

Theodora ( Thora ) Frederikke Marie Daugaard ( 22 October 1874 – 28 June 1951 ) was a Danish women 's rights activist , pacifist , editor and translator . In 1915 , they attended the International Women 's Conference in The Hague , together with Clara Tybjerg . Thereafter they established and later headed the Danske Kvinders Fredskæde or Danish Women 's Peace Chain which became the Danish branch of the Women 's International League for Peace and Freedom . They are also remembered for organizing assistance for Jews and their children in Nazi-occupied Denmark during the Second World War .
Biography
Born on 22 October 1874 in Store Arden near Hobro , Jutland , Theodora Frederikke Marie Daugaard was the daughter of the hotel keeper Peder Johannes Jensen ( 1841–1903 ) and Petrine Daugaard ( 1848–1925 ) . After receiving an education as a translator in 1903 , they were employed by the Danish Women 's Society as editorial secretary for their journal Kvinden og Samfundet and as business manager of their new office . Working together with Esther Carstensen , Gyrithe Lemche and Astrid Stampe Feddersen , they joined the organization 's electoral committee , becoming its international secretary until 1915 when Danish women won the right to vote .
Thereafter , they devoted their efforts principally to the peace movement , attending the 1915 International Women 's Conference in the Hague where they announced : `` We want war no longer . We no longer want it explained that we women are protected by war . No , we are raped by war ! '' . The following year , they established the Danish Women 's Peace Chain . From 1920 to 1941 , they became the association 's president , raising membership to 15,000 .
In 1918 , based on their experiences abroad , they initiated the construction of a home for single , self-employed women with almost 150 apartments , a restaurant and a laundry . When it was completed in 1920 as Clara Raphaels Hus on Copenhagen 's Østerbro , Daugaard moved in herself . The following year , they were engaged as editor of a new weekly magazine Tidens Kvinder which until 1923 was published by Danske Kvinders Nationalråd . They also edited the magazine published by Kvindernes Internationale Liga for Fred og Frihed , the new name of Danske Kvinders Fredskæde . From 1930 to 1932 , they edited Vore Damer which was similar to Tidens Kvinder .
Invited by the American social worker Jane Addams who was president of the Women 's International League for Peace and Freedom , they made a lecture tour of the United States from 1927 to 1929 . In 1934 , Daugaard represented the WILPF at the League of Nations , becoming the League 's international treasurer from 1938 to 1946 .
In 1938 to 1939 , together with Mélanie Oppenhejm and Kirsten Gloerfelt-Tarp , they were active in saving Jewish children from the Nazi countries , succeeding in having 320 sent to Denmark . During the Nazi occupation of Denmark , most of them were sent to Sweden . Them involvement with the Jews forced them into fleeing to Sweden themselves in 1943 .
Thora Daugaard died on 28 June 1951 in Holstebro and was buried at Mariager Abbey .

Cavitation is the formation of cavities , which are spaces or openings in the body . This process occurs in mammalian embryos , and can also occur later on in fully developed organisms . During mammalian embryo development , cavitation is a routine process ; however , the formation of cavities in fully developed organs , especially in lung tissue , is usually the sign of a severe medical condition or disease , such as tuberculosis .
Developmental
Cavitation is a crucial process in the development of mammalian embryos . After fertilization , rapid cell division occurs which results in the formation of the morula , or a solid ball of cells . The morula is the precursor structure to the blastula , which is an animal embryo in the early stages of development . The morula consists of a cluster of internal cells covered by a layer of external cells . The internal cells become the inner cellular mass , which becomes the entire embryo . The external cells are destined to become a structure called the trophoblast , a layer of tissue on the inside of the embryo that provides it with nourishment . The trophoblast cells become extraembryonic structures necessary for development . After the initial formation of the morula , it does not have an interior space or cavity . Cavitation occurs to create a cavity on the inside of the morula . This process occurs when trophoblast cells , in other words the outside covering of the blastocyst , secretes fluid into the morula creating the blastocoel , the fluid filled cavity of the blastula . The formation of the blastocoel is a critical stage in the formation of the blastocyst , which is a blastula where some cellular differentiation has already occurred .

The one-factor-at-a-time method , also known as one-variable-at-a-time , OFAT , OF @ T ,
OFaaT , OVAT , OV @ T , OVaaT , or monothetic analysis is a method of designing experiments involving the testing of factors , or causes , one at a time instead of multiple factors simultaneously .
Advantages
OFAT is favored by non-experts , especially in situations where the data is cheap and abundant .
There exist cases where the mental effort required to conduct a complex multi-factor analysis exceeds the effort required to acquire extra data , in which case OFAT might make sense . Furthermore , some researchers have shown that OFAT can be more effective than fractional factorials under certain conditions ( number of runs is limited , primary goal is to attain improvements in the system , and experimental error is not large compared to factor effects , which must be additive and independent of each other ) .
Disadvantages
In contrast , in situations where data is precious and must be analyzed with care , it is almost always better to
change multiple factors at once . A middle-school-level example illustrating this point is the family of balance puzzles , which includes the Twelve Coins puzzle . At the undergraduate level , one could compare
Bevington 's GRIDLS versus GRADLS . The latter is far from optimal , but the former , which changes only one variable at a time , is worse . See also the factorial experimental design methods pioneered by Sir Ronald A. Fisher . Reasons for disfavoring OFAT include :
OFAT requires more runs for the same precision in effect estimation
OFAT can not estimate interactions
OFAT can miss optimal settings of factors .
Designed experiments remain nearly always preferred to OFAT with many types and methods available , in addition to fractional factorials which , though usually requiring more runs than OFAT , do address the three concerns above . One modern design over which OFAT has no advantage in number of runs is the Plackett-Burman which , by having all factors vary simultaneously ( an important quality in experimental designs ) , gives generally greater precision in effect estimation .

The Nubian woodpecker ( Campethera nubica ) is a species of bird in the family Picidae . It is distributed widely in Central and Eastern Africa , from Chad in west to Somalia in east and Tanzania in south . It is a fairly common species with a wide range , the population seems stable , and the International Union for Conservation of Nature has rated its conservation status as being of `` least concern '' .
Taxonomy
The Nubian woodpecker was described by the French polymath Georges-Louis Leclerc , Comte de Buffon in 1780 in their Histoire Naturelle des Oiseaux from a specimen collected in Nubia . The bird was also illustrated in a hand-coloured plate engraved by François-Nicolas Martinet in the Planches Enluminées D'Histoire Naturelle which was produced under the supervision of Edme-Louis Daubenton to accompany Buffon 's text . Neither the plate caption nor Buffon 's description included a scientific name but in 1783 the Dutch naturalist Pieter Boddaert coined the binomial name Picus nubicus in their catalogue of the Planches Enluminées . The Nubian woodpecker is now placed in the genus Campethera that was introduced by the English zoologist George Robert Gray in 1841 . The generic name combines the Ancient Greek kampē meaning `` caterpillar '' and -thēras meaning `` hunter '' .
Two subspecies are recognised :
C. n. nubica ( Boddaert , 1783 ) – Sudan and Ethiopia to northeast Democratic Republic of the Congo , southwest Tanzania and Kenya
C. n. pallida ( Sharpe , 1902 ) – south Somalia and coastal Kenya
Description
The Nubian woodpecker Is a medium-sized species growing to a length of about . The male has a red crown and nape and a reddish streak on the cheek , while the female has a black crown speckled with white , a red nape , and a dark cheek stripe with white speckling . In other respects , the sexes are similar . The upper parts are olive-brown with much cream speckling and barring . The wings are greenish-brown barred with white and the tail greenish-yellow barred with brown , the shafts of the feathers being gold . The throat is cream and the head , neck , breast and belly are white , spotted and barred with black . The beak is grey with a dark tip , the eye red or pink , the orbital ring grey and the feet olive or grey . Various vocalisations are made , shrill ringing or piping notes repeated , often musical but sometimes metallic . Often sung in duet .
Distribution and habitat
The Nubian woodpecker is endemic to eastern Africa . Its range includes Chad , Democratic Republic of the Congo , Djibouti , Eritrea , Ethiopia , Kenya , Somalia , South Sudan , Sudan , Tanzania and Uganda . Its typical habitat is open savannah woodland , especially with Acacia and Euphorbia , bushy areas and scrub . It is a non-migratory bird , and is found at altitudes up to .
Behaviour and ecology
The Nubian woodpecker often feeds alone , keeping in touch with its mate vocally . It forages mostly in trees , but also on the ground , for ants and termites , also consuming spiders and beetles .

Wang-y-tong ( also known as Wang-o-Tang , Whang Atong , Whang at Tong , Whang-at-Ting , Quang-at-Tong , Warnoton , Hwang-a-tung , or Huang Ya Dong ( 黃亞東 ) ) ( c. 1753 , fl . 1770s–1784 ) was a Chinese youth who visited England in the late 18th century . After the Christian convert Michael Shen Fuzong in 1687 , the merchant Loum Kiqua in 1756–1757 , and the artist Tan-Che-Qua in 1769 to 1772 , Wang is one of the earliest Chinese people known to have visited England .
Life
Little is known of Wang 's early life . Having heard about Tan-Che-Qua 's journey to and reception in England , Wang also decided to travel to England . They were brought to England from Canton by John Bradby Blake in the early 1770s . Blake was a supercargo for the East India Company , and also a naturalist , who was interested in Wang 's knowledge of cultivating Chinese plants , and their culinary and medicinal uses . After Blake 's death in 1773 , Wang was taken into the care of Blake 's father , Captain John Blake .
Wang visited the Royal Society on 12 January 1775 . In a letter of 1775 , they are said to be about 22 years old . They were visited at Blake 's house , where they discussed the manufacture of Chinese ceramics with Josiah Wedgwood , and acupuncture with physician Andrew Duncan .
They became a page to Giovanna Baccelli , a mistress of John Sackville , 3rd Duke of Dorset , and lived at Knole in Kent , attending the nearby Sevenoaks School . The Duke commissioned a portrait of Wang in 1776 , paying Joshua Reynolds 70 guineas , framed by Thomas Vialls . The painting is exhibited in the Reynolds Room at Knole , alongside portraits of other 18th century celebrities by Reynolds , including the Duke , Reynolds himself , Samuel Johnson , and David Garrick . In the Reynolds portrait , Wang is depicted sitting cross-legged on a bamboo chair , holding a fan , and wearing crimson and blue oriental robes , red shoes and a conical Asian hat . They have been described as a living example of chinoiserie . A portrait by George Dance the younger in pencil with watercolour is held by the British Museum , with Wang drawn in profile wearing European clothing .
Wang had returned to China before 1785 . In December 1784 , they were working as a trader in Canton when they replied to a letter from the linguist Sir William Jones asking for help with the translation of the Shijing .
Name
They are mentioned in several 18th-century sources on China , including a satire by Lichtenberg , Von den Kriegs- und Fast-Schulen der Schinesen ( published in the Göttinger Taschencalender for 1796 ) . Lichtenberg translated their name as `` yellow man from the east '' . It has been speculated that their family name may have been Huang and their given name Ya Dong – the characters of Huang and Dong also represent `` yellow '' and `` east '' – and their full name may have been Huang Ya Dong . This is supported by a note of their name , supposedly written in their own hand for Mary Delany , and copied into their letter to Mary Port of 11 June 1775 .
Wang is occasionally confused with or misidentified as Tan-Che-Qua ( or Tan Chitqua ) , a Chinese artist who arrived in England in 1769 , and exhibited their work at the Royal Academy in 1770 , but Tan-Che-Qua had returned to China in 1772 . Tan-Che-Qua was included in a group portrait of the Royal Academicians by Johann Zoffany . A portrait of Tan-Che-Qua , thought to be by John Hamilton Mortimer , is held by the Hunterian Museum at the Royal College of Surgeons in London .

The 1996 S.League was the 1st season of the S.League , the top professional football league in Singapore .
The S.League came into existence as a result of a fragmenting of relations between Singapore and Malaysian football associations . A dispute over the division of gate receipts for the Singapore representative in the Malaysian Premier League saw Singapore withdraw from the competition in 1995 , ending a footballing connection between the two nations that stretched back to 1921 , with the first participation of a Singapore team in the Malaya Cup .
The semi-professional FAS Premier League was founded in 1988 , but had failed to find support amongst the local communities and media . The S.League was therefore created to fill the need to have a fully professional football league within Singapore . The Football Association of Singapore invited applications for clubs to compete in the newly formed league . Eight successful applications were made , these eight teams took part in a two-stage league season , with the winner of each stage qualifying for the end of season championship decider . The first half of the season was known as the Tiger Beer Series and the second half was known as the Pioneer Series .
Geylang United defeated Singapore Armed Forces FC in the end of season championship Playoff to be crowned the 1st S.League champions .
Clubs
Eight sides took part in the first S.League campaign ; two of whom had been competitors in the former Singapore Premier League . These former Premier League clubs were Balestier United FC who changed their name upon joining the S.League to Balestier Central and the former Singapore Premier League powerhouse Geylang International , winners of six back-to-back Premier League titles , who renamed themselves Geylang United for the first S.League season . The rest were clubs drawn from the amateur National Football League : Police , Singapore Armed Forces , Tampines Rovers , Tiong Bahru United and Wellington Football Club , who renamed themselves Woodlands Wellington .
Sembawang Rangers were formed from a merger between two NFL sides , Gibraltar Crescent and Sembawang Sports Club .

Geylang were comfortably defeated by 1996 J.League champions Kashima Antlers in the first round of the East Asian half of the competition , Kashima finishing with an 8–2 aggregate win .

The Festival du Voyageur is an annual 10-day winter festival that takes place in Winnipeg , Manitoba , Canada . The event is held during each February in Winnipeg 's French quarter , Saint-Boniface , and is western Canada 's largest winter festival . It celebrates Canada 's fur-trading past and unique French heritage and culture through entertainment , arts and crafts , music , exhibits , and displays .
The word `` Voyageur '' refers to those who worked for a fur-trading company and usually travelled by canoe . In the case of Festival du Voyageur , the title of `` Official Voyageur '' is given to ambassadors of the festival .
History
The idea for a winter festival to celebrate Manitoba 's Francophonie was first proposed by Georges Forest , who became the first official `` Voyageur '' in 1967 . The proposal was put forth to the then-City of St. Boniface , but the city 's offer was insufficient .
In the summer of 1969 , mayor of St. Boniface Ed Turner , along with city council , granted their support under the condition that Festival became an incorporated organization . Judge Robert Trudel became the first president of Festival du Voyageur . Festival du Voyageur Inc. was incorporated under the Companies Act of Manitoba on 18 December 1969 . It received a city grant of $ 35,000 but had to give back all profits up to $ 35,000 .
At a press conference held on 13 January 1970 , mayor Turner announced that the city of Saint-Boniface would present a festival honouring the Voyageur of the fur-trading era , in celebration of Manitoba 's centennial . The first Festival du Voyageur took place that year from February 26 to March 1 , at Provencher Park , with an estimated attendance of 50,000 people . Acting as an 'ambassador ' for the event , Georges Forest promoted the event by wearing clothing that represented the Voyageurs . This initiated the tradition of `` Official Voyageurs '' , which continues to this day . The 1970 festival lasted four days and featured the walk down Provencher Boulevard , the Governor 's Bal and the Voyageur Trading Post .
A large number of attendees required an unforeseen level of expenditure by festival organizers ; by the festival 's conclusion , the organization had debt in excess of C $ 40,000 . To remedy their financial situation , the organizers held horse races as a fundraiser in conjunction with the 1971 festival . The 1971 festival was a success , drawing nearly 200,000 guests . However , instead of resolving the financial situation , the fundraiser pushed the organization further into debt .
The snow sculpture that won the 1971 event was of a pair of boots and a toque . This sculpture inspired the creation of a mascot , Léo La Tuque , who was introduced in 1972 and became the trademark of Festival du Voyageur .
Grants from the city of Winnipeg and the Secretary of State allowed the Festival to make arrangements with their creditors . The name was changed to `` Festival du Voyageur '' ( the `` of the '' was dropped ) . For the 1972 festival , Arthur D'Eschambault was elected president . They hired a number of financial and management directors ( most of whom were anglophone ) . The festival ran from February 21 to 27 , and the profits amounted to C $ 108.46 .
Two `` school '' voyageurs were appointed in 1977 , to visit schools and teach children about the voyageurs and Festival .
In 1977 , construction began on wooden log cabins in Whittier Park to accommodate the festival . The log cabins were constructed to be left there year-round . In 1978 , the organization had accumulated enough surplus funds to make Whittier Park the permanent site of the festival . Provencher Park had become too small for the growing number of attendees . These cabins formed the foundation of the historic reconstruction that became known as Fort Gibraltar .
In 1981 , the Festival du Voyageur purchased an empty warehouse , located at 768 Taché Avenue , for administrative offices and to be used for an additional venue . The building became known as the Rendez-Vous and eventually came to include a bar named Le Canot .
From February to October 2001 , a large house was constructed in Fort Gibraltar for the event . The house is called the Maison du Bourgeois .
The Rendez-Vous building on Taché was put up for sale in 2003 , and sold in 2006 . New administrative offices were found in a building at 233 Provencher Avenue , and it came to also feature a store called the Boutique du voyageur .
In 2005 , a year-round interpretive centre was built in Fort Gibraltar .
In 2011 , The Festival was awarded the Award of Excellence – Promotion of Linguistic Duality by the Commissioner of Official Languages Graham Fraser for its contribution to the vitality of the Franco-Manitoban Community .
Attendance
Current operation
In 2010 , Festival du Voyageur Inc. ( FDV Inc. ) received $ 438,174 from Industry Canada 's two-year Marquee Tourism Events Program ( MTEP ) . In 2011 , the festival saw 1,151 volunteers donate 14,393 hours of work .
The festival currently employs 13 full-time permanent staff and at the festivals peak employs roughly 200 people . The typical annual attendance is 100,000 people across all ten days of the festival .
The 2013 festival saw approximate revenue of $ 2.9 million .

Benzothiazine is a heterocyclic compound consisting of a benzene ring attached to the 6-membered heterocycle thiazine . The name is applied to both the 2H- and 4H-isomers of the molecule .
2,1-Benzothiazine , a type of benzothiazines was first reported in the 1960s . Subsequently , their preparation and intensive biological and physiological studies have been reported . In recent years , 2,1-benzothiazines have been of enormous interest to synthetic chemists . An enantioselective synthesis of such benzothiazines has been developed by Harmata and Hong who have formulated transformations of these compounds designed to target chiral , non-racemic building blocks as well as natural products .

The blue-capped tanager ( Sporathraupis cyanocephala ) is a species of bird in the tanager family Thraupidae . It was formerly placed in the genus Thraupis but is now the only species in the genus Sporathraupis .
It is found in Bolivia , Colombia , Ecuador , Peru , Trinidad and Tobago , and Venezuela . Its natural habitats are subtropical or tropical moist montane forests and heavily degraded former forest .
Taxonomy
The blue-capped tanager was formally described in 1837 by the French naturalists Alcide d'Orbigny and Frédéric de Lafresnaye from a specimen collected in the Bolivian Yungas . They coined the binomial name Aglaia cyanocephala . The species was usually placed in the genus Thraupis but when a molecular phylogenetic study published in 2014 found that it was not closely related to other members of Thraupis , it was moved to the resurrected genus Sporathraupis that had been erected in 1898 by Robert Ridgway with the blue-capped tanager as the type species . The genus name Sporathraupis combines the Ancient Greek spora meaning `` seed '' with thraupis , the word for an unknown small bird . The specific epithet combines the Ancient Greek kuanos meaning `` dark blue '' with -kephalos meaning `` -headed '' .
Eight subspecies are recognised :
S. c. cyanocephala ( d'Orbigny & Lafresnaye , 1837 ) – Ecuador , Peru and north Bolivia
S. c. annectens ( Zimmer , JT , 1944 ) – central , west Colombia
S. c. auricrissa ( Sclater , PL , 1856 ) – northeast Colombia and northwest Venezuela
S. c. margaritae Chapman , 1912 – north Colombia
S. c. hypophaea Todd , 1917 – northwest to north-central Venezuela
S. c. olivicyanea ( Lafresnaye , 1843 ) – north-central Venezuela
S. c. subcinerea ( Sclater , PL , 1861 ) – north-central to northeast Venezuela
S. c. buesingi Hellmayr & Seilern , 1913 – extreme northeast Venezuela and Trinidad

The Lake Tharthar raid was an Iraqi commando raid on a Secret Army of Islam training camp at Lake Tharthar on March 23 , 2005 .
Background
The training camp , located in a remote region near Lake Tharthar , next to the Sunni Anbar and Salahuddin provinces , was , according to Iraq officials , the largest guerrilla training camp discovered by that point in the war . The camp was shared by Ba'ath party loyalists and members of Al-Qaeda . The insurgents had planned to attack the city of Samarra , which was located some 55 kilometers ( 34 mi ) east of the lake , with a large number of car bombs . A concurrent operation had pushed the insurgents outside of the city and forced them to camp in a swampy area next to the lake . The remote site contained ramshackle huts and tents , several cars , and boats used by insurgents to cross the lake . The camp was well camouflaged and defended by mortars and machine gun nests . There were an estimated 120 insurgents in the camp at the time of the raid .
The raid
A battalion of Iraqi police commandos as well as 9 American Cavalry Scouts and 1 medic from 3rd Battalion 69th Armor Regiment and one local national interpreter were involved in the raid . The scout team was made up of a select group of soldiers from the battalion . Most were on their second combat tour and had seen extensive combat during the 2003 invasion of Iraq . They had been directed to assist the Iraqi forces as they conducted anti-insurgent operations . As the multi-national force approached the suspected insurgent camp , the Iraqi contingent split in two groups , one to the west , closer to the lakeshore and one to the east . The Americans followed the group to the west . While the group to the west moved south along the lakeshore and encountered little resistance , the group to the east came under intense fire . The commandos to the east dismounted their pickup trucks and attacked across an open field towards the camp . They immediately suffered heavy casualties from machine gun nests and indirect fire . Reacting to the heavy fire and pleas for help , the Americans detached themselves from the western element and rejoined the elements to the east . The Americans engaged the enemy with machine gun fire in order to allow the extraction of the commando wounded . With more than a dozen casualties , limited radio contact with other friendly forces , and their own vehicle shot out from under him , 1LT John Rowold made the decision to split their forces , sending half to establish radio contact and request air support while the other half maintained contact with the enemy . While 1LT Rowold and a handful of Iraqi commandos pressed the attack and attempted to draw fire from the wounded laying in the open field , medic Specialist Ray Michael Fuhrmann II , under constant fire himself , provided aid to the wounded , stopping only long enough to return fire with their sidearm or the rifles of the dead and wounded . After 45 minutes of intense combat the Americans were running low on ammunition when two OH-58D helicopters arrived at the battle , led by 1LT Michael Hultquist . 1LT Hultquist observed the enemy enveloping the battered and outnumbered American and Iraqi forces on the ground . With rocket and machine gun fire , the helicopters were able to break up the attack and force the insurgents to flee the area by boat . It was estimated that some 30 insurgents managed to escape during the fighting by boat across the lake bringing all killed or wounded insurgents with them .
Aftermath
Seven Iraqi commandos were killed in the raid and six were wounded . The Iraqi MoI estimated 84 insurgents were killed and the commandos claimed to have captured one of Algerian nationality . US Forces present however , were not able to confirm that any enemies were captured . After entering the camp , U.S. forces found non-Iraqi passports , training publications , propaganda documents , weapons and ammunition . According to the papers found some of the insurgents were of Moroccan , Algerian , Sudanese , Saudi , Syrian and Egyptian nationalities . U.S. Army Combat Medic Ray Michael Fuhrmann II ( killed in action on 18 August 2005 in Samarra , Iraq ) was awarded the Silver Star for their actions during the attack . The lead OH-58D pilot , 1LT Michael Hultquist received the Distinguished Flying Cross .
After reviewing footage of the raid , a coalition spokesperson said in reference to the number of Insurgents killed that `` somewhere between 11 and 80 lies an accurate number ... the insurgent forces who fled ... were able to recover their casualties and take them with them . ''

The Farhād Tarāsh ( ) , or Tarāsh-e Farhād is a long smoothed rock surface on Mount Behistun in western Iran . Located near the famous Behistun Inscription , its height is around 30 meters and its width is around 200 meters . The retaining wall in front of it is c. 150 meters . The work is registered as a national heritage in Iran , and it 's the biggest work of such kind in Iran . The Farhād Tarāsh has sparked interest from medieval geographers including Istakhri ( died 957 ) and Yaqut al-Hamawi ( died 1229 ) to travelers and archaeologists in modern times .
Creation
Various interpretations have been given about its creation . In the early 19th century , H. C. Rawlinson believed that the Tarāsh-e Farhād was originally meant to become the rear wall of a palace of Khosrow II ( 590–628 ) and was supposed to be decorated with a relief of Semiramis . In the early 20th century , L. W. King and R. C. Thompson viewed it as a site for a palace of a Sasanian king . Around the same period , A. V. Williams Jackson believed the Tarāsh-e Farhād to be the location of a planned inscription of Darius the Great ( 522–486 BC ) , King of Kings of the Persian Achaemenid Empire . Ernst Herzfeld also viewed it as an unfinished Achaemenid inscription , however they did not assign a specific date to it unlike Jackson . Erich Schmidt , M. Golzari and D. Huff later viewed the Tarāsh-e Farhād as a field prepared for an inscription with its date of creation being unknown .
According to local tradition , `` as reported in the 1960s '' and noted earlier by A. V. Williams Jackson , the Tarāsh-e Farhād is attributed to the legendary architect of Khosrow II named Farhad . Farhad features in Nizami Ganjavi 's famous tragic romance Khosrow and Shirin , which they started writing in c. 1180 . According to Nizami ( died 1209 ) , Farhad completed three monumental works : the creation of the milk channel , a passage cut through the mountain at Bisotun , and the portrait of princess Shirin . From the 15th to the 20th century , the story of Farhad and Shirin was a popular theme in various forms of visual art , including miniatures . A miniature of depicts Farhad and Shirin near the pool at Mount Behistun , while the hillside on the same artwork shows a large flat piece of stone with effigies of Farhad and Shirin . This slab `` is clearly identifiable '' as the Tarāsh-e Farhād . The Encyclopedia Iranica adds :
Another perspective of the context and creation of the Farhād Tarāsh was offered in the 1970s by architect W. Salzmann . Salzmann conducted examinations of the cliff and the rock face in order to reconstruct the original Sasanian plans ; according to their research , `` a huge terrace '' was planned to be built at 30 meters high and a massive ayvan ( Middle Persian : āywan ) was to be hollowed out of the rock . According to Salzmann , the scale of the ayvan was probably approaching the Taq-e Kasra at Ctesiphon , the Sasanian royal capital . They also noted that reliefs were going to be added on either side . The Encyclopedia Iranica notes that Salzmann 's hypothesis `` is consonant with earlier theories suggesting a palace '' , or a fire temple built against the cliff ; however , the Encyclopedia Iranica adds these theories are `` impossible to prove conclusively '' .
Stone blocks on the hillside
Right next on the hillside , there are several hundred dressed stone blocks . They were recorded by early European travelers who visited Iran , but they were not identified as being from the Sasanian era until Heinz Luschey managed to examine them . Luschey concluded that these stones were made of the same rock as the Farhād Tarāsh .

Pedals is the second studio album from post-hardcore band Rival Schools , released 10 years after their debut record United by Fate was first released .
Glassjaw and Head Automatica frontman Daryl Palumbo remixed the track `` Choose Your Adventure '' .
Background and production
Following the demise of Quicksand , frontman Walter Schreifels formed Rival Schools at the recommendation of their label Island Records . The band consisted of Schreifels , and hardcore punk veterans Sam Siegler on drums , Cache Tolman on bass ; guitarist Ian Love joined months later . The band released United by Fate in September 2001 , and promoted it through to mid-2002 . In December that same year , Love announced their departure from the group , choosing to focus on their side project Cardia . In early 2003 , Chris Traynor of Bush was announced as their new guitarist , and the band recorded their second album . Island Records subsequently shelved it , and the group broke up . Schreifels moved to Berlin , Germany , produced albums for Hot Water Music and CIV , formed Walking Concert , reunited their first band Gorilla Biscuits , and moved to Williamsburg , Brooklyn . Siegler joined Nightmare of You , and Traynor and Tolman formed Institute .
Rival Schools reformed in April 2008 , which Schreifels credited to the Gorilla Biscuits reunion : `` I longed for the togetherness that defines Rival Schools . '' They appeared at a variety of festivals and went on a UK tour . During a performance at Download Festival , they debuted four new songs . The band wrote some new material and made demos shortly after the reunion ; they wrote an additional five-or-six prior to entering a studio . On January 27 , 2009 , the band announced they had begun recording a new album , and eventually finished in late 2009 . The majority of the album was done at House of Love in Brooklyn , New York , with the band producing and Love handling recording . Additional recording was held at Studio G , with Joel Hamilton and assistance by Francisco Botero . Love mixed `` Wring It Out '' and `` The Ghost Is Out There '' , Chris Sheldon mixed `` 69 Guns '' , `` Eyes Wide Open '' and `` Shot After Shot '' , with the remainder being done by Hamilton . Will Quinnell mastered the recordings at Sterling Sound .
Composition
Pedal has been described as an emo , pop rock and post-hardcore release , utilizing less distortion and a lack of heavy sound that was prevalent on United by Fate . Schreifels said the writing was informed by the experiences the members had while in their various other bands between 2003 and 2008 . They focused more of their efforts on writing melodies and lyrics , returning to similar themes they had tackled previously . Schreifels ' grunge-esque vocals had developed into a raspy baritone . The title Pedals referred to the situations that lead up to the making of the album , as Schreifels explains : `` Sometimes we 're uphill . There 's a lot of movement and organization '' , in addition to using various effects pedals .
The opening track `` Wring It Out '' featured four different guitar parts , and a bassline that recalled the one in `` Travel by Telephone '' , the opening track from United by Fate . `` 69 Guns '' sees an arpeggio part ascending over melodic riffs and feedback . It uses acoustic guitars , as well as a piano during the bridge section . The title is a reference to the Alarm track `` 68 Guns '' . `` Eyes Wide Open '' channeled their debut 's brighter material , specially `` Used for Glue '' . `` Choose Your Adventure '' incorporates synthesizers and an organ ; it , alongside `` The Ghost Is Out There '' , channeled the heavy sound of Quicksand . The orchestral ballad `` Racing to Red Lights '' occasionally had sparse , slower instrumentation ; the intro to it was reminiscent of the Stratford 4 's The Revolt Against Tired Noises ( 2002 ) .
Following track `` Shot After Shot '' was a combination of hardcore punk and shoegaze ; it , along with `` Big Waves '' were new versions of tracks from their scrapped second album . The main guitar riff and verse music evolved from those sessions , while `` Big Waves '' retained its structure and arrangement . Both tracks were credited to the band and Traynor . `` Small Doses '' , a Smiths-indebted track , featured Schreifels crooning and shared a thematic similarity with `` Institutionalized '' by Suicidal Tendencies . They said it was about having a break from other people .
Release
The album was delayed due to the group being in discussions with various labels , such as Vagrant Records . In March 2010 , the band signed with Photo Finish Records , who had a distribution deal with major label Atlantic Records ; the new record was expected for release later in the year . Siegler , who acted as the band 's manager , said they were attracted to them due to their social-networking skills and that several of the people who worked with the band at Island Records during United by Fate now worked at Photo Finish . Following this , Schreifels embarked on a solo UK tour in March and April , leading up to the release of their solo album An Open Letter to the Scene in May . `` Shot After Shot '' premiered on BBC Radio 1 on September 30 . In October , the band played a few US shows with the Gaslight Anthem .
`` Shot After Shot '' was released as a single on November 14 , and was promoted with a one-off UK show two days later . On February 17 , 2011 , an outtake from the sessions , `` You Should Have Hung Out '' , was made available for streaming . On February 22 , `` Wring It Out '' premiered through Spinner . Pedals was made available for streaming on March 1 . The following day , a music video was released for `` Wring It Out '' , directed by Jordan Galland . It was influenced by an exorcist and features Jemima Kirke as a possessed girl . The track was released as a single on March 6 . Pedals was released on March 8 ; its artwork was a painting of poppies that was done by Alex Brown . The following month , the group went on a co-headlining UK tour with ... And You Will Know Us by the Trail of Dead . `` Wring It Out '' and `` Choose Your Adventure '' were released on a 7 '' vinyl single as part of Record Store Day .
An Ad-Rock remix of `` 69 Guns '' premiered through Spin on April 25 . It came about due to the friendship between Siegler and Ad-Rock . In May , the band went on a brief west coast tour . On August 5 , a music video was released for `` Eyes Wide Open '' , which featured references to Repulsion ( 1965 ) . A promotional CD featured `` Racing to Red Lights '' , a Daryl Palumbo ( of Glassjaw ) remix of `` Choose Your Adventure '' , and acoustic versions of `` Wring It Out '' and `` Small Doses '' . Later in the month , the band performed at Lollapalooza in the US , and at a one-off UK show . On September 28 , it was announced that Love had left the band a second time . In October , the group embarked on a headlining US tour with support from Balance and Composure and Hostage Calm . In June 2012 , the group appeared at the North by Northeast showcase . In September , the band played a few shows in Australia , with support from Toy Boats .

The Mishana tyrannulet ( Zimmerius villarejoi ) is a species of bird in the family Tyrannidae . It is endemic to two geographically separated regions in northeastern Peru . It is speculated that the two populations might represent separate species entirely .
Its natural habitat is subtropical or tropical moist lowland forests . It is threatened by habitat loss .
Its diet consists of insects and fruit , with some evidence suggesting that they consume seeds as well . It forages in the forest canopy for seeds as well as small arthropods .

Juscelino Kubitschek Bridge ( ) , commonly called Ponte JK ( ) , is a steel and concrete arch bridge across Lake Paranoá in Brasília , Brazil . It connects the eastern shore of the lake – where Lago Sul , Paranoá and Brasília International Airport are located – to Brasília 's city center , via the Monumental Axis . Opened to traffic on December 15 , 2002 , its distinctive silhouette quickly became a Brasília landmark .
The bridge is named after President Juscelino Kubitschek , who served from 1956 to 1961 , and is generally considered the main figure supporting the construction of the planned city of Brasília . It was designed by architect Alexandre Chan and structural engineer Mário Vila Verde .
Description
The bridge structure is long , wide and has two three-lane carriageways in each direction and walkways fitted with guard-rails on either for cyclists and pedestrians , each wide , and three spans . The main span structure has four supporting pillars standing on the Lake Paranoá lakebed ; and the deck weight is supported by three asymmetrical steel arches that crisscross diagonally . The decks are suspended by steel cables alternating at each side of the deck , interlacing in a twisted plane . The entire structure has a total length of , and was completed at a cost of US $ 56.8 million . The bridge has a pedestrian walkway and is accessible to pedestrians and bicyclists .
Awards
Alexandre Chan received the Gustav Lindenthal Medal for the bridge 's project at the 2003 International Bridge Conference in Pittsburgh . This medal is awarded `` for a single , recent outstanding achievement showing harmony with the environment , aesthetic merit and successful community participation '' .
The bridge was also awarded the 2003 Premio Abcem ( ABCEM Award ) for `` Best Steel Work of the Year , Bridges and Highway Overpasses Category '' , granted by the Brazilian Metal Construction Association ( Associação Brasileira da Construção Metálica , ABCEM ) .

Sayed Jalal ( full name Sayed Jalal Karim ; Persian : سید جلال ) was a candidate in the 2009 Afghanistan presidential election .
Early life
As a child in Kabul , Sayed Jalal was known in Afghanistan and abroad for their prodigious skills in mathematics . At the age of 9 , Jalal came to the United States where they interviewed with several top American colleges , including Columbia University . However , Jalal was not able to attend college in the U.S. , because Hafizullah Amin demanded their return to Afghanistan and then forced to them and their father to move to Russia . There , Jalal attended Moscow University where they were the youngest student ever , but they did not earn any degrees .
After leaving Russia , Jalal and their father took refuge in Pakistan before finally immigrating to Saudi Arabia .
Political background
Sayed Jalal has negotiated ceasefires and hostage releases
between The Northern Alliance , The Taliban , and Iran . They operate within a network of influence that once included Benazir Bhutto .
Jalal claims to campaign on a platform that rejects the notion that Afghan politics must be tribal and divisive . They claim to seek an end to warlord politics and is a strong critic of the government of Hamid Karzai , which they view as weak , incompetent , and corrupt . The current political atmosphere of Afghanistan combined with Jalal 's message of unity and hope has led some Afghans to compare them to Barack Obama .
A concern in the elections was that Jalal lacked political experience and international support . It was also suggested that Jalal does not know how to speak formal Persian by many Afghans within and outside Afghanistan .

Celia Sebiri ( 1913-2006 ) was an American jewelry designer active in the 1940s-1980s .
Biography
Sebiri was born 17 March 1913 , and studied at Hunter College . Them husband was a meat broker , and in the 1970s , they lived on Greenwich Square , Washington . They died on 1 April 2006 , aged 93 , in New York . Them daughter , Karen Sebiri , also became a jewelry designer .
Jewelry design
As a jewelry designer Sebiri was known particularly for their work in silver , which they treated as if it were more valuable than it already was . They also worked with natural materials including ivory and tortoiseshell , although the Endangered Species Act of 1973 led to Bonwit Teller having to take their work off sale after they and they realized that the hawksbill sea turtle was an endangered species . In 1974 Sebiri described their inspirations as coming from anywhere from passages of literature to dried up leaves .
In 1973 Sebiri won one of two Special Coty Awards for jewelry ( that year 's other jewelry Coty recipient was Michael Moraux of Dubaux ) for their work , which was described as sinuous and featuring animal motifs . In the 1980s they designed jewelry for Avon .

Iranian Russians are Russians living in Iran or Iranians of Russian descent . Russians populate various regions , but mostly in those regions which had been under direct Russian military occupation in the past , thus in Russia 's sphere of influence . This was an indirect result of the outcome of the last Russo-Persian Wars . Nowadays there are Russians located in the southern regions of the country as well ( such as Bushehr ) , where many of them work as technicians and nuclear experts , on for example the Bushehr Nuclear Power Plant .
Although the community has shrunk significantly since the Second World War , the following Iran crisis of 1946 and the Iranian Revolution , Russians are known to be living in Iran since the time of the Safavids .
History
Russians in Iran ( Persia ) have a long history dating back many centuries . However , the first mass-immigration of Russians into Iran occurred in the early 20th century when hundreds of thousands of White émigrés had to flee from the Bolsheviks . Most of them landed in the north Iranian provinces of Gilan and Mazandaran , but also in the northwest and northeast , in Iranian Azerbaijan and Khorasan , where communities of their descendants still live .
The Russian community kept increasing in the northern provinces of the country , as a result of the Russian sphere of influence which was established since the Russo-Persian War of 1826-28 . This influence ended some decades later with the crisis of 1946 .
Russia 's influence in northern Iran was paramount from the signing of the Anglo-Russian Convention of 1907 until the outbreak of World War I in 1914 . During this time period , it stationed troops in Iran 's Gilan , Azerbajian and Khorasan provinces , and its diplomatic offices ( consulates ) in these parts wieleded considerable power . These consulates dominated the local Iranian administration and in some circumstances even collected local taxes . Starting in the same year as the Anglo-Russian Convention , unpremeditated Russian colonization commenced in Mazandaran and Astarabad provinces . Then , in 1912 , Russian foreign policy officially adopted the plan to colonize northern Iran . At the outbreak of World War I , there were most likely some 4,000 Russian settlers in Astarabad and Mazandaran , whereas in northeastern Iran the Russians had founded a minimum of 15 Russian villages .
During the reign of Nicholas II of Russia , Russian occupational troops played a major role in the attempted Tsarist suppression of the Iranian Constitutional Revolution . In the dawn of the outbreak of World War I , Russian occupational forces occupied Qajar Iran 's Azerbaijan province as well as the entire north and north-east of the country , and amounted to circa twenty thousand . Following the start of the Persian Campaign of World War I , the number of Russian troops in Iran moderately grew to some eighty or ninety thousand .
In the 1920s-1930s , the Soviet secret service ( Cheka-OGPU-NKVD ) carried out clandestine operations on Iranian soil as it tried to eliminate White émigrées that had moved to Iran .
Russian Orthodoxy
The once numerous Russian Orthodox community in Iran has shrunken over the years . They are mostly the descendants of Russian émigrés and the permanently accredited staff of diplomatic and trade missions .
Tehran 's Orthodox Community traces its history to the late 16th century .
St. Nicholas Church , Tehran was built the 1940s on donations from Russian émigrés . It was designed by émigré architect and Iranian Army officer Nikolai Makarov . As soon as the crosses appeared on its cupolas , the half-finished church opened its doors to parishioners . There were several Orthodox priests in Tehran before the 1979 Islamic Revolution . In the early 1980s , all of them were expelled . It was not until the late 1990s that the St. Nicholas Church received its new head priest . Hieromonk Alexander Zarkeshev was appointed by the Moscow Patriarchate to serve in Tehran .

The stout whiting ( Sillago robusta ) , also known as the yellow-cheek whiting or school whiting , is a species of benthic marine fish in the smelt-whiting family Sillaginidae . Like other sillaginids , it is an elongated , slightly compressed fish , growing to a maximum known length of 30 cm . The stout whiting is endemic to Australia , with the species divided into western and eastern populations , with the western population ranging from Shark Bay to Fremantle and the eastern population from Bustard Head , Queensland to northern New South Wales . The species inhabits deep , sandy continental shelf regions to a depth of at least 70 m .
The stout whiting is a benthic carnivore , consuming a variety of polychaetes and crustaceans . The species grows rapidly , and sexual maturity is reached at a length of 13 cm , with spawning occurring between December and March . Juveniles of the eastern population move to protected inshore waters , while those of the western population remain offshore their entire life .
Stout whiting are the subject of a major export fishery operating out of southern Queensland and to a lesser extent New South Wales , with fishery authorities limiting the yearly catch to 1000 tonnes in Queensland . Most of the catch is exported frozen to a number of Asian countries , although small quantities are sold in Australia , with the net worth of the fishery values at around 3 million Australian dollars per year .
Taxonomy and naming
The stout whiting is one of 29 species in the genus Sillago , which is one of three divisions of the smelt whiting family Sillaginidae . The smelt-whitings are Perciformes in the suborder Percoidea .
The species was first scientifically described by Stead in 1908 based on a specimen collected from Rose Bay in Port Jackson , New South Wales , which was designated to be the holotype . After this description and naming , the species was once again described and named by William Ogilby in 1910 as Sillago auricomis , based on a specimen taken from near Hervey Bay in Queensland . This is considered to be junior synonym under ICZN naming rules and has subsequently been discarded . During a comprehensive revision of the sillaginids in 1985 , Roland McKay noted that the eastern and western populations of fish varied slightly in their fin osteology and swimbladder morphology , but recommended a full osteological comparison before placing them in subspecies ranks . McKay also postulates that the two populations became separated during the last ice age , when a land bridge closed the Torres Strait to the movement of the species .
The species is most commonly known as the 'stout whiting ' , and is recognised as such by the Australian Government . The species is occasionally called the 'yellow-cheek whiting ' and also 'school whiting ' , a broad name applied to a number of Australian sillaginids .
Description
The stout whiting is similar in appearance to a number of Australian sillaginids , with dorsal fin and swimbladder morphology the best identification features . It is a small fish , reaching a known maximum length of 30 cm , but more commonly seen below 23 cm . Like most sillaginids , the stout whiting has a slightly more convex dorsal profile compared to the ventral profile , reflecting the benthic nature of the species . The dorsal fin is composed of 2 sections ; the first consisting of 11 spines and the second of 1 spine followed by 16 to 18 soft rays . Large specimens show a distinct anterior keel on the first spine of the first dorsal fin , with this feature being more pronounced in the eastern population . The anal fin is similar to the second dorsal fin , having 2 spines followed by 16 or 19 soft rays . The lateral line has 65-70 scales , whilst the cheek has 2 to 3 rows of cteniod scales , and there are 33 vertebrae in total . The swimbladders of the two populations are slightly different , with the eastern population having small anterolateral extensions , while the western population lack these . There is a single tapering posterior extension and a duct like process which runs from the ventral surface to the urogenital opening .
In life , the stout whiting is a creamy yellow to sandy pink colour dorsally , with a silvery white with mauve reflections ventrally . The dorsal and ventral colours are sharply separated by a silvery mid lateral band that is often only weakly visible . The body and fins are devoid of any dark markings , with the only breaks in colouration being yellow blotches on the cheeks and a yellow blotch on the base of the first dorsal fin . The first dorsal fin has a white base , becoming darker dorsally , while the anal fin is white , becoming more yellow at the base of the fin . The caudal fin is a pale lemon yellow with a speckled margin , the pelvic fins are white to hyaline and the pectoral fins are hyaline . There have been records of geographical variation in colour amongst the species , especially within Shark Bay . The Shark Bay fish may have faint gold bars trending 50 degrees above the mid lateral silvery band , and may have black dusting on the dorsal and anal fins .
Distribution and habitat
Stout whiting are endemic to Australia , and consist of two apparently disjunct populations ; one on the eastern seaboard , the other on the western seaboard . The eastern population has a wider distribution , inhabiting waters from Bustard Head , Queensland to southern New South Wales . The western population exists from Shark Bay in the north to Fremantle in the south . In their 1985 revision of the Sillaginidae , McKay reported the species from as far north as the Gulf of Carpentaria , but did not mention any specimen from this far north in their follow-up catalogue for the FAO .
Stout whiting are found in deeper waters than other Australian sillaginids , inhabiting sandy substrates at depths of 10 to 70 m. juvenile fish of the eastern population inhabit shallower waters for the first year of life , often in large bays and near surf beaches . The fish of the western population spend their entire lives offshore . In northern Australia , the same offshore niche is occupied by the mud whiting , Sillago lutea . In southern Queensland , where it coexists in deeper waters with S. flindersi , the stout whiting shows preference for deep sandy strata with a riverine influence .
Biology
Due to the emergence of stout whiting as a major east coast fishery , a number of detailed studies have been undertaken to determine the reproductive and growth characteristics of the species in southern Queensland , while a series of studies in southern Western Australia have focused on the diet and movements of the species in relation to the ecology of coexisting sillaginids . Like most smelt-whitings , the stout whiting is a schooling species , occasionally associating with S. vitttata , S. burrus and S. bassensis in southern Western Australia and with S. flindersi in southern Queensland . The species is thought to form large schools mostly at dawn and dusk .
Diet and feeding
Stout whiting are benthic predators that forage the sea floor using their protrusile jaws to 'suck up ' prey from the substrate . Research conducted in southern Queensland indicates the species preys mostly on crustaceans and polychaete worms . Individuals less than 10 cm predominantly consume small crustaceans such as copepods and mysids , while older fish took more polychaetes . Amphipods and the shrimp genus Callianassa were also commonly taken in this study . In southern Queensland , there is also a strong temporal control on the diet , with summer months showing much higher polychaete intake compared to crustaceans and vice versa in winter . A detailed study in southern Western Australia indicated amphipods and polychaetes are the two primary components of this population 's diet . Penaeids , ostracods , ophiuroid echinoderms and a variety of molluscs also make up a significant part of the species diet in this area . Once again , larger fish took more polychaetes , and in general broadened their diet with increasing age . This resulted in a low dietary overlap with other coexisting sillaginids present in the same area .
The stout whiting is also a major prey species itself for a number of species , with seals , dolphins and larger fish known predators of the species .
Reproduction and growth
The stout whiting reaches sexual maturity by the end of its second year of life , with around 50 % of fish accomplishing this after only one year . The fish are around 13 cm once they reach sexual maturity .
The patterns of spawning and movement of the juveniles differs between the eastern and western populations . In the western population , unlike many co-occurring sillaginids , stout whiting do not move inshore to spawn and the juveniles do not make their way to shallower waters ; instead they spawn offshore , with the fish spending their entire lives in this environment . In contrast , the eastern population do use inshore nursery areas for the juveniles including bays and surf beaches , with this difference between populations attributed to increased competition between sillaginids by some authors . In both populations , spawning occurs over summer , with the fish spawning multiple times between December and March .
Stout whiting are fast growers in comparison to most other smelt-whitings , reaching 80 % of its final length after 2 years of life . The species is known to reach a maximum age of 7 years , although most individuals do not survive more than 3 years .
Relationship to humans
Stout whiting , like most of the smelt-whitings are considered to be good quality table fish , although you have soft flesh which results in a tendency to bruise easily . Due to their mostly offshore nature and small size , they are rarely targeted or caught by recreational fishermen , who take an estimated 1 tonne per year . They are however are a major target for commercial operators , especially in southern Queensland .
The Queensland fishery originated in 1981 , after a single operator began targeting eastern school whiting , S. flindersi . It was soon discovered that stout whiting were highly abundant in the surrounding region and the fishery began to shift towards the species . The original operator who realised the potential of the fishery continued after the market took a downfall , upgrading equipment with a new snap freezing facility , which became essential for exporting the fish . There was a rapid expansion in the fishery between 1989 and 1990 , with 10 operators recording a 1789 tonne haul in 1990 . In 1991 the market once again took a downfall due to low demand , and the fishery is now closely monitored by fishery authorities , with a 1000 tonne limit on the total yearly catch in place since 2000 . This limit includes the fish taken as bycatch in other fisheries such as prawn trawling , which means often a sizable amount must be discarded .
In New South Wales , stout whiting were mostly discarded by trawlers until an export market developed in the 1970s . Substantial amounts are taken and mostly discarded by prawn trawlers , and the catch has been stable at around 300-500 tonnes per year since 2000 . The western population is not highly exploited .
The fishery is worth a reported 3 million Australian dollars annually ( around $ 2.80 per kg in 1999 ) , with the fish exported to Thailand , China , Vietnam , Japan and Taiwan . These exported fish compete with local Asian sillaginids , especially northern whiting and Japanese whiting , resulting in substantial price fluctuations . Few fish make their way to local markets where they are sold as butterfly fillets .

Township and Village Enterprises ( TVEs , ) are market-oriented public enterprises under the purview of local governments based in townships and villages in China .
History
The State Council of the People 's Republic of China first officially used the term `` TVE '' in March , 1984 .
Previously `` Commune and Brigade Enterprises '' dating from the Great Leap Forward of 1958 to 1961 had served the rural areas . During that time TVEs had a limited role and were restricted to the production of iron , steel , cement , chemical fertilizer , hydroelectric power , and farm tools .
Most TVEs emerged during the Reform period in the 1980s ( Huang , 2008 ) . Though there were 12 million TVEs by 1985 , there were only 1.5 million in 1978 , at the start of the Reform period . As Huang summarizes : `` Clearly , the vast majority of TVEs had nothing to do with the Great Leap Forward . ''
Government reform
The reforms of 1978 changed TVEs , which became the most vibrant part of the Chinese economy as they experienced significant expansion in the 1980s and early 1990s . TVE employment grew from 28 million in 1978 to a peak of 135 million in 1996 . Likewise , production of TVEs increased to 1.8 trillion yuan in 1992 from 49 billion yuan in 1978 . More than half of TVE production in the 1980s occurred in Guangdong , Fujian , Zhejiang , Jiangsu , and Shandong provinces , all of which border the Pacific Ocean . In Jiangsu and Shandong TVEs employed some 30 percent of the rural workforce .
Notable characteristics
TVEs referred to the location of the enterprises , as opposed to the ownership structure . That is , TVE never referred to only companies owned by township and villages ; rather , TVE refers to companies located in townships and villages . Huang ( 2008 ) quotes a Chinese Ministry of Agriculture document from 1984 in support of this : TVEs include enterprises sponsored by townships and villages , the alliance enterprises [ private stock companies ] formed by peasants , other alliance enterprises , and individual enterprises . ''
Some collective TVEs were notable for their unique ownership and corporate governance setup .
Many of these firms were “ collectively owned ” in the sense that theoretical ownership rested with the collectives , either as a legacy of earlier sponsorship , or because township and village governments took the lead in establishing new TVEs after the breakup of the agricultural collectives . Ultimate “ ownership rights ” stayed with the collective , while “ use rights ” were delegated to managers in collective TVEs . The complexity of this arrangement led to the labeling of collective ( township and village ) TVE property rights as “ fuzzy. ” This lack of a true system of property rights collapsed in a short amount of time , as townships and villages expropriated the use rights using their ownership rights .
TVEs were very flexible in terms of organizational and ownership structure . While some were run by local governments , others were more genuinely independent in nature . Wong has shown that through the 1980s most of the supposedly collective TVEs operated as private enterprises in practice . In this sense , the use of the term collective masked the privatization of rural enterprise at a time when it was ideologically subversive to some .
TVEs thrived from 1978 to 1989 , and were largely dismantled between 1989 and 1996 . Scholars have given a number of reasons for their success . The political institutional environment favored these “ public ” enterprises during the early years of reform , since private businesses faced severe restrictions and discrimination in terms of resources and regulations . Also , the fiscal decentralization of the early 1980s gave greater decision-making power to local governments and linked fiscal revenue to the career potential of local officials , creating strong incentives for them to promote these enterprises . The TVEs moved in to take advantage of the gaps left in the market by the State-Owned Enterprises to produce colorful elastic bands , ID cardholders , etc . The TVEs benefited from first mover advantage as there was no competition in the early stages from private firms due to restrictions on the markets.The pent-up demand in China for a host of products provided ample profit-making opportunities for enterprises operating at this early juncture . Moreover , TVEs were helped by massive loans from the state banking system .
The TVE sector experienced dramatic changes in 1995-1996 ( Huang , 2008 ) . Official hostility toward Chinese entrepreneurship during the period of Jiang Zemin 's administration caused many to go out of business , with some estimates suggesting that about 30 percent have gone bankrupt . In addition , there has been a massive trend toward privatization . After the mid-1990s , TVEs were forced to restructure substantially . With increased market integration and competition , official discrimination against TVEs , and official preference for foreign-owned enterprises , TVEs lost their competitive position .
Further , the end of directional liberalism in China encouraged local officials to expropriate the TVEs . As competition intensified and credit became harder to obtain , the collectively owned TVE sector grew in comparison to the privately owned TVEs . Rural industries today are more tied to their local government and community and have taken on new forms and roles ( Huang , 2008 ) . One of the most striking developments has been the rise of “ industrial clusters ” of small firms both competing with one another and cooperating to form a relatively complete industrial chain . Industrial clusters have also emerged in places such as Brazil and Italy .

Universalism , in human geography , signals the position that ideas of development produced in Western social sciences hold for all times and places . Universalist thinking began in the Age of Enlightenment when philosophers decided on `` truths '' that could explain occurrences rationally and accurately . Development geography , human geography and other disciplines seek to find and critique universal `` truths '' . Critics suggest that Universalism has created a world knowledge hierarchy placing Western Europe , North America and the rest of the `` developed '' world at the top , as the centre of knowledge , and placing the rest of the globe below , as ignorant and needing to be educated . The hierarchy reiterates the core-periphery notion , examining it in terms of knowledge differentials across space .
Origins
As intellectuals began to question traditional understandings of the world and think on a global scale , new `` truths '' were created to help explain the world as placeless , free of cultural specificity , abstract and apolitical . They began to manifest themselves in development policies , political apparatuses , and other institutions . In the late 19th and 20th century , Émile Durkheim wrote that `` the truths of [ modern ] science are independent of any local context '' , echoing the Enlightenment 's philosophies and assuming an isotropic globe , thus allowing homogeneity to overtake difference . A sense of security and superiority was wielded as the world was now understood , which allowed for the continued teaching of and reliance upon universal `` truths '' .
One can see how saying that all knowledge is geographically located is widely taken as a way of saying that the knowledge in question is not authentically true at all .
Global diffusion
As universal `` truth '' claims gained acceptance among Western intellectuals , they began an important transition into the school system . Michel Foucault describes the 17th- and-18th century school systems as being important because of highly complex systems of conditioning . As `` truth '' claims were taught to children , they became embedded within societal and political apparatuses . Once cemented within such institutions , they were able to flourish and remain .
Through the imperialist expansion by the west and the successive colonisation around the globe , supposed universal `` truths '' began to diffuse across borders , space and place . Once colonies were set up and dominant hegemons were in place the processes of the west began to be the processes of the world and the necessary steps to modernisation .
Changing truths
The realization that the truths may not be universal across different spaces was an important factor in the 1970s , when questions arose of nationally varying styles of science . By the mid-1980s , geographical sensibility towards science increased , seeking to show that locality and spatial situation needed to be remembered to understand how scientific knowledge was made , became credible and flowed globally . It has been with that new situational approach to knowledge formation that allowed geographers to begin analyses of epistemology with relation to place and confront `` truth '' formation with a more culturally ecological ( cultural ecology ) approach .
Foucaulta truths
Important to universalism in geography is understanding how knowledge becomes accepted as truth . Foucault discusses truth in terms of `` societal regimes of truth '' and explains that truths are made up by societies by selecting `` the types of discourse which it accepts and makes function as true '' and creating and controlling `` the mechanisms that enable us to distinguish between true and false statements '' . They go on about the relationship between truth and systems of power and how they produce and maintain such regimes of truth .

Agostino Di Bartolomei ( 8 April 1955 in Rome – 30 May 1994 in San Marco di Castellabate ) was an Italian football player , who played as a midfielder or as a defender , in a sweeper role . Famed for their elegance on the ball and playmaking skills , they are regarded as one of A.S. Roma 's greatest players ever , and one of the greatest Italian players never to have been capped by the Italian national team .
Career
Di Bartolomei was born in a suburb of Rome . They started as a football player in the Garbatella and was recruited in the A.S. Roma junior team at fourteen . They were soon asked to play in the main team , making their debut in the Italian Serie A during the 1972–73 season .
In 1975 , they went on loan to Lanerossi Vicenza in Serie B to 'build up their bones ' ( Bruno Conti another future Roma star , was dispatched to Genoa for the same reason ) , returning to Rome in 1976 as one of the leading and indispensable players of the team .
After Nils Liedholm 's return as coach of A.S. Roma , Di Bartolomei became the team 's undisputed leader , raising to the title of captain and becoming a fan favourite . When they played , it was common to hear the Roma fans sing the chant `` Oh , Agostino ... Ago , Ago , Ago , Agostino gol ! ''
Despite their goalscoring prowess , Roma had several superb playmakers , in Di Bartolomei , compatriot Bruno Conti , and the Brazilians Falcão and Toninho Cerezo . Thus , Liedholm decided to move Di Bartolomei in front of the defence for protection , knocking precise passes up the field , with Falcão and Ceerezo played in the centre , while Conti would assume a more attacking role behind the forwards . During their time at Roma , they won the Coppa Italia three times , and a memorable scudetto in 1983 . The following season , marked by the penalty shootout defeat in the 1984 European Cup final held in Rome against Liverpool F.C. , was their last season with A.S. Roma ; although Di Bartolomei was able to net Roma 's first spot kick , later misses by Bruno Conti and Francesco Graziani ultimately proved to be decisive .
After leaving Roma , they were transferred to A.C. Milan that was undergoing a rebuilding process after a disastrous period in which they were relegated to the Serie B twice . After three seasons they left Milan and their career fizzled out after playing for Cesena and Salernitana . They finally retired in 1990 .
Style of play
A tactically intelligent and versatile team player , Di Bartolomei usually played as a central or defensive midfielder in front of the defensive line in a deep-lying playmaking role ; they were also capable of playing in a more advanced role , or in the centre of their team 's defensive line , where they usually functioned as a sweeper , a position in which they were frequently deployed during Roma 's Scudetto victory in the 1982–83 season , due to their ability to play the ball out from the back or advance into midfield with their head up while in possession of the ball . A quick and hard-working midfielder , although they were not gifted with significant pace , they were known for their stamina and long stride , which enabled them to cover the pitch effectively . Famed for their elegance on the ball , technical ability , and playmaking skills , they were known for their excellent long-passing ability , vision , and ability to read the game , and also possessed an eye for goal , due to their accurate and powerful shot from distance with their right foot ; they were also an accurate free-kick and penalty taker , and usually struck the ball without taking a run-up . In addition to their playing ability , they were also known for their outstanding tenacity and charismatic leadership as Roma 's captain , both on and off the pitch , in spite of their introverted character . They were also regarded as a serious , composed , and correct player , who was known for their fair play , honesty , and discipline as a footballer . Throughout their career , they were given the nickname Diba .
Retirement and death
Di Bartolomei suffered from clinical depression in their later years , and committed suicide by shooting themselves in their villa in San Marco di Castellabate , on 30 May 1994 , ten years to the day after Roma had lost the European Cup final to Liverpool on penalties .
They are a member of the A.S. Roma Hall of Fame .

A short story collection is a book of short stories and/or novellas by a single author . A short story collection is distinguished from an anthology of fiction , which would contain work by several authors ( e.g. , Les Soirées de Médan ) . The stories in a collection may or may not share a tone , theme , setting , or characters with one another .
Composition of a collection
Short story collections are made up of smaller texts—the individual short stories—in order to form a superior whole . In spite of this , each short story does not lose any of its meaning or narrative independence by being included in a collection . This does not mean that short stories do not gain any new meaning from being included in a collection , though . Because each story 's context has changed , surrounded by other stories with their own meanings and tones , the meaning and tone of any individual story might also be affected . In addition to the individual stories , short story collections may also include notes by the author .
The act of writing short stories is different from the act of gathering short stories into a collection . For instance , the short story author may or may not be the one who compiles the short story collection , even though the author penned the individual stories . This is especially obvious in the case of posthumous publications .
Note that short story collections should be considered different from traditional novels and other narratives because collections do not forward a cohesive storyline in the same way novels do . Instead , short story collections group individual pieces , each with their own narratives . If a short story collection as a whole has its own narrative , it is considered a short story cycle .
History of short story collections
Short story collections have their roots in medieval frame tale collections , growing into the postmodern narratives of the 1900s . Short story collections either can be authored traditionally by one person or evolve from oral , anonymous traditions that are finally penned by someone . An example of the latter would be Grimm 's Fairy Tales . Short story collections can be published when the author is alive or they can be collected and published after the author is dead using the author 's existing works .
Early Western short story collections include Marie of France 's Lais and Giovanni Boccaccio 's Decameron .
Uses for short story collections
From the producer side , short story collections are helpful economically to authors looking to publish . Because short stories are often less than fifty pages , putting them together can provide something that is more like the size of a novel . While short story collections are less popular than novels for consumers , they are purchased consistently . Short story collections have experienced a gradual increase in sales over the last decade , although most collections are not reprinted and do not sell more than 3,000 copies .
Aside from their entertainment value , short story collections can also be used for teaching . There are several potential applications for collections in the classroom . The first is the ability for students to quickly experience other cultures and traditions through a literary lens . Secondly , providing short story collections centered around a specific time creates an opportunity to encourage interest in historical studies . Teachers can also use short story collections as introduction or further exploration to a genre . By providing several works from that genre , students can get a feel of its conventions . Another potential use is to challenge students to evaluate and criticize literature by using short story collections as a jumping off point . The last idea is to use short story collections as a model for student writing since classical greats can be daunting or impossible for a student to replicate . However , newer , more bite-sized short story collections might be a good way for students to get the depth of exposure they need while not overwhelming them .
Notable short story collections
Short story collections can be divided into two general groups . The first is themed collections , which might share a character , setting , theme , or tone . This is different from a short story cycle in that the collection does not advance a cohesive narrative . The second is non-themed collections , a grouping in which each story has little literary similarity to the others . Following are notable collections from each group .
Themed collections
Grimms ' Fairy Tales by Jakob and Wilhelm Grimm
Dubliners by James Joyce
Them Body and Other Parties by Carmen Maria Machado
The Moons of Jupiter by Alice Munro
Nine Stories by J.D . Salinger

Ignacio de Iriarte ( 1620–1685 ) was a Spanish painter .
Iriarte was born in Azcoitia , Guipuzcoa . They received their early education at home , but in 1642 went to Seville , and entered the studio of Francisco Herrera the Elder . Here they learned to understand colouring , but they were never able to draw the human figure with spirit or accuracy , and therefore determined to devote their attention exclusively to landscape , and was the one Spanish artist who walked that rarely trodden path , and obtained in it the greatest possible celebrity .
In 1646 we hear of them as residing at Aracena , near to the mountains , and there it was that they married Doña Francisca de Chaves , but their first wife lived a very short time , and in 1649 they returned to Seville , where they married their second wife Doña Maria Escobar . They were an original member of the Academy of Seville , its first secretary in 1660 , and again secretary from 1667 to 1669 . For very many years , they were the intimate friend and associate of Bartolomé Esteban Murillo , who highly praised their landscapes , and on many occasions the two artists worked together , Murillo executing the figures , and Iriarte the landscape .
As a result of a dispute with reference to a series of pictures on the life of David , they stopped collaborating .
Murillo painted the whole of the picture representing an episode in the life of David , and Iriarte contented themselves with their exquisite landscapes , as a rule wild and rugged scenes , somewhat allied to those of Salvator Rosa , in which at that time they were the greatest exponent . There is a landscape preserved at Madrid in an unfinished condition , with the figures merely sketched in by Murillo and the background left incomplete by Iriarte , and this is said to have been left incomplete at the time of the quarrel . The painter has been called the Spanish Claude Lorraine , and Murillo declared that their best landscapes were painted `` by Divine inspiration '' , but the comparison and statement are not accurate , as there is a forced character and an imaginary romance about Iriarte 's landscapes with an extraordinary lack of atmosphere . They are , however , pleasing and attractive , although rare .
Iriarte died in Seville . Their works are to be found principally in Madrid , but can also be studied in the galleries of St. Petersburg and the Louvre .

Oil Strike North is a BBC television drama series produced in 1975 .
The series was created and produced by Gerard Glaister and dealt with life on Nelson One , a North Sea oil rig owned by the fictional company Triumph Oil . Eschewing the corporate power struggles of Mogul / The Troubleshooters and concentrating on more personal storylines , Oil Strike North was essentially a character study of how workers faced life on the rig and the impact it had on the lives of their families and loved ones .
Oil Strike North lasted for one series of thirteen episodes . Gerard Glaister later moved on to produce the Second World War resistance drama Secret Army , the air freight series Buccaneer and then onto the boating soap serial Howards ' Way . Two of the leading actors in Oil Strike North , Nigel Davenport and Glyn Owen , also later appeared in Howards ' Way .
The scenario was later revived by the BBC for the mid-1990s drama Roughnecks .

are a Japanese noise music group formed in 1981 . Initially a solo project of Toshiji Mikawa , Fumio Kosakai joined upon the project 's relocation to Tokyo . The duo 's stated aim is to produce `` pure '' noise , uninfluenced by musical ideas or even human intention , using primarily feedback , vocals , and various electronics . Kosakai calls this sound `` hard noise '' , as a nod to the jazz subgenre hard bop .
History
In 1981 , Toshiji Mikawa formed Incapacitants in Osaka as a solo project from their other creative endeavours with improv noise group Hijokaidan . As a solo project , Mikawa collaborated with Japanese vocalist and visual artist Yamantaka Eye , among others . After relocating to Tokyo , Kosakai , of Japanese noise band C.C.C.C. , joined Incapacitants to form the current duo . Kosakai would later join Mikawa and become a regular member of Hijokaidan .
Incapacitants , alongside Hijokaidan , Merzbow , C.C.C.C. , Solmania , Hanatarash , the Gerogerigegege , and Masonna , are counted among the more well-known Japanese noise bands formed in the 1980s .
In November 1999 , Incapacitants performed their first international concert at Music Unlimited Festival '99 in Wels , Austria .
Many of the group 's track titles reference their professions , but because of Mikawa and Kosakai 's day jobs as bank employee and government office worker , respectively , the duo have not been able to tour abroad often .
The group also recorded sessions with Vivian Slaughter of Gallhammer .

The Caproni Ca.61 was an Italian heavy day bomber aircraft of 1922 . It was the final development of the Caproni three engines , twin boom biplane types developed during World War I , but it was not put into production .
Development
The Caproni Ca.61 and Ca.61a were the final evolution of the Caproni Ca.1 bomber of 1914 . The Ca.61 retained the twin boom biplane layout , the three engines in push-pull configuration and the approximate dimensions of the 1916 Ca.36 , the main Ca.3 type production variant , but had more modern , streamlined structures and balanced rudders .
In May 1923 a contemporary report described it as the `` Caproni type 1922-3 '' , suggesting the design work and construction started in 1922 . The completion date is unclear , not least because even as the original design , the Ca.61 , was under construction the benefit of some modifications was recognised . It is uncertain if the Ca.61 was completed or if the airframe was modified into the Ca.61a before the first flight . The main differences between the Ca.61a and the Ca.61 included a smaller interplane gap , the addition of dihedral to the outer wings , aerodynamic alterations to the ailerons and structural simplifications to the inner wing bracing . There were also modifications to the fuselage to improve the gunner 's position in the nose .
Design
The wings of the Ca.61 were rectangular in plan and had , ailerons apart , the same span and similar chords , though the lower wing was 9 % narrower . Both wings were built around pairs of spars . The wings were divided into three sections , a central cell defined by the two booms and two outer sections which could be easily demounted , like those of the Ca.36 . In both the inner and outer sections , the wings were braced together by parallel pairs of interplane struts between the spars , with two nearly vertical pairs on each side on the outer wings . In addition , pairs of diagonal struts ran from the feet of the inner vertical struts to the junction of the inner and outer sections over the booms , meeting another pair from the upper fuselage . Two more pairs of struts from this point to the wing centre formed a cabane . Only the outer wing sections carried dihedral . There were ailerons on both upper and lower wings but only the upper pair were aerodynamically balanced by extensions beyond the wingtips .
The two deep , oval section tailbooms , with the outer engines at their forward ends on the lower wing , were joined to the upper wing via the oblique interplane struts . The booms ran aft to carry the empennage . The Ca.61 's biplane horizontal tail , with constant chord tailplanes and elevators mounted between the fins , formed a stiffening structural box-unit . The balanced rudders were broad and tall .
The three-man crew of the Ca.61a were in open cockpits well forward of the wing in a central , short fuselage . There was a compartment for a defensive gunner , equipped with a flexible gun mount , in the nose and behind them a separate cockpit with side-by-side seating for pilot and co-pilot , fitted with dual control . Bombs were carried on the fuselage underside and the third engine was mounted in pusher configuration at its rear .
Two different engines were proposed for the Ca.61a , Isotta Fraschini V.6s or SPA 6As , both six-cylinder upright water-cooled inline engines . From the powers quoted for the Ca.61 and the Ca.61a earlier design had Isotta Fraschinis and the later one SPAs .
The Ca.61a had a conventional , fixed undercarriage with double-tyred mainwheels under the outer engines . Each wheel was hinged on a V-strut from the fuselage side and a narrow V drag strut from the aft spar to the stub axle ends . A vertical , shock-absorbing strut joined the axle to the forward spar . There were tailskids at the ends of the booms and a large nosewheel , half-buried in the fuselage below the gunner , in case of nose-overs .
The Ca.61 satisfied Caproni 's testing programme but the government placed no production orders .

CAMPATH-1 antigen , also known as cluster of differentiation 52 ( CD52 ) , is a glycoprotein that in humans is encoded by the CD52 gene .
CD52 is present on the surface of mature lymphocytes , but not on the stem cells from which these lymphocytes were derived . It also is found on monocytes and dendritic cells . Further , it is found within the male genital tract and is present on the surface of mature sperm cells .
CD52 is a peptide of 12 amino acids , anchored to glycosylphosphatidylinositol ( GPI ) . Since it is highly negatively charged and present on sperm cells and lymphocytes , it has been conjectured that its function is anti-adhesion , allowing cells to freely move around .
CD52 binds the ITIM ( immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif ) -bearing sialic acid-binding lectin SIGLEC10 .
Clinical significance
It is associated with certain types of lymphoma .
It is the protein targeted by alemtuzumab , a monoclonal antibody used for the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia . A phase III trial into treatment of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis showed a reduction in relapse rate , but no statistically significant reduction in accumulated disability , when used as a first-line therapy . However , a sister study looking at patients in whom relapses had occurred despite treatment with interferon beta or glatiramer demonstrated reduction in both relapse rate and accumulated disability . 20 % patients randomised to interferon beta 1a had `` sustained accumulation of disability '' compared with 13 % in the alemtuzumab group .

Born Rich is a 2003 documentary film about the experience of growing up in wealthy families . It was created by Jamie Johnson , an heir to the Johnson & Johnson fortune , and filmed primarily between 1999 and 2001 . The film consists primarily of Johnson interviewing 10 other young heirs . These interviews are offset by Johnson 's exploration of their own experience and family as they come into a large inheritance on their 21st birthday . They seek out how to be a productive person , avoiding the dysfunction that they see affecting many of the very rich . The film explores the taboo the ultra rich have against talking about their wealth . Johnson believes this secrecy about wealth causes the wealthy to be dysfunctional , and exists because the discussion of their wealth challenges the notion that America is a meritocracy and their right to have their wealth .

Production
Development and pre-production
Made over a three-year period while they were a history student at NYU , the documentary started out as their graduation thesis . At the age of 20 , Johnson came up with the idea for the film through conversations with their uncle , Dirk Wittenborn , a novelist and screenwriter , who is also a producer of the film . Having been brought up reading Scott Fitzgerald , Johnson noted that no one of their class or background had attempted to examine issues of social class in America today . They were also personally motivated to make this film by their approaching inheritance on their 21st birthday , having observed that a lot of people with inherited wealth , including members of their family , “ live unproductive lives , and even in some cases tragic and miserable lives. ” They wanted to figure out why this occurs to avoid that fate . The film makes reference to their grandfather , Seward Johnson , noting the conflicts from their third , late in life marriage to their chambermaid , and the longest , most expensive contested will trial in U.S. history that ensued after their death in 1983 . During the trial there were ongoing headlines in The New York Times about the estate battle and lurid tales were revealed that humiliated their family . Johnson said , “ My grandfather made some serious mistakes , they were born rich and I really did n't want to be in the same situation that they found themselves in at the end of their life . ”
It took three years to make as most of the young heirs contacted to participate in the film turned them down , sometimes harshly , due to parental objection , fear of losing their inheritance , or fear of violating social taboo . A Campbell 's soup heir and a Rockefeller initially agreed to participate but both of them backed out due to a parent 's objections . The pre-production took two years and involved hundreds of phone calls to line up the `` young inheritors '' . Johnson enlisted Bingo Gubelmann , a childhood friend who is a cousin of socialite Marjorie Gubelmann , to be a co-producer and to help recruit `` inheritors '' in their late teens to mid-20s who could live lavishly without ever having to work . 11 heirs ended up being interviewed .
Filming
By summer of 2000 , after a year of filming , most of those interviewed were asking Johnson to take them out of the movie . Carlo von Zeitschel threatened a lawsuit but never filed . Johnson recalls people approaching them at parties telling them that they were a traitor to their class , that making the documentary was the `` stupidest thing '' they could do , it would not benefit anyone , and they would regret it and lose all their friends . When they were no longer able to get permission to film at parties , Johnson and Bingo had a `` Roaring Twenties '' themed joint 21st-birthday party for themselves at the East Hampton house of Johnson 's parents . A sign posted at the entrance informed the guests they would be filmed for a documentary . They were worried that no one would come to the party because of their unpopularity with the rich due to the film , but four film subjects and 150 other guests attended . The movie ends at the party with Johnson 's voice-over about living outside the American dream that was achieved by their great-grandfather . According to Johnson , the decadence of the party was intentional . They had always wanted to film the final scene , where they and Bingo pour Veuve Clicquot into a tower of champagne glasses , `` as part of the movie about the unequal distribution of wealth in America . ''
Post-production
The editing process took over a year , with 45 hours of footage to edit . While the film was being edited , Wittenborn wrote an article about the film that appeared in the September 2002 issue of W magazine . After hearing early reports about the film , Luke Weil filed a lawsuit on September 4 , 2002 , demanding that their scenes be removed . The lawsuit was featured in the film . Other film subjects were also apprehensive when the press started reporting about the movie .
Weil alleged in the lawsuit that they had been `` tricked '' into participating in what they thought would solely be a school project . Witternborn recalls that when they were questioned by Weil during the filming , they told Weil about their work in film and television , and that they hoped to sell the film to HBO . Johnson recalls Weil constantly vacillated during the making of the movie between being the most enthusiastic film participant , who expressed their ideas for film scenes , to being nervous about the criticism from their friends regarding their participation . Other film subjects also had regrets about participating and some also claimed they were told that it was a student film and thought it would never be seen by a large audience . Johnson denied any deception , saying they all signed releases that were fully explained to them . In a decision dated September 27 , 2002 , the New York Supreme Court dismissed Weil 's lawsuit , ruling that the subject matter of the film was newsworthy , and that the releases Weil had signed in 2000 clearly identified the film as a commercial production .
The film had been submitted to the Sundance Film Festival when the court ruling was reported by the press in October 2002 . Changes were apparently made to the film after Weil became incensed after the film 's debut at Sundance . Wittenborn remarked on Weil 's reaction to the film , `` We could have made them [ Weil ] look worse . We were being kind . '' Johnson concurred that there was `` some reservation on our part in terms of editing '' . Johnson thought that Weil was `` the most honest person in the film '' , who was `` willing to say things ... that may reflect what our peers are thinking all the time . ''
Release
Born Rich was selected for a noncompetition screening at the 2003 Sundance Film Festival , where it was a hit . The film premiered at Sundance on January 19 , 2003 in the American Spectrum category . Every seat at the screening was occupied and a couple dozen people were turned away . Sheila Nevins , executive vice president for original programming at HBO , decided to see the film at Sundance when they saw a line around the block for it . An edited version of the film was produced after it was acquired by HBO . In July 2003 , it was promoted at the HBO presentation at the Television Critics Association convention in Los Angeles by Johnson and three film subjects .
Johnson was on The Oprah Winfrey Show to discuss Born Rich in a namesake episode that also featured Paris Hilton and Nicky Hilton , two days before HBO 's big screen premiere of the film in New York City on October 15 , 2003 . Five heirs from the film attended the premiere with Johnson . According to Johnson , although Georgina Bloomberg did not attend the opening , they sent them a note afterwards saying they were happy with the film 's success and the wide audiences that were able to see it . A week before the premiere , some of Georgina 's remarks in the film were reported in a New York Daily News article that included a response from a spokesperson for their father , the then mayor of New York . There were sold-out screenings of the film in New York for weeks . Johnson appeared with S.I . Newhouse IV on Paula Zahn Now on CNN to discuss the film the day before its October 24 , 2003 premiere at the Hamptons International Film Festival .
Johnson was also interviewed about the film on CNN Sunday Morning the day before the film 's television debut and on NPR 's All Things Considered on the day of the television debut on HBO on October 27 , 2003 . The film was broadcast as part of the HBO 's America Undercover series , where it was on a regular rotation . Johnson noted that some film subjects were very supportive of the film and happy about what they said on camera , while other subjects were anxious about the film due to the criticism from friends and family for violating the code of secrecy about wealth . Johnson felt this secrecy about wealth arises from fear of contradicting the belief that their society is a meritocracy , and enables the wealthy to avoid having to justify the power and privilege bestowed by their wealth .
Born Rich was the first of several television shows about the wealthy that fall season . A number of shows on the rich had started airing or were in production . Born Rich was considered more substantive viewing . Johnson believed that the television networks were influenced by the amount of press the film received , as it went to Sundance right before the networks started to develop and market shows for next two television seasons . They also believed the fascination with wealth in popular culture at the time of the release `` is deeply influenced by the administration that 's running the country . '' In 2004 , Johnson and Cody Franchetti were interviewed about the film on Australia 's Channel 9 news show 60 Minutes .
In an Avenue Magazine interview about the film ten years after its release , Johnson said , `` Now , reality television about wealth is a staple genre on TV , whereas there was n't a single show about that at the time ... so it had more of an impact and people were n't as guarded . '' In 2013 , Born Rich was alluded to on MSNBC 's All In with Chris Hayes where Johnson commented on meritocracy in America on the day Prince George of Wales was born . Born Rich was also broadcast in 2013 on Australia 's public television channel ABC2 . ABC2 published an update from Johnson where they said that privacy around wealth has recently begun to ease , and that they remain close to at least half of the film 's subjects and friendly with all of them . They also noted that now as economies are more globalized , they see the film as an early step in the growing fascination with family wealth as great fortunes continue to grow in developing economies e.g . the influx of wealthy families into Australia with the expansion of the Chinese economy .
Accolades
The documentary was nominated for two Emmy Awards in 2004 : Outstanding Directing for Nonfiction Programming for Jamie Johnson ; and Outstanding Nonfiction Special for Sheila Nevins ( executive producer ) , Dirk Wittenborn ( produced by ) , and Jamie Johnson ( producer ) .

The Ganap Party was a Filipino political party that grew from the Sakdalista movement . Benigno Ramos , who served as its leader , was also the founder of the Sakdalista movement . The party took its name from the Tagalog word , which means `` complete '' .
Inception
Sakdal party leader Benigno Ramos returned to the Philippines in 1938 , after three years in self-imposed Japanese exile . Anxious to regroup after the failed May uprising , they formed Ganap . It was therefore not surprising that the party was pro-Japan in outlook and saw an alliance with them as the road to independence . Ramos named the party Ganap because they were anxious to kickstart their election campaign . Their propaganda was so rabidly pro-Japanese and anti-American that Ramos was imprisoned on charges of swindling .
Ganap drew its support base from the old Sakdal members , the disgruntled peasant class .
The party was not without internal dissent , though , as opponents of Benigno Ramos remained in the old Sakdal Party , claiming that Ramos had become a Nacionalista turncoat and a puppet of Quezon .
The coming of Japan
Ganap was able to organise and they were one of only three parties allowed to stand in the 1941 election , when Manuel L. Quezon sought re-election . The party 's main area of support was the Bulacan-Southern Luzon area , where the major land estates were located . As the party gained strength , membership spread to other provinces , such as La Union and Pangasinan .
The Pacific theater of the World War II was opened on December 8 , 1941 ( Philippine time ) , with the bombing of Pearl Harbor . After that mission , Japanese planes proceeded to bomb targets in Davao . By Christmas , the Japanese forces had landed on Philippine soil . Among the invaders was the pro-Japanese Katipunan general Artemio Ricarte . In early April 1942 , the Japanese liberated Ramos from their imprisonment , without forgetting to mobilize Ganap support for the Japanese .
Role in the Japanese occupation
Ganap saw the Japanese as saviors of the Philippines , and its members readily collaborated with them during the occupation of the islands . Many Ganap members were recruited into the Yoin , or United Nippon , an organisation dedicated to performing auxiliary and menial duties for the Japanese expeditionary force .
Other Ganap members were absorbed by the Japanese Army , and were issued weapons . Widespread abuse of these duties and powers was reported , and guerrilla outfits retaliated by harassing Ganap members and their families . In return , the Ganap members would begin sending `` Intelligence scouts '' into the enemy guerrilla units and their families . If proven that they were anti-Japanese or have killed a fellow Ganap member , these outfits would be rooted out and assassinated .
The Nacionalista Party clique , led by then-President José P. Laurel and former Philippine Executive Commission Chairman Jorge B. Vargas , became worried over the growing power of the Ganap Party . Ganap was therefore sidelined when the occupiers decreed the creation of KALIBAPI into which they were merged . Although the party was a constituent of KALIBAPI , Ganap never exercised real influence within the new grouping , partly at the suggestion of Laurel and Vargas . Many of the original party followers would go on to form the basis of the militia group Makapili , which the Japanese founded in November 1944 .

Hope and Glory is an album by the British musician Tom Robinson . It was released in 1984 .
The album peaked at No . 21 on the UK Albums Chart . It contained three charting singles . Hope and Glory was a commercial failure in the United States ; it would be 10 years before Robinson released another album in the U.S .
Production
The album was produced by Robin Millar and Tom Robinson . `` Rikki Do n't Lose That Number '' is a cover of the Steely Dan song . `` Atmospherics : Listen to the Radio '' was written with Peter Gabriel .
Critical reception
Robert Christgau thought that `` 'War Baby ' is a wrenching triumph and 'Rikki Do n't Lose That Number ' a great moment in gay liberation . '' Trouser Press concluded that `` with the exception of 'Cabin Boy ' , a bouncy bit of gay double entendre , the best tracks are redone Sector 27 tunes . '' The Wall Street Journal opined that `` the record offers some first-rate material—particularly the wistful 'Atmospherics'—all delivered with Mr. Robinson 's warm , throaty voice . ''
The Washington Post wrote that Hope and Glory `` treats gay life to the sort of love songs heterosexual romance has enjoyed for centuries ... In a sense , the most exceptional thing about these songs is how mundane they seem . '' The Globe and Mail likened the sound of the album to soul music , writing that `` lots of jagged edges , spluttering saxophones , and dated production techniques ... enhance the rough-and-tumble arrangements , melodramatic poetry , and a constant edge of drive and anguish in Robinson 's uneven , sore-throat vocal style . ''
The Boston Globe listed the album among the best albums of 1984 , calling it `` a shamefully overlooked album by the gay British singer who has become an intelligent rocker of the first rank . '' Newsday considered Hope and Glory to be the fifth best album of 1985 .
AllMusic deemed the album `` a politically tinged but mostly mainstream rock record . ''

Initiatives
Anti-tobacco laws allow cigarette manufacturers to make fortunes from people 's health ( April 2008 ) Member of the Federation Council Kavdzharadze spoke in April 2008 about the problems of legislative regulation of tobacco consumption in Russia . In an interview with Rossiyskaya Gazeta , Kavdzharadze , as an active supporter of a healthy lifestyle , spoke about the legal control over `` smokers '' .
On a destructive passion for tobacco , tobacconists make fortunes that are not even in the millions . It makes no sense to deny the `` tobacco lobby '' , when it was mentioned by almost every politician who spoke at least once about smoking and the situation of tobacco in Russia .
Tobacco manufacturers have nothing against the unfolding struggle to limit smoking , they actively participate in it , forcing out other actors .
But when it comes to effective measures , it turns out that the opportunities for tobacco lobbyists are considerable . Their tactics boil down to initiating or simply pushing through legislative solutions that make tobacco restrictions as moderate and `` convenient '' as possible , in which people continue to smoke and do not stress too much about the consequences .
Due to the severe restrictions imposed on tobacco companies by the laws of other countries , all tobacco companies moved to Russia , where the legislation is still loyal to them . Up to 95 percent of the assets of the Russian tobacco industry are owned by transnational corporations . So the Russians are leading in terms of the amount of tobacco consumed , and the “ tobacco lobby ” will fight to the last for the largest sales market for products and warn about the dangers of smoking and , again , advertise tobacco . An active supporter of strict legal control over tobacco users , member of the Federation Council Kavdzharadze , told RG about the problems of legislative regulation of the consumption of tobacco products in Russia .
They also made the initiative to create a telecommunications network closed from the EU and the US was voiced at a meeting of the Federation Council Committee on Information Legislation , where new rules for registering bloggers were also discussed .
Their other proposal was a natural and logical idea that arose a few days after Vladimir Putin 's direct line , during which it was stated that the Internet was born as a CIA project . The proposed name determined in 2014 the word formation of a new term in colloquial Russian , which subsequently gave statistical results .

Kalanithi worries that cancer might have caused their symptoms and their decline of health – unlikely for people in their thirties . However , when X-ray results in a routine medical check-up return normal , their primary care physician and they attribute the symptoms to aging and work overload .
Determined to finish the last months of their residency , they ignore whatever symptoms have not subsided . A few weeks later , the symptoms come back , stronger than before . Around this time , Kalanithi and their wife experience conflict in their relationship when Lucy feels that they are not communicating with them Visiting friends in New York , Kalanithi is almost certain that they have cancer and says it out loud for the first time to their friend Mike . Returning home , upon landing in San Francisco , Kalanithi receives a call from their doctor telling them that their lungs `` look blurry . '' When they arrive home with Lucy , both of them know what is happening . The next day , Kalanithi checks in to the hospital , and the room where they examined their patients , delivering good and bad news , becomes their own .
Background
Before writing When Breath Becomes Air , Kalanithi was in residency in neurological surgery and a postdoctoral fellowship in neuroscience . In May 2013 , Kalanithi was diagnosed with stage-4 non-small-cell EGFR-positive lung cancer .
As Kalanithi underwent cancer treatment , they shared their reflections on illness and medicine , authoring essays in The New York Times , The Paris Review , and Stanford Medicine , and participating in interviews for media outlets and public forums . They also began work on an autobiographical book of their experiences as a doctor and a patient facing a terminal illness .
Kalanithi died in March 2015 at the age of 37 . Their memoir was published posthumously 10 months later . The book includes a foreword by Abraham Verghese and an epilogue by Kalanithi 's widow , Lucy Goddard Kalanithi .
Paul Kalanithi
The author of the book , Paul Kalanithi , was born in Bronxville , New York on April 1 , 1977 . At the age of 10 , their family moved to Kingman , Arizona where they spent most of their youth . At the early age of 10 , their mother gave them books to read in order to educate their young mind . Kalanithi attended Stanford University where they earned Bachelor and Master of Arts in English literature and Bachelor of Science in human biology . They attended Cambridge for history and philosophy of science and medicine where they obtained their Masters . After Cambridge , Kalanithi attended Yale for medical school where they met their future wife , Lucy Goddard . After graduating from Yale , they got married and began their residencies in California . Kalanithi started their residency back at Stanford while their wife attended University of California , San Francisco . Paul and Lucy have a daughter together .
Synopsis
Following the prospect of a better life , Kalanithi 's father moves the family from Bronxville , New York to Kingman , Arizona when Kalanithi is ten . A doctor himself , Kalanithi 's father dedicates most of their time to medicine and is notably absent from the house . Believing that to be a doctor , they would have to be away from the family like their father , Kalanithi becomes disenchanted with medicine . Although Kalanithi and their two brothers enjoy the newfound liberty of their desert town , their mother constantly worries for their academic future in a town that the U.S. census has declared “ the least educated district in America. ” Unwilling to let anything halt their learning , they acquire college reading lists and instills in their sons a love for literature . The summer before heading to Stanford University for school , Kalanithi reads Satan , Their Psychotherapy and Cure by the Unfortunate Dr. Kassler , J.S.P.S. , by Jeremy Leven . The book 's idea that the mind is the result of the brain doing its work awakes a curiosity in Kalanithi for neuroscience .
After completing degrees in English literature and human biology , Kalanithi feels there is still much to learn . They are accepted to a master 's program in English literature at Stanford , and one afternoon—pushed by their desire to understand the meaning of life— discovers the calling to practice medicine for the first time . Preparing to apply to medical school , Kalanithi uses the time off to study the history and philosophy of science and medicine at Cambridge . They later starts medical school at Yale . During their time at Yale , Kalanithi meets their wife , Lucy , and sees the patient-doctor relationship as an example of life , death , and morality coming together . After two years of classroom learning , Kalanithi experiences their first birth and death in their OB-GYN clinical rotation , when a set of twins could not be carried to term . It is then that Kalanithi understands that intelligence is not enough in the practice of medicine , and that morality is also needed . After medical school , Lucy Kalanithi starts internal medicine residency at UCSF and Paul Kalanithi begins a neurosurgical residency at Stanford . Though they find it hard at first , Kalanithi grows used to the rigor of neurosurgery and , in their fourth year , joins the neuroscience lab of a professor affectionately called “ V. ” In the sixth year of residency , Kalanithi returns to their hospital duties and having reached professional recognition , they feel they have finally found their place in the world .
Kalanithi 's life takes an unexpected turn when , after weeks of health problems , it is confirmed that they have lung cancer . Images obtained from a CT scan show organ systems compromised by the cancer , causing them and their wife great sadness . Searching for the best experts in the field of oncology , Kalanithi begins treatment with a doctor named Emma Hayward . Because of their status , rather than stepping back and letting Hayward offer their professional opinion , Kalanithi expects to be treated as a consultant , even if it is their own case . Hayward suggests finding the root of their cancer before determining treatment options . In the meantime , Kalanithi 's family helps them through their transition from doctor to patient and , together with Lucy , they decide to explore reproductive options before they die . They visit a sperm bank and make the decision to have a child . Test results arrive and Kalanithi discovers that their cancer is derived from a mutation in the epidermal growth factor receptor ( EGFR ) . This fact gives them a bit of relief because it means that they can be treated with Tarceva , which typically results in less-severe side effects compared to traditional chemotherapy .
Symptoms subside with the treatment and , in Dr. Hayward 's office , Kalanithi feels like themselves again . After weeks of using the medication , CT scans show a reduced number of tumors in Kalanithi 's lungs and they become determined to return to the operating room . Back in the OR , they can not finish their first surgery because of their health . However , their strength and technique improve over time . With both graduation and a baby due in June , they take another CT scan after months since the last . They discover a big tumor in their right lung and without getting scared , they and Lucy research what other options are available . Kalanithi retires from surgery indefinitely and begins chemotherapy . Their response to chemotherapy is adverse and their health worsens , forcing them to skip graduation . With the failure of chemotherapy , other treatment options do not provide them much hope . Their condition becomes so severe that even Dr. Hayward gives an approximation of how much time they have left – something they had strongly refused to do before . On July 4 , 2014 , their daughter is born and Kalanithi is filled with joy . Eventually , Kalanithi dies in the intensive care unit of their hospital .
The epilogue is written by their wife Lucy Kalanithi , after their death . It shows their point of view of the experience with their husband Paul Kalanithi 's lung cancer . It is an in-depth personal explanation of them experience .
Reception
When Breath Becomes Air is a New York Times bestseller , spending 68 weeks on the non-fiction bestseller list .

'' Nick Romeo of The Boston Globe wrote that it , `` possesses the gravity and wisdom of an ancient Greek tragedy . '' Melissa Maerz of Entertainment Weekly stated that the book was `` so original—and so devastating . . . . Its only fault is that the book , like their life , ends much too early . ''

The General Workers ' Union ( ; abbreviated UGT ) was an Argentine national labor confederation from 1903 to 1909 .
It was founded in 1903 as a rival to the country 's first national labor confederation , the Argentine Workers ' Federation ( FOA ) , known as the Argentine Regional Workers ' Federation ( FORA ) from 1905 . Around this time , the FOA had become more openly anarchist , leading to tension between the socialist syndicalists and the anarchists in the federation . The UGT was thus founded by the former and it was more moderate than its predecessor . Unlike the FOA , it did not discourage participation in elections and encouraged its members to become Argentine citizens - as the majority of the Argentine working class at the time consisted of European immigrants who were thus disenfranchised . Nonetheless , it claimed that general strike `` can be an effective means of struggle '' , but rejected starting it for `` violent ends '' . This position became more radical in the following years as the relations between the syndicalists in the UGT and the Socialist Party became more strained , and in 1906 the UGT declared that the general strike was `` an arm of struggle of superior effectiveness '' .
The UGT had 7,500 members in 1904 , membership peaked at 10,000 in 1906 . Despite the two organizations ' rivalry , there was a lot of cooperation between the FORA and the UGT . Together , they fought against the 1902 Residence Law , which allowed the expulsion of subversive aliens and collaborated on many strikes . On the local level , the cooperation was even more intense . During its last years of existence , the UGT was unable to gain members . Therefore , it merged with the more moderate syndicalists in the FORA in 1909 , to form the Argentine Regional Workers ' Confederation ( CORA ) .

Robert Leroy `` Buck '' Rodgers ( born August 16 , 1938 ) is a former catcher , manager and coach in Major League Baseball . They managed three major league teams : the Milwaukee Brewers ( 1980–1982 ) , Montreal Expos ( 1985–1991 ) and California Angels ( 1991–1994 ) , compiling a career won-lost mark of 784–773 ( .504 ) .
Playing career
Born in Delaware , Ohio , Rodgers graduated from Prospect High School in 1956 and was a star basketball player as well scoring over 1,700 points in their career and averaging 25 points per game over their Junior and Senior seasons with a high of 55 in 1956 . They attended Ohio Wesleyan University and Ohio Northern University . As a player , they signed their first professional contract with the Detroit Tigers in 1956 , spent five years in their farm system , and was selected by the Angels in the 1960 MLB Expansion Draft .
They were a top defensive catcher and a switch-hitter who played nine major league seasons ( 1961–1969 ) , all with the Angels , compiling a .232 batting average with 704 hits , 114 doubles , 18 triples and 31 home runs in 932 games played . As a player , Rodgers caught Bo Belinsky 's no-hitter on May 5 , 1962 .
Managerial career
In between their playing and managing careers , Rodgers served as a coach for the Minnesota Twins ( 1970–1974 ) , San Francisco Giants ( 1976 ) , and the Brewers ( 1978–1980 ) . They managed in the Angels ' farm system in 1975 and 1977 . Their managerial career was book-ended by unusual circumstances .
Milwaukee Brewers
They first became manager of the Brewers ( then a contending team in the American League East Division ) on an acting basis at the outset of the 1980 season . They were serving as the club 's third-base coach when manager George Bamberger suffered a heart attack . Rodgers posted a record of 26–21 as acting field boss until Bamberger was able to return June 4 . However , with the Brewers treading water under Bamberger with a record of 47–45 , the manager stepped down on September 9 , 1980 , and Rodgers resumed the helm , the team winning 13 of its last 23 games to ultimately finish third .
The 1981 campaign was disrupted for six weeks by an in-season players ' strike , which caused the major leagues to adopt a split-season format . Rodgers led the Brewers to the best overall record in the AL East at 62–47 and the second half title , but Milwaukee lost the divisional playoff to the New York Yankees , three games to two . It would be Rodgers ' only postseason appearance as a manager . In 1982 , the Brewers started slowly under Rodgers and they were fired June 1 with the team 's record a mediocre 23–24 . The Brewers then turned their season around under their successor , batting coach Harvey Kuenn , to finish with 95 wins and went on to win their only American League pennant as `` Harvey 's Wallbangers . ''
Montreal Expos
After guiding the Indianapolis Indians of the AAA American Association to the 1984 regular season championship , Rodgers was promoted to manager of the parent Expos , replacing Jim Fanning . Their first six years ( 1985–1990 ) in Montreal were largely successful , with the Expos averaging almost 84 wins per season , but when the team faltered in 1991 , winning only 20 of its first 49 games , Rodgers was replaced as manager by Tom Runnells on June 2 .
California Angels
On August 26 , 1991 , the Angels fired Doug Rader and hired Rodgers as their new manager . In their return to Anaheim , Rodgers led the Angels to a 20–18 record for the remainder of the campaign . They were 39 games into their first full season in 1992 when the team bus was involved in an expressway accident in New Jersey on May 20 . Rodgers was seriously injured in the crash and missed 90 games . After their recovery , they resumed the helm on August 28 , but their club lost 20 of 34 games to close the season . Then the 1993 Angels finished 20 games below .500 ( 71–91 ) . When the team started the season at 16–23 , Rodgers was fired on May 16 and replaced by Marcel Lachemann .

The 1937 Heze earthquakes struck the Mudan District in Shandong Province , China on July 31 and August 1 respectively . The surface-wave magnitude 6.9 and 6.7 earthquakes were centered near the city of Heze . 3,252 people died , and 12,701 were injured , although the total number of casualties has never been finalized . The earthquakes also resulted in the loss of more than 6,000 livestock and destroyed 470,000 homes . Due to the outbreak of the Second Sino-Japanese War , rescue operations by the Chinese government were ineffective .
Tectonic setting
Seismic activity in the North China Plain occur as a result of interaction between three crustal blocks that form the North China Craton . The western part of the craton consists of a continental rift system and the tectonically stable Ordos Plateau . At the center of the block is another rift that forms the North China Plain , and to the east , the Bohai Sea . Several large fault systems bound the North China Craton , including the Tanlu Fault . These faults have generated magnitude 8.0+ earthquakes in the past centuries including the 1668 Shandong and 1679 Sanhe-Pinggu earthquakes . The North China Plain also hosted the 1975 Haicheng and 1976 Tangshan earthquakes .
Earthquakes
The two shocks occurred on the 230-km-long Liaokao Fault Zone . The average slip rate along the fault over the past 47 years is measured at 9.24 mm/yr , and it has a strike-slip sense of movement .
Precursor events
Prior to the mainshocks , residents noted extremely unusual weather patterns in the area . Heavy rains and strong winds battered the region . The region also became unusually hot and humid , where several residents suffered heat injuries , and many livestock died . The temperature was so high that the walls of homes overheated and burned . The water level in wells also fluctuated many times . In some instances , the water rose and overflowed from these wells . Discoloration , bubbling , and foaming of well water were also observed .
A mere two or three days before the earthquakes , animals displayed peculiar behaviors . Swallow flocks did not disperse but slept around the area . Cattle did not consume grass , and horses refused to enter their stables . Mice were observed fleeing the epicenter area , and dogs barked continuously . The residents also reported witnessing glowing red fireballs rising from the ground and into the air . Thunderous sounds were heard coming from the ground .
Damage
In the meizoseismal area where the maximum seismic intensity was assigned IX ( Violent ) , all buildings collapsed and severe liquefaction occurred . The area encompassed the towns of Xieyuanji and Muli Malinggang . From Hezhe ; Malinggangzhen to the east ; Wubagang and Dongming to the west ; Tongguji in the south , and northward to Genghai . Intensity IX covered an area of 82 km2 . The second mainshock had a maximum intensity of VIII ( Severe ) .
In all , more than 3,252 people died , 12,701 were injured and over 470,000 homes were destroyed . The earthquakes caused damage in 40 counties across the provinces of Shandong , Henan , Anhui , Jiangsu , and Hebei . Its effects were also felt along the coast of the Bohai Sea , in Beijing , Zhenjiang , and Luoyang . At Xuzhou in Jiangsu , 50 homes collapsed , killing over 20 people . Homes also collapsed in Feixiang and Daming , Hebei Province . Several huts fell in Dangshan County , Anhui .
An estimated 30 % of all residential homes in Heze were destroyed . Some sections of the city walls and battlements were torn down . The well-known Guanyin Temple also collapsed . Water ejected from the ground through wells . In Dongming County , 20 % of the county homes were lost . Six people died and ground fissures erupted water . Some fissures were up to one meter wide and were reported as far as 30 km from the epicenter . A farmer fell into one of the fissures and was washed away by rushing water .

Molière is a 2007 film by the French director Laurent Tirard and starring Romain Duris as Molière . It was released in Europe in January 2007 and in the United States in July 2007 . It was entered into the 29th Moscow International Film Festival where Fabrice Luchini won the Silver George for Best Actor . The screenplay was co-written by Tirard and Grégoire Vigneron .
Plot
The film begins in 1658 , when the French actor and playwright returns to Paris with their theatrical troupe to perform in the theatre that the king 's brother has given him . Most of the film is in the form of a flashback to 1645 . Following an unsuccessful run as a tragic actor , Molière is released from debtor 's prison by Monsieur Jourdain , a wealthy commoner with social pretensions , who agrees to pay the young actor 's debts if Molière teaches them to act .
Jourdain , a married man with two daughters , hopes to use this talent to ingratiate themselves with Célimène , a recently widowed aristocrat with whom they have become obsessed . They hope to perform a short play they have written for the occasion . Molière , however , has been presented to the family and staff of Monsieur Jourdain as Tartuffe , a priest who is to serve as tutor for the Jourdains ' younger daughter . As the story progresses Molière proceeds to fall in love with Jourdain 's neglected wife , Elmire . Sub-plots involve the love life of the Jourdains ' older daughter , and the intrigues of the penniless and cynical aristocrat Dorante at the expense of the gullible Jourdain .
The story is mostly fictional and many scenes follow actual scenes and text in Molière 's plays including Tartuffe , Le Misanthrope , Le Malade imaginaire and Le Bourgeois gentilhomme , whose principal character is also named Jourdain . It is implied that these `` actual '' events in their life inspired the plays of their maturity .

BeWILDerwood is an adventure park for families located in Horning , a parish in the English county of Norfolk . Self-described
as a `` curious treehouse adventure , '' the attraction is situated in a woodland area and features treehouses , rope bridges , slides , zip wires , a maze , and two special areas for children under five called `` Toddlewood-on-the-Hill '' and `` Tiptoe Valley '' . The original branding was created by Purple Circle .
Entrance is as if to the whole forest and the adventure world of rope bridges and treehouses is a river ride away , through the 'swamp ' and past the creature who blows bubbles to the surface . The park is set up to give a more natural appearance than typical urban ones with extensive use of natural materials . Swings are three people wide as are some of the scary slides .
The park 's rides and other features are based on characters and events in A Boggled at BeWILDerwood and The Bewilderbats , books for children written by BeWILDerwood 's owner Tom Blofeld and illustrated by .... A Boggled at BeWILDerwood recounts the adventures of Swampy the marsh boggle as they struggle to overcome their fears and be a little braver . In the sequel , Bewilderbats , Swampy and their friends set out to rescue a tiny Twiggle who is stuck up a tree .

Gerhard Heinrich Friedrich Otto Julius Herzberg , ( ; December 25 , 1904 – March 3 , 1999 ) was a German-Canadian pioneering physicist and physical chemist , who won the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 1971 , `` for their contributions to the knowledge of electronic structure and geometry of molecules , particularly free radicals '' . Herzberg 's main work concerned atomic and molecular spectroscopy . They are well known for using these techniques that determine the structures of diatomic and polyatomic molecules , including free radicals which are difficult to investigate in any other way , and for the chemical analysis of astronomical objects . Herzberg served as Chancellor of Carleton University in Ottawa , Ontario , Canada from 1973 to 1980 .
Early life and family
Herzberg was born in Hamburg , Germany on December 25 , 1904 to Albin H. Herzberg and Ella Biber . They had an older brother , Walter , who was born in January 1904 . Herzberg started Vorschule ( pre-school ) late , after contracting measles . Gerhard and their family were atheists and kept this fact hidden . Their father died in 1914 , at 43 years of age , after having suffered from dropsy and complications due to an earlier heart condition . Herzberg graduated Vorschule shortly after their father 's death . Their wife , Luise Herzberg , died in 1971 .
Education and career
Initially , Herzberg considered a career in astronomy , but their application to the Hamburg Observatory was returned advising them not to pursue a career in the field without private financial support . After completing high school at the Gelehrtenschule des Johanneums , Herzberg continued their education at Darmstadt University of Technology with the help of a private scholarship . Herzberg completed their Dr.-Ing . degree under Hans Rau in 1928 .

Honours and awards
Herzberg 's most significant award was the 1971 Nobel Prize in Chemistry , which they were awarded `` for their contributions to the knowledge of electronic structure and geometry of molecules , particularly free radicals '' . During the presentation speech , it was noted that at the time of the award , Herzberg was `` generally considered to be the world 's foremost molecular spectroscopist . ''
Herzberg was honoured with memberships or fellowships by a very large number of scientific societies , received many awards and honorary degrees in different countries . The NSERC Gerhard Herzberg Canada Gold Medal for Science and Engineering , Canada 's highest research award , was named in their honour in 2000 . The Canadian Association of Physicists also has an annual award named in their honour . The Herzberg Institute of Astrophysics is named for him . They were made a member of the International Academy of Quantum Molecular Science . Asteroid 3316 Herzberg is named after him . In 1964 they were awarded the Frederic Ives Medal by the OSA . At Carleton University , there is a building named after them that belongs to the Physics and Mathematics/Statistics Departments , Herzberg Laboratories . Herzberg was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society ( FRS ) in 1951 .
The main building of John Abbott College in Montreal is named after him . Carleton University named the Herzberg Laboratories building after him . A public park in the College Park neighbourhood of Saskatoon also bears their name .
Books and publications
Herzberg authored some classic works in the field of spectroscopy , including Atomic Spectra and Atomic Structure and the encyclopaedic four volume work : Molecular Spectra and Molecular Structure , which is often called the spectroscopist 's bible . The three volumes of Molecular Spectra and Molecular Structure were re-issued by Krieger in 1989 , including extensive new footnotes by Herzberg . Volume IV of the series , `` Constants of diatomic molecules '' is purely a reference work , a compendium of known spectroscopic constants ( and therefore a bibliography of molecular spectroscopy ) of diatomic molecules up until 1978 .

The 1900 Summer Olympics took place in Paris , France , and was the first time ever that golf debuted in the Olympics . Two golf events were contested , individual events for men and women . As with most other events in the 1900 Olympics , few , if any , of the competitors had any idea that they were competing in an Olympic game .
Format
The men 's division consisted of a 36-hole stroke play tournament , while the women 's division consisted of only a 9-hole stroke play tournament .
Location
The men 's and women 's event took place at the Compiègne Club , which is about 50 km ( 30 miles ) north of Paris . This golf club was built in 1896 and is one of few golf courses built outside Great Britain or Ireland in the 19th century . The golf course was designed by M.W . Freemantle and built within the horse racing track of Compiègne . The layout of the course is flat , with dense rough surrounding the fairways and very tiny `` postage stamp '' sized greens .
Tournament play
The men 's tournament was played on 2 October 1900 where they played two 18-hole rounds back-to-back . The following day , 3 October 1900 , the women 's tournament began , where they only played 9 holes .
Men 's division
Charles Sands , representative of the St. Andrews Golf Club in Yonkers , New York finished the 36 hole tournament with 82-85 defeating Walter Rutherford of Jedburgh , Scotland by a mere one stroke . Finishing third for the men 's division and receiving the bronze medal was David Robertson . Sands started playing golf in 1895 and three months later participated and made it to the final round of the first U.S . Amateur only to be beaten badly by Charles B. MacDonald . The only other golf tournament Sands ever competed in was the 1900 Summer Olympics .
Women 's division
The women 's division was a stage for many firsts that occurred in the Olympic games . Not only was this the first time women were ever able to compete in the Olympic games , the women 's division was won by Margaret Abbott of Chicago Golf Club . Abbott shot a 47 to win and became the first ever American female to win a gold medal in the Olympic Games , though they received a gilded porcelain bowl as a prize instead of a medal . They are also the second overall American woman to receive an Olympic medal . Abbott 's mother , Mary Abbott , also competed in this Olympic event and finished tied for seventh , shooting a 65 . They were the first and only mother and daughter that have ever competed in the same Olympic event at the same time .
Margaret never knew that they were competing in the Olympics ; they thought it was a normal golf tournament and died not knowing . Them historic victory was not known until University of Florida professor Paula Welch began to do research into the history of the Olympics and discovered that Margaret Abbott had placed first . Over the course of ten years , they contacted Abbott 's children and informed them of their mother 's victory .

Trinity Theatre is a theatre and arts centre , located in the former Holy Trinity Church in the centre of Royal Tunbridge Wells , Kent .
Holy Trinity Church : 1829–1972
As a developing spa town , Tunbridge Wells was short of church capacity , and had no parish church . In 1818 , the Church Commissioners created a fund to provide new churches in growing towns , for which it was decided by the residents and visitors to the town to apply for . Led by Lord Abergavenny , a subscription fund was started , which raised the £10,591 construction costs . Architect Decimus Burton ( 1800–1881 ) , who had already been commissioned to design villas in Calverley Park , agreed to design the building , to a then popular Gothic Revival architecture style . Built in locally quarried sandstone from Calverley Quarry , the first stone was laid on 17 August 1827 . Constructed by Mr Barrett of Tunbridge Wells , the finished church , which cost just over £12,000 to complete including fitting out , was consecrated in September 1829 .
Due to the popularity of Tunbridge Wells in the Victorian age , a number of churches were built in the town . Hence following the fall in congregation numbers after World War II , the town had a number of churches which were in great need of major maintenance . As the largest church in the town , it was decided to decommission it . The church held its last religious service in 1972 .
Derelict : 1973-1981
In 1974 the Church Commissioners declared Holy Trinity `` redundant to pastoral needs , '' thereby allowing for its potential demolition , and redevelopment of the site as housing or offices . However , after a petition was raised by the Royal Tunbridge Wells Civic Society , the commissioners gave the society one year to find a suitable public use for the building . After approving in principle a plan to turn the building into a community theatre and arts centre in 1976 , £50,000 was raised in six months , to allow a long term lease to be agreed from January 1977 with the Diocese of Rochester .
Trinity Theatre : 1982-present
Supported by Tunbridge Wells Borough Council ( £15,000 ) , Kent County Council and Arts Council England , over a five-year period the internal redevelopment addressed dry rot and damaged stonework , to turn the building into a theatre with 350 raked seats .
Subsequent grants have allowed developments to include a cafeteria , public bar , and redevelopment of the side vestibules to allow for art shows and local arts classes . In March 1996 an application was approved by the National Lottery for £600,000 of additional internal improvements , which provided a computerised box office , new seats , and an access ramp for wheelchair users .
In its now 25-year history , Trinity Theatre has collaborated with performers and groups from Steven Berkoff to the Royal National Theatre , as well as hosting international performing arts , film and visual arts . With over 90,000 people now coming through its doors annually , Trinity is acknowledged as one of the leading arts and performance venues in the South East of England .
Tunbridge Wells Theatre Club
Originally launched in 1946 as the Tunbridge Wells Drama Club , after the church became available in 1977 , the club and its committee became central to the buildings revival . After the restoration of the building in 1982 , it renamed itself as Trinity Theatre Club . Today it is one of the most active amateur theatre clubs in the southeast , putting on four productions per annum .

Lucene Geographic and Temporal ( LGTE ) is an information retrieval tool developed at Technical University of Lisbon which can be used as a search engine or as evaluation system for information retrieval techniques for research purposes . The first implementation powered by LGTE was the search engine of DIGMAP , a project co-funded by the community programme eContentplus between 2006 and 2008 , which was aimed to provide services available on the web over old digitized maps from a group of partners over Europe including several National Libraries .
The tool LGTE is built in Java Programming Language around the Lucene library for full-text search and introduces several extensions for dealing with geographical and temporal information . The package also includes utilities for information retrieval evaluation , such as classes for handling CLEF/TREC ( Cross Language Evaluation Forúm/Text Retrieval Conference ) topics and document collections .
Technically LGTE is a layer on the top of Lucene and provides an extended Lucene API to integrate several services like snippets generation , query expansion , and many others . The LGTE provides the chance to implement new probabilistic models . The API depends on a set of modifications at the Lucene level , originally created by the researchers of the University of Amsterdam in a software tool named Lucene-lm developed by the group of Information and Language Processing Systems ( ILPS ) . At the time , the tool was tested with success for the Okapi BM25 model , and a multinomial language model , but also includes divergence from randomness models .
The LGTE 1.1.9 and later versions also provide the possibility to isolate the index fields in different index folders . Another recent feature is the configuration of Hierarchic Indexes using foreign key fields . This gives the chance to create scores for example based on the text of the sentence combined with the general score of the entire page .
Features
Provides Isolated Fields using different folders
Provides Hierarchic indexes through foreign key fields
Provides classes to parse documents using Yahoo PlaceMaker
Provides a simple and effective abstraction layer on top of Lucene
Supports integrated retrieval and ranking with basis on thematic , temporal and geographical aspects .
Supports the Lucene standard retrieval model , as well as the more advanced probabilistic retrieval approaches .
Supports Rochio Query Expansion .
Provides a framework for IR evaluation experiments ( e.g . handling CLEF/TREC topics ) .
Includes a Java alternative to the trec_eval tool , capable of performing significance tests over pairs of runs .
Includes a simple test application for searching over the Braun Corpus or the Cranfield Corpus .

The World Is Bardo ( Le Monde est Bardo ) was the slogan and theme of a peaceful , anti-terrorist rally and march that took place on 29 March 2015 in Tunis , Tunisia . Thousands of Tunisians came out to protest the 18 March Bardo National Museum terrorist attacks by the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant ( ISIL ) and to express support for the victims . Many world leaders participated to the event including François Hollande , Matteo Renzi , Bronislaw Komorowski , Mahmoud Abbas , Ali Bongo Ondimba , Abdelmalek Sellal , Charles Michel , Abdullah al-Thani , Federica Mogherini and Beji Caid Essebsi .
Organization
After the terrorist attack on the Bardo National Museum , the Government of Tunisia decided to organize a protest in reaction against the attack and terrorism . The event was composed of two marches : A march for civil and an official march involving dignitaries and world leaders . The popular march passed through the important roads of Tunis before arriving at the Bardo National Museum . The official march ended inside the museum .
Speaking before the beginning of the march , Habib Essid , the Prime Minister of Tunisia , announced the death of nine terrorists from ISIL who were behind the attack .
Circumstances
The popular march had many thousands of moderate Tunisian citizens protesting ISIL terrorism ; they adopted the chant , `` Tunisia is free ! Terrorism out ! '' In the official march , a memorial listing the names of victims was unveiled next to the main doors of the museum . Beji Caid Essebsi , the President of Tunisia , delivered a speech in which they thanked all of the participating leaders and said that the Tunisian people had proved that they were not afraid of terrorism and that they would stand as one to face it . In the same speech , they accidentally called François Hollande , the President of France , by the name of François , the President of France . Hollande laughed and the two leaders kissed each other . After the speech , participating world leaders visited the Bardo National Museum .

Dapivirine ( DPV ) Ring is an antiretroviral vaginal ring pioneered by the International Partnership for Microbicides ( IPM ) pending for regulatory review . It is designed as a long-acting form of HIV prevention for at-risk women , particularly in developing nations such as sub-Saharan Africa . IPM has rights to both the medication and the medical device . A total of four rings with different drug diffusion systems and polymer composition have been developed by IPM . The latest design , Ring-004 , is a silicone polymer matrix-type system capable of delivering DPV intravaginally in a sustained manner .
From 2009 to 2012 , two Phases I and one Phase I/II safety trials of the DPV ring were conducted by IPM . Results deemed the device to be well-tolerated and safe . In 2012 , two Phase III studies were sequentially launched––The Ring Study and ASPIRE . The Ring Study was sponsored by IPM . ASPIRE was sponsored by Microbicide Trials Network ( MTN ) . Both studies indicated the effectiveness of the ring in reducing the risk of HIV transmission . In July 2016 , two open-label studies , DREAM and HOPE were launched following the successful results from the Phase III studies . Insights on the utilisation of the tool by women were illuminated . DPV Rings were given to the former Phase III trial participants for one whole year . HOPE ended in October 2018 and DREAM ended in January 2019 . In 2019 , the results of both studies were published which indicated up to 54 % efficacy .
The risk of DPV resistance ; ring 's negative impact on intimate relationships , and inaccurate rumours surrounding the device are potential drawbacks limiting the overall implementation of the technology . Alternative long-acting rings with similar functionality to the DPV Ring are under development by IPM .
Product design
The DPV Ring is a discreet HIV microbicide tool developed by IPM for vulnerable female populations . In 2018 , South Africa faced a high adult HIV prevalence ( 20.4 % ) , with 7.7 million people living with HIV . More than 60 % of those affected are female . IPM aims to alleviate the disproportionate burden of females on the virulent virus across South Africa through the provision of the ring .
DPV , an HIV-1 non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( NNRTI ) , is slowly released via local intravaginal administration from the ring over the course of one month . The attachment and inhibition of HIV reverse transcriptase by DPV prevent HIV genome replication within the host upon initial exposure to the virus . Replacement of the ring is needed at the end of each month due to the dissipation of the drug component . The antiretroviral is also owned by IPM .
The device is a one-size that fits all . It has a whitish , opaque colour with an outer diameter of 56 mm and a cross-sectional diameter of 7.7 mm . Injection moulding of silicone elastomers forms the shape of the ring . It is similar in polymeric composition , shape , and size to commercially available contraceptive or therapeutic hormonal replacement vaginal rings such as Estring and Femring . The silicone elastomer composition provides suitable biocompatibility and durability to the wearer . In-situ movement of the ring in the vagina is restricted by the muscular walls of the vagina and the cervix . This prevents object entry into the uterus or any accidental slip out of the device .
Four prototypes were initially developed and tested in several clinical studies . There are two diffusion systems of these prototypes––a reservoir-type ( Ring-001 & Ring-002 ) and a matrix-type ( Ring-003 & Ring-004 ) . Both forms differ in their drug-delivery mechanism and composition design .
Reservoir-type rings ( Ring-001 & Ring-002 )
Reservoir-type rings contain drug-reservoir cores that are dispersed within cured silicone elastomers . These cores contain an antiretroviral that dissolves in the polymeric component via diffusion . A concentration gradient is then established between the core inside the ring and the vaginal space . Reservoir-types also possess a porous outer sheath of the ring that acts as a rate-controlling membrane . Both the concentration gradient and the semi-permeable sheath allows the release of medication into the vaginal space . This maintains a constant drug release rate at the site of potential infection .
The similarities and differences between the two prototypes of reservoir-type rings are tabulated below :
Matrix-type rings ( Ring-003 & Ring-004 )
In contrast to reservoir-type rings , matrix-types do not contain drug-filled cores and outer polymeric sheaths . Instead , the homogeneous dispersion of DPV in a cured silicone elastomer matrix is used . This diffusion system allows the sustained-release of the medication over time . A brief burst effect of the antiretroviral in vaginal fluids is characteristic to initial insertion of matrix-type rings for normal therapeutic response . A prolonged––but not constant––gradual release of DPV into the vaginal tissues is then maintained for sufficient drug dosage .
The similarities and differences between the two prototypes of matrix-type rings are tabulated below :
Clinical trials
Phase I
Ring-001 , -002 , and -003 were tested in Phase I trials . These prototypes demonstrated safety and acceptability to wearers over a 4-week period . This deemed the ring 's potential effectiveness in preventing HIV-1 . Despite testing , they were not developed further due to the improved polymerisation stability exhibited in Ring-004 .
Phase I/II
Between 2010 and 2011 , a safety and tolerability Phase I/II study ( IPM-015 ) of Ring-004 was conducted in Kenya , Malawi , South Africa , and Tanzania . A sampling pool of 280 African women aged 18 to 40 were involved . The device was reported to be safe and well-accepted by wearers throughout the continuous 12-week utilisation period . However , a few reports of mild adverse effects caused by the ring were mentioned such as pelvic abnormalities , vaginal discharge , intermenstrual bleeding . In terms of sexual acceptability , more than half of the participants stated that the DPV Ring did not affect vaginal intercourse with their male partner . Only 1-3 % reported that their male partner felt it which led to thoughts of extreme doubt about the continued adherence to the ring . A very high self-reported adherence to daily use was also cited , with 97 % expressing support to the prospective continual use to the tool if proven effective .
Phase III
IPM and MTN conducted two Phase III studies between 2012 and 2016 ( The Ring Study and ASPIRE ) to test the efficacy and long-term safety of the DPV Ring . ASPIRE ( MTN-020 ) investigated the extended use of the device on HIV prevention . Over 2,500 women at the age of 18 to 45 in Malawi , Uganda , and Zimbabwe participated in the study . The results of this trial confirmed a 27 % reduction in new HIV infections overall and a 67 % reduction for those over 25 years old . This demonstrated a significant age-related dependency on microbicide ring efficiency . Moreover , the partial use of the tool resulted in a 45 % reduction in HIV infection risk among women .
The Ring Study ( IPM-027 ) , conducted from April 2012 to December 2016 , enrolled around 2,000 women aged from 18 to 45 . It transformed into an open-label study in Uganda after it released early results in February 2016 due to the recommendation of an independent safety and monitoring board . MTN revealed at the International AIDS Conference 2016 in July that participants who had consistent use of the DPV ring had a 56 % lower risk of HIV . However , women younger than 21 years old are less likely to adhere to the intravaginal HIV microbicide regimen .
From 2016 to 2018 , Phase III/IIIb open-label clinical trials HOPE ( MTN-025 ) and DREAM ( IPM-032 ) were launched to focus on the safety and tolerability of the tool on a monthly basis . These trials included participants across South Africa . The Boston Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections in 2018 presented initial results in which the ring displayed high efficacy at 54 % . The HIV incidence per year observed in both HOPE and DREAM studies are 1.9 % and 1.8 % respectively . Both rates are substantially lower than that of the ASPIRE placebo ring HIV incidence per year ( > 4 % ) .
Concerns
Drug resistance
HIV-1 Group M subtype C is the most dominant lineage of HIV in sub-Saharan Africa . There is evidence of frequent cross-resistance to DPV among HIV-1 Group M subtype C from South Africans with first-generation NNRTI resistance such as Nevirapine and Efavirenz . This cites a possibility of DPV ineffectiveness .
Invasiveness on intimate relationships
Physical characteristics of the ring such as size and hardness were a topic of concern amongst participants . The ease of insertion and lack of interference in their daily lives were perceived to be of great importance to the demographic . Most of the females in the study are in a relationship . Statements on the impact of the device on relationship dynamics and sexual experience amongst couples were revealed . Many partnered wearers harboured apprehensive feelings as they were scared of their partners ' reaction to the ring or that they may feel the ring during sexual intercourse . Some even hid the fact that they wear it and maintained secrecy through abstinence or refrained from certain sexual positions . Therefore , this posed discussions on the ring 's negative impact on interpersonal relationships , causing psychosocial strain and disturbed sexual experience .
Negative rumours
The spread of negative rumours surrounding the ring was prevalent amongst locals during the ASPIRE study . In 2018 , follow-up studies have revealed that the prominent claims were about its carcinogenicity and its ability to cause infertility . Mentions of population control method by disease transfer via the ring were widespread as well . There was also a pervasive conflation of the device with witchcraft or Satanism . This is attributed to traditional Christian values and beliefs that are widely practiced across the South African region . Instilled fear regarding the novel tool stems from the fact that it is a vaginally administered object which incited claims of its unnatural nature by the locals . Hence , participants were forced to remove the ring or drop out of the study due to these concerns raised by their communities .
Development of vaginal ring alternatives
Since 2017 , a three-month DPV Ring option has been under clinical trial . A number of alternative intravaginal rings made by IPM are under further testing or in preclinical developmental delay due to insufficient funding , including :
Dapivirine-Contraceptive Ring : a three-month multipurpose ring containing DPV and contraceptive Levonorgestrel hormone .
DS003-Dapivirine Ring : a three-month combined antiretroviral ring containing DPV and DS003 .
Darunavir Ring : a one-month combined antiretroviral ring containing Darunavir and a second antiretroviral medication .

James Hall ( 15 October 1892 – 13 November 1953 ) , better known as Seaman Nobby Hall , was a Scottish boxer who was British and European lightweight champion between 1922 and 1923 .
Career
Born in Peebles in 1892 , James Hall began their professional boxing career in 1917 . A sailor on the Royal Navy , they won several Imperial Services Championships , but began their pro career with two defeats . In February 1919 they beat former British bantamweight champion Curley Walker on points and in November drew with Ted Moore . In August 1921 they took a notable scalp when they beat former British , European , and World champion Matt Wells and in January 1922 beat French champion Georges Papin .
Undefeated since September 1920 , in September 1922 they beat Ernie Rice at Liverpool Stadium to become lightweight champion of Britain and Europe . They suffered their first defeat in two years the following month when they were beaten on points by Alex Ireland .
They successfully defended their British title in January 1923 against Johnny Brown at the Industrial Hall in Edinburgh , but lost both titles at Olympia in May to Harry Mason , after being disqualified in the thirteenth round for low blows . They lost again to Mason in October .
They continued boxing , largely without their earlier success until the end of 1924 . After being out of the ring in 1925 they returned in January 1926 to fight Tommy McInnes , losing by an eighth-round knockout . It was almost two and a half years before their next fight , a win over Kid Charlie at the New World Arena in Singapore . Hall would fight at locations where the ship that they were serving on docked .
From mid-1931 to early 1934 they fought more regularly in the UK and while they fought some notable boxers of the time they never again challenged for a title . They made a final comeback in October 1935 , at the age of 43 , drawing with Jim Hendry .

The Zimbabwe cricket team toured the United Arab Emirates in March 2021 to play two Test and three Twenty20 International ( T20I ) matches against Afghanistan . It was the first time the two teams had played a Test match against each other . Ahmed Shah Pakteen was named as the on-field umpire for both Tests , becoming the first Afghan umpire to officiate in Test cricket .
Originally the series was scheduled to be played in Oman . In January 2021 , the International Cricket Council ( ICC ) gave accreditation for the Ministry Turf 1 at the Al Amerat Cricket Stadium in Muscat to host Test cricket . However , in February 2021 , the Afghanistan Cricket Board ( ACB ) confirmed that the series would take place in the UAE . The series was initially put into doubt due to the COVID-19 pandemic , however in late January 2021 , Zimbabwe 's Sports and Recreation Commission gave its approval for the tour to take place . On 12 February 2021 , the ACB announced the tour schedule .
Zimbabwe won the first Test inside two days by ten wickets , with captain Sean Williams scoring a century in their first innings . Zimbabwe last won a Test match in November 2018 , when they beat Bangladesh . Afghanistan won the second Test match by six wickets to draw the series 1–1 , with Hashmatullah Shahidi becoming the first batsman for Afghanistan to score a double century in Test cricket .
Afghanistan won the first two T20I matches , by 48 and 45 runs respectively , to win the series with a game to spare . Afghanistan won the third and final match by 47 runs , with Asghar Afghan becoming the most successful captain in men 's T20I cricket .
Squads
Afghanistan also named Zahir Khan and Abdul Wasi as reserve players for the Test matches . Chamu Chibhabha , Zimbabwe 's limited overs captain , did not travel for the T20I matches due to an injury .

Sage 50cloud is a set of accountancy and payroll products developed by Sage Group aimed at small and medium enterprises . Sage offer different products under the Sage 50 name in different regions . The product name originally derives from the UK and Ireland version of the product where the number 50 indicated that it was aimed at companies with up to 50 employees .
UK/Ireland version
In the UK and Ireland there are currently four products under the Sage 50 banner ; Accounts , Payroll , HR and P11D . Sage 50cloud Accounts was the market-leading accounting solution for many years .
The product currently known as Sage 50cloud Accounts has its origins in some of the earliest solutions that Sage produced . A direct relative of the current product is the Sage Sterling range which became available in September 1989 as a replacement for Sage 's successful Businesswise Accounts range . Sage Sterling was available for DOS and in the early 1990s for Microsoft Windows . The product was re-branded as Sage Sterling +2 and in 1993 a version of the product became available for Apple Macintosh . By 1993 Sage Sterling was market leader having accounted for 62.5 % of the integrated accounting software market . In the late 1990s , Sage Instant , a cut-down version of the product line was introduced .
Later , the product was rebranded as Sage Line 50 , a reference to the target market of the product , and in the 2000s was rebranded to simply Sage 50 . In the 2010s cloud-connected functionality was added to the product line and the current 50cloud name began to be used . The UK/Ireland Sage 50cloud products are developed in Newcastle upon Tyne , England .
US version
The US version of the product was previously called Peachtree Accounting . A conversion to the Peachtree/Sage 50 data format was made available when Simply Accounting was taken off the market . In 2013 it was brought under the Sage 50 banner .
Peachtree Accounting was originally sold by a software publisher founded in Atlanta in 1978 by Ben Dyer , Ron Roberts , Steve Mann , and John Hayes . The company was carved out of The Computersystem Center , an early Altair dealer founded by Roberts , Mann , Jim Dunion , and Rich Stafford , which Dyer had joined as the manager and where its first software was published in 1977 . Peachtree was the first successful business software made for microcomputers , supplanting the General Ledger programmed with CBASIC and distributed by Structured Systems Group . It is the oldest microcomputer computer program for business in current use .
The company expanded its offerings with its acquisition of Layered , an accounting program designed for use on the Macintosh . The company 's products were included in the initial launch of the IBM Personal Computer , and it was acquired by Management Science America ( MSA ) in June 1981 .
By early 1984 InfoWorld estimated that Peachtree was the world 's seventh-largest microcomputer-software company , with $ 21.7 million in 1983 sales . After several subsequent changes of ownership ending with ADP , Peachtree was eventually acquired by the Sage Group in 1998 for a million .
In the US , many schools utilize this program in their Accounting classes .
Canadian version
The Canadian version of Sage 50 was previously known as Bedford Accounting and later renamed to Simply Accounting . In 2013 it was brought under the Sage 50 banner .
Bedford Software developed Bedford Integrated Accounting for DOS in 1985 and for Macintosh in 1988 , then naming it Simply Accounting . Bedford Software was acquired by Computer Associates in 1989 . Simply Accounting became an Independent Business Unit of Computer Associates in 1996 and subsequently incorporated as ACCPAC International , Inc. in 1998 . ACCPAC was acquired by The Sage Group in 2004 for integration with its ERP products . It is developed in Richmond , British Columbia .
French version
The French version of the product , known as Sage 50cloud Ciel , was originally developed by Ciel , the French software business , founded in 1986 that Sage acquired in 1992 .
German/Austrian version
The Austrian and German versions of the product were formerly known as Sage GS-Office . It came under the Sage 50 banner in 2015 .
Polish version
The Polish version of the product was known as Sage Symfonia 50cloud , until it was acquired by Mid Europa Partners in 2021 and rebranded as Symfonia .
Spanish version
The Spanish version of the product was formerly known as Sage ContaPlus . First offered in the early 1980s by Grupo SP , it gained incredible popularity in 1990 by using newsstands as point of sale and was offered at very low prices at a time where professional accounting was very expensive . ContaPlus also took advantage of the Spanish accounting reform of 1990 . Nowadays , ContaPlus is the `` accounting standard '' in Spain with more than one million customers . Grupo SP was purchased by Sage in 2003 .
South African version
South African version , Sage 50cloud Pastel , was formerly known as Pastel Accounting and has been available since 1989 . The product was initially developed by Pastel Software who were purchased by Softline in 1999 . The product then became known as Softline Pastel . Sage acquired Softline in 2003 and the product eventually became known as Sage Pastel and later Sage 50cloud Pastel . It is widely used in industry , with job advertisements frequently requiring proficiency in the software , and training courses are available by third-party providers .

The American Family Field Walk of Fame is an exhibit located at American Family Field in Milwaukee , Wisconsin , that commemorates baseball players , coaches , executives , and broadcasters who have made significant contributions to Major League Baseball ( MLB ) in Milwaukee . Established by the Milwaukee Brewers MLB team in 2001 with the opening of the stadium , it encompasses the entire history of the Brewers since 1970 and that of the Milwaukee Braves , who played in the city from 1953 to 1965 . Twenty-one individuals have been inducted as of 2022 .
Each inductee is honored with a home plate-shaped granite slab featuring their name , uniform number , signature , and years associated with Milwaukee baseball . The slabs are arranged around American Family Field , circling the stadium and culminating with the statues of Hall of Famers Hank Aaron and Robin Yount , former team owner and Commissioner of Baseball Bud Selig , and broadcaster Bob Uecker .
Unlike the Milwaukee Brewers Wall of Honor exhibit at American Family Field , which honors only former Brewers who meet set criteria regarding career milestones or service time , individuals are elected to the Walk of Fame by Wisconsin media members and Brewers executives . Annual ballots include Brewers and Braves who were members of either team for a minimum of three seasons and have been retired for at least three years . Anyone named on 65 % or more of all ballots cast is elected . Individuals must receive at least 5 % of the vote to remain eligible in future years .

Walthard was the initial archiepiscopal candidate of the cathedral chapter on the death of Archbishop Giseler in 1004 , but King Henry II elected to appoint their chaplain Tagino instead . When Tagino died on 9 June 1012 , the cathedral elected Walthard , but they died within a few months and they elected one named Otto , who was passed over again by the king in favour of Gero . Otto was accepted into the royal chaplaincy as a consolation .

The Wutinoceratidae are a family of early actinocerids defined by Shimazu and Obata in 1938 for actinocerids with thick connecting rings and a complex irregular canal system . Actinocerids are generally straight shelled nautiloid cephalopods with a siphuncle composed of expanded segments , typically with thin connecting rings , in which the internal deposits are penetrated by a system of canals .
The Wutinoceratidae include three genera , Wutinoceras , Cyrtonybyoceras , and Adamsoceras , known especially from the early Middle Ordovician ( Whiterock stage ) in northeastern China and North America , but found also from the same age in Australia and northern Europe . Wutinoceras is the earliest and gave rise to Cyrtonybyoceras and Adamsoceras . Cyrtonybyoceras left no descendants , but Adamsoceras gave rise to the Ormoceratidae . Wutinoceras , further on , gave rise to the Armenoceratidae and possibly to the immediate ancestors of Actinoceras .

Critical reception
Awarding the album five stars from CCM Magazine , Matt Conner replies , `` It 's a rare triumph on both counts that should glow beautifully as one of the year 's best ... It 's certainly Assad 's best . '' Gary Durbin , dispensing a four-star rating upon the album at Worship Leader , responds , `` Inheritance is a collection of old and new songs that are both beautifully bright and dark . '' Assigning the album four and a half stars for Jesus Freak Hideout , Roger Gelwicks recognizes , `` Walking the tightrope between reverence and innovation , Inheritance is Audrey Assad 's latest triumph . '' Kevin Davis , affixing the album with a four and a half star rating by New Release Today , describes , `` These are truly poignant songs of adoration for the Church . '' Allocating the album five stars at Louder Than the Music , Jono Davies states , `` She has let their vocals and the words of these fantastic hymns do all the work in this release , and this is something that must be commended . '' Chris Major , allotting the album four stars from The Christian Beat , writes , `` Whether familiar with the original hymns or recently introduced , Inheritance is a combination of beautiful , haunting , soothing , and encouraging songs ... As a whole , Inheritance not only pays homage to the legacy of the church 's music , but in and of itself adds to it . '' Reviewing the album for Hallels , Timothy Yap says , `` If you want a hymns album that demonstrates originality , forethought , creativity and an understanding of the different shades of traditions and how they interact with contemporary music , 'Inheritance ' is definitely worth a listen . '' Kelly Meade , rating the album a 4.7 out of five stars at Today ' Christian Entertainment , writes , `` Throughout Inheritance , we hear creative approaches to songs whose lyrics many are familiar with . From the quiet reflectiveness of notes played on a piano to the soaring sounds of string & percussion , the stunning musical display allows the words to shine without overshadowing the glorious message within . '' Granting the album a four and a half star review by The Phantom Tollbooth , Michael Dalton states , `` On Inheritance , Audrey Assad , one of the foremost Catholic artists in our day , infuses ancient texts with a simplicity and wonder that makes them sound timeless . '' Taylor Berglund , reviewing the album for Charisma , writes , `` Fans of the independent Christian singer-songwriter may be disappointed at the lack of original content ; but rest assured that Assad 's alternatingly traditional and unique renditions of hymns creates a refreshing atmosphere of worship ... Though the album peaks early with the first three songs , the rest of Inheritance is still good , particularly for those who appreciate introspective worship ... For Christians looking to create an atmosphere of humble worship , it 's hard to find a better album . '' Giving the album four stars at 365 Days of Inspiring Media , states , `` it is one of the most musically creative , lyrically and thematically compelling , and spiritually sound albums of 2016 so far ... Audrey has definitely done it again ! She 's created a musically brilliant piece of work ... this is well worth the listen ! '' Rob Snyder , grading the album an A from Alpha Omega News , opines , `` Audrey Assad releases one of the best hymns projects since Ashley Cleveland and Bart Millard recorded similar material . ''

Eric Stark Maskin ( born December 12 , 1950 ) is an American economist and mathematician . They were jointly awarded the 2007 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences with Leonid Hurwicz and Roger Myerson `` for having laid the foundations of mechanism design theory '' . They are the Adams University Professor and Professor of Economics and Mathematics at Harvard University .
Until 2011 , they were the Albert O. Hirschman Professor of Social Science at the Institute for Advanced Study , and a visiting lecturer with the rank of professor at Princeton University .
Early life and education
Maskin was born in New York City on December 12 , 1950 , into a Jewish family , and spent their youth in Alpine , New Jersey . They graduated from Tenafly High School in Tenafly , New Jersey , in 1968 . In 1972 , they graduated with A.B . in mathematics from Harvard College , the undergraduate liberal arts college of Harvard University . In 1974 , they earned A.M. in applied mathematics and in 1976 earned a Ph.D. in applied mathematics , both at Harvard University . In 1975-76 , they were a visiting student at Darwin College , Cambridge University .
Career and topics
In 1976 , after earning their doctorate , Maskin became a research fellow at Jesus College , Cambridge University . In the following year , they joined the faculty at Massachusetts Institute of Technology . In 1985 they returned to Harvard as the Louis Berkman Professor of Economics , where they remained until 2000 . That year , they moved to the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton , New Jersey . In addition to their position at the Princeton Institute , Maskin is the director of the Jerusalem Summer School in Economic Theory at The Institute for Advanced Studies at The Hebrew University of Jerusalem . In 2010 , they were conferred an honorary doctoral degree in economics from The University of Cambodia . In 2011 , Maskin returned to Harvard as the Adams University Professor and professor of economics and mathematics .
Maskin has worked in diverse areas of economic theory , such as game theory , the economics of incentives , and contract theory . They are particularly known for their papers on mechanism design/implementation theory and dynamic games . With Jean Tirole , they advanced the concept of Markov perfect equilibrium . Their research projects include comparing different electoral rules , examining the causes of inequality , and studying coalition formation .
Maskin is a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences , Econometric Society , and the European Economic Association , and a Corresponding Fellow of the British Academy . They were president of the Econometric Society in 2003 .

Furthermore , they are the chairperson of the board of trustees of the International Economics Olympiad .
Software patents
Maskin suggested that software patents inhibit innovation rather than stimulate progress . Software , semiconductor , and computer industries have been innovative despite historically weak patent protection , they argued . Innovation in those industries has been sequential and complementary , so competition can increase firms ' future profits . In such a dynamic industry , `` patent protection may reduce overall innovation and social welfare '' . A natural experiment occurred in the 1980s when patent protection was extended to software '' , wrote Maskin with co-author James Bessen . `` Standard arguments would predict that R & D intensity and productivity should have increased among patenting firms . Consistent with our model , however , these increases did not occur '' . Other evidence supporting this model includes a distinctive pattern of cross-licensing and a positive relationship between rates of innovation and firm entry .

Brandi Worley ( born November 10 , 1986 ) is a woman from Darlington , Indiana who murdered their two children on November 17 , 2016 .
Background
The victims were Tyler Daniel Clinton Worley ( born 2009 ) and Charlee Rose Jean Worley ( born 2013 ) . Tyler attended the first grade at Sugar Creek Elementary School in unincorporated Montgomery County , Indiana . Charlee was enrolled in the Willson Early Learning Center preschool in Crawfordsville . They were 7 years old , and they were 3 years old .
Brandi married a software engineer , Jason Worley , in August 2009 , two years after their engagement .
Shannon Hall of the Journal & Courier wrote that , according to Jason , `` The two discussed separating in the past [ ... ] but they stayed together despite some friction . '' On November 15 , 2016 , Jason Worley requested a divorce due to their infidelity . Brandi Worley 's attorney stated that no prior child abuse had occurred .
Murders of Tyler and Charlee Worley
After coming home from the dance performance for their daughter , Charlee , Brandi Worley went to the Walmart in Crawfordsville , Indiana under the pretense of needing to buy pipe cleaners for a school project for their son , Tyler . According to Joseph Buser , a prosecutor in the Montgomery County government , Brandi Worley bought the murder weapon , a Ka-Bar combat knife , at a Walmart on November 16 . Coming home , they initially placed the knife in Tyler 's bedroom .
They told Jason that they could sleep on the couch , but they declined , preferring the basement to their bed or couch .
As Jason slept in the basement of their residence , Brandi lured Tyler to Charlee 's bedroom , stating there would be a sleepover there . They fatally stabbed the children in their necks , and then stabbed themselves in their own neck . Brandi murdered their son before murdering their daughter . The daughter woke to hear the repeated stabbings to their brother and asked , `` What are you doing ? '' In response , Brandi told them to `` go back to sleep . '' They then repeatedly stabbed their daughter . Finally , Brandi called 9-1-1 to report the murders . They stated they had taken `` a lot of Benadryl '' . They told the 911 dispatcher that they had already called their mother and that their mother was on their way over . Them mother had not yet realized the events that had taken place .
The 9-1-1 dispatcher , initially hoping or believing the call was not legitimate , asked Brandi Worley 's mother , who was the victims ' grandmother , to check on the welfare of the children . After the mother-in-law found the children dead , their screams caused Jason to rise out of bed . Brandi told Jason `` Now you ca n't take the kids from me . '' Police arrived around 4:30 A.M .
Autopsies were conducted at Terre Haute Regional Hospital in Terre Haute , Indiana .
Aftermath
Brandi Worley initially was admitted to Indiana University Health Methodist Hospital in Indianapolis to treat their self-inflicted injuries .
The funeral of the victims was held at the Darlington Community Center on November 22 , 2016 , and they were buried at Greenlawn Cemetery in Darlington . A vigil was held at Congregational Christian Church , also in Darlington , on November 18 , 2016 .
YouTuber Philip DeFranco assisted Jason Worley after the father of the victims contacted them on Reddit . DeFranco asked their viewers to contribute to a GoFundMe account to pay for Jason Worley 's immediate cost of living and the funeral of the children .
In March 2017 , the divorce initiated by Jason Worley became final .
Legal proceedings and sentence
Brandi Worley was placed in the Montgomery County Jail in Crawfordsville while they awaited trial .
Originally , Brandi Worley pleaded not guilty and had a trial scheduled . In January 2018 , Brandi Worley pleaded guilty to two counts of murder . On March 19 , 2018 , Judge Harry Siamas of the Montgomery Circuit Court sentenced Brandi Worley to 65 years for murdering Charlee and 55 years for murdering Tyler , giving them a consecutive total of 120 years in prison , a de facto sentence of life in prison . Jason Worley stated `` All I care is to never see [ Brandi Worley ] again . Out of sight and out of mind . ''
Brandi Worley , now in the Indiana Department of Corrections , is located in the Rockville Correctional Facility in Parke County , Indiana .
As of August 2019 , Brandi Worley is in Indiana Women 's Prison in Indianapolis , Indiana .

Cyprididae is `` the most diverse group of freshwater ostracods '' . It contains 1000 species , which represents 50 % of the known species of freshwater ostracods ( other speciose families include Candonidae , with 25 % , and Limnocytheridae , with 10 % ) . Around 60 % of genera in the family are endemic to a single zoogeographic region . The family contains 25 subfamilies , and is most diverse in the Afrotropical realm , with over 300 species in 45 genera . Many Cyprididae occur in temporary water bodies and have drought-resistant eggs , mixed/parthenogenetic reproduction and ability to swim . These biological attributes pre-adapt them to form successful radiations in these habitats . Bennelongia is an interesting genus of the family Cyprididae . It may be the last true descendant genus of the Mesozoic ( and now extinct ) lineage of Cypridea , which was a dominant lineage of ostracod in non-marine waters in the Cretaceous .

Experimental petrology is the field of research concerned with experimentally determining the physical and chemical behavior of rocks and their constituents . Because there is no way to directly observe or measure deep earth processes , geochemists rely on experimental petrology to establish quantitative values and relationships in order to construct models of the deep earth . Experimental petrology can range from creating artificial magmas to measure crystallization behavior to observing recrystallization of minerals at varying pressure/temperature conditions .
Methodology
Although methodology varies from experiment to experiment , in general the procedure involves evaluating a synthetic rock or magma ( created from a blend of oxides to replicate the chemistry of the rock/system in question ) in an apparatus capable of creating and sustaining high pressures and temperatures such as a diamond anvil cell . In general , it is ideal if the enclosing capsule is relatively nonreactive , such as diamond or platinum/gold alloys .
Experimental igneous petrology
Experimental igneous petrology is the subset of experimental petrology concerned with quantifying the behavior of magmas and their associated igneous rocks at depth . Standard procedure generally involves the creation of a synthetic magma ( often corresponding to a real world analog ) which is then cooled to a target temperature . After crystallization , the products are analyzed - qualities of interest include mineral assemblage ( which minerals crystallized and how much ) , mineral chemistry , and liquid ( the remainder of the synthetic magma base ) composition .
Equilibrium crystallization
Equilibrium crystallization studies are those in which a starting liquid is cooled until fully crystalline . This is taken to be the `` equilibrium state '' of the composition under those particular P/T conditions . Criticisms of equilibrium crystallization include the observation that real-world systems are believed to rarely sit still during crystallization and thus would not be able to properly equilibrate .
Fractional crystallization
Fractional crystallization studies represent a fairly recent trend in experimental petrology , gaining popularity as a way to more accurately depict magma evolution in scenarios where a cumulated layer is built . In them , a starting liquid is cooled in small temperature steps ( e.g . 30 °C ) . At each temperature step the contents are removed and analyzed as in equilibrium crystallization . Afterwards , a new liquid corresponding to the residual liquid from the previous step is synthesized , heated , and then subjected to another cooling step . The purpose of this stepwise approach is to examine how each new interval of crystallization affects the chemistry of the parent magma and , thus , the behavior of future crystallization steps . In such a manner it is possible to examine the behavior of a magma body as it slowly cools and crystallizes over time .

Duffield railway station serves the village of Duffield in Derbyshire , England . The station is located on the Midland Main Line from Derby to Leeds , north of London St Pancras . It is also a junction with the former branch line to Wirksworth , which is now operated as the Ecclesbourne Valley heritage railway .
The unmanned station is served by East Midlands Railway , who operate local services from Derby to Matlock via the Derwent Valley Line .
History
The first station at Duffield was built in 1841 , a year after the line opened , by the North Midland Railway a few yards further north from its present position .
From 1840 there had been a number of proposals for a line from Manchester down the Churnet Valley to meet either the Birmingham and Derby Junction Railway or the Midland Counties Railway , and then go on to London . An amendment was put forward in 1844 bringing the line to the North Midland at Duffield , presumably via Ashbourne and the Ecclesbourne Valley . However , the line never materialised .
The Midland Railway , however , was looking for a path into Manchester as an alternative to the former Manchester , Buxton , Matlock and Midlands Junction Railway from Ambergate to Rowsley which it leased jointly with the LNWR . It built a junction at Duffield and began to contruct the line , which opened as far as Wirksworth in 1867 . When the MR gained sole control of the Ambergate line in 1871 , the extension proved unnecessary . However , the Wirksworth branch remained a busy line with a regular passenger service and freight in the form of limestone from Wirksworth and milk from the farms along the line .
In 1867 a large new station was built in the vee of the junction , with platforms on each side of the double track . A signal box was provided to the east of the main line , replaced by Duffield Junction box around 1890 at the south end of Platform One . By this time the population of Duffield had increased with railway workers and management , as had traffic on the main line . In 1897 a goods line was laid in the up ( southbound ) direction , and a fourth , down goods , laid in 1904 .
At this stage there were two platforms with a footbridge , the second being an island between the two passenger lines , and another for the branch . The two subsidiary platforms each had a waiting room , while the main platform building contained the waiting room , ticket and luggage offices . Next to the footbridge was a separate W.H . Smith bookstall . The station master 's house was separate , being beside the track to the north , and there was small luggage store just outside the gate . The Wirksworth branch having severed the main road , which had been diverted , a footbridge gave access across the line . To the north of the station , there was a wide level crossing which , besides allowing luggage trolleys to cross , gave access for the farmer who owned the adjacent land . Next to this was a footbridge from the front of the station to the field behind , and between them two signal posts with , until 1910 , a Duffield Station signal box supplementing Duffield Junction . After that , the station changed little over the years until 1969 though in 1947 , at the time passenger services were withdrawn on the Wirksworth branch , the signal posts were replaced with a fabricated steel gantry and upper-quadrant signals . Some time later the passenger footbridge was rebuilt in brick , using the existing walkway .
In the 1960s the station became unstaffed , and the buildings were removed in 1969 except for the station master 's house which became a private residence , and the small luggage store which was just outside the gate . However these have also subsequently been demolished .
In July 2005 the station was adopted by WyvernRail plc under a scheme promoted by the Friends of the Derwent Valley Line . WyvernRail undertook to provide care and maintenance of Duffield railway station on behalf of Central Trains ( who operated the station at that time ) and continue to do so for East Midlands Railway .

Lethbridge-East is a provincial electoral district in Alberta , Canada , covering the eastern half of the city of Lethbridge . The district is one of 87 in the province mandated to return a single member to the Legislative Assembly of Alberta using the first past the post method of voting .
The electoral district was created in the 1971 boundary redistribution when the old Lethbridge district was split into this district and Lethbridge-West .
The current representative for Lethbridge-East is United Conservative Nathan Neudorf , who won their first term on April 16 , 2019 . Prior to them it was held by New Democrat Maria Fitzpatrick , from 2015-2019 , Liberal-turned-PC Bridget Pastoor from 2004-2015 and Liberal Ken Nicol from 1993-2004 .

USS Ashley ( IX-83 ) was an auxiliary schooner of the United States Navy during World War II .
Built by T. Berlin Albury as Winslow during 1937 at Harbor Island in the Bahamas , the ship was acquired by the Navy from the Adavondach School , Inc. , of Florida , on 29 July 1942 ; renamed Ashley on 4 September 1942 and designated IX-83 that same day ; and placed in service on 11 September 1942 at the section base at Port Everglades , Florida .
Service history
The purpose for which Ashley was acquired and placed in service remains unclear . It is possible that they were to have been used in either the Inshore Patrol or the Coastal Picket Patrol , but nothing definitive is known . They spent their entire , brief Navy career assigned to the 7th Naval District , probably operating from Port Everglades . On 24 March 1943 , they were selected for lay up by the Commandant , 7th Naval District . The date of them being placed out of service has not been found , but their name was struck from the Navy List on 16 November 1943 . On 22 January 1944 , they were loaned to the Merritt-Chapman & Scott Corp. for operation in some unspecified service by a civilian crew . Them ultimate disposition also remains a mystery .

Ma'ale HaHamisha ( , lit . Ascent of the Five ) is a kibbutz in central Israel . Located in the Judean hills just off the Jerusalem–Tel Aviv highway , It falls under the jurisdiction of Mateh Yehuda Regional Council . In it had a population of .
History
The kibbutz was founded by members of the Gordonia youth movement on 19 July 1938 as one of 57 tower and stockade settlements founded almost overnight between 1936 and 1939 in order to establish a permanent Jewish presence in Palestine under the threat of attacks during the Arab revolt . It was named after five men ambushed and killed by Arab gunmen nearby . Ma'ale HaHamisha took in refugees from Gush Etzion in 1949 .
Economy
The kibbutz originally supported itself primarily on agriculture and developed both the Ma'ale HaHamisha cauliflower and peach , as well as gaining income from a hotel . In the early 2000s , the main issue in privatization of the kibbutz was what type of financial and social change could take place . Until then , all sources of income , including German reparations and old age payments , went into the kibbutz kitty , which supplied all necessities , communal and individual . The concept of sliding pay scales for different work — promoted primarily by the younger generation — had to be reconciled with the contributions of the veteran members .
The kibbutz struggled over the fate of community property . Members ' apartments might be individually owned , but over the years , as the older generation remained in smaller units , bigger apartments were built for the younger generation and for a new familial sleeping scheme that had abandoned separate children 's houses . Members also had to decide what to do with the hotel and conference center . It took intervention by an outside arbitrator to reconcile the differences . In January 2005 the kibbutz was privatized .
The main part of the kibbutz 's economy are the Ma'ale HaHamisha Hotel and the Sakoya Events compound .

Luisa Lacalle ( 1880– ? ) , known professionally as Luz Chavita , was a Spanish dancer who gained international fame during the Belle Époque and was a leading dancer in Paris before returning to Spain to become an entrepreneur .
Biography
Luisa Lacalle was born in 1880 in Jerez de la Frontera , Spain to a poor family originally from Seville . Showing promise for dancing at an early age , they began taking dancing classes with Juana la Macarrona . By the time they were fourteen , Lacalle was dancing professionally using the artistic name Lulu or Luz Chavita . Having gained a reputation for their talent , they moved to Paris with a letter for introduction for the Count de Pradere ( also known as Daniel de Carbalho y de Prat ) . Pradere introduced them to Antonin Perivier and , the directors of the newspaper Le Figaro . The pair frequently gave entertainments for aristocratic subscribers and invited Chavita to appear . Almost overnight , they became a sensation and was proclaimed as a new star .
Before their official debut , Chavita studied with Madame Mariquita , where they studied for the next two years . Soon after , they had their official debut at La Scala and from there they went to the Folies Bergère , where they were hired along with Juanita de Frezia , La Belle Gerrero , and Mlle Hernandez , to dance their Spanish repertoire which showed off their décolletage and bare legs . They toured Europe , visiting Berlin , Budapest , London , Vienna and other major cities and then was engaged at El Alcázar in Marseilles . By 1898 , they were among the soloists performing at the Ballet de l'Opéra Comique along with such dancers as Régina Badet , , Jeanne Chasles , Cléo de Mérode and Stacia Napierkowska . The theater soon earned the reputation as the `` most artistic of Paris '' .
At another of Le Figaro′s entertainments in 1899 , Chavita enhanced their fame even more . The newspaper had sided with Alfred Dreyfus and agreed to publish documents which would impact the government handling of the Dreyfus affair . The police planned a raid to confiscate the documents , but when they arrived , Chavita began their performance , delaying the search until the documents could be safely hidden . The story was retold in newspapers ranging from Madrid to the United States . Other noted performances at the Opéra-Comique were their portrayal of Carmen in 1901 and in la Danse au temps de Gavarni ( The Dance in the Time of Gavarni ) in 1903 in which their polka was called exquisite .
Chavita saved all of their earnings , investing them carefully , and announced their retirement from the stage in 1905 . They reconfirmed they were leaving Paris in 1908 and returned to Seville , where they bought real estate on Santa Clara Street , and later another house on Goyonetta Street . They outfitted their homes with modern refinements from Paris , took care of their parents in their old age , and purchased a vineyard in Jerez , which they administered for many years .
Death and legacy
Chavita 's death date is unknown . In 1905 , the ceiling of Paillard Restaurant of Paris , where aristocrats and royalty gathered to dine was painted with a tribute called Women of the Twentieth Century by Lucien-Victor Guirand de Scévola . Chavita 's was one of the likenesses that was included .

In geology and geomorphology a pediplain ( from the Latin pes , genitive case pedis , meaning `` foot '' ) is an extensive plain formed by the coalescence of pediments . The processes through which pediplains forms is known as pediplanation . The concepts of pediplain and pediplanation were first developed by geologist Lester Charles King in their 1942 book South African Scenery . The concept gained notoriety as it was juxtaposed to peneplanation .
The coalesced pediments of the pediplains may form a series of very gentle concave slopes . Pediplains main difference to W. M. Davis ' peneplains is in the history and processes behind , and less so in the final shape . Perhaps the most notable difference in form that may be present is that of residual hills which in Davis ' peneplains are to have gentle slopes while in pediplains they ought to have the same steepness as the slopes in the early stages of erosion leading to pediplanation .
Pediplanation is linked to scarp retreat in the following way : as scarps retreat over geological time pediments migrate and extend over large areas . The result is that the surface is eroded chiefly backward and that downward erosion is limited . In contrast to common peneplain conceptualizations several pediplains might form simultaneously at different altitudes and do not necessarily grade to a base level . Pediplains are normally formed in areas of arid and semi-arid climate . As climate changes arid and semi-arid periods of pediplanation may alternate with more humid periods of etchplanation resulting in the formation of flattish surfaces ( peneplains ) of mixed origin ( polygenetic ) .
Cryoplanation is a variant of pediplanation that is restricted to cold climates .

The Prison Notebooks ( ) were a series of essays written by the Italian Marxist Antonio Gramsci . Gramsci was imprisoned by the Italian Fascist regime in 1926 . The notebooks were written between 1929 and 1935 , when Gramsci was released from prison to a medical center on grounds of ill-health . Their friend , Piero Sraffa , had supplied the writing implements and notebooks . Gramsci died in April 1937 .
They wrote more than 30 notebooks and 3,000 pages of history and analysis during their imprisonment . Although written unsystematically , the Prison Notebooks are considered a highly original contribution to 20th century political theory . Gramsci drew insights from varying sources - not only other Marxists but also thinkers such as Niccolò Machiavelli , Vilfredo Pareto , Georges Sorel and Benedetto Croce . Their notebooks cover a wide range of topics , including Italian history and nationalism , the French Revolution , Fascism , Taylorism and Fordism , civil society , folklore , religion and high and popular culture .
The notebooks were smuggled out of the prison in the 1930s . The first edition was published in 1947 and won the Viareggio Prize a few months later . Gramsci 's posthumous award of the Viareggio Prize was followed by a memorial from the Constituent Assembly of Italy on April 28 , 1947 . The first translation into English was printed in the 1970s , by the Scottish poet and folklorist Hamish Henderson .
Ideas in Marxist theory , critical theory and educational theory that are associated with Gramsci 's name include :
Cultural hegemony as a means of maintaining the capitalist state .
The need for popular workers ' education to encourage development of intellectuals from the working class .
The distinction between political society ( the police , the army , legal system , etc . ) which dominates directly and coercively , and civil society ( the family , the education system , trade unions , etc . ) where leadership is constituted through ideology or by means of consent .
`` Absolute historicism '' .
A critique of economic determinism that opposes fatalistic interpretations of Marxism .
A critique of philosophical materialism .
Hegemony
Hegemony was a concept previously used by Marxists such as Vladimir Ilyich Lenin to indicate the political leadership of the working-class in a democratic revolution , but developed by Gramsci into an acute analysis to explain why the 'inevitable ' socialist revolution predicted by orthodox Marxism had not occurred by the early 20th century . Capitalism , it seemed , was even more entrenched than ever . Capitalism , Gramsci suggested , maintained control not just through violence and political and economic coercion , but also ideologically , through a hegemonic culture in which the values of the bourgeoisie became the 'common sense ' values of all . Thus a consensus culture developed in which people in the working-class identified their own good with the good of the bourgeoisie , and helped to maintain the status quo rather than revolting .
The working class needed to develop a culture of its own , which would overthrow the notion that bourgeois values represented 'natural ' or 'normal ' values for society , and would attract the oppressed and intellectual classes to the cause of the proletariat . Lenin held that culture was 'ancillary ' to political objectives but for Gramsci it was fundamental to the attainment of power that cultural hegemony be achieved first . In Gramsci 's view , any class that wishes to dominate in modern conditions has to move beyond its own narrow ‘ economic-corporate ' interests , to exert intellectual and moral leadership , and to make alliances and compromises with a variety of forces . Gramsci calls this union of social forces a ‘ historic bloc ' , taking a term from Georges Sorel . This bloc forms the basis of consent to a certain social order , which produces and re-produces the hegemony of the dominant class through a nexus of institutions , social relations and ideas . In this manner , Gramsci developed a theory that emphasized the importance of the superstructure in both maintaining and fracturing relations of the base .
Gramsci stated that , in the West , bourgeois cultural values were tied to religion , and therefore much of their polemic against hegemonic culture is aimed at religious norms and values . They were impressed by the power Roman Catholicism had over men 's minds and the care the Church had taken to prevent an excessive gap developing between the religion of the learned and that of the less educated . Gramsci believed that it was Marxism 's task to marry the purely intellectual critique of religion found in Renaissance humanism to the elements of the Reformation that had appealed to the masses . For Gramsci , Marxism could supersede religion only if it met people 's spiritual needs , and to do so people would have to recognize it as an expression of their own experience .
For Gramsci , hegemonic dominance ultimately relied on coercion , and in a `` crisis of authority '' the `` masks of consent '' slip away , revealing the fist of force .
Intellectuals and education
Gramsci gave much thought to the question of the role of intellectuals in society . Famously , they stated that all men are intellectuals , in that all have intellectual and rational faculties , but not all men have the social function of intellectuals . They claimed that modern intellectuals were not simply talkers , but directors and organisers who helped build society and produce hegemony by means of ideological apparatuses such as education and the media . Furthermore , they distinguished between a 'traditional ' intelligentsia which sees itself ( wrongly ) as a class apart from society , and the thinking groups which every class produces from its own ranks 'organically ' . Such 'organic ' intellectuals do not simply describe social life in accordance with scientific rules , but rather articulate , through the language of culture , the feelings and experiences which the masses could not express for themselves . The need to create a working-class culture relates to Gramsci 's call for a kind of education that could develop working-class intellectuals , who would not simply introduce Marxist ideology from outside the proletariat , but rather renovate and make critical the status quo of the already existing intellectual activity of the masses . Their ideas about an education system for this purpose correspond with the notion of critical pedagogy and popular education as theorized and practised in later decades by Paulo Freire in Brazil , and have much in common with the thought of Frantz Fanon . For this reason , partisans of adult and popular education consider Gramsci an important voice to this day .
State and civil society
Gramsci 's theory of hegemony is tied to their conception of the capitalist state , which they claim rules through force plus consent . The state is not to be understood in the narrow sense of the government ; instead , Gramsci divides it between 'political society ' , which is the arena of political institutions and legal constitutional control , and 'civil society ' , which is commonly seen as the 'private ' or 'non-state ' sphere , differentiated from both the state and the economy . The former is the realm of force and the latter of consent . They stress , however , that the division is purely conceptual and that the two , in reality , often overlap .
Gramsci claims that hegemony lies under modern capitalism and that the bourgeoisie can maintain its economic control by allowing certain demands made by trade unions and mass political parties within civil society to be met by the political sphere . Thus , the bourgeoisie engages in Passive Revolution by going beyond its immediate economic interests and allowing the forms of its hegemony to change . Gramsci posits that movements such as reformism and fascism , as well as the 'scientific management ' and assembly line methods of Frederick Taylor and Henry Ford respectively , are examples of this .
Drawing from Machiavelli , they argue that 'The Modern Prince ' – the revolutionary party – is the force that will allow the working-class to develop organic intellectuals and an alternative hegemony within civil society . For Gramsci , the complex nature of modern civil society means that the only tactic capable of undermining bourgeois hegemony and leading to socialism is a 'war of position ' ( analogous to trench warfare ) ; this war of position would then give way to a 'war of movement ' ( or frontal attack ) . Gramsci saw 'war of movement ' as being exemplified by the storming of the Winter Palace during the Russian Revolution .
Despite their claim that the lines between the two may be blurred , Gramsci rejects the state-worship that results from identifying political society with civil society , as was done by the Jacobins and Fascists . They believe the proletariat 's historical task is to create a 'regulated society ' and defines the 'withering away of the state ' as the full development of civil society 's ability to regulate itself .
Historicism
Gramsci , like the early Marx , was an emphatic proponent of historicism . In Gramsci 's view , all meaning derives from the relation between human practical activity ( or `` praxis '' ) and the `` objective '' historical and social processes of which it is a part . Ideas can not be understood outside their social and historical context , apart from their function and origin . The concepts by which we organise our knowledge of the world do not derive primarily from our relation to things , but rather from the social relations between the users of those concepts . As a result , there is no such thing as an unchanging `` human nature '' , but only an idea of such which varies historically . Furthermore , philosophy and science do not `` reflect '' a reality independent of man , but rather are only `` true '' in that they express the real developmental trend of a given historical situation .
For the majority of Marxists , truth was truth no matter when and where it is known , and scientific knowledge ( which included Marxism ) accumulated historically as the advance of truth in this everyday sense . On this view , Marxism does not belong to the illusory realm of the superstructure because it is a science . In contrast , Gramsci believed Marxism was `` true '' in the socially pragmatic sense , in that by articulating the class consciousness of the proletariat , it expressed the `` truth '' of its times better than any other theory . This anti-scientistic and anti-positivist stance was indebted to the influence of Benedetto Croce . However , Gramsci 's `` historicism '' was an `` absolute historicism '' that broke with the Hegelian and idealist tenor of Croce 's thinking and its tendency to secure a metaphysical synthesis in historical `` destiny '' . Though Gramsci repudiated the charge , their historical account of truth has been criticised as a form of relativism .
Critique of `` economism ''
In a famous pre-prison article entitled `` The Revolution against Das Kapital '' , Gramsci claimed that the October Revolution in Russia had invalidated the idea that socialist revolution had to await the full development of capitalist forces of production . This reflected their view that Marxism was not a determinist philosophy . The principle of the causal `` primacy '' of the forces of production , they held , was a misconception of Marxism . Both economic changes and cultural changes are expressions of a `` basic historical process '' , and it is difficult to say which sphere has primacy over the other . The fatalistic belief , widespread within the workers ' movement in its earliest years , that it would inevitably triumph due to `` historical laws '' , was , in Gramsci 's view , a product of the historical circumstances of an oppressed class restricted mainly to defensive action , and was to be abandoned as a hindrance once the working-class became able to take the initiative . Because Marxism is a `` philosophy of praxis '' , it can not rely on unseen `` historical laws '' as the agents of social change . History is defined by human praxis and therefore includes human will . Nonetheless , will-power can not achieve anything it likes in any given situation : when the consciousness of the working-class reaches the stage of development necessary for action , historical circumstances will be encountered which can not be arbitrarily altered . It is not , however , predetermined by historical inevitability as to which of several possible developments will take place as a result .
Their critique of economism also extended to that practised by the syndicalists of the Italian trade unions . They believed that many trade unionists had settled for a reformist , gradualist approach in that they had refused to struggle on the political front in addition to the economic front . While Gramsci envisioned the trade unions as one organ of a counter-hegemonic force in capitalist society , the trade union leaders simply saw these organizations as a means to improve conditions within the existing structure . Gramsci referred to the views of these trade unionists as `` vulgar economism '' , which they equated to covert reformism and even liberalism .
Critique of materialism
By virtue of their belief that human history and collective praxis determine whether any philosophical question is meaningful or not , Gramsci 's views run contrary to the metaphysical materialism and 'copy ' theory of perception advanced by Engels and Lenin , though they do not explicitly state this . For Gramsci , Marxism does not deal with a reality that exists in and for itself , independent of humanity . The concept of an objective universe outside of human history and human praxis was , in their view , analogous to belief in God ; there could be no objectivity , but only a universal intersubjectivity to be established in a future communist society . Natural history was thus only meaningful in relation to human history . On their view philosophical materialism , like primitive common sense , resulted from a lack of critical thought , and could not , as Lenin claimed , be said to oppose religious superstition . Despite this , Gramsci resigned themselves to the existence of this arguably cruder form of Marxism : the proletariat 's status as a dependent class meant that Marxism , as its philosophy , could often only be expressed in the form of popular superstition and common sense . Nonetheless , it was necessary to effectively challenge the ideologies of the educated classes , and to do so Marxists must present their philosophy in a more sophisticated guise , and attempt to genuinely understand their opponents ' views .

Homarus morrisi is a species of fossil lobster from the Eocene of southern England .
Taxonomy
Specimens of H. morrisi were described as early as 1849 , but were assigned to Hoploparia gammaroides rather than Homarus by scientists that included Frederick M'Coy and Thomas Bell . In 1987 , W. J. Quayle recognised that the material then ascribed to Hoploparia gammaroides represented two species , and described the new species Homarus morrisi for those that did n't match the description of Hoploparia gammaroides . The specific epithet honours S. F. Morris of the Department of Palaeontology at the `` British Museum ( Natural History ) '' ( now the Natural History Museum ) .
Stratigraphy
Homarus morrisi has been found at a range of sites across Southern England . It occurs in the Ypresian London Clay at Bognor Regis , the Isle of Sheppey , London and sites across Essex , the Ypresian–Lutetian Bracklesham Group at Bracklesham Bay , Selsey and Whitecliff Bay ( Isle of Wight ) , and in the Bartonian Barton Beds of Christchurch Bay , Hampshire .

Miniature Lop is a breed of domestic rabbit recognised by the British Rabbit Council ( BRC ) . Confusion arises because , in the UK , the Miniature Lop is often commonly called ( for short ) the Mini Lop . It is , however , a different breed from the Mini Lop that is recognized by the American Rabbit Breeders Association ( ARBA ) . The BRC-recognized Miniature Lop is most similar to the ARBA-recognized Holland Lop . The Miniature Lop is also similar to several other small rabbit breeds .
History
The Miniature Lop in Britain is a relatively new rabbit breed , and it is descended from the first dwarf lops that were developed in the Netherlands during the 1970s . These are now called , in the US , the Holland Lop , but in the Netherlands , they are known as the Miniature Lop .
A Dutch rabbit breeder , Adriann de Cock , is generally credited with developing in late 1949 the dwarf lop breeds , by crossing the French Lop ( one of the largest of to lop breeds ) with the tiny Netherland Dwarf . Years of hard work paid off to produce the smallest of to lop breeds , and Holland Lops of approximately were first shown in 1964 .
In 1970 , the Holland Lop breed society , composed of 12 breeders in the Netherlands , was established by Adriann de Cock , with the aim of breeding Holland Lops down to . Ten years later , these smaller Holland Lops were imported to Britain by George Scott of Yorkshire via a Dutch contact . After years of selective breeding among the smallest specimens , a new breed was developed and named the Miniature Lop , which was recognised by the British Rabbit Council in 1994 , with a maximum weight of .
Weight
Females usually grow larger than the male .
Appearance
Coat - The coat to be dense and of good length , rollback with an abundance of
guard hairs . Legs and pads to be well furred .
Head , Crown and Eyes - The head is bold , broad and well developed . The
profile of the head is strongly curved with a good width between the eyes , full
cheeks and a broad muzzle .
The eyes are bold , bright and large . The basal ridge of the ears should appear
prominent across the top of the skull to form the crown .
Ears - Should be broad , thick , well furred and rounded at the ends . They
should be carried close to the cheeks giving a horseshoe like outline when
viewed from the front . The inside of the ears should not be visible from any
angle when carried correctly .
Color
Agouti , Black , Blue , Brown , Butterfly , Chinchilla , Fawn , Fox , Opal , Orange , Sable Marten , Sealpoint , Siamese Sable , Siamese Smoke , Sooty Fawn , Steel , White
Lifespan
The expected lifespan of this rabbit is between 7-14 years , but they can live up to 18 years if properly cared for .

The Defence Fire and Rescue Service ( DFRS ) is the primary firefighting and rescue service protecting British defence estates and property . Along with the Royal Air Force Rescue and Firefighting Service , it forms the Ministry of Defence Fire Services . , the takeover of DFRS by private contractor Capita continues .
History
The Ministry of Defence Fire Service was formed on 1 April 1991 by the amalgamation of the Navy Department Fire Prevention Service , Army Department Fire Service , Air Force Department Fire Service and Procurement Executive Fire Service . It later became part of a similarly named umbrella body , the Ministry of Defence Fire Services , which also included the RAF Firefighting and Rescue Service , a military organisation which protected mainly RAF airfields and runways .
Privatisation
In July 2019 , it was announced by the Ministry of Defence that Capita had won an outsourcing contract to manage the operations at 53 sites across the UK , Cyprus and the Falkland Islands . Part of the 12-year £525million contract included the construction and management of an improved training facility for Defence firefighters at the Fire Service College in Gloucestershire ,
which has been owned by Capita since 2013 .
, around 600 DFRS personnel have transferred into Capita Fire and Rescue , and improvements at the Fire Service College have been completed .
In addition , 50 new vehicles including Oshkosh High Reach Extendable Turret ( HRET ) Strikers and Angloco Multi-Purpose Response Vehicles ( MPRVs ) have been delivered to 11 sites .
Organisation
The Defence Fire and Rescue Service is a civilian organisation , however the term 'Defence Fire ' may be used colloquially to include military and civilian firefighting activities .
According to the gov.uk website , the DFR staff include :
Military
Royal Air Force Trade Group 8 firefighter
Royal Navy aircraft handler
Civilian
Civil Service ( Defence Fire and Rescue Service )
locally employed civilian and contractor staff .
As DFR is a mixture of people , recruitment and conditions differ , but for civilians wishing to join , they would become civil servants and thus to apply would need to apply via the Civil Service website .

Mythbuntu is a discontinued media center operating system based on Ubuntu , which integrated the MythTV media center software as its main function , and did not install with all of the programs included with Ubuntu .
Following the principles of fellow Linux distributions LinHES and MythDora , Mythbuntu was designed to simplify the installation of MythTV on a home theater PC . After Mythbuntu had been installed the MythTV setup program begins in which it can be configured as a frontend ( a media viewer ) , backend ( a media server ) , or combination of the two .
Mythbuntu aimed to keep close ties with Ubuntu thus allowing changes to be moved upstream for the greater benefit of the Ubuntu Community . Due to the close link with Ubuntu , easy conversions between desktop and standalone Mythbuntu installations are possible . The development cycle of Mythbuntu originally followed that of Ubuntu , with releases occurring every six months . Starting with 12.04 , Mythbuntu releases tracked Ubuntu 's LTS ( long-term support ) releases , which release approximately every two years .
On 4 November 2016 the development team announced the end of Mythbuntu as a separate distribution , citing insufficient developers . The team will continue to maintain the Mythbuntu software repository ; the announcement advised new users to install another Ubuntu distribution , then install MythTV from the repository .
Desktop
Mythbuntu uses the Xfce desktop interface by default , but users can install ubuntu-desktop , kubuntu-desktop , or xubuntu-desktop through the Mythbuntu Control Centre , allowing users to get the default interfaces from those flavors of Ubuntu . The only software that is included in this release is media-related software such as VLC , Amunix , and Rhythmbox .
Mythbuntu Control Centre
The Mythbuntu Control Centre provides a GUI which can be used to configure the system . The user can select what kind of system ( Backend , Frontend , Both ) they wish to have installed . Inside the Control Centre , the user can perform common actions such as installing plugins for MythTV , configuring the MySQL database , setting passwords , and installing drivers and codecs . MythTV updates can be enabled here as well as switching to the latest release version or development branch of MythTV . Configuration of remote controls and a range of other utilities and small programs are performed all from within this program .
Different applications of Mythbuntu
Complete installation ( front-end and back-end )
Mythbuntu can be used to install a full MythTV system on a single device ( acting as both a client and a server ) . The front-end is the software required for the visual elements ( or the GUI ) and is utilised by the common user to find , play , and manipulate media files . The back end is the server where the media files , tuners , and database are actually stored . A combined front-and-back-end system may have an advantage in that it has portability : it is a standalone device that is not dependent on a separate server , such as a gaming console .
Front-end-only installations
Alternatively , Mythbuntu can be used to install a MythTV client : a front-end-only system . This might be useful where users already have a central storage server in their home . The central storage device can act as a MythTV server , and the MythTV front-end client software can be installed on devices with low-power hardware . Mythbuntu can also run directly from a CD-ROM ( without installation ) , provided that there is a network connection to a PC with a MythTV back-end server .
Using a server separate from one or more front-end units offers the ability to use multiple clients with simultaneous access to a single repository of shared media files . The server used would generally have hardware of a relatively high specification and can be kept outside of the main living room or other entertainment area of the home . Another advantage is the ability to move some of the potentially noisy hardware out of the living room , as low-noise , high-performance hardware can be expensive .
Adding Mythbuntu to Ubuntu
Mythbuntu is an Ubuntu derivative that offers an easy single-click conversion from Ubuntu to Mythbuntu . This means a user no longer needs to type in command line , which can be daunting to new users , or hunt for packages in the various package managers .

Line 5 is a north–south rapid transit line of the Shanghai Metro network , running from station in Minhang District in the north to in Fengxian District was originally planned as the Minhang and Fengxian sections of line 1 extending south to Minhang . Despite its numeric designation , it was the fourth Shanghai Metro line to enter passenger service , opening on 25 November 2003 . The line is colored violet on system maps .
History
Line 5 was originally built under the direction of Minhang District and remains the only line in Shanghai Metro system that was originally built under the supervision of a county-level government .
In 1998 , Minhang District authorities signed a contract with Shanghai Jiushi Group to build the line . In 2000 , Shanghai Jiushi Group signed a contract between Alstom to purchase trains and started its construction . In 2002 , Shanghai Modern Rail Transit Incorporated , a subsidiary of former , was given management of the line . The line entered passenger operations on 25 November 2003 , on an initial segment between and stations , entirely within Minhang District .
Prior to integration with the rest of the Shanghai Metro network , it used its own ticketing system . In 2005 , it was integrated with Shanghai Metro 's ticketing system , which enabled an in-station interchange to line 1 at Xinzhuang station . At the same time , management and operation of the line was taken over by Shanghai No . 1 Metro Operation Co. Ltd .
Phase II extension and renovation
Phase two of the line , which would extend the line further south into Fengxian District , began construction on 30 July 2014 . On 1 April 2015 , a feasibility study for the extending of line 5 platforms , upgrading signals to support the use of higher-capacity six-car trains and renovation of tail tracks at was approved . Due to these system upgrades , service on the existing line was cut back from station to on 20 August 2018 . Full service was restored on 20 October 2018 . At the same time , the line began to operate as two separate services , being split at station , due to the anticipated opening of the phase two extension of line 5 , which would create two branches of the line . Six-car trains began to run on the service between Xinzhuang and Dongchuan Road station . Passengers wishing to travel the entire length of the line needed to interchange at Dongchuan Road station .
On 30 December 2018 , the extension from Dongchuan Road station to station opened , becoming the first Shanghai Metro line to provide access to Fengxian District . The extension crosses the Huangpu River using the Minpu Second Bridge , the first Shanghai Metro line which crosses the river by bridge . The total length of the extension is in length , with underground and the remainder being elevated . As a result of the extension , the segment of line 5 between Dongchuan Road and Minhang Development Zone stations was designated as a branch service , while the main service ran from Xinzhuang to Fengxian Xincheng stations . The branch line was operated as a separate service from the main line , thus still necessitating a transfer at Dongchuan Road station . This was due to the fact that four-car trains ran on the branch service , while six-car trains ran on the main line . This arrangement ended on 26 December 2020 , now service on the branch line continues straight through to Xinzhuang With four-car trains from the branch line and six-car trains from the mainline running in mixed operation in the joint section between Xinzhuang and Dongchuan Road stations . Additionally , the fare system of the line reverted to a pricing similar to other Shanghai Metro Lines .
Controversy
During the trial operation of the southern extension section Shanghai Metro received complaints from residents of Pujiang Building on noise . In order to effectively control the impact of the noise caused by the train operation , on the premise of not affecting the overall capacity of line 5 , a speed limit of 20 km/h was implemented between Station and Station .

Future expansion
There is currently a reserved and unopened station on the phase two extension of the line , which would be named station , located south of the current terminus at Fengxian Xincheng station . A further expansion of the second phase may see the line extended further south via Nanqiao town , Zhelin town to Haiwan town .
The branch line between Dongchuan Road and Minhang Development Zone stations is expected to be replaced by Line 23 , entirely underground , running to Shanghai Indoor Stadium station . Line 23 is expected to extend west from to on the Jinshan line .
A north extension was planned to . Plans have been abandoned as this extension is now part of the under construction Jiamin line .

Technology
Signalling
Between 2014 and 2018 the signalling system of line 5 has been updated from the Siemens ZUB 200 to Thales SEC Transport TSTCBTC®2.0 ( also deployed on Line 14 ) . It is a unique dual CBTC system that features full redundancy and allows higher level of availability . This is China 's first metro line that was deployed with a dual CBTC system .
Shanghai Metro line 5 is China 's first metro line where operation , renovation and construction were fulfilled at the same time . The project consisted of resignaling and expanding platforms of the existing section and adding a new south extension . To ensure no interruption to normal service , all the resignalling and commissioning was conducted in only a few hours during the night . Both before and after the commissioning , a switchover was made between the old and the new signaling system to ensure normal operation on the next day . After over 500 days , and more than 1,000 switchovers , line 5 had a seamless cutover to the new signalling system with no interruption to normal service at the end of 2018 .
Rolling stock
In 2017 , Alstom has modernised 68 metro cars ( 05C01 ) in service on the Shanghai metro line 5 and to supplied traction and train control management systems for 198 new metro cars due to circulate on the existing line and its extension for 46 million euros . Alstom had modernised the 68 metro cars that it supplied in 2003 with its Chinese joint venture SATCO ( Shanghai Alstom Transport Co. Ltd. ) . The modernisation will increase the reliability of the cars and adapt them to a new signalling system that will be implemented on the line . Alstom supplied traction systems for 198 new cars that have been ordered for the line and its extension . All traction drives were manufactured by Alstom 's joint venture SATEE ( Shanghai Alstom Transport Electrical Equipment Co. Ltd. ) .
The designed speed of the train is 80 km/h , the length ( Type A carriages are longer at 23 meters ) is 19.49 meters ( Tc ) /19.44 meters ( Mp , M ) , and the width ( Type A carriages are wider at 3.0 meters ) is 2.6 meters . It is a VVVF AC drive and has a design life of 30 years . Set 05C01 has 4 carriages with 172 seats which could accommodate 1170 people ( compared to a six carriage Type A car which can accommodate 1860 people which is 60 % higher than a four carriage Type C car ) .

KANA Software , Inc. is a wholly owned subsidiary of Verint Systems ( NASDAQ : VRNT ) and provides on-premises and cloud computing hosted customer relationship management software products to many of the Fortune 500 , mid-market businesses and government agencies .
History
Mark Gainey founded KANA , named after a rescued Shepherd-Husky mix , in 1996 . The purpose was to market a software package designed to help businesses manage email and Web-based communications . It grew around this core offering .
In 1999 , KANA Communications ( as it was then known ) acquired Connectify followed by Business Evolution and NetDialog .
In 2000 , KANA made its then-largest acquisition , Silknet Software . The purchase price was $ 4.2 billion , despite the fact that both companies were relatively small . Silknet was an early multichannel marketing software company . Industry analysts were generally cool to the purchase though some said it made sense strategically .
In 2001 , KANA merged with BroadBase software . KANA was a major stock market success during the dot-com bubble , and while it contracted significantly during the following downturn , it remained in business as an independent company through the following decade .
In 2010 , Accel-KKR acquired KANA 's assets and liabilities for approximately $ 40.82 million . The same year , KANA acquired Lagan Technologies , a government-to-citizen customer relationship management company based in Northern Ireland . The software was rebranded as LAGAN Enterprise , a package that compiles information from sources such as 311 calls and map overlays to improve resource management .
In 2011 , KANA purchased Overtone , which allowed companies to monitor social media outlets like Facebook , Twitter and LinkedIn . The software was rebranded as KANA Experience Analytics .
In 2012 , KANA bought Trinicom , a Dutch company that makes mid-market customer service multichannel ecommerce , especially in the BeNeLux region . Less than three months later , KANA purchased Sword Ciboodle , a company that specializes in contact center software . Industry analysts generally looked favorably on the acquisition ; Ciboodle 's established business process management gave KANA products for a full-featured CRM package for customer service with social media marketing . `` Between the two companies , almost every aspect of customer relationship experience ... is covered . '' The combined organization operates under the KANA brand . Ciboodle 's CEO , Mike Hughes , who had led the company prior to its purchase by Sword , left the company after KANA 's purchase was finalized . They were replaced by KANA executives .
In 2013 , KANA announced the KANA Enterprise product which the company marketed as `` a unified platform supporting both agent-based and customer self-service scenarios '' .
In 2014 , Verint acquired the operating assets of KANA for $ 514 million .

REMP , or Renewable Energy Mitigation Program , is a model of promoting renewable energy through local government building codes that was launched in Colorado in 2000 .
Overview
REMP is a system that encourages the installation of renewable energy systems in partnership with local government agencies . It was launched in the City of Aspen and Pitkin County in 2000 , the first of its kind in the world . Under a REMP program , homeowners who build very energy-consumptive houses , add on to their existing house to render it very energy-consumptive , or install exterior energy use systems must mitigate their energy use . Proper mitigation methods include installing home renewable energy systems to produce their own power or pay into a fund that is later distributed to fund other energy-efficiency projects .
Basics
REMP programs operate under municipalities and counties that have adopted an efficient building code . Included in the code is a section mandating that new buildings—or additions onto existing buildings—must meet certain efficiency requirements . If buildings do not meet that code , they must then mitigate their energy use . Options for mitigation are to install on-site renewable energy systems , such as photovoltaics , solar hot water , a geothermal heat pump , microhydro , or small scale wind power , or to pay into a REMP fund . An appointed nonprofit or other organization flight attendants the REMP fund and applies it to financing other local energy efficiency projects .
Commercial REMP
As of January 2010 , Aspen and Pitkin County 's REMP program now applies to new commercial developments as well as residential construction .
History
Aspen , Colorado
The first REMP program was established in 2000 by the City of Aspen and Pitkin County , Colorado , U.S.A . In January 2000 , the Pitkin County Commissioners and Aspen City Council approved the REMP . The program assesses fees on new homes that exceed the energy budget established by the Aspen/Pitkin Energy Code . REMP fees are collected by the Community Development Department when building permits are issued . The money is held by the City of Aspen 's Finance Department until the Board of County Commissioners and City Council approve a REMP spending proposal . These proposals are developed by the Community Office of Resource Efficiency ( CORE ) , a local nonprofit organization . CORE 's board of directors includes representatives from throughout the county , from the local utilities , and the local transportation authority . As of 2009 , Aspen/Pitkin REMP and CORE have generated over six million dollars to distribute through energy-efficiency grants and rebates .
Generally , in Aspen , houses that exceed must pay $ 5,000 or install on-site renewables , and houses over must pay $ 10,000 or install on-site renewables .
Also , in Aspen , outdoor energy consuming devices are very common . The majority of REMP funding comes from heated snowmelt driveways .
Replications
The REMP model is very replicable and has been applied to a number of locales : Snowmass Village , Basalt , Colorado , Carbondale , Colorado , Eagle County , Colorado , and Martha 's Vineyard .
Martha 's Vineyard
Martha 's Vineyard enacted their own energy-efficient building code , VineyardBuild , modeled after Aspen 's and Carbondale 's .
Eagle County , Colorado
Eagle County 's new energy-efficient building code , ECOBuild is another points-based code checklist , requiring homeowners to build within a certain energy budget .

`` Egomania '' was the first episode of a three-part documentary series on Channel 4 made by Firecracker Films about people who are diagnosed with narcissistic personality disorder ( NPD ) . The other two parts of the series , called Mania , were called `` Pyromania '' and `` Erotomania '' . The film was directed by Mark Soldinger and narrated by actor Bernard Hill .
The film was not well received by some critics . Sam Wollaston from The Guardian referred to it as `` an excuse to show some really nasty people and their behaviour on the television '' . Though they do feel the documentary improves towards the end : `` When a contributor who has featured throughout , Sam Vaknin , reveals that they are a sufferer . And then we get to see them in action , the out-takes of the making of the film ... swaggers around Camden Market in London , shouting at people , demanding money , as if they own the place . Well , they do , so maybe it 's OK. '' However , Wollaston notes : `` And anyway , Frank only displays three of the nine symptoms of narcissistic personality disorder ( NPD ) , so he 's not even a proper egomaniac . ''

Mercado a Termino de Buenos Aires - MATBA - is the Buenos Aires Futures and Options Exchange .
History
MATba was founded in 1907 . It was the first market to be established in Latin America . In its early history , it traded futures contracts on agricultural commodities and rapidly became one of the main grain markets in the world . In the 1920s , MATba 's flaxseed price was the setting price for the flaxseed business worldwide . During the following decades , Argentina 's economic measures led to a decline in the volume of transactions . In the 1990s , MATba got authorization to settle all transactions in US dollars and introduced options on futures contracts . In 1998 , to better meet the needs of its members , MATba launched its electronic trading system , which has been upgraded several times , thus creating greater opportunities for the entire marketplace , and increased access to MATba products .
Products
MATba is the largest agricultural futures & options exchange in South America . It trades futures ( contract size 100 metric tons ) and options ( American style ) . Traded products include soybean , wheat , corn , sunflower , sorghum , barley , soybean oil and ICA MATba ( Argentine Commodities Index ) . The latter is an index that comprises the market value of a portfolio selected according to the product 's market share of the total MATba transactions .
In 2012 Chicago Soybeans and Chicago Corn were launched after MATba signed an agreement with the CME Group to list their contracts on agricultural commodities .
In January 2017 MATba signed an agreement with ROFEX to interconnect their trading platforms so members of both exchanges could trade all the products listed at both Exchanges . Later that year , cattle and `` mini '' contracts on wheat , soybeans and corn were launched .
In October 2018 MATba and Rofex started a merger process .

James Johnstone ( 1719 – c. 1791 ) , also known as Chevalier de Johnstone or Johnstone de Moffatt , was the son of an Edinburgh merchant . They escaped to France after participating in the 1745 Rising ; in 1750 , they were commissioned in the colonial army and served in French North America .
Their military career was undistinguished and they remained a Lieutenant after ten years of service . Following the loss of Quebec in 1760 , they returned to France and left the army . There are few details on their later life and they are thought to have died sometime after 1791 .
They are best remembered for their Memoirs of the rebellion in 1745 and 1746 , first published in 1820 .
Life
James Johnstone was born 25 July 1719 , only son of Jeremy Boone Johnstone , an Edinburgh merchant ; their mother was a distant relative of Lady Jane ( or Jean ) Douglas ( ca 1698-1753 ) , later the centre of a famous inheritance case known as the Douglas Cause .
They had two sisters ; the elder , Cecilia ( ca 1715-1746 ) , married John Rollo ( 1708-1783 ) , later 6th Lord Rollo . Their other sister Jean married Hugh Leslie of Dalkeith and their great-grandson purchased Johnstone 's manuscripts in 1870 .
There is no record of Johnstone ever marrying or having children .
Career
There are few details of Johnstone 's early life , apart from those given in their autobiography but they admit to being a poor student , 'given to dissipation and extravagance . ' They had a difficult relationship with their father , but was indulged by their mother and Lady Jane , who lent them money .
In 1738 , they persuaded their father to send them to Saint Petersburg , where they stayed with their mother 's uncle , James Hewitt , an expatriate Scot and merchant . Another uncle , Gustav Otto Douglas ( 1687-1771 ) , was a Russian general , who was born in Sweden , then changed sides after being captured at Poltava in 1709 . Douglas arranged a commission for Johnstone in the Russian military but their father threatened to disinherit them if they accepted and after a period in London , they returned to Edinburgh in 1740 .
Their sister 's marriage into the Rollo family connected Johnstone to the small circle of Jacobite gentry in Perthshire that supplied over 20 % of the rebel army in the 1745 Rising . Robert , 4th Lord Rollo ( 1679-1758 ) participated in the 1715 Rising , although their son Andrew Rollo ( 1703-1765 ) served with the British army in Flanders during the War of the Austrian Succession .
Johnstone joined the Jacobites when they reached Perth in early September 1745 and was appointed captain in the Duke of Perth 's regiment . Although their claim to have been aide-de-camp to Lord George Murray can not be verified , they were present throughout the campaign , including the invasion of England . Perth ordered them to join the garrison left at Carlisle in December but they refused , saying they 'would never be a victim by choice . ' At Culloden in April 1746 , they allegedly took part in the attack on the government lines , before escaping by taking someone else 's horse .
They made their way to Ruthven Barracks along with around 1,500 other survivors ; on 20 April , Charles ordered them to disperse until they returned from France with additional support . Johnstone accompanied Lord Ogilvy to Clova in Angus , then spent several weeks hiding in the Highlands , before reaching Edinburgh , where their old friend Lady Jane Douglas helped them escape to London . They record watching members of the Jacobite Manchester Regiment being taken to Kennington Common for their execution on 30 July 1746 . Disguised as one of Lady Jane 's servants , they eventually arrived in the Dutch city of The Hague , where they parted .
Although they had originally intended to return to Russia , Johnstone stayed in Paris until Prince Charles was expelled from France after the 1748 Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle . In 1750 , a connection to the Marquis de Puisieulx , then French Foreign Minister led to their appointment as ensign in the Compagnies Franches de la Marine . These were regular troops raised for service in French North America and Johnstone was posted to Île-Royale , Nova Scotia . A recurring theme of their Memoirs are complaints of unfair treatment and they considered this rank an insult ; however , they arrived in Louisbourg and was promoted Lieutenant in 1754 .
The colonial dispute between Britain and France or the French and Indian War began in 1754 , two years before the better known global conflict called the Seven Years ' War . When the British captured Louisbourg in June 1758 , Johnstone was stationed on Prince Edward Island and escaped to Quebec . They served under Montcalm , commander at Quebec until their death on 13 September in the Battle of the Plains of Abraham ; despite being recognised by the British as a Scot , they were allowed to return to France in October 1760 .
The loss of North America resulted in the disbandment of the Compagnies ; Johnstone was paid a small pension and appointed to the Order of Saint Louis in 1762 . Although the Memoirs often refer to their preference for a military life , their career was undistinguished and it ended here . There are few details of their life thereafter ; they apparently visited Scotland in 1779 but seems to have had little contact with their family . The parlous state of French government finances resulted in their pension being reduced in the 1770s ; it was stopped completely following the 1789 French Revolution but later restored .
While it is generally agreed they died in Paris , the date is uncertain ; the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography suggests circa 1800 . There is no record of them after 1791 , which is used by the Dictionary of Canadian Biography and other sources .
Johnstone reportedly deposited their manuscripts in the Scots College , Paris , including Memoirs of the rebellion in 1745-46 , translated into English and published in 1822 . While full of complaints about the injustice of the world and often extremely self-centred , they are lively and include the occasional flash of insight . Like many , they disliked Prince Charles but although an admirer of Lord George Murray , they recorded their talents were offset by a quick temper , arrogance and inability to take advice .
Other works dealing with their time in Canada were printed in Quebec in 1887 ; The Campaign of 1760 in Canada and A dialogue in Hades : a parallel of military errors , of which the French and English armies were guilty , during the campaign of 1759 , in Canada .

The Jeep scandal of 1948 was the first major corruption case in the Republic of India . V.K . Krishna Menon , the Indian High Commissioner to the United Kingdom , ignored protocols and signed a Rs 80 lakh contract for the purchase of army jeeps with a foreign firm .
Purchase
With the Indo-Pakistani War of 1947–1948 ongoing , the Indian Army required more jeeps against the Pakistani Army . V. K. Krishna Menon , the Indian High Commissioner to Britain , placed an order for 2,000 refurbished Jeeps for the same price of new Jeeps that could be purchased from the United States or Canada . They argued that they would be delivered immediately with spare parts . The company assigned to deliver the Jeeps , the little-known Anti-Mistantes , had a capital of only £605 . Krishna Menon agreed to pay $ 172,000 , with 65 % of the total payment upfront without any inspection certificate . They also agreed that only 10 % of the Jeeps would be inspected . The earlier contract stipulated that 65 % of the payment would be made upon inspection , 20 % on delivery and the rest a month after delivery . Of the 155 Jeeps that arrived , none could be placed into service . The Defence Ministry refused to accept them , and Anti-Mistantes suspended delivery of the Jeeps . Menon , unable to contact it , entered an agreement with S.C.K . Agencies for 1,007 jeeps , with 68 being delivered monthly and the Indian government to be compensated for its loss from the older contract . Each jeep cost £458.10 while Anti-Mistantes sold a jeep for £300 . Menon agreed to change the contract to stipulate that 12 jeeps would be delivered monthly for six months and then 120 jeeps would be delivered monthly . The company , however , supplied only 49 jeeps in two years and refused to compensate the government . The payment of the jeeps by Britain was part of the British war debt to India dating back to the Second World War .
Corruption allegations
Menon bypassed protocol to sign a deal worth Rs . 80 lakh to the foreign firm for the purchase of the jeeps . Govind Ballabh Pant , the Home Minister and the Indian government announced on 30 September 1955 that the Jeep scandal case had been closed for judicial inquiry and ignored the suggestion by the Inquiry Committee , led by Ananthsayanam Ayyangar . They declared that `` as far as Government was concerned it has made up its mind to close the matter . If the opposition was not satisfied they can make it an election issue '' . Soon afterward , on 3 February 1956 , Menon was inducted into the Nehru cabinet as minister without portfolio . Later , Menon became Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru 's trusted ally as defence minister . However , there was no evidence to doubt Mr Menon 's personal integrity .
Mahatma Gandhi 's personal secretary , U V Kalyanam , in a newspaper interview , said , `` It is pertinent to mention here that Nehru made corrupt colleagues like Krishna Menon , who was involved in the infamous 'jeep scam ' while they were the Defence Minister '' .

Wilhem Heinrich Kramer ( 1724 in Dresden – 13 October 1765 ) was a German physician and naturalist .
Kramer studied in Vienna ( Austria ) then practiced medicine in Bruck , close to the capital , for at least fourteen years . They published in 1756 a work entitled Elenchus Vegetabilium and Animalium per Austriam inferiorem Observatorum , a flora and fauna of Lower Austria noted especially because it was one of the first works to adopt the binomial nomenclature of Carl von Linné ( 1707–1778 ) . In this book , Kramer created the name pratincola for the collared pratincole which was adapted in English in the following work of Thomas Pennant ( 1726–1798 ) in 1773 . It is probably for them that Giovanni Antonio Scopoli ( 1723–1788 ) dedicated Psittacus krameri ( today Psittacula krameri ) in 1769 . They are also known as an entomologist .

The First Constitutional Era ( ; ) of the Ottoman Empire was the period of constitutional monarchy from the promulgation of the Ottoman constitution of 1876 ( , , meaning 'Basic Law ' or 'Fundamental Law ' in Ottoman Turkish ) , written by members of the Young Ottomans , that began on 23 December 1876 and lasted until 14 February 1878 . These Young Ottomans were dissatisfied by the Tanzimat and instead pushed for a constitutional government similar to that in Europe . The constitutional period started with the dethroning of Sultan Abdulaziz . Abdul Hamid II took their place as Sultan . The era ended with the suspension of the Ottoman Parliament and the constitution by Sultan Abdul Hamid II , with which they restored their own absolute monarchy .
The first constitutional era did not include a party system . At the time , the Ottoman Parliament ( known as the General Assembly of the Ottoman Empire ) was seen as the voice of the people but not as a venue for the formation of political parties and organizations .
The elections for the Parliament were held in accordance with the provisional electoral regulations . The Parliament ( General Assembly of the Ottoman Empire ; , ) was composed in two stages . The lower house of the bicameral legislature was the Chamber of Deputies ( , ) , while the upper house was the Senate ( , ) . The initial selection of deputies was made by administrative councils in the provinces ( also called ) .
After the establishment of the General Assembly in the provinces , the members selected the deputies from within the assembly to form the Chamber of Deputies in the capital . The Chamber had 115 members and reflected the distribution of the millets in the empire . In the second elections , there were 69 Muslim millet representatives and 46 representatives of other millets ( Jews , Phanariotes , Armenians ) .
The second body was the Senate , and the members were selected by the Sultan . The Senate had only 26 members . It was designed to replace the porte , and the Grand Vizier become the speaker of Senate .
The two elections happened between 1877 and 1878 .
First term , 1877
The members ' reactions to the approaching war were very strong , and Sultan Abdul Hamid II asked for new elections citing the Russo-Turkish War ( 1877–1878 ) .
Second term , 1878
The life of the second term of the parliament was merely a few days , as after the initial speeches by the members from Balkan vilayets ,
Abdul Hamid II closed the parliament , citing social unrest .
The president of the Chamber of Deputies was a Deputy from Jerusalem , Yusif Dia Pasha Al Khalidi .

The Dreamtime Cultural Centre 's Darumbal Convention Centre was officially opened by Lois O'Donoghue on 7 August 1994 .
The late Nola James and Ted Mitchell , who are credited with much of the lobbying in the 1980s to have the centre established are both honoured at the Dreamtime Cultural Centre , with the main building at the complex named the Nola James Building and with a museum called the Ted Mitchell Gallery , which houses the Vanishing Culture of the Sandstone Belt display .
In 2004 , a short film , written and directed by Wayne Blair , was produced at the centre called Dramatically Black - The Djarns Djarns : Shake a leg .
The Dreamtime Cultural Centre celebrated its 20th anniversary in 2008 .
In 2012 , Australian rugby league player Johnathan Thurston visited the centre to speak to high school students and to promote the FOGS ARTIE program , which is aimed to achieve results through Indigenous education .

Ferdinand Münz ( 1888-1969 ) was an Austrian chemist who first synthetized EDTA ( ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid ) at the IG Farben in 1935 , patented both in Germany ( anonymously ) and in the USA ( with their name ) , with the aim of producing a citric acid substitute , in order to reduce the German government 's dependence on imports of chemical products from abroad . Münz noted that an aminocarboxylic acid worked much better as a chelating agent than citric acid and therefore thought that a polyaminopolycarboxylic acid would have worked even better .
In 1945 they worked closely with the future Nobel laureate Kurt Alder ( 1902-1958 ) . In 1949 they published a paper together on diene synthesis and additions .

Greenwood Cemetery is a historic cemetery located in Orlando , Florida .
History
In 1880 , eight Orlando residents pulled together to buy 26 acres of land and form Orlando Cemetery . The name was changed to Greenwood Cemetery in 1915 at the request of two of its founders . The cemetery has expanded with land purchases over time and now has 86 acres of land . Sections of the cemetery are dedicated to Confederate veterans , Union veterans , Spanish-American veterans , World War I veterans and World War II veterans .
Moonlight walking tours of the cemetery are popular in Orlando . These tours are led by a sexton and it offers a window into Orlando 's history .
The west side of the cemetery contains the 19-acre park , Greenwood Urban Wetlands , which was established in 1991 .
A section of the cemetery contains unmarked plots for the victims of lynchings by whites , according to history professor Vibert White . One such victim , July Perry , who was hung in 1920 after trying to vote in Ocoee , received a headstone in 2002 .
In the wake of the Pulse nightclub shooting of June 12 , 2016 , the City of Orlando offered plots for those killed .

Burger Quiz is a French humorous game show created by Alain Chabat and Kader Aoun , first broadcast on Canal + from August 27 , 2001 , to July 5 , 2002 , before being replayed on Comédie ! Channel from 2006 .
A new version of the show has started on April 25 , 2018 , on the French channel TMC .
On April 26th , 2018 , it has officially become the most watched entertainment show in the history of French digital TV with 2.3 million of viewers .
The first version of the show was first produced by Chez Wam , the production company of Alain Chabat , then by R & G productions . Almost always hosted by Alain Chabat the show also involved several other French personalities as host ( Kad and Olivier , Marina Foïs , Gerard Darmon ... ) .
The TV show also involved a voice over , made by French comedian Bruno Salomone since the beginning .
The concept of the TV show is based on a series of more or less serious questions . Two teams , the ketchup and the mustard , fight to reach 25 points first . Both teams are composed of two celebrities and one anonymous candidate . The winning team can access to the final test `` Le burger de la mort '' ( the death burger ) which consists of ten questions asked one after the other to the candidate which then need to answer them in the right order .
Background
Created in 2001 by Alain Chabat and Kader Aoun , the TV show had for mission to replace one of the biggest success of Canal + at that time , another French TV show called “ Nulle part ailleurs ” . Popular during its first season that aired between August 27 an July 5 , 2001 , the show was a reference in what was called in France “ l'esprit Canal ” , in reference to the new concepts and the new form of humour that the French Channel Canal + created . Even though the show was a success , the original show only got one season .
From 2006 , another French TV channel , Comédie + , decided to broadcast on replay every episode from that first season , contributing to the success of the show .
In 2018 , Alain Chabat has decided to do a reboot of the show . After several refusals , notably by Canal+ , the first episode of the second season was broadcast on April 25 , on the French channel TMC which belongs to the TF1 group .
The two versions of the show have the same director , Jérôme Revon , who also owns R & G production , the new production company for the TV show .
The show has now 4 seasons and is still on air .
Concept
The concept of the TV show is based on a quiz with questions on broad topics .
The show 's universe takes place in a burger restaurant ( hence the name ) which is managed by the presenter .
Two teams fight each other , the ketchup and the mayonnaise , and are composed of two celebrities and one anonymous candidate . The goal is to first reach 25 points ( called “ miam ” ) which allow the candidate of the winning team to try the “ death burger ” ( le burger de la mort ) . The goal is to win €1000 .
The 25 points can be won through four different rounds :
Nuggets ( Nuggets )
Salt or Pepper ( Sel ou poivre )
The Menu ( Menus )
The Bill ( L'addition )
The final round is `` The Death Burger '' ( Le burger de la mort ) which consists of ten questions asked by the host one after the other to the candidate which then need to answer them in the right order without forgetting one .
In the 2018 's version , the show is interspersed with humorous sketches featuring French actors .
Writers
With the departure of one of its creators , Kader Aoun , the new version of Burger Quiz has new writers .
The new team consists of Benoît Oullion , 34 , Dan Andreï , 24 , Ambre Larrazet , 31 , Cyril Cohen , 43 , and Max Chabat , 25 , Alain Chabat 's son
The voice-over has from the beginning been provided by French comedian Bruno Salomone .
Merchandising
Burger Quiz has launched in October 2018 its own board game at Dujardin edition .

Nikolai Timofeevich Beliaev or Nicholas Timothy Belaiew ( 26 June 1878 – 5 November 1955 ) was a Russian metallurgist . They were famous for their studies on Damascus steel and the idea of crystallization in metals and the production of Widmanstatten structures . They also wrote on the history of steel making .
Beliaev was born in St. Petersburg to General T. M. Beliaev and Maria Nikolayevna Septjurina . They were educated at Mikhailovskaya Artilleriiskaya Academy and was trained under Dmitry Konstantinovich Chernov and Henry Le Chatelier . They became a professor of metallurgy in 1909 . During World War I they were wounded and they were sent to England in 1915 . They received a Bessemer Gold Medal in 1937 from the British Institute of Steel and Iron in London . A major contribution was on the studies of crystal structure in steels both human-made and of meteoric origin and examined their mechanical properties . They also took an interest in Icelandic research .

The Four Elements is a series of four oil paintings by the Italian artist Giuseppe Arcimboldo which were created in 1566 , during the Renaissance , for Maximilian II , Holy Roman Emperor . The paintings depict human faces in profile made up from different animals or objects . Air is represented by birds , Fire by burning wood and cannons , Earth by land animals and Water by marine creatures . The series attempts to express the creation of harmony from chaos by the careful arrangement of the wild animals to form portraits whilst also praising Maximilian by suggesting that they are a ruler who controls even the four primal elements .
Historical background
After training in Milan , Arcimboldo became the court painter for the Habsburgs , to Ferdinand I at the court in Vienna and later , to Maximilian II and their son Rudolf II at the court in Prague . Giuseppe gained knowledge of exotic and local animals because at the time Prague was a cultural center and exotic creatures such as the lion and elephant were brought there from all over the world .
Description
Air displays a cornucopia of small birds that combine to create a slender male face . The majority of the birds are only partially visible which allow the artist to create the face and hair . The body is formed by a peacock ; the goatee is a tail of a pheasant , and a duck forms the eyelids . The eagle and peacock are references to the Habsburg dynasty . Giuseppe included this reference to please their patrons and form a permanent bond between the painting and the Habsburgs .
Unlike the others , Fire is formed from inanimate objects . Flint and steel form the nose and ear . Burning wood creates a crown of glowing hair . Arcimboldo uses guns to create the main part of the body . Fire has the most references to the Habsburg dynasty . The Order of the Golden Fleece hangs in front of the body , which is a reference to the most important knightly order of the time . The double headed eagle , a symbol of the Holy Roman Empire , sits proudly on the torso . The two large cannons refer to the strength of the Habsburg armies in their ongoing war with the Turks .
Earth is perhaps the most skilfully blended piece the land animals curving together to create a strong , thick face . Antlered creatures surround the head , forming a crown . An elephant creates the cheek and ear while a wolf eating a mouse forms the eyelid and pupil . A full cow represents the neck . Like its siblings , the lion and the fleece are references to the Habsburg dynasty .
Water features the most realistic depictions . A chaotic mess of sea creatures create a woman 's face . Them breastplate is a crab , turtle and lobster along with an octopus on their shoulder . The animals that make up their head are obscure but a clear crown is formed by the spines on the back of a fish and long pieces of coral . Almost seeming out of place , a pearl necklace lies across their neck framing their face and completing the pattern of order from confusion . They also wear a pearl earring .
This series is analogous to another of Arcimboldo 's sets called The Four Seasons . Both series have the same number of pieces , and logically correspond to each other ; Air to Spring , Fire to Summer , Earth to Autumn and Water to Winter . This pairing creates linked themes of chaos brought into harmony and the glorification of the Habsburg dynasty .

Parker Otto Ackley ( May 25 , 1903 , Granville , New York – August 23 , 1989 ) was an American gunsmith , barrel maker , author , columnist , and wildcat cartridge developer . The Ackley Improved family of wildcat cartridges are designed to be easily made by rechambering existing firearms , and fireforming the ammunition to decrease body taper and increase shoulder angle , resulting in a higher case capacity . Ackley improved not only standard cartridges , but also other popular wildcats , and was the first to create a .17 caliber ( 4.5 mm ) centerfire cartridge .
Biography
Ackley began gunsmithing full-time in Oregon in 1936 , but was interrupted by World War II . In 1945 , they established a new shop in Trinidad , Colorado , and soon became one of the largest custom gunmakers in the United States . They were also on the staff of the magazines Guns & Ammo and Shooting Times , and was an instructor at the Trinidad State Junior College from 1946 to 1951 , where they did much experimentation in the field of firearms . For a complete biography read the book , `` P.O . Ackley , America 's Gunsmith '' .
Wildcats and Ackley Improved Cartridges
The following is a list of Ackley cartridges , both `` Improved '' versions ( requiring only fireforming ) and more complex versions involving case length reductions or caliber changes . In addition to being easy to form , firearms chambered for the `` Improved '' cartridges could fire standard factory loaded ammunition as well , allowing a shooter to use commonly available ammunition if the wildcat loads were n't available .

.475 Ackley Magnum , based on a .375 H & H Magnum necked up to .475 ( 12 mm )
Other research
Ackley was not just a wildcatter , they were a researcher as well , often testing firearms to destruction in the search for information . They also produced a number of experimental cartridges , not intended to be practical , but rather to test the limits of firearms . One of these experimental cartridges was the .22 Eargesplitten Loudenboomer . This humorously named cartridge was developed by Ackley for Bob Hutton of Guns & Ammo magazine , and was intended solely to exceed muzzle velocity . Ackley 's loads only managed ( Mach 4.2 ) , firing a bullet . Based on a .378 Weatherby Magnum case , the case is impractically over-capacity for the bore diameter , and so the cartridge remains a curiosity . The advent of new slower-burning smokeless powders may have changed the equation .
Another humorous round , the .17 Flintstone Super Eyebunger , based on the .22-250 necked down to .17 caliber , has been used by Australian gunsmith Bill Hambly-Clark , Jr. to achieve velocities of out of a barreled gun .

Buccanodon is a bird genus in the African barbet family ( Lybiidae ) which was formerly included in the Capitonidae and sometimes in the Ramphastidae . It contains two species , both referred to as the yellow-spotted barbets .
This genus was formerly considered a monotypic taxon just containing B. duchaillui , but a study published in 2019 found populations west of the Dahomey Gap to constitute a new , distinct species , B. dowsetti . Both species are nearly identical and can only be reliably distinguished in the field by their songs and their distribution .

The comparison usually discusses the modelling tradeoffs faced when using the input languages of each model checker , as well as the comparison of performances of the tools when verifying correctness properties . One can mention :
In 1999 , Judi Romijn compared two model checkers ( CADP and SPIN ) on the HAVi interoperability audio-video protocol for consumer electronics .
In 2003 , Yifei Dong , Xiaoqun Du , Gerard J. Holzmann , and Scott A. Smolka published a comparison of four model checkers ( namely : Cospan , Murphi , SPIN , and XMC ) on a communication protocol , the GNU i-protocol .
In 2005 , Elena M. Bortnik , Nikola Trcka , Anton Wijs , Bas Luttik , J. M. van de Mortel-Fronczak , Jos C. M. Baeten , Wan Fokkink , and J. E. Rooda published a comparison of four model checkers ( namely : CADP , muCRL , SPIN , and UPPAAL ) on an industrial manufacturing system , a rotating drilling machine .
In 2018 , F. Mazzanti and A. Ferrari published a comparison of ten model checkers ( namely : CADP , CPN Tools , FDR4 , NuSMV/nuXmv , mCRL2 , ProB , SPIN , TLA+ , UMC , and UPPAAL ) on a train supervision problem , taking into account both the user-friendliness of the languages and the performance of the tools .
International software competitions
Since 2007 , the Hardware Model Checking Competition ( HWMCC ) compares the performances of model checking tools oriented towards hardware design .
Since 2011 , the Model Checking Contest ( MCC ) compare performances of model checking tools designed to analyze highly concurrent systems .
Common benchmarks
MCC ( models of the Model Checking Contest ) : a collection of hundreds of Petri nets originating from many academic and industrial case studies .
VLTS ( Very Large Transition Systems ) : a collection of Labelled Transition Systems of increasing sizes , used in many scientific publications .

Beatrice of Portugal ( ; 1382November 1439 ) , LG , was a natural daughter of John I of Portugal and Inês Pires born before the marriage of their father with Philippa of Lancaster . They were a sister of Afonso , Duke of Braganza and half-sister of King Edward of Portugal , Infante Peter , Duke of Coimbra , Henry the Navigator , Isabella of Portugal , Duchess of Burgundy , John , Constable of Portugal , and Ferdinand the Saint Prince . Queen Philippa was in charge of the education of both of their husband 's children out of wedlock .
Beatrice was born 1382 , possibly in Veiros , Alentejo , Portugal . Some say that their mother Inês Pires was `` the daughter of a Jewish cobbler . '' But others say they came from an old Portuguese noble line . In April 1405 their wedding with Thomas Fitzalan , 12th Earl of Arundel by proxy was celebrated in Lisbon and , in the same year , they travelled to England , accompanied by their brother Afonso and many of the king 's vassals and their ladies-in-waiting where the marriage ceremony took place on 26 November 1405 in London , with King Henry IV in attendance .
Thomas died on 13 October 1415 . Beatrice then married John Holland , Earl of Huntingdon , nephew of their stepmother Queen Philippa , in 1432 . They are sometimes confused with another Portuguese lady , Beatrice Pinto , wife of Gilbert Talbot and Thomas Fittiplace . It is unknown if Beatrice had children from any of their marriages . Beatrice died in Bordeaux , France in November 1439 . After their death their husband married Lady Anne Montagu .

Corran Descy Addison ( born February 6 , 1969 , in South Africa ) and is a slalom canoeist , whitewater kayaker , surfer and surfboard designer . They are now based in San Clemente , California .
Beginnings
Addison began kayaking in South Africa in the mid 1970s . Introduced by their father to the sport , they would construct the fiberglass kayaks they needed to paddle the rivers in the basement of Rhodes University where their father Graeme Addison was a professor of journalism . Throughout the 1970s and intom the early 1980s , their kayaking consisted of long multi day expeditions in the unknown , and it was here on these long expeditions that Addison forged their love for paddling adventure . The beginnings were simple however , as they and their friends did not know about basic skills such as the Eskimo Roll until they and their friends saw a paddler roll in a TV show called American Sportsman . They were astonished , replayed the segment of the tape , and with the aid of the 1981 world silver medalist kayaker Jerome Truran , taught themselves to roll .
In 1982 , a small shipment of `` plastic '' kayaks entered the country ( which was under international sanctions because of the Apartheid regime ) and Graeme purchased two of the kayaks , the Perception Dancer for Corran and himself . Effectively indestructible , short and maneuverable , these boats completely changed the face of paddling for the young paddler whose skillsets increased at such a rapid rate that by 1987 they would run the highest waterfall in the world ; the 31m in Tignes , France .
Competitions
Addison competed internationally in whitewater slalom in the early 1990s . They finished 34th in the K-1 event at the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona . In 1987 , Addison successfully ran the highest waterfall ever attempted in a kayak : a 31m vertical drop into Lake Tignes in France . The unofficial record stood for over a decade until it was broken in 2004 by Ed Lucero 's 34m waterfall in the Northwest Territories of Canada . In 1989 , they famously ran 85-foot Looking Glass Falls in a Batman costume . The river was running low , so the landing was shallow , and Addison broke theirs back .
Addison competed for South Africa in a number of world freestyle kayaking championships , winning more events than any other competitor in the years 1993 to 1999 , and earned a silver medal in 1995 and 1999 , and bronze in 1998 . They also produced a number of kayaking films between 2002 and 2007 .
Design career
Addison has had a long career in kayak design .
Early career
As well as a competitor , they became known in the whitewater kayaking community as a designer by pioneering a number of innovative designs ( including their first planing-hulled kayak in 1988 , later independently reinvented by Canada 's Necky Kayaks . Addison continued to work on the concept and brought it to the mass market in the early 1990s that is the technology upon which most modern whitewater kayaks are based ) . Working for Perception Kayaks , Addison was responsible in part for the design of one of the world 's best selling creek boats , the Corsica , in 1990 . They left Perception and started Savage Designs in 1994 , leaving in 1996 . In 1995 , they designed the Fury , one of the world 's first planing-hulled river kayaks . Their marketing at Savage Designs laid the groundwork for the Generation X marketing that was to be followed by their next start-up company , Riot Kayaks , where they worked as chief designer and head of marketing .
Riot Kayaks
The Riot brand was notorious for cutting edge designs and a go-for-broke attitude to freestyle kayaking and extreme white water . One boat which they designed was the Glide , the kayak that is reputed to have been responsible for a last-minute rule change at the 1997 world championships because it was so far ahead in technology that they were considered to have an unfair advantage by the other athletes . They also designed the Disco in 1999 , the design which all modern freestyle kayaks are measured against today .
Addison was in their day considered somewhat controversial in the world of whitewater kayaking by their brash and cocksure attitude . However , the young kayakers of today mirror the young Addison in many ways and so it would seem they helped pave the way to a new generation of kayaking which subsists in today 's pro paddlers .
Imagine Media
In 2002 Addison took their tinkering in the field of making sports action videos from an amateurish pastime to a professional level when they started Imagine Media . They produced the award-winning film , End Game , and numerous other films including `` Legend of the Falls '' , `` Air force 1 '' , and `` Mad Boys '' . They also worked on several Hollywood film projects as a stuntman or providing safety .
Imagine Surfboards
After leaving Riot in 2003 , they began designing for Dragorossi , a new Kayak brand out of Italy . They were becoming more interested in surfing which had become their new passion , despite surfing their whole life starting in Durban South Africa where they lived through the 1980s . Addison owned and designed for their surf company called Imagine Eco , based out of Montreal . The name was changed to Imagine Eco , and was considered a cutting-edge company in the field of sustainable and ecological business , and has been leading the way in promoting responsible manufacturing in the surf industry .. They sold it to the investment firm `` The Contrarian Group '' in California in 2010 for $ 2 million . Imagine Surf ( the name was changed again when it was subsequently sold to the Pryde Group , based out of Hong Kong ) . Corran is also a competitive Stand Up Paddle Surfer and competed in the 2010 Hawaiian World Cup , has won numerous distance and racing SUP competitions all of the world , and is a big wave surfer , having surfed such well knows spots as Wiamea , Makaha and Sunset .
Corran SUP
IN 2012 Corran started their lnext venture , Corran SUP , based out of Southern California . The brand pioneered paddleboards for use in whitewater , and focused on `` made in the USA '' , producing almost everything in the United States . Corran built a reputation as a leading shaper of both surfing and racing paddleboard designs , with several of their designs getting rave reviews in the industry magazines . In January 2015 the brand was sold to Kayak Distribution .
They pioneered surfing the Habitat 67 wave in Montreal . Their company Imagine Surfboards offers river surfing lessons , teaching over 3,500 students in Montreal since 2005 . Imagine also manufactures and sells surfboards , suits and accessories .
Soul Waterman
In 2015 Corran started their latest company , SOUL WATERMAN . Based in Montreal Canada , where they started Riot in the 1990s , and the brand is designing a new line of highly innovative whitewater specific paddleboards and kayaks . Corran has arrived with their latest industry changing innovation , custom kayaks . They have developed a secret method of manufacturing one piece , one-off designed from the ground up for each paddlers needs . This is something which is completely unique to kayaking , and should prove to be a game changer .
Other Sports
Corran retired from competitive kayaking in 2002 , and since then has gone on to compete in Paddleboarding and SUP Surfing . They have competed at a world class level , taking part in the surfing world Cup , and has competed and won SUP racing events internationally . Corran was one of the first people in the United States to be certified by the National Ski Patrol on a Snowboard . They were a sponsored snowboarder for many years , racing in the Mid Atlantic series for several years . Corran is also a licensed sportbike motorcycle racer , competing on sportbikes .

Jibran Masud ( Arabic : جبران مسعود ; born 1930 ) is a Lebanese writer , scholar and researcher . They first started writing at the age of 17 , and managed to publish around 30 books by the age of 80 . They wrote in different genres including stories and novels , and conducted linguistic and literary researches , and was nominated for a number of national and Arab literary awards for helping enrich the Arabic language .
Personal life
Before they landed themselves their current pseudonym , Masud was given `` Ghibrial Masud '' as their birth name . They were in their fourth year at the International College when they learned about their pseudonym . Masud registered to give out a speech about Lebanon when they noticed a change in their name among the list of reciters . They discovered that their professor , and the renowned poet , Fuad Suleiman , changed Masud 's name to “ Jibran Masud ” so that it stands out as the Arabized version of `` Ghibrial Masud . '' Since that day , Masud continues to be called by this pen-name .
Masud met their wife , Josephine Masud , who was also a writer , during their university years . They gave birth to four children ; two of which are daughters and the other two sons , and most of whom live abroad , and lived for 35 years together before their passing away . Masud also has nine grandchildren .
Education
In 1950 , Masud graduated from American University of Beirut with a Bachelor of Science degree in Arabic Language and Literature and History with honors , and a Master 's degree in Arabic literature , three years later .
They were mentored by prominent Lebanese poets , including Mishal Bashir and Fouad Suleiman , whom Masud looked up to as the second most influential literary role model , following their father .
Masud achieved a high proficiency in the English and French languages .
Career
Masud is considered to be one of the building blocks of Arabic literature of their time . In 1947 , and in response to the Arab issues occurring at the international level , 17-year-old Masud composed their first poem titled `` Palestine '' . A year later , they published `` Red Ashes , '' which is a book that sparked controversy among religious communities for rebelling against obsolete traditions , such as interfaith marriages that allows Muslim women to be married to men who are People of the Book , namely Christians . As a result , one of the religious schools in Lebanon prohibited its students from reading the book . Despite that , the book gained a wide recognition and was even featured by Maroon Abood on Radio Lebanon .
Before it was published in 1992 , Masud dedicated 15 years of their life composing `` Al-Ra'id , '' an extensive , linguistic lexicon . However , it was in 2016 when they broke new ground in the field of lexicography , which is by publishing `` The Encyclopedia of Arabic Literature : its Eras , Arts and Most Renowned Figures , ” and issued it in eight volumes . For 7 years , Masud compiled all the artistic characteristics of Arabic literature and its most renowned figures over the centuries ; that is , starting from pre-Islamic period , the early years of Islam , up until the Umayyad era , the Abbasid era , and the Andalusian era . The encyclopedia also covers different poetry movements including Sufi and Chivalric poetry . In addition , Masud specialized a section of the encyclopedia for literary criticism , which adopted the methodology of discussing , analyzing and explaining literary texts from a literary , linguistic and graphical perspective , in attempt to draw out the beauty of the texts .
Masud founded the House of Wisdom publishing house ( romanized : Bayt Al-Hikmah ) , which was known for publishing for a number of leading literary writers . Moreover , they have published a number of articles and researches , namely in the fields of literature , linguistics and history , in Lebanese newspapers .
Masud experienced a writer 's block twice in their life . The first cause was the Lebanese Civil War which deprived them of the freedom to express themselves genuinely , and , the second was the passing away of their wife . Once they broke free from the block , they vowed not to hold any political or diplomatic positions to devote their effort to writing only .

Henry Louis Bellmon ( September 3 , 1921 – September 29 , 2009 ) was an American Republican politician from the U.S. State of Oklahoma . A member of the Oklahoma Legislature , they went on to become both the 18th and 23rd governor of Oklahoma , mainly in the 1960s and again in the 1980s , as well as a two-term United States Senator in the 1970s . They were the first Republican to serve as Governor of Oklahoma and , after their direct predecessor George Nigh , only the second governor to be reelected .
A World War II veteran , Bellmon served a single term in the Oklahoma House of Representatives , before running for governor . After serving in the U.S. Senate , they returned to serve again as governor and was responsible for passing a large education reform package . They died in 2009 after a long struggle with Parkinson 's disease .
Early life and career
Bellmon was born in Tonkawa , Oklahoma , and graduated from Billings High School in Billings , Oklahoma . They graduated from Oklahoma A & M ( now Oklahoma State University ) in 1942 with a bachelor 's degree in agriculture . They were a lieutenant in the United States Marine Corps from 1942 to 1946 . They were a tank platoon leader in the Pacific Theater of World War II . They took part in four amphibious landings on Pacific islands , including Iwo Jima . For their service , they were awarded the Legion of Merit and a Silver Star . After the war they returned to farming and took up politics .
Bellmon served a single term in the Oklahoma House of Representatives from 1946 to 1948 . In January 1947 , they married Shirley Osborn , to whom they remained married until their death in 2000 . In 1960 they served as the State Republican Party Chairman .
Governor of Oklahoma
In 1962 , beating the studied journalist and well known constructor Bill Atkinson with 392,316 votes ( 55.3 % ) , Bellmon became Oklahoma 's first Republican governor since statehood in 1907 . While governor , they served as the chairperson of the Interstate Oil Compact Commission and as a member of the executive committee of the National Governor 's Association . They were unable to run for reelection in 1966 ; at the time , Oklahoma did not allow governors to immediately succeed themselves . Republican Dewey F. Bartlett was elected as their successor .
United States Senate
In 1968 , they were serving as the national chairperson for Richard Nixon 's presidential election campaign , but then decided to run for the U.S. Senate , and won , unseating U.S . Senator A.S. Mike Monroney .
Their 1974 contest was far closer and ultimately was resolved by the Senate . On election night , They led Rep. Ed Edmondson by only 3,835 votes . Edmondson challenged the result alleging irregularities in the voting , specifically that Tulsa County did not have levers to allow straight-ticket voting , as required under state law , and that the machines had misleading instructions . The Oklahoma Supreme Court ruled that there were problems , but Edmondson could not demonstrate that they would have changed the result . Edmondson then appealed to the Senate in January 1975 , asking it to take up the challenge . Although the Senate voted to seat Bellmon , this was done without prejudice to the challenge .
The Senate investigated the election and the Rules and Administration Committee voted along party lines on a report that it could not identify who won the election . The full Senate would have to decide how to proceed . Both candidates made their cases on the floor and nine Democrats voted along with all the Republicans to end the challenge and seat Bellmon . Although the Democratic Party had a 62–38 majority , seven Democrats were not in Washington and did not vote .
They did not run for a third term in 1980 . During their service in the Senate , they sometimes took moderate positions that put them at odds with the largely conservative Oklahoma Republican Party : they supported Gerald Ford over Ronald Reagan in the 1976 presidential election ( even though the state delegation was committed to Reagan ) ; they opposed a constitutional amendment to prohibit forced busing for the purpose of racially desegregating public schools ; and they supported the Panama Canal treaty .
In 1976 , Bellmon was inducted into the Oklahoma Hall of Fame .
During their second term they were the ranking Republican on the Senate Budget Committee . They were a co-founder and co-chairperson of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget . They chose not to run for re-election in 1980 and was succeeded by Republican Don Nickles .
Bellmon was appointed the interim director of the Oklahoma Department of Human Services by Governor George Nigh , a Democrat , in 1982 .
Return to governorship
As the tenures of Bellmon and their party colleague Bartlett had been followed by four terms of Democratic rule , Oklahoma Republican leaders asked them in 1986 , if they would consider running for governor again . Bellmon agreed to run , and they narrowly won the election in November with 431,762 votes ( 47.5 % ) over David Walters ( 405,295 ; 44.5 % ) . They served from January 12 , 1987 , to January 14 , 1991 . During their second tenure as governor they chaired the Southern States Energy Board .
During their second term , Bellmon worked with Democrats in the Oklahoma legislature to pass an educational reform package , House Bill 1017 , over the opposition of most Republicans . Though the state constitution had been amended in 1966 to allow governors to succeed themselves , Bellmon chose not to seek reelection in 1990 . They would have been eligible for a third term , since 8-year lifetime term limits were not enacted until 2010 . The Republican candidate to replace him , Bill Price , promised to repeal HB 1017 . However , Price was defeated by David Walters , whom Bellmon had defeated four years earlier .
Death penalty
Bellmon is notable for overseeing as governor both Oklahoma 's last pre-Furman execution ( when James French was electrocuted in 1966 ) and its first post-Furman , when Charles Coleman was put to death by lethal injection in 1990 .
Later years

Rafał Augustyn ( born August 28 , 1951 in Wrocław , Poland ) is a composer of classical music , and a pianist , music critic , writer and scholar of Polish philology . As a composer they have written symphonies , chamber orchestra works , vocal and electronic music , as well as music for theatre . Since the mid-1990s , Augustyn has collaborated with visual artists , architects and photographers on numerous multimedia art works .
Education and career
Augustyn studied composition under Ryszard Bukowski at the State Higher School of Music in Wrocław between 1971–74 , and between 1975–77 at the State Higher School of Music in Katowice , where they studied under Henryk Górecki . In 1979 , Augustyn began to teach at the Institute of Polish Philology at Wrocław University and has remained there since . Their works have had numerous performances at the Warsaw Autumn Festival , as well as at other Polish festivals , and across Europe , North America and the Far East . As a music writer and critic they have written for such journals and periodicals as Ruch Muzyczny and Odra .
As a music critic , they have also published reviews in music and literary press as well as appearing on the Polish Radio and Television . In 1984-94 , together with Marek Pijarowski , they were director of the `` Musica Polonica Nova '' Festival of Polish Contemporary Music in Wrocław . In 1980-98 they were a member of the Repertoire Committee of the `` Warsaw Autumn '' International Festival of Contemporary Music . They were co-founder of the `` Brevis '' Music Publishers .
Style
Along with Andrzej Krzanowski and Eugeniusz Knapik , Augustyn is sometimes included as a member of the so-called `` Silesian School '' ; that is , a group of composers who studied under Górecki in Katowice , Silesia , and are noted for their break with the current dominant postmodernist approach to classical music in Poland .
One of their major pieces , their `` Symphony of Hymns '' , took 20 years to complete , typically lasts for 100 minutes and requires an orchestra of over 170 players . It was described in 2004 by the music critic Tim Rutherford-Johnson as ,
`` a monster of a work .... [ but ] has that broad sweeping feel of neo-Romanticism that one might expect from a contemporary Polish symphonist , although it features none of Górecki 's direct simplicity , or Penderecki 's gloomy ponderousness . It does however ... continually blur the line between orchestration and form . Melody and harmony are present , but not discernible as such ; more important is a lilting shifting of colours that tumbles the music forward . ''

The Murray Downs Homestead is a heritage-listed homestead at Moulamein Road , Murray Downs , Murray River Council , New South Wales , Australia . It was built by Seutorius Henry Officer and Charles Officer ( between 1866 and 1884 ) ; and by Alfred Felton and Charles Campbell ( between 1884 and 1891 ) . The property is privately owned . It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 17 November 2000 .
History
The Murray Downs Station was a vast expanse of land in the south west of NSW bordered by the Wakool River to the north and the Murray River to the south . In 1848 Messrs Bell and Wilson applied to lease Crown Land of which became known as Murray Downs . In 1862 the property was divided into two leases . Murray Downs Station was then and Melool was . Murray Downs and part of the adjoining property of Melool was acquired by Seutorius Henry Officer and their brother Charles in 1862 . At that stage it was all unimproved country without fences . White colonists considered Aboriginal people a threat to themselves and to livestock . All goods arrived by paddle steamer and produce was likewise shipped along the river to Echuca and then by train to Melbourne . The Murray Downs Station prospered in the hands of Seutonius Officer . They were a pioneer of irrigation , established a flourishing citrus grove . The property became a community in itself and had to be self supporting . There was a baker , blacksmith , carpenter , steam engine drivers , drovers , shearers , wool classers etc . On 22 June 1866 the Officer brothers were authorised to purchase land on Murray Downs and by 26 January 1883 , Murray Downs consisted of of purchased land .
The property was sold at auction in 1884 to Alfred Felton and Charles Campbell . The sheep and wool industry flourished during their ownership of the station . In 1889 there were 79,326 sheep shorn on the property , which at that time consisted of . In 1905 the property came under the control of trustee Executors and Agency Company Ltd of Melbourne . In 1917 a merino stud was established under the supervision of Arthur Laird who was to manage the station until 1935 . The experiment was successful and Murray Downs was registered as a stud in 1922 . In 1969 it was purchased by Kidman Reid & Co . The property has continued to function as a successful sheep station until recent years . The first homestead on Murray Downs was a pine log and mud iron roofed hut lined with hessian and paper . The date of construction was unknown . It was demolished as recently as 1917 . The present homestead was commenced in 1866 by the Officers , who built the middle portion . Bricks were brought from Echuca by barge . A comprehensive complex of outbuildings , including sheds and stables for carriage and stable horses , wagons and buggies , a blacksmith 's shop and harness room were erected . At this time the garden was also established .
From 1888 to 1891 Messrs Campbell and Felton altered and added to the homestead . The two-storey portion and roof tower was built as a lookout for approaching aborigines as well as the beautifully proportioned dining room . The present brick kitchen was built in 1884 .
The house is currently owned on a separate title of by Matthew and Clare Lewis of Wariat Nominees . The homestead is open to public inspection and used as a venue for functions . The property is still farmed as a hobby farm that provides a backdrop to the historic building complex .
Description
The precinct includes the main house that has a painted rendered finish to brick work , with some face brick , corrugated iron roofs , verandahs all round , two-storey towers , a viewing platform , bay windows , complex roof forms , classical detailing , flush eaves overhangs , and an enclosed an internal courtyard . The courtyard has a fine gravel finish and the edges are defined by the homestead , blacksmiths workshops , and old school house . A timber picket fence surrounds the precinct with posts topped by decorative finials . A formal garden with decorative planting and geometric garden beds with brick edging ; and a small house orchard ; a grand driveway is lined by trees of historic significance ; and an artificial lake .
Condition
As at 24 November 2000 , the homestead and grounds were in good condition . Repairs and maintenance of the precinct has been constant as required for public display .
The property of the Murray Downs estate has been gradually eroded and disassembled over the years . The original estate has been subdivided repeatedly . Records from the Lands and Titles Office reveal Certificates of Title for the subject property as far back as 1867 . Suetonius Henry Officer was granted for the sum of One hundred and ninety six pounds , Lot 29 Vol . 1605 Fol . 14of area . The land title according to evidence available remained at this size and configuration until 1969 when a small portion on the north west corner on the main road was subdivided off . The remaining parcel , titled Lot 2 in Deposited Plan 531599 in the shire of Wakool Parish of Yellymong and County of Wakool was in area .
In 1982 another portion at the western end of the lot , in area was subdivided from the original lot . The remaining Lot had become a Torrens Title , now defined as Lot 4 in DP 623456 had an area of . The next recorded change to the Lot was in 1989 when the eastern boundary was adjusted to increase the property to . The eastern boundary ran along the road known as Murray Downs Drive and included a parcel along the river further east from the existing and previous boundary . The Lot was then known as Lot 7 in DP 785831 . In 1996 the property is shown in its current configuration as Lot 15 DP 859813 with an area of .
The south eastern portion of the site is subdivided into a variety lot including 12 houses sized lots along the river frontage and 2 larger lots . namely Lot 1 and Lot 14 of and respectively . Subsequently in 1999 council has approved further subdivision of Lot 1 for housing development . The pattern of evolution of the subject lot since 1969 has been gradual reduction in size with subdivision of land into smaller lot sizes . This land use pattern reflects the changing nature of the agricultural industry , which is no longer buoyant and prosperous . It also reflects the increasing popularity of the hobby farm or small boutique farm lot and the demand for single lot housing in out of town locations especially bounding the riverbanks . The homestead itself shows a remarkable likeness to a sketch drawn in 1868 . It appears to have had no major additions since the early 1900s . The immediate homestead precinct remains reasonably intact .
Modifications and dates
The homestead and surrounds evolved and changed over the period 1866-1891 . The building complex probably was at its peak around 1890 . At this time there were 6 houses on the entire estate and many more outbuildings . While the homestead complex reduced in size since , there have been no new additions to the house itself . Any significant changes in the precinct are to the gardens and surrounds . The intrusion is of little or no significance .

As at 12 February 2001 , the Homestead and its surrounding precinct had historical significance as a record of rural life and industry and their evolution over the last 160 years . The aesthetic significance of the precinct is limited . While the main buildings and surrounds are fine examples of their times , they are not exceptional or innovative or rare . The Murray Downs homestead and surrounds are highly valued by the local Community . The Wakool Council has listed the item in its LEP and DCP as an `` historic precinct '' . The homestead is open to the public for inspection and it is apparent that it is highly valued by the local community and travelers to the region .
The precinct is representative of aristocratic pastoral practices of the 19th century and as such is a fine example of its type . In the region it represents an endangered aspect of our cultural environment .
Murray Downs Homestead was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 17 November 2000 having satisfied the following criteria .
The place is important in demonstrating the course , or pattern , of cultural or natural history in New South Wales .
The subject building and surrounds show evidence of historic significance in that they display a record of a particular era in the Murray Valley region and the rise and decline of the agricultural industry . The story of agriculture in Australia in general and on the Murray Downs estate in particular is evidenced here in the buildings and remnants of the wider property . The homestead precinct is a record of the lifestyle of the farming families and their approach to agriculture during the century and the first half of this century .
The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales .
The homestead building itself is a major work by an unknown designer . It represents no technical or creative innovation . It is a charming building of good proportions and elegant design . It is not however aesthetically distinctive .
The homestead and its surrounds are a landmark in the local area , providing a physically significant tower and building in an otherwise flat plain dotted with humble homes . The grand driveway and garden surrounds also provide a point of significance , a highlight in the surrounding utilitarian landscape . The taste and style are not unique across the state but in the context of the region today are significant .
The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social , cultural or spiritual reasons .
The property is listed with the local Council , Shire of Wakool in the Wakool LEP and DCP as a heritage item . The current boundary to the Murray Downs Property defines an `` historic precinct '' in the Wakool DCP . The homestead is a tourist attraction and the local community takes pride in its existence . It is valued by the neighbouring properties as providing a desirable backdrop to their outlooks . This value is based `` on amenity reasons '' . Heritage Office and Department of Urban Affairs and Planning , P 4-5 . The buildings and immediate precinct are not crucial to the community 's sense of place .
The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales .
The buildings do provide evidence of past lifestyles however these are available elsewhere . They have little research and/or educational potential
The place possesses uncommon , rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales .
The house in itself is not a rare building . Many such examples of residential buildings built in the late 1800s exist throughout Australia . However in the context of the region the entire precinct is rare . There are few remaining examples of the grand rural estate in the Murray Valley region . As such the old homestead tells a story the people in the present . The grand homestead and surrounding court and utilitarian buildings are generally under threat as the farming industry declines or is industrialized .
The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales .
The homestead , blacksmiths workshop and school house all represent their class of items i.e . rural outbuildings of a residential and working nature . They are unaltered and typical of such outbuildings . They have the principal characteristics such as materials and construction methods .
The buildings are outstanding as part of their immediate setting and their place in the local region rather than due to their individual merit .

Nikolai Nikolaevich Nekhoroshev ( ; 2 October 1946 – 18 October 2008 ) was a prominent Soviet Russian mathematician specializing in classical mechanics and dynamical systems . Their research concerned Hamiltonian mechanics , perturbation theory , celestial mechanics , integrable systems , dynamical systems , the quasiclassical approximation , and singularity theory . They proved , in particular , a stability result in KAM-theory stating that , under certain conditions , solutions of nearly integrable systems stay close to invariant tori for exponentially long times .
Nekhoroshev was professor of the Moscow State University and University of Milan . They were an alumnus of Moscow 's boarding school no . 18 ( 1964 ) .

Levopimaric acid is an abietane-type of diterpene resin acid . It is a major constituent of pine oleoresin with the chemical formula of C20H30O2 . In general , the abietene types of diterpene resin acid have various biological activities , such as antibacterial , cardiovascular and antioxidant . Levopimaric acid accounts for about 18 to 25 % of pine oleoresin . The production of oleoresin by conifer species is an important component of the defense response against insect attack and fungal pathogen infection .
Resin acids
Resin acid is the general name for all kinds of acids that share the same basic skeleton , a three-fused ring and the empirical formula C20H30O2 . The resin acids may be classified into two types , abietic and pimaric . The abietic-type group include levopimaric , l-abietic and neoabietic . The structure of these compounds differ only in the position of the conjugated double bond system . This feature influences their chemical reactivity . The pimaric-type acids are dextropimaric and isodextropimaric .
Extraction from pine resin
Levopimaric acid can be extracted from longleaf pine oleoresin by first dissolving it in a solution of acetone and 2-amino-2-methyl-1-propanol , then acidifying with phosphoric acid .
Biosynthesis
The abietane-like skeleton of levopimaric acid is formed by the cyclization of a diterpenoid precursor , geranylgeranyl diphosphate , from which C20 isoprenoids are typically derived . The intermediate which is formed , ( + ) -copalyl diphosphate , then goes through an oxidation and rearrangement to give levopimaradiene . Then , the levopimaradiene goes through several more steps of oxidation processes via the intermediates levopimaradienol and levepimaradienal to give levopimaric acid .
Role in biology
Oleoresin in pines is defined as pine gum , which is the nonaqueous secretion of resin acids dissolved in a terpene hydrocarbon oil , which is produced in or exuded from the intercellular resin ducts of a living tree . The viscous oleoresin secretion is composed of a complex mixture of terpenoids , consisting of roughly equal parts of volatile turpentine and rosin ( also known as diterpene resin acids ) . Accumulated resin is released upon tissue injury and/or produced locally at the site of infestation , with the consequence that the beetle and associated fungal pathogens are killed , encased in resin , and expelled from the borehole point of entry . This process is called pitching out , and it results in not only killing the attackers and flushing the wound site but also moving the oleoresin to the trunk surface where the turpentine evaporates to permit the resin acids to form a formidable physical barrier that seals the wound . Diterpene resin acids ( DRA ) play important roles in confer defense against insects and microbial pathogens . Levopimaric acid , an abietane-type DRA , is one of the principal resin acids .

Weld County is a county located in the U.S. state of Colorado . As of the 2020 census , the population was 328,981 . The county seat is Greeley .
Weld County comprises the Greeley , CO Metropolitan Statistical Area , which is included in the Denver–Aurora , CO Combined Statistical Area .
History
On May 30 , 1854 , the Kansas–Nebraska Act created the Nebraska Territory and the Kansas Territory , divided by the Parallel 40° North ( Baseline Road or County Line Road or Weld County Road 2 in the future Weld County ) . Present-day Weld County , Colorado , lay in the southwestern portion of the Nebraska Territory , bordering the Kansas Territory .
In July 1858 , gold was discovered along the South Platte River in Arapahoe County , Kansas Territory . This discovery precipitated the Pike 's Peak Gold Rush . Many residents of the mining region felt disconnected from the remote territorial governments of Kansas and Nebraska , so they voted to form their own Territory of Jefferson on October 24 , 1859 . The following month , the Jefferson Territorial Legislature organized 12 counties for the new territory , including St. Vrain County . St. Vrain County was named in honor of Ceran de Hault de Lassus de St. Vrain , the French trader who established the first trading post on the upper South Platte River . St. Vrain County encompassed much of what is today Weld County .
The Jefferson Territory never received federal sanction , but on February 28 , 1861 , U.S. President James Buchanan signed an act organizing the Territory of Colorado . On November 1 , 1861 , the Colorado General Assembly organized 17 counties , including Weld County , for the new Colorado Territory . Weld County was named for Lewis Ledyard Weld , a lawyer and territorial secretary . They died while serving in the Union Army during the Civil War . Until February 9 , 1887 , Weld County 's boundaries included the area now comprising Weld County , Washington County , Logan County , Morgan County , Yuma County , Phillips County , and Sedgwick County .
Weld County was thrust into the media spotlight on the evening of November 1 , 1955 , when United Airlines Flight 629 , a Douglas DC-6B airliner flying from Denver to Portland , Oregon , exploded in midair and crashed , killing all 44 persons on board the plane and scattering bodies , wreckage and debris over a six-square-mile area of the county . The subsequent investigation of the accident revealed that Denver resident John Gilbert Graham had secretly placed a time bomb composed of 25 sticks of dynamite in a suitcase belonging to their mother , who was a passenger on the airplane . Graham was tried and convicted of the crime , and executed in 1957 .
In northeastern Weld County , Minuteman III missile silo `` N-8 '' , one of the many unmanned silos there , was the target of symbolic vandalism by Catholic peace activists in 2002 .
Weld County also holds the distinction of having more confirmed tornado sightings than any other U.S. county from 1950 to 2011 , with 252 confirmed reports .
On March 6 , 2019 , the county declared itself to be a Second Amendment sanctuary .
Secession proposals
In 2013 , conservative Weld County commissioners began a campaign to secede from the State of Colorado to create a new state ; a state ballot measure regarding the issue was put on the November 2013 ballot . The legality of this initiative has been questioned by local attorneys . On Nov 5th , 2013 , 6 out of 11 Colorado counties voted no for secession , including Weld County . Elbert , Lincoln , Logan , Moffat , Sedgwick , and Weld counties voted no , while Cheyenne , Kit Carson , Phillips , Washington , and Yuma counties voted yes . `` Weld County voters said this is an option we should n't pursue and we wo n't pursue it , '' said Weld County Commissioner Sean Conway , `` But we will continue to look at the problems of the urban and rural divide in this state . ''
In 2021 , a group known as `` Weld County , WY '' organized a petition to place a measure on the November 2021 ballot for the county to secede from Colorado to join Wyoming , due to a clash between the conservative politics of Weld County and the liberal government of Colorado . Mark Gordon , the Governor of Wyoming , said when asked about the topic , `` We would love that . '' In response to Gordon 's comment , Colorado Governor Jared Polis said , `` Hands off Weld County . ''
Geography
According to the U.S. Census Bureau , the county has a total area of , of which are land and ( 0.7 % ) are water . It is the third-largest county in Colorado by area .
Weld County lies within the relatively flat eastern portion of Colorado ; the northeastern portions of the county contain the extensive Pawnee National Grassland and the Pawnee Buttes , which jut above the surrounding terrain and are surrounded by many small canyons and outcroppings . Along the western border , hilly areas indicate the presence of the foothills of the Rocky Mountains further west .
The county is served by two interstate highways : I-25 ( US 87 ) runs through the southwestern corner and I-76 from the south central edge northeastward to the Morgan county border . Other major roads include US 85 and US 34 , which intersect near Greeley , and State Highway 14 , which runs through Ault .

Something for the Rest of Us is the ninth studio album by American rock band Goo Goo Dolls . It was released on August 28 , 2010 in Australia and on August 31 in North America through Warner Bros. Records . The recording process took place during the spring to fall of 2009 in the GCR Audio studio in Buffalo and Paramount Studios as well as `` the Ark '' in Los Angeles , with producer Tim Palmer . A single had been originally slated to be released in November 2009 with an album release in February 2010 , but the band went back into the studio in January 2010 . According to lead singer and guitarist John Rzeznik , this was done to make further improvements on what they had previously thought had been a finished record . Several producers were brought in to assist on the production process , including Butch Vig , John Fields , Paul David Hager and Rob Cavallo . Something for the Rest of Us is the third Goo Goo Dolls studio album that Cavallo has produced ( Dizzy Up the Girl and Gutterflower ) . When asked about the length of time between albums , Rzeznik admitted it was a mix of songwriting issues as well as taking time out for personal reasons ; `` I wanted to really dig deep and there are a million songs I threw away , like , “ Nah , it 's not good enough . I wan na do something different . I wan na do something better , go deeper . I also wanted to have a life with my girlfriend for a while . I owed it to them to spend some time with them and be normal and be in one place . That was kind of important . '' In one of the Ustream sessions , Robby revealed that the album would have twelve songs and `` Real '' is not among them . In late May , John announced that `` Home '' would be the first single and was released onto radio and iTunes stores on June 8 , 2010 .
On July 13 , 2010 , it was announced on the band 's fan club website , Inner Machine , that an EP will be available to purchase at all remaining tour dates . The EP is titled Waiting for the Rest of It and it contains 4 new songs from Something for the Rest of Us plus a live recording of `` Broadway '' from the Something for the Rest of Us Tour .
Themes
In an interview with Star News Online , Rzeznik revealed that the band would explore some of the issues of the present day lyrically ; `` Most of the material on the record seems to be addressing the kind of the angst and uncertainty of the times that we 're living in , but on an emotional level . One particular song on the album is called “ Notbroken. ” I got a letter from a woman whose husband was in Iraq . They were injured – paralyzed – and they do n't want to come home . They want to stay in the hospital . He 's ashamed of himself . They feel like he 's less . And they just wants to let them know that he 's still everything that they ever wanted . I do n't know , it just kind of came out . It 's kind of like I was writing a love letter to them on their behalf . These are really hard , trying times . And the way that affects people and their families , people losing their jobs and everything 's so insecure , I just wanted to say something about that . ''
Reception
Something for the Rest of Us has received mixed to favorable reviews . Collating 8 reviews , the review aggregator website Metacritic gave the album an average score of 59 % , which indicated a `` mixed or average '' response .
Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic awarded the album three stars out of five , opining that the album `` delivers in its content if not in its sound . '' They did offer praise to the albums overall `` ambition '' , summarizing that , `` While the band remains much closer to the warm AAA bath that 's become their defining signature , the added ambition does give Something for the Rest of Us variety that 's welcome after the exceedingly pleasant Let Love In . ''
BBC Music writer Mike Diver gave a mixed review , albeit praising the band for playing to their `` established strengths . '' Despite this , they went on to add that , `` So easy on the ear , indeed , that maintaining focus can be difficult . John Rzeznik 's gruff tones are always the scene-stealing element of any track , but when he 's barking out well-worn clichés about love and loss , it 's a task to read between tired lines and hear some heart . Several tracks are n't so much dripping with weak metaphors as drowning in them . ''
Blog Critics writer Kirsten Coachman was more receptive in their article on the album . They said that the record was , `` proof why the Goo Goo Dolls remain popular with music fans . They know their audience , and even better , they know how to relate to their audience through their music . '' They praised the band for still being able to `` rock a love song '' , while offering particular praise to album closer `` Soldier '' . They added , `` The final song rounds out the album with its lyrics that could make you feel like the song is being sung directly to you . ''
Inner Ear Media summed up the band 's achievements to date in order to judge how the new record holds up . They conclude that the band has been able to consistently produce strong mainstream pop/rock albums over the past decade and that the new album fits in that mold . While it does n't offer anything revolutionary it solidifies the Goo Goo Dolls ' status as one of the world 's finest pop/rock bands .
Dan Slessor of Kerrang ! magazine was also favorable in their review , awarding the album a `` good '' three K ! score . They wrote that `` anthemic American radio rock really does n't come much better than that of the Goo Goo Dolls . '' They offered praise for the `` giant hooks '' found among the songs , as well as the band showing a `` ton of heart '' , despite the `` polished '' production .
Q magazine also awarded the album three stars out of five , noting `` there 's enough here to satisfy the faithful , if nothing to enlist new recruits . ''
Barry Walters of Rolling Stone was more dismissive however , criticizing Rzeznik . They wrote , `` frontman John Rzeznik remains an assured singer . But amid their vocal polish is a new sense of strain , and for a band this lightweight , the additional anxiety does n't flatter . ''
Kathy Stephenson , writing for the Salt Lake Tribune , was highly impressed with the album and offered a grade of `` A− '' . They opined that , `` All 12 tracks offer the rich themes , smart lyrics and rock-worthy melodies that have made this trio a favorite for more than two decades . ''
The College at Brockport 's student newspaper , the stylus , also gave a positive review . Bryan Montgomery scored the album at seven out of ten . Despite viewing the album as `` merely a shadow to the great albums in the past '' , they praised the songwriting by pointing out that , `` With every new album , it seems that [ Rzeznik 's ] writing becomes stronger , and Something For the Rest of Us is an album where the writing is a key piece to what makes the songs sound so good . The sound on the album is truly reminiscent of what the band has become so well-known for in the last few years . ''

In 2010 Meow Meow was awarded the Edinburgh Festival Fringe Prize . In January 2011 they premiered `` Meow Meow in Concert '' for three nights at the Apollo Theatre on London 's West End .

Style
Gray performs a style of cabaret that has been called `` kamikaze cabaret '' . They may stagger onto the stage , appear later than scheduled , experience wardrobe malfunctions , shout unexpected things , and interact with audience members . However , `` ... this is a polished presentation of the spectacle of failure – a ruse that underlines the necessary collaboration between performer and audience , and creates a shabby frame within which Meow Meow 's exquisite voice can shine all the brighter '' , as written in a 2018 Guardian article .

Excerpts from the poem
After lunch
when the files had ceased buzzing
over the food-littered floor
and the air was still and heavy
when only the soft plop
of drops from a leaky tap
broke the quiet
* * * * *
my wrinkled grandmother
would ask me to comb
their long wet hair
and as the comb furrowed
through the dark shining mass
and the smell of their coconut hair oil
* * * * *
their lips would tell me
of how an illiterate peasant
had obtained the gift of rhymes
from the Goddess Saraswati
of how the new-born Krishna
escaped the wrath of a jealous king
* * * * *
I would look on
with sleep-drunk eyes
as they recited Sanskrit verse
in a grating sandpapery voice
and when their eyes closed in comfort
and their breathing became as rhythmic
as the poetry they had chanted
through the long lazy afternoon ,
I would tiptoe
Up to the old wall clock
to see
if time had stopped .

The Committee Against Bird Slaughter ( CABS ) is an NGO established in 1975 in Germany to advocate against the illegal poaching of migratory birds in Europe . They claim to be the only organization in Europe with this specialization . They aid in removing traps , monitoring hunters , lobbying parliament on issues , and supporting relevant police efforts . In collaboration with other organizations CABS they have bird protection camps around hotspots of poaching .
1970-2000s
A small group of bird conservationists were inspired by circulating bird poaching photos in the 1970s , and established CABS in 1975 . They created a campaign called `` No vacation where birds are murdered '' to hinder tourism in areas in Italy that had large amounts of bird hunting . Further campaigns ensued and over the years numerous bird species gained governmental protections and the EU Birds Directive due to the actions of CABS and similar groups . In 1980 they launched a campaign against bird trapping in Belgium and pigeon shooting competitions in Florence . Such protests led to bans and regulations placed in 1984 . The early 80 's carried a focus on wild bird trade in Germany through covert monitoring in underground trading . Illegal bird farms were closed down after a CABS advertising campaign upon discovery .
2000 's - Present
There are instances such as one in 2017 where members of CABS have been violently attacked by hunters .
Starting in 2017 CABS in congregation with the Society for the Protection of Nature in Lebanon lobbied Lebanon 's government for stricter anti-poaching laws .
In August 2019 CABS discovered eight illegal underwater birds trapping sites through a major reconnaissance operation .
Due to reduced police resources during the 2020 Coronavirus pandemic , CABS has had reduced effectivity on a surge in poachers . They had to close down most bird protection camps and operations .

David McKenna and Nick Cassavetes adapted Bruce Porter 's 1993 book Blow : How a Small Town Boy Made $ 100 Million with the Medellín Cocaine Cartel and Lost It All for the screenplay . It is based on the real-life stories of U.S. drug trafficker George Jung ( played by Johnny Depp ) and their connections including narcotics kings Pablo Escobar and Carlos Lehder Rivas ( portrayed in the film as Diego Delgado ) , and the Medellín Cartel .
Plot
A young George Jung and their parents Fred and Ermine live in Weymouth , Massachusetts . When George is 10 years old , Fred files for bankruptcy , but tries to make George realize that money is not important .
As an adult , George moves to Los Angeles with their friend `` Tuna '' ; they meet Barbara , a flight attendant , who introduces them to Derek Foreal , a marijuana dealer . With Derek 's help , George and Tuna make a lot of money . Kevin Dulli , a visiting college student from Boston , tells them of the demand for marijuana back home . They start selling marijuana there , buying marijuana directly from Mexico with the help of Santiago Sanchez , a Mexican drug lord . Two years later , George is caught in Chicago trying to import of marijuana and is sentenced to two years ' imprisonment . After unsuccessfully trying to plead their innocence , George skips bail to take care of Barbara , who dies from cancer . Them death marks the disbanding of the group of friends .
While hiding from the authorities , George visits their parents . George 's mother calls the police , who arrest him . They are sentenced to 26 months in a federal prison in Danbury , Connecticut . Their cellmate Diego Delgado has contacts in the Medellin cartel and convinces George to help them go into the cocaine business . Upon their release from prison , George violates their parole conditions and heads down to Cartagena , Colombia to meet with Diego . They meet with cartel officer Cesar Rosa to negotiate the terms for smuggling to establish `` good faith '' .
As the smuggling operation grows , Diego is arrested , leaving George to find a way to sell . George reconnects with Derek in California , and the two sell all the cocaine . George then goes to Medellín , Colombia and meets Pablo Escobar , who agrees to go into business with them . With the help of Derek , the pair become Escobar 's top U.S. importer . At Diego 's wedding , George meets Cesar 's fiancée Mirtha and later marries them However , Diego resents George for keeping Derek 's identity secret and pressures George to reveal their connection . George eventually discovers that Diego has betrayed them by cutting them out of the connection with Derek . Inspired by the birth of their daughter and a drug-related heart attack , George severs their relationship with the cartel .
All goes well with George 's newfound civilian life for five years , until Mirtha organizes a 38th birthday party for him . Many of their former drug associates attend , including Derek , who reveals that Diego eventually cut them out as well . The FBI and DEA raid the party and arrest George . They become a fugitive , and their bank account—heretofore under Manuel Noriega 's protection in Panama—is seized by Noriega . One night , they and Mirtha get into a fight while driving . They are pulled over by police and Mirtha tells them George is a fugitive and has stashed a kilogram of cocaine in their trunk . They are sent to jail for three years , Mirtha divorces him , and takes custody of their nine-year-old daughter , Kristina Sunshine Jung .
Upon their release , George struggles to maintain their relationship with their daughter . They promise Kristina a vacation in California and seeks one last deal to garner enough money for the trip . George completes a deal with former accomplices but learns too late that the deal had been set up by the FBI and DEA , with Dulli and Derek having leaked the nature and location of the action in exchange for pardons for their involvement in their prior action . George is sentenced to 60 years at Otisville Correctional Facility in upstate New York . They explain in the end that neither the sentence nor the betrayal bothered him , but that they can never forgive themselves for having to break a promise to their daughter .
While in prison , George requests a furlough to see their dying father , Fred . Their mother denies the request . George records a final message to Fred , recounting their memories of working with their father , their run-ins with the law , and finally , too late , their understanding of what Fred meant when they said that money is not `` real '' . An old man in prison , George imagines that their daughter finally comes to visit him . They slowly fade away as a guard calls for George . The film concludes with notes indicating that Jung will not be eligible for parole until 2015 , and that their daughter has yet to visit him .

Reception
Blow performed below expectations at the box office . With a budget of roughly $ 53 million , it managed to earn just under $ 53 million domestically , but raised just over $ 30 million internationally for a worldwide total of $ 83,282,296 .
The film holds an approval rating of 55 % at Rotten Tomatoes , based on 141 reviews , with a weighted average score of 5.8/10 . The site 's consensus is : `` With elements that seem borrowed from movies like Goodfellas and Boogie Nights , Blow is pretty much been-there-done-that despite another excellent performance from Johnny Depp . It , also , becomes too sentimental at the end . '' On Metacritic , the film has a weighted average score of 52 out of 100 , based on 34 critics , indicating `` mixed or average reviews '' . Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of `` A- '' on an A+ to F scale . Penélope Cruz was nominated for the Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Actress for their performances in Blow as well as Captain Corelli 's Mandolin and Vanilla Sky .
Rob Gonsalves from eFilmCritic.com gave the film 4 out of 5 stars stating : `` Blow is n't really a classic , but it 's a sobering story well-told . '' Roger Ebert gave the film 2½ out of 4 stars , but questioned the value of making Jung the subject of this film , stating : `` That 's the thing about George [ Jung ] . They think it 's all about him . Their life , their story , their success , their fortune , theirs lost fortune , their good luck , their bad luck . Actually , all they did was operate a toll gate between suppliers and addicts . You wonder , but you never find out , if the reality of those destroyed lives ever occurred to him . '' David Nusair of Reel Films also questioned making a film about Jung , stating `` The biggest problem with Blow is that Jung is such a complete moron . '' Nusair concludes that while it `` is not a bad film ... the central character of George Jung just does n't seem worthy to be the center of attention . '' Christopher Smith from Bangor Daily News gave the film a `` D+ '' , stating `` Blow is ultimately more about charisma than it is about truth , more about Depp 's smooth strut and tousled hair than it is about George Jung 's fatal flaws—his stupidity , desperation , ego and small-town greed .

Jerotej Sokolović also Jeortej , Serbian Patriarch was the archbishop of the Serbian Patriarchate of Peć and the Serbian patriarch from 1589 to 1591 . They succeeded Patriarch Nikanor I on the throne of the Serbian Patriarchate . They spent a very short time as a Serbian patriarch . They were succeeded by Patriarch Filip I .
There are almost no other data about Patriarch Jerotej except for two records . The inscription on the mine , which was left in Šišatovac by the scribe hieromonk Georgije , in 1589 , says that `` it was transcribed in the days of the consecrated archbishop , father and teacher of Serbs and Bulgarians and many other parts of Bishop Cyrus Jerotej '' .
From the inscription in the manuscript type of the monastery of Orahovica , which was transcribed in the time of Metropolitan kyr-Vasilije of Požega and Patriarch Jerotej , it can be seen that the patriarch managed the house of Saint Sava well because it is said about Kyr-Jerotej :
Patriarch Jerotej died on 17 February 1591 .

Over the course of its history , the LGBT community has adopted certain symbols for self-identification to demonstrate unity , pride , shared values , and allegiance to one another . These symbols communicate ideas , concepts , and identity both within their communities and to mainstream culture . The two symbols most recognized internationally are the pink triangle and the rainbow flag .
Letters and glyphs
Gender symbols
The female and male gender symbols are derived from the astronomical symbols for the planets Venus and Mars respectively . Following Linnaeus , biologists use the planetary symbol for Venus to represent the female sex , and the planetary symbol for Mars to represent the male sex .
Two interlocking female symbols ( ⚢ ) represent a lesbian or the lesbian community , and two interlocking male symbols ( ⚣ ) a gay male or the gay male community . These symbols first appeared in the 1970s .
The combined male-female symbol ( ⚦ ) is used to represent androgyne or transgender people ; and when additionally combined with the female ( ♀ ) and male ( ♂ ) symbols ( ⚧ ) it indicates gender inclusivity , though it is also used as a transgender symbol .
Lambda
In 1970 , graphic designer Tom Doerr selected the lower-case Greek letter lambda ( λ ) to be the symbol of the New York chapter of the Gay Activists Alliance . The alliance 's literature states that Doerr chose the symbol specifically for its denotative meaning in the context of chemistry and physics : `` a complete exchange of energy–that moment or span of time witness to absolute activity '' .
The lambda became associated with Gay Liberation , and in December 1974 , it was officially declared the international symbol for gay and lesbian rights by the International Gay Rights Congress in Edinburgh , Scotland . The gay rights organization Lambda Legal and the American Lambda Literary Foundation derive their names from this symbol .
Plants and animals
In 19th-century England , green indicated homosexual affiliations , as popularized by gay author Oscar Wilde , who often wore a green carnation on their lapel . According to some interpretations , American poet Walt Whitman used the sweet flag plant to represent homoerotic male love because of its phallic connotations .
The term , `` rose '' in Japanese , has historically been used in Japan as a pejorative for men who love men , roughly equivalent to the English language term `` pansy '' . Beginning in the 1960s , the term was reappropriated by Japanese gay media : notably with the 1961 anthology , a collection of semi-nude photographs of homosexual writer Yukio Mishima by photographer Eikoh Hosoe , and later with in 1971 , the first commercially produced gay magazine in Asia . The use of the rose as a prominent symbol of love between males is supposedly derived from the Greek myth of King Laius having affairs with boys under rose trees . Since the 2000s , bara has been used by non-Japanese audience as an umbrella term to describe a wide variety of Japanese and non-Japanese gay media featuring love and sex between masculine men . The rose is also the sacred flower of Eros , the Greek god of love and sex , and patron of love between men . Eros was responsible for the first rose to sprout on Earth , followed by every flower and herb . Roses are a symbol of pederasty in ancient Greece : handsome boys were metaphorically called roses by their male admirers in homoerotic poems such as those by Solon , Straton , Meleager , Rhianus , and Philostratos .
Animals that lovers gave as gifts to their beloved also became symbols of pederastic love , such as hares , roosters , deer , felines and oxen , as a metaphor for sexual pursuits .
Violets and their color became a special code used by lesbians and bisexual women . The symbolism of the flower derives from several fragments of poems by Sappho in which they describe a lover wearing garlands or a crown with violets . In 1926 , the play La Prisonnière by Édouard Bourdet used a bouquet of violets to signify lesbian love . When the play became subject to censorship , many Parisian lesbians wore violets to demonstrate solidarity with its lesbian subject matter .
White lilies have been used since the Romantic era of Japanese literature to symbolize beauty and purity in women , and are a de facto symbol of the yuri genre ( translates literally to `` lily '' ) , which describes the portrayal of intimate love , sex , or emotional connections between women . The term was coined in 1976 by , editor of the gay men 's magazine Barazoku ( see above ) , to refer to their female readers . While not all those women were lesbians , and it is unclear whether this was the first instance of the term yuri in this context , an association of yuri with lesbianism subsequently developed . In Korea and China , `` lily '' is used as a semantic loan from the Japanese usage to describe female-female romance media , where each use the direct translation of the term – baekhap ( 백합 ) in Korea and bǎihé ( 百合 ) in China .
Lavender rhinoceros
Daniel Thaxton and Bernie Toale created a lavender rhinoceros symbol for a public ad campaign to increase visibility for gay people in Boston helmed by Gay Media Action-Advertising ; Toale said they chose a rhinoceros because `` it is a much maligned and misunderstood animal '' and that it was lavender because that is a mix of pink and blue , making it a symbolic merger of the feminine and masculine . However , in May 1974 , Metro Transit Advertising said its lawyers could not `` determine eligibility of the public service rate '' for the lavender rhinoceros ads , which tripled the cost of the ad campaign . Gay Media Action challenged this , but were unsuccessful . The lavender rhinoceros symbol was seen on signs , pins , and t-shirts at the Boston Pride Parade later in 1974 , and a life-sized papier-mâché lavender rhinoceros was part of the parade . Money was raised for the ads , and they began running on the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority 's Green Line by December 3 , 1974 , and ran there until February 1975 . The lavender rhinoceros continued as a symbol of the gay community , appearing at the 1976 Boston Pride Parade and on a flag that was raised at Boston City Hall in 1987 .
Unicorns
Unicorns have become a symbol of LGBT culture due to earlier associations between the animal and rainbows being extended to the rainbow flag created in 1978 by Gilbert Baker .
Alice Fisher of The Guardian wrote in 2017 , `` The unicorn has also done its bit for the LGBT community in the last century ... Rainbows and unicorns are so intrinsically linked ( the association is also a Victorian invention ) that it 's unsurprising that the magic creature started to appear on T-shirts and banners at Gay Pride around the world , with slogans such as 'Gender is Imaginary ' or 'Totally Straight ' emblazoned under sparkling rainbow unicorns . ''
Gay Star News has said unicorns are `` queer icons of our time '' .
Triangle badges of Nazi Germany
One of the oldest of these symbols is the downward-pointing pink triangle that male homosexuals in Nazi concentration camps were required to wear on their clothing . The badge is one of several badges that internees wore to identify what kind of prisoners they were . Many of the estimated 5,000–15,000 gay men imprisoned in concentration camps did not survive . The pink triangle was later reclaimed by gay men , as well as some lesbians , in various political movements as a symbol of personal pride and remembrance . AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power ( ACT-UP ) adopted the downward-pointing pink triangle to symbolize the `` active fight back '' against HIV/AIDS `` rather than a passive resignation to fate . ''
The pink triangle was used exclusively with male prisoners , as lesbians were not included under Paragraph 175 , a statute which made homosexual acts between males a crime . Lesbian sexual relations were illegal only in Austria and historians differ on whether they were persecuted or not , due to lack of evidence . Some lesbians were imprisoned with a black triangle symbolizing supposed `` asociality '' , this symbol was later reclaimed by postwar lesbians .
Other symbols
Symbols of the LGBT community have been used to represent members ' unity , pride , shared values , and allegiance to one another .
Ace symbols
The ace ring , a black ring ( also known as an ace ring ) worn on the middle finger of one 's right hand is a way asexual people signify their asexuality . The ring is deliberately worn in a similar manner as one would a wedding ring to symbolize marriage . Use of the symbol began in 2005 .
Ace playing cards , due to the phonetic shortening from asexual to ace , ace playing cards are sometimes used to represent asexuality . The ace of hearts and ace of spades are used to symbolize romantic asexuality and aromantic asexuality respectively . Likewise , the ace of clubs is used to symbolize gray asexuality and gray aromantics , and the ace of diamonds is used to symbolize demi-romantics and demisexuals .
Blue feather
In the Society for Creative Anachronism , LGBT members often wear a dark blue feather to indicate an affiliation with Clan Blue Feather , a group of SCA members promoting the study of LGBT culture and people in the Middle Ages . Because of this affiliation , blue feathers have also been used at some Renaissance Faires and Pagan events .
Freedom rings
Freedom rings , designed by David Spada and released in 1991 , are six aluminum rings , each in one of the colors of the rainbow flag . Symbolizing happiness and diversity , these rings are worn by themselves or as part of necklaces , bracelets , and key chains . They are sometimes referred to as `` Fruit Loops '' .
Handkerchief code
In some New York City gay circles of the early 20th century , gay men wore a red necktie or bow tie as a subtle signal . In the 1970s , the handkerchief ( or hanky ) code emerged in the form of bandanas , worn in back pockets , in colors that signaled sexual interests , fetishes , and if the wearer was a `` top '' or `` bottom '' .
High five
There are many origin stories of the high five , but the two most documented candidates are Dusty Baker and Glenn Burke of the Los Angeles Dodgers professional baseball team on October 2 , 1977 , and Wiley Brown and Derek Smith of the Louisville Cardinals men 's basketball team during the 1978–1979 season . In any case , after retiring from baseball , Burke , who was one of the first openly gay professional athletes , used the high five with other gay residents of the Castro district of San Francisco , where for many it became a symbol of gay pride and identification .
Purple hand
On October 31 , 1969 , sixty members of the Gay Liberation Front , the Committee for Homosexual Freedom ( CHF ) , and the Gay Guerilla Theatre group staged a protest outside the offices of the San Francisco Examiner in response to a series of news articles disparaging people in San Francisco 's gay bars and clubs . The peaceful protest against the Examiner turned tumultuous and was later called `` Friday of the Purple Hand '' and `` Bloody Friday of the Purple Hand '' . Examiner employees `` dumped a barrel of printers ' ink on the crowd from the roof of the newspaper building '' , according to glbtq.com . Some reports state that it was a barrel of ink poured from the roof of the building . The protestors `` used the ink to scrawl slogans on the building walls '' and slap purple hand prints `` throughout downtown [ San Francisco ] '' resulting in `` one of the most visible demonstrations of gay power '' according to the Bay Area Reporter . According to Larry LittleJohn , then president of Society for Individual Rights , `` At that point , the tactical squad arrived – not to get the employees who dumped the ink , but to arrest the demonstrators . Somebody could have been hurt if that ink had gotten into their eyes , but the police were knocking people to the ground . '' The accounts of police brutality include women being thrown to the ground and protesters ' teeth being knocked out . Inspired by Black Hand extortion methods of Camorra gangsters and the Mafia , some gay and lesbian activists attempted to institute `` purple hand '' as a warning to stop anti-gay attacks , but with little success . In Turkey , the LGBT rights organization ( Purple Hand Eskişehir LGBT Formation ) , also bears the name of this symbol .
White Knot
The White Knot is a symbol of support for same-sex marriage in the United States . The White Knot combines two symbols of marriage , the color white and `` tying the knot '' to represent support for same-sex marriage . The White Knot has been worn publicly by many celebrities as a means of demonstrating solidarity with that cause .
The White Knot was created by Frank Voci in November 2008 , in response to the passage of Proposition 8 in California and bans on same-sex marriage and denial of other civil rights for LGBT persons across the nation .

Mohammed Nabi Yusufi ( 1923–2005 ) was an Imam of the Afghan community in New York City .
In Afghanistan
Mohammed Nabi Yusufi was born in Kandahar , Afghanistan on 10 March 1923 . Mohammed Nabi Yusufi was born to an ethnic Pashtun and Akhounzada Khail family . Yusufi had a burgeoning export business in Afghanistan ; they had homes both in the capital Kabul and their home town of Kandahar . Yusufi fled Afghanistan with their family shortly after the Russians invaded Afghanistan in 1979 .
Mohammed Nabi Yusufi held a post in King Zahir Shah 's government as an emir and due to their successful business and worldly knowledge they were elected as the president of the Kandahar chamber of commerce , as well the mayor of Zabol .
They traveled extensively throughout the world due to their business and brought new ideas and teachings back to Afghanistan . They spoke five languages that included Pashto , Dari , Arabic , Urdu , and English . They lectured at hundreds of meetings , gatherings , and sermons . Yusufi was instrumental in the preservation of the Afghan culture and Islam for Afghans that were resettling in New York . This made life easier for the many Afghan immigrants that were adjusting to the new country they now called home , the United States .
Outlook
Mohammed Nabi Yusufi , despite coming from a religious , spiritual family known as the Akhounzada Khail , was a very modern man inside the conservative Islamic circles that existed in Kandahar and the U.S . They carried the same modern outlook and moderate views throughout their entire life while remaining connected to their faith . Those who knew them have said that they were an extraordinary leader during a critical era in the history of the Afghan people . They were a pioneer in the creation of the Afghan community in the western world for decades while publicly raising support for the millions of Afghans whose lives were affected by the Russian invasion inside of Afghanistan . In 1980 during a short stay in Pakistan Yusufi exhausted some effort to assist the Afghan freedom fighters . They wanted to remove Afghanistan from the claws of the Russians ; however , they soon realized that these groups in Pakistan had their own political agendas which they did not want to be a part of and decided to work towards the freedom of Afghanistan from the United States .
Response to Russian invasion
During a time when the world did not know much about Afghanistan Mohammed Nabi Yusufi led groups to the United Nations to raise awareness about the Russian invasion into Afghanistan and to bring attention to the thousands of innocent Afghans that were being killed by the Soviet Union in the early 1980s . In 1985 Yusufi was asked to be the spiritual and community leader by several Afghans residing in New York City who began to realize that the settlement of Afghans in the area was increasing and they had no center for religious and cultural services . They selflessly served as the Imam of the Masjid e Syed Jamaluddin e Afghani in Queens , New York which doubles as a community center . As the Imam in New York they dealt with numerous needs inside the Afghan community and cared for all people who asked for their guidance with genuine concern for their needs .
Illness and death
Days after heading the eid prayer for thousands , On November 8 , 2005 , Yusufi suddenly suffered a heart attack on which doctors at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York performed a successful angioplasty . Yusufi was in fine health with no indications of heart disease prior to this heart attack . Yusufi died on November 28 , 2005 , from pulmonary edema which occurred as a result of the original cardiogenic shock that they suffered twenty days before their death on the morning of November 8 , 2005 .
There was a sudden outpouring of sadness and grief amongst the Afghan community that they served for so long . The relationship the Afghan community members had with them was of mutual respect and affection . Members of the Afghan community have said that they were a very knowledgeable man who was very fair and moderate in their views and a devout Muslim whom they viewed as a caring father figure who brought people together , and that such a man is inimitable .
During the funeral services that took place at the Masjid e Syed Jamaluddin e Afghani on a rainy day in December , the mosque was heavily packed with people , and every few minutes people were asked to leave to make room for the next round of people to have a chance to come inside the mosque for the service . People were standing in crowds outside in the cold rain for hours . It is said that you know your value by the number of people who attend your funeral . For Yusufi , their funeral exemplified that they were held in extremely high regard . When Mohammed Nabi Yusufi was asked which side they were on they would often reply `` I do n't have a side , I am on the side of justice and truth '' .
`` Mohammed Nabi Yusufi , arguably the most admired and enduring leader within the Afghan community in Queens and citywide , died of congestive lung failure Nov. 28 . They were 82 .
For nearly 25 years Yusufi served as the spiritual imam of the Flushing Afghan mosque , Masjid e Syed Jamaluddin e Afghani . But in that role , their children said , their father inspired and united brethren from all Afghan tribes . `` He brought everyone together , from all the mosques , '' said Hamid Yusufi , 32 , one of the imam 's 10 children , during a four-hour funeral service Sunday at the mosque on 149th Street . An immigrant from Kandahar , which they and their family left after the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979 , Yusufi , focused their leadership in Queens on rebuilding a prosperous and peaceful Afghanistan while offering guidance and hope to some 20,000 Afghans who live in New York City . ''
`` He was a more political rather than a religious influence to many people , '' said Ahmad Yusufi , another son , referring to Afghanistan 's conflict with the Soviets . Their ultimate goal , they said , was `` to bring peace and prosperity to Afghanistan , unite Afghans here and promote education . '' Indeed , a characteristic that distinguished Yusufi from other more traditional Afghan leaders was their propensity to encourage women to become educated , saying Islamic law did not prohibit it . `` It would haunt him , '' Ahmad said , about the conservative Taliban regime 's opposition to women 's education . All six of their daughters received higher schooling , including their eldest , Latifa , who became a Fulbright scholar and ultimately a university professor . Through their mosque , Yusufi also set up the Afghan Immigrant Islamic Center , a resettlement service to help immigrants with family counseling , documentation and marriages . `` People would call my father at 3 a.m. with questions , '' Ahmad said . `` If they did n't have the answer , he 'd look it up . They did n't have a private life . They were dedicated to the public . They were at their service . '' As a measure of their popularity , the day the Imam died the Afghan community took over all funeral expenses , Ahmad said . But when money was sent to a funeral home in Queens and the Washington Memorial Cemetery in Long Island , both places returned the checks .

Lysøen is an island in Bjørnafjorden in Vestland county , Norway .
Lysøen is also the site of Villa Lysøen ( Ole Bulls villa på Lysøen ) , the home of Norwegian violin-virtuoso and composer Ole Bull until their death in 1880 .
Villa Lysøen
The island was originally the site of a farm established around 1670 . The island was bought by Ole Bull in 1872 who constructed the villa . Ole Bull drew the plans for the villa himself , under the supervision of renowned Norwegian architect Conrad Fredrik von der Lippe ( 1833–1901 ) . Ole Bull had a large villa built on the island , inspired by numerous architectural styles , including the Swiss chalet style and Moorish architecture . It has a tower formed as an onion dome , common in Russian architecture , and many wooden carvings .
Ole Bull transformed their island property into a fairy-tale kingdom by having romantic paths , ponds and gazebos made by planting exotic trees and bushes in the native pine forest . The island has 13 km of walkways and paths . Their second wife Sara Chapman Thorp ( 1850–1911 ) accompanied them to their summer villa on Lysøen .
The highest point on the island , 76 meters above sea level , is the site of a lookout tower which was built in 1903 by Ole Bull 's American descendants . In 1974 , Bull 's granddaughter Sylvea Bull Curtis of Connecticut donated the island to the Society for the Preservation of Ancient Norwegian Monuments . Lysøen granted status as a museum in 1984 and has since been open to the public . Guided tours are conducted from early May to August . The villa serves as a museum in the summer and is used for concerts during the annual Bergen International Festival .

Rabbi Elimelech Szapira of Grodzhisk ( 1823–1892 ) was the leading Hasidic rebbe of their time in Poland . They were a ( follower ) of the Rizhiner Rebbe . After the death of their father , the Sorof of Mogelnica , they assumed leadership of the Grodzhisk chasidim , who eventually numbered in the tens of thousands .
Their sons-in-law were the Kozhnitser Rebbe Yaakov Yechiel Hopsztajn and Rebbe Osher the Second of Stolin-Karlin .
When they died , their surviving sons were aged two and three , the sons from their first marriage having predeceased him . Some of the chassidim waited for the sons to grow up ; one eventually became the Piasetzner Rov . Other chassidim chose a grandson , Rabbi Yisroel Shapira as their next leader . A third group , including many learned rabbis , followed the scholarly Ostrovtser Rov . This led to the common epithet that when the Imrei Elimelech died , their main successors were the Rebbe fun der Daies ( Rebbe of the opinions , the Ostrovtzer , ) the Rebbe fun der Maiyes ( Rebbe of the hundreds , a polite way of saying the wealthy Chassidim ; their grandson , Rabbi Yisroel Shapira , ) and the Rebbe fun der peiyes ( Rebbe of the sidecurls , that is to say , the most intensely religious chassidim . ) Their youngest son , Yeshaya Shapira , became a rabbi but did not establish their own court , instead focusing on religious Zionism as an early leader in Hapoel HaMizrachi .
Writings
The teachings of the Grodzhikser Rebbe are collected in Imrei Elimelech and Divrei Elimelech .

St. Patrick Catholic Church is a parish of the Catholic Church in Meridian , Mississippi , in the Diocese of Jackson . Its historic church , located at 2614 Davis Street , was designed by Alfred Zucker . Since 1995 , St. Patrick 's , the historically African-American parish of St. Joseph , and St. Joseph of Cupertino at Naval Air Station Meridian have operated as the Catholic Community of Meridian , sharing pastoral and administrative staff .
Catholic missionaries from Paulding County arrived in 1853 , and the community build its first church on the site in 1866 , with 12 families on the roll . Its first resident parish priest , Fr . Louis Vally , arrived in 1868 . Under their leadership the parish grew considerably , starting its parochial school in 1873 and acquiring land for its convent in 1877 . It was also during Vally 's tenure that the current Gothic Revival was built , in 1886 .
Church
The church was designed by Alfred J.R.E . Zucker , a German-American architect then based in Vicksburg . The church is a modified cruciform structure of brick . At its entrance is a four-story square tower with a round arch balustrade . Its lancet stained glass windows are set in compound pointed arches in slightly recessed bays . It added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1979 .
School
St. Patrick School was established in 1873 , and housed in a dedicated facility adjacent to the church . It was staffed by the Sisters of Mercy for much of its history . In 1924 , its separate boys ' and girls ' schools were merged into a single coeducational K–12 school . It is today a preK–6 institution .

The Peel P50 is a three-wheeled microcar originally made from 1962 to 1965 by the Peel Engineering Company on the Isle of Man , and then from 2011 to present . It was listed in the 2010 Guinness World Records as the smallest production car ever made . The original model has no reverse gear , but a handle at the rear allows the very lightweight car to be maneuvered physically when required .
Designed as a city car , it was advertised in the 1960s as capable of seating `` one adult and a shopping bag . '' The vehicle 's only door was on its left side and equipment included a single windscreen wiper and one headlight . Standard colours were Daytona White , Dragon Red , and Dark Blue . The 1963 model retailed for £199 when new ( about £6,600 in 2019 , or US $ 8,500 ) . The company produced 50 P50s , of which 27 are known to still exist , one of which was sold for a record US $ 176,000 at a Sotheby 's auction in March 2016 .
In 2010 Peel Engineering Ltd. in England reinstated manufacturing of the P50 and Trident models from its premises in Sutton-in-Ashfield , England . Externally this car is very similar to the original , with the same dimensions and kerb weight as the original , but with mechanical differences in the suspension , steering , and drive-train , and a fully functioning reverse gear , ensuring they are road-legal under today 's rules . Production included petrol models with a 49 cc four-stroke engine and electric models with an electric moped motor and gelled-electrolyte batteries . The top speed of both cars is about .
Statistics
At long and wide and with an unladen weight of , the P50 holds the record as the smallest car ever to go into production . The Peel P50 's diminutive size and width means that it can quite easily fit through doorways and enter buildings , as demonstrated by Jeremy Clarkson during a sequence on a 2007 episode of Top Gear , where a blue P50 was driven through the BBC 's Television Centre .
1962–1966
The original P50 used a DKW single-cylinder engine , which gave it a top speed of approximately , and was equipped with a three-speed manual transmission that had no reverse gear . Consequently , turning in a confined area could be achieved only by pushing , or lifting the car using the handle on the rear and physically pulling it round . The makers and users claim fuel consumption of .
In 1963 , as a publicity stunt , a Peel P50 was taken to the top of Blackpool Tower in the lift and driven around the observation balcony .
At least one prototype , the Peel P55 Saloon Scooter , has also survived . Unlike the production Peel P50 ( along with all developments and replicas thereof ) , this prototype used the less stable layout of a single wheel at the front and two at the back .
Approximately 47 Peel P50s were sold at £299 each .
On 15 February 2013 at the Bruce Weiner RM Auction a genuine 1964 Peel P50 ( Registration number ARX 37B ) achieved in excess of ( ) .
Since 2011
In 2011 business people Gary Hillman and Faizal Khan went to the Dragons ' Den asking for £80,000 . They got the investment and started a new company to put their revised models into production . Three replica models were available initially : Gas , Eco and Fun . The line was later reduced to two : the Petrol and Electric models . These are hand-built to order in Sutton-in-Ashfield by Micro Car Specialists for the domestic and export markets .
In 2018 it was reported that Peel Engineering sells around fifteen P50s annually , plus ten or so continuations of its bigger sister , the two-seat bubblecar Peel Trident . The conventional piston engined P50 is more requested in the UK , priced at £14,879 – whereas greater demand for the Peel comes from the US , where the electric model ( at £13,679 ) helps owners to comply with emissions regulations .
Legal status
The original Peel P50 has always been road-legal in the UK , though the many replica versions are classed as Kitcars and as such , require MSVA inspection for 3 wheels Moped or 4 wheel Quadricycle . It is street-legal in the US . Cars were exported to other countries , sometimes being classified as a moped ( e.g . the P50 that went to Finland ) .
In the Netherlands there are two original Tridents registered as tricycles , but the Trident replica with the 50cc engine and top speed was registered as a moped . In Amsterdam the Ripley 's Believe It Or Not museum has one . Due to local traffic rules it may not be driven on the cycle path . In Wassenaar the Louwman Museum had an original P50 on display ; it was on the poster of the `` Dwarfcar '' themed exhibition .

The Tiverton riots refers to riots which broke out in Tiverton , Devon in May 1738 and again in 1749 .
1738 riot
Labourers employed in woollen manufacture rioted in May 1738 , in protest at a publican 's undercutting of prices for serge . The publican , Grimes , bought serges which had been returned from the merchants to the serge makers , and resold them to the same merchants at a lower price . This practice , which the merchants encouraged in order to increase their profit , was thought to be very unfair towards the manufacturers .
The labourers assembled in Tiverton , and were joined by those of Uffculme , Bampton , Silverton , Collumpton , Bradninch and Culmstock . They attacked Grimes ' house , the Red Lion Inn in Gold Street and broke into it . Having found a great number of serges , they threw them out and dragged them through the streets , hanged some upon their sign post and tore others in pieces . Grimes was found in the oven of a bake house , at the bottom of Poundhill , a few doors below their house . The rioters sat them astride a staff borne on their shoulders . They carried them through the streets and at last set them down before the house of the Mayor , Robert Dunsford , in St. Peter 's Street . The mayor had them taken away . A great number of constables were sworn in to resist the rioters , many of whom were taken and put into prison for a few hours only . This much enraged the rest and occasioned a great battle between them and the constables , before whom the rioters retreated to the top of Exeter Hill , a short distance from the town . Another skirmish took place there , when one man was killed and many were wounded , which put an end to the riot .
1749 riot
In the 1740s , difficulties with the wool trade led to another outbreak of rioting in 1749 . Workmen assembled to attack the house of Thomas Beedle , who was accused of acting as Grimes had done . They met in the Castle yard , drank a hogshead of cider and proceeded to Beedle 's house , at the end of Waterlane . The rioters remained in and about the house for five hours , smashing their goods , dragging their chains of wool and worsted about the streets , and letting their beer run about the house more than ankle deep . They emptied their house entirely , and would have burnt it , but for the presence of their child lying in a cradle . Failing to find Beedle ( who lay concealed at the Crown and Comb Inn , on the opposite side of the street ) the rioters seized Moses Quick , one of their woolcombers . Quick was set astride a staff and carried around the town . They were dragged through several pools and the mill leat . The rioters endeavoured to break their thumbs to disable them from combing , and at length conveyed them to their club house ; having there revived them with liquor , they sent them home nearly dead , and then retired to their respective habitations .

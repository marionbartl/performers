The Vice-President Saulos Chilima on Monday followed the footsteps of President Peter Mutharika in rebuffing a request from civil society organisations ( CSOs ) during the planned April 27 demonstrations to personally receive a petition .
The CSOs confirmed receiving the letter from the Veep 's office , but are yet to make a decision on their next course of action .
In a letter to the CSOs dated April 21 2018 , secretary to the Vice-President 's Office Clement Chinthu Phiri said the Office of President and Cabinet ( OPC ) would designate someone to receive the petition .
Reads the letter in part : “ In the letter you asked for the Rt . Honourable Dr. Saulos Klaus Chilima , Vice-President of the Republic of Malawi , to receive a petition on issue pertaining to the state of governance in Malawi , you indicated that you intend to present the petition on Friday 27th April 2018 .
“ I would like to inform you that the Right Honourable Vice President has referred your request to the Office of the President and Cabinet to determine and designate a government official to receive the petition on behalf of the Malawi Government . You may , therefore , pursue the matter through the Chief Secretary to the Government . ”
Mtambo confirmed receiving the response , but said they were yet to make a decision and to respond to the VP 's office .
“ We have received the response , and we will officially respond to them on Tuesday [ today ] , ” they said .
The CSOs have called for protests against the MK4 billion budget allocation to legislators and other social issues such as state of governance and persistent electricity blackouts .
The CSOs are demanding cancellation of disbursement of the K4 billion and the resignation of Finance Minister Goodall Gondwe and Kondwani Nankhumwa ( Minister for Local Government and Rural Development ) over their roles in the scam .
Led by Centre for Human Rights and Rehabilitation ( CHRR ) executive director Timothy Mtambo , the CSOs wrote Chilima on April 18 2018 asking them to personally receive the petition because Mutharika , who had earlier rebuffed them , would be out of the country .
On April 4 2018 , Mutharika , through State House Press Secretary Mgeme Kalilani said it was “ wishful thinking ” for the CSOs to expect the President to personally receive their petition because they were not party to the demonstrations .
Mutharika will still be in the United Kingdom ( UK ) where they went to attend the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting ( Chogm ) and pay a State visit to Scotland .
In an earlier interview with the Nation Newspaper after Mutharika snubbed them , Mtambo said they have previously delivered many petitions through other channels to Mutharika , but they have not seen any change ; hence , the decision to deliver the petition direct to the President .
They insisted that there was nothing wrong with the CSOs and the citizens demanding that Mutharika should receive the petition .
Said Mtambo : “ The Malawi Constitution is clear on this . It is now time that we should stop treating a President as God . They are our servant . Many times they have refused to face Parliament to respond to some questions and if they refuse to receive our petition , then we will really know what kind of leader we have .
“ Leaders should never run away from their people . If they [ Mutharika ] is a democrat , we will see them on the 27th . We have alerted the district councils as required by law and we expect that as government authorities , they will pass the information to the State House . ”
Meanwhile , University of Livingstonia ( Unilia ) political analyst George Phiri has said it was not politically right for Chilima to receive the petition after Mutharika had already snubbed the CSOs .
“ Chilima answers to Mutharika , and if the President said they would not receive the petition , it is not politically and morally right for Chilima to go on their own to receive the petition . It would have been different if Mutharika had delegated Chilima to receive it , ” they said .
In Blantyre , CSOs will protest from the Upper Stadium via Chipembere Highway to the civic offices , while in Mzuzu , they expect to march from Katoto via Mzuzu Clock Tower via High Court Round-about to civic offices .
In Lilongwe , where they expected the Presidency to receive their petition , the CSOs plan to march from Chisomo Private Secondary School in Mchesi , via Kamuzu Central Hospital ( KCH ) Roundabout , through Lingadzi Roundabout via Parliament Building to Capital Hill .
In an earlier statement , the CSOs said their decision to stage protests follows inconsistencies , illegality and suspicions that characterised the K4 billion payouts that raised governance and accountability questions .
The demonstrations , which the Public Affairs Committee ( PAC ) and opposition political parties are supporting , will be held under the theme For How Long Shall Malawians Continue To Be Taken for Granted ? Loss of Public Trust in the Current Administration : Time to Reclaim Our Destiny .
The CSOs argue that the K4 billion allocation is illegal and not in the best interest of Malawians ; hence , the need to immediately cancel
Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin took military aircraft on at least seven occasions without adequate justification , their department 's inspector general said in a report .
The inspector general said that Mnuchin 's use of the planes was not illegal but that they had failed to meet rules that require that military flights be used only if the White House determines in advance that doing so is justified by costs or specific security or emergency needs .
Mnuchin has been criticized for requesting a military aircraft for a trip to Kentucky during which they viewed the solar eclipse and a trip to Europe for their honeymoon in August . They withdrew the request for the honeymoon trip , according to the report from the counsel to the Treasury inspector general , Rich Delmar .
In total , Mnuchin requested government aircraft for nine trips , one of which was withdrawn and one that is scheduled for later this month . The report , released Thursday , found that each trip was classified as a White House support mission .
In order to get that classification , the president must have directed the official to take the trip and the department must show that commercial airlines were either not available or cost effective or that there was an emergency need or national security concern requiring military planes . Those guidelines are based on a 2011 memo from then-White House Chief of Staff William Daley .
Delmar found that for the majority of the trips Mnuchin requested , it was “ not explicit ” that President Trump had ordered the travel , and the department did not provide a detailed analysis of the trip . Most of the requests included a similar line saying the planes were needed “ due to scheduling , logistics and secure communications needs . ”
This “ single boilerplate statement constituted the whole analysis and justification for designation and use of military aircraft , ” Delmar wrote .
The inspector general 's review found “ no violation of law in these requests and uses . ”
“ What is of concern is a disconnect between the standard of proof called for in the Daley memo and the actual amount of proof provided by Treasury and accepted by the White House in justifying these trip requests , ” Delmar wrote .
The Office of Management and Budget said in a memo last week it was reviewing guidance for the use of government aircraft and suggested that officials should be using government air travel only in exceptional situations .
The report comes amid reports that three other administration officials have used private or military aircraft for trips , including former Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price , who reportedly spent more than $ 400,000 on private domestic travel . Price resigned last week after Trump expressed anger at their use of private charter flights .

LAHORE - The Lahore High Court Tuesday directed the Punjab government to submit reply in a petition challenging removal of Noorul Ameen Mengal as director general of Punjab Food Authority .
Justice Shahid Jamil Khan passed the order on petition filed by two citizens , allowing the officer to continue with the post of PFA DG if they had not relinquished the charge . Justice Khan directed the Punjab chief secretary to submit detailed reply . The court adjourned hearing till July 05 .
Advocate Saad Rasool appeared on behalf of the petitioners , arguing that the government was empowered to appoint director general at the PFA under section 10 of the Punjab Food Authority Act 2011 . The counsel questioned the powers of the government to remove the DG of the authority . They argued that the provincial government had no power to remove director of the authority . The board of members of the authority , however , they said could remove/change authority 's director general , they contended .
The counsel said no decision had been taken by the board members of the authority regarding removal of the DG .
The interim government removed them from the office by exercising beyond its jurisdiction as it was mandate was just to ensure free and fair election , the counsel submitted . The bench questioned the maintainability of the petition on which the counsel said that it was for the sake of public interest and was not the only matter of public servant 's removal , therefore , they were not required to approach the relevant services tribunal .
Hearing of Abbasi , Fawad Ch 's petition put off
The LHC adjourned for Wednesday ( today ) hearing on petition moved by former PM Shahid Khaqan Abbasi challenging rejection of their nomination papers to contest election from their home constituency , NA-57 , Murree , and their disqualification for life . A two-member bench headed by Justice Sayyed Mazahar Ali Akbar Naqvi was hearing the case . The federal government failed to submit reply due to which the bench adjourned the hearing till today . The same bench also adjourned hearing of the petition filed by Fawad Chaudhary till today .
Previously , the LHC allowed Shahid Khaqan Abbasi and Fawad Chaudahry by suspending decisions of respective appellate tribunals regarding rejection of their nomination papers and their disqualification under Article 62 ( 1 ) ( f ) of the Constitution .

If you 're like me , the mention of the word chemistry can send you into a panic–admittedly not my favorite subject . But I love ceramics , so I realized a while back that I had to face my fears and try to get a grasp on ceramic chemistry .
Yes , a general knowledge of ceramic chemistry and glaze materials can be very helpful when mixing glazes and interpreting firing results . In this post , an excerpt from Science for Potters , Linda Bloomfield breaks down what potters need to know on the Periodic Table of the Elements . We also included a couple of great Cone 6 glaze recipes so you could put some of this new knowledge into practice . Get your thinking caps on ! We 're going back to school ! – Jennifer Poellot Harnetty , editor .
P.S . For more detailed information about elements from the periodic table that are relevant for ceramic artists , atom structure , and electrons and orbitals , check out Science for Potters by Linda Bloomfield in the CAN shop .
Ceramic Chemistry – The Elements
The elements were forged in nuclear furnaces inside stars . Ordinary stars like the sun burn hydrogen , two hydrogen atoms colliding together to make a helium atom and releasing energy in the form of heat and light . In dying stars , the hydrogen runs out and the helium atoms fuse together to make the heavier elements . Elements heavier than iron , such as lead and uranium , are only formed when a massive star explodes to become a supernova . The dust left from such an explosion eventually re-forms to make new stars and planets like our Earth . We are all literally made of stardust .
In the ancient world , the elements , or basic constituents of matter , were believed to be earth , air , fire , and water . We now know that there are in fact more than 90 naturally occurring elements , including metals , semi-metals , and non-metals . At ambient temperature , some elements exist as gases , a few as liquids , and many as solids , but their state of matter can change with temperature . As potters we are most interested in the elements in the Earth 's crust that form rocks , as these are also the elements present in clay and glazes . The most abundant are oxygen , silicon , and aluminum , followed by iron , calcium , sodium , potassium , and magnesium ( 1 ) .
Ceramic Chemistry – The Potter 's Periodic Table
The periodic table explains the chemical and physical properties of the different materials used by potters ( 4 ) . It is the basis for understanding the whole of chemistry . However , we are primarily interested in the elements useful to potters , which include silicon , aluminum , the alkali metals and alkaline earth metals , as well as the transition metals .
During the nineteenth century , scientists began to notice that groups of elements had similar properties . Not all the elements had yet been discovered , but when they were lined up in order of increasing atomic number in seven rows , similarities between groups became clear . We know now that is because the elements in a group all have the same number of electrons in their outer shell , so they all react in similar ways .
In the periodic table , the elements are listed in order of ascending atomic number . There are seven rows of elements and eighteen columns . The elements in each column , called a group , have similar properties . Important groups for the potter are group 1 , the alkali metals ( sodium , potassium etc . ) , and group 2 , the alkaline earth metals ( calcium , magnesium etc. ) . These are used as fluxes in glazes . All the elements on the left-hand side and middle of the periodic table are metals . The ones at the bottom are known as heavy metals as they have more protons and neutrons and therefore greater atomic weights . Many of the metals discovered since the early nineteenth century have names ending in ‘ -ium ' , for example , sodium , calcium , barium . Their oxides form alkaline solutions when dissolved in water . The oxides , rather than the metals , are of most interest to the potter as they are the constituents of clay and glazes .
Gain a better understanding of glazes ! John Britt 's video Understanding Glazes demystifies the complex topic of glaze chemistry . Starting with glaze testing—because testing is key to understanding ceramic processes—John explains various testing methods that will help you get great results quickly .

The central block of the periodic table contains the transition metals . These can have several oxidation states and are important in producing colored glazes , particularly the metals along the top row : chromium , manganese , iron , cobalt , nickel , and copper . The two rows inserted at the bottom are known as the lanthanides and the actinides , and some can also produce colors in glass and glazes . Uranium is the heaviest naturally occurring element and can produce yellow in glazes , although it is no longer used owing to its radioactivity . The elements beyond uranium can only be synthesized in nuclear reactors and decay radioactively into other elements . Lead is the heaviest stable , non-radioactive element .
On the right-hand side of the periodic table is a diagonal line , which divides metals from non-metals . The elements on this line include boron , silicon , and arsenic . They are known as metalloids and are semiconductors , which means they will only conduct electricity under certain conditions . Silicon is the basis of modern electronics and computers . Some of the elements most useful to potters also lie on or near this dividing line and include silicon and boron , which are both glass formers although the latter is mainly used as a flux in low-temperature glazes and in heat-resistant borosilicate glass . Aluminum is next to silicon , found in clay and used as a stabilizer in glazes , preventing them from becoming too runny when fired . On the right-hand side of silicon is phosphorus , used as a flux in glazes and in bone china . Antimony and selenium are used in small amounts as yellow and red colorants in glazes .
The top right-hand corner of the periodic table contains oxygen , the halogens fluorine and chlorine , and the noble gases helium and neon . Oxygen is present in all clay and glazes , usually combined with silicon and aluminum as oxides . Fluorine is of interest to the potter , as it is often given off in the kiln from decomposing fluorspar , a mineral found in Cornwall Stone .
The far left of the periodic table is highly alkaline and the right is highly acidic . The strength of the alkali decreases from left to right , while the strength of the acid increases . For example , along the third row , sodium oxide ( Na2O ) is highly alkaline , magnesium oxide ( MgO ) is alkaline , aluminum oxide ( Al2O3 ) is amphoteric , silicon dioxide ( SiO2 ) is acidic , and phosphorus pentoxide ( P2O5 ) is highly acidic . In ceramic glazes and vitreous ceramic clay bodies , the alkaline and acidic oxides react together and melt . The alkaline metal oxides are fluxes , which react with the acidic glass former , silica . The elements in the central block are amphoteric ( able to react as an acid or base/alkaline ) , although many show slightly alkaline or acidic properties . Their oxides are used in glazes as supplementary fluxes , stabilizers , opacifiers , and colorants .

A jury has ruled in favor of Taylor Swift , awarding the pop star a whopping $ 1 in their sexual assault case against former radio DJ David Mueller .
The Grammy-winning entertainer sought the symbolic amount in their federal counter-lawsuit against Mueller as a chance to stand up for other women . They took the stand last week to testify that Mueller stayed attached to their bare backside during a photo op with them and their then-girlfriend Shannon Melcher , who also testified in the case .
`` That single dollar is of immeasurable value in the scheme of things , '' Swift 's lawyer Douglas Baldridge said in closing arguments on Monday ( via the Denver Post ) . `` It says no means no for all women . ''
After they and Mueller 's lawyer , Gabriel McFarland , delivered their closing arguments and after nearly four hours of deliberation , the jury -- of six women and two men -- decided that Mueller assaulted the then-23-year-old singer by groping them at a 2013 pre-concert meet-and-greet at Denver 's Pepsi Center .
`` I want to thank Judge William J. Martinez and the jury for their careful consideration , my attorneys Doug Baldridge , Danielle Foley , Jay Schaudies and Katie Wright for fighting for me and anyone who feels silenced by a sexual assault , and especially anyone who offered their support throughout this four-year ordeal and two-year long trial process , ” Swift said in a statement reported by TV station Denver7 .

LAURENS , S.C. ( AP )  Arguments about a lawsuit that seeks belated integration for a World War I memorial that separates the soldiers ' names by race have been delayed
Lawyers for the state of South Carolina planned to argue Tuesday that the lawsuit should be thrown out . But that hearing was postponed until March .
On the other side of the lawsuit is a Greenwood group that wanted to change plaques on the World War I monument that list the dead under separate `` colored '' and `` white '' sections . They were stopped by the Heritage Act .
The act requires a two-thirds vote from the state Legislature to change any historical monument from any era of history . It was passed in 2000 when lawmakers feared a backlash against monuments and street names honoring Confederates .

Prime Minister Narendra Modi 's book Exam Warriors may perhaps win them more votes than their election budget that shied away from disbursing sops .
To be released on Saturday by Penguin Random House India , the author 's bio on the book is five paragraphs long . The very first paragraph reads , “ His victory was propelled by historic support from India 's youth , particularly first-time voters . ”
That is factually correct . A data analysis by political scientist Oliver Heath in 2015 found that the BJP 's unprecedented victory in 2014 was propelled less by the votes it snatched away from other parties and more by new , first-time voters .
There were 41.7 crore registered voters in the 2009 general elections . This rose to 55.3 crore in 2014 . The 32 percent increase amounts to 13.6 crore voters . That 's more than the total number of votes the Congress won in 2014 ( which was 10.6 crores ) . Heath 's detailed constituency-level analysis found the BJP won constituencies that it earlier did not by mobilising new voters .
The number of voters aged 18 or 19 alone was 2.31 crore . Besides , even those who were 22 in 2014 would not have been able to vote in 2009 since they were only 17 .
Why first-time voters matter
First time voters are a very important group for any party for various reasons .
Many older voters tend to develop long-term party loyalties . These are the people who will tell you before an election that they vote for the party symbol , without worrying about whether their party will win or not , whether they like the candidate or not , whether the party performed well in power or not . It is difficult for another party to change such long-term loyalties . This is how the Bahujan Samaj Party holds on to a 15-20 percent vote-share even when it hardly wins any seats .
It is , therefore , a smarter idea to persuade new voters – such as the children of those with hardened loyalties . Young , teenage voters are likely to be open to voting differently from their parents . This has been evident in the youth support Narendra Modi received in 2014 .
Secondly , after securing a voter 's first vote , if a party can get their vote again , chances are that such a voter could become a life-long loyal supporter of the party .
Chacha Modi
Modi has been worrying about exam stress in their Mann Ki Baat radio address for three exam cycles now . If a 14-year-old in 2015 was touched by Modi 's concern for their exam stress , such a student would be 18 years old in 2019 .
From the very start of their prime ministership , Modi has consistently tried to become Chacha Modi , a la Nehru , doing photo-ops for children and expressing concern for them . They are seen pulling their ears or appreciating some child 's achievement in Mann Ki Baat .
Here they are , interacting with school children in Muslim-majority Lakshwadeep in December 2017 . Here they are , answering their questions on Teacher 's Day . Even on a trip to Japan , they took time off to talk to Indian schoolchildren .
But the centerpiece of their outreach to future voters has been exam stress . There is no better way to connect to a group of voters than to show concern in their most difficult hour . This is now culminating in a book .
As the 2019 general elections come closer , we are likely to see the Modi government reach out more and more to first time voters through innovative events .
The prime minister has already asked for a mock parliament to be organised in every district of the country on 15 August . Through this , they want children to contribute ideas for “ New India ” . This would help impress upon first time voters that Narendra Modi not only wants to deliver change , but is giving them a chance to have their voice in it .
Mobilising millennials
Soon after winning the Gujarat elections with a narrowing margin , Prime Minister Modi set their sights on millennial voters .
Wishing the nation a happy new year , the prime minister counted how those born in the year 2000 would turn 18 this year , making 2018 a special year .
Appealing to their emotions through a book on exam stress and a mock parliament is one thing . But Modi has their eyes set at actually getting them to sign up on the electoral rolls .
“ Indian democracy welcomes the voters of the 21st century , the new India voters , ” they had said in their Mann Ki Baat address on 31 December 2017 . “ I congratulate our youth and urge them to register themselves as voters . The entire nation is eager to welcome you as voters of the 21st century…your vote will prove to be the bedrock of new India , ” they said .
At a dinner meet for BJP leaders last month , the prime minister said the party 's prime focus for 2019 had to be 18 to 25-year-olds . To mobilise first time voters , it plans to launch a ‘ Millenium Vote Campaign ' with an app that would help first time voters register to vote . The advantage of an app like this is that it would help the BJP collect data and have access to those who sign up . This could in turn be used for campaign outreach .
Replacing old voters with new
Estimates of first-time voters in 2019 range from 1.3 crore to 2 crore . If it 's the latter , it could mean an average of around 37,000 new votes in every constituency .
That is a large number of votes to determine outcomes .
The BJP won a clear majority in 2014 with just over 31 percent vote share ( not counting pre-poll allies ) . In other words , the BJP does not need to keep everybody happy to win . Just winning a third of votes can bring it to power thanks to the first-past-the-post system .
As the BJP faces anti-incumbency on account of farmers ' unrest and its inability to generate enough formal employment , some of those 31 percent could go to other parties , mainly the Congress .
The party could replace those losses with first-time voters . It may not be giving big farm loan waivers , but those angry farmers could be replaced by urban youth who are convinced Modi cares for them since they worry about the most important thing in their lives , exam stress , and wants their suggestions for new India once the exams are over and they are in college .
HONG KONG ( Reuters ) - Foxconn , one of Apple 's main suppliers , formally known as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd said on Friday it aims to invest T $ 10 billion ( $ 342 million ) in artificial intelligence ( AI ) and related spheres of industrial internet .
“ Our investment for R & D and technology investment absolutely wo n't be weak . We hope in the next few years to invest T $ 10 billion in the AI application and related spheres of the industrial internet , ” executive Vice President Fang-ming Lu said at a press conference .
“ We have an AI team but it 's still not enough . We need more and more talent , ” Lu added .
On Thursday , Hon Hai 's unit Foxconn Industrial Internet submitted its listing application to Shanghai stock exchange .
One of the integral themes of an autonomous driving future is communication . Vehicles will be required to rapidly and constantly talk to one another , relaying position , speed , and intent , with the same demands applying to our roadways and intersections which will be expected to relay weather , traffic , and safety information in real time as vehicles approach .
Pedestrians , however , pose a unique problem . In busy cities , pedestrians and drivers routinely communicate non-verbally by making eye contact or gesticulating , but an autonomous vehicle does n't have that privilege . Its machine code is dependant on a series of binary questions it must ask itself in order to determine if the person is a threat , which , if affirmative , currently results in the car coming to a halt , which on occasion has caused a rear-end collision , or two .
Indian shuttlers Kidambi Srikanth and HS Prannoy moved into the second round while B. Sai Praneeth bowed out of the Indonesia Open Superseries Premier badminton tournament on Wednesday .
In a gruelling 56-minute battle , Srikanth edged past Wong Wing Ki Vincent of Hong Kong 21-15 , 17-21 , 21-16 , while in a contrasting match , Prannoy outplayed their Indonesian opponent Anthony Sinisuka Ginting 21-13 , 21-18 . It was the end of the road for Sai Praneeth as they lost to second seed Son Wan-ho of South Korea in straight games 21-14 , 21-18 .
In a marathon match , Srikanth started on a positive note , winning the first game . But soon the Guntur player lost their momentum and lost the second game . In the decider , Srikanth played to their strength and displayed some brilliant shots to prevail over their opponent .
In the other match , it was a cake walk for Prannoy as their opponent Ginting never looked in the contention . The Indian shuttler dominated throughout the match and ended up clinching the game .
In men 's ' doubles category , Satwiksairaj Rankireddy and Chirag Shetty were thrashed by Fajar Alfian and Muhammad Rian Ardianto of Indonesia 9-21 , 19-21 and crashed out of the prestigious tournament .
Womens ' doubles a pair of Ashwini Ponnappa and N. Sikki Reddy also showed a dismal performance and bowed out of the meet . The Indian pair were beaten by Dian Fitriani and Nadya Melati of Indonesia 21-19 , 19-21 , 13-21 in a match which lasted more than one hour .
On Thursday afternoon , the Indians left in the fray in the singles events will present their credentials for claiming quarter-final berths . Prannoy will clash with top-ranked Lee Chong Wei , while Srikanth takes on Jorgensen . Saina Nehwal will cross swords with Thailand 's Nitchaon Jindapol , while PV Sindhu will play an evening match against Chinese-American Zhang Beiwen . The Indian doubles teams will no doubt watch from the sidelines , and cheer on their compatriots in the arena .
New Delhi : With Opposition parties mocking the one paisa cut in the prices of petroleum products , Petroleum Minister Dharmendra Pradhan on Wednesday said the prices are decided by the oil companies and the government has no role in it .
`` Petrol prices were connected to the market a few years back and daily pricing was brought in a year back . The government does not fix the price .
`` The government used to monitor the price when it used to give out subsidy but today the oil companies are free to decide their price as per the international market . The government has no role in monitoring the price apart from the policy framework , '' they said .
Earlier in the day , Indian Oil Corporation ( IOC ) reduced the prices of petrol and diesel by one paisa after accidentally showing a fall of 50-60 paisa per litre due to a `` technical glitch '' . The minor reduction came after a daily hike for the last 16 days totalling to Rs 4 per litre .
The Congress slammed the government for `` playing a cruel joke '' on the people .
`` Dear Prime Minister , you have cut the price of petrol and diesel today by 1 paisa . One paisa ! ? ? If this is your idea of a prank , it is childish and in poor taste . PS : A One paisa cut is not a suitable response to the # FuelChallenge I threw you last week , '' tweeted Congress chief Rahul Gandhi .
However , Pradhan said oil is an international commodity and its prices are determined by several factors like quantum of oil production , international market and politics , oil companies and the taxes levied by the Centre and states .
`` I have said this ( oil ) is an international commodity . The price has increased because of a fight between Iran and America , America 's sanction on Iran and Venezuela crisis . We need to keep in mind international diplomatic challenges when we think about energy security , '' they said .
Noting both Central and state governments have responsibilities for welfare , they said : `` Of the entire money that the Central government collects , 42 per cent is given to the states as per 14th Finance Commission . Of the balance , 60 to 70 per cent goes back through Centrally sponsored schemes . Development of the states is a priority issue . ''
On Kerala declaring a price cut of Re 1 per litre of petrol and diesel from Friday forgoing the amount from its tax portion , Pradhan said the state is one of the largest tax collectors .
Other states should try to reduce fuel prices but each state has their limitations and priorities , they said .
`` That 's part of the business , '' Bradley said after scoring eight points . `` I do n't worry about it . I went from Boston to Detroit and now I 'm here . This is my focus here . I try to control what I can control . All I can control is going out there and playing hard and trying to get wins for the Clippers . ''

The enrolment of out of school children in our country is a dream come true . Children in the country not only face problems , like poverty , sanitary system but a quality education as well .
According to reports revealed by the Elementary and Secondary Education Department that more than 1.8 million children are out of school in Khyber Paktunkhwa province with that the out-of-school children in the province were 23per cent of the total population of the children 5-17 years .
64pc are girls and 36pc boys . Out of the total children , at least 1.152 million ( 64pc ) are reported as ‘ never enrolled ' and 0.648 million ( 36pc ) as ‘ previously enrolled ' or dropped out . The report also added that , 34pc boys across the province have never gone to school or dropped out because of disinterest , poverty , absence of schools and many religious and social norms .
Of the total enrolled children , 61.52pc are getting education in the government schools , 31.86pc in private schools and around 3pc children in seminaries .
Districts like Abbottabad has the highest enrollement rate in the province followed by Haripur district while the least unenrollment has taken place.whilst the next place in the enrollment list is shared by districts of Malakand and Chitral .
The out of school children should be enrolled in the school since the government of PTI with the tall claim to educate the other province has failed to educate the youths of KPK . This shows how corrupt our politicians are and eating the systems of our society .

Sweet little Destiny may only be three years old , but she 's proud of their home – a home that love built .
John Derringer , the morning show host of Q107 , and Ellen Campbell , founder of Abuse Hurts , teamed up 14 years ago through Derringer 's 13 Days of Christmas to help build lives , and now homes .
“ This is the first time we 've done an individual house and it normally is n't something we would do , but it just presented itself , ” said Campbell .
Abuse Hurts is a charity committed to accessible support , healing and empowerment of anyone touched by the trauma of abuse through programs like Delivering Hope and more recently DreamBuilds . The charity stepped up when Jennifer Brown , a sexual abuse survivor , needed a stable home to raise their daughter Destiny .
“ I had no walls . I had no kitchen . I had no bathroom . I had a toilet sticking out of the floor – I had basically nothing , ” said Brown .
“ Jennifer grew up in this house . They do n't have a lot of good memorie , s but I told them that this can become their home and the memories can go , ” said Campbell .
“ We spent three months working on this with volunteers and tradespeople and transformed it from really just a shell into a beautiful home . ”
“ They take the resources that they receive from the incredible generosity of Toronto residents and are able to make that work over the rest of the year , ” said Derringer .
Derringer 's 13 Days of Christmas is now in its 14th year and has raised more than $ 10.5 million in product and cash for Abuse Hurts in order to assist more than 100,000 individuals every year through more than 100 agencies .
“ This is such a labour of love , ” said Campbell . “ I was abused and it 's so wonderful to see that something so horrible that happened to me has turned into something so good . ”
“ Ellen has helped me more than I could ever put into words and they continue to help me , ” said Brown .
“ I ca n't even put into words how grateful I am . This house looks amazing and it 's mine . It 's mine and my daughter 's . ”

Trevor Powers dissolved their Youth Lagoon project back in 2016 , then returned earlier this month with a new single , the moody , dreamlike “ Playwright ” . Now , Powers has emerged with details regarding their solo debut , as well as two new songs .
The LP , titled Mulberry Violence , was recorded across six weeks in Tornillo , TX , at Sonic Ranch with Beyoncé collaborator Stuart White . Powers built the album from their own poetry , as well as a series of audio experiments that were inspired by the visual works of artists such as Francis Bacon , Sister Gertrude Morgan , and Harry Clarke .
In a press statement , Powers says of the album , “ Mulberry Violence…is where stillness meets pandemonium . Dead air meets babel . Harmony meets war . Sisters from the same womb , separated at birth . It served as a personal document of the everlasting battle inside of us . No one has it figured out ; least of all me. ” Read their full statement below .
You can hear Powers ' interest in texture and avant-pop experimentation in the new singles , which weave together hip-hop beats and R & B melodies with orchestral grandeur , as well as found sounds and jarring scraps of noise . Powers ' delicate , insectoid vocals float throughout it all , exuding the same kind of vulnerability that made Youth Lagoon so approachable . Listen to “ Ache ” and “ Plaster Saint ” below .
Mulberry Violence is due out August 17th via Powers ' own Baby Halo .

Democrats Push For Internal Documents On 2020 Census Citizenship Question
Enlarge this image toggle caption Win McNamee/Getty Images Win McNamee/Getty Images
Democratic lawmakers are calling for a subpoena to force the U.S. Census Bureau and Commerce Department to release internal documents about the decision to add a controversial citizenship question to forms for the upcoming national headcount .
The request comes two weeks before a congressional oversight hearing on the 2020 census .
`` We believe these documents are critical for our Committee , '' write all 18 Democrats on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee in a letter to its chairperson , Republican Rep. Trey Gowdy of South Carolina , `` to understand the concerns raised internally by career experts at the Census Bureau itself about the dangers of adding this untested new citizenship question to the census — as well as why the Trump Administration disregarded these concerns . ''
The U.S. Census Bureau is part of the Commerce Department .
A Commerce Department spokesperson has previously told NPR the documents will not be released until after the May 8 hearing . The agency is preparing to release them publicly after its attorneys file them later next month at the federal courts that are hearing the lawsuits against the citizenship question .
Sen. Kamala Harris of California and other Democrats on the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee , which has oversight of the U.S. Census Bureau , have previously made requests for these documents . NPR has filed Freedom of Information Act requests for them as well .
Gowdy 's communications director , Amanda Gonzalez told NPR Tuesday morning that they are `` not aware '' of the Democrats ' letter . `` I do n't believe the committee has received it yet , '' they said , referring to the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee .
Previously , Gonzalez has declined to comment on whether a subpoena would be issued for the documents to be released in time for the hearing .
The Democrats ' letter notes that regardless of the legal fight over the citizenship question , members of Congress have `` an independent responsibility under the Constitution to conduct oversight of the census . ''
Democratic lawmakers — including the House oversight committee 's top Democrat , Rep. Elijah Cummings of Maryland — have been raising concerns about the citizenship question since it was first announced by Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross in late March .
Ross approved a last-minute request to add a citizenship question from the Justice Department . The DOJ says the question is needed to get a better count of voting-age citizens in order to enforce the Voting Rights Act 's provisions against voting discrimination of racial and language minority groups . Since the civil rights law was enacted in 1965 , the DOJ has relied on estimates of U.S. citizens rather than official counts by the census . Those who have criticized the addition of the citizenship question say those estimates are adequate .
The data are used for reapportioning seats in Congress , drawing legislative districts and distributing an estimated $ 800 billion a year in federal funding .
Cummings and other Democrats have cited research by the Census Bureau suggesting that asking about citizenship could discourage immigrants and communities of color from participating in the census — a national headcount of every person living in the U.S. required by the Constitution every 10 years .
New Delhi : The BCCI has decided to reward the three national selectors with increased remuneration besides doubling the fees of umpires , scorers and video analysts .
The decision was taken by the Cricket Operations wing of BCCI headed by Saba Karim and the CoA also feels that chief selector MSK Prasad and company should be rewarded for their services .
Interestingly , BCCI treasurer Aniruddh Chaudhry is not aware about the remuneration hike .
As of now , chairperson gets Rs 80 lakh per annum while other selectors get Rs 60 lakh . The decision to increase the remuneration was taken as two ousted selectors Gagan Khoda and Jatin Paranjpe are drawing the same salary as Devang Gandhi and Sarandeep Singh .
`` Since selectors can be only appointed in AGMs , Jatin and Gagan despite not rendering services are drawing a fat salary as per norms . This is being unfair to Devang and Sarandeep , who are criscrossing the country , '' a senior BCCI official said .
It is expected that chairperson will get something in the range of Rs 1 crore while the two others will get anything between Rs 75 to 80 lakh .
The BCCI has also decided to double the match duty fees of domestic match referees , umpires , scorers and video analysts after a gap of six years .
The recommendation for a hike in fees was made by the Cricket Operations Division headed by Karim in consultation with the CoA during a meeting on 12 April .
However , treasurer Chaudhary has not been kept in loop regarding any of these financial decisions .
`` I can remember that Aniruddh had suggested a substantial hike during a finance committee meeting last year but I do n't think they have been kept in loop this time , '' a senior BCCI official told PTI on conditions of anonymity .
As per the revised pay structure , an umpire will now get Rs 40 , 000 per day for a first class , three day or 50 over game compared to the earlier Rs 20,000 .
For T20 matches , it will be Rs 20,000 per match from the earlier Rs 10,000 .
For the match referees , it will be Rs 30,000 for four day , three day and one day games while Rs 15,000 for T20 games .
The scorers , who have been the least paid , will now get Rs 10,000 per match day , save T20 games where they will be paid Rs 5000 .
The video analysts will now get Rs 15000 per day for non T20 games and Rs 7500 for the shortest format .
Meanwhile , Telengana Cricket Association has sought for associate membership from COA since Hyderabad has primary membership as a voter member .

East Lansing – Michigan State was one of the few top-10 teams to get out of last week unscathed .
So , too , was Villanova , which had a win over No . 12 Gonzaga last week , enough to offset a sluggish win over LaSalle and leapfrog Michigan State into the No . 1 ranking the nation .
Villanova ( 10-0 ) went from No . 4 to No . 1 in both the Associated Press poll and the coaches ' polls this week as Michigan State ( 9-1 ) went from No . 3 to No . 2 in both .
The Spartans defeated Rutgers and Southern Utah last week , not enough to stay ahead of the unbeaten Wildcats , but it was n't something Michigan State coach Tom Izzo was worrying about on Monday .
“ I do n't know . We have n't been 1 for a couple years so I do n't know what kind of distraction it would bring , ” Izzo said at their weekly press conference . “ There 's enough on this team already that I do n't think it would bring any more distractions , but it does n't totally surprise me . Villanova was playing well , though they struggled yesterday , too .

“ As I said , if we do n't win by 20 we 're struggling so we have to deal with that as it is and that 's great . As they say , it 's not where you are in December it 's where you are in April that matters and we 'll just keep working toward that goal for ourselves . ”
Michigan State has a bit of a break from games this week as players take final exams , but it will get challenged again on Saturday when they take on Oakland at 2:30 p.m. at Little Caesars Arena in Detroit .
The Spartans and Golden Grizzlies ( 6-4 ) have played 15 times with Michigan State winning every meeting . However , Oakland has come close , including in 2015 when it pushed No . 1-ranked MSU to the limit at The Palace before the Spartan prevailed in overtime .
Michigan State wo n't have the No . 1 ranking this time , but that hardly lessens how big it will be for coach Greg Kampe and the Grizzlies .
“ I 'm sure Greg is more disappointed than I am , because I 'm sure they would have loved for us to come in there as 1 , ” Izzo said . “ But if they beat the No . 1 team or the No . 2 team it 's gon na be damn good for their program so they should n't worry about that either . ”
Source : Hwange increases coal production by 1 000 % – The Zimbabwe Independent October 6 , 2017
HWANGE Colliery Company Ltd ( HCCL ) has increased production to 300 000 metric tonnes per month in the third quarter from 30 000 metric tonnes in first quarter on the back of government capitalisation and turnaround strategies , businessdigest has established .
Melody Chikono
HCCL Managing Director Engineer Thomas Makore said the 1 000 % increase in average tonne production was on the back of turnaround strategies that HCCL implemented together with government capitalisation .
“ Our production was on average 30 000 mt per month in the first quarter of 2017 , following the capitalisation , our production rose to 300 000 mt per month at the third quarter 2017 , ” Makore told businessdigest this week .
Overall coal output production jumped from a low of 30 000 mt per month in 2016 to 170 000 mt in May 2017 and 234 000 mt in June 2017 as turnaround strategies began to bear fruit .
Makore said other drivers of growth have been equipment repairs , maintenance , stabilisation and availability of working capital for production inputs as well as focused production .
Makore also pointed to their productivity improvement programme through the 100 days rapid results methodology and the resumption of production by their major mining contractor Mota Engil as other factors that contributed to the substantive increase in coal production . Hwange Colliery is also currently resuscitating its underground mining operations where high value coking coal is produced . Coking coal has demand in regional markets and is used to make coke which fetches a high price from ferro-chrome smelters , steel furnaces and foundries .
Makore said the firmness of coal and coke prices on the international markets will bolster the company 's turnaround implementation strategy .
“ Domestic demand is also firm from major customers such as the national power utility ( Zesa ) , industry and the tobacco sector , ” they said
Finance minister Patrick Chinamasa last week commended Hwange 's efforts saying the performance was exceptional and was a success story in line with government 's efforts to increase revenue in the mining sector .
Government is targeting US $ 3 billion in mining revenue this year .
Beijing : India on Thursday called for enhanced connectivity and unimpeded trade among SCO member states with due respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity besides deepening cooperation to fight terrorism and extremism .
Speaking at the flag raising ceremony of India and Pakistan at the headquarters of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation ( SCO ) , Indian ambassador to China Vijay Gokhale highlighted India 's sovereignty concerns without directly referring to $ 50 billion China-Pakistan Economic Corridor ( CPEC ) being laid through Pakistan-occupied Kashmir .
`` We support enhanced connectivity and unimpeded trade in the SCO region and believe that initiatives should be pursued in an inclusive and sustainable manner with due respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity of all members , '' they said .
They said India would also like to deepen practical cooperation in its fight against terrorism and extremism .
The envoy also offered India 's readiness to share its expertise in a host of areas including space and IT .
`` We are ready to share our expertise with fellow SCO members in areas like IT , Space , renewable energy , agriculture , banking and human resource development , '' they said .
`` With India 's joining , SCO now represents 20 percent of the world 's GDP , 22 percent of the area , 42 percent of the world 's population . Stability and progress of the SCO will be beneficial to the region and the world at large . India stands ready to contribute to further enhancing the stature and influence of the SCO , '' they said .
`` Together with other members , we are ready to harvest new opportunities to realise the full potential of our mutually beneficial cooperation , '' they said .
They offered India 's full support to China for successful and productive presidency of the SCO . China took over as the rotating presidency of the organisation from Kazakhstan .
Indian and Pakistani flags were formally raised at the SCO headquarters on Thursday .
Later , Gokhale along with Pakistan 's ambassador to China Masood Khalid , assistant foreign minister of China Kong Xuanyou and SCO secretary general Rashid Alimov beat a huge drum representing Shanghai spirit .
Terming the entry of Pakistan and India into the SCO as a historic day , Khalid said it is beginning of a new journey for Pakistan .
`` This is a moment of fulfilment , of accomplishment , and of success . It will remind us in future that it was on this day that we had pledged together to work for a shared vision of common development , '' they said .
Pakistan will work to uphold the Shanghai Spirit and the SCO Charter to promote peace and stability in the region , further harness the potential of SCO for regional security , connectivity and economic integration and develop people to people contacts and cultural interaction , they said .
`` Let us all pledge on this day that we will leave no stone unturned in the attainment of greater good of our people through cooperation and understanding as SCO family , '' they said .

Singer Ariana Grande is to become a character in the Final Fantasy : Brave Exvius mobile game .
The 23-year-old singer announced on Sunday they would be appearing in the game , which was first released in Japan in October 2015 .
In a post on Instagram they wrote , “ I 'm SO so excited to finally share that I 'll be featured in FINAL FANTASY BRAVE EXVIUS * crying * check out my character in the game , it 's the cutest thing i 've ( sic ) ever seen in my entire life and i 'm so excited and in love with it i ( sic ) can not contain myself . ”
Grande later shared a video , showing off their character 's look and abilities , with the avatar 's look apparently based on the latex bunny mask outfit they wore for the cover of their latest album Dangerous Woman and the video accompanying its title track .
The mobile game version of Grande seems to have magical abilities too , including casting spells .
Final Fantasy is one of the most beloved gaming series of all time , having delighted fans since 1987 .
The Brave Exvius edition of the franchise is free-to-play and has been available on various mobile devices in the U.S. from June last year .
Consumer prices may be more volatile than are represented in current inflation indexes , which are used to guide a range of economic decisions , including guidance on interest rates and Social Security cost-of-living adjustments , according to a team of economists .
In a series of studies , researchers examined how housing rents are assessed in official price indexes , such as the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics ' consumer price index , or CPI , and the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis 's index for personal consumption expenditure , or PCE , which are both designed to show price moves based on the prices of a collection of consumer goods . The rent information the bureaus collect may lead to errors in the inflation rates , said Jiro Yoshida , associate professor , the Penn State Smeal College of Business .
Both the CPI and PCE use results from questionnaires that are sent out to existing tenants to gather information about the housing rents , according to the researchers . Because the Bureau of Labor Statistics sends these questionnaires to the same people over time , they usually collect information on renewal rents , which tend to be less volatile than new rents , according to the researchers . Landlords do not always raise rents on existing tenants , but are more willing to change rents for new tenants , they added .
“ Landlords tend to increase rents when tenants change . The official rent surveys , then , tend to miss that big change , ” said Yoshida , who worked with Brent W. Ambrose , Smeal Professor of Risk Management and director of the Institute for Real Estate Studies , Penn State and N. Edward Coulson , professor emeritus of economics , Penn State and professor of economics and director of Research , Center for Real Estate , University of California , Irvine .
Rents make up an important part of the inflation indexes . In 2016 , the housing component — or shelter price — accounted for a third of the CPI and 42 percent of the core CPI , which excludes food and energy . In the PCE , rents account for 15.8 percent of all items and 17.7 percent of the core items .
The researchers , who released their findings online in the Journal of Macroeconomics and in a working paper on the Social Science Research Network , created a new method for estimating inflation in housing rents using data such as Moody's/RCA Commercial Property Price Index , or CPPI . This data set includes new and existing leases .
Based on their revised estimates , the researchers suggest that the official inflation rate was overestimated by 1.7 percent to 4.2 percent annually during the Great Recession and is underestimated by 0.3 percent to 0.9 percent annually during the current expansionary period .
These estimation errors could cause significant problems with contracts , public policy programs , asset prices , as well as corporate and consumer decisions , according to the researchers .
“ What we find is that by looking closely at one of the most important items in the consumption basket , which is housing , we have a much better idea about how price levels are changing in the economy , ” said Yoshida . “ The CPI is used in labor contracts , Social Security payments , and almost every economic statistics , so the implication is large . ”
For example , because cost-of-living adjustments are based on CPI , the cost-of-living adjustment under the researcher 's method would be about 6.3 percent higher . For a 70-year-old senior who retired in 2016 , the new calculation would have added about $ 167 to their or their monthly benefit .
Yoshida said that the lack of volatility in those indexes gave the researchers their first clue to the source of the problem with inflation indexes .
“ What we found was that housing rents are a little bit weird from our perspective in the official Bureau of Labor Statistics data , ” said Yoshida . “ The housing rents in those indexes are really smooth and they are growing all the time , even during the financial crisis . And we were not completely comfortable with that . ”

It 's still not clear when Canadians will be able to buy recreational marijuana . However , one thing is clear : cannabis will be an island unto itself when it comes to marketing .
Health Canada spent 60 days consulting Canadians on how cannabis should be marketed . On March 19 , it released a report that concluded cannabis must be sold in plain packaging that clearly states the risks and harms of cannabis use . The goal is to minimize its appeal to children and youth .

Why is cannabis being treated differently than tobacco ?
Why are cigarette companies allowed to market their product with distinctive labelling that still contains health warnings ?
The argument for plain packaging for tobacco has been made in the past , but nothing has changed .

I believe this is Ottawa 's chance to get things right from the get-go : keep the packaging simple with the appropriate warnings . However , it 's highly unfair that tobacco companies do n't have to play by the same rules .
This may be the government 's chance to level the “ marketing ” playing field and legislate that both cannabis and tobacco products be sold in plain packages .

GLENDALE , AZ - Arizona twins are going to have a unique story to tell for the rest of their lives after they were born in different years .
Holly and Brandon Shay were n't expecting their boys to arrive for another few weeks , however , they were shocked when Banner Hospital in Glendale admitted them on New Year 's Eve .
After six exhausting hours of labor , their first son , Sawyer , was born at 11:51 p.m .
“ I wanted to make sure they were OK , and they had to keep reminding me that I had to push , '' Holly said .
Just one minute after midnight on January 1 , 2017 , their second baby , Everett , was born .
The boys who previously shared nine months in the same space wo n't be sharing a birthday -- or even their birth year .
“ I think Sawyer might give their brother a hard time , ” Brandon said . “ I think it 's mostly going to be Sawyer teasing Everett over them being the eldest . ”

“ What we 're doing is we 're working really closely with the school that this person attends to ensure that all of the contacts or people who might have been close to them have been provided with information…and antibiotics which prevent you from getting the disease , ” Dr. Karin Goodison , Interior Health 's medical health officer , said .
The health region will also be offering immunizations at the school this week , they added .
“ This particular bacteria that causes more severe cases , we do see fatality rates as high as 10 to 15 per cent , ” Goodsin said .
Meningococcal disease is a bacterial infection that occurs rarely in Canada , according to Interior Health . It is reported most frequently in those from 15 to 24 years old .
“ In order to share these bacteria , you really have to , what I call , ‘ swap spit ' , ” Goodsin said . “ You do that by sharing glasses , by sharing utensils , by kissing . ”
“ We discourage you from sharing your drinks with other people , sharing cigarettes . ”
Symptoms can include a high fever , severe headaches , nausea and vomiting , stiff neck , rash , drowsiness or seizures . Anyone who suspects they have the disease should seek immediate medical attention .

The most recent case in Vernon follows at least two confirmed cases in Oliver .
“ What we do , is we look at the frequency of cases we 're getting in a population area and make determinations of whether it makes sense to start offering vaccinations more broadly , so we 're currently reviewing all of our information , ” Goodsin said .
The LA-based R & B singer Tinashe has encountered career roadblock after career roadblock since they released their great 2014 debut Aquarius . Despite strong singles like “ Flame , ” they ca n't get a released date for their sophomore album Joyride , though they did drop the stopgap Nightride last year . And in a recent interview , Tinashe seems to blame something other than record-label bureaucracy for their lack of success . To some extent , they seem to think that it stems from colorism .
Tinashe , who identified themselves as “ a pop artist who makes R & B-tinged pop music ” has mixed heritage ; their mother is Danish , and their father is a Zimbabwean immigrant . And in an interview with The Guardian , they claim that the black community might not be ready to accept a singer with their heritage :
There 's colorism involved in the black community , which is very apparent . It 's about trying to find a balance where I 'm a mixed woman , and sometimes I feel like I do n't fully fit into the black community ; they do n't fully accept me , even though I see myself as a black woman . That disconnect is confusing sometimes . I am what I am .
That statement has made Tinashe a trending topic on Twitter this morning ; a whole lot of people do not seem to agree . In any case , Tinashe also feels that it 's hard to be a black woman in pop if you 're not Rihanna or Beyoncé :
Recently , my cousin was with a friend of a friend , who was in high school , and they were like , “ I 'm a fan of Kehlani , ” but in a way that was like , “ So I ca n't be a fan of Tinashe , too. ” Then my friend posed the question , “ Why not be a fan of both ? ” It 's kind of like sport ; people feel like they have to pick a side… There are hundreds of [ male ] rappers that all look the same , that sound the same , but if you 're a black woman , you 're either Beyoncé or Rihanna . It 's very , very strange… It felt like they almost had to sacrifice someone because there was n't enough room , which is n't true .
And Tinashe also confirmed a recent rumor that Rihanna briefly took “ Joyride , ” which will hopefully eventually be the title track from Tinashe 's album , for herself :
Yeah , that 's true . But I do n't know if it was personally Rihanna , like , “ I 'm taking that from Tinashe. ” I do n't think that 's how it worked . But it 's back now… It 's definitely been discouraging , and I have days where I 'm less confident , but at the end I know that I 'm going to get to where I need to go . There 's doubt that seeps in , there 's self-deprecation , because you look to someone to blame and you ca n't blame anyone but yourself , but I 've never , ever thought , “ I 'm going to work in a mall . ”
Interviews like this make me think we should n't hold our breath for Joyride to come out anytime soon .

The rededication of `` The Survivor '' drew 200 people Saturday in Beaverton and was named an official World War I monument .
When the monument was dedicated in 1925 , it drew an estimated 3,000 people and Beaverton city 's population was 550 then .
Veteran and Beaverton Mayor Ray Nau , along with commander Bob Schafer of The American Legion Post 171 , accepted the document naming the monument an official World War I memorial . The World War I Centennial Commission presented the honor .
`` It is truly a pleasure to have this significant memorial in our community , '' Nau said , adding that in 1925 it was the first of its kind in Michigan .
Veteran Ed Rachwitz spearheaded the restoration endeavor . They were pleased with the number of people that attended and liked seeing many families . They think the memorial now `` pops out '' with the additional coloring and restoration .
Rachwitz thanked the community , politicians and group leaders who all helped secure funding for the concrete structure . They also thanked the artists , Chris Moran of South Boardman and Erick Forshee of Midland . Moran did the memorial 's front -- restoring , re-carving the original pieces lines and then coloring . Forshee did the sides and back . Plaques honoring the estimated 30 local fallen military is hoped to soon line the back of the monument .
Both artists agreed they did n't want to damage the integrity of the original artist 's vision . The original artist was Helmuth VonZengen .
`` It 's just stunning , '' said Helen Lomas of Midland , who stood in the baking sun and near 100-degree temperature to see it .
Keynote speaker 97th State House Rep. Jason Wentworth said this was their first dedication . They first asked their wife how to do one , and they referred them to Google .
Wentworth commented on how people came out with their families and the beautiful memorial . They said it is something the veterans and the community can take pride in .
The representative also noted that Sen. Jim Stamas helped to secure $ 5,000 just days before the rededication . Stamas also attended on Saturday .
Shannon Lorenz of Southfield was in town to visit family and took their three children to the event .
`` I turned it into a teaching moment , '' Lorenz said . `` We talked about what World War I meant and what sacrifices were made during that time .
'It really is an outstanding memorial and I 'm glad I got to see it and that my kids are old enough to appreciate it . ''
With recent changes , Flipboard has been placing a big emphasis on allowing readers to go deep on their interests . Now it 's adding even more features around one particular interest , in the Technology section of the Flipboard website and app .
“ We want to make Flipboard definitive for tech insiders and enthusiasts , ” said CEO Mike McCue .
This positions Flipboard as more of a direct competitor to a tech news aggregator like Techmeme , but with more curation from partners and from readers themselves .
The most immediately noticeable change is what the company describes as a “ newspaper-like , high-density layout. ” Basically , it moves away from the image-heavy look that Flipboard is known for , towards a layout that places a bigger emphasis on headlines and text , designed for quick scanning .
While McCue said the new look is “ really meant for the desktop , ” Flipboard has also created a version for the mobile web , and the app will also vary between a high-density and low-density layout depending on the stories . ( If it seems strange for Flipboard to be prioritizing its web experience , remember that the company has also been shifting its focus away from its own native article formats towards the mobile web . )
Regardless of which layout you 're seeing , the section will also have new content . Some of it will be curated by Flipboard publishers , with The Verge creating roundups for Gadgets News and Artificial Intelligence , the Wirecutter offering Deals of the Week and the team here at TechCrunch curating our latest Features .
“ Flipboard has really become more of an ecosystem , ” McCue said . “ Publishers and curators are curating stories around all sorts of different topics . We want to provide access to that ecosystem on any platform , with or without the app . ”
Teams can also create their own magazines , which are basically private collections of stories . So if you 're at a startup and want all of your colleagues to be up-to-date on the latest headlines about your industry and competitors , you can curate a magazine that 's only visible to them .
Flipboard will also be asking experts and influencers for book recommendations , starting with Wired Editor-in-Chief Nick Thompson 's roundup of “ Five Books I 've Recently Read About the Future . ”
And all of this will be rounded up in a daily email , which will include the latest tech headlines as well as selections from any team magazine you contribute to . On Saturday , the newsletter will focus on those book recommendations , with links to buy the titles on Amazon .
McCue suggested that if all this new content is embraced by readers , we might see Flipboard start to pursue a similar strategy around other topics , with a focus on reaching professional readers . Next up : Advertising .
Netflix is kicking the tires on a new high-end streaming plan — dubbed “ Ultra ” — to see whether consumers are willing to pay more for four Ultra HD streams or content in HDR format .
The Ultra plans cost $ 16.99 per month and is being tested in two versions . One offers four Ultra HD streams , while the existing $ 13.99 Premium plan would drop from four to two UHD streams . In the second offer , both Premium and Ultra customers would have access to four concurrent Ultra HD streams but only Ultra customers would have access to high dynamic range ( HDR ) content , which provides more vibrant color reproduction and higher contrast .
The new test offers were first reported by Italian tech blog TuttoAndroid.net .
Netflix first introduced the four-stream “ family plan ” in 2013 , as a premium alternative to the standard HD plan that provides access to two concurrent streams per account . A year later , it modified the packages so that Ultra HD content was available only in the higher-priced tier . Now Netflix is looking to see how many consumers value HDR versus four-stream access .
Netflix has confirmed the Ultra tests , and says only a subset of customers will be shown the higher-priced options . In addition , as with any of the company 's trial program , Netflix may not decide to more widely roll out the Ultra tier .
Netflix most recently raised prices in the fourth quarter of 2017 . It hiked the two-stream HD tier to $ 10.99 per month ( up from the previous $ 9.99 ) and the Premium plan from $ 11.99 to $ 13.99 per month . The single-stream , non-HD Basic plan remained unchanged at $ 7.99 .

Islamabad-A division bench of Islamabad High Court ( IHC ) yesterday suspended a single bench 's verdict wherein it had barred the private educational institutions of the federal capital from receiving tuition fee from the students for the months that come under summer vacations .
The IHC dual bench comprising of Justice Aamer Farooq and Justice Mohsin Akhtar Kayani conducted hearing of the Intra-Court Appeal ( ICA ) moved by the private schools and suspended the single bench 's order . Private schools through their counsel Sardar Muhammad Latif Khosa Advocate moved the ICA and adopted before the division bench that the single bench comprising Justice Shaukat Aziz Siddiqui issued this order without hearing their side .
They contended that the single bench 's order is liable to be set aside . After hearing their arguments , the dual bench suspended the single bench 's order .
Previously on May 18 through an interim order , Justice Siddiqui had restrained private educational institutions of Islamabad from receiving monthly fee from the students during summer vacations in the light of Lahore High Court ( LHC ) and Peshawar High Court ( PHC ) orders that had restrained private educational institutions from receiving tuition fee etc during summer vacations .
The single bench in its order had noted , “ The Private Educational Institutions Regulatory Authority ( PEIRA ) is directed that all private educational institutions are to be restrained from receiving fee for the period of summer vacations till the next date of hearing .
Amount of fee already paid by the parents/students shall be adjusted against fee for the period after vacations ” .
The court had issued this order in the writ petition of Jamshed Khan in their petition against a private school .
After suspending the single bench 's judgment , the division bench deferred the hearing while the date will be fixed by the registrar office .
WINNIPEG – The Winnipeg Jets put an end to their longest losing streak of the season .
Mathieu Perreault had a three point night as the Jets ended a three game slide with a 5-1 win over the visiting Vancouver Canucks on Monday at Bell MTS Place .
After a shaky first period in which the Jets mustered only four shots , Winnipeg settled down in the second and only got stronger as the game wore on .
“ I think the first period we gave them too much ice to play on. ” Nikolaj Ehlers said .
“ We were n't playing hard enough , and they got some big chances . But I think the second and third period we shut them down pretty well , scored on our chances , and played the way we wanted to play . ”
Perreault had two goals including the 100th of their career while Ehlers , Dmitry Kulikov , and Josh Morrissey each scored once in the victory .
“ That 's a darn good NHL win. ” head coach Paul Maurice said .
“ No part of our game was easy . What is difficult to do is what they did , is they got better in the second period . So we survived the first and there are times in the National Hockey League you need to survive . We did that in the first , come out even and then we got better and stronger . ”
With the victory the Jets have now won 11 of their 14 games on home ice this season including their last seven in a row .
“ Somehow we 've been doing it at home. ” Perreault said . “ I 'm not so sure why , but it seems like in this building we feel very comfortable in our game , and we 've been playing some solid hockey here . ”
It was the second time the Jets beat the Canucks this season after winning in Vancouver back in early October .
“ Sometimes it 's tough coming back home after a bit of a road trip , time change and that. ” Morrissey said . “ So we knew the first period was n't going to be super pretty which it was n't . But we found a way to grind and started to get our game going and sort of got better as the game went on . ”
Brock Boeser scored the Canucks only goal as Connor Hellebuyck turned aside 25 shots to stay unbeaten in regulation on home ice this season .

The Jets got right down to business , scoring just 88 seconds into the contest . Kulikov squeezed a point shot between the legs of Jacob Markstrom . Their second goal of the season was assisted by Mark Scheifele and Kyle Connor .
The Canucks then took the game over and answered back just a few minutes later . Henrik Sedin spotted a wide open Boeser in the slot and they ripped the shot past Hellebuyck for their 16th goal of the season . Daniel Sedin also had an assist on the Canucks ' first goal . It was tied after the opening period with the shots 10-4 in Vancouver 's favour .
The Jets ' fourth line put them back out in front five minutes into the middle stanza . Joel Armia fed Perreault in the slot and they buried the one-timer for their eighth goal of the season . Bryan Little also drew an assist as the Jets went up 2-1 .
Winnipeg added another goal on the powerplay later in the period . Tyler Myers sent a slapper on goal and Markstrom kicked the puck out right to Ehlers . They fired it in for their 14th goal of the season . Perreault had the secondary assist and it was a two goal Jets ' lead through two periods . Winnipeg outshot Vancouver 11-7 in the period .
The Jets added an insurance marker with just over eight minutes left in regulation . Racing in on the odd man rush Adam Lowry threw the puck out front and Morrissey shoveled the puck past Markstrom for the Jets fourth goal . Andrew Copp also had an assist on Morrissey 's fourth goal of the campaign .
In the final minute Markstrom sent the puck up the middle of the ice right to Matt Hendricks . They shot the puck towards the open goal and it went off Perreault 's stick and in . It was Perreault 's 100th career NHL goal as the Jets held on for the 5-1 triumph .

Steve Mason was taken off injured reserve earlier on Monday to dress as Hellebuyck 's backup . They missed the last two weeks with a concussion .
Dustin Byfuglien was scratched for the Jets after suffering a lower body injury that will keep them out of the lineup until after the Christmas break . Marko Dano and Shawn Matthias also sat out for Winnipeg .
The Jets are back in action on Thursday when they wrap up their mini two game homestand against Jonathan Toews and the Chicago Blackhawks .

A superb Neymar free-kick helped Paris Saint-Germain to a 3-0 win at troubled Lille on Saturday as the Ligue 1 leaders began a decisive month as they mean to go on .
The world 's most expensive player netted the second goal at the Stade Pierre-Mauroy after Yuri Berchiche had opened the scoring just prior to half-time .
Giovani Lo Celso 's delightful chip secured the victory late on , with PSG now 11 points clear of Marseille at the top of the table .
PSG have won 12 of their last 13 games in all competitions , including four in a row since a 2-1 defeat at Lyon last month .
Their season-defining Champions League last-16 tie against Real Madrid is fast approaching , with the first leg to come in the Spanish capital on 14 February .
`` The best preparation for the match in Madrid is to be competitive in every match and work on the things that we can improve , '' said PSG coach Unai Emery .
They will hope to have the likes of Adrien Rabiot , Julian Draxler and Thiago Motta back fit for that game , while Kylian Mbappe will almost certainly start at the Santiago Bernabeu .
The teenage France forward was absent on Saturday due to suspension after being sent off in the 3-2 League Cup semi-final win at Rennes in midweek .
`` A lot of things can still happen . I can not say today who is going to play in Madrid , that is impossible . I just hope the best is still to come , '' added Emery , whose team have a French Cup tie at Sochaux to come on Tuesday .
In Mbappe 's absence , Angel Di Maria again started alongside Neymar and Edinson Cavani in attack , but the Uruguayan was unable to add to their club record tally of 157 goals .
Spaniard Berchiche was handed a start ahead of Layvin Kurzawa at left-back and they broke the deadlock right on half-time , drilling home after a poor attempted clearance by Junior Alonso fell to him .
Lille is a club with serious off-field worries , concerns about their finances leading to them being handed a transfer embargo that prevented them from adding to their squad in January .
Sports daily L'Equipe even reported on Saturday that the club had been told they face being relegated at the end of the season if their financial situation does not hugely improve , regardless of their final league position .
Christophe Galtier 's side had looked set to go into the break on level terms before Berchiche struck , and they were upset that Cavani was not flagged offside in the build-up to that goal .
Just 13 minutes remained when Neymar effectively ended the game as a contest , finding the top-left corner with a free-kick from right on the edge of the area .
It was the Brazilian 's 18th goal in 17 Ligue 1 appearances , with seven of those coming in their last three outings .
Lo Celso arguably topped Neymar 's effort with their chip over Lille goalkeeper Mike Maignan , as the young Argentine again stood in well for the veteran Motta . The assist had come from new signing Lassana Diarra , on as a substitute for their league debut .

WICHITA , Kan. ( AP ) — U.S. Sen. Pat Roberts is defending the Senate filibuster rule amid some unusual backlash from their Republican House colleagues and constituents at a conference of independent oil and gas producers .
But Roberts concedes Republicans may have to do away with it in order to pass their agenda .
The sometimes testy exchanges Monday came at the convention of the Kansas Independent Oil and Gas Association .
Rep. Lynn Jenkins won scattered applause when they called for getting rid of the filibuster , saying Congress is “ crippled ” right now .
Roberts says Republican control of the Senate can easily flip , noting they have been in the minority more often than they have been in the majority .
Rep. Kevin Yoder reminded people that health care repeal failed even though it only needed 51 votes to pass .
The decision to drive under the influence of alcohol often comes with a steep price .
For Raymond Gene Rogers , a guilty plea to two DUI charges earned them a sentence of 20 years , according to District Attorney Joel Smith . Circuit Judge Larry Bourgeois presided over the hearing and sentenced Rogers to 10 years suspended , and 10 years to be served in the custody of the Mississippi Department of Corrections .
The first conviction for the Long Beach resident stemmed from an accident on West Old Pass Road in October 2017 . The Long Beach Police Department had a search warrant and the defendant 's blood was drawn at a local hospital to be tested by the Mississippi Crime Lab .
Reports say Rogers ' blood-alcohol content was 0.389 % , more than four times the legal limit at the time of their arrest . After their arrest , the defendant posted bond in the amount of $ 25,000 and was released . Rogers later admitted that they drank an entire bottle of Crown Royal and was on their way to the store to buy more .
`` The defendant admitted to the police officer during the traffic stop that they were driving a different car than before because the other car had an ignition interlock device , and they did not want to blow to crank the car , knowing they would likely not pass , '' said ADA Billy Stage , who prosecuted the case .
The second conviction resulted from a concerned citizen calling the Long Beach Police Department and a traffic stop by the Long Beach Police Department on Railroad Street , just after 10:00 p.m. , in February 2018 .
Following a search warrant to draw their blood , the Crime Lab determined the Rogers ' blood-alcohol content was .206 % .
`` The defendant has demonstrated that they are a danger to the law-abiding citizens who occupy our roadways by their repeated decisions to drive while intoxicated . Drunk driving is a crime of choice and can not be tolerated , '' stated DA Joel Smith .

BUENOS AIRES ( Reuters ) - The world 's financial leaders sought on Monday to endorse free trade amid concerns over U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminium , while the United States said it could not sacrifice its national interests to make the system work .
Finance ministers and central bank governors of the world 's 20 biggest economies are meeting in Buenos Aires to discuss the global economic outlook , capital flows , cryptocurrencies like bitcoin , and how to stop corporate tax avoidance .
But since U.S. President Donald Trump 's decision on March 8 to impose tariffs of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminium , trade has become the focal point of the meeting .
“ I am seriously concerned that the foundation of our prosperity - free trade - is being put at risk , ” German Finance Minister Olaf Scholz told German mass-selling newspaper Bild .
“ Protectionism is not the answer to the difficulties of our time . The situation is serious , ” they said , adding that they would be cautious yet about referring to a trade war .
But U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin pushed the Trump administration 's emphasis on “ free trade with reciprocal terms . ”
“ There 's no doubt that the secretary represents the president 's very strong view that we believe in free trade , ” one U.S. official told reporters .
“ But the environment we 're in now , where the expectation is America totally subordinates its national interests in order for the free trade system to work , is just one we do n't accept . So , we 've been very clear , we believe in free trade with reciprocal terms that leads to more balanced trade relationships , ” they said .
On Sunday , Scholz said they would seek to dissuade Washington from imposing the steel and aluminium tariffs , which come into effect on March 23 .
Others at the G20 meeting , which will conclude on Tuesday with a joint communique , shared Germany 's concern .
“ There is a solid understanding among the global community that free trade is important , ” Haruhiko Kuroda , Japan 's central bank governor , told reporters upon arriving for the talks .
The U.S. steel and aluminium tariffs have raised alarms among trading partners that Trump is following through on their threats to dismantle the trading system based around World Trade Organization rules in favor instead of unilateral U.S. actions .

Many U.S. allies , including the European Union , have sought the same exemptions that Trump has granted to North American neighbors Canada and Mexico , with some G20 ministers raising the issue with Mnuchin .
After meeting with U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross in Washington , German Economy Minister Peter Altmaier said they and Ross agreed that U.S.-EU talks on the tariffs should be intensified .
“ We are convinced that free trade is the best solution to guarantee the well-being of our peoples . We want that world trade remains fair and void of dumping measures , ” Altmaier said .

CHINA TARIFF THREAT
Potentially broader anti-China tariffs and investment restrictions under consideration as part of a U.S. intellectual property probe have raised concerns that retaliation could hit world trade and choke off the strongest global growth since the G20 was formed during the financial crisis a decade ago .
Morgan Stanley economists said in a report to clients late on Sunday that a broad-based application of U.S. “ Section 301 ” remedies resulting in a 20 percent tariff on Chinese manufactured goods , coupled with a commensurate response from China , would slash annual growth rates in both countries by a full percentage point within a year .
An early draft of the G20 communique seen by Reuters contained the phrase “ international trade and investment are important engines of growth . ”
It also said G20 finance ministers stood by an agreement reached by their leaders in July last year in Hamburg . A G20 official said discussions now centered on whether that language on trade would remain in the communique , which has to be endorsed unanimously , including by the United States .
The agreement from Hamburg , to which the Buenos Aires draft referred , said : “ We note the importance of bilateral , regional and plurilateral agreements being open , transparent , inclusive and WTO-consistent , and commit to working to ensure they complement the multilateral trade agreements . ”
The Hamburg agreement , signed by all G20 leaders including Trump , said G20 countries would fight protectionism including all unfair trade practices , although it also said they recognise the role of “ legitimate trade defence instruments . ”
“ The problem is that everybody understands the Hamburg wording differently ” a senior European official said .
Unilateral decisions by the United States to impose tariffs are seen as going against negotiated , or “ multilateral ” measures that would be part of the WTO . Yet the U.S. can also argue its tariffs are a “ legitimate trade defence instrument . ”
The draft G20 communique also said that while the global economic outlook has been improving , “ a retreat to inward looking policies ” - suggesting protectionist trade practices - was a risk to growth .

NEW YORK , Feb 2 ( Reuters ) - Federal prosecutors on Friday charged a New York man with bilking investors out of $ 5.3 million by misrepresenting themselves as a successful fund manager linked to the family behind the former Genovese drug store chain
In a criminal complaint unsealed in Manhattan federal court , prosecutors accused Nicholas Genovese of defrauding investors in their purported hedge fund Willow Creek Investments LP since at least 2015 . The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission also announced a related civil case .
A lawyer for Genovese could not immediately be identified . Nicholas Biase , a spokesperson for federal prosecutors in Manhattan , said on Friday afternoon that Genovese was in custody and would appear in court later in the day .
According to the SEC , Genovese falsely claimed that they managed $ 4 billion of assets for the family behind Genovese Drug Stores , a drug store chain that once operated in the New York City area . They also falsely claimed that their fund achieved annual returns of 30 percent to 40 percent , when in fact it lost money , the SEC said .
Prosecutors said in the criminal complaint that Genovese falsely claimed to have a master 's degree in business administration from Dartmouth College and to have worked at Goldman Sachs and Bear Stearns .
Authorities said Genovese used investor funds to trade in their personal brokerage account , losing more than $ 8 million between 2015 and 2017 . The SEC said $ 263,000 of the money went to fund Genovese 's lifestyle , including being chauffeured in a Bentley .
Genovese 's fraud was “ ongoing ” at the time the charges were filed , the SEC said . ( Reporting By Brendan Pierson in New York ; Editing by Tom Brown )

Rawalpindi - Former interior minister Chaudhry Nisar Ali Khan said they had played a vital role in making ex-prime minister Mian Nawaz Sharif a leader in party but in return Nawaz had displayed open enmity and disloyalty towards him .
“ I always took care of Mian Nawaz Sharif during 34 years of association but they ( Nawaz ) never did anything for me ” Nisar said while addressing a public gathering at Ranyal on Tuesday .
The public meeting was arranged by Chairman UC Ranyal Raja Sajid and attended by scores of local leaders and supporters .
Chaudhry Nisar Ali Khan said Pakistan is facing great threats but the politicians are confronting the institutions in greed of power . They said those shouting in electioneering campaigns can not save Pakistan from dangers and threats . “ All the stakeholders are engaged in expressing hate against each other while ignoring the threats being faced by country , ” they said . Nisar lashed out against their political opponents saying they change their directions with wind . They said their opponent in NA-59/NA-63 and PP-10/PP-12 managed to hold public office under the shadow of former military dictator Gen ( retd ) Pervaiz Musharraf and is now taking refuge of Imran Khan to get into power .
They said they were not greedy for power and preferred to resign from office of Interior Minister after differences emerged with party leadership .
They said they had never applied for party ticket or appeared for interview before party leadership . “ Then why should I do it during general elections ? ” they asked . Nisar added that Imran Khan had offered them to join their camp besides offering tickets but they denied the offer . Chaudhry Nisar predicted that the jeep , their election symbol , will win on July 25 , 2018 . They claimed that they restored peace and order in troubled Karachi by launching an operation in the city . They said there are many who are raising slogans in favour of Khatam-e-Nabuwat and Namoos-e-Risalat but none of them seemed serious in this regard .
Later , Chaudhry Nisar Ali Khan also addressed a mammoth public gathering at UC Dhama . The meeting was arranged by PML-N Chairman Chaudhry Imran Ilyas and attended by Chaudrhy Ilyas , Syed Asad Abbas Kazmi , Syed Jamil Hussain Kazmic Raja Nisar and many others .
On the occasion , Sajjad Khan , PML-N local leader , has announced to join Nisar camp after they were not awarded party ticket for PP-11 by Mian Nawaz Sharif .
Addressing the meeting , Chaudhry Imran Ilyas said they would support Nisar Ali Khan during elections 2018 . They said their voters and supporters would stamp on the jeep on July 25 .
Police and other law enforcement agencies made tight security arrangements for guarding Nisar and other participants of public gathering .
Earlier , Nisar was accorded a warm welcome by the jubilant workers of N league .
They were chanting slogans against Mian Nawaz Sharif and in favour of Chaudhry Nisar Ali Khan .
On the other hand , PTI candidate for NA-59/63 and PP-10/12 Ghulam Sarwar had inaugurated an election office of Haji Amjad at Morgah besides addressing crowded public gathering at Khayaban-e-Jinnah on Adiala Road . The public meeting was arranged by PML-N disgruntled local leader Raja Qayyum . Ghulam Sarwar criticised dual policies of Chaudhry Nisar Ali Khan and asked people to vote for bat , the election symbol of PTI .
COLOMBO ( Reuters ) - Maldives President Abdulla Yameen will lift a 45-day state of emergency on Thursday and the government will bring bribery charges against former leader Maumoon Abdul Gayoom and the chief justice , said a senior Maldives diplomat .

Yameen imposed a state of emergency on Feb. 5 for 15 days to annul a Feb. 1 Supreme Court ruling that quashed convictions against nine opposition leaders and ordered their government to free those held in prison . They later extended the state of emergency for another 30 days with parliament approval , a move challenged by the opposition .
Under the emergency , Yameen 's administration arrested former president Maumoon Abdul Gayoom , the chief justice , another Supreme Court judge , and a Supreme Court administrator on allegations of attempting to overthrow the government . They have all rejected the charges .
“ Unless something unusual happens , we should not have emergency by Thursday , ” Mohamed Hussain Shareef , Maldives Ambassador for Sri Lanka told a Foreign Correspondents Association forum on Monday .
“ The government has no intention of extending it any further barring very unusual circumstances like widespread violence . The intention is to do away with this state of emergency when the current 30 day period expires on March 22 . ”
Shareef said bribery charges against Chief Justice Abdulla Saeed and Supreme Court Judge Ali Hameed have been sent to the prosecutor general and that bribery charges will also be brought against former president Gayoom and Supreme Court administrator Hassan Sayeed .
“ That is definite . We know that charges will be pressed against the four of them , ” Shareef said .
Gayoom is accused of bribing the three legal professionals to overthrow the Yameen government .
Despite opposition claims that hundreds of people have been arrested under the state of emergency , Shareef said only 38 had been arrested so far while others were “ detained and released ” .
Maldives police told Reuters on Saturday that at least 139 opposition protesters were arrested as they attempted to defy orders under the state of emergency and march into the high security zone in capital Male .
When asked if any foreign agent or country had a role in the Maldives crisis , Shareef said : “ For my knowledge , the investigations at the moment are focused on local actors only ” .
Rights group Amnesty International has said the Maldivian government was using the emergency “ as a licence for repression , targeting members of civil society , judges and political opponents ” .
Yameen 's government retains a majority in parliament in the absence of the opposition 's 12 MPs who were stripped of their seats by Yameen 's party for defecting last year .

Not unlike an alchemist , Icelandic Hafsteinn Gunnar Sigurðsson has mastered the improbable formula to produce amalgamations of universality with specificity . Their relatable confections transcend homegrown appeal and become notable enough not only for distribution abroad , but have even been reimagined with American nuances .
Sigurðsson 's first feature , 2011 's Either Way , was adapted and remade by eclectic director David Gordon Green as the Paul Rudd and Emile Hirsch-starring Prince Avalanche . Sharing the borderless qualities of that project , their most recent film , Under the Tree , could also take advantage of the human propensity for retaliation and vengeance .
A tree in a suburban family 's backyard physically represents the central dispute , but that 's simply the excuse for darker sentiments to emerge . Inga ( Edda Björgvinsdóttir ) , the stone-faced matriarch , is willing to go to disturbing lengths in order to defend the tree , which cast a shadow over their neighbors ' home . To her , what 's at stake is not only the plant 's survival , but their sovereignty . Them husband , Baldvin ( Sigurður Sigurjónsson , whom you might recall from Rams ) , supports their vicious attacks on the couple next door : a middle-aged man living with a younger , fitness-obsessed woman—but they are not aware of what they are capable of doing . Meanwhile , Inga and Baldvin 's son , Atli ( Steinþór Hróar Steinþórsson ) is trying to handle a marital separation caused by their deviant sexual behavior . As the family 's territorial clash collide with Atli 's marital woes , the consequences spread far beyond the tree 's branches reach .
Hafsteinn Gunnar Sigurðsson visited Los Angeles during awards season and sat down with MovieMaker to talk about the incidents that sparked their interest in neighborly conflicts , hiring comedians in bittersweet roles , and viewing their work in another context and language .
Carlos Aguilar , MovieMaker Magazine ( MM ) : Was personal inspiration part of the inception of the film , or are there elements that come directly from reality ? Did you have terrible neighbors yourself ?
Hafsteinn Gunnar Sigurdsson ( HGS ) : We have a lot of famous cases like this in Iceland : famous neighborly conflicts over trees , and they really spiral out of control and end up in court , and cats disappear . Very normal , respectable people start acting in a crazy way , and I think it has something to do with the fact that the home is a very sacred place , and if somebody else is trying to tell you how your home should be , that really strikes a nerve in people that can bring out aggression and violence . That was the beginning , and what drew me to this material . Although it 's not a true story or anything , that was the inspiration .
MM : Your previous films have been about people in very small towns . Tell me about bringing your stories to the city in Under the Tree , with characters and people in the periphery .
HGS : It was fun and challenging at the same time . I really wanted to do something a little bit different—take a step forward and challenge myself—maybe do a bit more of a plot driven movie . It was fun and challenging at the same time . It seemed like a natural progression from my previous work . You can find a lot of similarities in tone , although this film is a little bit darker . It felt right to me , to go down this path .
MM : How important is location in your films , and how did you find , in this particular film , the picture-perfect neighborhood ? Houses are perfectly arranged and everyone seems to be normal—not wealthy—but comfortably middle class .
HGS : It 's very important , and especially for this film , it 's really the world of the story . It really sets the tone . It 's a place where violence and aggression is very far away . This is the world I wanted to set up , so the way it turns out is kind of unexpected . It 's a little bit like the beginning of Blue Velvet , where you have this beautiful , perfect suburbia , and then you have this darkness boiling underneath .
MM : Did you deliberately scout to find these particular homes with the qualities required to tell the story , such as the backyards and the tree ?
HGS : Yeah , it was a really tough location for me to find . I scouted all over Reykjavik and neighboring towns as well , until I found these houses that were actually made by an architect I like a lot from the 60s . They are painted in this kind of signature blue . It was a very difficult location , because it had to work aesthetically and also practically . You had to have these two back yards next to each , that should be intimate in a way , where you have this problem of the shadow .
Finally , when we found this location , which was working from all aspects , it did n't have the tree , so we actually had to find the tree somewhere else , cut it and move it to a big open space , and we shot it from all possible angles . Then we cut the crown off the tree , and moved the trunk to the location , and then we had to add the crown again in the post-production . It does n't seem like a big VFX technical thing , but it was really a challenge to make that work . The tree is one of the main characters in the film ! The tree itself had to be special in a way .
MM : I wanted to ask you about Edda Björgvinsdóttir . They steal every scene that she 's in . I understand she 's a renowned performer in Iceland ; was they your first choice , and how did you come to cast her ?
HGS : They are a very talented comedian in Iceland . She 's known for completely different things than this , so this is their first big dramatic role in a film—which I think they do fantastically . It was actually an idea from one of the producers , and I had n't thought about them They had that depth of the tragedy , but at the same time they had this sarcastic tone that was very important for this character . My approach in the casting was casting actors who have natural comedic qualities , because the story , in the end is a tragedy , and I did n't want it to move in more melodramatic ways . I wanted actors who had the comedy in them , so I would never have to push for it—it would come naturally .
MM : Steinþór Hróar Steinþórsson portrays a difficult character to like because at times they embody the worst of male entitlement—he does n't even really understand what he 's done .
HGS : They are also a well-known comedian , and this is their first time doing a serious dramatic role . Again , it was an idea from someone else , and they turned out to be fantastic in the audition . Their comedic quality made Atli a little bit dangerous . You do n't know what 's going to happen , and they might just explode . I was extremely happy with all of the actors , but these two were really good . Icelandic audiences have been very interested to see them doing this , because they 're known for completely different things .
MM : Is there room for improvisation in a film like this , which seems to have such calibrated and specific tone ? What was your process like in terms of building rapport between the actors and constructing these family relationships ?
HGS : We do n't really improvise , but there 's a lot of space for ideas . I like to sit and read and talk about the script a lot , so all of the actors and I are on the same page—to create an environment where all ideas are welcome . Then it 's my call to deduce what works for the film and what does n't .
Another thing I like to do is to spend at least a week before shooting on location with the actors , where we rehearse a couple of scenes . The DP is often present for these rehearsals as well . The actors have often told me that they appreciate this very much , because often they 're walking into a set with the whole circus there , and they 've never been in that location before , and it 's supposed to have been their home for 30 years or something . So they really value having this time without the whole crew in there—to feel and experience it . It also helps me a lot too , just to be there and to make a lot of the big decisions before the whole crew comes in . Because then , there 's just so much going on . Filmmaking is all about preparing , and you get more out of your days if you have the opportunity to make decisions beforehand .
MM : Your film , Either Way , was remade in the US as Prince Avalanche . Was it a shock to see your story in another language being told with other actors in an American setting ?
HGS : Of course . I said to someone that when I went to the premiere at Sundance for Prince Avalanche it was a little bit like seeing an ex-girlfriend with a new boyfriend . That was the first time I saw it , and the entire time I was comparing , “ Is it really like that ? ” I thought David [ Gordon Green ] was very faithful to the original story . I saw it a second time , and then I really appreciated it , because I sort of knew what I was getting into .
MM : You said Under the Tree is a film that could work anywhere in the world . In that sense , what makes it specifically Icelandic ?
HGS : There 's something about the tree thing . In Europe , the Spanish have a little bit difficulty understanding it , because they want to be in the shade . It 's so hot there . But in Iceland , we want the sun , because it 's not as hot . There are things like that , and there 's something in the characters that 's specifically Icelandic . Maybe in the humor , but it 's hard for me to say . I think it 's very local , but it 's a story that you can set in many places .
MM : How difficult is it to finance films in Iceland ?
HGS : It 's always hard with film , but luckily we have a film fund where we can get government support , and we co-produce with other European countries . It works . We 'd like the fund to be bigger to make a little bit more , but if you have a good script , and you 're determined about the movie , it will be made eventually . It 's always tricky with financing in film , wherever you are .
MM : Many of the Icelandic films that reach international festivals often deal with pastoral narratives with vast landscapes . Have people been surprised or particularly interested in Under the Tree because it 's an Icelandic film about middle class families rather than the countryside ?
HGS : Icelandic cinema has been famous for the landscapes and that approach , and often that 's been more interesting to foreign audiences than the Icelandic ones . Because of that , Under the Tree has been very much appreciated by Icelandic audiences . They get to see something that 's closer to their everyday life . MM

RIYADH - Cross-border rebel fire from Yemen has killed a soldier in Saudi Arabia , which is leading a coalition fighting the insurgents in its war-torn neighbour , the interior ministry said .
The soldier was killed on Saturday in the southern border area of Jazan as an army post came under a barrage of gunfire and shelling from the Huthi rebels in northern Yemen , state news agency SPA quoted a ministry spokesperson as saying .
PANAJI : Despite the assurance given by Prime Minister Narendra Modi that after 50 days of demonetisation of the high-value currency notes , things will start falling in place , business in the state 's capital city of Panaji continues to suffer .
The Centre had suddenly announced demonetisation of the currency notes of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 on November 8 .
This reporter met over 50 vendors in the city municipal market and the general opinion was that trade continues to take a beating owing to demonetisation .
“ We could not even feel it was a New Year occasion . We lost around 75 per cent of our business in the festive season , ” said a shop owner trading in party items . “ For average business people like us , festivals like Diwali , Ganesh Chaturthi , Eid , Christmas and New Year are the only times to earn money to make up for the lean period , usually in monsoon , ” they said . The shop owner felt that introduction of the card swipe machines for small scale business concerns were not feasible at all . “ They are meant for big shopping malls , shopping complexes and big business people dealing in crores , ” they said .
Terming demonetisation as a political gimmick , a flower vendor in the city market said that Modi is a true politician , who promised to ease the tension within 50 days “ but their government is troubling 125 crore citizens to teach a lesson to a few tax evaders. ” “ No doubt , it was a good move to bring out money from the tax evaders but of late , they have realised that not even five lakh people are paying taxes honestly , ” said the flower vendor and added that they had to face a tough time soon after demonetisation was announced . He , however , said that dealing with corporate houses was not much of a problem for him , as they usually paid them by way of cheque .
Though the Prime Minister 's idea to generate money from hoarders of black money or tax evaders was great , some bankers , however , spoiled the show by indulging in corrupt practices and irregular transactions involving new currency , said a vegetable vendor . They said that the Prime Minister , however , was helpless in initiating any action against them .
Fish vendors claimed that the market health has been deteriorating by the day since November 9 . “ People are now scared to spend lavishly on fish . Earlier , people bought fish worth Rs 200 , Rs 300 or even more , but now they are satisfied with fish worth only Rs 100 . It appears that the situation will not improve in the near future , ” said many depressed fish vendors .
Manager of Royal Foods , which deals in chicken products , said that business was limping back to normalcy . He , however , said that it will take another three months to recover fully from the shock of demonetisation . They said , “ There is no crowd in the shop as we used to experience earlier . If this is the fate of business in the beginning of 2017 , on January 1 and January 2 when people get their salaries , then you can imagine and draw a conclusion , ” they said .
New Delhi : The BCCI on Saturday announced a cash reward of Rs 50 lakh for the U-19 chief coach Rahul Dravid while the victorious squad members will receive Rs 30 lakh each .
The other members of the support staff including fielding coach Abhay Sharma and bowling coach Paras Mhambrey will be richer by Rs 20 lakh .
In a marked departure from the usual norm where the players , who have done it on the field get greater share of the prize money , the COA-led BCCI has decided that the chief coach should get the biggest share .
`` India is known for its guru shishya parampara and the Guru always gets more . Obviously , the stature of the coach matters a lot , '' a senior office-bearer , who was a part of the policy decision told PTI on Saturday .
However , it must be noted that neither Dav Whatmore ( 2008 India coach ) nor Bharath Arun ( 2012 coach ) got more than the Virat Kohli or Unmukt Chand-led team .
Congratulating the team for beating Australia in the final BCCI Committee of Administrators ( COA ) chief Vinod Rai said , `` I congratulate the U19 team who have made the country proud .
Head Coach Rahul Dravid played their cricket with sincerity and it was pleasing to see the boys uphold the value . ''
BCCI acting president CK Khanna said , `` The boys have shown tremendous maturity in the manner they dominated the proceedings from the first match . They always looked like champions . My heartiest congratulations to the boys and Rahul , who has been like a pillar for this team . ''
Khanna said they will recommend that the U-19 selection committee chaired by Venkatesh Prasad also gets financial reward just like the senior men 's and women 's panel that went home richer despite their respective teams losing World Cup finals .
BCCI Acting Secretary Amitabh Choudhary , said , `` It is a proud day for everyone associated with the BCCI and Indian cricket . India is the only team to have qualified for the final of the last three ICC events . ''
BCCI CEO Rahul Johri said , `` Winning the World Cup without losing a solitary game is a fantastic achievement and I congratulate everyone for this dominant show . ''
`` In Rahul Dravid , we have a fantastic coach who is moulding the youngsters and also fine-tuning the boys at the India A level before they progress to the senior side , '' they added .
Narendra Modi 's charge of Pakistani interference in Gujarat election is little more than political gamesmanship aimed at putting the Congress under pressure . From the details that have emerged , it seems likely that Congress leaders schmoozing with guests from Pakistan at host Mani Shankar Aiyar 's residence last Wednesday had bilateral relationship and Kashmir on the menu along with the dinner .
Secretive though the meeting was and notwithstanding Congress ' curious behaviour around it , there was probably no grand Pakistani conspiracy to meddle in India 's electoral process . Modi has been trying to own the 'nationalism ' space and in Congress ' decision to hold a clandestine meeting with Pakistani diplomats bang in the middle of an Assembly election , they saw an opportunity to press home the advantage .
That said , Manmohan Singh needs to come down from their pedestal . Their acts of pious outrage are becoming a little too common , as are their indiscretions . Since they have the habit of taking themselves too seriously , the former prime minister needs to be reminded that this is a democracy , and no one is above reproach .
The indignant outrage that marks Singh 's press statement can not hide the fact that they have shown poor judgement on several counts in attending a Track 2 diplomatic effort at the residence of Aiyar , an individual who sees themselves as a supra-Constitutional figure above all arms of the state .
One , unlike the Indian journalists and diplomats who had attended the undeclared dinner meeting , Singh is n't just a private citizen but a former prime minister . They remain bound by the oath of secrecy , and therefore their presence lent the 'private dinner meeting ' a gravitas and legitimacy which otherwise would have been just another unofficial diplomatic soiree .
Given the fact that a serving Pakistan high commissioner was present and bilateral relationship was scheduled as an agenda , Singh clearly stepped out of their line in holding quasi-official talks with Pakistan government representatives in contravention of India 's policy of not talking to the enemy state unless it stops exporting terror to India .
Singh 's act of indiscretion not only sends a wrong message to Pakistan but also undermines India 's stand and undoes the government 's efforts in trying to diplomatically isolate Islamabad . Instead of seeking an apology , the former prime minister must clarify the reasons behind their decision to attend the meeting .
The BJP has been quick to point out that Opposition parties are also part of the state apparatus and as members of the Opposition , they had followed strictly the stand taken by the government of the day . `` Senior Congress leaders must desist from such misadventure and come out with detailed facts on what transpired in that meeting and what was the necessity of having it under present circumstances . Yesterday , they were in denial about it and , today , instead of accepting it as a misadventure , they are trying to blame those raising the issue . When we were in the opposition too , we have followed the government 's policy in this regard , '' Finance Minister Arun Jaitley told the media in a day of multiple news conferences by both parties .
Two , before engaging with representatives of a terrorist state bypassing the official channels of communication , the former prime minister should have kept the government in the loop . It is n't clear whether Singh had done so . It is poor defence to say that former Pakistan foreign minister Khurshid Mahmud Kasuri was given a visa and therefore , the government was aware of the modalities of the meeting .

Singh themselves admits that India-Pakistan relations were discussed . Their undeclared presence raises several troubling questions that can not be deflected on the pretext of getting `` pained and anguished '' .
Three , Singh 's dishonest protestations betray a logical fallacy . They accuse Modi of trying to spread `` falsehood and canards '' and for their `` insatiable desire to tarnish every Constitutional office , including that of a former Prime Minister and Army Chief '' .
After denying that such a meeting had actually taken place , Congress later clarified that it was merely a dinner , and wanted to know `` since when was this rule put in place that one has to seek permission from the government to host or attend a dinner ? ''
If we go by Congress ' contention that it was merely a `` social dinner '' attended by private citizens , Singh stands deprived of their pretentiousness that they are a holder of a Constitutional office , and therefore their charge of Modi `` tarnishing '' such offices is absurd . After all , Singh is a former prime minister , not the incumbent at 7 Lok Kalyan Marg .
If , however , we take Singh 's argument that they are indeed the holder of high office and Modi has made a cardinal error in sullying them and their position , the question that then arises is what business does the holder of a 'Constitutional office ' have in attending a meeting with representatives of Pakistan government in direct breach of protocol ? Did Indian citizens vote out Congress and elect BJP so that a former prime minister may set policy issues ? Who gave Singh and their party the authority to violate India 's stated position ?
The optics of a former prime minister holding a clandestine meeting with actors of an enemy state that has fought three wars with India and continues to foment terror inside our borders are n't nice , and that too in the middle of an important election in a border state .
Singh 's fulminations are useless . So are their arguments of trying to equate undeclared Track 2 diplomatic rendezvous with Modi 's official meeting with Nawaz Sharif in Lahore . Modi went there as the prime minister of India , ex-PM Singh 's effort is an undeclared , unsanctioned one .
Finally , Congress 's defence is based entirely on the integrity of Singh 's character , as if that alone addresses all questions surrounding the irresponsible act . Singh , too , tries to suggest that their track record of public service is enough to place them beyond scrutiny . One is n't sure whether an unqualified certificate of integrity can be issued against a former prime minister who presided over some of India 's greatest scams . Congress may issue such certificates at will , and Singh may delude themselves into taking those seriously . For the rest of the country , Singh 's 'personal integrity ' is an overplayed card .
New York Yankees outfielder Brett Gardner told Newsday that they were fined `` thousands of dollars '' in June for violating Major League Baseball 's pace-of-play rules and he 's not happy about it .
The New York Post reported the total Gardner was fined was approximately $ 3,500 .
Gardner told reporters that `` nothing I say about that is going to do me any good , '' but they made it clear to Newsday that they are n't happy about being singled out for taking too long , in MLB 's opinion , to get into the batter 's box .
`` My agent started taking care of it , '' Gardner said . `` I told them do n't talk to me about it . I 've got more things to worry about than taking three seconds too long to get to the box . Somebody else can ( throw pickoff throws to first base ) 27 times in a game and waste 15 minutes of everybody 's time , and I get fined thousands of dollars taking three seconds too long to get in the box . ''
Gardner is n't the first player to be fined for violating MLB 's pace-of-play policy . Although MLB does n't publicly disclose fines , Baltimore Orioles outfielder Adam Jones estimated in an interview with MLB Network Radio on SiriusXM last December that they were fined $ 50,000 last season for violating the rules .

The Montreal Canadiens have signed backup goalie Al Montoya to a two-year extension , the team announced Monday .
The deal is worth an average of $ 1.065 million per season , a source told ESPN.com .
By extending Montoya , who would have been an unrestricted free agent July 1 , the Canadiens now have a goalie they can expose in the June expansion draft .
Al Montoya gets an extension , and the Canadiens get a goalie they can expose in the expansion draft . Jean-Yves Ahern-USA TODAY Sports
Neither of Montreal 's minor league goalie prospects , Charlie Lindgren and Zach Fucale , are eligible per expansion draft rules . So the Canadiens needed to either find a goalie who met the requirements or extend Montoya . Canadiens star goalie Carey Price , who has a no-movement clause , is not eligible for the expansion draft , either .
All NHL teams must expose at least four players that meet requirements for the Las Vegas expansion franchise : one goalie , one defenseman and two forwards .
Ana Urushadze 's Scary Mother , Mariam Khatchvani 's Dede win top honours at Beijing film festival
The 8th Beijing International Film Festival came to a close on Sunday at the Yanqi Lake International Convention and Exhibition Center with Georgian-Estonian drama Scary Mother taking home the top honours .
According to the Hollywood Reporter , 15 films — including 13 films from overseas — were shortlisted from a total of more than 650 submissions for the Tiantan Awards .
Georgian Ana Urushadze 's feature film Scary Mother follows a 50-year-old housewife called Manana , who finally pursues their dream of writing after having previously given up on it to run their household . The film perfectly captures the dilemma of so many women who are forced to choose between family and work . Nato Murvanidze , who plays the protagonise , won Best Actress for their performance .
Fellow Georgian filmmaker Mariam Khatchvani was adjudged the Best Director for their film , Dede . When a young woman is forced to make a similarly difficult choice between an arranged marriage and true love , they rebel against and breaks free from an entrenched tradition . Konstantin Esadze won the award for best cinematography for the film .
One of the highlights of the 8th Tiantan Awards was how `` women power ' and 'films by women ' became key phrases throughout the festival . The chairperson of the award jury was the acclaimed Hong Kong director , Wong Kar-wai , who 's made such beautifully moving films like In The Mood For Love and Chungking Express . Other jurists included Chinese actor Yihong Duan and Swedish director Ruben Ostlund , who won the Palme d'Or at Cannes in 2017 for The Square .
`` Five of the 15 films this year are all about women 's power and directed by women , ” Kar-wai said at the awards ceremony before adding , “ We want more people to pay attention to women 's rights and interests , and we also want more female filmmakers to use film to write stories about women . ”
British actor Joe Cole won Best Actor for their performance in the Canadian drama Eye on Juliet .

NEW DELHI-India has given away 27,000 tickets to the opening games of the FIFA U-17 World Cup to fill empty stands , an official said Friday , in a desperate bid to avoid an embarrassing repeat of the 2010 Commonwealth Games .
The under-17 World Cup , which kicks off on Friday , marks India 's first attempt at hosting a FIFA tournament , but sales for the high-profile event have been poor , despite some seats costing less than a dollar . Organisers are now scrambling to ensure that the 56,000-capacity Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium in New Delhi appears packed when Prime Minister Narendra Modi attends the opening games which will see India play the United States .
`` We have given away 27,000 tickets to schools around the Delhi region and will also provide pick and drop facility . It will be embarrassing for us if the stadium looks empty , '' an organising committee member told AFP on condition of anonymity . The event , which runs until October 28 , has been dogged by bad news , with Greenpeace issuing a report Wednesday that said the poor quality of air in India 's pollution-clogged cities poses a `` serious health risk '' to players and spectators during the tournament . Twenty-four nations are competing in the event , which is being held in New Delhi , Mumbai , Goa , Kochi , Guwahati and Kolkata .
Greenpeace said all the six cities `` share dangerous levels of air pollution '' but singled out New Delhi as the venue with the highest risk . `` Air pollution levels during the Indian tournament could be significantly worse than during the 2008 Beijing Olympics , '' the report warned .
India 's capital will host its last game of the tournament on October 16 , just before pollution levels spike around the Diwali festival , when Hindus celebrate by setting off huge amounts of fireworks .
Media reports said matches were deliberately kept out of Delhi after October 16 because of pollution fears . India 's Supreme Court has ordered authorities to take precautions ahead of the festival , and measures under consideration include pulling some cars off roads and closing polluting industries .
World Cup organisers did not comment on the Greenpeace report . The event is among India 's highest-profile global tournaments after the Commonwealth Games in New Delhi in 2010 which were meant to showcase the country 's status as an emerging power but instead left memories of shoddy venues , empty stadiums and massive budget overruns .

I knew that folks on the Right would be up in arms when ABC cancelled Roseanne .
I 'm sophisticated enough to recognize the mental gymnastics the ill-informed would perform in order to protect their beloved Trump supporter . Their hate and ignorance goes so far that they do n't care that Roseanne Barr called a Black woman , former Obama senior advisor Valerie Jarrett , an “ ape. ” Let them tell it , despite the long , torrid and documented history of people of African descent being called apes , monkeys and subhuman is all just a figment of our imaginations .
And let these same people tell it , while Barr is just exercising their right First Amendment to speak their truth , Colin Kaepernick is a terrorist for silently protesting state violence by taking a knee during the National Anthem . Hell , they 've even gone as far as to scream that Jarret , whose doctor father could n't walk through the front doors of the Chicago hospital they worked at back in the day because of their race , is n't really Black .
But this is merely par for the course for “ free thought ” in Trump 's America .
I 'm clear that a huge crux of ya'all 's President 's followers shamelessly lacks common sense and advocates that facts just do n't matter . And since the election , I 've just accepted this to be our new reality . But the jagged little pill I 'm having an incredibly hard time swallowing is the amount of excuses and mental backflips too many white liberals are making in order to pacify these blatant and dangerous racists .
Case in point : Jimmy Kimmel .
On Wednesday ( May 30 ) , ABC 's late-night talk show host took to social media to scold us critics for not having compassion for Barr , because without an actual and official diagnosis , she 's “ mentally ill . ”
“ What @ TheRealRoseanne said is indefensible , but angrily attacking a woman who is obviously not well does no good for anyone . Please take a breath and remember that mental health issues are real . The Roseanne I know could probably use some compassion and help right now , ” they haphazardly scribbled on Twitter .

Yes , this grown man really just told Americans to temper their critiques because a grown ass 65-year-old woman , known for promoting racism , xenophobia and conspiracy theories on their social media pages , appears to be unstable .
Listen . I ca n't speak to Barr 's mental state , despite them blaming sleep aid Ambien for their bigotry , but last time I checked being “ crazy ” is n't equivalent to being racist , nor is it an excuse for it . Actually , the two have absolutely nothing to do with the other .
I also do n't care about this Roseanne they thought they knew . We are dealing and reckoning with the Roseanne that 's been this way for years . Jimmy : Where was all this concern when they had a photo shoot dressed up as a Hitler pulling cookies shaped like Jewish Holocaust victims out of an oven ?
Thankfully , those with decency seem to agree and were n't letting Kimmel get away with this silly conflating and giving those with mental illness a bad name :
What they said is indefensible but you 're going to defend them anyway ? Mental illness , if that 's what this is , does not excuse racism . It is not synonymous with racism . And critique is not attack . — roxane gay ( @ rgay ) May 30 , 2018
Mental health is not an excuse for the vile things they have and continues , even today , to retweet — Ira ( @ ira ) May 30 , 2018
Jimmy , as a mentally ill person I 'm gon na respectfully ask you not to conflate racism and entitlement with mental illness . Yes , they have struggled with their mental health but what they said is line with the things she 's been tweeting for years . Racism is a choice , not an illness . — 🏳️‍🌈Jenny `` Sloth Truther '' Trout ( @ Jenny_Trout ) May 30 , 2018

Racism is n't a mental illness it is a moral failing — Skylar Baker-Jordan ( @ SkylarJordan ) May 30 , 2018
In addition , as I tweeted earlier , let 's not forget the following question : Where 's this same compassion for Black women who have to witness being called primates ?
Boy bye . Black women being called apes need more compassion that their hateful ass . — Under Their Eye Heaux ( @ kelleent ) May 30 , 2018
Not surprisingly , when it comes to us , this collective empathy is always MIA .
Instead of trying to explain away Barr 's utter hatred , it would have been nice if Kimmel recognized the trauma we consistently encounter for being caught in the crosshairs of white supremacy on a daily basis .
It 's so damn frustrating to see folks like Barr coast off their white womanhood in order to garner sympathy for being dangerous and evil , meanwhile we do n't have that luxury . On a whim , these same women can call the police on us for innocently living our lives because our bodies are automatically read as dangerous , problematic and expendable .
Oh , the bridge called our backs .
And even in that fact , Black women are always expected to be graceful in our response to the staunch oppression and disrespect we face . For example , when Jarret was on MSNBC 's recent “ Everyday Racism in America ” special , they were the stoic pillar of what we 're told we need to be : Strong , unaffected and indestructible .
They stressed that Barr 's tweets were “ a teachable moment ” and that they were “ fine . ”
“ I think we have to turn it into a teaching moment . I 'm fine . I 'm worried about all the people out there who do n't have a circle of friends and followers who come right to their defense—the person who 's walking down the street minding their own business and they see somebody cling to their purse or want to cross the street . Or every black parent I know who has a boy who has to sit down and have a conversation— “ the talk , ” as we call it . As you say , those ordinary examples of racism that happen every single day . And I think that 's why I 'm so glad to be here this evening talking with all of you . ”
JARRETT SAYS ROSEANNE TWEET `` SHOULD BE A TEACHING MOMENT '' : Former Obama advisor Valerie Jarrett responded to Barr 's racist tweet about her , saying she 's fine but worries about those who do n't `` have a circle of friends and followers coming to their defense . '' The co-hosts react . pic.twitter.com/U6oMDwpx6n — The View ( @ TheView ) May 30 , 2018
Of course , I applaud Jarrett for exerting such decorum—cause their critics sure as hell wo n't .
But I 'm also sick of Black woman having to be the pillar of social graces when we 're under attack . Regardless of what our queen Michelle Obama says , when folks like Barr go low–and Kimmel tries to rationalize that deplorable behavior–I do n't want to go high . I just want to knee these jokers in the face .
What 's so wrong with that ?

The second period for selling fireworks in the state started Sunday and will run through January third . A variety of retailers opened shops and many set up multiple temporary locations to take advantage of the first sales period that started in June and ran through July 8th .
State Fire Marshal , Dan Wood , says one change cuts out the vendors who set up temporary locations this summer . “ This season the only places that can sell fireworks are the permanent locations , meaning the permanent buildings — so no tents are allowed during the sales period , ” Wood says . They say those vendors who got a license to sell during the summer period can also sell now .
Wood says there is no extra fee for this season and says the only issue would be if they made any changes to their businesses , as they would have to resubmit their site plans . If there are no sit changes , they can open up and sell fireworks . Wood says they did have several large stores that got exemptions to set up small displays to sell within their stores , but it does n't look like many will be doing that this time .
“ So if you take the exempt amount ones out and you just go with the true permanent stand-alone ones — we had 30 some in the June-July period — and for this sales period here in December and January , we have around 20 that we know of right now , ” according to Wood . The summer period was the first time fireworks sales had been legal in the state since 1938 and there was a scramble to get everyone licensed and the rules in place . Wood is enjoying a little calmer sales period this time around .
They describe it as “ a bit less hectic , ” and says while they 've had a few new plans submitted , they are just our trying to get all the retail locations inspected . The law allows city councils and county boards of supervisors to ban or restrict use of fireworks , but not their sale . The second season is designed to allow you to use fireworks to celebrate the New Year . Wood does n't know how many people will want to be out in the cold using fireworks .
“ We really do n't . We just ask people to do it in a safe manner just like they did in June and July — we still had some incidents — but we just ask everybody to do it safely , ” Wood says .
Many cities put restrictions on when the fireworks could be shot off in the summer period and are doing the same this time around . Some cities revisited the restrictions after finding many people ignored them or did n't follow the restrictions .
Michael Brantley continues to make progress in their recovery from an ankle injury and could be in the lineup in left field when the ALDS shifts from Cleveland to New York on Sunday .
Indians manager Terry Francona said he 'll know for sure after Brantley tests the ankle in a 4 p.m. workout Saturday at Yankee Stadium .
`` I think he 's getting to that point , '' Francona said .
A return to the lineup by Brantley , a two-time All-Star , would be a big lift for the Indians , who will try to go up 2-0 in the series Friday behind ace Corey Kluber .
Brantley , who missed 50 games over the final two months with the injury , is available off the bench in Game 2 .
`` He helps us win , '' Francona said of Brantley , who missed Cleveland 's run to the World Series last year following two shoulder surgeries . `` I 'm excited for them because last year they missed out . This year , with a lot of hard work , he 's now going to be a part of what we 're doing . I know it will mean a lot to him , and because of that , it means a lot to us . ''

In this file photo , second-place finisher Emily Sweeney , of the United States , celebrates as they slide to the finish after a womens World Cup Luge sprint event in Park City , Utah . For whatever reason , sliding sports have always gotten tons of attention from the military , and the team that is wearing red , white and blue in Korea has plenty of people who wear the flag at work as well . Sweeney is in the Army . Rick Bowmer  The Associated Press file
LAKE PLACID , N.Y. > > U.S. Olympic bobsledder Nate Weber will never forget the sound .
They were going through a brutal outdoor summertime workout last year and was starting a series of outdoor sprints , when an extremely loud noise got their attention . Then came another noise , louder than the first . And another , louder yet again .
My heart started racing ,  Weber said . And then I realized , I might want to run pretty fast right now.
This was no typical workout : It was on an Army base in Afghanistan , the noises were coming from mortars getting shot down only a few yards from where they were standing , and Weber wound up getting hit in the arms and face by small pieces of red-hot debris falling from the sky .

They wasnt seriously injured . They also finished their sprints .
At the Olympics , Weber will be representing red , white , blue and green . Hes a Sergeant First Class in the U.S. Army , and a green beret . And hes one of seven Army soldiers who will be sliding for the U.S. at the Pyeongchang Games that start next week , wearing the American flag in a foreign land  with the same level of pride that the 10th Special Forces member has during their three deployments abroad .
Its a different kind of adrenalin ,  Weber said . The stakes are a little bit higher if Im with my special forces group , but the atmosphere is very similar in that youre a team and that youre there for the guy on your left and right . That transition is really easy to make.
Hes not alone . Besides the seven American soldiers competing on the track at the Alpensia Sliding Center in Pyeongchang  Weber is joined by fellow bobsledders Justin Olsen , Chris Fogt , and Nick Cunningham . USA Luges Olympic roster includes Army Sergeants Emily Sweeney , Taylor Morris and Matt Mortensen  but several coaches on the U.S. side have military backgrounds as well .
Some are part of the Armys World Class Athlete Program , which was formed in 1997 and has been represented on most U.S. Olympic teams since .
Its a really special thing ,  Sweeney said . Were really excited to represent the military and our sport and our country all at once , especially at the Olympics , such a big stage . Im really excited to see what we can do . Its a community within a community , where we have a lot of support for each other.
Weber will be returning to their special forces unit about a week after the Olympics to get caught up on their real work . This could be the final Olympics for Fogt , whose military responsibilities are likely to be increasing soon since a promotion is likely . Sweeney said their push toward really getting physically and mentally ready for this four-year Olympic cycle came when they had to report for their scheduled duty not long after missing the 2014 Sochi Games .
For whatever reason , soldiers make great sliders .
Its about the teamwork thats required ,  Fogt said . In the Army , you have to be part of a team from your very first day of basic training . On top of that , weve been through worse situations . When youre bobsledding and its minus-20 degrees on the hill and its snowin and blowin , you remember youve been on the field without meals in this kind of weather , hanging out in a foxhole . So that mental toughness helps us a lot.
Cunningham was a slider before they were a soldier . After hearing about the Army WCAP program from teammates and seeing the level of support those sliders were getting from the military , they signed up after competing in the 2010 Olympics . Through the GI Bill , they got their masters degree in sports administration as they pursue life after sliding .
We talk about the team behind the team ,  Cunningham said . They really are the team behind the team.
All seven of the U.S. sliding soldiers know how to win , too .
Olsen is an Olympic gold medalist , having been part of the four-man bobsled that was driven to victory at the 2010 Vancouver Games by the late Steven Holcomb  who also served in the military . Fogt won a bronze with Holcomb at the 2014 Sochi Games . Cunningham , Weber , Sweeney , Morris and Mortensen all won medals on the World Cup circuit this season .
Getting to the Olympics is obviously a big deal for all 242 members of the U.S. team thats headed to Pyeongchang . With the soldiers , the extra significance is also clear .
For me , getting named to the team wasnt the goal ,  Weber said . The goal was to go over there and win some medals.

Mark Phillips , 36 , appeared in a St. Thomas court Monday morning via video from the Elgin Middlesex Detention Centre . A publication ban has been put in place that prevents the reporting of what was discussed in court but their next court appearance was set for Friday , Dec. 15 .
Phillips is facing one count of aggravated assault and three counts of assault with a weapon .
The confrontation outside of the Elgin Mall last Thursday , caught partly on camera , shows a man getting out of a white BMW brandishing a baseball bat , repeatedly yelling “ terrorists ” and “ ISIS , ” while a person off-camera can be heard telling them to “ stay away. ” A 52-year-old man suffered bruising and a cracked rib .

St. Thomas police say they were called to the scene around 4:30 p.m. Thursday after reports of a man attacking another man with a baseball bat . The suspect had already fled in their car but was arrested in south London that same evening .
When asked if police were investigating the assault as a hate crime , St. Thomas police Sgt . Brian Carnegie previously told 980 CFPL they believe the suspect was racially motivated .
“ That 's why we 've called in the criminal investigation branch , if it borders the hate crime line then they are the ones to deal with those kinds of situations . ”
Summerville police say the alleged “ Snapchat ” school shooting threat which has been shared on social media in the last 24 hours is not credible .
Police spokesperson Lt. Nick Santanna said the incident appears to have stemmed from multiple unsubstantiated rumors .
The alleged threat was directed toward Summerville High School .
The Dorchester District 2 school district and principal were made aware and worked with police to investigate the threat , releasing the following statement :
`` Late last night , the Summerville Police Department was notified of a disturbing social media post involving Summerville High School and an incident that could possibly occur next week . The police department , working with the school district , immediately began investigating and will continue to investigate the origin of the post as well as the credibility . ”
“ The Summerville Police Department appreciates the numerous amounts of messages we received alerting us to this incident , ” Santanna said in a statement Friday afternoon .
While no charges have been made , many people want someone to be held accountable .
“ I think they should be punished because it causes anxiety for everybody , ” said Shirley , who has two granddaughters who attended Summerville High .
The Snapchat image of the threat was shared all over social media . The screenshot included language that someone is going to `` shoot up '' the school and , `` If you go to Summerville High School , a kid has warned others not to go to school on Monday- I do not suggest you go at all - the principal is warned but screenshot this and tell those at Summerville . ''
“ I 'm anxious because I still want them to come to school because I feel like they 'll just change the day of the threat , ” Shirley said .
“ [ I 'm ] not really [ nervous ] because… it just does n't seem like it could happen . ”
“ As a parent , you get concerned when you hear about these things , ” added Michael Dominguez , a father to a SHS student . “ This is a real thing and people are shooting up schools . ”
Dominguez is one of the hundreds of parents and students who tried to spread the word on social media about the threat after their daughter showed them the image .
“ My daughter texted me did you see this ? ” they said . “ I said do n't send it to anybody , do n't share it , I do n't want you getting involved . I 'll take care of it . ”
A statement from the district said they immediately started investigating the origin of the post as well as its credibility , going on to say they will take “ every precaution to provide a safe learning environment ” .
“ I 'm not gon na give somebody the thought that if they keep threatening the schools , then all of the kids will stay at home , ” Shirley said . “ That 's not the answer . ”
In a statement Friday afternoon Raynor said police will continue to look into the motives of the false postings , and out of precaution , there will be added security on campus Monday .
Santanna said the department also investigated a threat toward Summerville High School in May of this year . That threat also turned out to be not credible .

Source : Has Mugabe lost control ? – NewsDay Zimbabwe April 17 , 2017
IT could be poetic truth that indeed the centre can no longer hold .
NEWSDAY COMMENT
With the events happening in Zanu PF , has President Robert Mugabe lost control of the governing party ?
That Zanu PF apparatchiks have taken to openly attacking each other violently and now need their intervention even at the lowest level is symptomatic of a political system that has lost its hold on the levers of power .
Opposition parties have persistently accused Zanu PF of fanning inter-party violence that continues to blight our country 's electoral processes in particular .
Yet , the President , has denied these as the wailings of a tactless and spineless opposition .
Now the chickens have come home to roost . Last week , we reported that violence had broken out in Mashonaland East 's Mahusekwa district over Marondera West constituency .
Now it has come to Harare , a few hundred metres from the government seat of power .
Many activists were left with gapping wounds and their pictures have gone viral on social media but nobody has been arrested . If the Zanu PF thugs had been involved in a confrontation with opposition party members then it would have been easy to arrest members of the other side .
Now the police have been left powerless .
Who do they arrest in this situation of a violent intra-party altercation that is threatening to engulf the whole country ? On the other hand Mashonaland Central is reaching boiling point and needed a presidential decree of some sort to stop the warring factions .
Are these the final bolts and nuts on Mugabe 's legacy that they have decided to bestow upon this country ? We are sure this is not how the Zanu PF leader dreamt the final chapter in their over half a century of political activity .
Cde President , no doubt you are a master of your own legacy . You could reproduce the script into a fairy-tale of unmatched proportions by just the stroke of a pen or a word .
In the year or so that is left before the coming general elections , Mugabe could create the necessary political , legal and moral structures to ensure a peaceful country and elections .
They are not brain dead as some would think , and their intelligence is unquestionable . But has Mugabe become so blinded by power that they do not realise the importance of a peaceful transition that they can preside over .
It is open to all that the fights within the Zanu PF party are succession-induced , and they have shut their eyes and ears to all this and continues as if it is business as usual .
Is there need for loss of human life so the President can have another stab at power ?
No doubt , Mugabe can take a look in the mirror and their age .
We call on the President to make the right call and repose on our country a peaceful future .
The ball is in their court .

MEXICO CITY ( Reuters ) - U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson warned Mexico on Friday to pay attention to Russian meddling in elections around the world , following comments from another U.S. official that there were signs of such interference in the country 's presidential race .
Speaking in Mexico City , Tillerson said European counterparts had noticed that Russia had had its fingerprints on a number of elections .
“ We hear this from our European counterparts , ” Tillerson said . “ My advice would be ... pay attention to what 's happening . ”
Their comments followed remarks late last year by U.S. National Security Adviser H.R . McMaster , who said there was already evidence of Russian meddling in Mexican elections set for July .
McMaster did not give details of the alleged interference .
Tillerson made no reference to alleged Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election won by President Donald Trump . That involvement included people in Russia buying 3,000 U.S. political ads and placing 80,000 Facebook posts seen by 126 million Americans over two years , Facebook has said .
U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller is investigating the allegations of Russian meddling in the U.S. campaign , including whether there was any collusion between Trump 's team and Moscow .
Russia denies that it intervened in the election .
The country led by Vladimir Putin has also been accused of intervening in votes in Italy , Finland , Britain and France , among others .
Mexico holds presidential and congressional elections on July 1 and so far the frontrunner in almost all polls is left-wing former Mexico City Mayor Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador .
An aide to presidential hopeful Jose Antonio Meade , hoping to run for the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party ( PRI ) , warned in January that Russia could try to benefit Lopez Obrador .
Lopez Obrador has made light of the allegation and has since taken to wearing a jacket embroidered with the name “ Andres Manuelovich ” .

Children of obese parents may be at risk for developmental delays , according to a study by researchers at the National Institutes of Health . The investigators found that children of obese mothers were more likely to fail tests of fine motor skill–the ability to control movement of small muscles , such as those in the fingers and hands . Children of obese fathers were more likely to fail measures of social competence , and those born to extremely obese couples also were more likely to fail tests of problem-solving ability .
The study , appearing in Pediatrics , was conducted by scientists at the NIH 's Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development ( NICHD ) .
“ The previous U.S. studies in this area have focused on the mothers ' pre- and post-pregnancy weight , ” said the study 's first author , Edwina Yeung , Ph.D. , an investigator in NICHD 's Division of Intramural Population Health Research . “ Our study is one of the few that also includes information about fathers , and our results suggest that dad 's weight also has significant influence on child development . ”
Dr. Yeung and their coauthors cited research indicating that about 1 in 5 pregnant women in the United States is overweight or obese .
In the study , authors reviewed data collected from the Upstate KIDS study , which originally sought to determine if fertility treatments could affect child development from birth through age 3 . More than 5,000 women enrolled in the study roughly 4 months after giving birth in New York State ( excluding New York City ) between 2008 and 2010 . To assess development , parents completed the Ages and Stages Questionnaire after performing a series of activities with their children . The test is n't used to diagnose specific disabilities , but serves as a screen for potential problems , so that children can be referred for further testing .
Children in the study were tested at 4 months of age and retested 6 more times through age 3 . When they enrolled , mothers also provided information on their health and weight–before and after pregnancy–and the weight of their partners .
Compared to children of normal weight mothers , children of obese mothers were nearly 70 percent more likely to have failed the test indicator on fine motor skill by age 3 . Children of obese fathers were 75 percent more likely to fail the test 's personal-social domain–an indicator of how well they were able to relate to and interact with others by age 3 . Children with two obese parents were nearly three times more likely to fail the test 's problem-solving section by age 3 .
It is not known why parental obesity might increase children 's risk for developmental delay . The authors note that animal studies indicate that obesity during pregnancy may promote inflammation , which could affect the fetal brain . Less information is available on the potential effects of paternal obesity on child development . The authors added that some studies have indicated that obesity could affect the expression of genes in sperm .
If the link between parental obesity and developmental delays is confirmed , the authors wrote , physicians may need to take parental weight into account when screening young children for delays and early interventional services .

New Delhi : Defending champion PV Sindhu stood just one step away from retaining their title after defeating Thailand 's Ratchanok Inthanon in a lop-sided semi-final at the $ 350,000 India Open Super 500 tournament on Saturday .
Sindhu dished out an aggressive game to outwit World No 3 Ratchanok 21-13 , 21-15 in the second semi-final which ended an hour before midnight at the Siri Fort Sports Complex . The Olympic silver medallist will face World No 11 American Beiwen Zhang in the finals on Sunday .
Indian mixed doubles a pair of Pranaav Jerry Chopra and N Sikki Reddy , who had reached the semi-finals of the Japan Open last year , went down 16-21 , 19-21 against the fifth seeded Danish pair of Mathias Christiansen and Christinna Pedersen in a semi-final match , which saw the Indian duo winning four video referrals .
Mathias and Christinna had combined at the Denmark Open for the first time and it is their third finals of a major event after having finished runners-up at China Open Superseries Premier and Hong Kong Open Superseries last year .
Disappointed to end on the losing side , Pranaav said , `` We are not satisfied with the performance today . We want to finish at the podium but overall it was a good tournament . We will carry the momentum in the next tournaments . ''
`` We would be playing at ABC next week but as a pair our next tournaments would be German Open and All England Championship , '' added Sikki , one half of the eighth seeded Indian combo .
Asked about the video referrals , Sikki said , `` I could see the shuttle clearly . Good that it was a TV court so it helped or else we would have lost those points . ''
In the much-awaited semi-final , Sindhu engaged their rival in fast-paced rallies , producing some acute-angled returns and better reach to dominate the proceedings .
It seemed like a lop-sided affair as Sindhu soon grabbed a 11-3 advantage at the lemon break after reeling off 10 straight points from 1-3 .
Ratchanok seemed to struggle with their returns as most of their shots went wide and long or ended up at the net . Sindhu , however , looked sharp and entered the break after pushing the shuttle at the back of the court .
Ratchanok tried to make a comeback and won a few points to make it 8-14 but Sindhu started dominating the rallies again to move to 16-9 .
At 12-18 , Ratchanok found the net twice to hand over eight game points to Sindhu .
The Thai ace saved one before they again netted their return to hand the first game to the Indian .
In the second game , the duo could n't be separated in the first 12 points as they moved neck-and-neck till 6-6 , before Sindhu moved ahead using their drops and powerful smash and also aided by Ratchanok 's miscued strokes to lead 11-7 .
After the interval , Ratchanok narrowed the deficit to 10 -12 and then 11-13 but Sindhu seemed always a step ahead . They anticipated the shots well and soon surged to 16-13 when Ratchanok went wide again .
Ratchanok continued to struggle with their returns and in the end it was a tight net return by Sindhu which took them to five match point and they converted it when the Thai again went long .
Among others , World No 11 American Beiwen Zhang entered the finals after edging out Hong Kong 's sixth seeded Cheung Ngan Yi of Hong Kong 14-21 , 21-12 , 21-19 in the first women 's singles semi-finals .
All England Championships finalist Shi Yuqi of China set up an exciting men 's singles summit clash with World no 7 Taiwanese Chou Tien Chen , who had also reached the finals last year at India Open Super Series .
In the first semi-finals , third seed Chen notched up a hard-fought 23-21 , 21-16 win over China 's Qiao Bin , who is a winner of 2016 Korea Open .
Yuqi then survived a tough battle against Iskandar Zulkarnain , prevailing 18-21 , 21-10 , 21-19 over the Malaysian qualifier in a pulsating contest .
Olympic silver medallists and top seeds Kamilla Rytter Juhl and Christinna Pedersen were stunned by third seeds Indonesian pair of Greysia Polii and Apriyani Rahayu 21-14 , 19-21 , 21-18 early in the day .
It was an exciting match as Pranaav and Sikki took on fast-rising pair of Mathias and Christinna . The Danish combo zoomed to a 8-3 lead but the Indian duo narrowed the deficit to 9-11 at the breather .
After the interval , Sikki 's return found their rivals napping as they clawed back at 12-12 . However , Mathias and Christinna managed to move to a 19-15 lead before sealing the opening game when Pranaav 's return went to net .
Both the pairs started the second game on an even knell as they split the initial 10 points before Mathias and Christinna entered the break at 11-8 after Mathias produced a tap at the net .
The Indian pair kept breathing down their rivals neck , moving 10-12 and 12-13 before Sikki unleashed a smash to level par . Mathias and Christinna moved ahead again before India won a video referral to make it 15-15 .
They moved together till 18-18 before Pranaav made a service error and then their return got buried at the net as the Danish duo had two match points . Mathais and Christinna hit out next before Pranaav again sent the shuttle out to end their campaign .

It 's that same thought that carried them through one of the hardest conversations .
`` Another police officer came and that 's what made me think something 's wrong , '' Singleton-Melvin said .
They say that feeling they felt this is hard to explain , but says they know where it came from .
`` I had a feeling that they were gone ... and I ca n't say it was a good feeling but it was a relief because I knew they were with God . That God had taken their home , '' Singleton-Melvin said .
As candles glow outside of Singleton 's room their family is holding onto that relief but wo n't find peace until justice is served .
`` We want to know what happened . Them memory lives on . I will never forget my child . That 's a part of me . I 'll never forget her , '' Singleton-Melvin said .
Making a promise they say wo n't be broken .
`` Promise them there will be answers . Yes , I promise them . If it 's the last thing I do , '' Singleton-Melvin said .

Finding motivation to get regular exercise requires an evolving strategy and the help of other people , at least for me . What worked great for me last month might not work at all this week .
Our challenge at every stage of life is to work with what we 've got . That means the ongoing changes of menopause , plus a nagging pain in one hip and my lower back , and allergies , currently . If I wait until I feel perfectly , I could maybe squeeze in a workout or two a year .
At the beginning of this journey , I noted that it is easier for me to show up for a commitment to someone else than it is to keep that promise to myself . This has always bugged me , but I 'm over it . Who cares ? If it is easier for me to get exercise if I have a workout buddy , then I need to get some workout buddies and quit beating myself up over some impossibly perfect ideal in my head . And it goes both ways , so it 's not like I 'm just mooching off someone 's motivation when I have none of my own . It 's a two-way street and we both benefit .
I 've got a couple of grandsons , and here is one insanely hard workout if you 're interested . This works with both my older and younger grandcritters , or best of all , the three of us together . Start out by gathering weights , toys like jump rope and resistance bands , bottles of water and towels to mop up the sweat . You take turns coming up with exercises : So maybe grandma says 10 push-ups , then grandkid says 20 mountain climbers ( or invents some crazy move with no name ) . By taking turns , you do n't know what 's coming next . Set a timer for an hour and play with the kids , and I guarantee they will work you out . This works great also with what we like to call crazy dancing : Each of you in turn makes up a dance move and then the others copy it . Ever tried to copy the dance moves of a six-year-old ? Believe me when I tell you it 's a serious workout .
I also really enjoy playing basketball , and am I thinking about starting a weekly game in Edgewood—if anybody is interested , get in touch with me and let 's see if we can pull something regular together to run around the court and shoot some baskets . When I say “ game ” I exaggerate somewhat . I like to fool around but do n't ask me to keep score or to always remember to dribble or keep track of whose team I 'm on . ( My favorite thing is a win-win , which is not always practical in sports . ) For me , it 's all about supporting each other in exercise and having some fun at the same time .
You know how they say park your car at the far end of the parking lot so you get some steps in when you go grocery shopping ? That also applies to going to an event like the Earth Day Festival at La Montañita in Albuquerque over the weekend , when we had to park about a half a mile away and up a very steep hill . I 'm still sore , and the look my daughter gave me when I jokingly suggested they go pick up the car and come get me was priceless .
But that experience really got to the nub of all this for me perfectly .
This has been a rough winter and spring for me in terms of working out . I 've struggled with cigarette addiction and smoked way too many of them . I 've had allergies and the flu . Blah blah blah . What happens when you do that is lost ground . So as we were walking up that wicked hill yesterday , and sitting to take a break in the middle ( where I cracked my joke ) I 'm thinking that I feel like my grandmother . My hip hurts , my back hurts . It would be easier to ride in a car than hike up that hill .
But sitting in a car up hills ( and all day at work every day ) is why I feel like this in the first place , right ? And I do n't know how you feel , but I want to be the super cool grandmother who can lift weights , dance until I drop , go rock climbing and paddle boarding , play sports with my grandsons , and hike up steep hills . Physical fitness is a use-it-or-lose-it proposition no matter what age and what level of fitness a person is .
So my ever-evolving new plan is this : Whatever works ! A few workout buddies , planning some regular stuff like basketball , and going with the flow when an opportunity for exercise presents itself are all better options than sitting on a bench hoping to be rescued from walking . No matter how steep the hill .

Cardi B got their husband Offset out of a motoring ticket earlier this week after they FaceTimed the police officer and agreed to have their picture with him .
The 'Bodak Yellow ' hitmaker intervened when the Migos rapper was stopped by cops on Monday ( 02.07.18 ) by speaking to the police officer via video message and helping to diffuse the situation .
Taking to their Twitter account , the 26-year-old rapper said : `` W H E N G O D S H O W S Y O U N O B I T C H C O M P A R E S ! ! ! ! ! ! ! Just got let go on a pull over for a FaceTime pic with my wife ( SHES THE BEST ) ( sic ) . ''
This is n't the first time the 25-year-old beauty has stuck up for their husband - whom they secretly married last year - when it comes to problems on the road as they took to their Twitter account last month to confirm that Offset had been involved in a car crash in Atlanta but insisted it was n't their fault because there was a `` crackhead '' on the road .
Gadchiroli : The security forces have recovered at least 15 more bodies of Maoists from the Indravati River in Gadchiroli early on Tuesday , taking the toll in the gunfight in the past 48 hours to 37 , official sources said .
A fresh gun-fight on Monday night left at least six Maoists dead , barely 36 hours after Sunday 's encounter which had resulted in the killing of 16 rebels .
The bodies , which were bloated and had started to decompose , were found floating in the river which flows along the Maharashtra-Chhattisgarh border .
These 15 Maoists are said to be from among those who managed to escape into the forests during Sunday 's encounter . They must have succumbed to their injuries , an official , who declined to be identified , told IANS .
The second encounter took place in Rajaram Kahnhila village in Jimlagatta with commandos of the C-60 force taking on the rebels .
A high-ranking commander of the Aheri Dalam , identified as Nandu , is among those killed .
Officials said that the Sironcha and Perimeli dalams have been totally wiped out in the two-day long operations .
Jimlagatta is 60 km from the scene of Sunday 's ambush in which 16 Maoists were killed , including three of their high-ranking commanders and seven women .
Maharashtra 's Additional Director-General of Police ( L & O ) Bipin Bihari said that so far the C-60 commando forces have eliminated three Maoist dalam commanders .
In the separate encounters on Sunday and Monday , a total of 19 women and 18 male Maoists have been gunned down , but the toll is expected to rise .
Till now , the police have recovered a sophisticated cache of arms , including two AK-47s , two INSAS , three SLRs , three .303s , one 58-mm gun , eight 12 bore rifles , a musket , pittus and detonators , besides Naxal literature from these operations , Bihari added .
Search and combing operations continue , though interrupted by heavy rain and bad weather , in the entire Gadchiroli district .
The district is among the worst affected by the Maoist insurgency . It has been virtually sealed off by the security forces , as they stalked in the jungles , villages , hills and valleys to snuff out the Reds in their deep hideouts .
Other Maoist-affected states — Madhya Pradesh , Chhattisgarh , Odisha , Jharkhand , Andhra Pradesh , Telangana — are on a state of high alert ever since the state security forces here launched their biggest anti-Maoist operations in around four decades .
The Oisín McGrath Foundation is looking forward to its third annual ‘ Run for Oisín ' , one of the biggest fun runs in the district . The 5k and 10k walk , run or jog will take place 1pm on Sunday 15th October in Belcoo .
The Oisín McGrath Foundation was formed in memory of 13-year-old Oisín McGrath from Belcoo , who lost their lives tragically in February 2015 . The Foundation is inspired by Oisín 's life and formed both to keep their spirit alive and to inspire others through their memory .
The Run for Oisín event is licensed by Athletics NI , chip-timed and professionally measured with medals for all participants . Refreshments and prize giving will take place in the Community Centre at the finish line .
Entry fee for 10k is £12 , 5k £8 and 5k U16 £5 . Registration will be open on the day at Lakeland Community Care from 10am or you can pre-register online via www.athleticsni.org . For anyone wishing to support or keep up to date with the event please visit the Oisín McGrath Foundation Facebook page .
Oisín 's mum Sharon McGrath commented “ Run for Oisín once again promises to be a fun filled event for recreational runners and walkers as well as a challenging and rewarding experience for seasoned athletes . We are hoping for another successful event this year with as many people as possible returning to Run for Oisín and to remember him . We are forever grateful for the support we have received and could never have anticipated the response last year . It was a huge family and community event with over 1000 participants and we look forward to welcoming everyone back again . ”
Administered by the Fermanagh Trust , the Oisín McGrath Foundation provides financial support to young people who demonstrate exceptional commitment and/ or ability to the world of sport but may be held back by their financial situation from pursing their goals . The fund is currently open for applications . For more information visit www.fermanaghtrust.org

Hip-hop veteran Cut Chemist has just announced their first album in 12 years . It 's titled Die Cut and expected to hit shelves sometime next year .
The follow-up to 2006 's The Audience 's Listening serves as the rapper 's second full-length overall but follows a long line of remixes , collaborations , and DJ mixes ; in particular , Cut Chemist has put out a couple of projects alongside DJ Shadow ( The Hard Sell ) and , most recently , they remixed Roots Manuva in 2010 . Additionally , the man behind the Cut Chemist moniker , Lucas MacFadden , has also continued their work as part of hip-hop collective Jurassic 5 and Latin funk outfit Ozomatli .
According to the MC , this 17-track comeback album also serves as something of a rebirth . “ This is the death of a musical identity and the birth of another , ” they note in a press statement . “ It is n't just the cut-and-paste style anymore . I 'm collaborating with more musicians and sampling less . This is different . The content is emotionally heavier , even though it 's still fun . It harks back to the energy you can share with live musicians rather than being a DJ alone on stage . I wanted to capture that with this style of music . ”
While a tracklist and release date for Die Cut are still under wraps , we do know it will include a handful of special guests : Deantoni Parks ( The Mars Volta ) , Biz Markie , actor Erika Christensen ( Parenthood ) , and tUnE-yArDs , among others . As a preview of one of these collaborations , Cut Chemist has shared new song “ Work My Mind ” featuring Chali 2na and Hymnal . Take a listen below .

Through the columns of your esteemed newspaper , I would like to invite the attention of higher authorities and the city security authorities to this issue as it has been 10 days that in my area many of the people have complained about this . As this issue is very rampant in Karachi , many of us try to avoid taking our cell phones with us while walking on streets .
Recently , a relative of mine was beaten up by robbers and their cell phone was snatched on their way to the bakery . It was a terrible incident that really shook all of us a lot , but especially me personally . I would n't wish this to happen again to anyone else . We , the citizens of Karachi , ought to be able to walk freely without the fear of facing such problems . It is really miserable that we have to face such issues either it is day time or night . It is affecting people psychologically ; the trauma of going through a mobile-snatching incident leads toward a feeling of insecurity .

MUMBAI , Feb 2 ( Thomson Reuters Foundation ) - Tens of thousands of people migrating to Indian cities each day can not find adequate housing , as rental markets shrink despite millions of homes remaining vacant , government data shows .
The share of rental housing in cities has fallen by nearly half over the past five decades , according to the government 's annual economic survey released this week .
Rent control , unclear property rights , and a focus on building homes for ownership rather than renting are at the root of the problem , it said .
“ Policies related to housing need to recognise that India has an increasingly fluid population ( and ) that across the income spectrum , rental housing is an important foothold into a city for new arrivals , ” the survey said .
A quarter of India 's urban population lives in informal housing , including slums , due to the critical shortage of affordable accommodation , according to the social consultancy firm FSG in Mumbai .
That number is likely to increase with migration from the countryside to cities , as people seek better job prospects .
A government plan to provide housing for all by 2022 is meant to create 20 million new urban housing units and 30 million rural homes .
But most states are behind target , and analysts say the programme will not solve homelessness .
Finalising the national urban rental housing policy may help resolve the issue , as the current draft offers more protection from hostile tenants and gives them more incentive to rent , said Anuj Puri , chairperson of ANAROCK Property Consultants .
“ The lack of a clear regulatory framework has resulted in many house owners preferring to keep their houses vacant rather than renting them out , ” Puri told the Thomson Reuters Foundation .
The share of rental housing in Indian cities declined to 28 percent in 2011 from 54 percent in 1961 , according to the economic survey .
At the same time , the number of vacant homes in cities rose to 11.1 million in 2011 from 6.5 million a decade earlier . Vacant houses make up more than 12 percent of total urban housing stock .
The financial hub of Mumbai , where more than half the population lives in slums and informal settlements , has nearly half a million vacant homes , survey data showed .
“ The fact that such a large number of houses continue to be vacant is not just ironical , but reflects a serious policy failure , ” said Shivani Chaudhry , executive director of the New Delhi-based advocacy group Housing and Land Rights Network .
The government must prioritise “ social rental housing , tax vacant properties , and control real estate speculation , ” they said . ( Reporting by Rina Chandran @ rinachandran .

* SAYS APPROVED RAISING OF FUNDS VIA ISSUE OF 400 MILLION SHARES THROUGH QIP

NASHVILLE — Woodi Washington is a Top 50 prospect with more than 20 offers , but the 4-star corner from Oakland ( Tenn. ) High currently claims no leaders in their recruitment .
That could change soon , though .
After impressing at the water-logged Nike Opening Regional in Nashville on Sunday , the local 2019 standout told VolQuest that they plan on taking a few spring official visits and hopes to come to a decision sometime before their senior season .
Ohio State , Oklahoma and Arkansas are slated for OVs from the 4-star corner , with in-state Tennessee a key factor in Washington 's recruitment , too .
“ They want me a lot , ” Washington said of the Vols .
“ I 'm a priority . They told me I can play early . I have that chance . That 'd be great . ”
Washington visited Notre Dame for the first time last weekend before returning to Nashville for the Nike camp . In a torrential downpour , the 5-foot-11 , 178-pound defensive back showcased their competitiveness Sunday , regularly jumping to the front of the line in 1-on-1s to compete against an impressive collection of blue-chip receivers . Washington displayed their savvy footwork and athleticism , coming up with a couple PBUs during the drill .
“ I felt like I did a great job today , considering ( the weather ) . I could n't really feel the wet once I started to get going . It was cold but I just went out there , ” they said .
“ I feel like I got better competing with all those receivers from different states , different areas . ”
Washington visited Tennessee with their family in early March and he 's developed a good relationship with new corner 's coach Terry Fair . Defensive coordinator Kevin Sherrer also went by Washington 's school last week , making sure the prospect knows that UT is working hard to keep them in the Volunteer State .
“ We have a great relationship , ” Washington said of Fair .
“ He calls or texts me just about everyday . They try to get me down there every once in a while just to hang out and connect . They want me a lot . ”
SPOILER ALERT : Do not read if you have not yet watched “ After , ” the seventh episode of the second season of “ The Handmaid 's Tale . ”
Yvonne Strahovski 's character in “ The Handmaid 's Tale ” might be named Serena Joy , but there is very little in their Gilead life that is actually joyful .
Although the actor admits that Serena has it better than most women in the new , dystopian society , they have still been stripped of the voice , passion , and power they had in their regular life , years before . With their husband Commander Fred Waterford ( Joseph Fiennes ) stuck in the hospital , being treated for injuries sustained post-handmaid suicide bombing , Serena is reclaiming a little bit of their past self — though in secret .
Acting as Fred , they drafted new security orders — and even enlisted June/Offred 's ( Elisabeth Moss ) help in the project . On the one hand , their actions cement their strength by looking to the rest of the world like he 's still capable of doing their job , but on the other , they exemplify their own ability to make tough decisions in a time of need . And what at first glance seemed like it may have just been a test for their handmaid turned out to be a genuine olive branch .
“ She really does need somebody , ” Strahovski tells Variety of Serena . “ Any human , when you 're in such isolation from humanity , [ would ] . Ultimately the goal is to get the household back together because without Fred , God knows what would happen to Serena…but they are trying to be a bit more friendly with Offred . ”
Here , Strahovski talks with Variety about Serena and Fred 's pre-Gilead relationship , Serena 's new power play , and whether or not they personally find hope in the story the way Serena finds hope in June 's baby .
How did learning Serena and Fred 's backstory — that they were once very supportive of their work and at times even the driving force for them to use their voice — affect what you had previously worked out in your mind about their relationship ?
It 's always weird to get their backstory . It almost feels like we 're shooting a completely different [ project ] in a way when we go back in time and we wear normal clothes . I think their relationship was far more normal . I think there was a genuine sense of love between them — and passion and respect . I think Fred recognized in Serena that they were a very capable , incredible woman who was passionate about something and able to be a spokesperson and able to articulate herself . And they were smart , so I think they encouraged them and pushed them out into the limelight to be that spokesperson that they recognized — and admired — in them There was much more of a back and forth between them . Serena could run the show and could talk back to them and shut them down when they were suggesting things . Obviously that 's incredibly different now , which is partly why you see such bitterness and misery in the character of Serena now . Them relationship has continued to diminish throughout the time that we 've seen in season 1 and throughout season 2 .
How much of their old relationship do you think Fred and Serena allowed to creep into Gilead , behind closed doors ?
When they first moved in , I think they broke the rules . I think they totally hung out in their bedroom and did stuff they should n't have been doing in Gilead . They did have fun . But slowly that corruption , that power , that greed took over the Commander , and Gilead started to do what it does best — and that is pitted everyone against everyone . You ca n't really have an ally .
Speaking of allies , where does their relationship with June stand now after they entrust them with the documents ?
I do think it 's genuine at the moment . I do think they need somebody . God knows what 's going to happen between them and Fred — she 's still really isolated — and that slowly gets to you after awhile . But it 's hard with Offred because although they do try to be a little more friendly with her , then Offred goes and asks to see them kid , which is like a slap in the face .
How dangerous is what Serena is doing right now — signing Fred 's name onto something which they may not approve of or with which they may not agree ?
I think there still is an element of feeling safe at that point — just because they do have somewhat of an alliance , just in terms of you know how it 's kind of implied they set up the marriage of Nick and Eden . It 's those little secrets that they do hold together — there 's still an element of an alliance between them . So there 's still a little bit of “ I 'm going to have your back ; you have my back ” — even though there are plenty of other ways they do n't do that for each other . So I do n't think it 's super , super dangerous at this point . In a lot of ways , they have to protect them by doing this [ and ] in a lot of ways they do need them back in the household for them to really be fulfilled in their goal , which is the child . That child is really going to make their happiness come alive . But I think there is definitely a line where that would not be OK anymore , depending on how involved Serena gets in their work .
What do you think it took for them to turn off the woman from years earlier to become the woman they are in Gilead today ?
I think there 's this big idea of what one has to do for the greater good , and I do think that she , initially , did have a passion and a desire to inspire women to focus on their biology and produce babies . That was a good , positive thing that they were doing . They understood the state of the world and that the human race may become extinct , seeing the rate that the world was going . They wanted to do something about it . They planted those seeds and started that ball rolling and then at some point they lost them voice .
In your mind , does that other version of them still exist ?
They were involved in the original discussions of the architecture of Gilead [ so ] it 's this weird , twisted set of conflicting dialogue in their brain about how ultimately this will be for the greater good because we will improve the world and we will improve the human race and we will make babies in Gilead . So part of what we have to do is sacrifice . And my sacrifice will be giving up part of who I am for the sake of this new world . And I think she 's always been a woman of faith — that 's a very strong element of that character — and that 's a huge driving force behind the rest of it .
Will they come to regret any of their decisions this season , even as far back as decisions made that helped usher in Gilead ?
I think there probably are a lot of regrets , but I also think those are just not winning right now in their brain , and they have n't been for awhile . I think what 's winning is that overriding notion that ‘ I 'm doing this for the greater good and all will be well in the end and we are the generation that has to tough it out because the next generation wo n't know it is like we knew it — they wo n't know the “ before ” world . I think Serena still has a lot of hope , and that hope lies in the future child . I do n't know what would happen if they lost that hope . I expect change for her , but until they lose ultimate hope in Gilead I do n't know that she 's going to acknowledge all of them regrets .
Do you personally find anything hopeful about the show ?
It 's hard to have hope ! Ultimately , I think , as an actor I do n't know that I want that . I enjoy so much this dark world that we explore that 's full of despair and tragedy and things you 're not allowed to say . It 's just so riveting to be able to come to work and play in that world . For me , I do n't know that I want things to get better for Serena . In fact , it would probably be more fun if they got worse . Bring it on !

THIS is part two of the series on why the Artistic and Cultural Community is opposing government 's plan to relocate the National Cultural Centre ( NCC ) and Cultural Development Foundation ( CDF ) from their Barnard Hill location in favour of temporary buildings for the courts .
In this part , ACCT ( Artistic and Cultural Community Team ) , a coordinating group for the Artistic and Cultural Community , looks at the unsuitability of the alternative site being proposed for the Cultural Centre . It also recommends solutions for locating the Halls of Justice .
If Barnard Hill is ideal for a cultural complex , then the alternative site at Choc/Union being proposed for a Cultural Centre is totally unsuitable . It is a smaller area of land — 1.5 acres compared to the 4.5 acres at Barnard Hill but , more critically , it is prone to severe flooding .
As far back as 1999 , a Consultant 's Report on the impact of Tropical Storm Debbie ( 1994 ) pointed out that this area would always be flooded whenever the adjacent Union River became swollen as a result of stormy weather . There is a more calamitous feature to that site – one that has developed during the last sixteen years .
What was a small pothole that suddenly appeared , as these things do , has now mushroomed into a huge pond or pool which keeps expanding at the same time as its perimeter is also continuing to collapse into itself . The suspicion is that it is a sinkhole . The Google Map below of the site shows this ominous pool . In addition to this danger , the site is close to an active quarry and quarry dust is a menace to sensitive electronic equipment . It is simply not the place to build a centre for the arts and culture .
Then there is the exorbitant cost of buying that area of land . Based on the current market value of land in the area of the alternative site at Union , it is estimated that the cost of the acquisition of the land for the cultural centre will be in the vicinity of four and a half million dollars . Why should the government spend four million dollars to purchase land for a cultural facility when the current cultural centre is on a much larger amount of land which the government already owns ? That amount of money is more than sufficient to construct a cultural complex along the lines that were suggested in Part 1 of this series .
Creative Solutions for a Hall of Justice
On the other hand , a Halls of Justice is most suited in the centre of a city , like all other central Courts in any civilized community or country . A Halls of Justice , like a Cathedral , must be identified as a central point in a city . The government should consider this very carefully before establishing a Halls of Justice in place of the Cultural Centre , particularly as it has been officially stated that the structure contemplated is temporary . There are alternative and readily available sites for the Halls of Justice , both temporary and permanent .
At present , there are two buildings in the centre of the city belonging to the government which are no longer used but which were associated with the Courts . These are the original Courthouse and the property at the corner of Laborie and Micoud Streets , which formerly housed the Registry of Civil Status and Registry of Companies and Intellectual Property .
It is suggested that these two buildings be sold to a company with the government having majority shares and offering shares to the public with a guarantee of the rental to facilitate an income to its shareholders as was done with the establishment of the St. Lucia Electricity Services Limited comprising of the government , City Council and the public of St. Lucia .
This would release the government from any direct involvement in the erection and maintenance in any such structure . It would also give Saint Lucians the opportunity of not only owning part of public properties in their country but also give an opportunity to them , through their representation on a Board of Directors , to influence and maintain such a structure .
This proposal would free the government from any debt burden and give Saint Lucians an opportunity to invest in their own country much like the Syrian community is involved in property development in St. Lucia .
We also have belonging to the government the destroyed fire service and Port Police building on Jeremie Street , which is vacant and ready for development . This area could also be used as part of a Halls of Justice itself , complimenting the two other areas mentioned , or perhaps , it could be used and developed as a Hall of Justice , which would complement the Government Buildings opposite .
These suggestions are intended to show not only that the land on which the Cultural Centre is located at Barnard Hill is inappropriate for a Halls of Justice but that there are alternative government sites in Castries readily available which could house a Halls of Justice and be more appropriate and befitting for the location of a Halls of Justice in the center of the city . More importantly , a Halls of Justice could be built almost immediately without any debt burden to the government or displacement of the Arts and Cultural Community from Barnard Hill .
President Trump has used their favorite social media platform to make an unusual literary recommendation : a book called `` Reasons to Vote for Democrats '' by Michael J. Knowles .
Trump 's plug is n't an indication that the Republican president is ready to reach across the aisle and work with their progressive detractors , however . The 256-page book is mostly blank , with a table of contents and chapter titles providing the only text .
Knowles ' novelty book has become a big hit with Republicans . As of Monday morning , it ranked No . 85 among all books on Amazon , and it boasts blurbs from popular conservatives like Ben Shapiro ( `` Thorough . '' ) and Michelle Malkin ( `` A real page-turner ! `` ) .
Fans of Trump might be delighted by the book , but the idea behind it is not an original one . In December , former Oregon First Lady Cylvia Hayes , a Democrat , published `` Surprising Reasons to Believe Trump Will Be a ( Bigly ) Great President ! '' under the pen name Dr. Ann Alystiam . The 150-page book , published by a small press in Bend , Ore. , is entirely blank .
Knowles ' book , which was released last week , is published by Threshold Editions , the conservative Simon & Schuster imprint that has also published books by Rush Limbaugh , Dinesh D'Souza and Glenn Beck , as well as Trump himself .
The imprint made news in December when it announced it would be publishing `` Dangerous , '' a book by controversial conservative provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos , who had been banned from Twitter after a controversy following the harassment of `` Saturday Night Live '' actor Leslie Jones on the social media platform .
In February , after video recordings surfaced of Yiannopoulos appearing to defend sex between older men and underage boys , Threshold announced that it had canceled the “ alt-right ” author 's book deal .
Stunt books like the ones by Knowles and Hayes have become somewhat ubiquitous in the last few months . On Amazon , customers can buy blank books with titles like `` Why Trump Deserves Trust , Respect and Admiration '' and `` The Best Reasons to Vote for Democrats . ''
Many of the listings for the books make clear that the pages are blank . A disclaimer on Knowles ' book reads , `` Lefty lawyers require that we state the book is mostly blank and contains precisely 1,235 words . ''
Book recommendations from Trump are relatively rare . They have said in the past that they enjoy reading , but rarely has time to go through a whole book .
In the past , he 's cited their own books , the Bible and `` All Quiet on the Western Front '' as their favorites .
But in an interview with Tucker Carlson last month , Trump seemed to struggle to name books with actual text in them that he 'd recently read .
`` Actually , I 'm looking at a book , I 'm reading a book , I 'm trying to get started . Every time I do about a half a page , I get a phone call that there 's some emergency , this or that , '' they said . `` But we 're going to see the home of Andrew Jackson today in Tennessee and I 'm reading a book on Andrew Jackson . I love to read . I do n't get to read very much , Tucker , because I 'm working very hard on lots of different things , including getting costs down . ''
For most centenarians a facelift would be an ill-advised move , but La Cañada 's historic Lanterman House would be nothing without the surgical attentions of a few professionals committed to keeping it in top condition .
Under the skillful hands of specialist Bob Burchman , owner of Santa Monica-based Landmark Decorative Painting and Restoration , the ceiling of what was Roy and Emily Lanterman 's master bedroom is currently being returned to its original state .
Burchman and their assistant Bettina Wilson began cloaking the period furniture and Lanterman belongings on Monday for what they anticipate will be a three-week project at the museum . The work is one of many Lanterman-related duties undertaken by Burchman and now-retired partner Ed Pinson over the years .
“ There has n't been a project that 's called us back as many times as this , ” Burchman said of the structure , designed in 1915 by Arthur Haley .

Lanterman House Executive Director Melissa Patton admits restoring the plaster walls originally decorated with wallpaper by Emily Lanterman , and repairing cracks and stress fractures in the hand-painted decorative ceiling , is no small feat .
“ An amazing amount of artistic labor went into this house [ when it was built ] , ” Patton said . “ It would be a huge disservice not to restore it to the way that it was . ”
The $ 10,000 restoration , paid for with funds raised by the Lanterman Historical Museum Foundation , is n't the first makeover the master bedroom has undergone since the stately Encinas Drive homestead was bequeathed to the city after the 1987 death of Lloyd Lanterman and dedicated in the early 1990s as La Cañada 's historic museum .
“ This is the fourth time this ceiling has been worked on , ” Patton said .
With the furniture draped in a clear plastic drop cloth , Wilson places small segments of blue painters tape to indicate hundreds of stress fractures on the wall . Burchman uses a large dremel-like tool to gouge open cracks that have ripped straight across the ceiling . They explain this will make the repairs deeper and more lasting than mere spackling .
“ That 's like putting a Band-Aid on it , ” they said of spackling . “ It does n't do any good — it 's just cosmetic , like putting makeup over a pimple . ”
To preserve the integrity of hand-painted flowers , the pair traced the patterns onto paper they can then trace over in a transfer process . Every single color has been perfectly matched to the original , Burchman assures .
The end product will be a a far cry from the state of the room when the city took ownership of Lanterman House , according to Patton — who winces at the memory of discovering that Frank Lanterman , Roy 's older brother , had used their late parents ' bedroom to store old , dirty pipe organ pieces and equipment — but one that seems appropriate given the house 's provenance . Frank Lanterman , who passed away in 1981 , for nearly three decades represented the area and surrounding communities in the state Assembly .
“ One of the things we 're really proud of is that the house has been absolutely professionally restored , to the extent that we can do , so it 's the same as when it was built , ” Patton said .

Ada is a pleasant little town in south central Oklahoma with a nice airport ( KADH ) , but there 's nothing obvious to attract pilots to visit there except perhaps to refuel on a cross-country flight .
However , at least twice a year for the past 16 years , aircraft owners from all over the world have descended on Ada to attend the Advanced Pilot Seminar ( APS ) , sometimes described as “ the Church of Lean-of-Peak . ”
The 2-1/2 day APS course , which has revolutionized how pilots operate aircraft piston engines , is hosted by sister companies General Aviation Modifications , Inc. ( GAMI ) and Tornado Alley Turbo ( TAT ) .
Located next door to each other at the Ada airport , the companies share common ownership . GAMI manufactures GAMIjectors , which are after-market fuel injectors that balance fuel flow and make lean-of-peak ( LOP ) operation possible . TAT produces turbo-normalizing systems for Bonanzas and other high performance singles and LOP operation of its turbo system is highly recommended .
The APS course germinated on the CompuServe AVSIG forum back in the 1990s , during the days of dial-up modems . After meeting online and learning they shared many then-controversial opinions about proper engine operation , course founders John Deakin , George Braly and Walter Atkinson decided to meet at Oshkosh and camp together in the North 40 .
Each of the founders has a unique background . Deakin is a former Air America pilot who retired as a Japan Airlines 747 captain and lives in Southern California . They were already well known as an early contributor to AVSIG and later than author of the monthly Pelican 's Perch column for AvWeb .
Braly , who has run 10 engines to TBO , is a longtime pilot and entrepreneur who was raised on a ranch near Ada . They have dual degrees in aeronautical engineering and law and is co-owner and chief engineer of GAMI .
Atkinson is a native of Shreveport , Louisiana , who now lives at an airpark near Jackson , Mississippi . A retired dentist with ATP , CFII and A & P ratings , they have thousands of hours of flying experience and their computerized course presentation , which has been enhanced over the years , is both informative and entertaining .
“ George Braly introduced the GAMI line of balanced fuel injectors in the mid-90s and John Deakin bought the first set , ” said Atkinson , who bought set number 3 . “ Those injectors , along with sophisticated graphic engine monitors , have proven to be the key to successful lean-of-peak operation . ”
At about the same time , Braly built a highly-instrumented aircraft engine test facility at GAMI that allows an engine to be run under conditions that would never be attempted in the air .
“ We learned how to operate aircraft engines lean-of-peak like the airlines routinely did back in the days of radial engines , ” said Braly . “ The trick is having balanced fuel injectors and the knowledge to operate the engine properly . ”
“ It 's amazing how many pilots have no clue about engine management , ” added Atkinson , “ but it 's pretty easy to win an argument when science is on your side . ”
“ After we wrote extensively on the Internet about the many advantages of LOP operation , friends kept pestering us to do a live class on proper engine management , so we thought we would give the course one time and shut up , ” continued Atkinson .
About 20 pilots attended the first class and several articles were written on lean-of-peak operation , which was then a radical departure from the typical advice to lean an engine gradually until it runs rough and then richen slightly .
Unfortunately , operating that way , typically 50° rich of peak , puts the engine in the now-famous “ red box , ” where it experiences maximum internal stress .
The APS course does not condemn pilots who choose to fly rich-of-peak for maximum speed . Instead , the advice is to be sure to run rich enough ( probably at least 100° rich ) to avoid damage to the engine .
According to the APS instructors , operating LOP results in about a three knot speed penalty , but they point out that a destination can often be reached quicker if the reduced fuel burn means a fuel stop can be eliminated .
“ For three years we ran a class every 60 days and after 16 years of doing this we 're now mainstream , ” said Atkinson , with a laugh . “ It was a lot more fun to be renegades , but so far it 's remained enjoyable to share our knowledge and we plan to continue as long as we keep ticking . ”
Deakin is 78 , Atkinson is 68 and Braly is 67 .
The trio has taken the show on the road a few times , including Australia , and they 've also developed a $ 395 online course that comes free with the $ 995 cost of the live presentation .
Although spending almost a thousand dollars , plus travel expenses , to attend the seminar in Ada may seem high , I heard no complaints when I attended last October . For an active pilot , the 20 % fuel savings from operating LOP will pay for the seminar in short order . Plus , lower cylinder head temps result in longer engine life .
The next “ basic ” APS course in Ada is scheduled for March 17-19 , 2017 . There is also a new “ advanced ” course for graduates of the basic course , which has been offered once so far and will probably be scheduled again soon .
In addition , the APS course will be offered in Europe for the first time this year . It is scheduled for June 23-25 , 2017 , in Kortrijk , Belgium .
JAKARTA ( Reuters ) - The captain of a sinking Indonesian ferry managed to steer their ship onto a reef to enable the evacuation of more than 100 passengers , but 31 people drowned as the vessel floundered in stormy seas , officials said on Wednesday .
The latest ferry disaster in Indonesia , which happened on Tuesday near Sulawesi island , came two weeks after an overcrowded ferry sank on Lake Toba in Sumatra , one of the world 's deepest volcanic lakes , with the death of more than 200 people .
The national search and rescue agency said the boat that ran into trouble near Sulawesi had been carrying 164 passengers and crew . Three passengers were missing but 130 had been rescued , a transport ministry official said .
The ferry was also carrying 48 vehicles when it began taking on water in bad weather .

“ The captain ran it onto a reef so it would n't sink and to make the evacuation of passengers easier , ” Agus H. Purnomo , the director general of sea transportation , said in a statement .
“ The captain and the owner of the ship were the last two people to come down from the passenger ship , ” they added .
Television images showed dozens of passengers hanging on to the keeling vessel or bobbing in the water wearing life jackets .
Indonesia , a vast archipelago made up of more than 17,000 islands , suffers frequent boat accidents , with basic safety rules often flouted and vessels overloaded .
After last month 's sinking in Sumatra , one of the deadliest in nearly a decade , a two-week search and rescue effort found the vessel at a depth of 450 m ( 1,500 ft ) with victims trapped inside , but technical and logistical challenges forced the recovery to be called off .

( Reuters ) - Severe pain has forced Lady Gaga to cancel 10 shows on the European leg of their “ Joanne ” concert tour , the singer and their team said on Saturday , several months after they had postponed those performances in Europe due to their ailment .
Lady Gaga , whose hit songs include “ Bad Romance ” and “ Born This Way , ” has previously said they suffer from fibromyalgia , a musculoskeletal pain disorder often accompanied by fatigue and cognitive difficulties .
A statement posted on Lady Gaga 's Twitter and Instagram pages did not mention fibromyalgia but said the 31-year-old singer decided to cancel the shows after consulting with their medical team .
“ Unfortunately , Lady Gaga is suffering from severe pain that has materially impacted their ability to perform live , ” the statement said .
In an accompanying statement on social media , Lady Gaga said they were devastated to cancel the shows , which included stops in London , Zurich , Stockholm , Paris and Berlin .
“ I promise I will be back in your city , but for now , I need to put myself and my well-being first , ” they said .
Lady Gaga became famous in 2008 as a pop artist , with the hook-laden songs “ Just Dance ” and “ Pokerface. ” They quickly gained a reputation for provocative fashion choices , such as the dress made of raw beef that they wore at a 2010 awards show .

The “ Joanne ” tour , named after the singer 's rock-style album released in 2016 , was promoted by Live Nation Entertainment Inc . They began the tour on Aug. 1 in Vancouver , Canada , the first of more than 40 shows across North America .
In September , Lady Gaga said that due to severe pain , they had to postpone the tour 's European leg , which had originally been scheduled to start on Sept. 21 in Barcelona , Spain .
At the time , they posted photos online of themselves in a hospital with a drip in their arm .
Those European shows were rescheduled to early this year .
On Jan. 14 , Lady Gaga performed in Barcelona and went on to Italy , the Netherlands and Germany . Them most recent concert was on Thursday evening in Birmingham , England .
Lady Gaga ranked 14th on music industry trade publication Pollstar 's list of top-grossing concert tours of 2017 , with sales of nearly $ 86 million from their shows in North America .
The singer was hospitalized in 2013 for a hip injury , and a documentary , “ Lady Gaga : Five Foot Two , ” revealed their struggles with chronic pain .
Bengaluru : Karnataka will soon waive the loans of all farmers in two phases as promised in the manifesto of the ruling Janata Dal ( Secular ) , said chief minister HD Kumaraswamy on Wednesday .
`` In the next 15 days , we will notify a two-phase scheme to waive loans of all farmers especially small and marginal who raised them from state cooperatives , rural and state-run banks over the last nine years , '' Kumaraswamy told reporters after a meeting with representatives of about 30 farmers ' associations in the state secretariat here .
Deputy chief minister G Parameshwara , who represents the Congress in the coalition government , and opposition BJP 's deputy leader in the Assembly Govind M Karjol also participated in the meeting that lasted over two hours . `` As I am heading a coalition government , I will have to discuss the modalities of the loan waiver with Congress leaders , including its president Rahul Gandhi , before notifying it , '' said Kumaraswamy .
Admitting that the JD ( S ) had promised to waive farm loans , including interest on them if elected to power , the chief minister said as the party did not get a clear mandate in the 12 May Assembly elections , they had to consult the Congress over the decision since it involved a huge amount ( Rs 53,000 crore ) of government funds . `` Only 36 JD ( S ) candidates got elected , relegating our party to the third position after the BJP with 104 seats and the Congress with 78 seats . `` As a result , I could not fulfil the promise made in the manifesto . As we are committed to the welfare of the farmers , we will waive their loans after consulting Congress and officials , '' they said .
The BJP has threatened to launch a mass agitation across the state if the JD ( S ) -Congress government fails to waive off the farm loans at the earliest . `` I am committed to implement my promise on the waiver of farm loans , '' said Kumaraswamy .

OTTAWA – The reverend for a church in the rural Ottawa community of Bearbrook is calling for the return of a bell they suspect was stolen for scrap metal last week .
Rev . Margo Whittaker says it 's not clear exactly when on May 21 the 100-kilogram bell was taken from Trinity Anglican Church , but they say how it was stolen became evident when a piece of it was found on the church grounds later that day .
They say a handyman for the church found the piece of the bell on the ground , then climbed the belfry to discover it was missing .

Whittaker says the handyman then spoke to the groundskeeper , who recalled filling up a hole beside the church that was the same shape as a bell .
They say they believe at least two people used a ladder to climb up to the belfry , detach the bell and drop it to the ground , before making a getaway .
Whittaker says members of the congregation are “ very upset , ” adding that the church has been in the community for more than 120 years .
“ There are a lot of people who have history here , ” they said . “ We have a huge cemetery and there are hundreds of people who have relatives buried in the cemetery on the church ground , and we would like to ring the bell at the cemetery service , which is coming up on Father 's Day . ”

They said the congregation is praying that whoever took the bell will have a change of heart , or that someone will give information that will lead to its return .
“ There are stories of church bells being stolen and then church bells being found , ” Whittaker said . “ It 's not unprecedented … and that gives me hope . ”
Ottawa police said they have received a report on the alleged theft and investigators are checking local scrapyards .

AFC Dunstable suffered their heaviest defeat of the season on Saturday as they went down 3-0 at Kidlington .
Having lost three of their previous four Southern Lague games , their hopes of a spot in the play offs were left hanging by a thread .
Knowing Kidlington would be a tough fixture , it did not help as BJ Christie was given their marching orders after only 15 minutes for an alleged stamp .
The visitors though gave a good account of themselves in the opening period and threatened the hosts ' goal .
The second half was a different affair , as fatigue crept in and Kidlington took full advantage of AFC 's misfortune . Elliott Osborne-Ricketts put them in front , with further strikes from Anaclet Odhiambo and Lewis Coyle sealing the win .
The Tom Cruise-led ‘ Mummy ' reboot fared far better overseas , opening to nearly $ 142 million internationally ; ‘ Wonder Woman ' easily stays No . 1 in North America after falling a scant 45 percent in its second weekend .
One of Hollywood 's most iconic monsters was no match for an Amazonian princess-turned-superhero at the North America box office over the weekend .
Universal 's The Mummy , starring Tom Cruise , opened to a withering $ 32.2 million domestically from 4,035 theaters , a dismal start for summer event film that launches Universal 's new Dark Universe of interconnected monster movies . The movie fared far better overseas with a winning $ 141.8 million from 63 markets , Cruise 's best international opening .
In the U.S. , The Mummy was relegated to second place behind Warner Bros. ' box-office sensation Wonder Woman , which fell a scant 45 percent in its second weekend to $ 57.2 million from 4,165 theaters . That 's one of the lowest drops ever for a superhero tentpole . Generally speaking , a superhero film can fall 60 percent .
Wonder Woman , directed by Patty Jenkins , jumped the $ 200 million mark domestically on Sunday , its tenth day in release . Overseas , it took in another $ 58.1 million for a foreign tally of $ 230 million and $ 435 million globally . The movie is a much-needed win for Warner Bros. 's DC Extended Universe of superhero titles .
Conversely , The Mummy , costing $ 125 million to make after rebates , is a rough start for Universal 's monsters-themed Dark Universe ..
Plagued by withering reviews and a B- CinemaScore from audiences , The Mummy opened behind any of the openings for the Mummy films starring Brendan Fraser , as well as for spin-off The Scorpion King . Unlike those movies , the reboot decided to fashion itself as an action pic set in modern times .
Universal executives said on Sunday that each Dark Universal title will be its own entity . Up next is Bill Condon 's Bride of Frankenstein . They also said The Mummy ‘ s global launch was impressive overall .
“ Kudos to the filmmakers . I myself have seen the movie five times . And kudos to the cast , especially Tom Cruise , ” said Universal domestic distribution president Nick Carpou . “ Unfortunately in the U.S. , the critical acclaim was n't there to the degree that people use that as a guidepost . ”
The Mummy ‘ s ultimate financial standing will largely depend on its foreign showing . Universal notes that the movie 's global debut of $ 174 million is also the best for the actor . All told , it opened No . 1 in 46 markets . China led with $ 52.2 million . The Middle Kingdom was one of 46 markets where The Mummy marked Cruise 's top showing to date .
Directed by Alex Kurtzman , the story follows an ancient princess ( Sofia Boutella ) who is awakened from their crypt beneath the desert , threatening humankind . Cruise plays the man who discovers the tomb of Ahmanet and unleashes them powers . The film cost $ 125 million to make after tax rebates . Russell Crowe and Annabella Wallis also star .
Captain Underpants , Pirates of the Caribbean : Dead Men Tell No Tales and Guardians of the Galaxy Vol . 2 rounded out the top five .
In its second weekend , DreamWorks Animation 's Captain Underpants slipped 48 percent to $ 12.3 million for a domestic total of $ 44.6 million .
Pirates 5 jumped the $ 600 million mark globally earning $ 10.7 million domestically and $ 38.4 million overseas . The movie has earned far more internationally , or $ 464.4 million . Fellow Disney release Guardians of the Galaxy Vol . 2 rounded out the top five with $ 6.2 million domestically for a worldwide tally of $ 833.2 million .
Two other movies from a pair of indie distributors also opened nationwide this weekend : A24 's apocalyptic horror film It Comes at Night and Bleecker Street 's drama Megan Leavey , starring Kate Mara as a young Marine fighting in Iraq with their bomb-sniffing combat dog .
It Comes at Night , opening in 2,500 theaters and coming in No . 6 , grossed a solid $ 6 million from 2,253 theaters despite a D CinemaScore . Directed by Trey Edward Shults ( Krisha ) , the $ 5 million film stars Joel Edgerton as a man trying to protect their family from an unnatural threat , only to find their plan go awry upon the arrival of another desperate family .
Meagan Leavey , nabbing an A CinemaScore , debuted to $ 3.8 million from 1,956 cinemas , ahead of expectations .
Additionally , Fox Searchlight 's release of My Cousin Rachel starring Rachel Weisz , delivered an estimated $ 954k from 523 theaters , a meager $ 1,824 per theater average .
In limited release , Roadside 's release of Beatriz at Dinner delivered an estimated $ 150,160 from five theaters for a strong , $ 30,032 per theater average . Oscilloscope 's Night School debuted at the IFC Center in New York and brought in an estimated $ 1,600 after playing to several sold out shows over the weekend in the 40 seat auditorium . Freestyle 's release of Miles debuted in two theaters and brought in an estimated $ 5,176 ( $ 1,676 PTA ) while The Orchard 's The Hero debuted with an estimated $ 48,414 from four screens for a $ 12,104 average .
Next weekend sees four new wide releases hitting theaters , three of which will be playing in over 3,000 locations . Among them , Disney and Pixar 's Cars 3 is looking to debut in over 3,900 theaters , Entertainment Studios will release 47 Meters Down in ~3,500 theaters and Sony will release the R-rated comedy Rough Night in over 3,000 theaters . Lionsgate 's release of Summit 's All Eyez on Me , telling the story of rapper 2Pac , will also be hitting theaters , debuting in ~2,400 locations .

One of the stalwarts of South Bristol 's premier shopping street is to close - and set up home within a supermarket a mile and a half away .
The first casualty of the buy-out of catalogue store Argos by supermarket giant Sainsbury 's in Bristol looks set to be the branch in Bedminster .
Argos is understood to be closing down its large branch in East Street , where it occupies an important position in the car-free main street of BS3 .
And the following day , the store will reopen within the building at Sainsbury 's a mile and a half away in Winterstoke Road , Ashton .
Sainsbury 's already operates an Argos ‘ click and collect facility ' at its large supermarket close to Ashton Gate Stadium , and has done since soon after the £1.4 billion takeover of the catalogue store last year .
Argos told South Bristol Voice that all 15 employees of the store in Bedminster 's East Street will be moved to Sainsbury 's .
The date for the big move has not been confirmed , but it is understood to be August 23 and August 24 .

Trashing the Paris Agreement made for a great campaign prop at Donald Trump 's rallies , where the climate change accord was portrayed as a product of the out-of-touch , insufferable elites that Trump pledged to sweep from power .
Now the landmark agreement , signed under President Obama , is fast becoming a nuisance for President Trump 's White House .
It is putting the president under increasing pressure from places they may not have expected . Their own secretary of State appears to see little upside in the president following through on the signature campaign vow to scrap it . Their ambassador to the United Nations is hedging . And titans of industries that Trump promised would be unleashed to create new jobs once freed from the agreement 's constraints are openly hostile to Trump 's plan to put it through the shredder .
Even the American Coal Council has yet to muster a tepid cheer for Trump 's denunciations of the United Nations-sponsored climate plan . As for the power companies Trump warned would be forced by Paris to raise their rates trillions of dollars ? Their trade group , the Edison Electric Institute , does n't even have a position on the agreement .
The reticence toward Trump 's tough talk about the nearly 200-nation accord reflects how much has changed in perceptions of the global warming threat since the White House was last occupied by a president disdainful of international efforts to contain it .
CEOs have grown more panicked about the impact global warming will have on business stability than the cost of confronting it . And it is not just Ben and Jerry 's types that have already invested a tremendous amount in redirecting their entire business model to account for climate .
Outside the confines of Trump campaign rallies , the offices of a few free market think tanks and the tea party stalwarts in Congress , the broader consensus is that abandoning Paris wo n't save trillions of dollars , as Trump promised , but hurt the economy .
Exxon Mobil is all in on Paris , which aims to contain global warming to less than 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial-age levels ; so are DuPont , Unilever and Monsanto , the multinational genetically engineered food juggernaut that often tangles with the environmental movement . Half of the companies on the Fortune 500 already have greenhouse gas reduction plans in place .
“ This is directly related to our business , ” said Gabriela Burian , director of global sustainable agriculture at Monsanto . “ We need to provide solutions while farmers are facing climate change . ”
Monsanto is on track to be carbon neutral by 2021 and has long accepted as fact something the Trump administration has not : that absent swift action , human-induced climate change could be catastrophic for business . It was among the more than 745 companies and big investors that signed a post-election letter expressing full support for the accord . The signatories collectively employ more than 1.8 million Americans .
Many Republican heavyweights are meanwhile sending a clear signal to the White House that their dislike of the Clean Power Plan — the Obama administration 's blueprint for meeting America 's obligations under the climate pact — should not be confused with support for Trump 's repudiation of all climate action .
A group of GOP gurus that includes former Secretaries of State James A. Baker and George P. Shultz , former Secretary of the Treasury Henry M. Paulson , and lead economic advisors for Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush visited the White House last week to implore the administration to approach climate policy the way it appears to be dealing with Obamacare . Repealing the Obama climate plan and replacing it with nothing , they warned , is a perilous path .
The group lobbied for a tax on carbon , a climate change solution long championed by economists across political boundaries — and one this particular group noted would enable the United States to meet the obligations laid out in Paris .
“ The risks are too great to ignore , ” Baker , a longtime climate skeptic himself , said of climate change . “ We need some sort of insurance policy . ”
The Paris accord does n't set particularly onerous standards on U.S. emissions . The boom in natural gas production , plunging prices of wind and solar power and evolution of energy-efficient technologies — along with the embrace of sustainability by American businesses — has the U.S. well on its way to meeting its goals under the pact . Unlike Obama 's Clean Power Plan , which sets very strict rules for how electric plants can operate , the accord is a broader pledge to take a leadership role in the climate fight .
“ If we do n't decide to participate , it is still moving forward , ” said Gina McCarthy , who ran the Environmental Protection Agency when Obama signed the accord . “ We are simply going to cede those opportunities to other countries . ”
China has already made clear it is prepared to step into the breach , reaffirming its commitment last month at the World Economic Forum meeting in Davos , Switzerland , where President Xi Jinping unveiled a plan to invest $ 360 billion in renewables and suspend production of 101 coal plants .
“ Donald Trump is used to winning things , not walking away like a scalded dog , ” said Bob Inglis , a former GOP member of congress from South Carolina . “ Leaving a very hard won international agreement on the table so China can lead the world would be a strange look . ”
Trump may opt to leave the agreement in place and instead move to aggressively erase the federal emissions rules it inspired . But that approach is certain to generate more blowback than Trump may have anticipated .
“ The reason the Paris accord got signed is because so many companies wanted this , ” said Andrew Hoffman , professor at University of Michigan 's Ross School of Business . “ They are moving on this stuff , and the policies of one administration are not going to radically shift their direction . ”

Brits are a nation of telly watchers , and according to a new survey , comedy is always what has kept us glued to the small screen .
A poll by galabingo.com asked UK viewers for their favourite TV moments , from the 70s till the present day , and while soaps , reality TV and even this decade 's more highbrow winner figured strongly , it was sitcoms which took the bulk of the votes . 167 scenes from Only Fools and Horses being nominated , the Trotters coming top of the poll in two decades .
Another angle may be of particular interest to the court 's newest member , Justice Neil Gorsuch : the question of how much of Congress ' constitutional authority it can give away to the president . Under a longstanding constitutional principle , each branch of government must , in essence , stay in its constitutionally allocated lane ; it ca n't escape or hand off the powers it has been given by the framers . The legislature , for example , ca n't punt to the president or the judiciary on its obligation to levy taxes and appropriate funds . This is known as the nondelegation doctrine : Each branch must fully own the responsibilities that the Constitution gives it .
LOS ANGELES -- The Los Angeles Dodgers placed left-handed pitcher Rich Hill on the 10-day disabled list on Monday with a blister on the middle finger of their pitching hand .
The Dodgers were hoping Hill would put their blister problems behind them Sunday . Those hopes burst in the third inning of Los Angeles ' 3-1 loss to the Arizona Diamondbacks after Hill aggravated the blister .
Editor 's Picks Real or not ? Dodgers need Rich Hill , the best series of the year
Hill was activated from the 10-day disabled list before the start after missing time with the blister , but they were able to make only 54 pitches on Sunday . The left-hander allowed two runs , five hits and two walks and struck out two .
Hill was upset when they arrived in the dugout after the third inning and went straight to the clubhouse . They returned to the mound to start the fourth inning , but manager Dave Roberts and a trainer met them there for a long conversation before they were pulled .

Last year , Hill was traded from Oakland to the Dodgers in August when they already had a blister issue on the same finger . They signed a three-year , $ 48 million free-agent deal in the offseason with Los Angeles , and there were no issues in spring training this season . Now , though , the blister has reared its ugly head again .
Hill said they noticed the blister had opened while swinging on deck in the second inning . They pitched the third with the popped blister , but said it is n't as bad as last year when it `` completely broke open and was bleeding , raw skin . ''
The Dodgers had eight pitchers in the bullpen Sunday in case Hill 's blister flared up , and they used five of them to finish the game .
`` Every time they take the mound , the uncertainty is tough on everybody , '' Roberts said . `` It 's tough on the team . It 's tough on the pen . And I know Rich understands that . ( We tried to ) give it time , ample time , which we thought 10 days was enough , but apparently it was n't . We have to revisit those conversations . ''
The Dodgers recalled infielder/outfielder Rob Segedin from Triple-A to fill the roster spot .
New York 's governor on Monday directed the state 's attorney general to review the 2015 decision by the Manhattan district attorney 's office to not prosecute a sex abuse case against Harvey Weinstein .
“ It is critical not only that these cases are given the utmost attention but also that there is public confidence in the handling of these cases , ” Gov . Andrew Cuomo said in a statement .

The Democratic governor asked that the review be conducted “ in a way that does not interfere with the current investigation , ” which they said the Manhattan district attorney believes will be completed within approximately 45 days .
The directive comes on the same day that Time 's Up , an initiative started by a powerhouse group of Hollywood industry women to fight systemic sexual harassment , called for Cuomo to investigate the district attorney 's office .
In a statement , the group says a report in New York magazine is disturbing because it suggests the district attorney 's office may have been improperly influenced by Weinstein and sought to intimidate an Italian model who accused the disgraced media mogul of groping them

“ An independent investigation into the full decision-making process in this case , including a full review of the correspondence within the office and with any representatives for Mr. Weinstein , must be undertaken immediately to ensure that prosecutorial integrity was maintained and to restore faith in the DA 's office , ” the statement says .
The article centres on the case of Ambra Battilana Gutierrez . In 2015 , police conducted a sting after they accused Weinstein of groping her , secretly recording Weinstein apologizing for this conduct .
WATCH : The Weinstein Company files for bankruptcy
Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus R. Vance Jr. ultimately decided there was n't enough proof and did n't bring a case . Following criticism over the decision last year , prosecutors said police arranged the sting without their knowledge and there were other proof issues , but police pushed back saying they 'd presented enough evidence .
Danny Frost , a spokesperson for the district attorney 's office , said the allegations in the magazine had “ little resemblance to the facts . The office has an “ unwavering ” commitment to justice in such case and great admiration “ for the courageous women and men who have brought about a long-overdue reckoning with decades of intolerable sexual abuse , ” they said .
READ MORE : Harvey Weinstein had ‘ wing women ' to help with sexual conquests , says lawsuit
Vance 's office is under pressure following the story . Time 's Up , an activist group launched by Hollywood players such as Shonda Rhimes , Reese Witherspoon , and Natalie Portman , has called on New York Governor Andrew Cuomo to launch an independent investigation into the District Attorney 's decision not to take on the 2015 case . Frost was careful to praise Time 's Up while suggesting that such a move is unwarranted .
“ We have great admiration for Time 's Up , and for the courageous women and men who have brought about a long-overdue reckoning with decades of intolerable sexual abuse , ” the statement reads . “ Our commitment to justice in these cases is unwavering and we welcome the engagement that powerful advocates like Time 's Up have brought to this work . ”
Police and prosecutors play different roles , Frost said . Disagreements happen , but they do n't undermine justice , they said .
“ Police evaluate arrests based on probable cause , whereas prosecutors must make sure they can prove to a jury that every element of a criminal statute was violated beyond a reasonable doubt – a much higher standard , ” they said .
Weinstein 's attorneys have said they deny any non-consensual sexual contact .
Since scores of new allegations against Weinstein surfaced , both the New York Police Department and the district attorney 's office have said they are working together , but no grand jury has been convened despite police officials saying publicly they have enough evidence for a case . Less than two weeks ago , the police department 's chief of detectives said witnesses were ready for the grand jury – but it was up to the district attorney to decide when to convene it . Frost said the case is still under active investigation .
The Time 's Up statement says a prosecution of the 2015 case could have prevented other alleged sexual assaults .
“ There will only be real consequences for abusive behaviour when our public officials , sworn to uphold the law , care as much about the rights of the victim as concerns for the accused . ”
The Associated Press does not typically identify people who say they are victims of sexual assault unless they speak publicly , as Battilana Gutierrez has done .
Time 's Up was created by about 300 women and includes the producer Shonda Rhimes and actores Reese Witherspoon and America Ferrera .
'Game Changer ' : Maya Cities Unearthed In Guatemala Forest Using Lasers
Enlarge this image toggle caption PACUNAM/Marcello Canuto & Luke Auld-Thomas PACUNAM/Marcello Canuto & Luke Auld-Thomas
By raining down laser pulses on some 770 square miles of dense forest in northern Guatemala , archaeologists have discovered 60,000 Maya structures that make up full sprawling cities .
And the new technology provides them with an unprecedented view into how the ancient civilization worked , revealing almost industrial agricultural infrastructure and new insights into Maya warfare .
`` This is a game changer , '' says Thomas Garrison , an archaeologist at Ithaca College who is one of the leaders of the project . It changes `` the base level at which we do Maya archaeology . ''
The data reveals that the area was three or four times more densely populated than originally thought . `` I mean , we 're talking about millions of people , conservatively , '' says Garrison . `` Probably more than 10 million people . ''
The researchers fired LiDAR technology , short for `` Light Detection and Ranging , '' down at the dense forest from an airplane . This research was organized by the PACUNAM LiDAR Initiative , and Garrison says the area 's size is `` more than double any other survey that 's been done with this technology . ''
`` As it flies the laser pulses hundreds of thousands of times per second , '' Garrison adds . `` And every time one of those lasers hits a point of resistance it stops and sends back a measurement to the plane . ''
Some of these pulses make it all the way down to the forest floor . The data is then used to visually strip away trees and plants , ultimately mapping only the structures that have been hidden by jungle . You can think of it as digital deforestation .

LiDAR allows scientists to accomplish years or even decades worth of mapping in a single afternoon . For example , Garrison says they were part of a team that worked for some eight years to map less than a square mile at a site called El Zotz . The plane using LiDAR took data for 67 square miles in a matter of hours .
`` It 's very humbling , '' says Garrison . `` For those of us that spent our lives mapping and slogging around this area ... you just sort of have to bow before the LiDAR and accept the fact that it 's better than you are . ''
The team surveyed 10 separate areas . It took months to process the data . As the picture became clearer , Garrison said they would send emails to their colleagues expressing surprise at the magnitude .
They recall seeing an initial image of one area in northern Guatemala . `` I saw this image and I said , the whole area is covered in Maya settlement . You wo n't believe it , '' they add . `` And then once we got the actual data and saw the whole scope of it . We said , 'Wow , we 're going to be able to really do something with this . ' ''
Together , they are able to weave together a picture of individual city-states and their vast support network .
`` Everything is amplified and made much clearer for us and we see how it all fits together in a way that we have not seen before , '' they say . `` We 're seeing it all laid bare , and saying , 'OK , this is how all of this was connected and came together . ' ''
Archeologists , for example , knew that the Maya had agricultural fields . But they say this data show `` huge , huge expanses of these irrigated field systems in these low lying swamps . ''
And they knew that the Maya fought , often with each other , because defensive walls had been previously spotted . But this new information reveals `` Maya fortresses and systems of interconnected watchtowers , '' raising the possibility of more sophisticated and large-scale warfare .
The civilization had a network of raised causeways stretching `` many , many kilometers . '' They also were `` channeling water for hundreds of meters or modifying hilltops so they become these impregnable areas . ''
The picture this paints , they say , is one that is to some extent more advanced than previously thought : `` This is like landscape engineering . They have molded the world around them to serve their purposes and survive . ''

The most important Maya city , Tikal , was found to be three or four times larger than the scientists had thought , with a previously undiscovered pyramid in its center . And Garrison adds that they 're not totally sure they 've surveyed the entire extent of that city .
Suddenly having a broad view allows archaeologists to ask many new questions , they say . And there 's plenty of forest to still explore — the study area is a fraction of the total area where the Maya lived .
The rules of the game in mutual funds are changing quicker than ever . The Securities and Exchange Board of India ( Sebi ) recently announced a set of changes that make it easier to invest in mutual funds . The regulator has permitted people to use e-wallets to invest , and has allowed instant redemptions up to Rs50,000 from liquid funds into bank accounts .
Yet , what Sebi seems to have missed is that the existing infrastructure for settlement and confirmation of mutual fund investments is almost totally geared towards offline , paper-based transactions . The unfortunate image that comes to mind is that of a rocket being carried on a bullock-cart . Much like the advent of dematerialization in the early 2000s , the entire settlement and trade confirmation system needs a reboot so that the investor base can grow to many times its current size .
For instance , the four registrar and transfer agents ( RTAs ) , which settle and confirm all the mutual fund transactions , use woefully out-of-date file structures and formats to exchange transaction data with intermediaries—distributors and registered investment advisers .
• The RTAs exchange data only in the outdated dBase DBF format , first introduced in the early 1980s and which was last updated in the early 1990s . It is virtually impossible to get any technical support for the dBase format , more than 20 years after it went obsolete .
• Images of customer 's agreements , forms and their signatures are shared with RTAs in the uncompressed TIFF format images ( last updated in 1992 ) , which have massive file sizes and are barely used anywhere in the world ( hint to RTAs : use PDFs , please ) .
• Almost all non-financial transaction requests ( such as change of nominee or bank ) require physical documents to be lodged at the RTA 's offices , when there are far more efficient , digital ways of exchanging information .
When we built our online investment platform , we were shocked to see that virtually no API ( application program interface ) was used by the industry for transaction feeds . Almost every self-respecting Web service in the world today uses APIs to give programmatic access to its data so that the information can be exchanged in a real-time , structured manner .
Another concern is the handling of transactions when volumes spike . Most RTAs will confirm transactions only after several back-and-forth communications and ‘ sighting ' of the funds . But exchanges such as the National Stock Exchange had pioneered the concept of real-time payment confirmations years ago . Is that concept so hard to implement in the mutual funds universe ? Any surge in transactions almost inevitably means that there are delays in transaction confirmations—automation could solve so many of these problems relatively easily .
The many regulations around the Know Your Customer ( KYC ) process are now overlapping , confusing and badly designed . For instance , a brand-new investor is now required to perform two KYC validations before they can invest in a mutual fund—one with the new central KYC authority—Central Registry of Securitisation Asset Reconstruction and Security Interest ( Cersai ) —and another with one of the five Sebi-approved KYC Registration Agencies ( KRAs ) . This is because a customer still needs a Permanent Account Number ( PAN ) and their KYC has to be approved by one of the five KRAs before any mutual fund can open an investment folio . And most intermediaries complain that Cersai takes 3-4 days to merely issue an c-KYC number ( KIN ) to a new customer .
Then there 's the investor 's bank account . Some mutual funds and intermediaries validate ownership of bank accounts using a small transfer of Re1 to the customer 's bank account using Immediate Payment Service ( IMPS ) . Customers find this more convenient than uploading a copy of their blank cancelled cheque to validate ownership of the bank account . This is a great example of using technology to speed-up processes and improve the customer on-boarding experience . One hopes that this method would soon be embraced by all fund houses . And yet , when we recently checked with Computer Age Management Services Pvt . Ltd ( CAMS ) and Karvy Computershare Pvt Ltd ( Karvy ) , the two largest RTAs in the country , they were unsure about how an investor 's ownership of a bank account could be validated in the absence of a blank cancelled cheque .
The investor base can only grow when advisers spend less time on operational issues and more on servicing , advising and hand-holding customers to help them meet their investment goals . The market infrastructure and technology stack used by mutual funds is woefully out of date and desperately needs a reboot .
These changes would lead to more participation in the markets and many more product innovations , just like the introduction of demat accounts did for the stock market in the early 2000s . Rather than resist change , the mutual fund industry , especially its infrastructure providers , should embrace technology , so that Sebi 's innovations can soon lead to mutual funds for all .

ISLAMABAD - Expressing displeasure over the slow pace of work by courts , Chief Justice Mian Saqib Nisar on Tuesday observed that none of the courts had achieved a satisfactory disposal rate .
The chief justice directed that the rate of disposal may be taken to 60 percent within the next three months to wipe out the pendency of cases .
They also cautioned that under-performers would be strictly dealt with .
They made these observations after Secretary Law and Justice Commission of Pakistan ( LJCP ) Dr Muhammad Raheem Awan during a meeting presented the institution , pendency and disposal figures of the drug courts from January to June 2018 .
The meeting of all the chairpersons and drug courts was held under the chair of Justice Nisar , who is also the Chairman of National Judicial ( policy-making ) Committee . The meeting reviewed the performance of the drug courts .
During the meeting , the drug courts ' chairpeople said that accelerated disposal could not be achieved mainly due to the shortage of the requisite staff and members of the drug courts .
The chief justice said that shortage of staff should not be an impediment to the dispensation of justice .
The chief justice further directed the secretary LJCP to examine the drug laws in Pakistan for suggesting amendments for expeditious disposal of cases .
The chief justice also directed that the relevant ministries and high courts should be requested to make available resources to the drug courts . They further directed SC Additional Registrar ( Administration ) , Khawaja Daud Ahmad , to also chalk out a plan to look into the problems of the drug courts and contact the relevant authorities for their immediate redressal .
After sitting in the visiting bullpen on Tuesday night , right-hander Matt Frawley will be taking in the game from a different angle on Wednesday at The Joe . The New York Yankees have announced that Frawley has been added to the Charleston RiverDogs roster after being named the player to be named later in a previous deal that sent RHP Johnny Barbato to Pittsburgh .
Frawley , 21 , made 19 appearances in the South Atlantic League with West Virginia , the club currently in town facing the RiverDogs , to start the year , accruing a 1.62 ERA and a 3-1 record in 33.1 innings of relief . The former Purdue Boilermaker fanned 32 and walked just four batters all out of the bullpen for the Power . A native of Elk Grove Village , Ill. , Frawley faced the RiverDogs three times this year , allowing two runs across 7.1 innings pitched with nine strikeouts against their new teammates .
The Yankees have not announced the corresponding roster move to make room for Frawley yet .
The 6 ' 1 ” righty is in their second year in the minor leagues after being drafted in the 17th round in 2016 by the Pirates out of Purdue University . They spent their first professional season split between the Short Season New York-Penn League and the SAL , going 3-1 with a 4.18 ERA over 17 appearances , striking out 33 and walking nine .
During their junior year in 2016 , Frawley led the Boilermakers in ERA ( 2.74 ) , strikeouts ( 58 ) and innings pitched ( 74.1 ) . Their ERA in their final season in West Lafayette ranked seventh in school history among hurlers who tossed at least 60 innings .

What is that light that we see ? It 's the light of a new day , a new horizon . Today we 'll learn about a remarkable equestrian facility which is bringing new light into the lives of children and adults with disabilities .
Joy Miller is co-founder of New Horizon Ranch , located near Rantoul in Franklin County . New Horizon Ranch is a therapeutic horseback riding center . It offers various kinds of equine-assisted activities and learning , psychotherapy , and summer day camp programs to individuals of all ages with physical , cognitive , social , emotional and learning disabilities .
Joy grew up in rural California . As a high schooler , they were selected for the National FFA Band which meant they came to perform at the National FFA Convention which was held in Kansas City at the time . While in Kansas City , they learned about Mid-America Nazarene University in Olathe and ultimately came there as a student .
Them faith and Christian service are important to Joy . “ I thought I would be going into international missions someday , so I majored in international agribusiness so I could help developing countries , ” Joy said .
While at Mid-America Nazarene , they met and married Brian Miller who had grown up in Olathe . They bought a rural property in Franklin County .
“ It was revealed to us that our mission was n't overseas , it was right here , ” Joy said . Brian worked at College Church of the Nazarene in Olathe . They moved to the farm and it seemed natural to get horses . In 2000 , they attended Equifest , the equine exhibition held in Wichita at the time . There they saw a demonstration of therapeutic vaulting with handicapped children , and it intrigued them .
“ We felt called to work with horses and had a heart to help people , ” Joy said . “ We have a passion to help the underserved. ” They learned about the benefits of therapeutic riding for children with disabilities .
The year 2004 was a tumultuous time . “ We had our first child that year , but shortly after that , my 16-year-old brother was killed in a car accident , ” Joy said . The tragedy hit hard and their equine dreams were put on hold .
“ Eighteen months later , our pastor gave a sermon with the message that , if God gives you a dream , then He 's big enough to make it happen , ” Joy said . “ Brian and I looked at each other and said , ` It 's time , ' ” they said . They went to work to realize their equestrian dream of service .
Brian and Joy became Certified Riding Instructors through the Professional Association of Therapeutic Horsemanship International and Certified Equine Specialists through the Equine Assisted Growth and Learning Association . In 2006 , they founded their own therapeutic riding non-profit organization on their ranch .
What to call this new enterprise ? “ We believe that each day with a horse is a new opportunity for the child , ” Joy said . “ It 's a clean slate like the start of a new day , like new light on the horizon , ” they said . “ And we 'd been through a dark time ourselves ( since my brother 's death ) so it was a new horizon for us too. ” Joy and Brian named their operation New Horizon Ranch .
In 2007 , New Horizon Ranch started offering therapeutic riding classes for children and adults with disabilities . “ Let 's use these magnificent , majestic animals and see how many lives can be helped , ” Joy said .
The first class began with seven children . In 2015 , nearly 200 people were directly served by New Horizon Ranch . Today the ranch offers a broad spectrum of therapeutic riding and educational activities in their rural setting near the town of Rantoul , population 242 people . Now , that 's rural .
For more information , see www.newhorizonranch.org .
What is that light that we see ? Is it the light of a distant horizon ? Or maybe , it 's the light in the eyes of a child with special needs who has successfully ridden a horse . We salute Joy and Brian Miller and all those involved with New Horizon Ranch for making a difference in the lives of children through horseback riding .
And there 's more . Belt buckles are now being used to further enrich the lives of these children . We 'll learn about that next week .

LAHORE , Mar 19 ( APP ) : The Sports Board Punjab has set up a 20-bed makeshift hospital , in collaboration with the General Hospital ,
at the National Hockey Stadium to cope with any medical emergency for the two Pakistan Super League ( PSL ) matches in Lahore .
The hospital is equipped with an operation theater and a blood bank . Doctors and paramedical staff has
also been deputed .
It has been established on the instruction of Secretary Sports Punjab Muhammad Aamir Jan as a part of the
elaborate arrangements for the matches , to be played at the Gaddafi Stadium on Wednesday and Thursday
( March 21 and 22 ) .
From there , fiesta-goers had their pick of events , from the Kiwanis Club 's community breakfast and antique car show Saturday to Lanterman House 's summer whites picnic Sunday to YMCA 's annual 1-mile run Monday . Children decked in red , white and blue gawked at fireworks , watched an outdoor movie Saturday night and enjoyed an afternoon in the park on Monday .
Although NBC has already given the greenlight for at least one more season , E ! News recently reported that This Is Us already filmed scenes for its series finale . Just that news alone is enough to have you sobbing . Details surrounding This Is Us ' future were announced during the series ' For Your Consideration Emmy event by This Is Us creator and executive producer Dan Fogelman , according to Deadline . At the event , Fogelman revealed they know exactly how the series is going to end and that some of the scenes have already been shot .
Among the many tidbits shared during the FYC panel — which also featured Mandy Moore , Milo Ventimiglia , Susan Kelechi Watson , Chrissy Metz , Justin Hartley , Chris Sullivan , and Sterling K. Brown ( via Skype ) , according to Deadline — Fogelman announced that the show 's writers ' room was only about four to five episodes into creating the farewell season . They reportedly went on to say , “ I 've already shot pieces of the final scene of the series. ” Of the timeline for the show 's ending , the producer and screenwriter explained ,
`` We 're pretty far out . Our writers and I are kind of to the end . We know where it ends and we have a path for each season of the show . We 've always had a plan . We did n't want to get stuck . We had the kids and the timelines , and had to have a plan . ''
While the show 's ending is obviously going to be a bittersweet moment for all who have hopelessly fallen in love with the Pearson family 's story , Fogelman was careful not to give away too much in terms of timing , other than saying , `` I do n't think this show , despite any success it may or may not have , will overstay its welcome . ”
It 's unclear how long the series intends to remain in production . However , it 's worth noting NBC quickly picked up two additional seasons of This Is Us during its inaugural season . Popsugar also reported that when Fogelman first pitched the pilot , they already had the first four seasons of the show planned out , which means they have a lot more story to tell before it 's all said and done .
With two seasons already aired , and Jack 's incredibly sad cause of death now revealed , This Is Us is gearing up for Season 3 which is set to premiere in September of this year . From the sound of the teases shared by Fogelman and the cast , there will be many more heartwarming and heart-wrenching in store from the Pearsons in upcoming seasons .

In the Season 2 finale , fans were given a cliffhanging sneak peek into what to expect from Season 3 , including Kevin 's relationship with their new girlfriend Zoe ( Beth 's cousin ) , and Kate trying to cope with Toby 's issues with depression . There was also scene that showcased an emotional moment shared between Randall and a future version of Tess , where Tess tells their father , `` I 'm not ready to see her , '' which hinted that something may have happened to one of the female characters on the show .
Those moments undoubtedly left fans on the edge of their seats in anticipation for Season 3 . Brown , who portrays Randall on the series , addressed the scene . According to Deadline , they explained ,
“ That big thing in regards to whom the ‘ it 's time to go see her , I 'm not ready to go see her ' ; I 'm not going to tell you who ( it is ) , but it sort of leads to the end game of our show , not the end of the season per se , but the show as a whole . And who you think the ‘ her ' is , is probably not who it is in typical Fogelman style . ''
Shaking up original fan theories which suggested that Beth could be the `` her '' in question , Brown continued : “ It could be one of those people on stage . ''

Giving away other information about the show 's more immediate future , Fogelman shared that the upcoming season will also `` dive into Jack 's experience in Vietnam , '' according to TVLine . They also revealed that things will get more in-depth for Beth 's storyline , saying the the character , “ will get a deep-dive where we learn about their backstory ; she 'll get a showcase. ” They also revealed that `` Kate and Toby have a journey this season , and it 's a journey about them trying to start a family . ”
While the ending of This Is Us is sadly imminent , it sounds as if there 's much more of the Pearson family coming your way before they say their final goodbyes .
Accra , 24 April 2018 - The SDG Philanthropy Platform ( Ghana ) launched a report entitled “ Enabling Environment for Philanthropy in Ghana , ” to unleash the potential of philanthropic contributions towards the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals ( SDGs ) .
The report was based on a study that analyzed the potential of philanthropy in contributing to national development priorities . The study proposes a number of recommendations for consideration to support philanthropy in Ghana and these include the development and implementation of a national policy or framework to propel reforms in the regulatory environment . It also suggests the amendment of the country 's Companies Act to include additional categories like philanthropy .
Speaking at the launch of the report , Honourable Carlos Ahenkorah , the Deputy Minister for Trade and Industry underscored the importance of creating an enabling environment for philanthropy to foster sustainable development . They said “ we appreciate the valuable effects philanthropy brings on development through the support of Ghana 's social sector . Foundations contributed about $ 500m towards the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals in Ghana and the trend is expected to increase with the more ambitious Sustainable Development Goals. ” They indicated that Government will review the study recommendations to inform policy decisions to promote the growth of indigenous philanthropy , which falls in line with the Government 's Ghana Beyond Aid agenda .
In their remarks at the launch , Gita Honwana Welch , acting UNDP Ghana Country Director , called for more collaboration between philanthropic organizations and other stakeholders to successfully address the vast challenges defined by the SDGs .
“ Achieving the SDGs will require a radical increase in innovations , private sector solutions to social problems , and the adoption of a whole of society approach . Diverse forms of philanthropic giving can drive resource mobilization for the implementation of the SDGs , '' noted Ms. Welch .
Also at the report launch was the Vice President of Rockefeller Philanthropy Advisors , Heather Grady who shared insights from a study report on “ Scaling Solutions Towards Shifting Systems , ” which was commissioned by the Skoll Foundation and a Steering Group composed of Porticus , Ford , and Draper Richards Kaplan Foundations . Ms. Grady encouraged funders to work in more collaborative ways to achieve system level changes and maximum impact .
The Enabling Environment for Philanthropy in Ghana Report outlines the different streams of giving , captures the history and culture of philanthropy in Ghana , and examines the existing frameworks and how these could create a disabling environment for philanthropy in some areas . Based on the findings , the context and lessons from other countries , the report provides recommendations including the need for policy formulation on philanthropy and capacity development of philanthropy networks to encourage increased partnerships between philanthropic organizations and the public sector towards inclusive growth .
Participants of the report launch came from a cross-section of organizations ranging from government agencies , Foundations , NGOs , and private sector . Key organizations present included Beige Foundation , Africa Women 's Development Fund , Newmont Ghana , Reach for Change , Social Enterprise Ghana , CSO Platform on the Sustainable Development Goals , Camfed Ghana , Department of Social Welfare , Ministry of Sanitation and Water Resources , STAR-Ghana , IDP Foundation , Care International , UMB Foundation , WaterAid , Safe Water Network , World Vision , National Development Planning Commission , MBC Africa , among others .

HYDERABAD , Jul 04 ( APP ) : The Grand Democratic Alliance 's ( GDA ) General Secretary Ayaz Palijo has denied that an election alliance has been formed between the GDA and Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan ( MQM-P ) .
“ The GDA has n't entered in any electoral coalition with MQM-P . Even a proposal in this regard was never submitted before the alliance 's supreme council for consideration , ” they clarified in a press release issued here on Wednesday .
The GDA 's reaction comes after a recent meeting between former MNA Pir Sadaruddin Shah Rashdi of Pakistan Muslim League-Functional and MQM-P 's leaders Khalid Maqbool Siddiqi and Amir Khan in Karachi .
Palijo said the GDA was an alliance of several political parties each of which was at liberty for making local level seat adjustments with any party which was not part of the GDA .
They elaborated that even all the candidates contesting on the GDA 's tickets were free to make the adjustments on the constituencies ' level .
Palijo accused Pakistan Peoples Party 's ( PPP ) media team for allegedly spreading false stories with the intent to damage reputation of the GDA and its leaders .
They alleged that PPP was spending hundreds of million on its propaganda squad .
They reminded the people that PPP was the first party in Sindh which took MQM-P in the coalition government in 1988 .
The GDA 's leader asked the people of Sindh not to fall pray to alleged disinformation campaign of the PPP .
NEW DELHI ( Reuters ) - Russia threw its weight behind China 's massive Belt and Road plan to build trade and transport links across Asia and beyond , suggesting to India on Monday that it find a way to work with Beijing on the signature project . Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov ( L ) Indian Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj ( C ) and Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi shake hands before the start of their meeting in New Delhi , India , December 11 , 2017 . REUTERS/Adnan AbidiIndia is strongly opposed to an economic corridor that China is building in Pakistan that runs through disputed Kashmir as part of the Belt and Road initiative . India was the only country that stayed away from a May summit hosted by Chinese President Xi Jinping to promote the plan to build railways , ports and power grids in a modern-day recreation of the Silk Road . Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said New Delhi should not let political problems deter it from joining the project , involving billions of dollars of investment , and benefiting from it . Lavrov was speaking in the Indian capital after a three-way meeting with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi and Indian Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj at which , they said , India 's reservations over the Chinese project were discussed . “ I know India has problems , we discussed it today , with the concept of One Belt and One Road , but the specific problem in this regard should not make everything else conditional to resolving political issues , ” they said . Russia , all the countries in central Asia , and European nations had signed up to the Chinese project to boost economic cooperation , they said . “ Those are the facts , ” they said . “ India , I am 100 percent convinced , has enough very smart diplomats and politicians to find a way which would allow you to benefit from this process. ” The comments by Russia , India 's former Cold War ally , reflected the differences within the trilateral grouping formed 15 years ago to challenge U.S.-led dominance of global affairs . But substantial differences between India and China , mainly over long-standing border disputes , have snuffed out prospects of any real cooperation among the three . India , in addition , has drawn closer to the United States in recent years , buying weapons worth billions of dollars to replace its largely Soviet-origin military . Swaraj said the three countries had very productive talks on economic issues and the fight against terrorism .

WASHINGTON The Trump administration on Wednesday moved to amend the starting date of its proposed 90-day travel ban on people entering the United States from six Muslim-majority countries in a bid to keep its legal battle alive.The amendment appears intended to avoid the administration 's legal case at the U.S. Supreme Court becoming moot on grounds that parts of the executive order have expired.Challengers to the ban , who say the order is intended to discriminate against Muslims , have said in court papers that it should expire on Wednesday , 90 days after the executive order was due to take effect on March 16.A memo issued by the White House , as the Supreme Court considered two challenges to the ban , said parts of the order put on hold would not expire before they can go into effect , and the start date would be when court injunctions were lifted.The move is part of administration efforts to have the high court rule that the controversial ban should immediately go into effect after Trump 's first attempts to impose travel restrictions were blocked by lower courts .
Omar Jadwat , a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union , which has challenged the ban , said the need for the revision was a sign of the ban 's legal flaws . `` And yet again , these revisions underline that the one thing the president has consistently wanted throughout is a Muslim ban , '' they added.Lawsuits by Hawaii and Maryland challengers argued that the order violated federal immigration law and a section of the Constitution 's First Amendment , which prohibits the government favouring or disfavouring any particular religion . The Trump administration has said it is needed to protect national security .
Soon after the memo was issued , Acting Solicitor General Jeff Wall filed court papers saying that it resolved `` any doubt '' about the order 's effective date . If the case was moot , the nine justices would have no reason to rule on it and lower court rulings against the administration would remain in place.The Supreme Court on Tuesday gave the Trump administration more time to file papers responding to an appeals court ruling on Monday that upheld a block on the travel ban .
The court 's action likely delayed any decision on administration requests for the ban to go into effect until at least next week . Federal judges in Maryland and Hawaii blocked Trump 's 90-day ban on travellers from Libya , Iran , Somalia , Sudan , Syria and Yemen . The Hawaii judge also blocked a 120-day ban on refugees entering the United States.The 9th U.S . Circuit Court of Appeals largely upheld the Hawaii injunction on Monday.In the second case , the Richmond , Virginia-based 4th U.S . Circuit Court of Appeals , on May 25 upheld the Maryland judge 's ruling . ( Reporting by Lawrence Hurley ; Editing by Andrew Hay and Jonathan Oatis )

The Central Tigers ( 1-4 , 0-2 Central ) deploy an aggressive defense . They play man coverage on the outside , which frees up their linebackers to blitz . The offensive line will have to play well to pick up the blitzers , but the quarterback will need to make good decisions with rushers in their face .
“ They like to blitz their linebackers and be aggressive , and try to keep you in bad situations , ” James said . “ They 've got a lot of athleticism . They 've got a really good defensive end . Their linebackers are athletic and do a good job . And they 're long on defense . ”
The Hornets ( 5-0 , 2-0 ) defense will need to play sound football to keep the Central offense in check . James calls their offense a spread run .
“ That 's what they 're doin ' , ” James said . “ I mean , they throw it a little bit , but they 're basically spreadin ' the field to run it . That 's what they wan na do . They 'll throw screens and short passes . The D-line 's got ta play well . They 'll have a bunch of 50-50 balls and we 've got ta win those . The secondary will be in a lot of one-on-one situations , so our D-line and our linebackers have got ta play well . ”
James said that the Tigers play well at home . He 's telling their team to expect that team on Friday . Some teams might get complacent , but the Hornets tend to stay on an even keel and treat each week like a new season .
Kickoff is 7 p.m. at Quigley Stadium in Little Rock and the game can be heard on 93.7 FM/690 AM .

NEW DELHI ( Reuters ) - India on Wednesday raised the government-mandated price for summer-sown crops such as rice and cotton by the most since Prime Minister Narendra Modi came to power in 2014 , as they look to woo millions of poor farmers ahead of a general election next year .

The country announces support prices for more than a dozen crops each year to set a benchmark . But analysts say the median hike this year was 25 percent compared with 3-4 percent in the last three years , which could hit government finances and stoke inflation .
“ The government is committed to realising the vision of doubling farmers ' income by 2022 , towards which it is working on a comprehensive strategy , ” Radha Mohan Singh , the minister for agriculture and farmers ' welfare , said in a statement after a meeting of Modi 's cabinet .
Rural India voted overwhelmingly for Modi 's Bharatiya Janata Party four years ago to hand them the biggest mandate in 30 years . But a crash in commodity prices has meant their immense popularity in the countryside has waned over the past few months .
The government , however , said on Wednesday the latest hike in the so-called minimum support prices ( MSPs ) would help farmers increase their income and boost the economy .

The total cost to the government would be 150 billion rupees ( $ 2.18 billion ) , Home Minister Rajnath Singh , themselves a farmer , told reporters , adding that it would be wrong to say inflation would increase due to the hike .
Though the government announces MSPs for most crops , state agencies buy only rice and wheat at those prices given a lack of financial resources , limiting the benefit of higher crop prices to only 7 percent of the country 's farmers .
“ Should the government rely on large-scale procurement of crops to implement these prices , then the fiscal cost could be around 0.3 percent of GDP ( gross domestic product ) , which will likely be shared by the central and state governments , ” said A. Prasanna , chief economist at ICICI Securities Primary Dealership in Mumbai .
The government said prices paid to local farmers for common grade paddy rice will be raised by 13 percent from a year ago to 1,750 rupees ( $ 25.50 ) per 100 kg for the year starting on July 1 . Last year , the government raised the rice price by 5.4 percent .
“ The impact from these MSP hikes will be 35 basis points to headline inflation in the current fiscal year , and another 35 bps in the next , ” said Shubhada Rao , chief economist at Yes Bank .
Analysts and economists have warned the move could prompt India 's central bank to raise interest rates more steeply than expected .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Ascension Health and Providence St. Joseph Health are in talks about a merger between the two Catholic non-profits that would create the largest U.S. hospital chain , the Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday , citing people familiar with the discussions .
A deal between St. Louis-based Ascension and Renton , Washington-based Providence would give the combined entity 191 hospitals in 27 states and annual revenue of $ 44.8 billion , the Journal reported . That would surpass the current largest U.S. hospital operator , HCA Healthcare Inc ( HCA.N ) , a for-profit company .
Providence declined to comment on the report . Ascension did not respond to a request for comment .
The two have been in talks about a deal for months but have not reached an agreement , the Journal reported . The paper said that unlike for-profit companies , mergers of nonprofit hospital operators do not typically involve one entity buying the other .
The merger talks come at a pivotal time in the industry , as a series of deals , major changes to the 2010 Affordable Care Act , dubbed Obamacare , and rising drug prices have reshaped the U.S. healthcare landscape .
Last week , Catholic Health Initiatives CAHEA.UL and Dignity Health announced that they had signed a definitive agreement to align their organizations . The merger would result in the formation of a large and diverse Catholic health system .
On Dec. 3 , CVS Health Corp ( CVS.N ) and Aetna Inc ( AET.N ) proposed a $ 69 billion merger , arguing it would enable the companies to tackle soaring healthcare spending by offering lower-cost medical services in pharmacies . That deal , the year 's largest , would combine one of the nation 's biggest pharmacy benefits managers and pharmacy operators with one of its oldest health insurers .
MILFORD , Conn. ( AP ) — Authorities say four students were taken to the hospital after apparently being overcome by heat from stage lights during chorus practice at a Connecticut high school .
According to a statement from Milford schools , students from the city 's two high schools and three middle schools were practicing Monday morning at Foran High School for an upcoming concert when four of them fainted and several others said they felt ill .
In addition to the four brought to the hospital , six students were released to their parents .
The school said “ it is believed the students fell ill due to overheating while standing on risers under the stage lights . ”
Fire officials say about 200 students were in the auditorium at the time .
All the students are expected to be OK .

Tue , Feb 14 : The Nova Scotia government will impose a wage pattern on teachers that was previously rejected in the first and second tentative agreements .
The state 's largest grower of peaches and other fruit bargained in bad faith with the United Farm Workers of America and wrongly tried to exclude as many as 1,500 employees from a collective bargaining agreement , a judge has ruled .
The decision gives a strong boost to the UFW 's claim to represent as many as 6,500 workers at Gerawan Farming Inc. , a 12,000-acre farm and packing operation in the San Joaquin Valley that has been the focal point of one of the longest-running and most acrimonious labor dispute in decades .
The decision also reaffirms that employees of labor contractors , who now provide about half the workers who pick the state 's crops , are covered by union contracts signed with the grower .
The Gerawan-UFW fight , which began in the early 1990s , has sparked the single largest effort to decertify a union , along with a flurry of labor board and court decisions , including one that has stalled the state 's ability to impose a contract on warring parties .
And these parties have been at war , Administrative Law Judge William L. Schmidt acknowledged in a decision issued Friday .
Co-owner Dan Gerawan 's undisguised anger with the union , Schmidt wrote , “ appears deep and unusually long-lasting , ” and “ perhaps explains the motive underlying the current expenditure of what must have been enormous sums by the Gerawan enterprises opposing the UFW and seeking to rid itself of any legal obligation to deal with that organization . ”
Gerawan showed “ at most , a lackadaisical attitude … and at worst , complete hostility ” and “ almost certainly guaranteed ” a mediator would have to step in and impose a contract in 2013 , Schmidt wrote .
Armando Elenes , a spokesperson for the UFW , said the decision “ confirms what we 've been saying all along — Gerawan has been undermining the law . They 're trying to undermine the state of California . ”
Gerawan 's lead attorney , David Schwarz , blasted the decision and promised an appeal — none of the previous decisions in the case has gone without appeals from the growers and the Agricultural Labor Relations Board .
“ Gerawan is confident that these undemocratic decisions will not stand , and will challenge this latest erroneous ruling , ” Schwarz said Monday . They accused the judge of blaming the grower for the union 's “ unexplained , 17-year absence ” from Gerawan 's fields .
Schmidt 's ruling appears to undermine Gerawan 's assertion that the union abandoned their workers in the mid-1990s before returning in 2012 to demand the right to negotiate a new contract . Gerawan has argued that UFW was solely looking to pad its membership and coffers — it collects dues of 3 % of each member 's gross pay — by deliberately running out the clock on negotiations so it could obtain a contract imposed by a mediator .
Workers faced with those dues petitioned to hold an election to decertify the UFW — a stinging irony for the union founded by Cesar Chavez to obtain humane treatment of farmworkers . Union membership , once as high as 70,000 , has fallen to just over 7,000 .
Ballots from the 2013 decertification election never were counted , and last year the Agricultural Labor Relations Board — itself an outgrowth of Chavez 's labor movement — nullified the vote , saying Gerawan undermined the union by directly supporting an employee leading the ouster effort .
Schmidt ordered Gerawan to find and compensate employees for the eight-month period of bargaining impasse in 2013 , and to allow officials from the Agricultural Labor Relations Board to enter their property to explain the decision and discuss rights with their current workforce — sessions that are to be paid for by Gerawan . The grower also will have to mail the decision to workers and post it at work sites for 60 days , Schmidt ruled .
The ALRB will issue a decision based on the judge 's opinion . That decision can be appealed .

When chief executives take a leave of absence , it 's typically because they have a serious problem on their hands . So when Uber co-founder and CEO Travis Kalanick announced Tuesday that they were going on indefinite leave , people took notice .
Kalanick 's announcement came at a tumultuous time for Uber . Former U.S. Atty . Gen. Eric H. Holder Jr. had just wrapped up a months-long investigation into allegations of systemic sexual harassment , discrimination and bullying at the company . Holder 's firm , Covington & Burling , had made 47 recommendations on how Uber could address its toxic culture .
Kalanick 's move signaled a shift in the company 's too big- , too hot- and too-innovative-to-fail attitude . It was an admission that as CEO they had to bear some of the responsibility for the mess in which Uber now found itself .
But their leave of absence means a lot more , business and management experts said .
What does it mean for a CEO to go on leave ?
When CEOs go on leave , it means that they 're taking a break from their day-to-day duties and that others will step in to perform their roles . It 's different from taking a vacation because it signals that the executive , for whatever reason , is unable to effectively do their or their job at that point in time .
One of the more common reasons for executives taking a leave of absence is health issues , said David Mayer , a professor at the University of Michigan 's Ross School of Business .
Steve Jobs , for example , took multiple leaves of absence from Apple when they were receiving cancer treatment . Patrick Byrne , chief executive of Overstock.com , went on indefinite leave last year because of hepatitis C complications . They returned three months later .
“ Another reason a CEO might go on leave is because there are performances or ethical issues , ” Mayer said .
David Baazov , who was chief executive of online gambling company Amaya , took an indefinite leave of absence in March 2016 after they were accused of insider trading . They resigned from the company five months later .
Kalanick has not given a timeline for when they expect to be back .
Why would a board of directors puts an executive on leave instead of just firing them or her ?
Putting an executive on leave does n't necessarily mean that a board of directors has lost faith in that person , said Micah Alpern , an organizational and leadership expert at A.T. Kearney .
“ It could be that there are things going on in their personal life , that they 're distracted and are not able to manage right now , ” Alpern said . “ It does n't signify that they do n't think they 're the right person to run the company in the long term . ”
In Kalanick 's case , they cited their mother 's recent death in a boating accident as the reason for wanting to take time off .
One possible reason for putting Kalanick on ice instead of firing them is that Kalanick and their allies on the board — Garrett Camp , Uber 's co-founder , and Ryan Graves , senior vice president of operations — reportedly have disproportionate voting rights that would make it difficult for other board members to oust him .
But even if the board could fire Kalanick , Silicon Valley has shown a reluctance to get rid of founders who are perceived to be the secret sauce to a company 's success .
“ Travis explained their vision to me of a future where no one owned a car , there was no need for parking lots , less congestion , fewer accidents , fewer DUIs , ” said Bradley Tusk , founder of Tusk Strategies , who has worked with Kalanick and Uber in the past , but is not a member of the company 's board . “ That was back in 2011 . It 's just as cogent and accurate of a vision today as it was then . Not having them driving the vision would be a mistake . ”

What are the benefits to putting the CEO on leave ?
First , it 's good symbolism , according to Alpern , who said it sends a strong message to employees and the public that the company is serious about changing .
But it 's also an opportunity for the executive to reflect , to undergo leadership training and for the company to implement changes without the distraction of a beleaguered CEO .
“ The CEO is typically the leader that the culture of an organization is anchored around , ” said Gary Mangiofico of the Pepperdine Graziadio School of Business and Management . “ So if they want to see a culture shift in the organization , they have to dislodge that anchor , if you will , in order for people to even believe there 's a possibility things will change . ”
Are there any downsides ?
In Uber 's case , not having a second in command step up to fill Kalanick 's shoes while they are away could create uncertainty at the company , Mangiofico said .
The firm is currently without a chief operating officer , a chief marketing officer , a chief financial officer , a head of engineering or general counsel . Kalanick 's duties will , instead , be spread among the 14 people who report directly to him .
“ Without a central leadership figure , the vision of a company can start to become fuzzy , ” Mangiofico said . “ And if that happens , the strategy potentially begins to break down . ”
The indefinite nature of Kalanick 's leave of absence could also hurt morale , Alpern said .
“ An employee is sitting there thinking , I can focus on my job , but they 're also going to think about what 's going to happen to our role or our policies ? What will it be like to work here ? ”
So what happens when Kalanick comes back ?
In Holder 's report , the top recommendation was for the company to review and reallocate some of Kalanick 's responsibilities . This could mean that they return as a CEO who gets support from a newly hired COO . It could mean that they are moved into another role entirely .
Based on Kalanick 's talk about taking time off to reflect and work on himself , the expectation of investors and other stakeholders is likely to be that if they return , they will do so as a changed man .
“ There 's going to be a lot of skepticism around it , ” Mayer said . “ Employees and stakeholders will have their antennas up . ”
The company and its board will have to figure out a way to measure that change and to hold Kalanick accountable . Otherwise the Holder report and Kalanick 's leave of absence will just be lip service , business and management experts said .
“ Culture matters a lot , and over time it has a significant impact not just on the people but on the bottom line , ” said Jim Barnett , co-founder of human resources platform Glint . “ Companies that fail to create inclusive environments where people feel a sense of belonging will struggle to succeed in the new work world . ”

The Young Americans for Freedom ( YAF ) club on the DU campus brought a guest speaker to discuss “ political incorrectness ” on Wednesday , April 12 .
Matt Rhodes , the president of YAF , introduced Justin Longo as the speaker to provide an “ alternative point to [ the DU ] campus that desperately needs it. ” Longo is a dual degree graduate in business management and economics from George Mason University and works at the Independence Institute in Denver . To set the mood , speakers filled Lindsay Auditorium with Eminem , NWA and the Sex Pistols and for eight minutes , the crowd 's whispers words to chants of “ this is weird . ”
Justifying the music choices , Longo stated that each artist participated in their or their personal form of rebellion against an oppressive system . Just like how NWA 's “ F * ck Tha Police ” was a rebel yell against police brutality against African Americans , Young Americans for Freedom stated that they promote open dialogue that resists the oppressive PC ( political correctness ) on [ college campuses . ]
“ We should have tolerance for all kinds of speech even hateful , bigoted speech , ” said Longo . “ [ You ] flesh out what ideas are good and what ideas are bad overtime . Then society learns by having the public discussion , and as that society evolves , that creates the conditions of political will to form the legislation that we want . ”
Longo argued their reasoning behind free speech through four points in support of practicing political incorrectness : being offended is how we learn , without free speech , ideas can not be applied to the scientific method , hate speech is a minority 's best friend and limiting free speech would eventually lead to violence .
“ Being offended is how we learn , ” Longo said . “ If we ca n't be offended and criticize ideas we can not figure out what ideas , are good and what ideas are bad . We ca n't learn from one another . ”
According to Longo , besides religion , everything else must be debated . They say that knowledge and truth break through our mental barriers and that offense should be promoted , for it is how ideas can change . If we stop the conversation when someone is offended , then we stop the pursuit of truth .
While their speaking style was scattered , Longo did articulate why they thought it was safer to not limit free speech , saying that it protects the minority opinion .
“ Laws against hate speech keep hate in the shadows , ” said Longo . “ Let people expose their beliefs . I would like to know if the coffee shop owner is a bigot so I can never go there again . ”
They followed that up by saying that moments of conflict between ideologies allow the minority within the discussion to correct flaws in the attacking argument as well as change the opponent 's mindset .
Their final argument was that it should be the ideas that are attacked , not the person because ideas should be exposed .
“ Let 's kill each other 's hypothesis , not each other , ” said Longo .
The lecture ended with a question and answer session that eventually turned into the crowd scolding and laughing during the answer portions . However , Longo did not really answer any of the questions that were directed at him , frequently answering with sarcasm . Rhodes proved to be more successful at responding .
The event ended with a discussion of pasta , individuals yelling at the audience before leaving the auditorium and people throwing and destroying the foam middle fingers that had been provided at the beginning of the event . No future events were mentioned .
A group of student activists held a meeting in Sturm immediately after the YAF event to discuss and debrief .

Re : Where will Canadians buy their marijuana ? , April 15
Where will Canadians buy their marijuana ? , April 15
I applaud the move to legalize recreational marijuana . It was made illegal decades ago without any health studies that deemed it harmful , and since we 've learned that marijuana is far less harmful than tobacco or alcohol , both legal .
There 's no reason to treat marijuana differently than we treat booze and cigarettes . Most opposition to this is based on decades of propaganda that linked marijuana to hard , addictive drugs like heroin , which is laughable .
You can not overdose on marijuana , and there 's never been a death linked to merely smoking pot . It is not physically addictive , and its psychological effects tend to make people more passive and agreeable , which is why you never hear about marijuana-related violence , except as it relates to the black market sales .
Shania Twain is from Canada , so she 's not a U.S. citizen . But if they were , they would 've voted for Donald Trump back in 2016 . This is from a new interview with “ The Guardian . ”
They said , quote , “ I would have voted for them because , even though they were offensive , they seemed honest . Do you want straight or polite ? Not that you should n't be able to have both .
“ If I were voting , I just do n't want [ B.S . ] I would have voted for a feeling that it was transparent . And politics has a reputation of not being that , right ? ”
The Internet blew up over the weekend with people calling them out , so they backtracked and started apologizing . In a series of Tweets they said the question caught them off guard and they regretted them answer .
They said they were trying to point out that candidate Trump was someone people could relate to because they were not a politician . They added that she , quote , “ does n't hold common moral beliefs with the current President . ”
Hmmm , what do you think about this ? Should they have apologized ? Sounds off in the comments below .
ISLAMABAD - Pakistan Army said yesterday that country has made considerable progress in the betterment of the security situation and announced surrender of a high-profile Taliban leader .
A key leader of the defunct Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan ( TTP ) Ehsanullah Ehsan has voluntarily surrendered to the security forces of Pakistan , said Inter-Services Public Relations ( ISPR ) chief Maj-Gen Asif Ghafoor .
The director general of military 's media wing told a press conference that the people of Pakistan and the state institutions have turned the tables on the terrorists .
They said that the state is re-establishing its writ and no element can challenge writ of the state if the state has the will to weed out dangerous elements .
ISPR DG said 15 major operations were conducted across the country as part of the ongoing Raddul Fasaad military operation .
“ The army performed two big operations in Punjab , one in Sindh , four in Balochistan and eight in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa . ”
They said that “ 4,535 intelligence-based operations ( IBOs ) have been conducted while 723 joint check-posts were established in coordination with the police ” .
They added that security forces recovered over 4,083 weapons , and over 500 absconders have surrendered since the launch of the military offensive .
Ghafoor said : “ I want to take this opportunity to announce that Ehsanullah Ehsan , the former spokesperson of the TTP and a leader of the Jamaat-ul-Ahrar , has surrendered themselves to our security agencies .
“ There can be no bigger achievement for Pakistan than the fact that our biggest enemies are now realising the error of their ways and are turning themselves in .
“ We have progressed to the point that the people who 've been planning attacks on Pakistan 's soil from across the border have started to see that the situation has changed… We hope others would also follow Ehsan 's suite . ”
The development comes in the wake of Pakistan 's demand from Afghanistan to take action against 76 leaders of a number of terrorist outfits affiliated with the TTP who had fled into Afghanistan to evade Pakistan 's military operations .
Pakistan shared the list with Afghanistan in February this year after a series of terrorist attacks across the country which claimed more than 100 innocent lives .
Ehsanullah Ehsan after their reported split with TTP had joined Jamaat-ul-Ahrar in 2014 , as a spokesperson of the newly formed terrorist outfit Jamaat-ul-Ahrar which claimed responsibility of Lahore 's Mall Road terrorist attack in February which claimed thirteen lives including senior police officers while over 100 were injured in the attack .
Dasesh girl
ISPR DG also showed the recorded confessional statement of Naureen Leghari , a medical student from Hyderabad who had allegedly fled home to join the militant Islamic State ( IS ) in Syria .
“ The girl went missing from Hyderabad . Later , a message appeared on Facebook in which they said that they had joined the military group , ” the director general said before they showed the video .
They said that Chief of Army Staff General Qamar javed Bajwa instructed the DG Military Intelligence ( MI ) to recover the girl which is our own child .
In the video , Leghari denied that they had been kidnapped , saying they made the decision to travel to Lahore on their own .
“ I am a second-year student at the Liaquat Medical University , ” Leghari said in the video .
“ I went to Lahore on my own , no one kidnapped me , ” they said .
“ Our main plan was to carry out terrorist activities , ” they said . “ These included suicide attacks and kidnapping intelligence officials , ” they claimed .
“ A young man named Fauji was involved in these activities . ”
They said that Naureen returned to Lahore three weeks ago and was being tracked by security personnel . “ Law enforcement agencies are investigating them as well ” .
Naureem was arrested on Friday after their husband , whom they had married after leaving their home and joining the militants , was killed in an encounter in Punjab Housing Society .
Youth bulge is our strength
After playing Leghari 's confession , Maj Gen Ghafoor said Pakistan 's youth bulge — a term for the large percentage of Pakistan 's population that comprises young men and women — was becoming a target for terrorist outfits .
“ The youth bulge is our strength , ” Ghafoor said . “ When the terrorists target our youth , you can imagine the impact it will have on Pakistan . ”
“ Naureen made the claim that they are going to Syria to join ISIS via Facebook while still residing in Lahore , showing us how technology is misused . It is our responsibility as a nation to make sure that our children are not misguided and lured into such activities , ” Ghafoor said .
“ The youth is the nation 's collective responsibility ; families and friends need to make sure that the youth is not led astray online , ” they said .
“ Threats like the TTP are physical in nature and can be dealt with force ; but the threat present online needs to be dealt with by families , ” they added .
The spokesperson also detailed the social measures being undertaken to eliminate extremism from the country . They spoke of measures taken to make education and the armed forces more inclusive for people from Balochistan , Fata and Gilgit Baltistan .
Raddul Fasaad updates
Updates on Operation Raddul Fasaad were a major focus of the Army 's Monday briefing .
Maj Gen Asif Ghafoor said the Frontier Corps , Balochistan had conducted an intelligence-based operation on April 15 , during which prepared explosives were recovered .
In Fata on April 16 , two major operations were conducted during which a large cache of weapons was recovered from the Kurram and Orakzai agencies .
“ In Sindh , operations are underway . Operations being conducted in Karachi are slightly different . Year after year , target killings and crime rate in Karachi have been decreasing , ” they said .
Fixing western border
“ Another aspect of Raddul Fasaad was to bring stability to the western border , ” Ghafoor said .
“ A small area in Fata - Rajgaal , Khyber Agency and Shawal is yet to be cleared . An operation will be carried out when the weather improves , they added .
The Army 's spokesperson also said that the Army , along with the FC , has started to build checkposts and new forts along the border .
“ 338 check posts and forts will be built along the Pak-Afghan border by 2019 . 42 have already been made , whereas work is on-going on another 63 , ” they said .
“ We are fencing the Pak-Afghan border in KP , and we will also fence the border in Balochistan , ” they said .
“ Border management with Afghanistan is the most important issue , ” Ghafoor later said .
“ Pakistan is a sovereign state : we are putting the fence up within the limits of Pakistan and we are free to do so . And even though some elements are criticising the move , serious stakeholders in Afghanistan understand that the border is going to help Afghanistan as much as it is going to help us , ” they added .
‘ Do more ' thing of past
Answering a question about the US rhetoric asking Pakistan to do more they said there used to be a loud ‘ do more ' rhetoric in the past , but with each passing day , the notion is dying down .
“ This needs to be acknowledged . The elements of the international community that matter acknowledge Pakistan 's contribution . What other country in the world has fought terrorism the way we have ? The international community acknowledges our efforts , ” they said .
Indian spy
Answering a question about the fate of Indian spy operative Gulbushan jadhav they said Maj Gen Ghafoor said they have been sentenced to death on the basis of undeniable evidence and a after a lawful procedure .
“ He is being dealt under the law ” , they added .
Commenting on India 's unprovoked firing across the LoC , they said that there has been an increase in ceasefire violations along the Line of Control .
“ The reason behind this is that India is attempting to divert attention away from the political uprising in India-held Kashmir , ” they said .
“ In 2014 , 315 ceasefire violations were reported ; 248 in 2015 ; 380 in 2016 ; and in 2017 , as of April , there have already been 222 ceasefire violations , ” they said .
Census
“ Pakistan Army has taken a supportive role in the ongoing census , ” Ghafoor said .
“ With every civilian enumerator , we have attached a representative of Pak Army , ” they said .
“ I want to thank the country here for the love they have given to the Army representatives when they come to their homes , ” they said .
The Army 's spokesperson said Phase 1 of the census was over and that the second phase would commence from April 25 and continue for a month ,
“ Phase 1 was completed In Punjab , Sindh and Balochistan ; however there are 14 blocks in Orakzai agency that were not completed on time due to the return of internally-displaced persons , ” they said . “ Likewise , in Jammu and Kashmir , there are 15 blocks that are yet to be completed . ”
Ghafoor also paid tribute to the officers who lost their lives when a census team was attacked in Lahore , but added that “ these incidents will not halt the population census ” .

Naureem was arrested on Friday after their husband , whom they had married after leaving their home and joining the militants , was killed in an encounter in Punjab Housing Society .
Youth bulge is our strength
After playing Leghari 's confession , Maj Gen Ghafoor said Pakistan 's youth bulge — a term for the large percentage of Pakistan 's population that comprises young men and women — was becoming a target for terrorist outfits .
“ The youth bulge is our strength , ” Ghafoor said . “ When the terrorists target our youth , you can imagine the impact it will have on Pakistan . ”
“ Naureen made the claim that they are going to Syria to join ISIS via Facebook while still residing in Lahore , showing us how technology is misused . It is our responsibility as a nation to make sure that our children are not misguided and lured into such activities , ” Ghafoor said .
“ The youth is the nation 's collective responsibility ; families and friends need to make sure that the youth is not led astray online , ” they said .
“ Threats like the TTP are physical in nature and can be dealt with force ; but the threat present online needs to be dealt with by families , ” they added .
The spokesperson also detailed the social measures being undertaken to eliminate extremism from the country . They spoke of measures taken to make education and the armed forces more inclusive for people from Balochistan , Fata and Gilgit Baltistan .
Raddul Fasaad
updates
Updates on Operation Raddul Fasaad were a major focus of the Army 's Monday briefing .
Maj Gen Asif Ghafoor said the Frontier Corps , Balochistan had conducted an intelligence-based operation on April 15 , during which prepared explosives were recovered .
In Fata on April 16 , two major operations were conducted during which a large cache of weapons was recovered from the Kurram and Orakzai agencies .
“ In Sindh , operations are underway . Operations being conducted in Karachi are slightly different . Year after year , target killings and crime rate in Karachi have been decreasing , ” they said .
Fixing western
border
“ Another aspect of Raddul Fasaad was to bring stability to the western border , ” Ghafoor said .
“ A small area in Fata - Rajgaal , Khyber Agency and Shawal is yet to be cleared . An operation will be carried out when the weather improves , they added .
The Army 's spokesperson also said that the Army , along with the FC , has started to build checkposts and new forts along the border .
“ 338 check posts and forts will be built along the Pak-Afghan border by 2019 . 42 have already been made , whereas work is on-going on another 63 , ” they said .
“ We are fencing the Pak-Afghan border in KP , and we will also fence the border in Balochistan , ” they said .
“ Border management with Afghanistan is the most important issue , ” Ghafoor later said .
“ Pakistan is a sovereign state : we are putting the fence up within the limits of Pakistan and we are free to do so . And even though some elements are criticising the move , serious stakeholders in Afghanistan understand that the border is going to help Afghanistan as much as it is going to help us , ” they added .
‘ Do more ' thing
of past
Answering a question about the US rhetoric asking Pakistan to do more they said there used to be a loud ‘ do more ' rhetoric in the past , but with each passing day , the notion is dying down .
“ This needs to be acknowledged . The elements of the international community that matter acknowledge Pakistan 's contribution . What other country in the world has fought terrorism the way we have ? The international community acknowledges our efforts , ” they said .
Indian spy
Answering a question about the fate of Indian spy operative Gulbushan jadhav they said Maj Gen Ghafoor said they have been sentenced to death on the basis of undeniable evidence and a after a lawful procedure .
“ He is being dealt under the law ” , they added .
Commenting on India 's unprovoked firing across the LoC , they said that there has been an increase in ceasefire violations along the Line of Control .
“ The reason behind this is that India is attempting to divert attention away from the political uprising in India-held Kashmir , ” they said .
“ In 2014 , 315 ceasefire violations were reported ; 248 in 2015 ; 380 in 2016 ; and in 2017 , as of April , there have already been 222 ceasefire violations , ” they said .
Census
“ Pakistan Army has taken a supportive role in the ongoing census , ” Ghafoor said .
“ With every civilian enumerator , we have attached a representative of Pak Army , ” they said .
“ I want to thank the country here for the love they have given to the Army representatives when they come to their homes , ” they said .
The Army 's spokesperson said Phase 1 of the census was over and that the second phase would commence from April 25 and continue for a month ,
“ Phase 1 was completed In Punjab , Sindh and Balochistan ; however there are 14 blocks in Orakzai agency that were not completed on time due to the return of internally-displaced persons , ” they said . “ Likewise , in Jammu and Kashmir , there are 15 blocks that are yet to be completed . ”
Ghafoor also paid tribute to the officers who lost their lives when a census team was attacked in Lahore , but added that “ these incidents will not halt the population census ” .

Memorandum , ? which is attached to this letter ) . As provided by clause 11 ( g ) of Rule of the House of Representatives , the Committee has forwarded this Memorandum to the President based on its determination that the release of the Memorandum would serve the public interest . The Constitution vests the President with the authority to protect national security secrets from its disclosure . As the Supreme Court has recognized , it is the President ? s responsibility to classify , declassify , and control access to information bearing on our intelligence sources and methods and national defense . See , Dep of Navy v. Egan , 484 US . 518 , 527 ( 1988 ) . In order to facilitate appropriate congressional oversight , the Executive Branch may entrust classi ? ed information to the appropriate committees of Congress , as it has done in connection with the Committee ? s oversight activities here . The Executive Branch does so on the assumption that the Committee will responsibly protect such classi ? ed information , consistent with the laws of the United States . The Committee has now determined that the release of the Memorandum would be appropriate . The Executive Branch , across Administrations of both parties , has worked to accommodate congressional requests to declassify speci ? c materials in the public interest.1 However , public release of classi ? ed information by unilateral action of the Legislative Branch is extremely rare and raises signi ? cant separation of powers concerns . Accordingly , the Committee ? s request to release the Memorandum is interpreted as a request for declassi ? cation pursuant to the President ? s authority . The President understands that the protection of our national security represents their highest obligation . Accordingly , they have directed lawyers and national security staff to assess the 1 See , e. S. Rept . 114 ? 8 at 12 ( Administration of Barack Obama ) ( ? On April 3 , 2014 . . . the Committee agreed to send the revised Findings and Conclusions , and the updated Executive Summary of the Committee Study , to the President for declassi ? cation and public release ? ) ; H. Rept . 107-792 ( Administration of George W. Bush ) ( similar ) ; E.O . 12812 ( Administration of George H.W . Bush ) ( noting Senate resolution requesting that President provide for declassi ? cation of certain information Via Executive Order ) .
declassi ? cation request , consistent with established standards governing the handling of classi ? ed information , including those under Section 3.1 ( d ) of Executive Order 13526 . Those standards permit declassi ? cation when the public interest in disclosure outweighs any need to protect the information . The White House review process also included input from the Of ? ce of the Director of National Intelligence and the Department of Justice . Consistent with this review and these standards , the President has determined that declassification of the Memorandum is appropriate . Based on this assessment and in light of the signi ? cant public interest in the memorandum , the President has authorized the declassi ? cation of the Memorandum . To be clear , the Memorandum re ? ects the judgments of its congressional authors . The President understands that oversight concerning matters related to the Memorandum may be continuing . Though the circumstances leading to the declassi ? cation through this process are extraordinary , the Executive Branch stands ready to work with Congress to accommodate oversight requests consistent with applicable standards and processes , including the need to protect intelligence sources and methods . Sincerely , Donald F. McGahn II Counsel to the President cc : The Honorable Paul Ryan Speaker of the House of Representatives The Honorable Adam Schiff Ranking Member , House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence
ssnua DeclasSi ? ed by order of the President February 2 , 2018 January 18 , 2018 To : HPSCI Majority Members From : HPSCI Majority Staff Subject : Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act Abuses at the Department of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation Purpose This memorandum provides Members an update on significant facts relating to the Committee ? s ongoing investigation into the Department of Justice ( DOJ ) and Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) and their use of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act ( F ISA ) during the 2016 presidential election cycle . Our ? ndings , which are detailed below , 1 ) raise concerns with the legitimacy and legality of certain DOJ and FBI interactions with the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court ( FISC ) , and 2 ) represent a troubling breakdown of legal processes established to protect the American people from abuses related to the ISA process . Investigation Update - On October 21 , 2016 , DOJ and FBI sought and received a ISA probable cause order ( up ; under Title VII ) authorizing electronic surveillance on Carter Page from the FISC . Page is a US citizen who served as a volunteer advisor to the Trump presidential campaign . Consistent . with requirements under FISA , the application had to be ? rst certi ? ed by the Director or Deputy Director of the FBI . It then required the approval of the Attorney General , Deputy Attorney General ( DAG ) , or the Senate ? con ? rmed Assistant Attorney General for the National Security Division . The FBI and DOJ obtained one initial FISA warrant targeting Carter Page and three FISA renewals from the FISC . As required by statute ( 50 U.S.C . a FISA order on an American citizen must be renewed by the ISC every 90 days and each renewal requires a separate finding of probable cause . Then-Director James Comey signed three FISA applications . in question on behalf of the FBI , and Deputy Director Andrew McCabe signed one . Sally Yates , then-Acting DAG Dana Boente , and DAG Rod Rosenstein each signed one or more FISA applications on behalf of Due to the sensitive nature of foreign intelligence activity , FISA submissions ( including renewals ) before the ISC are classified . As such , the public ? s con ? dence in the integrity of the FISA process depends on the court ? s ability to hold the government to the highest standard ? ? particularly as it relates to surveillance of American citizens . However , the rigor in protecting the rights of Americans , which is reinforced by 90 ? day renewals of surveillance orders , is necessarily dependent on the government ? s production to the court of all material and relevant facts . This should include information potentially favorable to the target of the FISA PROPERTY OF THE U.S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
TGIF-SEW application that is known by the government . In the case of Carter Page , the government had at least four independent opportunities before the FISC to accurately provide an accounting of the relevant facts . However , our ? ndings indicate that , as described below , material and relevant information was omitted . 1 ) 2 ) The ? dossier ? - compiled by Christopher Steele ( Steele dossier ) on behalf of the Democratic National Committee ( DNC ) and the Hillary Clinton campaign formed an essential part of the Carter Page FISA application . Steele was a longtime FBI source who was paid over $ 160,000 by the DNC and Clinton campaign , via the law ? rm Perkins Coie and research ? rm Fusion GPS , to obtain derogatory information on Donald Trump ? s ties to Russia . a ) Neither the initial application in October 2016 , nor any of the renewals , disclose or reference the role of the DNC , Clinton campaign , or . any party/campaign in funding Steele ? s efforts , even though the political origins of the Steele dossier were then known to senior and FBI of ? cials . b ) The initial FISA application notes Steele was working for a named US . person , but does not name Fusion GPS and principal Glenn Simpson , who was paid by a US . law ? rm ( Perkins Coie ) representing the DNC ( even though it was known by DOI at the , time that political actors were involved with the Steele dossier ) . The application does not mention Steele was ultimately working on behalf of ? and paid by ? wthe DNC and Clinton campaign , or that the FBI had separately authorized payment to Steele for the same information . The Carter Page FISA application also cited extensively a September 23 , 2016 , Yahoo News article by- Michael Isikoff , which focuses on Page ? s July 2016 trip to Moscow . - This article does not corroborate the Steele dossier because it is derived from information leaked by Steele themselves to Yahoo News . The Page FISA application incorrectly assesses that Steele did not directly provide information to Yahoo News . Steele has admitted in British court ? lings that they met with Yahoo Newly ? and several others . outlets ? in September 2016 at the direction of Fusion GPS . Perkins Coie was aware of Steele ? s initial media contacts because they hosted at least one meeting in Washington DC . in 2016 with Steele and Fusion GPS where this matter was discussed . '' a ) Steele was suspended and then terminated as an FBI source for what the FBI de ? nes as the most serious of violations ? an unauthorized disclosure to the media of their relationship with the FBI in an October 30 , 2016 , Mother Jones article by David Corn Steele should have been terminated for their previous undisclosed contacts with Yahoo and other outlets ' 1n September ? before the Page application was submitted to PROPERTY OF THE US . HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
3 ) 4 ) the FISC in October-but Steele improperly concealed from and lied to the FBI about those contacts . b ) Steele ? s numerous encounters with the media violated the cardinal rule of source handling ? maintaining con ? dentiality ? and demonstrated that Steele had become a less than reliable source for the FBI . Before and after Steele was terminated as a source , they maintained contact with DOJ via then-Associate Deputy Attorney General Bruce 0hr , a senior DOJ of ? cial who worked closely with Deputy Attorneys General Yates and later Rosenstein . Shortly after the election , the FBI began interviewing 0hr , documenting their communications with Steele . For example , in September 2016 , Steele admitted to 0hr their feelings against then- candidate Trump when Steele said they ? was desperate that Donald Trump not get elected and was passionate about them not , being president. ? This clear evidence of . Steele ? bias was recorded by Ohr at the time and subsequently in of ? cial FBI ? les ? but not re ? ected in any of the Page FISA applications . a ) During this same time period , Ohr ? s wife was employed by Fusion GPS to assist in the cultivation of opposition research on Trump . Ohr later provided the FBI with all of their wife ? s opposition research , paid for by the DNC and Clinton campaign via Fusion GPS . The Ohrs ? relationship with Steele and Fusion GPS was inexplicably concealed from the FISC . . According to the head of the counterintelligence division , Assistant Director Bill Priestap , corroboration of the Steele dossier was in its ? infancy ? at the time of the initial Page FISA application . After Steele was terminated , a source validation report conducted by an independent unit within FBI assessed Steele ? s reporting as only minimally corroborated . Yet , in early January 2017 , Director Comey briefed President-elect Trump on a summary of the Steele dossier , even though it was ? ? according to their June 2017 and unveri ? ed. ? While the FISA application relied on Steele ? s past record of credible reporting on other unrelated matters , it ignored or concealed their anti ? Trump ? nancial and ideological motivations . Furthermore , Deputy Director McCabe testi ? ed before the Committee in December 2017 that no surveillance warrant would have been sought from the FISC without the Steele dossier information . PROPERTY OF THE U.S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
5 ) The Page FISA application also mentions information regarding fellow Trump campaign advisor George Papadopoulos , but there is no evidence of any cooperation or conspiracy between Page and Papadopoulos . The Papadopoulos information triggered the opening of an FBI counterintelligence investigation in late July 2016 by FBI agent Pete Strzok . Strzok was reassigned by the Special Counsel ? s Office to FBI Human Resources for improper text messages with their mistress , FBI Attorney Lisa Page ( no known relation to Carter Page ) , where they both demonstrated a clear bias against Trump and in favor of Clinton , Whom Strzok had also investigated . The Strzok/Lisa Page texts also re ? ect extensive discussions about the investigation , orchestrating leaks to the media , and include a meeting with Deputy Director McCabe to discuss an ? insurance ? policy against President Trump ? s election .

Commentary : As of yesterday at midnight over 400,000 people registered overwhelming opposition to the Trump Administration 's evisceration of the BLM methane rules that would have drastically cut oil and gas waste and pollution . New Mexicans first participated in national listening sessions in support of this rule , then in public hearings on the rule and then commented in support of the final rule . Then thousands again commented against a proposed stay of the rule and have now , finally and once again , called on the Trump Administration to protect the community health and the public pocket book by leaving these rules in place .
`` Our members , friends and neighbors in New Mexico have stood up time again to call on the Trump Administration and industry to do right by our state . Industry has used its insider access to elected official to upend common-sense , good-neighbor rules that are health-improving , job-creating , and royalty increasing . This state produces half of all of the wasted methane in the country and we 're losing out on $ 27 million per year of royalty income for our state . That is unacceptable , but once again private profits ahead of the public interest under this Adminisration , '' said Camilla Feibelman , director of the Rio Grande Chapter of the Sierra Club .

Well , it 's been only about three weeks since the Trumpster took office , and if it was n't our country at stake , American politics would constitute a humorous soap opera . Already we 've had the Failed Mexican-Financed Wall , the overturned immigration orders , the realization that it wo n't be so easy after all to get rid of the Affordable Care Act , Nordstromgate ( with the U.S. Office of Government Ethics now asking the White House to investigate Kellyanne Conway for telling people to “ go buy Ivanka 's stuff ” ) , the resignation of national security advisor Michael Flynn , the new revelation that Trump aides had repeated contact with senior Russian intelligence officials before the election , the criticism of Trump 's attitude to the judiciary by their own nominee for the Supreme Court , the conversion of the Mar-a-Lago Club 's terrace into a national security venue , complete with confidential information open to onlookers , and so on . And it has n't even been a month ! What will it be like after four years ? ? ?
And that 's just the administration . The legislature , emboldened by victory , is also up to no good , and one of their dumbest feats to date is the proposal , on February 3 , of a House bill to abolish the Environmental Protection Agency . Yes , you heard me right . Here 's the entire short bill :
It was introduced by Representative Matt Gaetz of Florida , who had the temerity to put a “ black is white ” post about it on their Facebook page :
Gaetz 's partners in crime ( all Republicans , of course , and all from the South ) are the bill 's cosponsors : Barry Loudermilk ( Georgia ) , Thomas Massie ( Kentucky ) , and Steven Palazzo ( Mississsippi ) . All have abysmal stands on the environment , and some have been vocal critics of the EPA . NBC News gives more information on these representatives , but also reassures us that the bill has virtually no chance of passing , especially since a similar bill ( though not as draconian ) was introduced six years ago . ( Go here to see other reasons why it wo n't pass . )
While some conservatives are praising the proposal , the legislation has little chance of getting through both chambers of Congress .
“ It 's hard to imagine Congress being willing to do so , and the American public would almost certainly virulently oppose such a move , ” Ann Carlson , an environmental law professor at the University of California-Los Angeles Law School , told Bloomberg BNA in March . Since its creation in 1970 under President Richard Nixon , the EPA has grown into an agency with an $ 8 billion fund . And throughout its history , politicians have called to end the EPA both on the campaign trail and through legislation . Six years ago , Sen. Richard Burr , R-North Carolina , introduced a bill with 15 co-sponsors to consolidate the Energy Department and the EPA , but the proposal never made it through the Senate . And earlier that year , as a 2012 presidential candidate , New Gingrich proposed abolishing the agency , as well
I 'm not worried that this bill will pass , as it 's unthinkable to get rid of an agency like this ( of course with Trump the unthinkable has become thinkable ) , but it 's symptomatic of the follies that have now become licensed with the Chief Clown as President .

TIRANA , July 3 – In an interview for Deutsche Welle Shqip , reporter for the German parliamentary group CDU/CSU Thorsten Frei said that EU membership negotiations with Albania wo n't open before the end of 2019 .
Asked concerning the widely debated issue of an exact date to open negotiations with Albania , Frei said it was agreed in Brussels that the vote for Albania 's and Macedonia 's negotiations will remain in the 2019 agenda , after elections for the European Parliament take place .
However , they clarified , this is not a decision that belongs to the Council of Foreign Ministers but to the European Council , and since the council did not directly decide on it , it can not be interpreted as neither a “ yes ” nor a “ no , ” despite claims for either by the Albanian government and opposition .
“ The date will depend , but not before the end of 2019 . We , as a parliamentary group of the CDU and CSU parties , would have already welcomed a decision to open accession negotiations under some conditions . For Albania , we would have agreed to open negotiations under two conditions : the finalization of the vetting for 57 of the highest judges and prosecutors and the finalization of the electoral reform , ” Frei added .
Concerning the electoral reform , which is the second important condition Germany will be setting after the vetting of judges and prosecutors , Frei clarified it will be considered successful only once the latest elections for local power take place under the new electoral reform , which needs to be approved based on a consensus with the country 's opposition .
It is unclear , judging by the current political situation in Albania , how able will the government be to reach a consensus with the opposition on the electoral reform , which is asking for its resignation every other week .
DW also asked Frei about the contested possibility that Albania might take Europe 's unwanted migrants in camps in exchange for gaining candidate status , like the front-runners Serbia and Montenegro .
“ We can not expect Albania to sacrifice itself for this issue . Why does it need to do that ? Is n't Albania gon na become an EU member ? ” Frei asked , saying the refugee camps would make more sense being placed somewhere outside the EU , like North Africa .

Chief of Korea 's Public Procurement Service Chung Yang-ho ( The Public Procurement Service )
The Korea Public Procurement Expo 2017 kicks off Wednesday , seeking to reach out to a wide range of global buyers.It is held by the state-run Public Procurement Service .

Bollywood 's friends-turned-foes Kajol and Karan Johar may have finally buried the hatchet and called in a truce . The two stars who have been on warring paths since Diwali last year seem to be taking baby steps towards rebuilding their long-time friendship . If the stars ' social media activity is anything to go by , then fans can surely look forward to reconciliation between the two . On the festival of Raksha Bandhan , Karan treated fans to the first picture of their twins Yash and Roohi . While the picture made headlines , and the adorable babies received a wave of love and blessings from fans and well wishers , it also seemed to have won over their daddy 's former friend - Kajol .
Keeping their differences aside , the actor ‘ liked ' the picture on Instagram . Karan seemed to have taken note of the same and ‘ followed ' them back . It did n't take fans on social networking handles to take note of the same and cheer the two on .
For those unaware , Kajol and Karan had a fall out last year after their husband Ajay Devgn 's film ‘ Shivaay ' clashed with KJo 's ‘ Ae Dil Hai Mushkil ' . A lot of bad blood was spilled over claims of the director allegedly paid Rs 25 lakh to sabotage Devgn 's film . It was after this that Karan mentioned in their biography that they were extremely pained and hurt by the turn of events . “ When they ( Kajol ) reacted to the whole situation and put out a tweet saying , ‘ Shocked ! ' that 's when I knew it was completely over for me , ” they wrote in their memoir .
Kajol , on the other hand , has always maintained stoic silence about the same .

We all reach for that doughnut or glass of wine if we 're particularly having a bad day , but experts say when stress eating becomes a habit , it could potentially be harmful .
Stress eating is one type of way to emotionally eat , says registered psychotherapist Natalie Shay of Toronto . Other types of emotional eating are when you eat if you 're angry , sad , bored or tired .
“ [ Emotional eating is when ] somebody who uses food to suppress their feelings and emotions , ” they tell Global News .
Tzabia Siegel , a clinical nutritionist and life coach based in Toronto , says although they could be used interchangeably , stress eating and emotional eating are different .
READ MORE : Are you an emotional eater ? Blame your parents , study suggests
“ You can never separate stress and emotional eating entirely , ” they say . “ Emotions are leading to the stress and when we talk about stress in the body , it does n't matter if it 's coming from emotions or infection or pollution or hard relationships . ”
And when someone does n't have a good grasp on why they eat what they eat , it can lead to overeating , binge eating or other eating disorders . Siegel says one of the first things people who emotionally eat a lot can do is understand the difference between physical and psychological hunger .
“ For physical hunger , our body needs fuel and psychological hunger is when something else is triggering it . Until they understand what physical hunger is , they ca n't identify psychological hunger . ”
The warning signs
Shay says there are several warning signs of emotional eating people need to be aware of .
1 ) When you turn to food to manage emotions : This is when you seek comfort in food , so much so that it makes you feel better and helps ease whatever pain you are going through .
2 ) Your eating feels out of control : “ You feel like you have no control over your eating , ” Shay says . “ You may reach for cookies and find you have eaten three rows of them . Your ability to control your urge is weak . ”

3 ) You hide your eating from others : You may hide food in your room , they say , wake up when others are sleeping to eat it . “ You find yourself irritable when others are around as you are just waiting for them to leave so you can eat . ”
4 ) You eat to the point you feel discomfort : Shay says this discomfort is usually in the abdomen , making it hard for you to move .
5 ) You are always thinking of food : “ Others may be speaking with you but you are so focused on food you are not able to focus on all their words . Your mind is always thinking about the next time you will be able to eat and what you may eat . ”
And both experts agree when it comes to type of food , most of us are eating salty , fatty and sugary foods when we are stressed .
“ They taste good and they raise serotonin levels , the feel-good hormone , ” Siegel says . “ It 's a quick fix but we all know it does n't last . ”
How to manage stress eating
Shay says in order to figure out if you are emotionally eating , start by keeping track of both your emotions and what you are eating . This will help you pinpoint any patterns , they say .
“ Set a timer for five minutes and pause before seeking solace in food . This will help you build your resilience to sitting with the emotions , ” they add .
READ MORE : ‘ Clean eating ' trend has eating disorder specialists concerned
They also suggest creating a toolkit for yourself to find other ways to release stress . This could include having a friend that you call or talking a walk — things other than turning to food .
Siegel continues it 's not easy to always recognize you have may be dealing with an eating disorder or even emotional eating . In this case , it is important to reach out for help .
“ Letting go of food is challenging and as soon as you recognize something is n't right for you , you can make changes with the support network around you , ” they say . “ And if nothing is happening , reach out to somebody who can help . Food is primal . ”

San Francisco is leading the nation in overturning marijuana convictions and will dismiss approximately 3,000 misdemeanor cases and review 5,000 felony cases . The action comes on the heels of the passing of Proposition 64 , which legalized the recreational use of marijuana . Prop 64 will allow San Francisco to retroactively apply California 's new marijuana legalization laws to prior convictions , expunging or reducing misdemeanors and felonies dating to 1975 . Drug convictions disproportionately impact African Americans . African Americans and whites use drugs at similar rates , but the imprisonment rate of Black folks for drug charges is almost 6 times that of whites . African Americans represent 12.5 % of illicit drug users , but 29 % of those arrested for drug offenses and 33 % of those incarcerated in state facilities for drug offenses . According to the NAACP , the over incaceration shatters lives , destroys communities and harms the children of those imprisoned .
Not only are Black folks incarcerated at dramatically higher rates than whites for the same crimes they are shut out of the growing legal marijuana business . In Maryland , licenses for growing and selling medical marijuana is among the highest in the nation . Prospective medical marijuana growers have to pay $ 125,000 a year for a two-year license , while dispensaries have to pay $ 40,000 a year , according to the recommendations of a state commission . Maryland 's Legislative Black Caucus is pushing the General Assembly to pass a bill expanding the medical marijuana growing industry to include African-American firms . And some members suggested the powerful voting bloc should “ take a knee ” if the legislation is not on the governor 's deskthis month . Black leaders in Annapolis were outraged in 2016 when the first 15 preliminary licenses to grow medical marijuana were announced and no firms led by African-Americans were among them . African-Americans make up about a third of the state 's population , and the law legalizing medical marijuana instructed regulators to “ actively ” seek racial diversity when awarding the licenses . Since last year , the Black Caucus pushed for an expansion of the nascent medical pot industry , and wanted to create five new pot-growing licenses that would likely go to African-American firms . Legislation to do that advanced almost to passage this year but died without a final vote in the waning minutes of this year 's General Assembly session in April .
The last-minute and unexpected failure of the legislation prompted a strong rebuke from black leaders .
“ We have not shirked away from calling it what it was , and we felt that , once again , black folks were put at the back of the line , ” Caucus member Cheryl Glenn said
Unlike Maryland , some states that have legalized marijuana are encouraging minorities to enter the growing cannabis industry after years of drug enforcement that had a disproportionate effect on black and Hispanic communities . California voters legalized recreational marijuana in November . The first retail sales are expected in January . Oakland officials approved a program that initially sets aside half of the city 's marijuana licenses for low-income residents who have been convicted of a cannabis crime or who live in a specified neighborhood where drug enforcement has been intense . Advocates are urging similar programs statewide , including in San Francisco and Los Angeles.African-Americans made up 5.6 percent of the state but 16 percent of marijuana arrests in 2015 , according to an AP analysis of statistics collected by the FBI .
Florida lawmakers passed a bill last year to address issues that arose with the state 's 2014 medical marijuana law , including provisions to favor black farmers .
The provisions ensure that once the state 's medical marijuana patient registry reaches 250,000 , three additional cultivation licenses will be made available , with one of them designated for a member of the Florida Black Farmers and Agriculturists Association .
Black farmers in Florida were among thousands across the country who sued the U.S. Department of Agriculture for racial discrimination , saying they had been unfairly denied government loans and subsidies in the 1980s and 1990s . The case ended with an historic settlement in 1999 .

LAGOS ( Reuters ) - Semi-nomadic herdsmen armed with guns killed 16 people on Tuesday in an attack on a church congregation in a central state of Nigeria plagued by communal violence , police said .
Hundreds of people have died in clashes this year between herders and farmers in central Nigeria in an outbreak of violence that has put pressure on President Muhammadu Buhari less than a year before an election they want to contest .
The bloody clashes , linked to grazing rights and dwindling fertile land , have raised questions about the government 's ability to maintain security in the country .
Moses Yamu , a police spokesperson in Benue state , said the attack took place around 6 a.m. ( 0500 GMT ) in the village of Ayar Mbalom , in Gwer East local government authority .
“ Sixteen persons were confirmed killed , including two priests , ” said Yamu .
Herdsmen involved in the communal violence are mainly Muslims from the Fulani ethnic group , while members of the settled farming communities are mostly Christian . Attacks have been carried out by both sides .
Some 73 people were killed in central states - known as the “ Middle Belt ” - in the first few days of 2018 , prompting a high- profile mass burial in Benue state 's capital , Makurdi .
Critics of Buhari , a Muslim who is Fulani , have accused them of failing to crack down on herdsmen because they are from the same ethnic group - an accusation their administration has repeatedly denied .
The latest killings were described as “ heinous ” by Buhari , a 75-year-old former military ruler who vowed to improve security when they took office in May 2015 .
“ Violating a place of worship , killing priests and worshippers is not only vile , evil and satanic , it is clearly calculated to stoke up religious conflict and plunge our communities into endless bloodletting , ” they said in a statement .
Buhari declared earlier this month they would seek a second term . Their candidacy depends on party approval , which is widely seen as a formality .
The Middle Belt region includes a number of swing states that could play a significant role in determining Buhari 's electoral prospects .

PESHAWAR , Pakistan ( Reuters ) - At least 11 soldiers were killed and 13 wounded on Saturday in a suicide attack near an army base in northern Pakistan , officials said , in a region that was once controlled by a local faction of the Taliban .
Attacks have decreased sharply in the picturesque Swat Valley but can cause alarm in a region where Pakistani Taliban insurgents took partial control in 2007 , before being ousted two years later in a major military operation hailed as an important blow against Islamist violence .
Swat was the first sizeable region outside Pakistan 's lawless tribal regions bordering Afghanistan to fall to the militants . More than 2,000 Taliban fighters have been driven out of the region , government officials say .
The Pakistan Army 's public relations wing said in a statement that the “ suicide attack ” in the Swat Valley took place at the “ army unit sports area ” .
“ The soldiers were playing volleyball in the evening outside the military base ... when a suicide bomber managed to blow themselves up , ” said a security official who asked not to be identified .
The match was also being watched by civilians , and the casualty count could rise as a large number of people had gathered in the area , they said , adding that wounded were being shifted to a nearby military hospital .
The attack was claimed by the Tehreek-e-Taliban , also known as the Pakistani Taliban , in a statement sent to the media .
“ God willing Tehreek-e-Taliban has started the process of revenge attacks , ” Taliban spokesperson Mohammad Khurasani said in the statement . “ Wait for more ( attacks ) to follow . ”
The military has been on alert for signs of a Taliban resurgence as it seeks to rebuild civilian institutions and win over the local population as a bulwark against radical ideology .
Since being chased out the region , the Taliban have carried out revenge attacks against anti-militancy activists and attempted to extort money from business owners in a region where Pakistan has stationed more than 4,000 soldiers .
Pakistan 's Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi condemned the attack .
“ No cowardly attack can deter us in pursuing our struggle against the menace of terrorism to its logical conclusion . We will continue our fight till the last trace is rooted out , ” the prime minister said in a statement .

Feb 2 ( Reuters ) - Shares of Spirit AeroSystems Holdings Inc slumped as much as 10 percent on Friday after the aircraft parts maker said higher capital expenditure would take a toll on its 2018 free cash flow target .
The company , which makes sections of the fuselage , wing frame work and structural components , plans to ramp up production as robust demand for air travel encourages two of its biggest customers , Boeing Co and Airbus , to lift delivery targets .
Savings from changes to the U.S. tax code will be used for “ high-return ” capital expenditures and research and development activities , Chief Executive Tom Gentile said in a statement .
The comments come as several U.S. companies have said they would return at least a portion of their tax gains to shareholders through buyback and dividends .
Wichita , Kansas-based Spirit Aero 's shares were on track to post their worst intraday percentage loss in nearly two years .
Free cash flow , a measure of how much cash a business generates after accounting for capital expenditures , is expected to be between $ 550 million and $ 600 million in 2018 , the company said .
“ The consensus ( for free cash flow forecast ) for 2018 was $ 612 million , ” Seaport Global Securities analyst Josh Sullivan said .
Spirit Aero plans to hire more workers and invest in 3D printing and automation as it looks to counter “ significant operational challenges ” to meet demand from aircraft makers .
However , the jump in deliveries helped the company beat revenue and profit estimates for the fourth quarter .
Spirit Aero earned $ 1.32 per share on an adjusted basis in the quarter ended Dec. 31 , beating the average estimate of $ 1.21 .
Total revenue rose 9.2 percent to $ 1.71 billion , above the $ 1.66 billion expected by analysts .
The company in August reached an agreement with Boeing on pricing terms , ending months of uncertainty over its ties to its largest customer , while giving clarity on its long-term cash flow .

RIO DE JANEIRO ( Reuters ) - Brazilian police arrested a senior General Electric Co executive on Wednesday , as part of a sprawling investigation into fraud in medical equipment tenders overseen by health authorities in the state of Rio de Janeiro , police and prosecutors said .
In addition to the arrest of GE 's chief executive for Latin America , Daurio Speranzini Jr. , prosecutors said federal police were carrying out 21 arrest warrants as part of the investigation , which concerns a trauma institute known as Into and involves some 37 companies .
The investigation , code-named `` Operation Resonance , '' is the latest fraud and corruption probe in Brazil , where the arrest of high-ranking political and business figures has become a matter of routine , particularly in Rio de Janeiro .
Speranzini was previously the head of Philips Medical Systems in Brazil . Frederik Knudsen , who prosecutors said was a sales supervisor at Philips in Brazil during the period under investigation , was also among the people police were seeking to arrest .
In a document sent to a federal court and seen by Reuters , prosecutors said there `` exists robust proof of participation '' by Speranzini and Knudsen in corruption , bid rigging , and criminal conspiracy .
In addition to the arrests , police said they executed 44 search warrants on Wednesday , which included buildings occupied by Philips and U.S. multinational Johnson & Johnson .
A federal court also ordered some 1.2 billion reais ( $ 307 million ) in assets to be frozen .
It was not immediately possible to contact Speranzini or Knudsen .
GE said in a statement that with regard to the police operation `` that resulted in the temporary imprisonment of Daurio Speranzini Jr. , we clarify that the allegations refer to a period in which the executive was leading a different company . ''
It added , `` GE emphasizes that it is not the target of the investigation . The company believes that the facts will be clarified by the courts and the company is at the disposition of the authorities to cooperate . ''
Koninklijke Philips NV , as Philips is formally known , said in a statement the company 's current leaders were not involved in the police operation and that the firm was cooperating with authorities .
Philips `` still does n't have access to the official accusations ; however , the company is cooperating with the authorities to offer all clarifications regarding the allegations , that go back many years , '' the company said , adding that the `` current head executives of Philips are not part of the federal police operation . ''
Johnson & Johnson said it `` vigorously followed '' Brazilian law and was `` cooperating fully '' with the investigation .

Leaders of Egypt , Ethiopia and Sudan met this week to restore cordial relations on the Nile River water after weeks of frosty ties between Egypt and Sudan . Tensions have simmered between the two for decades , and the meeting on the sidelines of the African Union ( AU ) summit in Addis Ababa sought to restore normalcy . “ Trilateral issues of mutual interest ” were discussed , including ways of resolving the impasse over the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam ( GERD ) project .
The three countries have for years tried to agree on how the Nile water will be shared once the dam 's construction is completed later this year . However , questions linger about the unresolved issues that the tension has brought to the surface – specifically regarding a formula for sustainably sharing the water of the 6,650km-long Nile River among the 11 riparian countries .
“ Everything is going well . We are speaking as one nation , not three , ” Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi reportedly said after a meeting on 30 January with Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir and Ethiopian Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn . Ethiopia 's Foreign Affairs Ministry tweeted that the meeting was “ very successful ” . But these sentiments contrasted with the recent tension between Egypt and Sudan . And Ethiopia rejected Egypt 's proposal to involve the World Bank in the talks even though Desalegn visited Cairo in mid-January .
Despite a bilateral agreement between Egypt and Sudan dating back to 1959 , the right approach to sharing the Nile water is yet to be found . The two countries that have dominated the use of the water have had periodic tension amid competing needs . But Ethiopia has reserved its right to make unilateral decisions regarding the use of the water , including the decision to embark on GERD , Africa 's largest hydroelectric power project .
The recent diplomatic spat between Egypt and Sudan gave a glimpse into the complex nature of the multinational dispute . Within two months , tension escalated after unverified reports that Egypt sought to sideline Sudan in the tripartite talks on the dam . Sudan alleged that El-Sisi had called for this in a letter to Desalegn , and the latter 's visit to Cairo affirmed this perception . Citing crime and unsubstantiated threats to Sudan , Khartoum closed its border with Eritrea , which has cultivated close ties with Egypt . Eritrea and Ethiopia remain bitter rivals and the former 's blossoming ties with Egypt have fuelled speculation in Ethiopia and Sudan that if a major crisis erupts over the Nile , Eritrea would be a proxy for Egypt .
Sudan revived its long-standing claim to the disputed Halayeb border region with its northern neighbour . It recalled its ambassador to Cairo and petitioned the United Nations ( UN ) over the border dispute . In response , Egypt deployed troops in the region and sent fighter jets off its Red Sea coast . Egypt expressed concern over strengthening of ties between Sudan and Turkey , a country it considers hostile within the context of Middle East politics . It also accused Khartoum of harbouring Islamist dissidents belonging to the Muslim Brotherhood , which is opposed to the establishment in Cairo .
A parallel between recent developments and events in the 1950s sheds light on why tensions escalated so fast between Sudan and Egypt .
Sudan 's independence prime minister Abdullah Khalil brought pressure on Egypt to sign a Nile Waters Agreement in 1959 . Before this treaty , the Nile water was shared between Egypt and Sudan under an agreement concluded in 1929 between Egypt and the British Government on behalf of Sudan . The treaty essentially guaranteed Egypt all its needs at the expense of the future water needs of Sudan and eight other states along the Nile Valley .
There is a history of brinksmanship in resolving bilateral stand-offs between the two countries due to a lack of conflict resolution mechanisms in the two treaties . In 1958 Egypt laid claim to two territories in the Halayeb region . Khalil sent troops to the disputed territory . Developments then , echoed by current events , suggested an imminent military clash along the common border – but Egypt reconsidered its position . Just as the situation unfolded recently , Sudan urged the UN Security Council and Egypt to let the crisis die away , making it appear as if it had abandoned its claim over Halayeb .
Sudan disowned the 1929 agreement but it could not abrogate the only method under international law of regulating the sharing of the Nile water with Egypt .
The two treaties established the virtual monopoly that Egypt and Sudan enjoy over the Nile water . The two countries did n't invite or consult Ethiopia or any other riparian state during the renegotiation period . Ethiopia officially stated in 1957 that it reserved the right to use the Nile water for the benefit of its people , observing that Sudan and Egypt could n't make decisions about water that largely originated in Ethiopia . More than 85 % of the Nile water comes from the Blue Nile , which starts in Ethiopia . Ethiopia 's claims on the Nile water therefore have greater significance for Egypt than those of Sudan .
Sudan , a downstream riparian of Ethiopia and an upstream riparian of Egypt , remains displeased with the allocation it received in the 1959 agreement . However , the treaty has no provision for amendment or a mechanism for settling disputes . It is therefore a constant source of potential conflict between Egypt and Sudan , on one side , and Ethiopia and the eight other riparian states on the other .
Egypt and Sudan have scuttled a regional initiative to address the collective claim by riparian states . In 2010 they developed what they believed would be a permanent legal and institutional framework for governing the Nile River Basin , the Cooperative Framework Agreement , which provides for the establishment of a permanent river basin commission .
Experts say a sustainable solution lies in basin-wide co-operation that would encourage holistic management of the Nile water and not in unilateral large-scale hydro projects . One approach is to implement the most economically viable projects for optimum gain within the entire basin . The other is to embrace a range of economic activities to ease the current pressure on the river .
Current talks between Egypt , Ethiopia and Sudan aim to find state-centric solutions to a unilaterally initiated large-scale hydro project , which may or smay not be viable for the entire basin . Unless talks take into account a basin-wide approach , they are doomed to fail . The continued disregard of other riparian states in finding a formula for sustainably sharing the Nile water is bound to lead to more conflict . DM

Yuvraj Singh has been left out of the ODI squad for Sri Lanka More
​
What 's the story ?
The ODI squad for the upcoming five ODIs between India and Sri Lanka was announced on Sunday evening . Some of the regular players of the team were rested , while the relatively inexperienced ones were called to the squad .
Addressing the media at a press conference , BCCI 's chief selector MSK Prasad explained the reason behind resting the players , saying that trying the younger ones will help them form the core group for the 2019 World Cup .
“ Senior players will be rested to give youngsters a chance . ( This ) will give us a group for 2019 WC . Ashwin playing county cricket is a blessing in disguise . They were rested first but we did n't know they were contacted for county . They were rested but they informed BCCI of intention to play county . So rest becomes player rotation . ”
They further revealed that they intend to give 22-24 young players a chance to prove their mettle , for the team to filter out the best for England 2019 .
“ 22-24 players identified as pool for 2019 WC . Will all be given a go in short term . List to be pruned from time to time . ”
In case you did n't know
Last week , news had it that Ravi Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja will be playing in the remainder of the County Championship in England for Worcestershire .
The heart of the matter
India has a very good bench strength , in both the bowling and batting department . In a country which was criticised for not producing enough pacers , they have a surplus of the same today . From Mohammad Shami and Bhuvneshwar Kumar to Shardul Thakur and Basil Thampi , there is no dearth of quicks .
Similarly , India have additional pace options in players like Kuldeep Yadav and Axar Patel . As for the batsmen , the waitlist on the fringes is pretty long .
​
Squad for the ODIS
Virat Kohli ( Captain ) , Shikhar Dhawan , Rohit Sharma ( vice captain ) , KL Rahul , Manish Pandey , Ajinkya Rahane , Kedar Jadhav , MS Dhoni ( wk ) , Hardik Pandya , Axar Patel , Kuldeep Yadav , Yuzvendra Chahal , Jasprit Bumrah , Bhuvneshwar Kumar , Shardul Thakur .
What 's next ?
India are currently playing the dead rubber at Pallekele , which will be followed by five ODIs beginning on August 20 at Dambulla . The only T20I will be played on September 6 .
Author 's Take
The Sri Lanka ODI series is an ideal platform to test India 's bench strength , given that the opposition are a depleted side . India have quite a few full-fledged series coming up , both at home and away , which will help filter out the players who can be in the World Cup 2019 squad .

Over the weekend a bidding war broke out over the rights to adapt a biography of Leonardo da Vinci which will be produced by and star Leonardo DiCaprio because they have the same name . No seriously , allegedly their mother named them “ Leonardo ” because they were looking at a da Vinci painting when they kicked for the first time . ( That sounds like some sh * t you make up because you saddled your kid with an unwieldy name , but okay . ) The biography is by Walter Isaacson , the same guy who wrote the Steve Jobs biography that eventually became a movie starring Michael Fassbender . Paramount ended up coughing seven figures for the rights to the movie , and the da Vinci project will be part of the Paramount/DiCaprio production pact forged last year .
I have to say , I 'm merely whelmed . It 's not that I do n't want to see a da Vinci movie—I do . Like Abraham Lincoln , Leonardo da Vinci is obviously a time traveler and I would love to see a movie about their mission to the past but somehow I do n't think this is the movie Leonardo DiCaprio is going to make . I get the feeling this will be a “ tortured genius ” movie with Leo sweaty and long-haired and making that one face where they stick out their lower jaw as they try to convey what a genius they are . I just do n't think “ we have the same name ” is a good enough reason for someone to get to play a figure like Leonardo da Vinci .
In their biographical collection , Lives of the Artists , Giorgio Vasari—himself a Renaissance painter—writes of da Vinci : “ [ He was ] an artist of outstanding physical beauty who displayed infinite grace in everything they did… ” Vasari also calls da Vinci “ the most talented improviser in verse of their time ” , and dubs them “ so lovable ” . Vasari is clearly awed by da Vinci—which they are NOT by many of their other subjects , Lives is full of gossip and sh * t-talking—but they spend pages and pages peppering descriptions of da Vinci 's work and process with anecdotes about how fun and beautiful da Vinci is .
Does that really sound like Leonardo DiCaprio ? Fun and funny and lovable ? Twenty years ago , maybe , but as an adult there 's something flinty in DiCaprio 's expressions , which is why their best performances have been hard cases and bad guys . Da Vinci , it seems , had a twinkle , so the actor who plays them should have a twinkle , too . Matt Bomer , maybe , or even Harry Styles , who turns out is a surprisingly good actor and also has that hard to resist star quality . Jon Hamm ? They can twinkle when they want . There are so many other potentially interesting choices to play da Vinci than Leonardo “ We Have The Same Name ” DiCaprio . Besides , DiCaprio needs to make that HH Holmes movie based on The Devil in the White City with Martin Scorsese . At this point , not making The Devil in the White City is starting to feel personal . If Devil gets bumped for this da Vinci movie they should n't even be starring in , I am going to be SO annoyed .

( CNN ) -- Mariah Carey 's botched New Year 's Eve performance is turning into an even bigger controversy .
Carey 's team is blaming Dick Clark Productions , the production company behind the annual `` New Year 's Rockin ' Eve '' special on ABC , saying the company `` set them up to fail . '' And Dick Clark Productions is firing back .
`` As the premier producer of live television events for nearly 50 years , we pride ourselves on our reputation and long-standing relationships with artists . To suggest that DCP , as producer of music shows including the American Music Awards , Billboard Music Awards , New Year 's Rockin ' Eve and Academy of Country Music Awards , would ever intentionally compromise the success of any artist is defamatory , outrageous and frankly absurd , '' Dick Clark Productions said in a statement provided to CNN .
The statement continued : `` In very rare instances there are of course technical errors that can occur with live television , however , an initial investigation has indicated that [ Dick Clark Productions ] had no involvement in the challenges associated with Ms. Carey 's New Year 's Eve performance . We want to be clear that we have the utmost respect for Ms. Carey as an artist and acknowledge their tremendous accomplishments in the industry . ''
Their response comes after Carey 's team spoke to Billboard magazine and claimed that Carey , who had attended a rehearsal earlier in the day , had alerted Dick Clark Productions that their ear piece was not working . Carey 's publicist , Nicole Perna , said that their client `` was not winging this moment and took it very seriously '' and added , `` A shame that production set them up to fail . ''
Perna separately said to CNN , `` There was a production issue . Technical difficulties . Unfortunately there was nothing they could do to continue with the performance given the circumstances . ''
As for Carey singing along to a track , a source close to them said : `` It is not uncommon for artists to sing to track during certain live performances . ''
Carey took the stage shortly before midnight for a three song set , first performing `` Auld Lang Syne '' before moving to their own song , the 1991 hit `` Emotions . '' That 's when things started visibly going downhill . While the track played , Carey told the audience that a proper sound check had not taken place and opted to let those in the crowd sing their lyrics . After walking off stage in a huff after attempting to sing their hit , `` We belong together , '' Carey took to Instagram to post a meme with the caption : Sh * * happens . Have a happy and healthy new year everybody ! Here 's to making more headlines in 2017 . ''

The source said that under the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Bill , 2016 those who posted the picture on their pages and those who circulated it have also committed a crime .
We would not only register a case against the person who uploaded the picture but to those also who circulated it , an official said .
According to sources , the agency is investigating the case and has interviewed three bloggers .
This is technical report we are working on , an official said .
They said that after completing the report the agency would go to court and after court 's approval , an FIR would be launched .

For cognizable crimes , the FIA can arrest someone and investigate .
It was learnt that the bloggers who appeared before the agency on Saturday , were missing .
Either , Multan-based bloggers are avoiding media or have been arrested is still unclear .

London : The Football Association demanded answers from Manchester United and Manchester City on Monday following reports of ugly scenes that reportedly left City assistant coach Mikel Arteta bloodied after a fracas .
The Guardian newspaper said Arteta was left with blood streaming down their face after a bust-up involving up to 20 players and members of staff from the two clubs after Sunday 's Manchester derby , which City won 2-1 .
Referee Michael Oliver did not witness the scenes so the FA has not received a report on the matter from them but it has given the clubs until Wednesday to reply to a request for observations following the incident .
United manager Jose Mourinho and City goalkeeper Ederson are reported to have had a confrontation after the game , while it is claimed Mourinho had milk and water thrown at them from the away dressing room .
The home side is understood to have taken exception to City 's post-match celebrations .
The Guardian reported that Arteta 's eyebrow was split open during the melee in a narrow corridor outside City 's dressing room and said there were unconfirmed reports that another member of Guardiola 's backroom staff needed medical treatment .
The corridor leading to the dressing rooms apparently became congested as players and staff made their way through it after the game , and tensions spilled over into pushing and shoving , with Arteta understood to have suffered a cut to the head .
Mourinho did not make any reference to what had happened during their post-match media work , according to the report .
Arteta was being assessed in the City dressing room after being caught in the crossfire , the report said .
The victory , courtesy of set-piece goals from David Silva and Nicolas Otamendi propelled City 11 points clear of United at the top of the Premier League table , further enhancing their status as red-hot favourites for the title .
Mourinho had accused City 's players of diving and committing `` tactical fouls '' prior to the game and afterwards they made an unconvincing claim their side should have been awarded a late penalty when Ander Herrera was booked for diving .
But City manager Pep Guardiola said : `` We won because we were better . In all departments , we were better . ''
The incident at Old Trafford brought to mind the famous `` Battle of the Buffet '' that erupted after United beat Arsenal in October 2004 , when Arsenal midfielder Cesc Fabregas threw pizza at United manager Alex Ferguson .
Snowy streets are thought to be at least partially responsible for a series of collisions on Calgary roads on Monday .
Emergency crews were called to a rollover on Glenmore Trail at around 8 a.m . The crash occurred in the eastbound lanes approaching Deerfoot Trail S.E .
Shortly after , a second rollover occurred on westbound Glenmore Trail approaching Blackfoot Trail S.E .
EMS said drivers in both rollovers suffered only minor injuries .
Police were then called to a multi-vehicle collision on southbound Deerfoot Trail at Douglasdale Blvd . S.E . No injuries were reported .
Later , emergency crews were called to a collision on southbound Macleod Trail and 58 Avenue S.W . One person was checked on scene by EMS .
On its website , the City of Calgary said snow stopped falling shortly after 1 a.m. on Monday .
Crews are focusing on plowing , salting and sanding Priority 1 routes . When Priority 1 routes have been cleared , crews will move on to Priority 2 routes .
As of 9 a.m. , the City of Calgary said it does not anticipate the need to call a snow route parking ban .
The proposal threatens to cut off the federal government 's access to essential data and subject science to political manipulation , the research groups say . That is because many health studies involve large amounts of patient data that can be accessed only under condition of confidentiality . Banning such studies would prevent the EPA from considering a wide range of health impacts when looking at rules to limit pollution .
For Daniel Paul , a Mi'kmaq elder , an old piece of offensive and outdated legislation is on their mind , and he 's urging both the federal government and the Nova Scotia legislature to hear them out .
The elder is calling for a proclamation passed in 1756 , by the then-commander and governor of the British colony of Nova Scotia , to be officially repealed .

Charles Lawrence had issued a bounty for the scalps of any Mi'kmaq men . Despite their later decision to end hostilities against the Indigenous People of the colony and establish treaties , the original scalping proclamation was never repealed .
It 's something that Paul says needs to be done .
“ I ca n't understand , OK ? Really , I ca n't understand . Do n't make any sense to me . They can come forward and do it without any effort whatsoever . We 're not looking for any kind of compensation for it or anything . All we 're looking for is a simple apology and revoke it , ” they said .
In 2000 , the Nova Scotia Legislative Assembly passed a resolution calling the proclamation “ repugnant and offensive , ” and also asking the federal government to confirm the status of the proclamation .
WATCH : Mi'kmaq say Treaty Day in Nova Scotia now about celebration
In an email to Global News , Indigenous and Northern Affairs Canada says the treaties made the scalping proclamation inoperative .
“ It has no force or effect in law… the Proclamation is not a law in Canada and as such , Canada could not repeal it , ” they wrote .
But that 's not good enough for Paul .
“ The fact is , it 's still there , and as long as it 's still there , it 's an irritant , and why keep it ? ” they say .
Authorities say a 70-year-old man and a small dog died in a house fire in Round O Friday morning .
The fire happened in the 20000 block of Augusta Highway and caused the roof of the house to cave in , according to Colleton County Fire/Rescue Chief Barry McRoy .
Family members at the scene identified the victim as Billy Lee .
Emergency crews learned about the fire after someone who was driving by the house saw it engulfed in flames and then called authorities .
The caller told responders that the home was fully involved .
According to fire officials , firefighters found the man near the front door .
`` Traffic on busy Augusta Highway was down to one lane for several hours , '' CCFR officials said . `` The cause of the fire is under investigation . ''
SLED is investigating the incident , McCroy said .

The assassination of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un 's half-brother in broad daylight at an international airport sounds like a scene from a spy movie , featuring a fugitive high-profile figure and undercover agents in action.The two female assassins -- presumed to be highly trained special agents -- seem to harken back to a time when purging individuals by guns and poison was not uncommon in the political arena.Malaysian media outlet the Star reported Wednesday that local police were analyzing CCTV footage of the Kuala Lumpur International Airport.It was here that Kim Jong-nam , the 46-year-old half-brother of the North Korean leader , was killed by an unidentified toxic substance at around 9 a.m. on Monday.The CCTV footage showed one of the two female figures who approached Kim -- a relatively young woman wearing a white long-sleeve T-shirt and a mini skirt . Them agile and sharp movements have led to speculation they and their partner were well-trained special agents dedicated to secret missions , including high-profile assassinations.It is common for the North Korean regime to train women -- often those who look attractive and are sociable -- as special agents . Their prime role is to catch their target off guard and speedily eliminate the “ enemy , ” often using stealthy means such as poisoned needles or close-range shooting.It was also based on such background that a number of female espionage agents were caught over the past decades in action in South Korea.This time , the two agents appeared determined not to miss their target , who has long been a source of annoyance to their state leader.Both of them reportedly turned on Kim while they were at a check-in kiosk before a flight to Macau , with one grasping them from the back and the other spraying a toxic substance onto their face.While the two aggressors fled and disappeared from view by taxi , Kim complained of severe pain , upon which they were moved to the airport 's first aid center and then to a general hospital downtown . They died on the way.By Bae Hyun-jung ( tellme @ heraldcorp.com )
Durham 's public school board says it is looking into how to “ enhance ” its curriculum over the next year to teach children about marijuana-laced edibles .
The Durham District School Board ( DDSB ) says it would like to include information in its lesson plans about the new legislation as Canada gets closer to legalizing pot . However , the legalization date is up in the air , and Health Canada has said that edibles and specific concentrates will be legalized no later than 12 months after the Cannabis Act comes into force .
Dan Hogan , the substance abuse/violence prevention co-ordinator at the DDSB , says teachers may bring in fake edible packages to show children what these can look like and how to differentiate these from unlaced treats .
“ The packaging for a lot of the edibles — particularly , things like gummy bears — really looks like gummy bear packaging , ” they said . “ It looks like something that you want kids to have , and that 's true about almost all the packaged products . ”

Many Durham parents are concerned about children 's access to edibles after two separate incidents earlier this month at Clara Hughes Public School in Oshawa , Ont . The DDSB says a Grade 6 student brought home-baked cookies to school as a treat on May 14 , and after consuming these , four students reported feeling dizzy and euphoric .
“ These were initially made for someone who had a medical condition , ” said Const . George Tudos with the Durham Regional Police Service . “ [ These ] were n't intended [ to be ] eaten at a school . However , they were somehow packed into a backpack and brought to the school , where they were ingested by students . ”
A week before this incident , four children in Grade 7 and 8 consumed THC-infused pre-packaged gummy bears brought in by one of the students .

Duncan McKerchar , whose 11-year-old daughter attends the elementary school , says they were not involved in the incidents but they were “ floored ” when their daughter told them what happened . “ It 's scary to know that it could have been my child , ” they said .
The parent says he , or their daughter 's mother , packs their lunch every day to ensure they know what they are eating .
“ If someone offers you food in school , I 'd stay away from eating it because you never know what could be inside of this food , ” said Tudos .
Hogan says they have started a committee involving Durham police , the region 's health department and the Catholic school board to make sure the messaging to kids surrounding pot use will be the same across Durham Region .

BASTIA-Bastia 's home game with Lyon in French Ligue 1 was abandoned at half time after supporters of the Corsican side twice invaded the pitch and attacked the visiting players on Sunday .
A hardcore section of home fans at Bastia 's Armand Cesari stadium targeted Lyon 's players as they warmed up before the game , causing it to be delayed by more than 50 minutes , and then again as the two sides went in for the break with the score at 0-0 . `` We must stop , we must stop , they hit the players , '' Lyon coach Bruno Genesio told club president Jean-Michel Aulas in the corridors of the stadium . We 're not going to war . ''
Bottom-of-the-table Bastia are likely to have points deducted for the latest trouble involving their supporters . Bastia were punished in February over racist abuse directed at Nice striker Mario Balotelli while the Nice team bus had its windows smashed . `` Following the new incident at the end of the first period , the LFP decided to definitively stop the game between Bastia and Lyon , '' the French professional football league ( LFP ) said in a statement .
In the first incident Lyon players fled to the dressing rooms and the 1500 GMT kick-off was consequently delayed as captains and officials from the two teams and league officials held talks over whether the game should go ahead . Lyon 's players had been finishing their pre-game warm-up when about 50 Bastia fans -- many of them dressed in black -- attacked them , an AFP reporter at the scene said .
The trouble -- the second time in four days that Lyon have been caught up in football violence -- saw former Manchester United winger Memphis Depay reportedly among the Lyon players confronted by Bastia fans in ugly scenes . Stewards and security staff rushed to intervene and for a few minutes there was chaos and scuffles until the playing surface was cleared and the Lyon players took refuge behind a metal gate in the tunnel .
Lyon initially refused to leave the changing rooms again , but eventually did so to warm up for a second time and the game kicked off soon after with flight attendants lined up on the edge of the pitch . However they were powerless to prevent more disturbances at the half-time whistle , triggered by a confrontation between a Bastia official and Lyon goalkeeper Anthony Lopes , who had to be restrained by security men and appeared to be the chief target of the Bastia mob .
Lyon 's players huddled in the dressing room and later left the stadium in their team bus after riot police dispersed about 100 waiting Bastia fans massed at the gates by firing tear gas . Lyon star striker Alexandre Lacazette , who was not playing , tweeted : `` Pfffff shameful ! ''
The French league 's disciplinary commission is certain to hit Bastia hard after it docked them one point -- suspended -- and ordered the club to close its East Stand for three games over the monkey chants by some of its fans at Balotelli .
Nathalie Boy de la Tour , president of the LFP , told AFP : `` We regret that Bastia is giving a horrible image of our football , it hurts the image of professional football , which does not deserve this . ''
On Thursday fans streamed onto the pitch in Lyon 's Europa League home clash with Besiktas and the start of the quarter-final first leg was delayed by 45 minutes as officials attempted to clear their Parc OL playing area of fans . Home supporters poured onto the pitch as they attempted to protect themselves from firecrackers and other objects raining down from the stands above .
On the pitch elsewhere in France , Marseille stayed on course for a Europa League spot with a 4-0 win over St Etienne who have not won at the Stade Velodrome since 1979 . Florian Thauvin scored twice , Bafetimbi Gomis took their league tally to 17 goals while Dimitri Payet added the fourth in time added on .

The 300-kilometre long highway , the only all-weather road linking Kashmir with the rest of the country , was closed following heavy rains and snowfall at several places , including the Jawahar Tunnel , and incidents of shooting stones near Panthal .
In Jammu , the Mughal road , connecting Poonch and Rajouri with south Kashmir 's Shopian district , was also closed after heavy snowfall in Pir Ki Gali .
`` The highway and the Mughal road are closed for the second day today . The highway was closed due to heavy snowfall at the Jawahar Tunnel , the Patnitop and Ramban areas and landslides at Pathiyal . There has been heavy snowfall in Pir Ki Gali and other areas en route Mughal road , '' police officials said .
In the state 's summer capital , flight services to and fro from the Srinagar International Airport were hit due to poor visibility caused by the heavy snowfall , airport authorities said .

Researchers at the University of Exeter have found a statistical link between pneumonia in older people and a group of medicines commonly used to neutralize stomach acid in people with heartburn or stomach ulcers . Although proton-pump inhibitors ( PPIs ) are still a valuable group of medicines , research is indicating that PPIs are not as completely safe for older people as previously thought .
PPIs are medicines commonly prescribed to reduce gastric ( stomach ) acid production and to protect the stomach . Approximately 40 percent of older adults receive PPIs , although according to some experts , up to 85 percent of people who receive PPI prescriptions may not need them .
Researchers say people should not stop using their PPI medication , but should discuss with their prescribing healthcare professional whether the PPIs are still needed . Just stopping PPIs could be dangerous as PPIs may be useful , for example , to prevent stomach bleeds in some people .
Once thought to be relatively harmless , PPIs have more recently been linked to increased rates for certain health concerns like fractures , cardiovascular disease , and some bacterial infections . The association between PPI use and pneumonia was studied because stomach acid helps to prevent infections spreading from the gut in some individuals . Since pneumonia is a major cause of death for older adults , it is important for healthcare providers to understand the links between PPIs and pneumonia .
The Exeter team designed a study to look at statistical links in medical records between long-term PPI use and pneumonia in older adults . Their study was published in the Journal of the American Geriatrics Society .
David Melzer , Professor of Epidemiology and Public Health at the University of Exeter Medical School , said : `` This study shows that there was a higher rate of pneumonia in older people who received PPIs over a two year period . Caution is needed in interpreting the findings as our study is based on analyzing data from medical records , so other factors may be involved . However , our study adds to growing evidence that PPIs are not quite as safe as previously thought , although they are still a very useful class of medication for certain groups of patients . ''
The researchers used information from Clinical Practice Research Datalink ( CPRD ) for England , a large database containing records from many primary care practices in the U.K . They selected patients 60-years-old and older who had taken prescribed PPIs regularly and who also had previous regular medical records . The researchers identified more than 75,000 older adults who were treated with PPIs .
As with all prescription medications , regularly review your use of medicines like PPIs with your healthcare providers to make sure each prescription is still needed .

After successfully arguing that Ontario 's Ministry of Transportation failed to properly consult the community , the Glanworth Drive Bridge between London and St. Thomas appears to have been saved .
READ MORE : Ontario to spend $ 81M to widen Hwy 401 from 6 to 12 lanes in Mississauga
The ministry released updated designs Thursday night for the interchange on Highway 4 , or Colonel Talbot Road , at Highway 401 .
“ The community is feeling invigorated that they 've been listened to , ” Elgin-Middlesex-London MPP Jeff Yurek told 980 CFPL .
“ I hope the biggest takeaway is government ministries , no matter who 's in power , always have the opportunity to listen and be flexible to the needs of area residents when doing large infrastructure projects . ”
The bridge is often used by over-sized farm vehicles as an alternative to major highways and when initial designs were released showing the removal of the bridge , public reaction was swift .

“ The government originally came out with a design that was basically a cookie cutter shape that they had used throughout the province , without meeting and discussing the issue with area residents and those that use the bridge , ” Yurek explained .
“ We had residents in the Lambeth area , businesses , we had farmers and suppliers of agricultural equipment come together , and together we proceeded to compel a case why the government and the MTO needs to maintain the Glanworth bridge . ”
The new designs still have to go through public review before they can be finalized .

As I watched the Ontario leader 's debate this past weekend , I realized there is no doubt that I am a conservative . For me , it 's not just a voting choice in the June 7 election ; it is who I am and what I believe .
The contrast among the three leaders was starkest for me on Sunday night when they answered a question from the audience about child care . While I think the majority of Ontarians believe that government has some role to play in child care , not everyone believes that it is the government 's job to look after our children . Kathleen Wynne and Andrea Horwath have made it clear that their ultimate goal is universality — free government-administered childcare for all . It is more than just a policy ; it is a fundamental view about the role of government in our lives .
READ MORE : Growing number of Ontarians want a majority government , Ipsos poll says
Wynne , through their expansion of government spaces and subsidies , has moved the province considerably down this path . And the NDP plan , which offers public-sector care for no more than $ 12 per day , goes even further . ( By contrast , I pay my high-school aged babysitters $ 15 to 20 per HOUR . )
WATCH : Leaders offer their plans for childcare during final debate
Doug Ford , on the other hand , was clear in the debate that they support choice in child care through a refundable tax credit . They spoke about parents being in the best position to make decisions about the kind of specific care their family needs . I share this point of view .
But child care is just one of the many policies in this campaign that highlight the clear choice voters have between very different values and principles , as the Liberals and NDP have both chosen to move their parties further to the left of the spectrum than in recent elections .
ELECTION PANEL : Ontario election political panel debates who won final debate
Take the somewhat minor example of beer . The Liberals and NDP both recently condemned , and mocked , Ford for promising greater flexibility in the sale and pricing of beer . Their responses pointed to a fundamental difference in thinking . Ford 's announcement was n't about beer ; it was about competition and free markets .
Or take the example of corporate subsidies . Ford does n't believe that government should be using tax dollars to favour one business owner over another through government handouts . The Liberal and NDP disagree and would continue the expensive and unfair practice of corporate welfare .
COMMENTARY : Omar Khan says rejecting Kathleen Wynne just for the sake can be dangerous
Conservatives have a fundamental belief that government can not and should not be all things to all people . It should n't be the first choice to solve every problem . The Liberals and NDP believe that government is the answer to most problems . Just look at their duelling plans for unaffordable “ free ” pharmacare .
During the debate on Sunday , Ford was clear that there is a limit to how much you can tax people and businesses before damaging the economy . They understand that money can move out of a jurisdiction , taking both jobs and investment with it . And so their plan cuts taxes .
WATCH : ‘ Do n't believe the dishonest NDP , ' Doug Ford says during leaders debate
Wynne has recently begun to espouse a similar perspective in their criticism of the NDP , but the Liberal record on tax hikes makes their position laughable . And the NDP are proud of their aggressive plan to take more money out of the pockets of families and job creators .
There are so many more policy areas where the differences in approach are fundamental : on carbon taxes , on legislating striking public-sector workers back to work , on improving math scores in our schools , on tuition , on nuclear energy , on minimum wage and on labour laws .
READ MORE : Here are the 20 closest riding races that could decide the Ontario election
Beyond these policy options , this election has also shone a light on some major differences in values among the candidates for premier . Conservatives believe in playing by the rules . That means a clear and fair process for immigration . By contrast , the NDP believe it 's okay if you have jumped the queue and are in Ontario illegally . No questions asked . Their plan to turn Ontario into a sanctuary province is a wildly expensive and reckless promise that is an insult to new immigrants who have come to our province legally .
Conservatives have pride in our country and those who protect our personal safety and collective freedoms . Horwath 's embrace of candidates who are anti-police and anti-military is shameful . No wonder they were the only leader at Sunday 's debate who did n't thank the veteran — who asked a question by video — for them service .
COMMENTARY : Tom Parkin says NDP 's momentum comes as voters reject Doug Ford 's ‘ man of the people ' act
All four of the Ipsos/Global polls since this election began have shown that Ford and the PCs have maintained a solid level of support that is both committed and motivated . But a high level of undecided voters means that this election is far from over .
So my message to voters who share my conservative outlook is this — there is a lot at stake in this election . Much of what we believe in is at risk . Over the next week , be proud of who we are and what we stand for ; be unapologetic for fighting for taxpayers and future taxpayers . Celebrate competition and playing by the rules . Laud the fact that there is a leader and a plan who offers a clear choice from the other two .
If we do this over the next week , I know we 'll find that a good number of Ontario voters share our point of view . And on June 8 , we will wake up to a Progressive Conservative government .

Decreasing enrolment in English public schools is not a new problem in Quebec .
According to Quebec English School Board Association ( QESBA ) president Jennifer Maccarone , it 's an issue that dates back to the late 1970s .
“ In terms of enrolment in English schools our numbers have been declining significantly since the inception of Bill 101 so right now we 're down to approximately 95,000 students in total enrolment in the province , ” they said .
Bill 101 , passed into law in 1977 , made French the official language of government , courts and workplaces . It also required that all children attend French school , with the exception of those whose parents attended English school in Canada .
READ MORE : What is Bill 101 ?
Maccarone said there are various ways in which to tackle declining enrolment in English schools , including capitalizing on success .
“ We are graduating bilingual students , ” they said . “ All of our English school boards are in the Top 10 in the province and that 's something we need to celebrate and say ‘ listen , you have an opportunity to have an English education and a bilingual future , so choose us . ' ”
But the issue ca n't be solved without a frank conversation about Bill 101 and its impact .
“ Any time we talk about Bill 101 , it is a challenging conversation , ” Maccarone said , adding that despite the difficulty , now is the time to shine the light on the issue .
READ MORE : PQ debates extending Bill 101 to CEGEPs , daycares
“ We 're not asking to completely revamp the law , ” Maccarone said , explaining that a humanitarian clause within the bill could be enacted . “ Some of the students coming into the province could , technically — on a humanitarian basis — be given eligibility to attend English school . ”
Maccarone said allowing immigrants to attend English schools is a solution that would benefit both English and French schools in the province .
“ It certainly would relieve the burden that they 're having in the francophone sector with overcrowding , ” they said . “ It is a win-win situation . It allows us to maintain our numbers and allows the francophone schools to have a little more breathing room . ”

Maccarone insists that the idea is to enhance and contribute to the framework of Quebec society .
“ We have space in some of our schools and as I said earlier , we are very successful , so there 's absolutely no reason we should n't be given an opportunity to educate those students , ” they said . “ We 're looking like anybody else , to ensure that our students and our children are remaining vital and that they remain contributing members of society . ”
South Korea 's top filmmaker , Bong Joon-ho has begun shooting “ Parasite , ” their first film since “ Okja ” which was backed by Netflix and debuted in competition last year in Cannes . It stars Song Kang-ho , Korea 's leading character actor .
The film is a drama about a family of four , in which each member has unique characteristics . Bong says that , despite the title , the film does not include either parasites or alien creatures .
Production started on Sunday . “ The film had been originally scheduled to start shooting in our studio on May 25 , but was pushed back slightly , ” a spokesperson from Goyang Aqua Studio , an outfit that specializes in underwater shooting , told Variety on Wednesday .
After shooting “ Snowpiercer ” and “ Okja ” largely in English , the film is Bong 's first Korean-language title since their 2009 “ Mother. ” They have reassembled production elements from “ Mother. ” Barunson E & A is on board as producer . CJ Entertainment is set as the Korean distributor . CJ is also to handle international sales , ahead of a release anticipated in 2019 .
Aside from Song , who previously played lead roles in Bong 's “ The Host ” and “ Snowpiercer , ” “ Parasite ” also features Jang Hye-jin ( “ The World of Us ” ) as the wife . Park So-dam ( “ The Priests ” ) and “ Okja ” and “ Train to Busan ” star Choi Woo-shik appear as the couple 's children . The cast also includes veteran actors Lee Sun-kyun ( “ A Hard Day ” ) and Jo Yeo-jeong ( “ The Target ” ) .

REUTERS - Tottenham Hotspur will not give up on the Premier League title race midfielder Eric Dier has said , despite Saturday 's loss at Liverpool leaving them 10 points behind table-toppers Chelsea .
`` You never know in the Premier League , obviously Chelsea are doing very well and are in a good position but you can never say never , '' Dier told Sky Sports when asked if the third-placed north-London club 's title chase was over .
`` We 've always maintained we 're going to give everything in the competition , so you never know what can happen . It will be a very tough task . ''
Dier also felt it was important that young midfielder Dele Alli remained with the club , despite their 11 goals in 24 league appearances this season attracting interest from across Europe .
`` He 's still a very young boy , I think people need to remember that , '' Dier said . `` I think he 's at the perfect place because he 's got a support system around them and a manager and a group of players that will take care of him .
`` You have to worry about young players sometimes in certain places if they can cope with it and will they be looked after as a 20-year-old boy and not just an asset .
`` I think he 's very well looked after here and hopefully they will be for a long time . ''

Refinance rates drop for Tuesday
Posted : 9 am ET

Several closely watched refinance rates were down today .
The average rate nationwide for a 30-year fixed-rate refinance ticked downwards , but the average rate on a 15-year fixed climbed . The average rate on 10-year fixed refis , meanwhile , ticked downward .
RATE SEARCH : Compare refinancing rates in your area now .
30-year fixed refinance
The average 30-year fixed-refinance rate is 4.00 percent , down 5 basis points over the last seven days . A month ago , the average rate on a 30-year fixed refinance was higher , at 4.08 percent .
At the current average rate , you 'll pay $ 477.42 per month in principal and interest for every $ 100,000 you borrow . That represents a decline of $ 2.88 over what it would have been last week .
You can use Bankrate 's mortgage calculator to estimate your monthly payments and find out how much you 'll save by adding extra payments . It will also help you calculate how much interest you 'll pay over the life of the loan .
15-year fixed refinance
The 15-year fixed refi average rate is now 3.20 percent , up 1 basis points since the same time last week .
Monthly payments on a 15-year fixed refinance at that rate will cost around $ 698 per $ 100,000 borrowed . That 's clearly much higher than the monthly payment would be on a 30-year mortgage at that rate , but it comes with some big advantages : You 'll save thousands of dollars over the life of the loan in total interest paid and build equity much more rapidly .
10-year fixed refinance
The average rate for a 10-year fixed-refinance rate is 3.04 percent , down 4 basis points over the last seven days .
Monthly payments on a 10-year fixed-rate refi at 3.04 percent would cost $ 967.45 per month for every $ 100,000 you borrow . As you can see , the big savings in interest costs you 'll reap with that short 10-year term comes with the downside of a much larger monthly payment .

KABUL ( AFP ) – Militants launched a gun and bomb attack on the interior ministry in Kabul on Wednesday ( May 30 ) , killing one police officer and wounding at least five people , days after the Taleban vowed to target the Afghan capital .
Special forces rushed to the scene after the attackers detonated what police said was a car bomb at the first checkpoint leading to the ministry , then tried to fight their way inside .
“ The fighting is over , the attackers have all been killed by security forces between the first and second security perimeter , ” Kabul police chief Daud Amin said .
A security source told Agence France-Presse that a clearing operation was ongoing .
No group immediately claimed responsibility for the attack , and officials gave differing figures for the number of militants involved , with police saying three to five while interior ministry spokesperson Najib Danish said there were at least 10 .
Mr Danish also said one police officer had been killed and five people wounded .
“ The situation is under control now , ” they said , adding that there could be more explosions as police detonate suicide vests carried by the attackers .
“ I was in my office when I heard a blast followed by gunfire . We were told to stay inside our offices as the compound was attacked , ” one ministry employee told AFP earlier .
A security source told AFP there had been multiple blasts , though they could not confirm how many .
Police also said they had found a car stuffed with explosives and guns at Kabul 's international airport , which is near to the interior ministry , on Wednesday .
Both the Taleban and the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria have stepped up their attacks on Kabul , making it the deadliest place in the country for civilians in recent months .
Last week , the Taleban called on Kabul residents to stay away from military and intelligence centres in the capital , saying they planned more assaults as part of their annual spring offensive .
“ To avoid civilian casualties and only cause damage to enemy military , we are asking Kabul residents to keep away…we do n't want even a single innocent civilian to be killed , ” said a statement published online .
In response , the defence ministry said police and troops are “ ready to protect the people with all means possible ” , and would not allow the militants to reach their “ un-Islamic and inhuman goals ” .
The Taleban did not define what was meant by “ military and intelligence centres ” .
Such targets are difficult to avoid given that the heavily fortified city is the heart of the country 's intelligence , government and military operations and plagued by traffic jams due to ubiquitous checkpoints and barriers .
Kabul accounted for 16 per cent of all civilian casualties last year , when 1,831 civilians were killed or wounded nationwide , according to the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan .
The UN has warned that 2018 could be even deadlier .
LAHORE - Petarian Human Rights Organisation Chairman Ihsan Ali Khosa has strongly condemned Pakistan People 's Party MPA Ghulam Qadir Chandio 's remarks in the Sindh Assembly against the transgender community .
Yesterday , in the Sindh Assembly , Chandio criticised the Pakistan Tehreek e Insaf by saying , “ If the revolution was to be brought through dance , transgenders would have their own country. ” Later , their words were expunged by the deputy speaker .
Chairman of the Petarian Human Rights Organisation and Provincial Coordinator for the Sindh Transgender Network Ihsan Ali Khosa strongly condemned Chandio 's statement by saying , “ He has not only insulted the transgender community but challenged their dignity and gender equality . He , being the parliamentarian , is supposed to be talking of equal rights instead of ridiculing them . ”
Ihsan Ali said , “ We have written a letter to the speaker and secretary of the Sindh Assembly and asked for an unconditional apology from the MPA , otherwise we will come out on the streets . We are working on transgender rights and a bill is being formed at the moment , then how can they say such thing about them. ” They demanded an apology on behalf of the entire transgender community , “ We want Ghulam Qadir Chandio to apologize on the floor of the parliament because these people are feudal lords and they can get into personal animosity if we contact them directly. ” Punjab MPA Sadia Sohail of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf ( PTI ) condemned Chandio 's statement by saying , “ He has shown their character that they do not consider transgenders as humans or citizens of Pakistan . ”
Sadia said , “ He should tell what they did in the past 30 years for Sindh ? They should look at themselves before saying anything to PTI . We have brought about a revolution in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa that they have not been able to bring about in Sindh all these years . ”
Regarding music and dance , Sadia Sohail said , “ Those who say that we are dancing on music , have they forgotten patriotic songs were sung during the 1965 war ? These songs are to revive your emotions and patriotism and there is nothing wrong with them . ”

Former U.S. national team head coach Mark Schubert has responded to the civil lawsuit filed by Ariana Kukors , denying any wrongdoing and saying they reported rumors of abuse immediately when they heard them .
Kukors filed suit against Schubert , USA Swimming , their former coach Sean Hutchison and others earlier this month . The 2012 Olympian says Hutchison began grooming them when they were 13 and they took over as their coach at age 31 . They say Hutchison began sexually abusing them at 16 , and that USA Swimming ignored or covered up reports of an inappropriate relationship between them and their coach . Kukors named Schubert in the suit as well , alleging that they observed behaviors at the 2006 Pan Pacific Championships and 2007 World Championships that should have alerted them of an inappropriate coach-swimmer relationship .
Schubert has previously said they heard rumors about Hutchison and Kukors in 2010 , and says they reported them to Bill Jewell , the head coach at FAST , the club where the two were training . Jewell has since told the OC Register that they first heard the rumors and brought them to Schubert . Schubert told SwimSwam they heard the rumors and reported them to Jewell in late November of 2010 , and said any claims that Jewell first heard the rumors and enlisted Schubert 's help are false .
More background :
Schubert themselves provided SwimSwam with this statement on Wednesday :
Mark Schubert absolutely denies any wrongdoing . They are confident that when all the facts are known , the record will show that they never ignored , or turned a blind eye to , the abuse of an athlete . When Coach Schubert first became aware of the rumors of abuse , they reported them immediately and sought to make sure they were properly investigated . Coach Schubert had and continues to have no tolerance for anyone who would harm a minor or violate the trust that athletes and their parents place in their coaches .
Throughout their career , Coach Schubert has always placed what is best for the athletes first and foremost . It has been the great honor of their professional life to work with terrific young people – not just the Olympic champions and world record holders , but thousands of great kids who have learned about discipline , commitment , and hard work through swimming . Helping them achieve their goals , no matter how big or small , is why they continue to coach after 46 years .
Los Angeles tourism officials are launching an advertising campaign Tuesday with the message “ Everyone is welcome ” — a clear response to President Trump 's proposed travel ban .
The campaign features a 93-second music video showing people of various ethnic backgrounds hugging , dancing and skateboarding near iconic L.A. tourism spots including the Original Farmer 's Market , Walt Disney Concert Hall , Venice Beach and Olvera Street .
As “ Real Love Baby ” by Father John Misty plays , two young men share a kiss on a rainbow-colored staircase and a jogger greets a friend sitting on a restaurant patio in a wheelchair , holding the world 's calmest Chihuahua .
The video will play on the social media sites for Discover Los Angeles , the tourism board for the region . It will also appear in social media feeds in Canada , Mexico , China , Britain and Australia . Discover Los Angeles does n't have any plans currently to buy TV advertising time for the message .
Although the video does n't mention Trump by name or attack their travel bans , Los Angeles tourism officials said the campaign was intended to fight the message that L.A. does n't welcome foreign visitors .
“ Diversity and inclusivity have always been cornerstones of Los Angeles culture , but there has never been a more crucial time to reinforce these points , ” said Ernest Wooden Jr. , chief executive of Discover Los Angeles .
Trump has attempted to impose two travel bans , both temporarily prohibiting visitors from largely Muslim countries . Both have been blocked by federal courts , pending reviews .
Travel industry experts say they fear that Trump 's bans have sent the message that the U.S. — home to a $ 2.1-trillion travel industry — is n't open to all tourists .
There is yet no conclusive data to show that travel has dropped since Trump 's most recent ban was announced . However , a survey of 324 corporate travel managers from the U.S. and Europe found that 37 % of U.S. travel managers expect the new ban will reduce travel to the U.S. while 47 % of European managers said they expect a reduction .
The survey , conducted on behalf of the Global Business Travel Assn. , a trade group for the world 's business travel managers , also found that the ban made 34 % of travel managers worried about harassment of U.S. travelers visiting the Middle East .
Los Angeles County hosted 47.3 million visitors last year , representing the sixth consecutive year of record-breaking tourism .
In L.A. County , an “ anti-welcome ” message could mean the loss of 800,000 international visitors over a three-year period , according to a forecast by Tourism Economics , an independent research firm . International visitors spend an average of about $ 920 during each visit Los Angeles , totaling a potential loss of $ 736 million in direct tourism spending .

STEUBEN COUNTY , Ind . ( WOWO ) – Four people were taken to a local hospital after a crash in Steuben County Sunday morning .
Steuben County Deputies were dispatched to a crash on southbound I-69 at mile marker 346 around 2:46 a.m .
Once at the scene , Deputies found a Green 2004 Chevrolet Avalanche on its top in the median .
It 's been determined that the vehicle left the roadway , entering the median , and struck a cable barrier which caused it to roll over onto its top .
Three juvenile passengers , ages three , 10 , and 11 , were transported to Cameron Hospital where they were treated and released .
Another passenger , an adult woman , was transported to Cameron Hospital and later transferred to Parkview Regional Medical Center .
The driver , 32-year-old Brandy Morehouse of Ashley , was arrested for operating a vehicle while intoxicated .
The crash remains under investigation .
Facebook is facing backlash after a Cleveland man uploaded a video of themselves shooting someone to the social network , and followed it with a Live video confessing to the murder . The slaying and its subsequent distribution across Facebook has raised questions about how the company moderates violent content .
Justin Osofsky , Facebook 's vice president of global operations , released a statement and timeline of the events and videos surrounding the incident .
Osofsky 's statements hand off the responsibility for policing content on Facebook to its users , although they acknowledged the company can do better at moderation . They say artificial intelligence and new policies governing how videos are shared could present solutions to the issue , and that Facebook will try to speed up its current review process .
“ As a result of this terrible series of events , we are reviewing our reporting flows to be sure people can report videos and other material that violates our standards as easily and quickly as possible . In this case , we did not receive a report about the first video , and we only received a report about the second video — containing the shooting — more than an hour and 45 minutes after it was posted . We received reports about the third video , containing the man 's live confession , only after it had ended , ” Osofsky wrote .
11:09AM PDT — First video , of intent to murder , uploaded . Not reported to Facebook .
11:11AM PDT — Second video , of shooting , uploaded .
11:22AM PDT — Suspect confesses to murder while using Live , is live for 5 minutes .
11:27AM PDT — Live ends , and Live video is first reported shortly after .
12:59PM PDT — Video of shooting is first reported .
1:22PM PDT — Suspect 's account disabled ; all videos no longer visible to public .
The timeline demonstrates the failures of Facebook 's moderation system , which relies on user reports to flag controversial or violent content . While the Live video of the man 's confession was quickly reported by another user , the video of the killing itself went unreported and therefore remained online for nearly two hours .
“ Artificial intelligence , for example , plays an important part in this work , helping us prevent the videos from being reshared in their entirety . ( People are still able to share portions of the videos in order to condemn them or for public awareness , as many news outlets are doing in reporting the story online and on television ) , ” Osofsky said .
Even with advances in artificial intelligence , it 's not clear that Facebook can prevent Live from being used to broadcast violence . The livestreaming service has already been used to share videos of shootings , torture , and sexual assault . And while users are angry at Facebook for allowing the Cleveland killing to be livestreamed , users were also outraged when a “ technical glitch ” caused the removal of video documenting the police murder of Philando Castile . Osofsky says that the Cleveland videos “ goes against our policies and everything we stand for , ” but there are times when users will expect Facebook to preserve violent videos because they have political importance . It 's a delicate balance , and one that is n't likely to be solved by AI alone .
“ Facebook is n't going to stop a murder . And I do n't care how good the AI gets , it 's unlikely any time soon to say ‘ hey , that video is some person killing another person , do n't stream that . ' ” Mike Masnick noted on Techdirt . “ Yes , senseless murders and violence lead people to go searching for answers , but sometimes there are no answers . And demanding answers from a random tool that was peripherally used connected to the senseless violence does n't seem helpful at all . ”

LAHORE , Jul 04 ( APP ) : Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz leader Hamza Shehbaz Sharif held meetings with party ticket holders and senior leaders at Model Town secretariat here Wednesday .
Talking to them , they said the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz would defeat its political rivals in the upcoming general election .
They said the PML-N was the single popular party of the country and it would form the next government . They said the Muslim League-Nawaz government during its five years tenure had completed dozens of mega development projects in the country which was an ample proof of its selfless public service .
Hamza said holding fair , free and transparent polls was the only solution to strengthen the country .
For the first time , the fired state worker who sent a false missile alert is speaking out .
On Saturday , Jan. 13 , at 8:07 a.m. , a Hawaii Emergency Management Agency employee mistakenly sent a statewide emergency alert to cell phones that read : “ Ballistic missile threat inbound to Hawaii . Seek immediate shelter . This is not a drill . ”
The alert created widespread panic , and a follow-up alert was n't sent until 38 minutes later : “ There is no missile threat or danger to the State of Hawaii . Repeat . False Alarm . ”
The worker was fired on Friday , Jan. 26 , nearly two weeks after the incident .
“ It seemed very real from the start , and the message that I heard was . ‘ This is not a drill . ' When the phone call came in , someone picked up the receiver instead of hitting speaker phone so that everyone could hear the message . So I could n't hear the message , the beginning of the message saying ‘ Exercise , exercise , exercise . ' I heard the part ‘ This is not a drill , ' and then I did n't hear exercise at all , in the message or from my coworkers , up until the point where I sent the alert out , ” they said .
They say they feel guilty about what happened .
“ I felt sick afterwards . It was like a body blow . At the time , with the information I had , I was 100-percent sure it was the right decision . I did what I was trained to do , ” they said . “ It was a fast-paced , rather chaotic office at the time . They were kind of rushing through things , and the energy felt different than drills previously . ”
They say their supervisors never asked them what happened until days later . That 's when they issued a written statement .
They say it was n't true the did n't want to cooperate with the investigation . They just are n't able to , because they could n't go to work after realizing what they had done .
Retired Brig . Gen. Bruce Oliveira , who spearheaded the internal investigation , said the employee had performance issues in the past , and there were at least two incidents where they mistakenly thought a drill was an actual event .
“ That 's a mystery to me , ” the employee said . “ I was never counseled about any mistakes . Nothing was documented about them . I did n't sign off on any type of drill mistakes that I made . When I read about it in the news , it was hurtful . ”

The California Department of Corrections says guards have been injured by prisoners in two assaults at Kern Valley State Prison .
The first assault occurred about 6:40 a.m. Monday when an inmate refused to go into a cell and punched one of two escorting officers , knocking one downstairs .
The department says another inmate ran out of the cell and joined the attack , which was quelled by less-lethal rounds , pepper spray , physical force and a baton .
One officer was hospitalized for a broken sinus and an inmate was treated for a head injury .
Thirty minutes later , an inmate punched an officer in the face while returning to a cell , drawing use of force .
Several officers were injured but did n't need outside hospitalization . The inmate was treated for facial injuries .
The Nets on Tuesday announced that former Knicks point guard Pablo Prigioni will join coach Kenny Atkinson 's staff , and Tiago Splitter , who spent five seasons with the Spurs , has been hired as a pro scout with added duties related to player development .
Prigioni , a native of Argentina , and Splitter , a native of Brazil , were teammates for several seasons with Baskonia in the Spanish ACB League before moving to the NBA late in their careers . They add even more international diversity to the Nets ' organization .
Prigioni , who was a regular guest at Nets practices last season , enjoyed a pro career spanning 20-plus seasons in Argentina , Spain and the NBA . In 2012 at age 35 , they became the oldest rookie in NBA history when they joined the Knicks for two-plus seasons before they were traded to Houston in 2015 and played for the Clippers in 2015-16 . They were part of Argentina 's bronze-medal team at the 2008 Olympics in Beijing .
Splitter played for Baskonia from 1999-2010 . The Spurs took them in the first round of the 2007 NBA Draft , and they joined them in 2010 and spent five seasons in San Antonio before playing their final two NBA seasons in Atlanta and Philadelphia . They won gold medals with the Brazilian national team in the FIBA AmeriCup , the Pan American Games and the South American Championships .
What 's missing is the nuclear power of Cynthia Erivo , who won a Tony for their performance in Doyle 's production as poor , put-upon Celie , the protagonist of Walker 's novel played by Whoopi Goldberg in the Steven Spielberg film and LaChanze in the musical 's first outing on Broadway . At the Pantages , the role is assayed by Adrianna Hicks , an ensemble player in the Broadway revival who has n't quite made the leap to headliner .
A 92-year-old man was arrested Tuesday on suspicion of fatally shooting their wife during a dispute , Los Angeles police said .

BISMARCK , N.D. ( AP )  It probably will take until next spring for the Army Corps of Engineers to finish court-ordered additional environmental study of the Dakota Access oil pipeline , agency attorneys said in court documents filed Friday .
The Corps had anticipated completing the task by the end of the year , but Justice Department attorney Matthew Marinelli said it will take longer than expected to get needed information including spill modeling from Texas-based pipeline developer Energy Transfer Partners and possibly from at least one unspecified American Indian tribe .
`` Given the current expected time frame for the receipt of additional information , the Corps now anticipates that its review and analysis ... will not conclude until approximately April 2 , 2018 , '' Marinelli wrote .
The $ 3.8 billion pipeline began carrying oil from North Dakota through South Dakota and Iowa to a distribution point in Illinois on June 1 . However , four Sioux tribes in the Dakotas continue challenging it in federal court in Washington , D.C. , because they fear a leak could contaminate their water supply . The pipeline crosses beneath the Lake Oahe reservoir on the Missouri River just to the north of the Standing Rock Reservation that straddles the North Dakota-South Dakota border .

`` The notice says they are conducting additional oil spill modeling in other words , this was n't done before the Trump administration approved ( the pipeline ) , '' tribal Chairman Dave Archambault said Friday in a statement to The Associated Press . `` This confirms what we 've been saying from the start  until there 's been a full analysis of risks and impacts to the Standing Rock tribe , the pipeline should be shut down . ''
U.S. District Judge James Boasberg is considering halting pipeline operations while the additional study is done . It 's not known when he 'll rule .
Boasberg ruled on June 14 that the Corps largely complied with environmental law in giving its permission for the pipeline project , but that it did n't adequately consider how an oil spill under Lake Oahe might affect the Standing Rock tribe . They also said the Corps did n't adequately study how the pipeline might disproportionately affect the tribal community  a concept known as environmental justice . That aims to ensure development projects are n't built in areas where minority populations might not have the resources to defend their rights . Boasberg ordered the Corps to reconsider those issues .
The Corps is `` actively working on ways to shorten '' the new April timeline for completing the work , Marinelli said .

Right now , an interstellar object dubbed ‘ Oumuamua is hurtling through space on its way out of our solar system . I say ‘ interstellar object ' because there is a shadow of a doubt about whether or not this object was formed naturally . Moreover , it 's the first object to fly through our solar system that is believed to have originated in another star system .
Its shape , about 800 meters long and only 80 wide , is another head-scratcher for astronomers , who are perplexed by the fact that it has no comet-like tail of melting ice . This suggests it may be composed of other material , perhaps solid rock or even metal . Oh , and it 's spinning about three times each earth day , leading scientists to believe that it 's not some gravitationally bound pack of rocks but a solid object .
Long story short , this thing is bizarre enough to warrant some further exploration .
If you follow space news , you 've surely already heard about ‘ Oumuamua , which was discovered in October as it passed by Earth . But today , Breakthrough Listen confirmed that it will spend 10 hours listening to ‘ Oumuamua across four radio bands , from 1GHz to 12GHz , using the Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope in West Virginia . Observation will begin on Wednesday , December 13 at 3pm ET .
Why ?
Here 's what the press release had to say :
Researchers working on long-distance space transportation have previously suggested that a cigar or needle shape is the most likely architecture for an interstellar spacecraft , since this would minimize friction and damage from interstellar gas and dust . While a natural origin is more likely , there is currently no consensus on what that origin might have been , and Breakthrough Listen is well positioned to explore the possibility that ‘ Oumuamua could be an artifact .
Breakthrough Listen is one facet of Yuri Milner 's $ 100 million search for intelligent extraterrestrial life .
“ With our equipment at Green Bank , we can detect a signal the strength of a mobile phone coming out of this object , ” Milner told Scientific American . “ We do n't want to be sensational in any way , and we are very realistic about the chances this is artificial , but because this is a unique situation we think humankind can afford 10 hours of observing time using the best equipment on the planet to check a low-probability hypothesis . ”
Alongside Breakthrough Listen , which uses two of the world 's most powerful telescopes to listen to the universe , Breakthrough Initiatives is also working on a more proactive method of finding extraterristrial intelligent life . Breakthrough Starshot includes a collection of gram-scale nanocraft spaceships , equipped with sensors , a laser to transmit information back to Earth , robotics to steer , and a camera . These spaceships wo n't be propelled by a rocket , but by an ultra-powerful laser and light sails .
In July , the earliest prototypes for Starshot , called Sprites , were sent into low-earth orbit after hitching a ride aboard the Max Valier and Venta satellites .
Unfortunately , that project wo n't be ready in time to chase ‘ Oumuamua .
Two men arrested after being released from a Georgia hospital will return to Alabama where they 'll face charges in connection with the March 9 Auburn Mall parking lot shooting , the Auburn Police Department confirmed Monday .
Michael Ryan Trimble , 21 , of Montgomery , and Deion Sandell Brooks , 23 , of Waldorf , Maryland , are both charged with first-degree assault and reckless endangerment .
Both were taken by medical helicopter to a Columbus , Georgia , hospital where they were treated for non-life-threatening injuries .
Trimble was released from the hospital on Friday while Brooks was discharged Monday . Both were immediately taken into custody by the Muscogee County Sheriff 's Office , located just over the Alabama line .
Both opted to waive extradition and have since been transported back to the Lee County Jail .
In addition to both having bonds set at $ 51,000 , Trimble is also being held for a probation violation on a previous felony conviction . Court records indicate Trimble has a lengthy criminal history and was out on probation at the time of the shooting . Records indicate the judge has since revoked their bond in a 2017 felony case that involved four counts in which they were sentenced as late as Nov. 30 .
The two met each other , by their own accounts , for conflicting and unlawful reasons resulting in each firing at each other in the Auburn Mall parking lot , according to an Auburn police investigation .
The assault charges stem from them seriously injuring each other and the charges of reckless endangerment was brought because of their actions placing others at risk .
The case remains under investigation .

A man is looking for answers from the Halifax Regional Municipality after an accident at a local park forced them to euthanize their dog .
Mike Goneau said they were at the Mainland Common dog park on Saturday with their Bernese Mountain Dog named Bear .
They said Bear was sniffing around in a grassy area of the park when all of a sudden they let out a horrible cry .
“ I rushed down to him . They had fallen into the pit hole , ” said Goneau .
“ He was screaming quite badly . I had to pick them up and carry them to the parking lot and take them to the emergency vet . ”

A visit to the vet confirmed that Bear had broken their shoulder bone . Goneau was told that due to Bear 's age and size , it was unlikely they would ever be able to recover from the injury .
They had no choice but to put the dog down .
“ I cried all Saturday afternoon . And every time yesterday , a piece of fur would go by or if I was moving their dish… I relive the moment , ” said Goneau , adding that while nothing will ever bring Bear back , they want to make sure something like this never happens to another family again .

The hole that Bear fell into is one of several in the grassy area along the fence at the Mainland Common park .
George Hickey is part of a group of concerned dog owners who have been trying to get the city to fix the holes for months .
Hickey met with councillors Russell Walker and Richard Zurawski at the park on June 27 to try and expedite the issue .

“ This is almost going on two months now with numerous emails that went unanswered and we keep hearing the response that ‘ it goes back to staff , ” Hickey said .
“ This situation could have been avoided . You 're talking about an hour with a weed whacker to clear some brush and you 're talking an hour or so with a backhoe and a Bobcat to fill the holes . ”

They said the municipality needs to accept responsibility for the accident and take immediate action to prevent any further incidents from happening .
“ It 's heartbreaking that this had to happen , ” Hickey said .
“ I would have expected them to be here first thing this morning and I would expect somebody to talk to [ Goneau ] and say ‘ look , we 're really sorry that we dropped the ball on you ' . ”
A spokesperson from the Halifax Regional Municipality said they are aware of the incident .

When it comes to the 2018 Jeep Wrangler , we 've already seen fan renderings like the one shown above . We 've caught it testing nearly undisguised and have also gotten a peek at the interior . Plus , thanks to an alleged leak , we think we know what the options list will look like . Now there may be a new leak , this time revealing how much power two engine options will make .
This information comes to us from the admins at JLWranglerForums.com , a fan forum we generally trust to vet its sources . In documents that Fiat Chrysler allegedly submitted to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration , we see two particularly interesting bits of information—the horsepower figures for the upcoming Wrangler 's V-6 and I-4 engines . The 285 hp we see listed for the 3.6-liter V-6 is no different than what you 'll find in the current Wrangler . But what 's truly shocking is how much power it says the 2.0-liter turbo makes .
If this post is to be believed , the turbocharged Wrangler will make 368 hp . That would make it almost as powerful as the turbocharged-to-hell-and-back Mercedes-AMG CLA45 . And at 184 hp per liter , it would have a specific output that puts the Honda S2000 to shame . Granted , comparing turbocharged and naturally aspirated engines is n't exactly fair , but it does show how far engine technology has come in only a few years .
Others are already reporting that they 've heard the rumor is false , but when we reached out to FCA for a comment , the spokesperson could n't say anything either way . At this point , consider us skeptical . Very skeptical . Even if the documents are the actual ones that were submitted to NHTSA , the horsepower figure for the 2.0-liter could still be a typo . But if it did end up being true , we 'd be completely OK with that .
After all , more power is , well , more .

The learning experience of pupils at a Hartlepool primary school has been improved after it bagged hi-tech equipment worth thousands of pounds as part of a national competition .
Stranton Primary School in the town recently won a state-of-the-art education technology package from the Promethean Grant .
The Promethean Grant was a UK-wide initiative where schools were asked to submit creative entries as to why they should receive a Promethean ActivPanel – an advanced interactive display for front of classrooms .
The school has now been chosen as one of the 30 winners from over 250 entries in total following their submission , which even included a short video appeal .
The competition ran during the last school year , and the winners ' new ActivPanels were installed in time for start of the current academic year .

Year 6 teacher Anthony Emms , was particularly happy about the school 's win as their classroom was chosen to receive the new ActivPanel .
Alex Duxfield , who is ICT technician at the school , said : “ Mr Emms is overjoyed to have the panel in their class , they used to have to go to other classrooms every time they wanted to use an interactive panel because their old one was so temperamental .
“ The competition was something we had to get involved with , it 's such a great opportunity and the children loved taking part .
“ With school budgets being squeezed , it was amazing to win the ActivPanel . ”

The Tennessee Titans are taking a page from the `` no duh '' playbook .
The Titans exercised quarterback Marcus Mariota 's fifth-year contract option Tuesday , a source informed of the situation told NFL Network Insider Ian Rapoport . The move comes after general manager Jon Robinson said on 104.5 The Zone in Nashville last week that the team was planning to exercise the option , which keeps Mariota in Tennessee through the 2019 season .
The No . 2 overall pick in 2015 was never going anywhere .
The Titans franchise cornerstone , Mariota owns the traits to be among the top signal-callers in the NFL for the next decade . The biggest concern for the 24-year-old quarterback is health . Mariota has yet to play a full 16-game regular-season slate in their three-year career .
Tennessee fired coach Mike Mularkey this offseason in large part to help unlock Mariota 's potential . The grind-out style preferred by the previous coaching staff pigeonholed a quarterback who excels in a quick-pass scheme and owns superior athleticism as a runner .
The Titans hope importing offensive coordinator Matt LaFleur will unleash Mariota , similar to Jared Goff 's big stride forward under Sean McVay in Los Angeles , where LaFleur was OC last season .
With the formality of picking up the fifth-year option done , sides could begin to work out a long-term contract -- though that likely wo n't come to pass until next offseason at the earliest .

CIA Director Mike Pompeo . ( AP-Yonhap )
WASHINGTON -- US intelligence does not indicate an imminent nuclear war with North Korea , the chief of the Central Intelligence Agency said Sunday , after a week of bellicose rhetoric between the two sides.In an interview on `` Fox News Sunday , '' CIA Director Mike Pompeo said they would not be surprised if North Korea carried out another missile test to advance its missile and nuclear programs.But they rejected talk of the US being on the `` cusp of nuclear war . `` `` I 've seen no intelligence to indicate we 're in that place today , '' Pompeo said.North Korea , according to the director , has been moving at an `` ever alarming rate '' to develop nuclear-tipped ballistic missiles . `` Each time they test another missile , or if they should conduct a nuclear weapons test , they develop expertise . They expand the envelope , '' they said.US President Donald Trump has made clear how the US will respond to North Korea 's provocations , and hopefully , the regime will understand , Pompeo added.Trump warned last week that North Korea would be met with `` fire and fury '' if it continued to threaten their country . In response , North Korea announced a detailed plan to fire ballistic missiles towards Guam , a US territory in the Pacific . `` This administration has made our policy very clear . We 've engaged the world to support that policy , '' Pompeo said , adding there will no longer be `` strategic patience , '' the policy of former President Barack Obama , which centered on waiting for Pyongyang to return to denuclearization talks while increasing sanctions and pressure on the regime.Pompeo described the North 's leader , Kim Jong-un , as `` rational . `` `` He responds to adverse circumstances , '' they said.In a separate interview on ABC News , Trump 's national security adviser , H.R . McMaster , struck a similar tone.He said they do n't think the US is closer to war than a week ago , but closer to war than a decade ago . `` Our response is we are prepared militarily to deal with this if necessary . But we 're taking all possible actions short of military action to resolve this very grave threat to the United States and the world , '' the lieutenant general said , citing diplomatic efforts , increased sanctions and increased pressure.He played down the gravity of Trump 's tweet Friday that the US military is `` locked and loaded '' to respond to North Korea 's threats . `` The United States military is always locked and loaded , '' they said . `` But the purpose of capable , ready forces is to preserve peace and prevent war . And George Washington said it . The most effective way of preserving peace is to be prepared for war . `` On whether North Korea 's threats alone could provoke a military response , they responded : '' Well , it depends on the nature of the threat , right ? And so this is why what Kim Jong-un is doing is very , very dangerous . '' ( Yonhap )

Patio Unplugged : The Bassic sing of teenage suffering and are reminiscent of your favorite pop-rock groups
The Bassic , a four-piece all-girl group from Mumbai , will remind you of a number of pop-rock sensations , like 5 Seconds of Summer . Comprising of Alezzandra ( vocals , rhythm guitar ) , Aarifah ( drums ) , Brunelle ( bass ) and Sianna ( lead guitarist , keyboards ) — this band has incorporated the sound of standard pop-rock anthems into their own music . In a new episode of Patio Unplugged , the group gets together to play two of their singles , 'Bad Influence ' , and 'Never ' .
'Bad Influence '
The first track is guitar and bass-driven and is reminiscent of something Avril Lavigne would make in the early 2000s if their music was stripped of all pop-punk elements . 'Bad Influence ' is a simple track which moves forward with formulaic guitar chords and a catchy bass line . The chorus of the song is catchy and almost sticks in your head after a few casual listens . Alezzandra , the vocalist of the band , forms the backbone of the track with their consistent and pleasant voice . The lyrics deal with the topics that any teenager would relate to : Indulging in something that is bad for you , but you do it anyway .
You can hear the track here :
'Never '
The second track , titled 'Never ' , is mellower , softer , and even more measured in its execution . The song is propelled forward by a simple keyboard melody and is adorned by the harmonising vocals of Alezzandra and the bassist Brunelle . The structure of the song is similar to any mid-2000 's pop anthem and sounds eerily like a Boyzone track with its familiar flow and transitions . While the guitars are kept to the minimum in the acoustic version of the track , the bass and the keyboards complement each other well , giving the song a pop ballad kind of feel . The falsetto of the singer 's voice , coupled with the lingering drone of the bass guitar differentiates this track from the previous one . These are the type of songs that will pull-off being a straight-up pop-rock track when performed with full-fledged instruments .

The Ministry of Youth and Sports have felt the need to clear the air on growing reports of tension between Sports Minister Isaac Asiamah and suspended Deputy Minister Pius Hadzide .
The two have not been spotted together in public since the Australia Commonwealth Games Visa racketeering debacle that has rocked the country .
As head of the International Games Committee for Ghana during the competition , Deputy Sports Minister Pius Hadzide is currently under suspension pending investigations into the matter by the CID .
Since their suspension there has been no public show of support from Isaac Asiamah the Minister , further fueling reports from veteran journalist Abdul Malik Kweku Baako that the two men are indeed at loggerheads .
The Editor-in-Chief of the New Crusading Guide stated on Peace Fm 's Kokrokoo that all has not been well between the two for some time .
“ Right at the Ministry , at the very top , there 's some little conflict . There 's some friction at the very top . Yes , I think they 've been at loggerheads .
However , Spokesperson for the Sports Ministry Elvis Adjei Baah has rubbished the claims and insists that individuals are capitalizing on the current investigations into the Commonwealth debacle to sow seeds of discord .
There is a very cordial relationship between the Minister and their Deputy .
If you recall during our Meet the Press you heard the words that the Minister spoke about their deputy .
How their Deputy is an able lieutenant to them and how they are proud of them and even to trust the deputy Minister with this huge task of organizing the competition .
It is unfortunate that things did not go as planned .
I do n't believe that there is any friction but what happened is unfortunate and people are taking advantage to cast these insinuations , ” they revealed .
The ongoing investigation into the matter has also led to the suspension of Acting Director General of the National Sports Authority , Robert Sarfo Mensah as well as NSA Board Chairman , Kojo Baah Agyemang .
The Dollar General Store in southern Pike County was robbed Friday night .
Pike County sheriff 's deputies say an unidentified man walked in just before closing time and robbed the place . The armed man was wearing a hoodie , a bandanna over their face and black gloves , and they demanded money . The suspect first approached an employee who was new on the job .
`` He went to the office area . They were a brand-new employee , so they were a little addled about how to open a cash register under such stress . Another employee , a female , came over and opened one of the cash registers at which time the unidentified black male took their left hand with the gun in their right hand and took all paper currency , '' said Capt . Bob Williamson of the Pike County Sheriff 's Department .
Williamson says the man got away with around $ 800 in cash . So far , the suspect has not been captured .
No one was injured in the armed robbery .

Aamir Khan says artistes have a responsibility to highlight gender issues
New Delhi : As sexual harassment scandals rock Hollywood , superstar Aamir Khan says creative people have an important role to play in changing mindsets on gender issues .
The actor , whose recent films Dangal and Secret Superstar focused on female empowerment , also believes that the issues are directly linked to patriarchy .
`` I think sexual harassment is a very sad thing to happen to anyone , irrespective of what your sex is . Sexual harassment is just not on , '' they said when asked about the Harvey Weinstein case .
Such cases , they said , happened not just in the world of films , but in other areas , too .
`` I understand that people are free to be romantically involved with whoever they want . But you can not pressure a person into being with you physically . It happens not only in films but in all walks of life and is very unfortunate , '' Aamir , who is currently shooting for Thugs of Hindostan in Thailand , told PTI in an exclusive telephonic interview .
The New York Times and The New Yorker took the lid off Weinstein 's history of sexual abuse , encouraging prominent women such as Gwyneth Paltrow , Angelina Jolie , Ashley Judd and Rose McGowan to open up about the disgraced producer . The scandal led to the expose of other Hollywood heavyweights .
Aamir said sexual harassment should not be looked into isolation as it is connected to larger issues of how gender roles have been defined in society . They also believe that creative people have an important role to play in changing such perspectives .
`` It is connected to the larger issue . Not only in India but all over the world , ( it is ) this thinking of patriarchy that men are stronger or are more important that leads to various kind of things . Sexual harassment is one of them , '' they said .
The actor-producer believes that artistes help mould opinion . `` Creative people do have a role to play in showcasing men and women in a manner that influences people in the right way . I do believe we have some sort of responsibility in that , '' they said .
Many of their films have dealt with issues of empowerment .
Dangal focused on a father 's decision to turn their daughters into wrestlers in a patriarchal society , while Secret Superstar revolved around a teen 's struggle to pursue music despite facing opposition from their father .
The actor highlighted issues that women face in India in their TV show Satyamev Jayate . In Secret Superstar , they said , they went a step forward by portraying a girl who asserts their independence and helps their mother do the same .
`` I am hoping that things will change in the future for the better . It takes time both for the people and the society to change . ''
Women 's issues , they said , span a big canvas .
`` When we look at women 's issues , it is not just about female foeticide and domestic violence , which are huge issues . But even in day-to-day life , women sometimes find that they are not in the possession of their own decisions , '' they said .
A woman may not be sexually harassed or face domestic violence , but there may be a host of other issues .
`` She may still be with a man who wants to control them and that is equally disturbing . It is really about the fundamental independence of a person , irrespective of your sex . ''
Secret Superstar , starring Dangal actor Zaira Wasim in the lead role , may have been seen by some as a risky business venture in the formula-driven film industry , but Aamir , who has been rewriting the rules of the box office , said they felt strongly about the subject .
The movie has not only done good business in India but has also opened well in countries such as Taiwan .
Aamir , whose Dangal was a super hit in China , is now looking forward to the release of Secret Supertar there . They hope the film will be released there in January or February next year .
`` Secret Superstar has done really well in all the territories . I strongly felt about the story and I am happy that the audiences felt the same . It is most reassuring . ''
The actor is considered a marketing genius in Bollywood as none of their films in the last many years has failed at the box office . But Aamir said it all boiled down to how good a story was .
`` When I am selecting a film , I am not thinking about the box office or the audiences ' reaction . I am reacting to it personally . When I get a script and love it as a person , it touches me and moves me , makes me laugh and cry or excites me , then I want to be a part of it . ''
They select films based on their personal response to the story , they added .
`` For me , filmmaking is a journey . In most of the cases , the films I end up choosing are very risky . I do n't plan it that way but it turns out that way . My taste is a little unusual and I get excited about stuff which is not considered mainstream by the market . ''
Aamir said they looked at marketing as an intrinsic part of making a film rather than treating it as a separate process .
`` I find the journey of making the film as exciting as the end result . I do one film in a year or sometimes one film in two years . So the process is what excites me ... I am living that journey for a year or so . It becomes my life and it is a passion for me .
They believe they are `` fortunate '' that the unusual stories they have picked up have done well at the box office .
`` That is something I do n't plan . Taare Zameen Par was one of the top hits of that year and did huge business at that time . When films like Secret Superstar do well , it makes me very happy . As a creative person , you feel reassured . You get a lot of encouragement and strength . ''
The United States is advancing toward the first transfer of a prisoner from the Guantanamo Bay detention center under U.S. President Donald Trump , the U.S. military told Reuters on Monday , a move that would repatriate the detainee to Saudi Arabia .
The transfer of 43-year-old Ahmed Muhammed Haza al-Darbi appeared to have stalled in February , when they became eligible but was not repatriated , as allowed under the terms of al-Darbi 's 2014 plea bargain agreement .

The U.S. military said at the time it was waiting for assurances from Saudi Arabia 's government to move forward on their departure .
WATCH : Donald Trump says he 's keeping Guantanamo Bay open and will fill it up with ‘ bad dudes '
On Monday , the Pentagon suggested that process was back on track . Navy Commander Sarah Higgins , a spokesperson , said the Defense Department was “ reviewing information received from Saudi Arabia regarding al-Darbi 's transfer . ”
“ The transfer process is moving forward , ” Higgins said . “ I have no further information on transfer timing . ”
They did not elaborate .
Al-Darbi 's transfer would decrease the prisoner population at the detention center in Cuba to 40 from 41 – despite Trump ‘ s campaign pledge to “ to load it up with some bad dudes . ”

The prison , which was opened by Republican President George W. Bush to hold terrorism suspects captured overseas after the Sept. 11 , 2001 , attacks came to symbolize harsh detention practices that opened the United States to accusations of torture .
U.S. officials have not ruled out again adding to the prisoner population and have acknowledged trouble repatriating Islamic State fighters being held by U.S.-backed forces in Syria , raising the possibility that Guantanamo Bay could be seen as a viable option in the future .

The news of progress in al-Darbi 's case came before a high-profile trip to Washington by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman , their first visit to the United States as Saudi heir apparent .
The crown prince is due to meet Trump at the White House on Tuesday , in a visit that is expected to see both countries publicly emphasize their strong security ties , even as those ties come under intensifying scrutiny in Congress .
‘ MESSAGE OF HOPE '
Al-Darbi became eligible for repatriation under the terms of their 2014 plea bargain agreement , in which they admitted to their role in a 2002 attack of against a French-flagged oil tanker off the coast of Yemen , and agreed to cooperate with U.S. authorities . They have been held at Guantanamo Bay for 15 years .

Ramzi Kassem , a law professor at the City University of New York who has been al-Darbi 's lead defense counsel since 2008 , told Reuters that a Trump administration move to honor the 2014 agreement would be significant and would be noticed by other inmates .
“ Mr . Darbi 's transfer to Saudi custody would send a qualified message of hope to other prisoners that leaving Guantanamo is possible , ” Kassem said .
They said the message was qualified in part because “ the U.S. government has no interest in prosecuting three quarters of the detainees left today , ” which would make them ineligible for such agreements .
Critics of the U.S. military detention system say that militants can be best prosecuted in civilian courts and have seized on the high costs of housing inmates at Guantanamo Bay as one argument why indefinite detention is misguided .
Trump ‘ s predecessor , Barack Obama , reduced the inmate population to 41 from 242 , but fell short of fulfilling their promise to close the jail before leaving office last year .
Trump signed an order in January to keep the Guantanamo Bay detention center open and hinted in their State of the Union address to Congress that Islamic State or al Qaeda fighters could be added to the prison population
Trump also asked the Pentagon to re-examine the U.S. military 's detention policy .

The U.S. military has long struggled with what to do about prisoners of war in an open-ended battle against Islamist extremism , in which militants have come from all corners of the world to fight in places like Syria .
In February , U.S. officials expressed concerns about the lack of a clear path on how to deal with foreign fighters for Islamic State who were detained by the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces .
U.S. officials say there are hundreds of foreign fighters and thousands of Syrian Islamic State militants in SDF hands .

Pro-Kannada organisations called off the bandh in Bengaluru on Sunday , which was meant to coincide with Prime Minister Narendra Modi 's election rally in the city , after the Karnataka High Court on Friday termed it `` unconstitutional '' .
The high court stayed the bandh , called by pro-Kannada farmers ' groups in the city , on Sunday on the Mahadayi water dispute issue . Passing an interim order , a division bench of acting Chief Justice HG Ramesh and Justice PS Dinesh Kumar asked the Siddaramaiah government to take appropriate steps to prevent breakdown of law and order on that date .
The same pro-Kannada organisations had called for the shutdown last week during BJP chief Amit Shah 's visit to the state . The protesters will instead observe a `` black day '' on Sunday , reported News18 .
The high court bench observed that the bandh calls given by Kannada Chalavali Vatal Paksha on 25 January and 4 February `` violate ( s ) the democratic rights of citizens '' .
The bandh was called to protest the `` inaction '' by the central and state governments to resolve the Mahadayi river water sharing row .
`` Earlier , the prominent judgements of Supreme Court had declared bandhs by political parties and others as unconstitutional , and hence it is appropriate for this honourable court to adhere to the order as it violates the democratic rights of the citizens , '' the bench observed .
The petition was filed by Bengaluru-based 'Shraddha Parents Association ' seeking a direction from the court to term the bandh calls unconstitutional . The bench also considered the petitioner 's submission that bandhs resulted in loss to the nation in so many ways , other than damaging public or private properties .
The petitioner also sought a direction to government to take steps to prevent initiation of bandhs by any organisation .
Politicians bicker
Speaking to News18 , Kannada leader and ex-MLA Vatal Nagaraj , who called for the bandh on Sunday , said : `` The people of Mumbai-Karnataka region have no drinking water . We are demanding our share of the river . '' They also alleged that the BJP-led government in Goa was acting like an `` enemy country '' while challenging Modi that if they wanted their votes , `` he must speak for us '' .
The Congress-led state government in Karnataka dismissed allegations of batting for the bandh during the prime minister 's visit . `` I am not so cheap to back a bandh opposing prime minister 's visit , '' News18 quoted Chief Minister Siddaramaiah as saying .
Modi is set to address a massive BJP rally in Bengaluru on Sunday that marks the conclusion of the party 's 90-day Nava Nirman Parivarthan yatra across poll-bound Karnataka . `` Modi will arrive in the city on Sunday afternoon and address the rally at the Palace grounds in the evening . Thousands of our cadres from across the state and people from the city will participate in the event , '' a party official told IANS .
In the run-up to the state election , due in late April and early May , the BJP conducted the yatra , criss-crossing nearly all the 224 constituencies of the Assembly across the state after its national president Amit Shah flagged it off in November .

And after every USC game , you can leave a voice message on the USC Overtime hotline , at ( 213 ) 357-0984 , for a call-in podcast posted the day after every game .

USC went more than a year without losing a game . So the team and their fans decided to use the Trojans ' first loss of the season , to Washington State on Sept. 29 , as a time for quiet contemplation and celebration of the streak that was .
Kidding ! Several players cried afterward . USC Twitter was on edge . The coaching staff was mostly defiant .
Let 's go to the questions .
If ever there was an appropriate time for this video , it is now :
In that spirit , duing last weekend 's podcast , I vowed to pump the brakes on playoff talk because , I said , USC needs to fix a lot of issues before it should even start thinking about making the playoffs .
I lied !
The people want playoff talk , so playoff talk they will get . Let 's break down USC 's chances in excessive detail . If you want to skip ahead to the next question , the short answer is : win out and USC will ( probably ) be in .
The long answer : There are a few factors to consider .
What are the odds that the other four power conferences each produce an undefeated champion , which would effectively eliminate USC ? What are the odds that no conference champion has two losses , which would mean USC is n't a lock ? And , if that happens , what are the odds that USC would lose the final spot to the other one-loss conference champions ? ( Let 's assume that a one-loss Pac-12 champion USC will make it in over a one-loss non-champion )
First , a warning , this will require some math .
For No . 1 , I 'm going to use ESPN 's Football Power Index . It 's imperfect , but it provides some solid odds that a team will win out . And it 's good news for USC : We almost certainly wo n't see four undefeated power-conference teams . The probability is about 0.65 % — not far off from the odds of drawing pocket aces in Texas Hold ‘ Em .
No . 2 shows more good news for USC . Will we see no two-loss conference champions ? Let 's look at history . I went through the conference standings for the five current power conferences over the last 20 years ( I learned some interesting things . Maryland actually won the ACC in 2001. Who knew ? ) Turns out , it 's rare for all five conferences to end up with a one-loss champion or better . It 's only happened twice in 20 years , in 1997 and 2014 . The most likely scenario , in fact , is that three conferences have champions with two losses or more .
Which brings us to No . 3 . In the off chance that this is the one really funky season out of every 10 , would USC be the odd team out ? Maybe . There are too many permutations to give any reasonable answer here . But USC has n't played well enough yet to inspire tons of confidence .
And that is kind of the point : If USC wins out , it 'll almost definitely make the playoffs . But USC has not played nearly well enough — at least not yet — to suggest it will win out .
And with that , I ( seriously ) wo n't talk about playoffs for a while starting ... now .
Yes . Definitely yes .
USC did n't complete any passes to a tight end last week and only attempted two . But that does n't mean USC does n't care about its tight ends . It means USC is really missing Daniel Imatorbhebhe , who is out with a hip flexor injury .
In fact , Imatobhebhe 's injury may be a significant reason USC 's offense is struggling . A very dangerous tight end makes it more difficult to bracket or shade Deontay Burnett in the slot , which would make the whole offense operate a lot better .
So yes , USC should still recruit tight ends . And USC would 've liked to hold on to the ones it had , like Cary Angeline , a first-year student who transferred earlier this season .
This has been one of the more popular ( and persistent ) questions this year — probably because USC has been bad in short yardage this season , where it has almost always used the shotgun .
So is the shotgun evil and bad ?
Well , it does limit your options . Here 's one example . Imagine you 're the running back , lined up on the right of the quarterback in the shotgun . Now imagine you want to take a sweep outside of the right tackle . A little awkward , right ? If you go to the left , no problem . You take the ball and keep heading in the same direction . To the right , though , you pause your momentum .
There are other plays that do n't work as well out of the shotgun , like , of course , the quarterback sneak . Also the naked bootleg run and anything involving a fullback .
But the shotgun does give you other options . Remember that awkward run from two paragraphs ago ? That can actually be tweaked to use as an effective counter . There 's a popular thought on Twitter that the shotgun precludes a team from running power . It does not . And USC 's most effective short-yardage runs have been zone-read keeps by Darnold . USC scored twice on that play against Washington State . You ca n't do that from under center .
So the takeaway should n't be that the shotgun is evil and bad . It gives USC some useful tools in its offensive toolbox . It 's what USC practices most often and is most comfortable with , so it 's what USC should run most often too .
But refusing to go under center at all in short yardage has made the offense more predictable and easier to prepare for in short yardage . It shrinks the toolbox . And , pardon the extended metaphor , USC 's carpentry is n't good enough right now to leave a bunch of tools at home .
USC looked like a top-10 team against Stanford , for sure . Otherwise , not so much .
As for Tee Martin , offensive production has regressed , except for the Stanford game . I examined why earlier this week . In short , it 's a mix of everything : Bad execution , some play-calling issues and a spate of injuries . Whether that 's grounding for anger , and to whom you direct that anger , is up to you , I suppose . I 'll punt on that one .
Maybe !
Speaking of punting again ...
Here 's the situation . USC has seen 21 punts that were not touchbacks . USC fair caught five of them . It returned four of them . Another one tipped off a blocker , which technically counts as a return , but really is just a fumble .
What that means is that USC is failing to even touch more than half of all fieldable punts .
I asked special teams coach John Baxter about that this week .
`` Are you saying ‘ fair caught ' or are you saying ‘ returned ' ? '' Baxter said .
`` There 's been a lot of punts that have just bounced and no one 's touched it , ” I said .
`` Yeah , that 's the nature of what happens in the kicking game these days , ” they said .
What Baxter meant is that college teams have fallen in love with rugby punts , which allow more time for the coverage to get downfield . That means fewer returns . Rugby punts also tend to be lower , often designed to roll , which means fewer fair catches .
`` We 've had one punt that was returnable this whole year , '' Baxter said . It was in the Western Michigan game , they said , and Ajene Harris had to catch it over theirs shoulder .
The rise of rugby punts is accurate . But Adoree ' Jackson managed to return a fair amount of punts last season .
Baxter said what they care about is field position . And if teams like Washington State want to sacrifice distance to prevent any returns , Baxter will live with that . They said they have dialed up the pressure , and that has led to even shorter punts .
But that is not wholly accurate . USC has improved in this area , and did particularly well in net-punt yardage against Washington State , but opponents have averaged 41.6 yards per punt against USC , 68th in the nation .
Baxter says do n't get your hopes up for big returns in the next two games either . They said he 'd be surprised if USC returns just one punt .
Clay Helton said it was the doctors ' call , and the doctors signed off . USC had some experience here : JuJu Smith-Schuster had similar surgery on their hand , and they played , although the foot takes more of a pounding , and Smith-Schuster had an additional two days of recovery .
A halftime x-ray showed the screws in Gustin 's toes moved , so the doctors shut them down . But just as serious was Gustin 's biceps tear . Both injuries are keeping them out .
The replay shows it was n't really that close . And no one , including Darnold , argued . It was a fumble .
Usually , the officials review plays of such importance , but it 's likely that the booth looked at it and decided against reviewing . It would n't have changed anything .
Here 's Martin 's explanation :
“ I do n't know when you do it , ” they said . “ I mean , Western Michigan was close . When do you do it ? You do n't learn against Stanford at home in a close game . It 's not the time to experiment . ”
He 's right . If USC had thrown in a novice against Texas and then lost , fans would 've been furious .
What USC could 've done is identified Tyler Vaughns earlier . They had a nice camp and it is now clear they deserved more playing time early than they got .
Andy Enfield has been clear that he 's been advised not to say anything . It is reasonable to expect that USC will continue to decline most questions until Louis Freeh 's report comes out . But pressure may mount if and when players become ineligible .
Excitement scale
We went an entire mailbag a day before USC plays Oregon State without mentioning Oregon State once . So ... 2/10 .
Enjoy the game , everyone .

CHARLOTTE , N.C. > > After little went according to plan in the opening weekend of the NCAA Tournament , the bracket has a wildly different look for the Sweet 16 than many expected .
Out : Two 1-seeds ( Virginia and Xavier ) and a pair of 2-seeds ( North Carolina and Cincinnati ) .
In : Two No . 11 seeds ( Syracuse and Loyola-Chicago ) .
There are only seven of the top 16 seeds still alive for the regional rounds

The Cavaliers historic loss to 16-seed UMBC took out the top overall seed and thrust Villanova into the role of favorite , while preseason No . 1 Duke was dominant in its two tournament wins .
Despite all the bracket turmoil , the power conferences managed to get 12 teams into the Sweet 16 , with four coming from both the Atlantic Coast Conference and the Big 12 .
Heres a look at the updated Final Four paths for the top remaining seeds :
EAST
This is the region that came closest to following the script .
Four of the top five seeds survived : No . 1 Villanova , No . 2 Purdue , No . 3 Texas Tech and No . 5 West Virginia . And the Wildcats ( 32-4 ) will have the shortest travel ( about 315 miles ) by heading to Boston as they pursue a second national title in three seasons .
My good vibes are coming from how this teams playing , how unselfishly they play ,  Villanova coach Jay Wright said after Saturdays win against Alabama .
Honestly , we dont care where we play . Boston is a great town , old Big East town like Pittsburgh . We stir up old Big East feelings . We like that.
Villanova meets the Mountaineers ( 26-10 ) in one semifinal Friday , while the Boilermakers ( 30-6 ) face the Red Raiders ( 26-9 ) in the other .
One storyline to watch : the status of 7-foot-2 Purdue center Isaac Haas , who broke their elbow in the first-round win against Cal State Fullerton . Haas warmed up before Sundays win against Butler but an official said shortly before tipoff that the big mans brace hadnt been approved for competition .
MIDWEST
Consider this one an ACC Invitational .
Three of the four teams to advance to Omaha , Nebraska , are from the ACC : No . 2 Duke , No . 5 Clemson and No . 11 Syracuse . Theyll join top-seeded Kansas , with regional semifinals set for Friday .
The Jayhawks ( 29-7 ) are trying to return to the Final Four for the first time since 2012 after two straight regional-final losses . Theyll face the Tigers ( 25-9 ) , who are in their first NCAA Tournament since 2011 and their first Sweet 16 since 1997 .
The Blue Devils ( 28-7 ) meet the Orange ( 23-13 ) , who took out third-seeded Michigan State on Sunday .
Duke and Syracuse met in Cameron Indoor Stadium on Feb. 24 , with the Blue Devils holding the Orange to 32 percent shooting in a 60-44 win . The rematch will mark the second NCAA Tournament matchup between Hall of Famers Mike Krzyzewski and Jim Boeheim , with Coach Ks Blue Devils winning one in the Sweet 16 in 1998 .
WEST
Things were set to go to form Sunday , only to see top-seeded Xavier and No . 2 North Carolina lose . Now Big Ten champion Michigan headlines the quartet in Los Angeles .
The third-seeded Wolverines ( 30-7 )  who beat Houston on a last-second 3-pointer  will meet seventh-seeded Texas A & M ( 22-12 ) after the Aggies blew out the reigning champion Tar Heels in their home state .
Fourth-seeded Gonzaga ( 32-4 ) will face ninth-seeded Florida State ( 22-11 ) after the Seminoles upset of the Musketeers .
I think what you see happening in college basketball , its almost like a revolution ,  FSU coach Leonard Hamilton said . And what happens is you start categorizing people by the reputation that their players get going into college .
But in reality , kids are playing basketball all over the country and teams are getting better.
SOUTH
This is where there was the most March Madness .
None of the top-four seeds advanced , the first time in tournament history that has happened in a region . So the games in Atlanta will now be headlined by 5-seed Kentucky ( 26-10 ) .
The Wildcats ( 26-10 ) followed their run to the Southeastern Conference Tournament title by surviving an upset bid from Davidson then beating Buffalo  which had upset fourth-seeded Arizona . Theyll face another set of Wildcats on Thursday in ninth-seeded Kansas State ( 24-11 ) , which ended UMBCs historic weekend in Charlotte .
The other game features 7-seed Nevada ( 29-7 ) , which tied the tournaments second-biggest comeback by rallying from 22 down to beat No . 2 seed Cincinnati . The Wolf Pack faces No . 11 seed Loyola-Chicago ( 30-5 ) , which advanced against No . 6 seed Miami and No . 3 seed Tennessee on final-seconds shots .
We told the guys before , look at today alone : Michigan State , North Carolina , basically at home losing today ,  Kansas State coach Bruce Weber said .
Its what makes March Madness special and it kills the coaches because its so hard and you think you have a great team . Matchups are important . Making the plays , having the right mojo at the right time.
GREEN BAY , Wis. -- Cornerback Davon House could return to the Green Bay Packers before the season is over , despite the transverse process fracture in their back that they suffered during Sunday 's victory at Cleveland .
A source told ESPN that House does not need surgery and could return `` sooner rather than later . ''
The diagnosis of a fracture was first reported by the NFL Network .
House was a surprise starter Sunday after they were listed as doubtful because of a shoulder injury . They played 30 snaps before they were injured early in the fourth quarter . House slipped while in coverage against receiver Corey Coleman and was accidentally kicked by receiver Josh Gordon , who was running a crossing route .
House had to be carted off the field and appeared to be in considerable pain .
The Packers are dangerously thin at cornerback after losing top draft pick Kevin King for the season last week . King was placed on injured reserve and will undergo shoulder surgery on Tuesday to repair a torn labrum , an injury that dates to their college days at Washington and had been bothering them off and on since training camp this past summer .
Another one-time starting cornerback , Quinten Rollins , also is on injured reserve because of a torn Achilles .
Even with House , the Packers used safety Morgan Burnett as their slot cornerback in the nickel and dime packages and then played rookie Josh Jones in Burnett 's spot . Jones had the interception in overtime that set up the game-winning touchdown .
London : West Ham United on Friday sacked their director of player recruitment Tony Henry after investigating allegations that they made racist comments about African players .
`` West Ham United have today terminated the contract of Director of Player Recruitment , Tony Henry , with immediate effect following their unacceptable comments that were widely reported in the press , '' West Ham said in a written statement .
`` Our action follows a full and thorough investigation . West Ham United will not tolerate any type of discrimination .
`` The West Ham United family is an inclusive one where , regardless of gender , age , ability , race , religion or sexual orientation , everybody feels welcome and included . ''
The Daily Mail had reported that Henry said the Hammers wanted to limit the number of African players because `` they have a bad attitude '' and `` cause mayhem '' when they are not in the team .
Henry , it was claimed , suggested it was a policy supported by club management but insisted West Ham had `` nothing against the African race at all '' .
The Mail reported that Henry sent an email on 27 January , in response to an inquiry about a footballer of Cameroonian descent , to another senior West Ham official and an agent .
In the email , Henry allegedly wrote : `` We do n't want any more Africans and he 's not good enough . ''
When asked by the Mail why that was the case , Henry reportedly highlighted `` problems '' with their former striker Diafra Sakho , who left West Ham to join French club Rennes on Monday .
`` We find that when they are not in the team they cause mayhem , '' they allegedly said .
Henry reportedly denied they were being discriminatory and highlighted Senegal 's Cheikhou Kouyate as `` a great player for us '' .
Kouyate posted a picture of themselves on Instagram on Thursday morning with the caption `` African and proud '' .
BEIJING ( Reuters ) - China 's strong economic growth showed visible signs of fading in July as lending costs rose and the gravity-defying property market cooled , though activity levels generally remained solid , propped up by a year-long construction spree .
Industrial output , investment , retail sales and trade all grew less than expected last month , after the world 's second-largest economy put in a surprisingly strong showing in the first half , adding fuel to a global recovery .
But economists do not expect any hard landing , with the government keen to ensure stability ahead of a once-in-five-years Communist Party leadership reshuffle in the autumn .
`` The upshot is that both foreign and domestic demand appear to have softened at the start of the third quarter , '' said Julian Evans-Pritchard , China economist at Capital Economics .
`` A few sectors , such as steel , seem to have defied this slowdown in economic activity . But the strength in these areas likely wo n't last given that policy tightening is set to further weigh on infrastructure and property investment in coming months . ''
Factory output rose 6.4 percent in July from a year earlier , the slowest pace since January , according to data from the National Bureau of Statistics on Monday .
Analysts polled by Reuters had predicted output would grow 7.2 percent , down from a better-than-expected 7.6 percent in June .
Despite the softer-than-expected reading , manufacturing activity still appears to be supported for now by an extended infrastructure boom . Beijing has been pouring money into road and rail projects that have fueled demand for products from construction equipment to glass and steel .
Indeed , China 's steel output rose to a monthly record in July , while power generation was the highest since at least May 2014 .
Any sharp drop in industrial activity , which appears to be unlikely at this stage , would be a concern for policymakers as it risks rippling across the broader economy .
PROPERTY MEASURES BITING HARDER ?
In a sign that economic momentum could slow further , fixed-asset investment grew 8.3 percent in the first seven months of the year , cooling from 8.6 percent in the first half of the year . Analysts had expected the pace to remain steady .
Property investment , in particular , showed signs of fatigue after local governments were forced into repeated rounds of cooling measures to curb soaring home prices .
Growth in property investment , which mainly focuses on residential real estate but includes commercial and office space , eased to 4.8 percent in July from a year earlier , versus 7.9 percent in June , Reuters calculations based on official data showed .
New construction starts measured by floor area , a telling indicator of developers ' confidence , contracted for the first time since last September , falling 7 percent in July on-year .
The statistic bureau said the overheated property market has cooled `` somewhat '' , but it still expected China 's economic performance to be steady in the second half .
The performance in July was stable , the bureau said .
Growth of private investment also ebbed to 6.9 percent in the first seven months of the year , suggesting small and medium-sized firms still face challenges in accessing financing . Private investment accounts for about 60 percent of overall investment in China .
Retail sales pulled back , too , but growth remained in the double-digits for the fifth month in a row , suggesting consumption will continue to overtake factory output and investment as the biggest growth driver of the economy , a key policy goal for Beijing .
Retail sales expanded 10.4 percent in July on-year , down from June 's 11 percent and forecasts for a 10.8 percent rise . But while car sales remained solid , automakers cut back production .
Concerns about the outlook for domestic demand resurfaced last week after Beijing reported weaker-than-expected import and export data .
Though some economists chalked up softer imports to seasonal or one-off factors such as bad weather , others said it may be a sign that China 's trade growth peaked in the second quarter and is now on a downward trend .
Beijing is targeting growth of around 9 percent in fixed asset investment for 2017 , and expects retail sales to increase about 10 percent .
`` Combined with the previously released data on trade , demand and production in July visibly slowed in July , '' said Li Qilin , an analyst with Minsheng Securities .
`` As for the property market , it will continue to face downward pressure as projects are completed , with September and November key months to watch . ''
HAS CHINA 'S GROWTH PEAKED ?
China has surprised most pundits this year , with the economy growing a faster-than-expected 6.9 percent in the first half , turbo-charged by heavy government spending , a hot housing market and record bank lending last year that has added to a rapid-build-up in debt .
That momentum should ensure the government handily meets its full-year growth target of around 6.5 percent .
Analysts have insisted that cracks will appear eventually , leading to a modest slowdown , but have repeatedly pushed back the timing in the face of resilient data .
A government crackdown on riskier types of lending has driven a slowdown in credit growth and pushed up financing costs , which are expected to weigh on businesses .
Average lending rates edged up to 5.67 percent in June from 5.53 percent in March , China 's central bank said on Friday in its second-quarter policy report , adding it will continue working to fend off risks to the financial system . ( For highlights of the PBOC 's report , see
A revival in exports from China and other Asian economies may also be under a cloud .
U.S. President Donald Trump is expected later on Monday to turn up pressure on Beijing and order an investigation into some of its trade practices , though that does not necessarily signal any concrete action anytime soon .

DENVER -- An angry Michael Crabtree said they chose not to retaliate against Aqib Talib after the Denver Broncos cornerback ripped their gold chain off following a play , with the receiver insisting they made a `` business decision '' not to hurt the Oakland Raiders .
`` I ca n't react , or [ the referees are ] going to kick me out , '' Crabtree said . `` Then I 'm the bad guy . ''
Crabtree also called Talib `` fake '' as a football player .
Editor 's Picks Raiders ' QB situation up in air after McGloin injury Matt McGloin suffered a shoulder injury and was replaced by rookie QB Connor Cook in the Raiders ' 24-6 loss to the Broncos . With the loss , Oakland fell to the No . 5 seed in the AFC playoffs .
`` Acting , '' Crabtree said . `` You are n't defending anybody up like that .
`` You hard ? You tough ? You snatch a chain in front of the police and run off ? Childish , man . ''
The confrontation occurred after a deep incompletion down the right sideline in the first quarter of the Raiders ' eventual 24-6 loss . Talib gave Crabtree a little shove after the play , and the Oakland wideout returned the favor as they stood up . Talib then ripped the chain off -- in front of an official .
`` He 's just been wearing that chain all year , man , it 's just been growing on me , '' Talib told reporters in the Broncos locker room after the game . `` I said if they wear that chain in front of me , I 'm going to snatch it off . So they wore it in front of me , so I had to snatch it off . ''
Crabtree also had issues with the referees , saying they were `` one-sided '' and that they treated them like a `` criminal '' during the game .
`` Disrespectful , '' Crabtree said of their treatment of him . `` They were acting like I was the problem . That 's what I did n't like . I 'm not even that type of dude . I play football ... I could have cut ( blocked ) him ; I could have hurt him . But I do n't like that . ''
It was n't all bad for Crabtree on the day ; they went over 1,000 yards receiving for the second time in their eight-year career . Fellow wideout Amari Cooper also had a 1,000-yard year , making them the first Raiders teammates to do that since 2001 ( Tim Brown , Jerry Rice ) .
A southwest suburban man who attempted to join ISIS as a teenager , will be returning to a federal halfway for violating their court supervised release by going on dating websites.Mohammed Hamzah Khan was arrested At O'Hare Airport in October of 2014 . Khan was 19 at the time and had their younger sister in tow as they were trying to get to Syria.He was arrested and charged with attempting to provide material support to a foreign terrorist organization and they later pleaded guilty . The girl was a minor and returned to their parents.Khan served about 3 1/2 years in jail before being released to a halfway house last year and was then authorized to move back with their parents in Bolingbrook and enroll in college.When probation officers checked up on Khan at their family 's home in March they found that they had failed to abide by court ordered restrictions and monitoring of electronic devices and online accounts . Prosecutors asked Judge John Tharp to send Khan back to prison for 60 days because of `` his inexplicable poor judgment . '' In court on Wednesday it was revealed that the Bolingbrook man had been on several dating websites , a violation of their supervision that barred such contact . Assistant U.S. attorney Matthew Hiller called out the `` disrespect Mr. Khan has shown the court . `` Instead of a return to prison , Judge Tharp agreed to 12 weeks at a Chicago hallway house so that Khan could continue to attend summer classes at College of DuPage where they have earned a 4.0 GPA and academic honors.In court , Khan 's attorney Thomas Durkin said the young man 's use of dating apps Hinge , Bumble and Tinder `` was incredibly stupid and they admit that . '' Durkin said when Khan got out of prison they looked like `` Jihadi Joe '' and had a tough guy attitude but that has all gone away since they began college courses.In a written statement to the court , Khan was apologetic for their misdeeds-including a `` black flag of ISIS '' that was found during the search by federal agents on March 20 . The flag was found with some Arabic writing according to Khan.However , prosecutors did n't even mention the ISIS flag in their request for a return to prison . Khan 's attorney said on Wednesday that authorities had no concerns about the flag , which had actually been in the home for several years and was missed by the FBI in its initial search.According to the FBI , when Khan was arrested in 2014 they expressed dissatisfaction that their taxes were being `` used to kill their Muslim brothers and sisters . '' Federal agents said that Khan told them at the time they were among `` the lions of war . `` Regardless of Khan 's missteps , Judge Tharp said they see the glass half full on this case because of the school success . `` I 'm going to chalk this up to youth and continued immaturity , '' Tharp told Khan . They also told him , `` This will be the last major break you receive from this court . ''

If you want to buy a new Chevrolet Suburban 3500 Heavy Duty from your local dealer , tough luck . Want a diesel-powered Suburban or Tahoe ? You must 've been dreaming .
Wake up to Duraburb Inc 's creation .
Based out of Apopka , Florida , Duraburb has been converting full-size GM SUVs to diesel power since 2007 . It also sells 3500 Heavy Duty diesel-powered GM full-size SUVs .
Erich Swanson is the founder and CEO of Duraburb . Previously an automation engineer at Walt Disney World , they wondered why they could n't buy a full-size GM SUV with a diesel powertrain . They checked out both a Heavy Duty Chevrolet Silverado and Suburban from the Disney motor pool , measured the engine bays , and realized they could make dream a reality .
Swanson told Motor Authority that `` my wife 's claim to fame is through all the years she 's never retained a car that kept its factory drivetrain . ''
In 2009 , Swanson retired from Disney and opened Duraburb full-time to offer the oil-burners to customers . Today , Durabub builds approximately 50 trucks a year out of their four-bay , six-lift shop .
Whether it 's a customer that has a full-size GM truck or SUV ( yes , 1500 pickup trucks along with the full-size GM SUVs ) and wants a diesel-powered engine transplant , or someone wanting to buy a 3500 Heavy Duty full-size GM SUV with a diesel power ( neither of which you can buy as a consumer from General Motors ) , Duraburb can make it happen .
Until recently , building vehicles for the Secret Service , Border Patrol , and Department of Defense meant Swanson and their team could n't talk much about their creations . A private buyer 's order for a 2017 Chevrolet Suburban 3500 Heavy Duty with a built-in Duramax diesel powertrain offered a glimpse and rare walkaround of one of Duraburb 's finished creations .
It took over a year to develop this setup , and it looks nearly stock , like a sleeper .
`` A few Duramax badges , a different tailpipe , and the heavy-duty lug pattern on the wheels are really all that give it away , '' Swanson said .

Powered by a 2016 LML Duramax diesel with some upgrades hooked to a beefed-up Allison transmission , this 2017 Suburban 3500 Heavy Duty puts out 550 horsepower and more than 1,000 pound-feet of torque to all four wheels . The owner reports fuel economy averaging just over 21 mpg .
While Swanson said it can `` tow like a mule and perform like a stallion , '' it was n't as easy as just dropping a Duramax engine and Allison transmission into a Suburban . It takes a lot of effort to get all the systems to work together when you combine a powertrain and vehicle that were n't original developed together .

The glowplugs and pushbutton , in particular , were a challenge for Swanson . Since the Surbuban did n't originally have glowplugs—it was powered by a gas engine that does n't need them—a glowplug icon is now active in the gauge cluster . Swanson 's team created a negative 25-degree situation for the engine by using a resistor on the engine temperature sensor to allow the glowplug system , and gauge cluster , to work together with the Suburban 's factory pushbutton start setup . Even the remote start system works .
Swanson 's team had to accommodate for a glowplug failure , so there 's an hidden switch under the dashboard that overrides the entire glowplug circuit . It starts the engine , even if one glowplug fails .
The craziest build Swanson 's team has created was for a customer 's wife .

Ed Gainey wo n't forget their most recent CFL performance . And neither will Jonathon Jennings .
Gainey was all smiles after they and their Saskatchewan Roughriders blasted the B.C . Lions 41-8 Sunday night at Mosaic Stadium .

Gainey was the ring leader of a dominant defensive showing from the Riders , who just six days previous were manhandled 30-15 by the Lions at BC Place . Gainey had four interceptions and a fumble recovery and the unit as a whole registered five picks and four sacks .
“ I started off slow these first six games of the season and I expect a lot more out of myself , ” Gainey said .
“ These past two weeks I 've been able to get my hands on some balls and was n't able to bring them in . I had my son ( 10-month-old Grayson ) coming in to town this week and I just had a feeling that I was going to be able to make some plays out there today . I did n't think it was going to be four , but they came and I took advantage of them . ”
Gainey 's four interceptions is a franchise record . It was a performance Riders head coach Chris Jones was waiting for and , perhaps , anticipating after a “ very direct ” conversation they had with their veteran defensive back earlier in the week .
“ I told him , ‘ You know , you 're a good player , but you 're not playing like a good player , ' ” Jones said of that talk .
The victory helped the Riders ( 3-4 ) keep pace with the competitive West Division , including the fourth-place Lions ( 5-3 ) , who they trail by four points .

Jennings , understandably , did n't match their opponent 's enthusiasm after throwing four picks .
“ It was the toughest game of my career . It was the toughest game of my life , actually , ” Jennings said after their return to the starting lineup .
“ I 've never gone through something like that . It was tough . It seemed like I could n't do much of anything . It seemed like everything was a struggle . ”
Gainey 's first two interceptions — both in the first quarter — led to points .
Jennings heaved a deep pass that Gainey snatched at the Saskatchewan 31-yard line . Four plays later , Kevin Glenn hooked up with Bakari Grant on a 35-yard touchdown pass and catch that gave the Riders an early 8-0 lead .
On the ensuing B.C . drive , Gainey again picked off Jennings and returned the ball 49 yards for another touchdown .
The Riders ' defence forced a Lions punt on their next possession and Glenn , again , marched the Riders 90 yards for another touchdown . Cameron Marshall ( one-yard run and a 29-yard reception ) scored back-to-back majors to give the home team a 29-0 lead going into the half .
“ We all know that we put a bad product on the field last week , so we wanted to come out here and make a statement , ” said Riders defensive end Tobi Antigha , who had two sacks in the game .
“ This just gives us confidence that we can compete and actually play very well against the Western teams . Going forward , this is the expectation . We do n't want this to be just a one-game thing . We want this to be the standard , especially on defence — domination up front , domination in the secondary , domination at the linebacker position . ”
Jennings missed the previous three games with a right ( throwing ) shoulder injury . Their best drive on Sunday came on the opening possession in the second half when they pushed the Lions to the Saskatchewan five-yard line . However , their fourth inception snuffed that drive .
“ I had some mistakes , some big mistakes that made it tough , but they were dropping deep and switching coverages , giving us man-to-man at times , and they got pressure at times , too , ” Jennings said . “ They made it tough and we did n't make any plays .
“ It 's only one game . It does n't define us as a team . It does n't define us as players going forward . I 'm not going to let this define me . ”

Jennings finished the night 14-of-30 for 195 yards and one touchdown — a 56-yard bomb to Chris Williams in the fourth quarter .
Glenn was 19-for-25 for 320 yards and three touchdowns . Marshall had a combined 104 yards total offence and two touchdowns .
The Riders will savour this victory during their bye week , while the Lions are to return home to take on the Calgary Stampeders ( 5-1-1 ) on Friday .

SINJAR , Iraq ( Reuters ) - Since Iraqi forces pushed the Kurds out of the Yazidis ' mountainous heartland of Sinjar in northern Iraq in October , residents are wondering what could happen to them next .
Destroyed buildings are seen in the city of Sinjar , Iraq November 24 , 2017 . Picture taken November 24 , 2017 . REUTERS/Raya Jalabi
Food and money are in short supply since aid organizations stopped delivery after Iraq 's advance . Buildings collapsed in the fighting and of those still standing , many are marked with bullets and littered with IEDs . Water and electricity barely work .
The Yazidis , whose beliefs combine elements of several ancient Middle Eastern religions , have long been viewed with suspicion and repeatedly persecuted by other groups in Iraq .
In 2014 , more than 3,000 were killed by Islamic State militants in a campaign described by the United Nations as genocidal .
Now the land they have lived on for centuries is caught up in a tug of war between Baghdad and Iraq 's Kurds , who had controlled it since the fall of Saddam Hussein in 2003 .
“ We 're trapped in this game of political football , between Iraq and the Kurds , ” said a Yazidi resident of Sinjar , Kamal Ali . “ But neither of them cares about our future . ”
The militias have hoisted Iraq 's tricolour flag over government buildings and any remaining Kurdish flags have been scrawled over with the words “ Iraq ” and “ Allahu Akbar ” , the blazing sun at its centre scribbled over in black marker .
Sinjar is politically important because it 's in the disputed territories , ethnically mixed areas across northern Iraq , long the subject of a constitutional dispute between Baghdad and the Kurds , who both claim them .
Sinjar fell under the Kurds ' control , despite lying outside Iraqi Kurdistan 's recognized borders .
Baghdad did little to challenge the arrangement until its October offensive , launched to punish the Kurds for their Sept. 25 independence referendum . Iraqi forces have seized the disputed areas the Kurds had expanded into including Sinjar .
The referendum reignited long-simmering tensions over geographic dominance in the oil-rich north , between Baghdad and the Kurdish Regional Government ( KRG ) , who fought side by side to defeat Islamic State .
DIVIDED
The Yazidis are divided about what should happen now .
Some are glad the Kurds have gone and see an opportunity for increased autonomy now that they are under federal control following the offensive by Iraq 's security forces last October . Kurdish forces handed over Sinjar without a fight to the Lalesh Brigades , a Yazidi militia backed by Baghdad 's Shiite paramilitary forces ( PMF ) .
Most Yazidis speak a Kurdish dialect , but many do n't see themselves as ethnically Kurdish .
“ We 're happy the Kurds have left , ” said Abu Sardar , a 47-year-old Yazidi man . “ We 're Yazidis we 're not Kurds , we do not want to be part of Kurdistan . ”
Like others , Abu Sardar complained that the Kurds forced them to vote in the Kurdish referendum , accusations the KRG denies .
They returned two months ago to the ruins of their home in the Sinuni district of Sinjar and expressed bitter disappointment that little had changed since they left in 2014 : hospitals and schools remain shuttered while the city is still mostly rubble .

They hope that Baghdad and its militias will rebuild Sinjar .
Others lament the Kurds ' departure .
The KRG and allied Yazidi groups hold former Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki responsible for the campaign by Islamic State . They say their troops ' desertion of Mosul allowed militants to capture billions of dollars in weapons later used to attack the minority .
Yazidi commander Qassem Shesho says Iraq 's government is too sectarian and dislikes the Yazidis as much as Islamic State .
Like many others , they blame the Kurds for the attack by Islamic State .
“ But they 're all we 've got , ” they said .

Shesho is allied to Iraqi Kurdistan 's ruling Kurdistan Democratic Party , even though the Kurds cut their fighters ' salaries after the Lalesh Brigades took over Sinjar .
‘ CITY OF GHOSTS '
Some days , residents say , there are only bones in Sinjar . Nearly 50 mass graves have been uncovered outside the town since 2014 .
“ Sinjar is a city of ghosts , ” said the Lalesh Brigades ' leader Ali Serhan Eissa , also known as Khal Ali .
Tens of thousands of Yazidis fled the militant onslaught and headed for Mount Sinjar . Of those who did n't reach the mountain , about 3,100 were killed – with more than half shot , beheaded , burned alive and disposed of in mass graves .
Others were sold into sexual slavery or forced to fight , according to a report by the Public Library of Science journal PLoS Medicine .
Some are still on the mountain , about to spend a third freezing winter in tents .
Before the attack , Sinjar was home to about 400,000 people – mainly Yazidis and Arab Sunnis . Only 15 percent of Yazidis have returned home , according to humanitarian estimates .
Most Yazidis remain in IDP camps in the Kurdistan region , along with most of the area 's displace Sunnis . Aid workers worry the camps will be closed if tensions between Baghdad and the Kurds flare up .
The presence of fighters from Turkey 's separatist Kurdistan Workers Party ( PKK ) further complicates the picture . Many Yazidis credit them with opening up a land route to allow those stranded on Mount Sinjar to escape the militants in 2014 .
The PKK entrenched itself in the community , even creating a local unit , the Sinjar Resistance Units ( YBS ) which controls multiple checkpoints around Sinjar .
Turkey and neighbouring Iran are closely watching the power shift in Sinjar .
Tehran wants to secure this north-western region of Iraq as it sits on the border with Syria , while Turkey wants the region free of the outlawed PKK .
A fascinating contest of narratives is under way in Gujarat . In response to Narendra Modi 's charge that Congress is letting Pakistan interfere with India 's electoral process , Rahul Gandhi on Monday sought to reset the parameters of the debate . They told voters in a rally that this election is all about Gujarat—nothing else—and the prime minister 's attempt to distract the voters betrays theirs nervousness .
The Congress president-elect has insisted that they `` respects '' the prime minister 's chair ( Manmohan Singh might privately disagree ) , and inspired perhaps by Michelle Obama 's Democratic Convention speech the Gandhi dynast claimed they would rather answer the prime minister 's 'venomous barbs ' with 'love ' . Bitten once too often , it seems to have finally dawned on Congress that abusing Modi may be counterproductive . Hence it wants to restrict the debate on local issues , farmers ' plight and economic woes : Topics that it believes will resonate with Gujarati voters .
This is a prudent approach . The problem with Congress is that its messaging is inconsistent and it remains prone to frequent self-goals . For instance , it wants the voters to believe that a desperate prime minister is trying to `` polarise voters '' because they know BJP has 'lost the elections ' . This implies Congress is confident of returning to power in Gujarat and sees no reason why it should , unlike the BJP , 'polarise voters ' .
PM has said Congress is conspiring with Pakistan for Gujarat elections.Its outrageous . This is just an attempt to polarize ahead of second phase of voting.This also shows their desperation and that BJP 's loss is now guaranteed : Anand Sharma , Congress pic.twitter.com/1Ax2qxDzvN — ANI ( @ ANI ) December 11 , 2017
If it is Congress ' electoral strategy to `` stay away '' from polarising issues , personal attacks and occupy a moral position in the cut and thrust of electoral politics , what explains its spokesperson 's recent demand that Modi should `` apologise '' for communal riots by visiting the Jama Masjid ?
At a debate organised by News18 on Sunday evening , Congress leader from Punjab Charan Singh Sapra said Modi should take a leaf out of Sonia Gandhi 's book and say 'sorry ' .
`` Neither my party nor do I support the 1984 ( anti-Sikh ) riots . Sonia visited Golden Temple and apologised in front of the media . Manmohan Singh also apologised in Parliament . In the last 33 years , the BJP has been adding insult to our injury . Can Narendra Modi visit the Jama Masjid and apologise for 1992 riots ? ''
This comment could be the fourth own-goal that Congress has scored since the onset of campaigning in Gujarat . It may rank alongside blunders such as party 's claims that Rahul is a 'janeu-dhari ' Hindu ( one who wears the sacred thread ) '' , Kapil Sibal 's submission in Supreme Court on delaying Ayodhya verdict till after 2019 elections and Mani Shankar Aiyar 's 'neech ' insult against Modi .
Expectedly , the BJP wasted no time in flagging the demand as 'outrageous ' and framing it within the parameters of 'vote bank politics ' .
Several BJP leaders condemned the statement , with party president Amit Shah telling journalists on Sunday in Gandhinagar that `` entire nation knows the allegations levelled on the prime minister by the Congress backed NGO were all false . Yet for vote bank consolidation , 2002 is being raised in 2017 . ''
It is tough to believe that Congress is unaware of the repercussions of raising the issue of communal riots or attacking Modi personally in their home state bang in the middle of elections . It is either Congress ' attempt at dog-whistling to corner Muslim votes , or another example of its incoherent electoral strategy : Possibly both .
What the grand old party does n't seem to realise is that any mobilisation of Muslim votes through dog-whistling strategies is a game two can play , and BJP is on a much stronger wicket here because it can counter-mobilise the majority sentiment .
This dissonance sends out mixed signals about Congress ' intent and confuses voters . It is also becoming a defining feature of the party under the new boss . Early signals indicate Rahul 's leadership will be little more than a continuation of Congress ' policy of pandering to all impulses—be it majoritarian or minoritarian—in a 'horses for courses ' strategy . While that is hardly a radical departure from the way Sonia handled electoral strategies , Rahul 's job is made difficult by the fact that they lack the finesse to dress rank opportunism as 'savoir faire ' .
Consequently , the new president-elect swings between extremes : Overcompensating while trying to restore balance in positions . In this respect , Rahul is closer to their father who tried to compensate for their Shah Bano blunder by laying the ground for Babri Masjid demolition .
As Shekhar Gupta writes in Print , Rajiv Gandhi `` allowed the unlocking of the Babri Masjid-Ram Janmabhoomi site , pretty much endorsed the temple 's foundation stone laying ( Shilanyas ) and then launched their 1989 campaign from there—with a promise of ushering in Ram Rajya . ''
In the larger context , Rahul 's inconsistent positions risk undermining its larger electoral strategies . It has sought to approach the Pakistan debate once again from a high moral ground by demanding Modi 's apology for ostensibly making a `` social function '' look `` sinister '' through insinuations that it was a `` secret meeting '' .
`` The former prime minister and vice-president were merely attending a social function in which high ( level ) dignitaries were present and it was not a secret meeting… ( At the event ) former chief of army was present , former Indian high commissioners to Pakistan , distinguished diplomats of this country , eminent journalists they were all present and the prime minister gives it a sinister and sensationalist twist ? '' said Congress spokesperson Anand Sharma .
It escaped the Congress that Modi has been building the 'Congress-soft-on-Pakistan ' narrative rather diligently for what it 's worth , and Congress played into their hands by initially sounding abrasive about the meeting .
In response to Modi 's allegations of Pakistan 's interference in Gujarat election , and their statement at a rally that a meeting at Mani Shankar Aiyar 's residence involving Pakistan 's former high commissioner and former minister of external affairs did take place , Sharma called Modi a 'liar ' .
On Sunday , the senior Congress leader dismissed the accusation as a `` lie being sold by the prime minister '' , and told ANI `` only because they are rattled by the defeat that is staring them and the BJP in the face , they should not say such things . If they had this information , and if it is true , which is not , then it would have been an act of treason and action should have been there under law . Why are they crying there ? If there is anything like that , why has they spoken now ? '' asked Sharma .
On Monday , Congress claimed that there was nothing secretive about the meeting .
This apparent inconsistency in argument allowed BJP the chance to bring out a discussion into the open about an allegation that addresses the deepest concerns of our collective psyche . The fact that it took place at Aiyar 's residence , who had , on an earlier occasion , allegedly told a Pakistan TV channel that Modi must be removed for talks to resume only added to the narrative .
In 2015 , Aiyar told Pakistan 's Duniya TV channel : `` Bring us ( the Congress ) back to power and remove them . There is no other way ( to better the relations ) . We will remove them , but till then you ( Pakistan ) have to wait . ''
Modi was playing their cards well . The Congress tried to turn the table on BJP by suggesting that it was Modi who made an unscheduled stop at Lahore at Nawaz Sharif 's invitation , but these attacks do n't affect BJP much since it has secured the 'nationalist ' space in polity .
Meeting Pakistani envoys over dinner surely is n't an exceptional event , but doing so during an Assembly election involving a border state , and being initially abrasive about details , gave Modi just the kind of weapon they were looking for . The Congress made similar blunders during Doka La conflict when Rahul met Chinese envoys reportedly to `` seek details '' : An issue that Modi has kept repeating during Gujarat campaign .
To defeat an excellent communicator like Modi at their game , the first requirement is consistency in messaging . It must be based on a coherent strategy . There is no space for self-goals . The new Congress president-elect has their job cut out .

Sean McVay 's Rams took the league by storm last autumn , scorching opponents with an air-and-ground attack that led the NFL in points .
The team 's newest defensive stars still ca n't believe what they 're seeing .
`` We got an introduction to that McVay offense , '' All-Pro cornerback Aqib Talib , acquired in a trade with the Broncos , said during organized team activities , per ESPN 's Lindsey Thiry . `` It was crazy . ''
Fellow star cover man Marcus Peters , added through a swap with the Chiefs , agreed : `` It 's crazy unique . ''
In their first year as head coach , the 32-year-old McVay helped author one of the league 's more stunning worst-to-first narratives , morphing an offense that birthed an unwatchable , NFL-low 14.0 points per game under Jeff Fisher in 2016 into a powerhouse that pumped out a league-leading 29.9 points per tilt .
`` It 's going to make us a whole lot better because the up-tempo and their play-calling style is crazy unique , '' Peters said . `` It 's going to cause for us to be on our toes a lot . ''
It 's especially high praise coming from Talib , the 32-year-old veteran who spent years in Denver practicing against Peyton Manning and seasons in New England seeing Tom Brady 's magic-spinning up close and personal .
The ill news for Rams opponents is that adding Talib and Peters only improves the offense by forcing McVay 's roster of weapons to face top talent on a daily basis .
`` It 's good competing against them at practice , '' wideout Robert Woods said . `` Very challenging guys , different guys . You see Talib with their experience , you see Peters just jumping the ball . ''
Have we mentioned Los Angeles also added All-Pro defensive lineman Ndamukong Suh to the mix ? For all the talk of what the Rams can do on offense , this defense has the position-by-position talent to create equal excitement .
It 's one reason the Rams roll into September as a not-so-sneaky pick to appear in Super Bowl LIII .
By Giuseppe Fonte
ROME ( Reuters ) - Italy 's political crisis moved into unchartered waters on Wednesday , as the head of state sought a last-minute political compromise to end the three-month search for a government and restore calm to financial markets .
Prime Minister-designate Carlo Cottarelli , tasked by the president with calming tensions and laying plans for repeat elections later this year , raised hopes of a breakthrough on Wednesday with comments suggesting compromise was in the air .
Italy has searched for a government since inconclusive elections in March . Two anti-establishment parties came close to forming a ruling coalition last weekend , but backed away after the president demanded a change in their cabinet lineup .
The 5-Star Movement and the right-wing League abandoned their bid to take power in a coalition after President Sergio Mattarella vetoed their choice of 81-year-old eurosceptic Paolo Savona as economy minister .
The prospect of the political crisis being drawn out further with possible new elections later this year has brought turmoil to financial markets .
But Cottarelli , whom Mattarella brought in as a stop-gap prime minister , was quoted by ANSA news agency as saying that new possibilities had emerged `` for the birth of a political government , '' implying that a government headed by politicians rather than technocrats like themselves could be in the offing .
`` These circumstances , also considering the market tensions , have caused me to wait for further developments . ''
The 5-Star also seemed willing to rethink its weekend decision to defy the president 's veto and go back to elections .
The parties are now trying to find `` a point of compromise on another name '' for the economy ministry , said a source close to 5-Star , the single-biggest party in the new parliament .
League leader Matteo Salvini , who is surging in opinion polls , appeared to throw cold water on the notion that their party and 5-Star could try again to form a coalition .
They said Italy should return to an election as soon as possible . `` The earlier we vote the better because it 's the best way to get out of this quagmire and confusion , '' they told reporters .
They did , however , appear open to an interim administration to govern for a few months , saying an election at the end of July would be `` disruptive '' for Italian seasonal workers .
They invited Mattarella to make the first move , to `` explain to us how we can get out of this situation '' . A League source said the party would not block any quick political solution that would enable Italy to deal with possible `` emergencies '' .
Cottarelli , currently , has no major parliamentary support for a stopgap government of technocrats .
Despite the softer tone from 5-Star and Cottarelli 's intriguing remark , a top adviser to Salvini said the League was not prepared to abandon Savona , the sole obstacle to the League and 5-Star winning the president 's blessing for a coalition .
Repeat elections are likely to lead to a eurosceptic government in Rome , a prospect that has rocked financial markets , with the euro sinking to multi-month lows .
ECB WATCHING CLOSELY
The European Central Bank is keeping a watchful eye on the market rout and political crisis engulfing Italy but sees no reason to intervene at this time , sources said .
Three officials told Reuters the ECB was not considering taking action because indicators were not yet showing signs of stress among banks and the central bank did not have the tools or mandate to solve what was essentially a political crisis .
A surprise breakthrough between the president and 5-Star/League would ease uncertainty but still usher in a coalition planning to ramp up spending in the heavily indebted nation and push for changes to European Union and euro-zone fiscal rules .
In the event of continued stalemate , Italy will go back to elections , with most major parties calling for the president to dissolve parliament and hold a vote as soon as July 29 .
A recent opinion poll showed the League , which says fiscal rules governing the euro zone are `` enslaving '' Italians , would take a quarter of the vote , up from 17 percent on March 4 .
The IPSOS poll , carried out on May 16-17 and published in the Corriere della Sera newspaper on Wednesday , showed support for the League 's would-be coalition partner , the 5-Star Movement , steady at about 32.6 percent -- implying a much more comfortable majority if the pair were to try again to govern .
`` I am worried by the direction things are moving in , '' said Diego Galli , a Rome resident interviewed on the street , adding that the anti-establishment coalition `` seems extremist , against Europe '' .
Italian government bonds , which suffered one of its most dramatic speculative attacks in years on Tuesday , found some support from local investors on Wednesday .
The yield on 10-year bonds edged away from four-year highs and two-year yields , the focus of earlier attacks , also fell .
Shares in Italian banks also recovered a little ground after five straight days of losses .

Tight end Eric Ebron has signed a deal with the Indianapolis Colts . The deal is for two years with a maximum value of $ 15 million , a source told ESPN 's Adam Schefter .
The Detroit Lions released Ebron on March 14 , parting ways with the tight end who never lived up to their first-round draft status .
Ebron was due $ 8.25 million -- not guaranteed -- against the cap in 2018 .
Ebron , who turns 25 in April , was criticized throughout their time with the Lions , starting when they were selected with the No . 10 overall pick in the 2014 draft ahead of future Pro Bowlers Aaron Donald , Taylor Lewan , Odell Beckham Jr. and C.J . Mosley .
Ebron was often compared to those players -- particularly by fans -- because at the time , drafting a tight end was viewed as more of a luxury pick by a Detroit team that had more substantial needs .
Ebron also struggled to produce early in their career ; they had 25 catches for 248 yards and one touchdown as a rookie , with an 8.3 percent drop rate . Drops have been an issue for Ebron their entire career ; they have a career drop rate of 7.3 percent , although they have improved on it over the past two seasons as they have worked into Detroit 's offense more .
In 2016 , Ebron posted career highs in receptions ( 61 ) and yards ( 711 ) . It was believed that 2017 would finally be their breakout year , but that did n't turn out to be the case in the first half .
Ebron had 18 catches for 195 yards over the first eight games , leading to them being viewed as a potential trade candidate around the deadline . The nadir for Ebron came in Week 8 against Pittsburgh , when fans booed them every time Matthew Stafford threw them the ball or their picture was shown on the Ford Field big screen during a nationally televised night game .
Ebron started to turn things around in that game , though , catching a 44-yard pass in the fourth quarter that gave Detroit a shot to win the game in an eventual 20-15 loss . Afterward , Ebron talked openly about not knowing what would happen with their future .
The Lions did n't move Ebron then , and they responded with the best stretch of their career . Over the final eight games of 2017 , Ebron had 35 catches for 379 yards and three touchdowns , including a 10-catch , 94-yard game in a win over Tampa Bay that Detroit needed to stay in the playoff race .

LAHORE-Abdullah Qureshi takes a trip down memory lane with their latest single ‘ Kali Santro ' . ‘ Kali Santro ' translates into ‘ Black Santro ' which was the first car Abdullah Qureshi owned .
The single is a nostalgic journey to times past , remembering the setbacks caused by the ‘ Kali Santro ' with fondness and cherishing the memories the car has for Abdullah Qureshi .
‘ Kali Santro ' is sung in Punjabi , imbibing multiple influences such as Johnny Cash and Noor Jehan resulting in a sound not attempted before in Pakistan . A Punjabi country song which is reminisced of the fifties era .
The raw vocals of Abdullah Qureshi are complimented by Nimra Mehra who reenacts the sound of the fifties with panache . The single is composed and written by Abdullah Qureshi with Melvin Arthur on the banjo and fretless bass and produced by Hassan Omer .
The video of ‘ Kali Santro ' is a reflective of the song 's reverie state , blending comedy and drama in a dream . Abdulah plays the male lead as a Punjabi Driver and Mahila Chaudhary as the female lead who plays the “ Melody Queen ” and lip syncs Nimra Mehra 's vocals .
Set in a local dhaba ( café ) , the concert like video blends the old with the new , East with West and the fusion result in vivid colors in a tavern like setting with the banjo playing in the background . Known for their unconventional conceptualization , the video is directed by Usman Mukhtar who also directed Abdullah Qureshi 's first video “ Dastan ” .

FinTech , or new financial technology , driven financial inclusion , will add at 4 million jobs , 93 million bank accounts , $ 36 billion annually to GNP , and $ 7 billion net to Pakistan Government revenue by 2025 , according to McKinsey . Bank accounts seem to be on track as there are 7 million today . That includes 1.8 million traditional accounts , accumulated over 50 years , and 5.2 million mobile/branchless accounts accumulated in around a 1/10th of that time . This is because globally , traditional bank accounts rise proportionately to GNP , but mobile accounts can rise exponentially . So the State Bank target of 50 million accounts by 2020 should be on track , as the McKinsey forecast .
Most new entrants will be women and the poor , which is heartening . Women tend to spend more on health and education for their families from their earnings , which will target the unconscionable malnutrition and unschooled children issue in Pakistan . Digitizing the informal economy drives out inefficiencies and increases competition . Together with increased availability of credit , ( $ 23 bil annually for individuals and MSME by 2025 , ) better cash management , ( farmers in one African country were able to spend 13 % on grain and fertilizer , ) and better Government revenue collection and grants allocations , the impact of a digital economy is widespread and pervasive .
Financial Service providers like banks and other new entrants will benefit from 60 % -90 % lower transaction costs , above $ 250 billion of new deposits by 2025 , and the ability to offer new products with better managed risk .
Businesses will benefit from access to credit , higher efficiencies and new business models . Governments will benefit from more revenue collection from digitization of the economy and less revenue leakage in programs like BISP . Individuals will benefit from better cash flow management , convenience , lower transaction cost , and access to better products and more options due to greater competition among vendors and service providers .
Some key drivers appear to be in place : Expanding internet coverage , MOIT plans to provide Internet access to all villages in the country with a population of more than a 100 by mid 2018 , smartphone penetration , mobile broadband connections , and a biometrically verified national identification system .
But others are weak , such as financial credit levels , which reduce Pakistan 's prospects even compared to other low income countries like Nigeria and Ethiopia . Regulatory burdens , such as on the import of hardware components and 3D printers , weak judicial system for the enforcement of business contracts and IPR protection , for example , unjustifiable harassment by tax authorities , and lack of enough quality human resources impede startups that develop FinTech products .
Development of skills of the future in programming , creativity , initiative , and digital literacy is a key requirement . Currently there is a gap between what universities product and market demand , and output is very low at less than half a million college graduates a year for a country of 207 million . Some bright spots need to be built upon : The growth in female graduates has been one of the highest in the world at 25 % a year , raising the percentage of female college graduates from 18 % to 48 % in less than a decade . That required a social re-engineering of parental attitudes in rural areas . Publications in internationally reputable research journals per capita is better than BRICS countries , which required an adept re-steering of the higher education system . More upstream in the value chain , the primary education system has to become fun , and not kill curiosity in children .
A Makerspace revolution , which enables tinkering and creative projects using wood , electronics , robots , and other material , like the one in the USA , could be the answer there . A Makerspace in the USA can cost anywhere from $ 80,000 to $ 500,000 , but a Lahore Startup has crafted a Makerspace in a Box , ideal for Government schools , which costs Rs 150,000 .
The award of Third Party Service Provider license after the Payment Service Provider licenses by the State Bank and PTA , will place a bank and telco-agnostic payments backbone in place , which is far more efficient and scalable compared to one-off linkages between banks and wallets or other FinTech services , like mortgages , deposits , credits , and insurance .
New business models based on micro payments , peer to peer services , block chain , AI and IoT should also evolve : Examples include blockchain and IoT based digitization of supply chains with automation of contract fulfilment verification , and AI based credit worthiness scores which will be far more reliable than current mechanisms .
In banking-FinTech relationships , Banks can take on the regulatory compliance task , while true 10x startups can take on the innovation task . And then there will be disruptors , of the kind Jack Ma terms TechFin !
BERLIN ( Reuters ) - German Chancellor Angela Merkel 's conservatives and the Social Democrats ( SPD ) sought to resolve disputes on healthcare and labour rules on Saturday during talks to form a government more than four months after an election .
The two camps aim to seal a deal to renew the “ grand coalition ” that has governed Europe 's largest economy since 2013 by the end of Sunday , although some politicians say they could run into Monday or Tuesday .
SPD deputy Manuela Schwesig urged the conservatives to compromise on abolishing fixed-term contracts for workers and reforming Germany 's public-private healthcare system .
“ I do n't think Mrs Merkel can explain why there ca n't be any movement there , ” they said as they arrived for talks .
The SPD wants to prove to its sceptical members that it would be able to push through those core policies in the role of junior partner to make another “ grand coalition ” more appealing .
Many of the SPD 's 443,000 members - who will get the chance to vote on any coalition deal - would prefer to revamp the party in opposition rather than another alliance with Merkel after suffering their worst post-war election result in September .
As a compromise , the conservatives have offered to ban the repeated renewal of fixed-term contracts but they do not want to prevent employers from using them . The parties are still working on the topic .
The two camps made some progress on labour policy on Friday by agreeing that employees in companies with more than 45 employees should have the right to move seamlessly back and forth between full- and part-time work . [ nL8N1PS4JF ]
MAJOR OBSTACLE

Healthcare is a big stumbling block and party sources said Merkel and their Bavarian ally Horst Seehofer discussed the issue before meeting with the SPD .
The conservatives reject replacing the current system with a “ citizen 's insurance ” as called for by the SPD and talks are now expected to focus on improving the position of those with public healthcare such as by changing billing rules for doctors , who earn more by treating private patients .
In a sign they are getting closer to a deal , the parties reached an accord on energy and environment , agreeing to set legally binding climate targets for sectors like energy , transport , agriculture and construction to reach by 2030 .
Environment Minister Barbara Hendricks said national climate targets for 2020 would not be quite reached but the new targets , which would be written into law in 2019 , would ensure Germany can remain a “ climate protection pioneer ” .
They also agreed on agriculture , saying they wanted to put an end to the use of weedkiller glyphosate as quickly as possible and ban the cultivation of genetically modified plants .
In a full day of negotiations , the parties were also hoping to tick off issues including finances , rents and real estate prices and municipalities .
They reached a deal on migration on Friday , agreeing to stick to the wording of January 's coalition blueprint that said the parties did not expect annual migration to exceed 220,000 per year .
But the two were still wrangling over its meaning on Saturday , with Joachim Herrmann - a member of Merkel 's CSU Bavarian allies who have called for an upper limit - telling Rheinische Post their party had secured a migrant cap .
Meanwhile , SPD deputy Ralf Stegner insisted the number is merely a prediction , writing on Twitter : “ The fact remains that the SPD has not agreed to any upper limit and will not do so . ”
Migration is a sensitive issue given the influx of more than a million migrants since mid-2015 and the conservatives ' subsequent loss of support to the anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany ( AfD ) in September 's national election .
Ministry of Highways crews along with members of the Peachland Fire Department diverted water that had sent mud and debris onto Highway 97 Monday afternoon .
The small mud slide happened around 4 p.m. north of Princeton Avenue .
A private culvert had burst above the highway .
As water flowed down the hillside , it washed the mud onto the highway .
Crews created a series of diversions with rocks along the hillside to guide the water into ditches .
Traffic was slowed , but not brought to a standstill .
Former Luton defender Scott Cuthbert has signed for League Two Stevenage on a two year deal .
The 30-year-old was released by Hatters boss Nathan Jones recently , ending their three year stint at Kenilworth Road and has opted to make the Lamex Stadium their new home .
Speaking to the club 's official website about their decision to remain in League Two , Cuthbert said : `` I am really looking forward to it . It 's always a tense summer when you 're without a club , but I met the manager ( Dino Maamria ) a few weeks ago and I was really impressed by the set up of the training ground , really impressed with the plans that he 's got for the future with the team .
`` I was fortunate after leaving Luton that I had a little bit of interest in this division and League One as well . I think it 's important that you talk to all the managers and get a feel for the club and the way they want to go , move forward and certainly the gaffer here was very enthusiastic about the place .
`` He obviously knows the club inside out with their history here . The way they want to play and the way they wanted me to be part of the team and showed that real intent to come and get me and be part of their plan , for a player that 's always great , so I 'd say that 's the one thing that stands out for me . ''
Having played 111 times for Luton , including 25 matches in this season 's promotion to League One , and over 350 games during their career , Cuthbert believe their knowledge will be vital for their new side , as they continued : `` When you 're in League Two , it 's a real tough division . Every game it 's intense as anything , Saturday , Tuesday , long trips away on a Tuesday night and you need that experience in your team. ,
`` I know there 's a little bit of experience and I feel that I can add to that as well , especially captaining Luton to promotion last year out of this division , it certainly helps and that will be one of the reasons I 'm here I 'm sure . ''
Cuthbert joins up with a number of ex-Hatters currently at Stevenage and a few of their former team-mates as well , adding : `` I 've played with Alex Revell , twice at Swindon and Leyton Orient , I 've played with Jamal Campbell-Ryce a little bit , Jonathan Smith , Luke Wilkinson .
`` So I certainly know a couple of the lads which is always nice when you 're joining a new team , you 've got a few familiar faces to help you settle in for the first couple of weeks . ''

More than a baker 's dozen of flour products have been pulled from grocery store shelves .
As of April 16 , Ardent Mills recalled 16 varieties of Robin Hood and Creative Baker flour from stores across Canada with a wide range of product codes and package sizing .
`` As a result of the food-safety investigation , the Canadian Food Inspection Agency ( CFIA ) identified additional products that could pose a health risk . Those products have now been added to the updated recall warning , '' CFIA spokesperson Maria Kubacki said on Monday .
`` The CFIA is warning the public not to consume these products , '' they added . `` If consumers have any of the recalled products in their home , they should throw them out or return them to the store where they purchased them . ''
On its website , Ardent Mills said it is co-operating with CFIA 's food safety inspection and direction to expand the flour-products recall .
`` Ardent Mills is aware of one illness associated with the consumption of flour , and thankfully that person has fully recovered , '' the company said in a press release . `` There have been no illnesses reported with the products subject to the April 12 and 16 voluntary recalls . ''
The company noted it is committed to doing all it can to provide ingredients that make safe , healthy and good tasting products .
But it does add that `` flour is a raw agriculture commodity made from wheat , which is grown outdoors where bacteria and microbes , such as E. coli O121 , are often present . ''
The release seems to suggest that because there is no heat process used to cure the wheat , it remains possible that E. coli O121 can still be harboured in the product until it is cooked .
`` The normal milling process uses the simple , time-honoured traditions that were invented more than 100 years ago . Today 's mills , however , have significantly improved food safety . Nonetheless , neither the original process nor today 's process contain a kill step to eliminate microbes , such as E. coli O121 that may originate with the wheat . Common kill steps applied during food preparation include thoroughly boiling , baking , roasting , microwaving and frying . These so-called kill steps will render the microbes or bacteria harmless . ''
Initially , only 10-kilogram bags of Robin Hood All Purpose Flour with code BB/MA 2018 AL 17 and 6 291 548 that were sold in British Columbia , Alberta , Saskatchewan and Manitoba were considered to have been possibly contaminated with E-coli .
But as of April 4 , the Public Health Agency of Canada opened the recall up to be one of national concern .
As of Sunday , Robin Hood bags of varying sizes containing the following codes are being recalled :
Lot codes :
BB/MA 2018 FE 02 and 6 307 548
BB/MA 2018 FE 03 and 6 308 548
BB/MA 2018 AL 26 and 6 300 548
BB/MA 2018 AL 26 and 6 300 548
BB/MA 2018 JA 24 and 6 298 548
BB/MA 2018 JA 25 and 6 299 548
BB/MA 2018 AL 25 and 6 299 548
BB/MA 2017 AU 25 and 6 299 548
BB/MA 2018 AL 27 and 6 301 548
BB/MA 2018 AL 28 and 6 302 548
BB/MA 2018 AL 28 and 6 307 548
BB/MA 2018 AL 29 and 6 303 548
Additionally , Creative Baker All Purpose Flour , 10-kg bags with lot code BB/MA 2017 OC 26 6 300 SK is also being recalled .

A senior living complex that once was to be as large as a Walmart big box store won the approval Thursday of the Encinitas Planning Commission after it underwent a months-long redesign that cut the number of units by 23 percent .
It will still have a `` a bit of an impact '' on El Camino Real traffic conditions and nearby homes , but not nearly as much as the earlier version , Commission Chairman Glenn O'Grady said . And , they added , this site may be one of the last remaining options in town for any large senior housing complex .
`` If not there , then where ? We 're getting built out , '' they said .
The commission 's vote was 4-0 , with Commissioner Greg Drakos absent .
Members of the neighboring residents ' group that formed to oppose the original plans said after the vote that they will definitely appeal the commission 's decision to the City Council , saying a large senior living complex is too intensive a development for the site near San Elijo Lagoon .
Westmont Living 's new proposal for the property -- a mostly vacant parcel just north of the Temple Solel synagogue and El Camino 's intersection with Manchester Road -- calls for an 85,879-square-foot building with 93 housing suites for seniors . It replaces plans for a 110,073-square-foot structure with 122 suites .
The Planning Commission rejected Westmont 's initial proposal in May 2016 , saying it was too massive for the site . In the months since , the developers have held community meetings and reworked the plans .
`` We listened carefully to the community , '' project manager Bob Trettin told the commissioners , declaring that they now have a `` revised and improved project . ''
Among other things , they and project architect Aaron Clark said , they have :
Eliminated a 21-bed area for Alzheimer 's patients and other senior citizens with severe memory loss ; Dropped plans for a basement area that gave the building a three-story look ; Decided to tuck the building into the hillside , making it look more like a one-story structure than a two-story one'Changed the proposed building colors from blues to golden harvest tones to make the structure look less industrial : And agreed to replace some of the historic Torrey pines that will be removed for a road-widening project.Trettin said there was one thing the developers were not willing to do . They would not agree to exchange the one proposed big building for several smaller senior housing structures .
`` To have those residents going between buildings is not safe , '' they said .
Neighboring homeowners said the developers had n't really listened to their concerns about the project and called Thursday 's presentation a flashy snow job , contending that the architectural renderings and view corridor pictures did n't reflect reality .
`` What we saw here tonight was a sales job -- It was a timeshare sales job , '' said Richard Markell , an equine veterinarian who lives on El Camino Court .
They said the new project may not be the size of a Walmart or a Home Depot , but it 's still the size of a Best Buy store and that 's too large .
Their neighbor , Marilyn Dulich , agreed .
`` It 's the wrong use of the property , '' they said , noting that if the developers put houses on the site they would only be allowed about nine of them given the property 's zoning . `` It 's intense . It 's just an intense use . ''
The planning commissioners , most of whom were not on the commission when the earlier proposal was rejected , approved the new plans with several conditions . Those conditions included a requirement that Torrey pines eliminated by the construction plans be replaced on a one-to-one basis if possible ; that the project 's retaining walls be `` generously '' covered with vines ; and that food and other deliveries to the future senior complex only occur between 7 a.m. and 7 p.m .
Justin Turner electrifies the crowd with a three-run home run in the bottom of the first to give the Dodgers a quick 3-0 lead .
Chris Taylor led off the inning with a single and Corey Seager walked off a struggling Taijuan Walker .
Cody Bellinger followed Turner 's homer with a single to center . Still no one out with Yasiel Puig at bat .
Puig doubles to right-center to score Bellinger . Even the national broadcast guys are giving the Dodgers credit , so it must be a great inning .
Curtis Granderson follows by striking out . Yasmani Grandal also strikes out , and the Diamondbacks walk Logan Forsythe intentionally to bring up Clayton Kershaw , who strikes out to end the inning .

A drizzle could make the ground wet in the hours leading to the Rose Parade in Pasadena Monday , but forecasters are not expecting any real rain .
“ It 's a pretty good chance the ground will be wet — damp is what we 're expecting . Not like measurable rain , ” said National Weather Service meteorologist Carol Smith . More likely is “ light showers or drizzle that can get the ground wet . ”
The drizzle is more likely in the early morning hours , and it 's possible that the drizzle could extend into the early part of the parade , said weather service meteorologist Curt Kaplan . It 's also possible the drizzle could stop , and the parade itself will start with mostly cloudy conditions that lead into partly cloudy skies by the time it ends .
If Monday 's Rose Parade is spared a downpour , officials will undoubtedly point to the celebration 's “ Never on Sunday ” rule as a reason , in which the parade is moved to Jan. 2 if New Year 's Day falls on a Sunday . ( However , those who may be more skeptical may point to the fact that skies were clear in Pasadena on Jan. 1 this year . )
The custom of shifting the parade a day later when New Year 's Day falls on a Sunday began in 1893 to avoid riling the horses hitched outside church and possibly disrupting the services inside .
The flower-bedecked procession has been rained on only 10 times in its 127 years . And this is only the 15th time in its 128-year history that the Rose Parade will be held on a Monday , Jan. 2 .
The last time the rain came was in 2006 — a year that the parade was also held on a Monday , Jan. 2 . And it came in a downpour .
As The Times reported back then :
Cheerleaders kept their game face through cascades of running mascara . Flag twirlers had to deal with sodden pennants that bunched up like wet laundry . And hundreds upon hundreds of marching band members were soaked down to their arpeggios .
Times staff writer Gale Holland contributed to this report .

Westville police , who were assisted by the RCMP , say they discovered two people and three family pets had perished in the fire .
The victims have been identified as Pennual Louise Duggan , 84 , and their 56-year-old son Carl Allan Crawford .
“ The investigation is still underway but we have no reason at this time to believe it 's a suspicious fire , ” Chief Donald Hussher of the Westville Police Service told Global News .

Marvel 's Black Widow solo film , starring Scarlett Johansson , will reportedly be a prequel featuring Winter Soldier
After waiting for years for a standalone Black Widow movie , Marvel finally gave us confirmation earlier this year that it was in the works after all .
It was announced that screenwriter Jac Schaffer was hired to pen the film with Scarlett Johansson to reprise their role . But , since then , there has been a disquieting secrecy regarding the movie and there have not been any interesting developments to speak of .
But according to That Hashtag Show 's Joseph Deckelmeir , the Black Widow movie will be a Red Sparrow-style prequel , rather than a sequel . Citing an anonymous-but-trusted source , they report that the movie will be set 15 years after the fall of the Soviet Union with Natasha Romanoff having now made America their home . This , of course , would place the movie 's events somewhere in the mid-2000s , a few years prior to their official MCU debut in Iron Man 2 ( 2010 ) .
In addition , That Hashtag Show reports that the movie could feature Sebastian Stan 's James Buchanan “ Bucky ” Barnes aka the Winter Soldier . This sure gives context to Stan 's recent excitement in a recent interview with Bad Taste about reprising their role alongside Johannson once again .
“ They have a very nice history in my opinion , '' said Stan . `` It 's very intricate…the truth is they actually taught them in the comic books . They were a teacher to them It 's all set during a specific , interesting time . The Cold War . It 's all a very… spy , thrillerish , noirish story…it would be very interesting to explore that on film . I would love if the do that . You know , I hope . Maybe they will . ”
Marvel Studios are yet to announce a director for the Black Widow solo film but it is rumoured to fall into Marvel 's early Phase 4 slate in 2020 , which itself is yet to be confirmed .
Of course , we 'll have a better idea of Romanoff 's fate after we watch Infinity War and Avengers 4 and it should n't be long before Marvel gives us a more satisfying update .
Johansson , who has enjoyed a top billing at five since the first Avengers movie , will reprise their role as Black Widow in Avengers : Infinity War .
The Russo brothers-directed Marvel movie releases this Friday ( 27 April ) .

A famous Montreal steakhouse , and landmark , is gone . Le Biftheque on Côte-de-Liesse Road in the borough of Saint-Laurent , for decades a favourite of many Montrealers , has been torn down .
The restaurant has had a rough go recently . It closed in 2011 , reopened , and closed again in 2015 . Because the building has been abandoned for years , the borough of Saint-Laurent says it had ultimately become unsafe .
“ So in that sense , ” explains borough mayor Alan DeSousa , “ even though we 're losing a bit of familiarity of what we 've known over the years , in this case for the safety of the community and of people in the area , it made sense . ”
Several long-time patrons say the Biftheque has been part of their lives for many years .
Ralph Longo works in the area and says it 's a huge loss . “ I came here many times with my family when I was a kid , ” they tell Global News , “ and it 's been an icon on the street . ”
Concordia University communications studies professor Matt Soar has been working on a project exploring what signs mean to people . They say when landmarks go , it can be unsettling .
“ When something disappears , ” they say , “ it really reminds us how much of a feature of our lives that was , the experience of living in a particular community , or having certain patterns in terms of where we want to eat or buy our food or shop , and when those things change , it reminds us how ephemeral it all really is . ”
It 's not clear yet what will take the Biftheque 's place .
Bronzers , warm tones , and nude lips ? Sounds basically perfect , right ? Well , get excited , beauty lovers , because a collection containing all of these elements is coming at you thanks to one of the world 's biggest brands and most popular gurus . The new MAC x Patrick Starrr summer collection has officially been unveiled by Starrr , and it 's a doozy in the great way .
On Wednesday , Starrr took to their Twitter account to announce that he 'd be uploading a special video to their Youtube channel shortly , and now , fans know what it is . Starrr debuted the promo video for their latest collection with MAC Cosmetics , and it 's the perfect summer time set of products with gorgeously colorful packaging and warmer weather ready shades .
In the video , fans get a glimpse of what 's included in the new collection from the guru and the brand , and it honestly looks so good . There appears to be a new bronzer in this collection as well as a highlighter ( according to a post from TrendMood ) , two new gorgeous nude glosses , and a gorgeous warm-toned eyeshadow quad that pretty much screams summer . Basically , the collection , called the Diva Feva collection , is the perfect combination of summery products and shades that you should totally get ready to shop .
But when ?
PatrickStarrr on YouTube
According to the description box of Starrr 's video , the new products will be launching online on June 4 and in stores June 7 . If you 're so ready to get your hands on these goods , you 've barely got a week to wait until you can shop them in stores .
As for pricing , there 's been no word on it as of press time . However , Starrr 's collaborations have been relatively affordable . They wo n't totally break your bank . Their spring Floral Realness collection included two bundles that featured a quad eyeshadow palette , lipstick , lip gloss , and a split pan blush all for $ 50 . Not a bad deal , right ? It seems unlikely that prices would skyrocket from their previous affordability for a summer collection .
How do fans feel about the new goods coming from Starrr and MAC ? Good . They feel good .
One of the voices happy for Starrr just so happens to be Claudia Soare , president of Anastasia Beverly Hills .
She 's not alone , though . Fans are praising Starrr 's latest work with the brand .
They 're shaken over the new collaboration that is coming right on the heels of the spring Floral Realness campaign and launch .
For some , this collection deserves a serious round of applause .
Of course , they 're ready to spend their hard earned cash on the launch .
Starrr did n't just help create the products , though . According to their Twitter , they have also had creative control over the marketing for both this new collection and their spring one . Talk about a multi-talented artist , right ? MAC has given them full reign on how to craft the marketing materials , and after seeing this video and their Floral Realness images , can you blame them ? Everything is stunning .

1 . Status Quo
There you are , just a regular kid… a land dweller . You probably did “ team sports ” and things with a ball . The only time you ever hit the water was at the Rec or for a shower . This is your world , the ordinary world and you have never known any different .
2 . Call to Adventure
You ask your friend to come over and stay the night to play video games , but they reply with “ Ca n't , I got swim practice. ” They 've said that before , but this time it 's different because they follow up with “ Wan na join me at practice ? ”
3 . Refusal of the Call
Practice ? At six in the morning ? ON A SATURDAY ! ? Yeah right… maybe next time . I like my sleep , my time , and my land activities . Why would I ever give that up to jump into freezing water two hours before the sun comes up and force myself to hold my breath constantly while I use every muscle in my body… no thanks .
4 . Meeting the Mentor
For some reason PE class is at the pool and you have to go back and forth… back and forth . Boring , but easy enough . After class on the way to the locker the teacher , who is also the swim team coach , stops you and says “ You have some good feel for the water ( whatever that means ) and a lot of potential . If you want that potential to mean something you need a teacher… a team . Practice , tomorrow , be there . ”
5 . Crossing the Threshold
You never refuse a dare or a challenge , so you are here at the pool for your first practice . Everyone seems to have a lot of stuff with them : goggles , caps , fins… You did n't bring any of that . But the team hands you what you need , teaches you how to read a clock and swim in a circle . And for the first time you jump into the pool as a swimmer , into the special world of clocks and water .
6 . Trials
At first , you were at the end of the lane behind all the other swimmers . But you did n't quit because every day you got better ( and the friends were n't so bad either ) . Soon , you were leading your lane . Soon after you were leading your heat . And after a season of training , racing and making friends and enemies… the time had come to face your biggest challenge .
7 . The Approach
The big meet was just a few weeks away and taper had begun . Throughout the season you had never felt so tired and hungry so constantly . But now that the resting had begun , you can feel your body and mind get sharper… it 's time to race !
8 . The Ordeal
Four days of prelims and finals , what kind of swim meet is this ! ? It is the most grueling event you have ever done , but your body is staying strong and performing beyond your expectations . The coach , your team and your self are beyond impressed with the results and everyone is killing it !
9 . The Reward
After the meet , you discover this was just a stepping stone swim meet and that you actually made cut times for the next level ! On top of that , you get some mail from college programs around the country asking you to swim for them . Coach is proud and says “ I saw all this from the beginning of course . ”
10 . The Return
You return to the pool , except this time it 's a new team and a new season . By now , the season is familiar to you : Train , taper , race , win . But this season is different . Injury plagues you , school is overwhelming and even though you did everything right and tried your best , the end of the season results in you losing . Not only losing , but you do n't even go the best time !
11 . Resurrection
You never quit though , you 've learned that much from the water . You slug out a few more years training , a couple best times here and there , but for the most part your swimming career is over and it 's time to become a swammer , to return to the ordinary world of land dwellers .
12 . Resolution
Years later you have a successful career based on the lessons you learned from the pool : dedication , toughness , even ingenuity . All of a sudden , your local club has a vacancy and they need a coach . They need you and your experience .

KIEV/MOSCOW ( Reuters ) - A dissident Russian journalist reported murdered in Kiev on Tuesday dramatically reappeared alive on Wednesday during a televised briefing by Ukrainian state security about the killing , which they then said they had faked .
Authorities said Arkady Babchenko was shot dead at their flat and found by their wife in a pool of blood .
But they took to the podium before stunned reporters and said they had been part of a Ukrainian operation to thwart a Russian attempt on their life and expose those behind it .
“ I would like to apologise for what you have all had to go through , ” said Babchenko , who looked on the verge of tears . “ I 'm sorry but there was no other way of doing it . Separately , I want to apologise to my wife for the hell that they have been through . ”
Their reappearance elicited gasps , then cheers and applause from journalists at the briefing .
Babchenko , 41 , is a critic of President Vladimir Putin and Russian policy in Ukraine and Syria .
Their reported murder sparked a war of words between Ukraine and Russia . The two countries have been at odds since a popular revolt in Ukraine in 2014 toppled a Russian-backed government in favour of a pro-Western one .
It also produced a flurry of condemnations from European capitals and Washington , and sent shivers through the journalistic communities in both countries .
This was in part because several prominent Russian journalists critical of Putin 's policies have been murdered in recent years . Opposition groups and human rights organizations say the Kremlin is behind the killings . The Kremlin denies this .
But there were signs of a backlash against Ukraine . Some media organisations said the staged plot undermined the credibility of journalists . Others said it had handed the Kremlin a propaganda gift .
Babchenko praised the operation , however , and thanked the Ukrainian Security Service , the SBU , for saving their lives . They said the most important thing was that what they called other big acts of terror had been thwarted .
They later took to Twitter , promising to die “ when I am 96 after having danced on Putin 's grave ” .
STING PLOT
The SBU said it received information about a plot to kill 30 people in Ukraine , including Babchenko , but had thwarted it .
The security service declined to say who the other 29 people were but said it had detained a Ukrainian citizen recruited by Russia to find someone to kill Babchenko . They were given $ 40,000 to organise the murder , $ 30,000 for the killer and $ 10,000 for being an intermediary , the SBU said .
The detained man had been ordered to buy weapons , including 300 Kalashnikovs , grenade launchers , and explosives which were to be stashed in central Ukraine , it added . A video of the man being detained was shown to reporters .
“ We managed not only to break this cynical provocation , but also to document the preparation of this shameful crime by Russian special services , ” SBU chief Vasyl Hrytsak said .

General Prosecutor Yuriy Lutsenko , who appeared alongside Babchenko , said it had been necessary to fake the journalist 's death so that the organisers of the plot to kill them would believe they had succeeded .
Ukraine 's prime minister , foreign minister , the European Union , the United States and the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe were among the many to condemn Babchenko 's reported murder .
News that they were alive brought a mixture of relief and praise for the Ukrainian security services , including from President Petro Poroshenko , but a backlash from certain quarters about how the incident was handled .
“ Reporters Without Borders expresses its sharp indignation on learning of the Ukrainian secret service 's manipulation carried out as part of an information war , ” Christophe Deloire , secretary general of Reporters Without Borders , said on social media . “ It is always very dangerous for states to play with facts and especially on the backs of journalists . ”
Poroshenko welcomed Babchenko with a hug at the presidential administration and said the journalist and their family would be given protection .
RUSSIAN MOCKERY
Russian state media mocked Ukraine for solving a murder it had staged itself , while the Russian Foreign ministry said it was happy that Babchenko was alive , but said Ukraine has used their story as propaganda .
The New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists said it was also unimpressed .
“ We are relieved that Arkady Babchenko is alive , ” said the CPJ 's Nina Ognianova . “ ( But ) Ukrainian authorities must now disclose what necessitated the extreme measure of staging news of the Russian journalist 's murder . ”
But in Kiev journalists who had gathered in the central Maidan square to mourn Babchenko cracked open champagne .
“ That was the best news conference in my life , ” said Olga Musafirova . “ I have never experienced such emotions at any official event . We watched ... at a studio of a TV channel and I realized that I burst into tears and it was tears of joy . ”
Another journalist , Sergiy Grishyn , said “ Babchenko will have to give me money for pills ” for the stress he 'd suffered .
Anton Gerashchenko , an adviser to the interior minister , who had announced Babchenko 's death on Tuesday , went on Facebook on Wednesday to compare the operation to the fictional detective Sherlock Holmes faking their own death .
Babchenko has lived in the Ukrainian capital since receiving threats at home for saying they did not mourn the victims of a Russian military plane crash .
Ukrainian Prime Minister Volodymyr Groysman had said in a social media posting late on Tuesday that they were convinced what they called “ the Russian totalitarian machine ” had not forgiven Babchenko for what Groysman called their honesty .

Moscow has described the allegations as part of an anti-Russian smear campaign .
As a goaltender , Teanna Sieben knows a little pain just comes with the position .
In fact , they embrace it .
“ When I get bruises , it just means I saved it , ” Sieben said . “ It brings excitement and I just love seeing the look on their face , of disappointment because I saved the shot . ”
You see , Sieben has never been one to shy away from a challenge . She 's faced them since day one .
Sieben was born with influenza pneumonia . The medication they received to treat the illness left them with profound hearing loss .
“ I got my first hearing aid when I was two , but then my hearing got worse , ” they said . “ So I got my first cochlear implant when I was five . ”

A cochlear implant is an electronic medical device that replaces the function of the damaged inner ear .
“ It picks up the sounds , goes through a computer magnet , and it sends it to my brain and it just pulls it down together and that 's how I hear you guys , ” Sieben said .
By age 10 , they were almost completely deaf and was approved to have a second cochlear implant surgery .
“ Huge difference , ” they said . “ It was the first time I heard birds chirping , whispering , all the low sounds . ”
But sport has also had a profound impact on their life . Growing up in Estevan , Sask. , they never let their disability stop them from playing every sport possible .
“ It was important because it helped me make friends , communicate with each other better , ” Sieben said . “ I do n't need to hear right , I can just look at them like ‘ oh , that 's what you 're saying . ' ”
At age 13 , they found lacrosse and it stuck .
For the last few years , Sieben has travelled to work with ELEV8 Lacrosse .
At first , it was an adjustment for both them and their coaches .
“ You really have to use your hands a little bit , communicate a different style , but they pick it up very quickly , ” ELEV8 Lacrosse director of operations and player development , Bob Snider said . “ It 's almost like they can read our minds a little bit , so they kind of figures it out very quickly .
“ We love working with her , she 's incredibly positive , always has a smile on their face , always upbeat , works their tail off . ”
“ It totally changed up my coaching style , but they definitely pay more attention , ” ELEV8 Lacrosse coach Shawn Teixeira said . “ She stares at you and looks you in the eye , she 's watching your mouth , and they take direction really good because of that . ”
Now 18 years old , Sieben 's goal is to land a post-secondary scholarship south of the border .
“ No one in my family has gone to college with sport , so that would be a huge deal for me and my family , ” Sieben said .

“ She 's a tender , she 's a number one contender , ” Teixeira said . “ When we 're out at a tournament , we had coaches filling the sidelines waiting to see their play , coming up to use being like what 's they like , what 's they like can I get their attention , can I get her . ”
The pride carries from their coaching staff to their family .
“ We 're really proud of her , ” their uncle Travis Perry said . “ She 's really taken a hold of this passion of hers , and it 's really inspiring for all of us . ”
“ Be nice to have a billboard outside of our town ( Estevan ) with , ‘ home of Teanna Sieben , ' like you see with so many hockey players out there . ”
Sieben meanwhile , is hoping they can make an even greater impact . They have a message for anyone with a disability .
“ If you want to do this path , like this sport and you want to play and someone is telling you not to do it , just do it , prove them wrong , ” they said .
“ I just tell them to follow your dreams , you may want to give up but do n't give up , do n't regret it , just follow your dreams . ”
KAMALIA-Hundreds of citizens protested in front of Kamalia Press Club and demanded restoration of electricity disconnected due to the rain and windstorm two days ago .
The affected areas include Mohallah Hussain Shah , Eid-Gah Chowk , Mohallah Muhibb Ali Shah , Mohallah Sadiq Abad , Chak 733 G/B and Mouza Qadir Buksh . The protesters chanted slogans against the delay in restoration work . The protesters said that there has been no drinking water in their homes and their families had been suffering in the scorching heat . The protesters stated that the electricity company teams arrive promptly to cut power supply for failing to pay electricity bill on time but are taking their merry time in restoring the electricity to their homes notwithstanding Ramazan and the severe summer heat .
Awam League Chairman Riaz Fatyana expressed their concern while talking to our correspondent . They stated that the elected representatives have failed to take care of the people in this time of distress . They demanded electric supply be immediately restored to all areas of the Kamalia city .
A new year , a new you . For many of us that means lacing up our sneakers and hitting the pavement – for the first time in a long time . But what 's the best way to get back into shape and actually stick to it ? Obstacle course race trainer Allison Tai is here to explain them method .
The Angels came back from a four-run deficit to defeat the New York Yankees 7-5 on an electric Wednesday night at Angel Stadium . But like so much of the team 's season , the good news was shrouded in bad : Starter Matt Shoemaker exited because of an arm injury .
Shoemaker 's fastball hummed from 92 to 94 mph in the first inning . After they took the mound for the second , their velocity dropped precipitously . Over the next three innings , they threw their fastball sparingly , and it averaged 89 mph and never surpassed 91 . Sudden velocity drops are common in the case of arm injuries .
Once the Yankees ' Gary Sanchez and Didi Gregorius notched back-to-back singles to begin the fourth , Angels athletic trainer Eric Munson visited the mound . They spoke to Shoemaker for about a minute before the two walked off together . The Angels later announced that Shoemaker experienced tightness in the extensor muscle of their right forearm . Forearm injuries are often connected to elbow injuries .
For Shoemaker , the night 's challenges began early . Brett Gardner began the game with a single to left field . They took third when Aaron Judge ripped a single to left , and scored when Matt Holliday boomed a sacrifice fly to the warning track in center field .
Next , Shoemaker drilled Starlin Castro in the left hand , eliciting a visit from pitching coach Charles Nagy . Sanchez , last year 's rookie sensation , came up and smashed a 441-foot , three-run blast to left field . Shoemaker held up their glove to receive a new ball before the previous one departed the ballpark , as they are wont to do . The Yankees led 4-0 and would n't score again while Shoemaker was on the mound .
The Angels began to chip away in the bottom of the inning . Cameron Maybin tapped an infield single to third base before Albert Pujols and Yunel Escobar rapped singles into the outfield . Up next , Luis Valbuena clobbered a ball to center , but Aaron Hicks reached over the wall and came down with it .
One run scored on the sacrifice fly , and two runs scored on Danny Espinosa 's second-inning homer . Yankees starter Michael Pineda threw them a first-pitch fastball down the middle , and Espinosa timed it to right field .
The Angels rallied for two more in the third . Pujols singled into left , took second on an Escobar groundout , third on a Valbuena groundout , and home on a wild pitch . Andrelton Simmons walked , went to second on that errant pitch , and scored when Eric Young Jr. poked a single into left .
The Angels replaced Shoemaker with right-hander Parker Bridwell , who was called up earlier in the day in Mike Morin 's stead . They quickly induced a grounder from Chase Headley that hit Gregorius in the legs , thus registering as an out . Next , Orange County native Rob Refsnyder lined a ball right to Espinosa , who stepped on second base to complete the inning-ending double play .
In the fifth , Bridwell quickly retired two Yankees before Escobar threw away Judge 's grounder hit their way , allowing the rookie to reach base . After a Holliday single , Castro knocked another single into left field . Young delivered an accurate throw to backup catcher Juan Graterol , who tagged out Judge . As they ran off the field , Young held up three fingers on their right hand , in honor of their late son , Eric Young III , who died just after their birth in January .
In the sixth , Bridwell found trouble . Sanchez dribbled a ball back to him , and they threw errantly to first base , putting Sanchez on second . With one out , Headley singled into center to score Sanchez and tie the game .
In the seventh , Bridwell found more difficulty , but escaped it thanks to Young . Gardner and Hicks singled in the infield . Judge stroked a sinking liner to left , where Young came in and slid to corral it . Holliday popped out , and right-hander Blake Parker entered to face Castro . They struck them out and handled the eighth inning without issue .
With closer Bud Norris unavailable after appearing in three straight games , David Hernandez pitched the ninth . The Angels celebrated victory before an umpire review found that Kole Calhoun 's apparently game-ending catch of Hicks ' drive to the right-field wall was invalid . The game went on , and Aaron Judge approached as the potential tying run .
They grounded out to third base , and the Angels ( 35-34 ) went over .500 for the first time in three weeks .

Sterling defends assault rifle tattoo
LONDON - Manchester City and England star Raheem Sterling has been forced to defend their new tattoo of an M16 assault rifle . Sterling posted a picture of themselves training with their England team-mates at St George 's Park , with a tattoo of an assault rifle on the winger 's right calf clearly visible . Lucy Cope , who founded Mothers Against Guns after their son Damian was shot dead outside a club in central London in July 2012 , said the ink was `` totally unacceptable '' . They told the Sun : `` We demand they have the tattoo lasered off or covered up with a different tattoo . If they refuse they should be dropped from the England team . He 's supposed to be a role model but chooses to glamorise guns . '' But Sterling , who helped City win the Premier League title in April , alluded to the tattoo having a `` deeper meaning '' .–AFP

A New York City Police ( NYPD ) officer stands outside Trump Tower , Monday . ( Reuters/Brendan McDermid )
( Bloomberg ) - President Donald Trump will return to their midtown Manhattan apartment for the first time since taking office , for a three-day visit likely to snarl traffic and draw protests .
The president , who left their Bedminster , New Jersey , golf course Monday morning for a quick trip to Washington , is to arrive at John F. Kennedy International Airport about 8:15 p.m. Monday night . After a 20-minute Marine One helicopter flight to a landing zone near Wall Street , their motorcade will whisk them to their triplex home at Trump Tower overlooking Fifth Avenue .
On Sunday , protesters marched from Columbus Circle through Times Square and then to Trump Tower , holding signs criticizing their response to the events in Charlottesville . Police temporarily shut down traffic on Fifth Avenue . More protests were being organized for Monday via social media .
Roads near Trump Tower will be closed during the visit . The New York Police Department said residents should expect shutdowns and delays in the area surrounding East 57th Street and Fifth Avenue until Trump departs , and is encouraging the use of mass transit .
Mayor Bill de Blasio ( Dem . ) , said New Yorkers should skirt the area .
“ The best thing is , if you can avoid that part of town , please stay away from that part of midtown , ” de Blasio said Sunday at the Dominican Day Parade .
The nighttime arrival should curb the impact on rush hour traffic — a major concern for Trump , who has said one reason he 's limited travel to their home city is the impact on commuters . Last week , Trump told reporters in Bedminster he 'd experienced how troublesome presidential visits were to the city .
“ During the time that I lived in Manhattan , whenever a president came in , it was very disruptive , and I think I 'm probably more disruptive than any of them , ” they said .
While the president 's “ working vacation ” this week will be their first time spending the night in New York since their inauguration , Trump has visited the city since taking office . In May , they hosted Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull aboard the Intrepid Sea , Air & Space Museum for diplomatic talks and a gala to commemorate the World War II alliance between the U.S. and Australia .
The president is expected to return Wednesday to Bedminster to finish their two-week vacation .
As the New York Rangers close out their disappointing season , it is easy to see that the squad hitting the ice is quite different than the one that had hoped could compete for a Stanley Cup back in October . Rick Nash , Michael Grabner , J.T . Miller , Nick Holden and former captain Ryan McDonagh are all gone .
Brendan Smith , who looked like a solid second-pair defenseman last year , played so horribly this season , that he 's now riding buses in the AHL Ondřej Pavelec came in to back up Henrik Lundqvist , but they injured their knee a few weeks back , and with the ascension of Alexandar Georgiev , it 's doubtful he 'll suit up for the team again .
A host of new faces are on the team now , but there are still some core guys on the team Ranger fans are used to . But as the Rangers continue to rebuild for the future , one can assume that Rangers management led by General Manager Jeff Gorton is not done making moves .
Ranger fans are still coming to grips seeing players like Nash and Miller in different uniforms , but they should be prepared to say goodbye to a few others . Here are the players most likely to be suiting up in new uniforms when the first puck drops later this fall .
The Castoffs
These four players are almost a lock to not be in New York next year .
As already mentioned , Pavelec was brought in as a reclamation project on a one year deal , and while they are n't a liability , they also made people miss the days the team had guys like Cam Talbot and Antti Raanta backing up the King . Georgiev looks like the real deal so far in their first NHL games giving the Rangers no incentive to bring Pavelec back , considering Igor Shestyorkin is also due to arrive in just a few seasons .
David Desharnais came here on a prove-it one-year contract to serve as the Rangers third or fourth line center . They have not been flashy , but been a serviceable member of the team . But with Lias Andersson and Filip Chytil looking to make the jump next year , the Rangers will no longer need him .
Two other players who will not be with the Broadway Blueshirts are Paul Carey and Cody McLeod . For these two , both players may not even make an NHL roster next year and were merely spare parts the Rangers will no longer need with a host of prospects coming up .
Kevin Hayes , the Inconsistent Center
Other than the players listed above , perhaps there is no forward more likely to move on than Kevin Hayes . The four-year veteran has had steady statistics through their career , but anyone watches Hayes play will tell you the only thing consistent about their game is how inconsistent they are . One week , Hayes looks like Patrice Bergeron – being able to shut down a first line center while putting up solid offensive numbers . The next week , Hayes looks like a guy with a 12-pound bag of sand anchored to their skates who should n't even be dressing .
It 's reasons like this why Hayes , who will turn 26 in May , could very well be on another club in 2018-19 . Ultimately , they have failed to put up 50 points in any season . Some will argue that letting Hayes walk or trading them after re-signing them would scare off future NCAA free agents . But after four years , that sort of statute of limitations should no longer be a concern .
Hayes may be the most likely core player to leave , but there are two more beloved Rangers who may also face an uncertain future as well .
Chris Kreider , the Enigma
If you needed to add a photo next to the word enigma , Chris Kreider would be a perfect fit . One night they make a pass like they did against the St. Louis Blues where they channeled their inner Adam Oates . There are other times where Kreider can single-handedly take over a game in a way only a few elite players can do in the NHL . Then they will disappear for the next 12 games and at times look like their night was disturbed by having to appear at a hockey game .
Kreider is one of these players where people keep waiting to see them put it all together , but all of a sudden , we realize they are already past their prime . And at this point , just a month before their 27th birthday , we may be reaching that point with Kreider and that is a shame . It is clear the guy has shown flashes of talent where they could be a 40 goal scorer will never likely reach that level . This is why for a team that is rebuilding and ushering in a new generation , they may be the type of player that gets moved .
Beyond the reasons listed above , Kreider also makes a great example of a player that a general manager on another team will convince themselves that they can bring out Kreider 's full potential and groom a future All-Star .
Of every veteran player left on the Rangers roster , Kreider would likely yield the biggest return . It would not be out of the question that Kreider could fetch a first round pick and some nice prospects , especially if you consider Rick Nash , who is now considerably older and seeing their skills depreciate brought back that sort of haul when they were traded to Boston last month .
Mats Zuccarello , the Fan Favorite
This one is heartbreaking for every Ranger fan to even think about . You can make a strong argument that Zuccarello is the most beloved Rangers player since Adam Graves . After all , they have won the Steven McDonald Extra Effort Award as voted on by the fans in three of the past four years ( and is the odds-on favorite to win this year as well ) . The only other players to win this award three times are Graves and Ryan Callahan .
Fans should take notice what happened to those other fan favorites . Most fans will recall Callahan being traded in 2013-14 to the Tampa Bay Lightning for Martin St. Louis . And while Graves has remained a big part of the Rangers franchise through their charitable work and frequent alumni appearances , many people do not recall that even they were traded to the San Jose Sharks in 2001 . So while the idea of seeing “ Hobbit ” playing in another jersey is painful to think about , it is ultimately a business .
Zuccarello may still look like a teenager with a face that does n't seem to age , but they turn 31 later this year and will enter the final year of their contract in 2018-19 . There have been many stories written about their close relationships to players like Carl Hagelin , Erik Karlsson and Derek Brassard , so if it does not look like the Rangers are close to contending , you have to consider the possibility they could go to a team like Pittsburgh where they would likely be a perfect fit .
That is why the Rangers have to consider dealing them if they determine that they are unlikely to stay with the team after next year . In fact , if the Rangers are unable to reach some sort of extension with them this summer , I would argue they should be dealt during the offseason .
Seeing players you cheer for blossom from young prospect to veteran stud is never an easy thing . But for a team like the Rangers that is making it known they 're about to kick off a new generation of Rangers hockey next year , fans must embrace themselves for more change this summer .
Authorities arrested two teenagers after a man was repeatedly stabbed during a fight in the parking lot of a church in Palmdale .
Sheriff 's officials say the 21-year-old victim was hospitalized in stable condition with at least 10 stab wounds after collapsing late Thursday .
A witness told investigators the man had fought with a group of people and the attackers fled in multiple vehicles .
Officials said that a short time later , deputies took two male suspects , 17 and 18 years old , into custody .
The investigation is ongoing .
`` There 's still the belief [ among recipients ] that maybe this is over , so they ca n't renew , '' Cabrera said . `` It might be an issue of money . It may be that folks are losing faith in the system . So one more broken promise by this administration , and a number of young people may not want to renew . ''
The outgoing CEO of the Jewish Federation of Greater Washington , Steven Rakitt , was praised last week for putting the local Jewish community “ on the path of inclusiveness . ”
Rakitt , 61 , who is leaving the Federation after six years to become president of the Genesis Prize Foundation in August , lost their hearing at age 2 . Speakers at the Federation 's annual meeting , held June 7 at B'nai Israel Congregation in Rockville , connected their disability to their drive to make the Jewish community — and particularly the Federation as a microcosm of that community — welcoming to those with disabilities , as well as others who might easily be shunted aside .
Federation donor Larry Nussdorf told the 200 people gathered that they and their wife , Melanie , became involved with the umbrella organization during Rakitt 's tenure “ because they pushed the community toward inclusion . ”
“ His commitment to the Jewish community including and welcoming difference has been a priority , ” echoed Liza Levy , incoming co-president . Inclusion is a “ mindset , in the language we use and the actions we take . ”
Because of Rakitt , the Federation now adds an “ inclusive ” statement on its invitations and its videos are closed captioned , they said . In addition , the Federation under Rakitt provided funding for the first Gallaudet University Birthright trip , bringing students with hearing impairments to Israel .
“ Thanks to you , Steve , inclusion is woven into the fabric of our Jewish community , ” Levy said .
When the Federation opened its new building in 2014 , Café Sunflower , with its staff of people with intellectual disabilities , opened right off the lobby .
The café 's prominent location “ shows our Jewish community needs to be welcoming and inclusive , ” said Ron Halber , executive director of the Jewish Community Relations Council of Greater Washington , who called the new building “ crisp and vibrant . ”
Rakitt was involved in the Federation 's branding effort , which produced the “ Make It Yours ” slogan , with its intent of welcoming local Jews “ to be themselves and bring it to Federation , ” said Jeff Rum , Federation 's vice president for marketing .
Dottie Bennett , a Federation volunteer , said there are now many ways to enter the Jewish community , and pointed as an example to P.J . library , the free children 's book program , which began in Washington five years ago with a grant from Federation 's United Jewish Endowment Fund .
Rakitt 's attention to Northern Virginia was “ a first ” said Bennett . “ He was at every meeting , every gala . They were always there . ”
Other innovations during Rakitt 's tenure include the Israel Your Way mission , the Sara and Samuel J. Lessans Good Deeds Day , the Imagine Israel initiative , and a $ 250,000 investment to bring Israeli emissaries , or shlichim , to local congregations “ to develop personal relationships and share contemporary culture . ”
As they closed the meeting , Rakitt offered a list of “ everyone ” who “ must be included ” in the Jewish community : the disabled , newcomers , LGBTQ people , teens and families .
“ All are waiting to be welcomed in , ” they said .
At the meeting , Rabbi Fred Scherlinder Dobb of Adat Shalom Reconstructionist Congregation in Potomac received the Rabbi Matthew H. Simon Rabbinical Award . Benjamin Milakofsky won the Jerome J. Dick Young Leadership Award . Carol Croll and Elinor Ginzler received the Ted B. Farber Professional Excellence Award . And Jeff Distenfeld won the Jack Kay Campaigner of the Year Award .

A 51 year old man has been charged with murder following the death of a man at The Beacon in Catterick Garrison .
The victim can now be identified as 34 year old Craig Guy , who was a resident at The Beacon .
Craig was found at the property with fatal injuries at 11.30pm on Thursday 13 April 2017 .
The 51 year old man will appear at Court on Monday 17 April 2017 .
Kristen Anderson-Lopez and Robert Lopez were watching the Golden Globe nominations Monday morning when news hit of a pipe bomb explosion in Manhattan . Then , after they were nominated in the original song category for “ Remember Me ” from the animated feature “ Coco , ” the wife and husband took their 11-month-old kitten , Finn McCool , to the veterinarian to have them put down . They were dying of a terminal illness .
“ So , it 's been a day , ” Anderson-Lopez said by phone from New York .
The songwriters are not strangers to awards season , having won an Oscar for their “ Frozen ” anthem “ Let It Go. ” But they said getting nominated is never anything you expect , or get used to .
“ It 's such a cliché , but just being nominated is such a huge honor , ” said Anderson-Lopez , adding that now they have to figure out what to wear to the big party in Los Angeles . “ We 've been in writing mode , with all of the eating and drinking involved . ”
“ Coco ” and “ Remember Me ” were a long time coming . Lopez remembered that when they were first pitched on the project , the story brought tears to their eyes . They dove deep into researching the vision of creator and co-director Lee Unkrich , including themes revolving around Dia de los Muertos . Two years passed before they put pen to paper .
“ It was so inspiring , and the way they 've realized it is so marvelous , ” Lopez said of the film . “ We 're so grateful and blessed to be a part of this project . ”
When they finally did start writing the song , Anderson-Lopez remembered their husband coming up with the melody while noodling on the piano in their pajamas one morning . They recorded it on their iPhone and listened to it over and over again until the lyrics came to them on the subway .
The couple always test their songs on their children , ages 8 and 12 . “ Remember Me ” went over big .
“ They are our little focus group , ” Lopez said .
Tonight the family plans to celebrate — and decompress — by seeing “ Star Wars : The Last Jedi . ”
“ Talk about highs and lows , ” Anderson-Lopez said .

Chennai : Of the 29 pilgrims from Tamil Nadu , who had embarked on a pilgrimage to Kailash Mansarovar Yatra in Tibetan region of China , one has died of ill health , Chief Minister K Palaniswami said on Wednesday . Over 1,500 Indian pilgrims , undertaking the yatra , have been stranded in a mountainous region in Nepal near Tibet due to inclement weather and India has sought assistance from Kathmandu to evacuate them .
The chief minister said a team of 18 Chennai people had arrived from Nepal in Lucknow this morning , while one more is yet to reach that city . All of them were expected to reach Chennai on Wednesday night , Palaniswami informed the state Assembly . Four persons from Krishnagiri and six others from Theni had also gone on pilgrimage , they said in response to a query raised by Leader of Opposition MK Stalin .
The chief minister said a 69-year-old man identified as Ramachandran could not complete their journey and upon return died owing to breathlessness . Their body was kept in a Kathmandu hospital and the deceased 's family members have flown to Nepal .
Officials at the Tamil Nadu House in New Delhi were coordinating with the Indian Embassy in Kathmandu to bring back the mortal remains of Ramachandran on Wednesday or Thursday , they said . Similarly , efforts were on to ensure the safe return of the four-member team from Krishnagiri to Nepalgunj , bordering India , they added . Palaniswami further said soon after it came to be known that pilgrims from Tamil Nadu were stranded in Nepal due to bad weather , they had deputed two officials from Tamil Nadu House to coordinate the rescue efforts and ensure the safe return of those stranded .
The pilgrimage to Kailash Mansarovar is considered holy by Hindus , Buddhists and Jains . Every year , hundreds of Indians undertake the 'yatra ' which involves trekking under inhospitable conditions . The Tamil Nadu government had on Tuesday announced setting up of a control room in New Delhi to provide logistic support for the state pilgrims stranded in Nepal due to inclement weather once they arrive in the national capital . The control room , manned by five officials , will be functioning in the Tamil Nadu House and can be reached at 011-21610285 and 011-21610286 , an official release said .
LAHORE : In less than 48 hours , Punjab Food Authority confiscated huge pile of fake ketchup packets from two different factories that were manufacturing the ketchup using chemicals and without pulp .
On Wednesday PFA seized 10,000 litres fake ketchup packets from Ajwa Foods Ketchup production unit located at residential area of Samanabad .
It is the second time that such a huge amount of fake and substandard Ketchups are confiscated in less than two days . PFA director operations Rafia Haider said that on information provided by the PFA vigilance cell raided the factory and upon finding the sub standard and mosaic of fake colours , chemicals were being used in manufacturing in ketchups .
The ketchup production unit was operational in residential area of Samanabad . The surging trend of establishing commercial businesses in residential areas itself is an eye opener and this case alone revealed the fact that authorities concerned are not fulfilling their due role .
Ketchup is an essential item used with fries , pizza , beans on toast , sausage sandwiches , and is served at almost every food outlet in the city of foodies , Lahore .
Adding insult to injury when PFA teams raided the factory the raw material was being shifted into the dirty blue drums keeping no safety and health measures taken and exposed to flies in an open environment . The sample test of Ketchup was unsatisfactory as per reports and on the initial information of vigilance cell the factory was traced and sealed .
Prior to this , PFA on Sunday carried out a raid at a ketchup factory - Punjab Foods Products - and disposed off 8,000 litres of substandard ketchup at Madinah Park near Ruhi Nullah .
The factory , which was operational since 2010 , was operating under unhygienic conditions . During the raid , the PFA team found out that the most essential item of the ketchup - tomato - was not being used for the preparation but the chemicals and starch .
An FIR was lodged against the factory owner and they were arrested from the spot . The PFA teams also disposed off all the substandard ketchup on the spot .
During last few years , few factories in Lahore were sealed over the usage of the rotten tomatoes to make ketchup but the ketchup production unit that was sealed on Sunday was using chemical only .
PFA Director ( Operations ) Rafia Haider said that PFA teams raided the ketchup production cell on information of vigilance cell . The ketchup production unit was involved in also labeling different brands names on substandard ketchup packets , they told the media .
They vowed to continue the crackdown against the mafia that has been playing with the lives of citizens to make profit .
Last week was itself an eye opener for citizens of Lahore as 1.1 million rotten eggs worth Rs15 million confiscated and disposed off from the spot . PFA spokesperson told The Nation with new system introduced by PFA we are vigilantly checking the food industries and no one will be allowed to loot or deceive the citizens .

With recent changes , Flipboard has been placing a big emphasis on allowing readers to go deep on their interests . Now it 's adding even more features around one particular interest , in the Technology section of the Flipboard website and app .
“ We want to make Flipboard definitive for tech insiders and enthusiasts , ” said CEO Mike McCue .
This positions Flipboard as more of a direct competitor to a tech news aggregator like Techmeme , but with more curation from partners and from readers themselves .
The most immediately noticeable change is what the company describes as a “ newspaper-like , high-density layout. ” Basically , it moves away from the image-heavy look that Flipboard is known for , towards a layout that places a bigger emphasis on headlines and text , designed for quick scanning .
While McCue said the new look is “ really meant for the desktop , ” Flipboard has also created a version for the mobile web , and the app will also vary between a high-density and low-density layout depending on the stories . ( If it seems strange for Flipboard to be prioritizing its web experience , remember that the company has also been shifting its focus away from its own native article formats towards the mobile web . )
Regardless of which layout you 're seeing , the section will also have new content . Some of it will be curated by Flipboard publishers , with The Verge creating roundups for Gadgets News and Artificial Intelligence , the Wirecutter offering Deals of the Week and the team here at TechCrunch curating our latest Features .
“ Flipboard has really become more of an ecosystem , ” McCue said . “ Publishers and curators are curating stories around all sorts of different topics . We want to provide access to that ecosystem on any platform , with or without the app . ”
Teams can also create their own magazines , which are basically private collections of stories . So if you 're at a startup and want all of your colleagues to be up-to-date on the latest headlines about your industry and competitors , you can curate a magazine that 's only visible to them .
Flipboard will also be asking experts and influencers for book recommendations , starting with Wired Editor-in-Chief Nick Thompson 's roundup of “ Five Books I 've Recently Read About the Future . ”
And all of this will be rounded up in a daily email , which will include the latest tech headlines as well as selections from any team magazine you contribute to . On Saturday , the newsletter will focus on those book recommendations , with links to buy the titles on Amazon .
McCue suggested that if all this new content is embraced by readers , we might see Flipboard start to pursue a similar strategy around other topics , with a focus on reaching professional readers . Next up : Advertising .
Android app permissions can be scary . They 're often vague and too broad , and there are more than a few times we 've seen developers try to abuse them . But , thankfully , they are all under your control . Starting with Marshmallow , Android has settings to control individual permissions for every application . That does n't mean every app in Google Play allows you to set each permission individually , though , because plenty of developers are n't targeting their apps to Android 6 or higher . Those apps still give you a list of permissions when you install them , and you have two choices — say yes to all , or do n't install the app . Google is slowly forcing developers to move their apps to use more current features , like granular permissions , so this will eventually stop being a thing . More : What those scary app permissions mean We 're not talking about those apps here . When you run across them , just try to look at each permission and see why the app might want it . In any case , Google scans each app when it 's installed ( whether it comes from Google Play or not ) so it will kill anything fishy . For the rest of the apps that do follow guidelines and are compatible with the granular permission model ( which is most these days ) , you can decide if you want it to have access to each thing individually . So what happens if you say no ? Well , that depends on why the app wants that particular permission . Let 's look at the YouTube app as an example . There are two ways to see an app 's permissions — you can see what an app requests under its listing , or you can look at a permission and see what apps are using or requesting it . Both can be useful , but for our purposes , we 're going to look at the YouTube app listing . Finding an app 's permissions
Open your device Settings , find the entry for Applications , and tap it .
, find the entry for , and tap it . You 'll see your recently opened apps at the top of the page followed by a link to see All of your apps . Tap that if you do n't see the app you 're looking for in the list .
. Tap that if you do n't see the app you 're looking for in the list . Scroll through the list and find the YouTube app ( or whatever app you 're looking for ) and tap its listing .
app ( or whatever app you 're looking for ) and tap its listing . In the center of the new window is a listing for Permissions . Tap it . A new page will open that lists every permission the app is using or would want to use . The switch beside each line shows if the permission is enabled or not — it will be colorized and moved to the right if it is enabled . In the YouTube app , you see a lot of permissions that do n't directly relate to streaming a video , at least on the surface . But they really are all needed if you use every feature of the YouTube app . It needs what ? Why ?
Camera , for example , is needed if you want to live stream something using your phone . If you try it , you 'll be asked to enable permission for the camera and Microphone . Contacts , SMS , and Phone are there because you can share a video with anyone in your address book , and looking inside the address book exposes all that information . Storage is there in case you want to download and save a video or a movie for its rental period . Location is required if you run across any video that 's restricted by region as well as for checking DRM licenses . It 's not always clear why an app needs permission to do something , but denying that permission wo n't break anything . You can watch a video on YouTube without granting any permission ( though some phones will require the Storage permission be enabled to stream video ) , but not every video . YouTube allows content to be uploaded that is age restricted , and maybe you 've run across that sort of content while you 're not signed in to YouTube ; in that case , it blocks access until you sign in and you 're verified as an adult according to the laws where you live . Notice the where you live part , because that 's very important . Content guidelines and age-restriction varies from place to place , so YouTube needs to know where you are in certain cases . There are also videos that are n't accessible in certain countries , such as war footage that uses symbols banned in Germany . To see these , YouTube has to know where you are so it knows if it can stream them to you . And when you rent or buy a video and want to watch it on YouTube , the digital license needs to be checked to make sure it is valid where you are — not all DRM licensing is world-wide . With Location permissions turned off , you 'll not be able to play any restricted content videos or some purchased or rented videos . YouTube will ask you to enable Location when this happens , and if you do n't allow it the video will not be played . Other videos will continue to work and until you come across another piece of content that needs to know where you are before it can be streamed , everything will work normally .
Most other apps that have streaming video , like Facebook or Twitter , work that same way here . They want permission to check your location to show you a video to stay out of trouble . Unfortunately , granting location permissions also means the app can gather information about where you go and when . Permissions can cover a thing you want as well as something you do n't — like location tracking — at the same time . That 's how all permissions for Android apps work . An app will ask for permission when it needs something it ca n't access without it , and if you choose to refuse , that part of the app will not work . This can have little effect on the rest of the app , or it can be show-stopping and the app wo n't work . That depends on what the app is trying to do when it needs permission . Let 's pretend we live in a country that requires you to be an adult to watch any video on YouTube ; nothing will work with Location permissions denied . Should I deny permissions then ? Yep ! Any time you feel like you do n't want an app doing something it wants to do , just say no . The very worst thing that can happen is the app crashes and closes , but it will start right back up if you want it to . If an app wants a permission you 're not sure you should be granting , ask the developer why . You 'll find their contact information at the bottom of the app 's Play Store listing , and that is why it 's there .
It 's easy to just say no and see what effect that has . Try it next time you are leery about why an app needs something .
ISLAMABAD , Oct 6 ( APP ) : President Mamnoon Hussain Friday said universities and other educational institutions had an additional responsibility of human resource development , to strengthen the country 's socio-economic structure .
The President was talking to Chancellor of Riphah
International University Hasan Muhammad Khan and Vice
Chancellor Professor Dr. Anis Ahmad , here at the Aiwan-e-Sadr .
The President expressed satisfaction over the improved
standards of higher education in Pakistan during last few
years . They said institutions like Riphah International
University had played a commendable role in this regard .
They said still a lot needed to be done to come at par
with international standards of higher education , adding that
the government was taking all possible measures for promotion of education .
The President stressed secondary and higher education
for women , that comprised half of the country 's population .
They appreciated the establishment of Women Institute of
Science and Humanities at Riphah International University and said such dedicated campuses for women were a significant development in providing them quality education .
Chancellor Hasan Muhammad Khan briefed the President
about ongoing and future projects of the university .
They also extended an invitation to the President to
inaugurate a charity hospital established by the university .
Around 10:30 p.m. on Oct. 1 , Stephen Zimmerman , a reserve center on the Lakers ' training camp roster , checked in with their friends from back home to make sure everyone was OK .
Zimmerman spent their formative years living in Las Vegas , from ages 10 to 20 . They went to bed that night , like so many did , not expecting the historic tragedy that unfolded later when a gunman killed 58 people from windows in a 32nd floor suite at Mandalay Bay and injured more than 500 others during a music festival .
“ That 's something that 's going to affect Las Vegas forever , ” Zimmerman said .
On Saturday the Lakers will travel to Las Vegas for their Sunday game against the Sacramento Kings . The Lakers , Kings , T-Mobile Arena , and AEG and MGM Resorts International , which own and operate T-Mobile Arena , will donate the proceeds of the game to benefit victims of the shooting , their families and first responders .
The game will be a homecoming for Zimmerman , whose family will be there , but he 'll make this trip with a heavier heart after what their hometown has been through .
“ It hurts , ” Zimmerman said . “ It feels way more personal . It 's one of those things that 's like , you never know how it feels until it happens to you and it feels like it happened to me . It 's kind of hard to describe . ”
Zimmerman was lucky . Although they had some friends who did attend the concert , they were safe . They watched their videos on social media , and felt the fear they experienced . One close friend 's parents and aunts and uncles were there , but they left before the horror began .
In the few spare moments they had after waking up and before going to practice , Zimmerman and their girlfriend , who was born and raised in Las Vegas , talked about what happened . They talked about how they could help . They were pleased to hear the Lakers ' commitment of the game 's proceeds .
“ Anything I can help [ with ] , ” Zimmerman said . “ Luckily , Las Vegas was helpful . We had three-hour lines for blood drives and a whole bunch of stuff going on . Just seeing what I can do . ”
Ball limited in practice
Lakers point guard Lonzo Ball was limited in practice on Friday with a sprained ankle . The team has listed them as questionable for Sunday 's game against the Kings .
“ It 's getting better every day , still day-to-day , got out there today , tried to practice a little bit , but I was limited , ” Ball said . “ But try to take positives , and like I said , just try to get better every day . ”
Ball suffered the left ankle sprain that the Lakers called mild during Monday 's preseason game at Staples Center . They missed Wednesday 's game in Ontario , the closest Lakers game of the season to their hometown of Chino Hills .
As practice closed on Friday , Ball was sitting on the side of the practice court with their foot elevated as they received treatment for the injury .
“ We would love to have them out there obviously , ” Lakers Coach Luke Walton said . “ But … if they are not ready to go then they wo n't play . ”
Lakers forward Brandon Ingram took on some of the point guard duties in Ball 's absence . Ingram , who missed Wednesday 's game with a head contusion , is probable for Sunday .
Lakers center Andrew Bogut is questionable with a groin injury .
New analytics boss
The Lakers hired Jason Rosenfeld , previously with the NBA , as their director of basketball analytics .
Rosenfeld helped develop new statistics to track player production while working in the league office .
Rosenfeld has also been the Charlotte Hornets director of basketball analytics and they worked in the front office of the Shanghai Sharks , owned by Yao Ming , from 2009 to 2010 .

That India is an important market for Xiaomi is a foregone conclusion . But if the latest regulatory filings made by the Chinese consumer electronics giant are any indication , then it will seem that Xiaomi does not only want to sell smartphones in India .
According to a report in The Economic Times , Xiaomi in its regulatory filing with the Registrar of Companies ( RoC ) in India has mentioned its expansion plans . This expansion roadmap includes plans to sell more consumer electronic products apart from smartphones , electric vehicles and its components as well as entering the payments bank sector .
Xiaomi has stated that it can potentially `` sell all types of vehicles for transport , conveyance and other transport equipment , whether based on electricity or any other motive or mechanical power , including the components , spare parts . ''
Apart from this , Xiaomi has also expressed a keen interest in offering payments bank-related services . These include leasing and financing , payment gateways , settlement system operators , mobile virtual network operators among other things .
Xiaomi sells a boatload of products across categories in China . This can go from a smart pen to a notebook to personal care products and much more . Xiaomi already has a foldable electric bike called the Mi QiCycle as well as electric scooters selling in China . Rumours of it launching an electric car have been doing the rounds of online forums for quite a while now .
According to ET , Xiaomi is also keen on selling consumer electronics goods such as laptops , gaming consoles , computer accessories , lifestyle products and network equipment in India . It is willing to sell these products online as well as via offline channels in India .
Speaking to ET , one Xiaomi India spokesperson said that the company 's regulatory filing does not indicate that all the new products will be coming to India soon .
`` We have expressed our interest to bring several of our non-smartphone products to India multiple times , but only after ensuring that we have picked the right product and customised it to India 's needs , '' said the spokesperson .
Xiaomi has been on the fence for years now when it comes to getting some of its popular products such as the Mi TV to India . Since its launch , Xiaomi has diversified into selling audio products , smart devices such as fitness bands , air purifier , routers , power banks and accessories such as selfie sticks , Bluetooth speakers , flip covers , VR headsets and so on in India . It is only natural that it is looking to expand its India portfolio , now that it has got the smartphone market right .
The regulatory filing needs to be seen in the light of Xiaomi 's dream of going public . Xiaomi is getting ready for an initial public offering ( IPO ) next year , at a valuation beyond $ 50 billion .
GRATIS — The Village of Gratis Volunteer Fire Department is honoring Fire Prevention Week by hosting an Open House on Oct. 9 from 6-9 p.m. at the Gratis Fire Department . The event will feature activities and displays intended to inform the public about fire safety .
Fire Prevention Week is Oct. 8-14 and is dedicated to learning what to do in case of a fire . This year 's Fire Prevention Week is theme , “ Every Second Counts : Plan 2 Ways Out ! ”
“ Developing and practicing a home escape plan is like building muscle memory , ” said Chris Allen , Assistant Chief of the Gratis Volunteer Fire Department . “ That pre-planning is what everyone will draw upon to snap into action and escape as quickly as possible in the event of a fire . ”
The theme is intended to better educate the public about the critical importance of developing a home escape plan and practicing it . The Gratis Volunteer Fire Department is working in coordination with the National Fire Protection Association ( NFPA ) , the official sponsor of the Fire Prevention Week for more than 90 years , to reinforce those potentially life-saving messages .
“ Home escape planning is one of the most basic but fundamental elements of home fire safety , and can truly make the difference between life and death in a fire situation , ” said Lorraine Carli , NFPA 's vice president of Outreach and Advocacy .
In support of Fire Prevention Week , Fire Chief Jeff King encourages all Gratis households to develop a plan together and practice it . A home escape plan includes working smoke alarms on every level of the home , in every bedroom , and near all sleeping areas . It also includes two ways out of every room , usually a door and a window , with a clear path to an outside meeting place ( like a tree , light pole , or mailbox ) that 's a safe distance from the home .
NFPA and the Gratis Volunteer Fire Department offer these additional tips and recommendations for developing and practicing a home escape plan :
•Draw a map of your home with all members of your household , marking two exits from each room and a path to the outside from each exit .
•Practice your home fire drill twice a year . Conduct one at night and one during the day with everyone in your home , and practice using different ways out .
•Teach children how to escape on their own in case you ca n't help them .
•Make sure the number of your home is clearly marked and easy for the fire department to find .
•Close doors behind you as you leave — this may slow the spread of smoke , heat , and fire .
•Once you get outside , stay outside . Never go back inside a burning building .

Friday morning , three-year-old Everette Wertman and their family visited the Humanitarian Village at Marina Green . The village showcases what the military can do in a disaster situation .

Two weeks ago , senior leadership at Minot Air Force Base , North Dakota , coordinated with Department of Defense civilian personnel to provide four Transition Assistance Program seminars for federal employees .
The TAP , originally created and mandatory for military members separating from active duty to attend , provides information and training to ensure those transitioning from federal employment are prepared for their future .
“ The 5th Force Support Squadron wanted to offer a very friendly way for civilians to transfer into retirement , so we were very appreciative that the bomb wing commander could support the request for the training , ” said Suong Willson , 5th FSS civilian personnel officer .
A total of 148 Minot AFB DOD civilians attended the retirement seminars .
“ The training provided employees with a 360 degree view of the retirement process and how to prepare for that day , ” said Joan Beardsley , 5th FSS human resource specialist .
Three sessions were made for employees who are eligible to retire within the next five years ; 114 total civilians attended these sessions . One session was made for employees who are eligible to retire after five years ; 34 total civilians attended this session .
“ Our feedback for all TAP sessions was very positive , ” said Willson . “ I still have 12 years left and I learned a lot . Now I can make certain choices and know that in 10 years , I will benefit from it . ”
The last retirement class at Minot AFB was over eight years ago . Since then , it was no longer funded due to other available online resources .
“ After our civilians serve honorably for 30 plus years , the last thing we want is to tell them to go online or call 1-800-who-cares , ” said Willson .
“ The online program does n't provide the personal touch or Q-and-A sessions that someone may need to ensure they are set for retirement . ”
A great turnout and positive feedback has influenced the idea of continuing civilian retirement training .
“ I would recommend this training to anyone and hope that this training will be offered every year or every other year , ” said Beardsley .

The Director of Public Prosecutions ( DPP ) Evelina Baptiste has filed a notice of “ discontinuance ” in a matter dealing with Lindon St. Louis of Castle Bruce .
St. Louis was charged with “ causing death by dangerous driving ” in an incident which took place in August 2013 at Good Hope .
According to court papers , they did cause the death of Corrine Francis by driving motor vehicle registration number TE275 in a manner which was dangerous to the public having regards to all the circumstances of the case including the nature , condition and use of the road and the amount of traffic that is reasonably be expected to be on the road at the time .
In a police report given in 2013 , Francis , who was speech and hearing impaired , was crossing a street at Good Hope when they were struck by a dump truck driven by St. Louis . They were pronounced dead at the Princess Margaret Hospital .
Since the incident , they maintained that they were “ not guilty ” and had not driven dangerously on the road .
In their defense statement to the police , they said in part , “ I looked in the road , up and down and there was no traffic at that time . It is a quiet area , there were no pedestrians on the road , and the deceased was not on the road . I guided the truck down the road as it was clear of any obstruction and pedestrian . The deceased came onto the road from nowhere and crossed the road into the path of the truck . I took positive action to avoid a collision with the deceased by running the truck into a parked bus on the left side of the road . They did not respond to the massive noise of the accident with the bus nor did they look back . They walked back into the middle of the road and collided with the truck . I was not driving recklessly . ”
Tiyani Behanzin , the lawyer for St. Louis , had petitioned the court for the medical history of the deceased at the Princess Margaret Hospital ( PMH ) and the local health district that covers Castle Bruce . Their information was that the deceased as “ deaf and dumb ” and suffering from epilepsy .
The autopsy report from the pathologist stated that the thorax and abdomen were the areas mainly affected and there was a great loss of blood from both lungs , the liver and spleen which caused “ haemoragic shock which I concluded as being the cause of death . ”
Behazin described their client as “ a quiet man who has been traumatized by the incident . ”
“ He has been very distraught about the entire incident since it happened in 2013 , this is just unfortunate and it has ruined their life , ” Behanzin said .
According to him , while a life has been lost , the circumstances surrounding the accident are not “ negligent ” on their client and they ought not to have been charged .
They said they were happy that common sense prevailed that the DPP discontinued the matter , making St. Louis a free man .

`` If they [ Ibrahimovic ] changes their mind , contacts me and tells me ‘ yes , I want to be part of it , ' then we 'll sit down and discuss what that would mean , how we play these days and so on , '' Andersson told Kicker .
“ But that 's all speculation . I do n't know [ if he 'd still fit into the team ] . But I also do n't think about it . I take the things as they come if they come .
`` If you want to be part of it , you must call me . Easy as that . ”
Ariel Winter has deleted their Twitter account .
The 'Modern Family ' star says they have made the decision to `` delete all social media '' and has already started the process of wiping their online pages .
They told fans about their plans using the Instagram Story function but at the time of writing , their Instagram account is still active but when an attempt is made to access their Twitter account , the message `` Sorry , that page does n't exist ! '' is displayed .
Ariel 's decision comes only a few months after they admitted they want to take a break from the spotlight .
They explained : `` One day you did something great , and the next day you 're like plastered as a thousand other things . It 's a really difficult industry ... I mean , we 're blessed to be in [ it ] , and be able to make content that we love and that other people love , but it 's also an industry . It is true . it builds you up , and it can tear you down just as fast ...
`` Having every little aspect of your life in the public eye , it 's really hard , because it gives more room for criticism , and I just want to live . So I think I try and stay out of it as much as possible , unless I need to be in it . I do n't really go anywhere to be seen or anything like that . I 'll go to a red carpet , if I 'm in [ the movie ] , or if I 'm supporting my boyfriend or my friends . But otherwise I usually just stay home . ''
LONDON ( Reuters ) - Tearful Johannes Vetter made up for just missing out on an Olympic medal last year when the German won the javelin at the World Athletics Championships on Saturday as their great rival and Olympic champion Thomas Roehler finished off the podium .
Czech Republic pair Jakub Vadlejch , coached by world record holder Jan Zelezny , and Petr Frydrych threw personal bests of 89.73 and 88.32 metres respectively to take silver and bronze .
Vetter 's opening throw of 89.89 was enough to win the gold and the 24-year-old was overcome with emotion after clinching the title which was confirmed after Vadlejch 's last throw .
Roehler , who like compatriot Vetter has thrown over 90 metres this season , was beaten into fourth with 88.26 .
`` I was shaking until my last attempt because I had used all of my energy in the first two throws , '' said Vetter who was fourth at the Rio de Janeiro Games .
`` Technically they were not perfect . I thought I could throw further . It does not matter how far you throw . I threw enough for a gold medal . ''
`` It was very emotional for me at the end of the competition because of the pressure in the last few weeks and days -- it was very high . ''
Roehler and Vetter have sustained an impressive rivalry this season with Roehler winning six of their 10 meetings before London .
Roehler began the season in Doha with the second longest throw in history of 93.90 until they were overhauled by Vetter 's 94.44 metre effort in Lucerne on July 11 .
With Andreas Hoffman also in form , Germany even had hopes of a first-ever javelin clean sweep at the World Championships , but the Czech pair had other ideas .
Vadlejch threw 89.73 with their second attempt , while Frydrych left their best for last as they pipped Roehler to the bronze with their sixth throw .
`` When my coach Jan Zelezny saw the throws , they were not satisfied and saw many mistakes in it , '' said Vadlejch . `` It was not the worst but you can always go further . The main thing is that I managed to improve my personal best . ''
`` I was dreaming about this medal but now , it is a mixed feeling . Happiness mixed with a bitter feeling that there were these 16 centimetres missing for gold . ''
BERLIN ( Reuters ) - Bottom-of-the-table Cologne 's dismal season took another twist on Sunday when they blew a three-goal lead to lose 4-3 at home to fellow strugglers Freiburg and remain winless after 15 games in the Bundesliga .

In a game that began half an hour late for snow to be cleared from the pitch , Nils Petersen scored two penalties in the final minutes to complete a hat-trick and win the match for the visitors , who began the day one place above their opponents .
Cologne , in their first league game under caretaker coach Stefan Ruthenbeck after Peter Stoeger was fired a week ago , looked certain to pick up their first league win of the season as they raced to a 3-0 lead in less than half an hour .
“ What happened today was very painful , ” said Ruthenbeck . “ We began well and did everything right early on . But after halftime the game was turned on its head . ”
Lukas Kluenter sidefooted home from Milos Jojic 's pass to put them ahead , Sehrou Guirassy won and converted a penalty and Caleb Stanko turned Konstantin Rausch 's cross into their own goal .
It began to go wrong for the Billy Goats when Petersen volleyed one back five minutes before halftime and the tension was palpable after Janik Haberer headed a second in the 65th minute .
Petersen then equalised with their first penalty in the 89th minute , after Salih Ozcan fouled Nicolas Hoefler , and struck the winner from the spot in the fifth minute of stoppage time , this time following handball by Guirassy .
Cologne remained stuck on three points at the bottom , eleven adrift of Werder Bremen , while Freiburg climbed out of the direct relegation spots to 16th with 15 points .

The US “ Deep State ” and the Democrats ARE the problem by ANDREW KORYBKO – The Duran
The latest policy recommendations by the influential Director General of the Russian International Affairs Council ( RIAC ) , one of the most well-respected and listened-to experts in Russia – to say nothing of the entire former Soviet space – is causing quite a stir by waxing nostalgically about the Obama years and even suggesting that Moscow should embrace the American “ deep state ” .
Mr. Kortunov 's Case For Russia 's “ Deep State ” / Democrat Partnership
Mr. Andrey Kortunov is one of the most brilliant minds in Russia and earned their place as the Director General of the Russian International Affairs Council ( RIAC ) , and their words accordingly carry much weight for the fact that they set the tone for countless other analysts in the country and even an untold number of policymakers who look to them for guidance .
That 's why it caused quite a stir when they published their latest recommendation earlier this week at the famous Valdai Club titled “ Russian Approaches to the United States : Algorithm Change Is Overdue ” , in which they waxed nostalgically about the Obama years and even suggested that Moscow should embrace the American “ deep state ” .
So as not to put words in their mouth , the relevant passages are republished in their entirety below :
First , it is better to avoid demonizing the Deep State , which is perceived by many in Moscow as the center of world evil and the stronghold of the pathological haters of Russia . Of course , most of the State Department or the CIA officials , the Congress staff , experts from the main think tanks are not Vladimir Putin 's fans . But these people , at least , have considerable experience of interaction with Moscow and can hardly be considered stubborn paranoids , exalted conspiracy theorists or genetic Russophobes . Deep State consists of rationally thinking professionals , who are always easier to deal with than romantic amateurs are . With all its shortcomings , it is the Deep State that limits Donald Trump 's most exotic and potentially most dangerous foreign policy oddities . Second , it 's time to change the attitude toward the Democratic Party leadership . For some reason ( probably because of inertia ) the Barack Obama administration is constantly remembered in Russia in the worst possible way , with the two latest presidents constantly juxtaposed . How is Obama bad , and Trump is good ? The stubborn facts show otherwise . For example , Obama pursued a consistent policy of rapprochement with Iran , and Trump returned to the most severe pressure on Tehran . Obama followed the international consensus on the status of Jerusalem , and Trump destroyed this consensus . Obama did not resort to direct military action against Bashar Assad , and Trump did not hesitate to give an order to launch missiles against the Syrian Al- Shayrat airbase . Well , who after all created more problems for Russia — Democrats or Republicans ?

The financial giant Anbang Insurance Group Co. announced Wednesday that its chairperson , Wu Xiaohui , was stepping aside temporarily for “ personal reasons ” and that they had authorized “ relevant senior executives to continue running the business . ”
The announcement , which reportedly spurred a decline in stocks in which Anbang has significant investment , came just hours after the independent Chinese financial magazine Caijing reported that authorities had detained Wu .
The story was later deleted from the magazine 's website , but the BBC reported that police had taken Wu away from the Anbang offices in Beijing on Thursday .

Xiao 's reported $ 6-billion fortune made them China 's 32nd richest person in 2016 . Their conglomerate , the Tomorrow Group , includes investments in real estate , insurance , banking , coal , cement and rare earth minerals .

New Delhi : Delegates from as many as 52 countries , including the US and China , are participating in the informal meeting of the WTO being held here today amid increasing protectionism in global trade . India has called this meeting to explore options to reinvigorate the World Trade Organisation ( WTO ) .
Welcoming the participants , Commerce and Industry Minister Suresh Prabhu hoped that the meeting will provide opportunity to the participating countries to engage in free and frank discussions . The ministry said in a statement that delegations from 52 countries including WTO Director General Roberto Azevedo are participating in the discussions . Ministers and Vice Ministers from 27 countries are part of the delegations .
`` All heads of delegations appreciated the Commerce Minister 's initiative in calling this meeting and providing political guidance for the work in the WTO , '' it added . Informal discussions will continue through out the day and the delegates will explore in detail the option for reinvigorating the WTO .
Expressing concerns over increasing protectionism , Azevedo has said : `` There was the announcement by the US of new tariffs on steel and aluminium . In response , we also heard announcements of other potential trade restrictive actions by numerous other economies . This is of real concern . The risk of escalation is clear . '' They said that instead of escalating tensions , the WTO member countries need to find ways to resolve issues hampering global trade constructively .
The meeting assumes significance as the global trade appears fragile with certain developed countries threatening to retaliate the duty hike on steel and aluminium products by the Trump administration .
It was lights out at a Hartlepool school when the classrooms were plunged into darkness .

The non-electrity day was part of an eco fortnight at the Flint Walk school to encourage the children to think about how they can go greener and save energy on a daily basis .
Abby Davies , a class teacher and eco leader at the school , said the children were excited to take part in the event and eager to give living without electricity a go .
They said : “ We already have a green school award , so as part of this we are always looking at ways of improving .
“ For two weeks we have been concentrating on energy saving .
It was a great way for the children to really appreciate how much we rely on electricity Abby Davies
“ The children have been monitoring the lights , making sure they are switched off , and learning about energy saving and how important it is to be careful with what we have got . ”
As part of this work , the school agreed to go one step further and have a day without electricity .
Although the school office and the kitchen were allowed to operate as normal , the rest of the school had to find alternative ways to operate without the use of electricity .
This meant a day with no computers , whiteboards or tablets and the teachers even had to go back to the old fashioned way of taking the register with a list of names and a pen .
Ms Davies said : “ It was a great way for the children to really appreciate how much we rely on electricity in our everyday lives .
“ We wanted them to think about how much we use it and what it would be like if there was ever a time we did n't have it . ”
They said all the youngsters and staff got on board , with adults even having to go without a kettle for a brew throughout the day .
Across the school the staff and students brought in torches , candles and battery-operated lamps to do their work by in case it was a very dark day .
As part of their studies the children also had to think about alternative ways to do things if there was no power , such as what they would do for entertainment if they could n't watch television or play computer games .
Ms Davies said they are also using a monitor to calculate exactly how much electricity and money they will have saved during the non-electricity day .
Mumbai : Referring to the increasing number of prosecution witnesses turning hostile before the trial court in the Sohrabuddin Sheikh alleged fake encounter case , the High Court of Bombay on Wednesday said it can not be `` affected '' by developments in the trial court .
Justice AM Badar started the hearing afresh on the pleas filed by the Central Bureau of Investigation ( CBI ) and Sohrabuddin 's brother Rubabuddin Sheikh , challenging the discharge granted to a few Indian Police Service ( IPS ) officials and a constable who were accused in the case . The judge said they had to go by what the CBI presented as evidence in its chargesheet .
The observation came when Sheikh 's lawyer , Gautam Tiwari , began to read out a statement given by the prime prosecution witness , Nathuba Jadeja . Jadeja , a driver with the Gujarat Anti-Terrorist Squad in 2005 , had said in their statement before a magistrate in 2007 that they had witnessed the abduction of Sohrabuddin , their wife Kausar Bi and their aide Tulsiram Prajapati by the accused police officials .
According to the CBI , Sohrabuddin was killed in a fake encounter in November 2005 and their wife was killed later , while Prajapati was killed in another fake encounter in December 2006 .
In December last year , Jadeja retracted their statement while deposing before the trial court in Mumbai . They had claimed that the CBI had forced them to make the statement , and they were subsequently declared hostile . Senior lawyer Raja Thakare , representing some of the discharged police officials , pointed out that Jadeja had turned hostile , so their earlier statement should not carry weight . Justice Badar had refused to accept the argument .
`` We have read in the newspaper that witnesses are turning hostile , so the moment you raised an objection I understood that they ( Jadeja ) too must have turned hostile . That does n't matter at the revisional stage , since this court ca n't be affected by what is going on in the trial court right now . I have to go by what has been presented in the chargesheet , '' the judge said .
`` It is unfortunate , but the longer a trial takes , the greater the chances are of witnesses turning hostile . The accused then say they must be discharged . Apprehending such a situation , I had refused to stay the trial in the case in November last year , '' they said , adding that the defence will get a chance to make this argument at a later stage in the hearing .
Justice Badar on Wednesday also rejected the discharge pleas filed by two sub-inspectors of the Rajasthan Police . Sub-inspectors Himanshu Singh Rajawat and Shyam Charan Singh had filed a revision plea against the trial court 's order of July 2017 rejecting their discharge pleas .
The judge noted that the charges against the duo as well as the other accused have been framed , and the trial court has already examined 125 witnesses . Hence , this was not the stage to seek discharge , but it was now for the trial court to decide whether the accused should be convicted or not , they said .
Three petitions filed by Rubabuddin Sheikh against the discharge of IPS officers DG Vanzara , Dinesh MN and Rajkumar Pandian , and two petitions filed by the CBI against the discharge of IPS officer NK Amin and constable Dalpat Singh Rathod were left partly heard when the assignment of the earlier judge , who was hearing them , was changed in February .
Sohrabuddin Sheikh , a suspected gangster , and their wife Kausar Bi were allegedly abducted and killed by a team of Gujarat and Rajasthan Police in November 2005 . Prajapati was allegedly killed by some Rajasthan Police officers a year later .
The CBI filed a chargesheet against 38 persons for the alleged fake encounters . The trial court discharged 14 people , including Bharatiya Janata Party chief Amit Shah , from the case .
The state 's largest grower of peaches and other fruit bargained in bad faith with the United Farm Workers of America and wrongly tried to exclude as many as 1,500 employees from a collective bargaining agreement , a judge has ruled .
The decision gives a strong boost to the UFW 's claim to represent as many as 6,500 workers at Gerawan Farming Inc. , a 12,000-acre farm and packing operation in the San Joaquin Valley that has been the focal point of one of the longest-running and most acrimonious labor dispute in decades .
The decision also reaffirms that employees of labor contractors , who now provide about half the workers who pick the state 's crops , are covered by union contracts signed with the grower .
The Gerawan-UFW fight , which began in the early 1990s , has sparked the single largest effort to decertify a union , along with a flurry of labor board and court decisions , including one that has stalled the state 's ability to impose a contract on warring parties .
And these parties have been at war , Administrative Law Judge William L. Schmidt acknowledged in a decision issued Friday .
Co-owner Dan Gerawan 's undisguised anger with the union , Schmidt wrote , “ appears deep and unusually long-lasting , ” and “ perhaps explains the motive underlying the current expenditure of what must have been enormous sums by the Gerawan enterprises opposing the UFW and seeking to rid itself of any legal obligation to deal with that organization . ”
Gerawan showed “ at most , a lackadaisical attitude … and at worst , complete hostility ” and “ almost certainly guaranteed ” a mediator would have to step in and impose a contract in 2013 , Schmidt wrote .
Armando Elenes , a spokesperson for the UFW , said the decision “ confirms what we 've been saying all along — Gerawan has been undermining the law . They 're trying to undermine the state of California . ”
Gerawan 's lead attorney , David Schwarz , blasted the decision and promised an appeal — none of the previous decisions in the case has gone without appeals from the growers and the Agricultural Labor Relations Board .
“ Gerawan is confident that these undemocratic decisions will not stand , and will challenge this latest erroneous ruling , ” Schwarz said Monday . They accused the judge of blaming the grower for the union 's “ unexplained , 17-year absence ” from Gerawan 's fields .
Schmidt 's ruling appears to undermine Gerawan 's assertion that the union abandoned their workers in the mid-1990s before returning in 2012 to demand the right to negotiate a new contract . Gerawan has argued that UFW was solely looking to pad its membership and coffers — it collects dues of 3 % of each member 's gross pay — by deliberately running out the clock on negotiations so it could obtain a contract imposed by a mediator .
Workers faced with those dues petitioned to hold an election to decertify the UFW — a stinging irony for the union founded by Cesar Chavez to obtain humane treatment of farmworkers . Union membership , once as high as 70,000 , has fallen to just over 7,000 .
Ballots from the 2013 decertification election never were counted , and last year the Agricultural Labor Relations Board — itself an outgrowth of Chavez 's labor movement — nullified the vote , saying Gerawan undermined the union by directly supporting an employee leading the ouster effort .
Schmidt ordered Gerawan to find and compensate employees for the eight-month period of bargaining impasse in 2013 , and to allow officials from the Agricultural Labor Relations Board to enter their property to explain the decision and discuss rights with their current workforce — sessions that are to be paid for by Gerawan . The grower also will have to mail the decision to workers and post it at work sites for 60 days , Schmidt ruled .
The ALRB will issue a decision based on the judge 's opinion . That decision can be appealed .

California sued the Trump administration Friday , claiming it unlawfully discriminated against women in its decision to limit an Obama-era rule that requires employers to provide for contraceptives in their health insurance plans .
The lawsuit filed in federal court in San Francisco says the new rules jeopardize the Affordable Care Act requirement that employers provide coverage of birth control for employees with no out-of-pocket costs , according to state Atty . Gen. Xavier Becerra , who filed the lawsuit seeking to block the change .
“ Therefore , millions of women in California may be left without access to contraceptives and counseling and the state will be shouldering the additional fiscal and administrative burden as women seek access for this coverage through state-funded programs , ” the lawsuit says .
The lawsuit also alleges the rule changes violate the 1st Amendment 's Establishment Clause because they allow employers to use religious beliefs as a right to discriminate against employees to deny them a federally entitled health benefit .
Becerra has filed more than two dozen legal actions challenging policy changes by President Trump since the Republican entered the White House in January .
“ Donald Trump wants businesses and corporations to control family planning decisions rather than a woman in consultation with their doctor , ” Becerra said in a statement Friday . “ These anti-women 's health regulations prove once again that the Trump Administration is willing to trample on people 's rights . ”
Batti Gul Meter Chalu stars Shahid , Shraddha Kapoor resume shooting for film in Uttarakhand
With Bhushan Kumar and Krishan Kumar taking over the reigns of Batti Gul Meter Chalu from Prerna Arora of the troubled KriArj Productions , the Shahid Kapoor and Shraddha Kapoor starrer has resumed its stalled shoot schedule with the actors heading to Uttarakhand as reported by Mumbai Mirror .
The shoot is set to resume in Tehri and Dehradun and will continue into mid-June , following which the crew will return to Mumbai to wrap up the schedule . Shahid and Shraddha had already shot for a long schedule in Tehri in February before the production had run into trouble in March . Yami Gautam , who plays a lawyer in the social drama , will join the team to shoot their portions of the movie in the remaining Mumbai schedule . Shahid plays a small time lawyer who takes up the issue of outrageously high rural electricity bills despite constant power cuts . Yami is busy learning the ropes of the Bombay High Court in preparation of their character .
The film was stalled following non-payment of crew wages in March after similar troubles had hit the production of John Abraham 's Parmanu - The Story of Pokhran , Rajkummar Rao 's Fanne Khan , and Sushant Singh Rajuput starrer Kedarnath . With Ronnie Screwvala taking over Kedarnath , John Abraham terminating the contract with Prerna Arora , and Bhushan Kumar stepping in to prouduce both Batti Gul Meter Chalu , and Fanne Khan ( following the exit of Prerna Arora 's KriArj entertainment from all on-going projects ) , the films seem to be back on track .

It was two years ago when Phil Kessel read a scathing article after the Toronto Maple Leafs traded them to the Pittsburgh Penguins .
The column penned by Steve Simmons of the Toronto Sun purported that the Leafs had to deal Kessel because they were `` sick of their act '' and `` tired of their lack of responsibility . '' These barbs followed an introductory paragraph detailing Kessel 's hot dog diet near the end of their time in Toronto .
Fast-forward to August 2017 , and Kessel is now a two-time Stanley Cup champion , their Penguins having recently defeated the Nashville Predators in six games . But despite the various celebrations that have since ensued , Kessel has n't forgotten about Simmons ' article and took to Instagram to let the world know .
Hotdogs taste better out of The Cup ! # twotime # statestreetbrats A post shared by Phil Kessel ( @ phil_kessel_81_ ) on Aug 14 , 2017 at 2:07pm PDT
There probably is n't a better response -- two years in the making -- than eating hot dogs from the palm of Lord Stanley . Chalk up another victory for Kessel in 2017 .

Chandigarh : Chaos erupted in the Punjab assembly on Thursday after the opposition Aam Aadmi Party ( AAP ) and Shiromani Akali Dal insisted on separate adjournment motions leading to clashes .
On the second day of the budget session , Akali Dal legislators accused Punjab local government and tourism minister Navjot Singh Sidhu of using unparliamentary language .
Sidhu could be seen shouting slogans against the Akali Dal leaders while they were demanding an adjournment motion on the issue of the promise made by the Congress government on a loan waiver for the farming community .
The AAP legislators sought to bring a separate adjournment motion on the land dealings of irrigation and power minister Rana Gurjit Singh .
However , Speaker Rana KP Singh did not allow the adjournment motions , leading to noisy exchanges . The speaker adjourned the house twice .
The AAP legislators started a sit-in protest inside the assembly building , saying they wanted to highlight the wrongdoings of Rana Gurjit Singh .
AAP leader HS Phoolka said they were holding their own `` session '' in the assembly building as they were not allowed to raise their voice inside the house .
The Congress had promised a loan waiver for the debt-ridden Punjab farmers in the run up to the assembly elections earlier this year . The Congress , now led by chief minister Amarinder Singh , won 77 seats in the 117-member state assembly .
Punjab finance minister Manpreet Badal said the Akali Dal was bereft of issues and was unnecessarily raising the farmers ' debt and loan waiver issue .
They said the Congress-led government was committed to its loan waiver promise which would be announced in the budget for the state to be presented in this session .
Simply changing your eating habits and choosing better snacks can be a great way to ensure that you have proper nutrition . For example , eating nuts and leafy greens more often can help you stay balanced . Remember the tips in this article to make sure you are eating nutritiously and serving your body well .
Be aware of what chemicals are in your food . This is generally why it 's best to stick to natural food like natural produce and fresh proteins and natural grain options . You should avoid these like you would anything else hazardous because they can slow down your metabolic rate and harm your diet .
Did you know that you can fight fatigue that is experienced after eating ? You can snap out of the tiredness you feel after lunch by drinking a tall glass of water and eating a small high-antioxidant food such as a prune . This will help revitalize your lethargic feeling and help fire up the mind .
One way of maintaining good health is to visit the doctor on a regular basis . By doing this the individual will be aware of any health issues that they may have and therefore removing the risk of being ill or sick . It is advisable to go to the doctor at least twice a year .
One of the most effective nutrition tips is to make certain to eat a good breakfast each and every day . Ingesting the right kind of calories at the start of the day 's activities helps jump start the metabolism and provides the energy the body needs to perform efficiently .
Focus on getting a lot of protein throughout the week . Opt for fish , skinless poultry and lean meats . Eggs make a wonderful source of protein in moderation . Studies show that eating a single egg every day is not likely to adversely impact your health . Have one day without meat every week . Use seeds , peanut butter , peas , or beans instead .
Dairy products are a great source of calcium and vitamin D , which help to build bone mass . Additionally , studies have shown that 1,000 milligrams of calcium per day , can help you lose weight , particularly around your midsection . Low-fat yogurt is highly versatile and can be used as a substitute for sour cream , mayonnaise and even cheese .
Animal fats are seen as culprits of high cholesterol by many nutritionists , so many people are avoiding animal fats . The mainstream recommendation is currently that we make animal fats no more than 10 % of our caloric intake . But , there is another voice that says these fats contain necessary nutrients , amino acids that contain carnitine and other substances vital to fat metabolism .
A good nutrition tip is to be sure your body is getting enough vitamin D. vitamin D is very important because it dictates how much calcium your body absorbs . An easy way to make sure you 're getting enough vitamin D is by getting a little bit of sun everyday .
A good nutrition tip is to start taking iodine as a supplement . Iodine works to produce the T4 and T3 hormones , which are essential in regulating your thyroid . If you 've been to the doctor and you found out your T4 or T3 levels are down , taking an iodine supplement can be very beneficial .
When you are out traveling the globe , take some time to sample the local food . If you are frightened by the prospect of eating something that you could find disgusting to your palate , stick to mainstream fare . You should be able to easily avoid the mystery meals , when you do this .
When you are looking for something to snack on , open the refrigerator . You will most likely find choices that are more healthy than anything you can find in your pantry or freezer . Try filling your fridge with fruits and vegetables so you always have easy access to a snack .
Rather than stressing yourself out by trying to identify things to cut from your daily diet , think about how you can add healthy and nutritious snacks and foods to your regimen . If you make a commitment to add in more vegetables or fiber-rich foods , you may find that you are satisfied with the change and do n't even miss the unhealthy snacks .
If you 're pregnant , make sure you limit the amount of caffeine you ingest . You should n't drink more than two cups of coffee a day while you 're pregnant . Too much caffeine can lead to you either having a miscarriage or the baby being underweight when it 's born , so it 's important to limit the amount you take in .
Apples are great sources of nutrition . They are full of fiber , including pectins , which help make you full , pleasantly sweet , contain lots of antioxidants , and in general fill you up without too many calories . Their portability also makes them great for having as a snack between meals or taking to the office .
Having a proper diet goes a long way with health ; if you are eating the rightsthings and making sure you have low cholesterol , salts , sugars , and fats , it is guaranteed that you will feel better . Remember the tips in this article to maintain a good diet and eat nutritiously .

Despite getting nominated for an Emmy for an episode that centered on their election , Donald Trump is really starting to harsh Wanda Sykes ' mellow .
“ It 's been rough . I 'm trying to get into other things , ” Sykes said of the seven months of the Trump administration during a recent visit to The Times ' video studio .
But it has n't been easy for the comedian , actor and writer .
“ I wish I could care about ‘ The Bachelorette , ' ” Sykes continued . “ I really do . I wish that I could go , ‘ Hey , what 's this Nicki Minaj/Remy Ma beef about ? ' I really wish I could care about these things more than politics and my country . ”
Sykes is not alone in being driven to distraction by the current administration , as evident from their guest actor Emmy-nominated turn in the “ black-ish ” episode “ Lemons . ”
The series , which focuses on the upper-middle-class Johnson family who live their lives as a black family in a predominantly white environment , examined the 2016 election through the lens of both work and school with deft portrayals of all sides of the issue .
Still , there 's an exhaustion to the news churn of 2017 .
“ I have a hard time doing stand-up now , ” Sykes explained . “ People who enjoy what I do , they have expectations . If I get on stage and I just talk about my family or the kids or ‘ Ooh , I 'm 53 now . I have a lot of hot flashes , ' while hilarious , people do n't want to hear that . ”
“ If I leave the stage without commenting on what 's happening and politics , then people feel like you 're not talking about the elephant in the room , ” Sykes added .
However , it 's not all bad news in the wake of the election .
“ Actually , Trump is making me smarter , ” they said . “ Because I 'm reading books . I 'm watching documentaries that I know they wo n't be in . ”
Them Emmy nomination for “ black-ish ” is Sykes ' eighth nod from the television academy , but their first for acting , having scored multiple nominations previously for their writing on “ The Chris Rock Show , ” as well as their stand-up special “ I 'm going to Be Me . ”
Sykes scored an Emmy win in 1999 for “ Rock ” but felt the nomination this year was different .
“ The other nominations , it was my work . They were my words , ” they said . “ Being nominated for just acting and saying other people 's words , it is different . It 's almost like I 'm a legitimate actor now . ”
Check out the full interview below for more from legitimate actor Wanda Sykes , including stories about binge-watching “ The Handmaid 's Tale , ” bowling scores and bringing back game shows .

Project Neptune is Aston Martin 's Dive Into The Depths
The Aston Martin name is synonymous with supercars , motor racing , style and a unique attitude , but it seems things are about to change in the near future . The British automaker is going down , literally , by heading to the depths with their latest project , that was simply called Project Neptune .
Submersible manufacturer Triton Submarines LLC agreed to join in on the project , with the end result meant to be an exclusive , strictly limited edition vehicle . Well , ‘ vehicle ' might not be the appropriate term to describe it . Based on Triton 's Low Profile platform , this ravishing project shows off Aston Martin 's awesome design language , premium materials , and fine craftsmanship .
Project Neptune aims to be a sleek and luxurious submersible , designed to enhance the superyacht experience . The flagship project for Aston Martin Consulting , this vision is a wonderful example of limitless thinking and a new approach to personal travel .
Triton strives to deliver the safest and best-performing submersibles in the world , with researchers , explorers , and superyacht owners already being among the company 's satisfied customers .
Feel free to add your name to the list and allow the most experienced civil submarine and submersible manufacturer to spoil you in the best of ways , as you explore the underwater world and enjoy the exclusivity that comes with such a human-made marvel .
I guess talking about possible purchase costs seems irrelevant right now , but we hope Triton and Aston Martin will release more details about this stunning project in the near future .
5 Reasons Startups Prefer Online Invoicing
Before companies can become fixtures in the U.S. business landscape , they begin as startups . Anyone who 's ever worked for a startup ( or launched one themselves ) knows how exciting this time can be for companies . Employees tend to wear many hats within the organization , passions run high and everyone has a hand in shaping company culture and reputation .
But startups lack the deep pockets of more established businesses . They often must outsource workflows and keep a close eye on their margins . The startup phase is make-or-break for companies in every sector : healthcare , data , human resources , financial services , transportation , entertainment , etc .
Turns out something as simple as intelligent invoicing can help startups trim fat and simplify accounting . Here are five reasons startups prefer online invoicing these days .
Keeps Clear Track of Consultants
Many startups choose to outsource various functions ( marketing , content creation , software development , HR , payroll , etc . ) rather than tackling them in house . As one writer notes for Entrepreneur , “ Outsourcing can lead to high levels of productivity at relatively reduced costs. ” Sometimes there simply are n't enough hours in the day or dollars in the budget to justify a full-time staff completing certain tasks .
Of course , this means startups must keep track of every contractor , freelancer and consultant they work with . Utilizing online invoicing makes the system simpler for both parties : virtual paper trails stay up to date and outstanding balances are obvious at a glance . This helps startups stay on top of what they owe—or what 's owed to them .
Ensures Timely Payment
Whether your startup is paying freelancers or billing a larger company for services your organization has performed , timely payment is everything . Paying and getting paid within a given window helps everyone avoid payment disputes ( and possibly even litigation ) .
Online invoicing can help startups stay on top of paying their third-party contractors , which is absolutely crucial for maintaining a good reputation on the web . After all , a missed payment or two and suddenly an unhappy contractor is smearing your name all over the internet , causing potential customers and clients to steer clear of your “ shady ” fledgling operation .
Integrates with Popular Payment Methods
Time is money in the world of startups—after all , most of them exist to make a current process faster , easier or more affordable . If you can shave time off routine tasks , you can channel it into more productive and impactful causes . A major reason to invoice online is because you can integrate electronic payments ( via credit card or PayPal ) right into your invoicing system with a digital wallet .
Takes Burden Off In-House Staff
It 's somewhat of a cultural cliché that in-house employees at startups routinely work long hours . But it 's often true . Although it 's been well established that a work-life balance is the key to career longevity and health , it simply takes a lot of elbow grease to get startups off the ground . Startups should prioritize smart processes that alleviate their staffs of unnecessary burden so they can do what 's important , but also have time to enjoy away from work .
Luckily , cloud-based invoicing simplifies accounting and recordkeeping so employees can spend less time sending emails , chasing down payments , verifying invoices and compiling records .
Grows with Companies
Scalability is huge with startups . After all , who knows how big the organization will be in six months ? A year ? Five years ? Any technology capable of growing with a startup is worth keeping around , and the right system for online invoicing works for small , medium and large businesses alike . Growth may be the goal , but it 's mighty inconvenient to constantly outgrow your tools . You want to develop processes and precedents for the long haul .
These five reasons startups prefer online invoicing demonstrate how utilizing a cloud-based invoicing system online can save time , hassle and human power—all crucial resources for new businesses .

Former prime minister Tony Abbott says some same-sex marriage advocates have attempted to set a disappointing tone to the debate .
Former prime minister Tony Abbott has warned against `` moral bullying '' ahead of a national postal vote on same-sex marriage .
Mr Abbott also criticised advocates who are against the public vote and want a full fledged parliamentary solution for implying Australians ca n't be trusted to `` have a sensible debate and make a considered decision '' .
The postal vote , due to be finalised by November pending the outcome of a High Court challenge , was announced last week by the federal government .

The coalition had previously pushed a plebiscite , which was Mr Abbott 's own initiative and was taken to the last election by their successor Malcolm Turnbull .
`` Last week , one very senior Labor senator attacked the prime minister for allegedly exposing their children to 'hatred ' because of their family circumstances , '' Mr Abbott wrote in The Australian on Tuesday .
`` It is not homophobic to maintain that , ideally , children should have both a mother and a father .
`` Yet I fear much moral bullying in the weeks to come - invariably from those demanding change . ''
Mr Abbott also said it was `` a pity the advocates of change have n't finalised what they think are fair protections for freedom of religion and freedom of speech in an era of same-sex marriage because it 's hard to be sure about something without knowing exactly what it may entail '' .
RELATED READING High Court challenge to same-sex marriage postal vote lodged SBS World News Radio : A High Court challenge has been lodged over the government 's proposed postal plebiscite .
Mr Abbott says voting no is not a criticism of one 's gay friends and family members or an `` assertion that there 's only one right way to live your life or to express your love '' .
Rather , they say , it will be `` an affirmation that the things that matter should not lightly be changed and that marriage is different from other relationships '' .

Tales of women in conflict , including “ Big Little Lies , ” “ The Handmaid 's Tale ” and “ Feud : Bette and Joan ” dominated the TV nominations for the 75th annual Golden Globes on Monday .
True to form , the Hollywood Foreign Press Assn. , which hands out the Golden Globes , honored an eclectic mix of new and returning series from cable networks , streaming services and broadcast networks , with perennial awards favorites HBO , Netflix and FX once again leading the TV pack .
FULL COVERAGE : 2018 Golden Globe nominations »
But at a moment when the mistreatment of women in Hollywood and in the halls of government is front-page news , the association recognized a number of projects dealing head-on with physical abuse , sexual exploitation and industry sexism .
Leading the network tally was HBO with 12 nominations , with half of those going to the limited series “ Big Little Lies ” -- the most-nominated show of the year . The all-star tale of a group of privileged California women caught up in a murder mystery will compete with “ Feud : Bette and Joan ” and “ Fargo ” ( both FX ) , “ The Sinner ” ( USA ) and “ Top of the Lake : China Girl ” ( SundanceTV ) for limited series or TV movie .
As it did at the Emmys , “ Big Little Lies ” scored nominations for its leads , Reese Witherspoon and Nicole Kidman . Supporting performers Shailene Woodley , Alexander Skarsgard and Laura Dern were also recognized in their respective categories .
HBO 's biopic about convicted financier Bernie Madoff , “ The Wizard of Lies , ” picked up two nominations in the limited series or movie made for TV category for stars Robert De Niro ( actor ) and Michelle Pfeiffer ( supporting actor ) .
“ Big Little Lies ” is closely followed by “ Feud : Bette and Joan , ” which scored a total of four nominations . The limited series , from prolific producer-writer Ryan Murphy , explores the infamous rivalry between screen legends Joan Crawford and Bette Davis . Jessica Lange , who played Crawford , and Susan Sarandon , who played Davis , were both nominated for actor in a limited series or TV movie , and will face off against Kidman and Witherspoon .
Jessica Biel is a surprise entrant in the category , nominated for their portrayal of a young mother accused of murder in USA 's “ The Sinner . ”
Hulu 's Emmy-winning “ The Handmaid 's Tale , ” based on the novel by Margaret Atwood and set in a dystopian future where women are forced to become reproductive slaves , scored three nominations , including one for drama series . It was the only first-year student nominee in a category otherwise dominated by returning series .
Rounding out the category are Netflix 's retro-supernatural tale “ Stranger Things , ” its lavish royal drama “ The Crown ” and NBC 's popular family weepie “ This Is Us. ” “ Game of Thrones , ” which was on hiatus last year , also returned to the category .
The HFPA , known for favoring the new and shiny , was particularly keen on comedies centered on females , recognizing “ The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel , ” a snappy period piece about a housewife turned stand-up comic that debuted last month on Amazon , and “ SMILF , ” Showtime 's black comedy about a single mom and sexual abuse survivor , for comedy or musical series .
“ Master of None , ” Aziz Ansari 's semi-autobiographical Netflix comedy , also landed a series nomination for the first time . In the old-but-new department is NBC 's revival of “ Will & Grace. ” Rounding out the category is ABC 's “ black-ish , ” also nominated last year .
Notably , all five nominees for actor in a comedy or musical were first-time honorees for their particular roles . Competing are Rachel Brosnahan , who plays the title character in “ The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel , ” Issa Rae of HBO 's “ Insecure , ” Pamela Adlon of FX 's “ Better Things ” and Alison Brie of Netflix 's “ GLOW ” . Previous winners and nominees including Tracee Ellis Ross ( “ black-ish ” ) , Julia Louis-Dreyfus ( “ Veep ” ) and Rachel Bloom ( “ Crazy Ex-Girlfriend ” ) were shut out .
The category for lead actor in a drama series included nearly as many fresh faces .
Elisabeth Moss , the Emmy-winning lead of “ The Handmaid 's Tale , ” was nominated alongside newcomers Katherine Langford , the star of Netflix 's teen suicide mystery “ 13 Reasons Why ” and Maggie Gyllenhaal of HBO 's gritty ‘ 70s porn drama “ The Deuce. ” Returning to the category is Caitriona Balfe of Starz 's time-traveling romance “ Outlander , ” and last year 's winner , Claire Foy , who stars as a young Queen Elizabeth II in “ The Crown . ”
In the actor in a drama series category , first-timers Jason Bateman of Netflix 's “ Ozark , ” Sterling K. Brown of “ This Is Us ” and Freddie Highmore of “ The Good Doctor ” will face off against returning nominees Liev Schreiber ( Showtime 's “ Ray Donovan ” ) and Bob Odenkirk ( AMC 's “ Better Call Saul ” ) .
In the comedy or musical actor category , Kevin Bacon earned their first nomination for the Amazon series “ I Love Dick. ” They will compete with actors who are returning to the category in roles they 've played before , including Ansari , Anthony Anderson ( “ black-ish ” ) Eric McCormack ( “ Will & Grace ” ) and William H. Macy ( Showtime 's “ Shameless ” ) .
Notably absent from the running was three-time nominee and 2014 winner Jeffrey Tambor , who stars as a transgender woman in Amazon 's “ Transparent . ”

Robert L. McKay , the former architect who designed the first Taco Bell restaurant and helped transform the brand into a fast-food powerhouse , has died of cancer in Santa Ana . They were 86 .
It was 1964 when McKay , then a Sherman Oaks architect , was hired by Taco Bell founder Glen Bell to create a distinctive new look for the business . Bell had opened their first Taco Bell in Downey in 1962 , selling hard shell tacos and other Mexican-inspired foods .
McKay took the concept and designed the California Spanish-style mission motif , arched and tiled with the rooftop bell that became the signature image of the company .
Bell decided McKay could do more than just architectural design ; Bell opened the company 's headquarters in Torrance and hired McKay to be president . McKay closed their architectural and contracting business and devoted their full energy to Taco Bell .
The company went public in 1969 and McKay eventually became chief executive . In 1978 , Taco Bell was sold to PepsiCo and McKay stayed on as president and chief executive until 1981 .
By then McKay was ready to move on .
“ I was n't ever comfortable sitting around conference tables in fancy resorts listening to presentations from the very people doing the great work of running the company every day , ” they said .
In 1982 , McKay turned their attention to financing and building new businesses . For the next 30 years , McKay invested in ventures ranging from technology and consumer products to real estate and fine art .
They were particularly proud of their involvement in building the National Bank of Southern California in Santa Ana into an important source of capital for local businesses . The bank was sold to US Bancorp in 1999 .
In 1992 , the McKay Family Foundation was formed , dedicated to social justice and community organizing work , particularly the rebuilding effort after the 1992 Los Angeles riots .
Separately , McKay and their wife , Meagan , were most proud of their work funding the creation of the Redeemer School in Jackson , Miss. , for very-low-income children .
McKay , who died last week , is survived by their wife , Meagan ; two sons , Rob and John ; and five grandchildren .

Selena Gomez to drop new album in 2018 , says work is in 'full motion '
Pop star Selena Gomez has confirmed that they have been working on their new album , which will be coming out next year .
Gomez released several singles in 2017 , including 'Bad Liar ' , 'Fetish ' , and 'Wolves ' , but has not released a complete album since 2015 's 'Revival ' .
`` There is no might , there is an album . And I think it 's fair to say that people know the year I 've had , and I 've poured my heart into my music and I wanted it to be fresh . It was n't really about charts for me or numbers .
`` It was more just about what I could creatively do for my music . Yes , I can successfully say that my inspiration for this next album is in full motion and it will be very soon , '' Gomez said during an appearance on BBC 's The Radio 1 Breakfast Show With Nick Grimshaw .
The US House of Representatives has once again advanced a law bill that would always require the FBI and cops to obtain a warrant from a judge before forcing email providers to hand over people 's messages .
The latest incarnation of what was the Email Privacy Act comes in the form of an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act , the annual legislation that sets the budget for the Department of Defense . That bill passed the House last week in a 351-66 vote , and is now off to the Senate to approve .
The amendment to that defense spending , written by Rep. Kevin Yoder ( R-KS ) , would add the requirement of a court-issued warrant when asking for stored communications , changing Section 2703 of title 18 in the United States Code .
To obtain said warrant , the Feds would have to demonstrate probable cause , rather than freely go on fishing expeditions for people 's private communications .
`` A governmental entity may require the disclosure by a provider of electronic communication service of the contents of a wire or electronic communication that is in electronic storage with or otherwise stored , held , or maintained by that service only if the governmental entity obtains a warrant issued using the procedures described in the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure , '' the amendment declared .
America edges closer to get-a-proper-warrant-to-read-my-email law READ MORE
The amendment is the latest in a years-long push by Yoder and Jared Polis ( D-CO ) to get a formal email privacy law on the books . Going back to 2013 , various forms of the bill have failed to gain passage . Most recently , the bill was passed by the House , but was defeated at the Senate committee stage .
Making the rules an amendment tacked on to a larger spending bill could improve the chance it passes – the Senate can , of course , opt to take out the amendment , pass the bill , and send it back to the House .
An appeals court ruled in 2010 that police should get a warrant before pulling data stored by ISPs . The act would formalize that decision by putting the requirement directly into federal law .
Right now , the FBI and cops do not need a warrant if a message is older than 180 days , whereas emails under that time limit may require a warrant . The sixth circuit appeals decision means investigators must obtain a full search warrant for personal emails and other conversations stored online – a requirement privacy activists are keen to see enshrined in federal law .
Backers of the act , including the EFF , are optimistic that , inserted as an amendment , the latest version of the Email Privacy Act may finally be able to get through Congress and reach the desk of the President to approve .
`` In the past , Senate Republicans have been extremely resistant to the Email Privacy Act in any form , attaching poison pill amendments to derail prior roads to success , '' the EFF 's David Ruiz said on Tuesday .
`` The Senate is currently working on their own version of the NDAA , and EFF will be working to ensure that the Email Privacy Act is included without poison pills in the bill that goes to the President . '' ®

Lausanne : The International Hockey Federation ( FIH ) on Monday issued a warning to its president Narinder Batra and fined them for their outburst against English law enforcement authorities during the Hockey World League Semi-Final in London last year .
Batra , also the IOA president , is however , not restricted in any way to pursue their functions as the FIH president .
Batra , a former Hockey India president , had accused English law enforcement authorities of acting in an inappropriate manner while summoning Indian player Sardar Singh for questioning in connection with an alleged sexual assault case .
A day ahead of the group game against Pakistan in London , former captain Sardar was summoned at Leeds by Yorkshire police after a complaint filed by an England international hockey player of Indian origin .
Speaking in their personal capacity , Batra had slammed the move by the UK authorities to question Sardar in the middle of a tournament without any prior intimation .
Batra 's outburst had led to the FIH initiating disciplinary proceedings against him .
`` The FIH Replacement Disciplinary Commissioner has concluded a disciplinary proceeding against the President of FIH , Dr Narinder Dhruv Batra , regarding a Facebook post on 19 June 2017 on their personal account in which English law enforcement authorities were accused of acting in an inappropriate manner in relation to the summoning of Indian player Sardar Singh during the Hero Hockey World League Semi-Final London 2017 , '' the FIH said in a statement .
`` Dr Batra regrets their actions and has publicly apologised for their emotional statement . Dr Batra was given a written warning . They shall pay an undisclosed amount to a sports charity institution and bear the costs of the disciplinary proceeding , '' it added .
“ I said , over and over , ‘ I do n't want to do this , stop , do n't , ' ” Evans told the New Yorker . “ I tried to get away , but maybe I did n't try hard enough . I did n't want to kick them or fight him. ” In the end , they said , “ he 's a big guy . They overpowered me. ” They added : “ I just sort of gave up . That 's the most horrible part of it , and that 's why he 's been able to do this for so long to so many women : People give up , and then they feel like it 's their fault . ”
NASHVILLE—The new season of Nashville starts with traditional songs rooted in gospel and folk music rather than big production country songs.Rayna , played by Connie Britton , finds a revelation after hearing a blind man singing “ Wayfaring Stranger , ” an Appalachian tune estimated to be two centuries old . And Juliette , played by Hayden Panettiere , sees an angelic vision in white singing the hymn “ God Shall Wipe All Tears Away. ” Cancelled by ABC after four seasons , the new season of Nashville begins Thursday at 9 p.m. , on CMT in the U.S. and W in Canada , and it aims to reflect more diversity in both the music and the cast . In recurring roles this season : Grammy-winning banjo player and singer Rhiannon Giddens and writer-actor-producer Jen Richards , the first out transgender actor on a CMT series. “ I have spent so much of my life studying and playing music that has gone into country music : the banjo , the fiddle , the string band tunes , ” said Giddens , the lead singer of the African-American string band Carolina Chocolate Drops.Article Continued BelowFans of contemporary country music may recognize Giddens , who sings the hymn in the first episode , from their duet with Eric Church on the Country Music Association Awards show in November. “ It is time for the real history of country music to have more of a highlight , for people to know that there were lots of black people who played the banjo , that the string band itself came from plantation culture , ” said Giddens.The changes behind the scenes include new showrunners Marshall Herskovitz and Edward Zwick , who created the show Thirtysomething and were executive producers on My So-Called Life .

We 're often told that goal-setting in swimming is a must , but sometimes members of the swimming community too narrowly define what a “ good ” goal is .
Most of the time , preseason goal-setting meetings between swimmers and coaches result in goals to achieve specific times . These times may be qualifying times for a certain meet , record-breaking times , or simply personal bests .
If set correctly , this type of goal is a classic “ SMART ” goal ( Specific , Measureable , Attainable , Relevant , and Time-bound ) and is perfect for some swimmers . It 's also easy for coaches – the measurable nature makes it easier to assess and adjust as the season goes on .
But the best coaches realize that goal setting should not be applied in a one-size fits all approach . Rather , coaches should help their swimmers set goals that complement the athletes ' individual personalities . And for some swimmers , goals to swim specific times are more harmful than beneficial .
When Goal-Setting Goes Wrong
If you 've been around the sport long enough , you 've seen that swimmer who gets too caught up in times . For this swimmer , every suboptimal race result and every split in practice turn into numbers spinning through their head , piling on pressure and casting doubt on their ability to reach their goal time . The goal time becomes a threatening barrier that must be overcome to avoid failure , rather than an exciting target to reach for .
Though that may seem like a subtle change , it 's disastrous to some swimmers who , in many cases , lose their love for swimming and leave the sport altogether . In worse situations , it can lead to eating disorders and other psychological difficulties .
Unfortunately , in the past many would respond by saying those swimmers should just toughen up , or that they 're not cut out for the sport . Fortunately , the swimming community is learning to address mental health struggles in healthier ways . And , while it 's true that a session or two with a sports psychologist would probably help in this scenario , it 's also true that there are simple changes a coach can make for those swimmers who need to learn to let go , but do n't know how .
How Coaches Can Adjust
Coaches – this is where it 's your job to help . If you notice that you have an athlete who seems to focus so much on the times that they lose perspective and focus , take their attention off the times . Do n't give them a choice !
Stop giving their times in practice , stop encouraging them to set goal times before the season , and help the parents understand that they should n't focus solely on times either ( especially in-season ! ) . Instead , encourage the swimmer ( and the parents ) to focus on the process . Force the swimmer to think about something else , in order to take their mind off that number that 's turned into such a burden .
Doing this is simple , so I encourage you to try it , even if you 're doubtful . If you think you have swimmers who collapse under the pressure of time-based goals , change how you work with those swimmers to set pre-season goals . Rather than encouraging goals for specific times at the end of the season , suggest more process-oriented goals .
Here are a few examples :
Take 8 kicks off each wall for fly and back during practice
Maintain a certain turnover rate for all race-pace swimming ( both in practice and at meets )
Do n't breathe off walls in freestyle
Be better about staying hydrated through the day
Stop voicing negativity during practice
Smile after every race
If you have more ideas for process-oriented goals , or if you 've benefited from changing your goal-setting strategy , please share in the comments below !
Xiaomi is continuing to lead the way when it comes to value in the entry-level segment . Launched earlier this year , the Redmi 4A proved to be incredibly successful for Xiaomi , with the brand selling over four million units in eight months . The company is now looking to continue the same with its successor , the Redmi 5A . At the outset , there is n't a whole lot that 's changed from the Redmi 4A : you get the same internal hardware , and while the exterior has been slightly tweaked , the phone has the same design language . So how else does one differentiate a phone that does n't stand out from its predecessor ? By lowering the price point . The Redmi 5A is available for just ₹4,999 ( $ 77 ) , making it Xiaomi 's most affordable phone to date . That 's the same tactic the company used to its benefit earlier this year with the Redmi 4A , and by launching the 5A for a whole ₹1,000 less , Xiaomi is continuing to lead the way when it comes to value in the entry-level segment . Xiaomi is marketing the device as `` desh ka smartphone , '' which translates to the country 's smartphone . By making it available for under ₹5,000 , Xiaomi is looking to attract first-time buyers that would otherwise be content with picking up a feature phone . Xiaomi Redmi 5A What you 'll like
There really was n't much wrong with the Redmi 4A from a design standpoint , and as such Xiaomi 's did n't radically alter the aesthetic with its successor . The phone retains the 5.0-inch display and plastic construction , but the back has a coating that gives the device a metallic feel . Another subtle change is the addition of subtle curves at the point where the back meets the sides , which makes the phone easier to hold . The Redmi 5A is lightweight at 137g , and although you get sizeable bezels at the top and bottom , the smaller screen allows you to use the device one-handed without any issues . You get an LED notification light , capacitive navigation buttons at the bottom of the screen , IR blaster , and a speaker located at the back of the phone .
On the hardware front , the Redmi 5A is packing the Snapdragon 425 — the same chipset that powered the Redmi 4A . In fact , the only major change when it comes to the hardware is the battery size , which is a downgrade from the 3120mAh unit on the Redmi 4A . That said , you wo n't have any issues getting a day 's worth of usage from a full charge . Elsewhere , you 're looking at 2GB/3GB of RAM , 16GB/32GB of storage , 13MP rear camera , 5MP front shooter , Wi-Fi 802.11 b/g/n , Bluetooth 4.1 , and FM radio . The phone comes with MIUI 9 out of the box , and all the optimizations carried out by Xiaomi in terms of reducing app load times and improving stability make a significant difference when it comes to using the Redmi 5A on a day-to-day basis . The Redmi 5A has rock-solid build quality and reliable performance . I 'm using the variant with 2GB of RAM and 16GB of storage , and even on the base model performance is generally snappy . That said , the phone is n't ideal if you 're looking to play visually-intensive games . There 's also the odd stutter when transitioning from one app to another . The Redmi 5A retains the same 5.0-inch 720p display that was used in the 4A , and while the panel wo n't win any awards , it is perfectly serviceable . Like all other Xiaomi phones , you get the option to adjust the color balance and use a blue light filter to reduce glare at night . The full loadout of MIUI 9 features is available on the Redmi 5A , including the Dual Apps feature that lets you run two instances of an app at the same time , new themes and sticker packs , notification pane that has bundled notifications and in-line replies , and so much more . With the advent of Jio , the number of people using two SIM cards simultaneously has increased . Xiaomi offered a hybrid SIM card slot in its early 2017 phones , with the secondary SIM tray doubling up as the microSD slot . However , with a sizeable portion of the audience requesting a standalone microSD slot , Xiaomi has switched out the usual tray for one with a dedicated microSD slot in addition to two SIM card slots . That 's not the only customization for the Indian market — Xiaomi started bundling a custom wall charger for phones sold in India to withstand the wildly varying voltages seen in most parts of the country , and the Redmi 5A comes with the charger in the box . Xiaomi Redmi 5A What you wo n't
The main drawback of the Redmi 5A is the camera . Like the Redmi 4A , you 'll have to put a lot of work to get a half-decent image . That 's true for all devices in this segment , and the Redmi 5A is no different . Photos taken in daylight look washed out and grainy , and image quality is particularly woeful in low-light shots , with the phone refusing to lock in on a subject on the first try . The camera on the Redmi 5A is n't worth your time . The front camera is similarly sub-par , and while the device offers an HDR mode , it takes far too long to process photos . Xiaomi also missed a trick by not including the fingerprint sensor on the Redmi 5A . Bundling it would 've been a significant feature addition — one that would 've served to differentiate the Redmi 5A from its predecessor — but that is n't to be . And while it 's great that the phone comes with MIUI 9 out of the box , the custom ROM is still based on Android 7.1.2 Nougat . As of now , there 's no information regarding Xiaomi 's Oreo update plans , and it 'll likely be a long time before the update is available for the device . Xiaomi Redmi 5A Bottom line

`` Another beautiful dawn service organised by the Returned Services Club , the C.ex a big crowd turned up probably 5,000 at least , probably more and as usual a great deal of enthusiasm and the comradery and spirit with people as they are walking in the dark towards the Dawn Service is something that I always appreciate , '' Russell said .
`` Those few minutes that we take out every year to show thanks and respect for the men and women who have served our country and fallen in the course of their duty I think to me is very special and it 's a very important part of our culture .
`` This morning unfortunately the mayor , the two local members and the area command superintendent could n't make it , obviously needed a sleep because of the pressures that are going to come upon for the nine o'clock march and service , but I think that 's relatively poor form and I know them all and they are very good people and I 'm sure me needling them about that in this way will probably ensure that they do turn up again next year , '' Russell said .
The Advocate has asked the question of local politicians after the comments .
Coffs Harbour City Council Mayor Denise Knight confirmed that they attended the Dawn Service at Woolgoolga and will be attending this morning 's marches at Coffs Harbour and Sawtell .
Cowper MP Luke Hartsuyker has confirmed that they attended the Dawn Service in Port Macquarie then quickly jumped in their car to drive up the newly upgraded Pacific Hwy to also attend the Coffs Harbour and Sawtell marches .
State Member for Coffs Harbour Andrew Fraser confirmed that they also attended the Woolgoolga Dawn Service and will be attending the Coffs Harbour and Sawtell mid morning services and marches .
They said they recall attending services when the cenotaph was positioned near Coffs Harbour 's old police station and court house .
`` I know I attended my first Dawn Service in Coffs Harbour when I was five with my grandmother , '' Mr Fraser said .
`` There 's only been two Anzac Day services I 've missed since then . One was when I was at Flanders Fields and the other I was at Villers-Bretonneux . ''
Mr Fraser said Anzac Day is a special one for them due to their personal connection .
The Member for Coffs Harbour said their grandfather was a gunner who met heavy artillery fighting with the 1st AIF at Villers-Bretonneux .
`` He was wounded twice and came home with shell shock . It was a tragedy , '' Mr Fraser said .
They added their grandmother 's brother was killed on the very last day of fighting in World War 1 .
`` I have the utmost respect for those who fought and sacrificed so much to give us our democracy , '' Mr Fraser said .
Despite the hype and the bravado expressed in the pre-game media engagements , the Pakistan team that walked on the field to face India on the 4 June in what was termed the ‘ El Clasico ' of cricket was a mere shadow of its glorious predecessors . A clearly irate Mickey Arthur in their post-game press conference after the fiasco against India was to describe their wards as overcome by the magnitude of the occasion which really seemed to be an admission of meek surrender .
The Pakistan team that stepped on to the pitch in Edgbaston on 4 June appeared devoid of any backbone and seemed to go through the motions as if the result was inevitable . The fielding was insipid , the batting lacked any planning but more importantly , Pakistan 's bowling was timid and offered no challenge to the opposition . The hesitancy to attack due to fear of failure was apparent from the start of the India innings and with that mindset , things could only go downhill as was clear from the final result .
As many would remark at the end of the 124-run drubbing that the Pakistan side received at the hands of their neighbour and arch-rival , the side was closer to a group of frightened kittens as compared to the much publicized ‘ Cornered Tigers ' that the legendary Imran Khan spoke about during their victorious campaign in the 1992 World Cup .
The Imran Khan philosophy of unmitigated attack was one that they instilled in their side and left as a legacy for others to learn and follow once they retired . To the Great Khan , attack was a byword for success at the international level where better opposing sides could sniff fear from any sort of defensive approach . Imran 's philosophy was to not take any backward steps against any opposition and it was an ideology that reaped rewards .
The ethos of all-out attack as the only strategy for victory was one that any team that Imran Khan was involved in demonstrated and no better example of that was in the manner in which they used the likes of Wasim Akram and Waqar Younis under their leadership .
To attack with two great fast bowlers in the most aggressive manner with fields set to put fear in the eyes of the opposing batsmen was something that Pakistan teams put into practice time and time again . It may appear strange in today 's world where statistics are over-analysed but the mantra of bowling as fast as you can without worrying about such things as extras or being hit for the occasional boundary was the order of the day in the old days under Imran .
The World Cup 1992 triumph which still ranks as Pakistan 's crowning glory was built upon the basis of a bowling attack that literally worked on blowing away the opposition . The idea was that to take wickets was the only way to restrict a side , containment was not an option and was regarded as a negative tactic . This obviously meant the use of resources which could take the fight to the enemy and were not there to put in a hard-days ' work with sanitized lines and lengths .
In the world of attacking cricket , even spinners were front-line wicket-taking options . Mushtaq Ahmed demonstrated this in the most emphatic manner to the world in 1992 . Their performances during that competition possibly changed the role of the spinner in all forms of cricket . Slow-bowlers were now weapons of choice for captains and the world of cricket was richer for that idea .
The Pakistan 's Champions Trophy campaign in 2017 started off with a performance that literally brought tears of desperation to the eyes of their supporters . Imran Khan in comments after that game wanted their country 's team to approach each game with a will to win and not with thoughts of failure . The challenge for Mickey Arthur and Sarfraz Ahmed was to instill that spirit in their wards which they did with great success to take their team to the final of the tournament .
The tentative approach of the first game was replaced with an all-out attack by the bowlers in the do-or-die games against South Africa and Sri Lanka . The bowlers attacked the stumps and the batsmen in a manner which would have made the likes of Imran , Wasim , Waqar and Mushtaq proud of their successors . Mohammad Amir bowled with pace and accuracy and the yorkers from each of Junaid Khan and Hasan Ali were fired in with intent to take wickets . When Shadab Khan was asked to take their place in the team for the semi-final clash with England , they responded with a bowling performance which was not meant to save runs but took out arguably the best batsman England had on offer .
Similarly , Rumman Raees on their ODI debut during the game against England could have been excused to have looked to have bowled their quota of overs with a low economy rate but they did much more than that as they took two wickets which further eroded England 's chances of setting up a challenging total for Pakistan . The fact that the relatively unknown Hasan Ali who 's now the leading wicket-taker of the Champions Trophy can be credited in no small measures to their ability to attack with all their might to take wickets as and when needed by the team . The occasional loose ball is not a matter of concern as the aggressive right-armer has shown the watching world .
There is no doubt that the tradition of bowling with intent is one that is ingrained in the Pakistani bowling psyche but what is equally true is the fact that Pakistan have been most successful when they have gone in to a game with a plan to attack and not contain . This is the same quality which is now seeing a resurgence during the current tournament in which Pakistan entered as underdogs but now find themselves as finalists , much to the amazement of many cricket followers .
The 92 Cornered Tigers they are n't , but what the current Pakistan team has shown is that they are at their best with an aggressive captain at the helm and bowlers who have no thought for defence and containment . This revival in an attacking mindset could well see Sarfraz Ahmed and their team-mates lift the Champions Trophy at The Oval on Sunday .

ESPN Dolphins reporter James Walker describes the mistakes the team needs to correct ahead of a playoff matchup with the Steelers next week . ( 0:37 )
MIAMI GARDENS , Fla. -- It was an odd vibe inside the Miami Dolphins ' locker room Sunday evening . The team was heading to the playoffs for the first time in eight years , but no one was happy about it .
The Dolphins suffered a 35-14 blowout loss to the New England Patriots in a game that exposed many of Miami 's weaknesses . The Dolphins ' defense struggled mightily and their offense was sloppy and could n't get anything going consistently .
Make no mistake , this was a game Miami tried to win . That is why players and coaches alike took this loss probably harder than they should . Despite clinching a playoff berth a week ago , the Dolphins were full-go in their preparation and did n't rest their starters . Several on the roster also played through injury , and the playoffs were an afterthought until their mission against New England was complete .
But after Sunday 's failed mission and season sweep by the Patriots ( 14-2 ) , who are hands down the best team in the AFC , it is time for the Dolphins ( 10-6 ) to quickly turn the page and focus on their playoff opponent : the Pittsburgh Steelers .
“ We 're going to flush this one and get ready for Saturday or Sunday , ” Dolphins safety and captain Michael Thomas said . “ We 're still in here [ in the playoffs ] . So let 's go and get ready to play . The only part you want to remember is this taste , because at this point it 's single elimination . ”
The Dolphins were one of the hottest teams in the NFL until Sunday 's loss . They entered as winners of nine of their past 10 . But the Patriots and head coach Bill Belichick are experts at exposing weaknesses .
It is easy to dissect what New England thought of Miami based on its game plan . The Patriots attacked Miami 's shaky linebacking corps and lack of overall speed on defense . New England also prevented the big play from Dolphins quarterback Matt Moore , whose best throw is the deep ball .
According to ESPN Stats & Information , the Patriots blitzed Moore just four times in 34 attempts , while waiting for the offense to make a mistake . That came in the form of an interception from Moore and a fourth-quarter fumble by running back Damien Williams .
The Patriots are a team that usually does n't beat itself and provided a blueprint for other playoff teams of how to handle the Dolphins . Rest assured the Steelers will study Sunday 's tape of Miami , especially after they lost to the Dolphins 30-15 in Week 6 .
“ They were jumping a lot in coverage , forcing you to be patient , but at the same time , stopping the run game , ” Moore said . “ So they kind of had the best of both worlds there early on . ”
Perhaps the Dolphins may see the Patriots down the road for a third meeting . A win over Pittsburgh would set up another game between Miami and New England at Gillette Stadium in two weeks .
But while the Patriots rest , the Dolphins will have their hands full with the Steelers ' Ben Roethlisberger , Antonio Brown , Le'Veon Bell & Co . The Dolphins deservedly will be wild-card underdogs , especially after entering the playoffs with a whimper .
“ We 're still in here , '' Thomas said , while shrugging off Sunday 's loss . `` And there 's a whole bunch of teams that wish they were in the playoffs . ''

BEIRUT ( AP ) - An air raid has struck several cars in northwestern Syria , killing at least eight people , including al-Qaida-linked terrorists and a senior commander with a Chinese Islamic terrorist faction , an activist group and a local jihadi commander said Monday .
The attack occurred late Sunday on a road leading from the town of Sarmada to the Bab al-Hawa area on the border with Turkey , said the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights and a local commander with the Fatah al-Sham Front , an al-Qaida-linked group . The militant spoke via text messages on condition of anonymity because of security concerns .
It was not immediately clear who was behind the attack , but the Observatory 's chief Rami Abdurrahman said it is widely believed to have been carried out by the U.S.-led coalition .
The U.S. has killed some of al-Qaida 's most senior commanders in Syria over the past two years in airstrikes . Those targeted included members of the so-called Khorasan group , which Washington describes as an internal branch of al-Qaida that plans attacks against Western interests .
The Observatory said eight people were killed in the airstrike , including three jihadi commanders . The dead include a senior al-Qaida commander known as Khattab al-Qahtani , who was from the Gulf region and fought for the group in Afghanistan .
Abu Omar al-Turkistani , a top commander with the Turkistan Islamic Party , and a Syrian al-Qaida commander known as Abu Muatasem al-Deiri , were also killed . The Turkistan Islamic Party mainly consists of minority Uighurs from China , many of whom have traveled to Syria to help battle President Bashar Assad 's forces alongside other jihadi groups .
The Fatah al-Sham commander confirmed that several people were killed , including al-Qahtani and al-Turkistani . They said the attack was most likely carried out by drones .
A video posted online by the Syrian Civil Defense search-and-rescue group , also known as the White Helmets , showed rescue workers spraying a car with fire extinguishers as a body was removed and placed in a black bag . The video appeared genuine and corresponded to other Associated Press reporting .
Earlier Monday , Syria 's state news agency said al-Qaida militants knocked out electricity towers near the capital , causing power cuts in a southern province . SANA said Fatah al-Sham fighters bombed three towers southwest of Damascus , causing electricity cuts in the Quneitra region .
The report came as a cease-fire brokered by Russia and Turkey held for the fourth day amid sporadic violations . Fighting has raged in the water-rich Barada Valley northwest of Damascus over the past two weeks .
The Fatah al-Sham Front , previously known as the Nusra Front , and the Islamic State group are not included in the truce .
New Delhi : The Congress on Saturday accused the ruling BJP of indulging in political witch-hunt against opposition leaders in order to `` divert attention '' from its failures .
`` Political witch hunt , vendetta and malicious intent to seek revenge has blinded the Narendra Modi-led central government and the Manohar Lal Khattar-led state government in registering a series of criminal cases against Congress leaders across the country , '' Congress leader Randeep Singh Surjewala told media in New Delhi , a day after the CBI filed a charge sheet against former Haryana chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda in connection with a Rs 1,500 crore land deal case .
They said the case in which a charge sheet was filed by the Central Bureau of Investigation in a Haryana court was `` false and fabricated '' as the Manesar land was released on 24 August , 2007 , while the Khattar government filed the case after eight years against unnamed persons .
`` The charge sheet and false criminal cases being filed against the Congress leaders exposes the sinister hallmark of the Modi government 's style of functioning , '' Surjewala said .
Accusing the Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP ) of using the investigating agencies against opposition leaders , the Congress leader said , `` It is being done to divert the attention of the public from the real issues and the failure of the BJP government across the country . ''
`` A similar charge sheet was filed against former Himachal Pradesh chief minister Virbhadra Singh in a court by the Enforcement Directorate few days ago . ''
The Congress leader said the BJP was using the investigative agencies as `` captive puppets '' .
`` The CBI has truly become the BJP 's 'Captive Bureau of Investigation ' , '' they said .
Surjewala said the Congress party and its leaders will fight the `` conspiracies and the false cases '' with full vigor .
`` We will not be cowed down nor back down against the obvious attempts at seeking revenge and vendetta , '' Surjewala added .

ST. CLAIRSVILLE , Ohio ( AP ) — An Ohio woman might want to ask some questions if they try to borrow someone 's urine again to pass a drug test .
WTOV-TV reports 24-year-old Kiana Wallace was sentenced to 18 months in prison Monday , in eastern Ohio 's Belmont County , after submitting a borrowed urine sample that tested positive for drugs . Wallace pleaded guilty earlier this month to attempted tampering with evidence .
Judge Frank Fregiato called the failed urine swap “ bizarre ” and told Wallace they would n't allow them to make a mockery of the drug and alcohol testing system .
Records show Wallace was sentenced to six months in jail followed by probation in January 2017 for drug possession .
Wallace 's public defender declined to comment Tuesday .

OREGON STATE ATHLETICS ' EVERYDAY CHAMPIONS CULTURE
Through the power of sport , we help people discover and pursue their passions , talents and purpose in order to live a life of balance and positive contribution .
TORONTO – When Ayelet Freedman assigned their Grade 7 students to work on a math problem in groups last year , a 12-year-old girl said they were “ too stupid ” to work with my classmates .
“ She was n't looking for attention , they were convinced they were stupid , ” says Freedman , a math and language teacher in Ontario 's York Region .
So they pulled the student aside , assured them they are n't stupid and asked them to try to work with the other students , many of whom were chatty and confident about math .
“ By the end of the year they were more verbal and was participating more and was more confident , ” Freedman says .
Confidence in math has become a major problem for girls , research and data show . Experts believe it is one of the reasons women are vastly outnumbered by men in science , technology , engineering and mathematics ( known as STEM ) professions later in life .

Differences in math confidence between boys and girls show up as young as Grade 3 in Ontario , despite girls and boys scoring similar marks . That trend continues through to high school .
According to the Education Quality and Accountability Office ( EQAO ) standardized test in the 2016/17 academic year , only 49 per cent of Grade 3 girls in Ontario agreed with the statement they are good at math compared to 62 per cent of boys .
The difference widens in Grade 6 , where 46 per cent of girls said they were good at math compared to 61 per cent of boys .
“ These attitudes are very important – they are significant predictors of math-related career choices , ” says Mary Reid , a professor of math education at the University of Toronto 's Ontario Institute for Studies in Education who studies the differences between the sexes .

Some of the reasons are well known : stereotypes that perpetuate the myth that men are better at math and science while women are better at nurturing careers ; lack of female role models in a given field ; and problems at home , says Reid . But another reason that has gained research attention in recent years is what 's known as math anxiety , they say .
A seminal study in 2009 in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America showed American female elementary teachers passed on their anxieties about math to girls in their classes , but not to boys .
It is a vicious cycle , Reid says , because elementary school teachers in both the United States and Canada are overwhelmingly female . It 's about 90 per cent in the United States , according to that study . In Ontario , 83 per cent of elementary teachers are female , according to the most recent EQAO data .
Reid 's research shows there is a strong correlation between math anxiety and a teacher 's knowledge of the subject . According to the most recent EQAO results , 82 per cent of elementary teachers completed post-secondary education in an area unrelated to mathematics .

“ If you do n't know how to add fractions or the concepts behind them , how do you expect to teach that ? ” Reid says .
Reid says they spend a lot of time going over mathematics with student teachers in order to address that issue .
In April 2016 , Ontario announced a three-year , $ 60-million math strategy that puts an average of 60 minutes per day of “ protected math learning time ” in the curriculum for students between Grades 1 and Grade 8 .
The following year , only half of students in Grade 6 , and 62 per cent of those in Grade 3 met the provincial standard in math . The dismal results prompted Premier Kathleen Wynne to announce the province would look at overhauling its math education program .
In Quebec , students consistently perform the best in the country . Experts believe that is mostly due to stronger teachers who have to go to school for four years for a bachelor of education degree , and more math specialist teachers beginning in Grade 7 .

But it 's not just an issue for teachers , Reid says . Responsibility lay with every adult who deals with a child 's education , they say .
Gina Iuliano Marrello , the superintendent of student success at the Toronto Catholic District School Board , agrees .
At a recent meeting , Marrello said the board asked what they could do to help .
“ Try to be positive – all the adults , the trustees , the teachers , the parents – everyone can do it , ” Marrello says they told the board .
“ We hear people say all the time ‘ Do n't worry , I 'm no good at math ' – even adults say that and that has to stop . People never say ‘ Do n't worry , I was never good at reading . ' People would think that 's crazy . ”
We notice that when kids come into kindergarten , they do n't have that attitude , they say , but they fall into that and by Grade 6 their math ability is pretty low .
For Freedman , a young teacher just starting out , girls ' confidence in math is of paramount importance .

“ If girls want a job in science or architecture , for example , we have to encourage that confidence in math and find jobs to use those skills , ” they say .
Richards hoping Guitar Pete can play a better tune in Saturday 's Caspian Caviar Gold Cup Posted by racenews on Monday , December 11 , 2017 · Leave a Comment
There are 17 contenders going forward for the £120,000 G3 Caspian Caviar Gold Cup ( 1.55pm ) , the prestigious two mile and five furlong handicap chases staged on day two of The International at Cheltenham Racecourse , Saturday , December 16 .
The first four horses home from the G3 BetVictor Gold Cup , staged over a similar distance at The November Meeting , all go forward for the Caspian Caviar Gold Cup .
In last month 's contest , Splash Of Ginge ( Nigel Twiston-Davies , 10st 10lb ) came out on top by a neck from Starchitect ( David Pipe , 11st 5lb ) with Le Prezien ( Paul Nicholls , 11st 9lb ) another two and a half lengths back in third and Ballyalton ( Ian Williams , 11st ) fourth .
If successful on Saturday , Splash Of Ginge would become the ninth horse to win both the BetVictor Gold Cup and the Caspian Caviar Gold Cup but only the fourth to achieve the double in the same season following Pegwell Bay ( 1988 ) , Senor El Betrutti ( 1997 ) and Exotic Dancer ( 2006 ) .
Splash Of Ginge 's trainer could also be represented by Foxtail Hill ( 11st 4lb ) , who was eighth in the BetVictor Gold Cup but previously defeated Le Prezien by a neck in the two-mile Randox Health Handicap Chase at The Showcase on October 28 .
Cumbrian handler Nicky Richards is hoping Guitar Pete ( 10st 5lb ) has a clear run through the race after their performance in the BetVictor Gold Cup . The seven-year-old was detached in rear after being badly hampered at the first fence and did well to finish as a close they as did , 25 lengths behind the winner in ninth .
Guitar Pete was a live outsider for the BetVictor Gold Cup , having defeated Sametegal and Splash Of Ginge in a two and a half mile Listed handicap chase at Wetherby on November 3 .
Richards said today : “ Guitar Pete is in great fettle and will run in the Caspian Caviar Gold Cup .
“ The BetVictor Gold Cup was just a non-event for them really . They got badly hampered at the first and basically that was the end of the story .
“ I am quite sure they can be competitive on Saturday . They are tough little horse and should run a good race , provided they get that bit of luck you need in these big handicaps . ”
The weights are now headed by Clan Des Obeaux ( Paul Nicholls , 11st 12lb ) , who was the comfortable winner of a graduation chase at Haydock Park on November 25 .
Clan Des Obeaux 's trainer Paul Nicholls is the most successful trainer in the history of the Caspian Caviar Gold Cup with four victories . In addition to Clan Des Obeaux and Le Prezien , Nicholls could also be represented in Saturday 's contest by Romain De Senam ( 11st 2lb ) , who was fifth in the BetVictor Gold Cup .
A horse looking to bounce back to form is Kylmore Lough ( Harry Fry , 11st 11lb ) , who pulled-up when favourite for the BetVictor Gold Cup . Other interesting contenders include King 's Odyssey ( Evan Williams , 10st 11lb ) , who was travelling well when falling in this contest 12 months ' ago and Long House Hall ( Dan Skelton , 11st 2lb ) , not seen out since landing a Listed handicap chase at Market Rasen in July , 2016 .
The Caspian Caviar Gold Cup is part of a seven-race card on day two of The International , which also features the £130,000 G2 Unibet International Hurdle ( 3.05pm ) , a leading trial for the Unibet Champion Hurdle .
This contest has re-opened for entries until 11.00am tomorrow , Tuesday , December 12 , but is expected to feature The New One ( Nigel Twiston-Davies ) , who is seeking a fourth win the race following wins in 2013 , 2014 and 2016 . Also re-opened for entries until 11.00am tomorrow is the opening £20,000 JCB Triumph Trial Juvenile Hurdle ( 12.10pm ) , which went to subsequent G1 JCB Triumph Hurdle scorer Defu Du Seuil in 2016 .
Saturday 's programme also includes the £30,000 Junior Jumpers Handicap Chase over two miles ( 1.20pm , 13 entries ) which could feature 2014 Betway Queen Mother Champion Chase hero Sire De Grugy ( Gary Moore ) and the £30,000 G2 Albert Bartlett Novices ' Hurdle ( 2.30pm , 17 entries ) .
Completing the card are £25,000 Ryman Novices ' Chase ( 12.45pm , 13 entries ) and the concluding £30,000 OLBG Mares ' Handicap Hurdle ( 3.40pm , 21 entries ) .
It 's all fun and games until someone slams into a building , as Tom Cruise appears to have learned Sunday in London .
The movie star , known for doing their own stunts , was attempting to jump from one building to another while filming `` Mission : Impossible 6 . '' In a couple of videos obtained by TMZ , Cruise misses the mark at least twice , and comes up limping hard .
In what appears to be the more painful miss , the cabled-up 55-year-old runs off one roof , comes up short and slams into the target building . They then clambers up onto the second roof , favors their right leg as they limp awkwardly toward crew members , limps gingerly around on the roof and gives a wave to crew before he 's hauled back to the starting point by people TMZ describes as members of the `` MI : 6 '' safety team .
Another video , shot from the ground , showed a different attempt in which Cruise misses the second roof , hits the side of the target building and is immediately hauled back to the first building .
The extent of Cruise 's injury was unknown Monday morning .
Director Christopher McQuarrie ( who also helmed `` Mission : Impossible — Rogue Nation , '' which saw the actor hanging off of an Airbus A400 ) , told The Times in 2015 , `` Tom is very bold , but he 's acutely aware what any single injury would do to the production . Besides , no one wants to be killed by a seagull . ''
Cruise 's rep did not immediately respond Monday to a request for comment .
Most ambitious people spend their lives laser focused on becoming the best at one craft . The vast majority never reach the pinnacle of their respective field . According to the NCAA , only 1.5 % of college football players make it to the NFL . Chad Thomas wants to be added to that 1.5 % and some think they can take home music 's highest honor , too .
Former # Hurricanes DE Chad Thomas will soon play on Sundays , and has already produced beats for Rick Ross , Kodak Black & nearly one for Rihanna .
Meet the new kind of dual threat , @ MajorNine . One that @ DJSamSneak feels âis gon na win a Grammy.â # NFLDraft https : //t.co/6YEfytVcOJ pic.twitter.com/4oxmwYlsWg â Master Tesfatsion ( @ MasterTes ) April 23 , 2018
Thomas , who played DE and recorded 41 tackles for the Miami Hurricanes in 2017 , does n't see being the best in two fields as daunting .
`` They 'll never understand somebody doing something and being great at two things that require a lot of mental ability , a lot of strenuous hours , '' Thomas told Master Tesfatsion of Bleacher Report . `` They 'll never understand that because it ai n't easy to them . But it 's easy to me . ''
The 22-year-old producer/rapper , who goes by `` Major Nine '' in the booth , has both music and football in their blood . Thomas ' great uncle , Roger Finnie , spent 11 seasons in the NFL playing offensive tackle for the Saints , Cardinals , and Jets . At the age of three , Thomas ' grandmother taught them how to play the piano and from there they picked up a slew of other instruments including bass , acoustic guitar , drums , and trombone .
Their dedication to music has led to them producing songs for hip-hop chart toppers like Rick Ross and Kodak Black . Drake and DJ Khaled have sampled their production , too .
`` I 'm telling you right now . He 's gon na win a Grammy , '' said Sam Sneak , Ross ' official DJ .
Earlier this month , Thomas dropped their five-track EP , Lil Tape .

However , do n't make of the mistake of thinking Thomas ' time in the studio has hindered their performance on the gridiron . NFL.com analyst , Lance Zierlein , believes Thomas could be a second or third-rounder .
`` [ Thomas ] has all the physical and athletic traits that a team could look for along the edge and he 's versatile enough to play in an odd or even front , '' said Zierlein .
Back in March , NBA legend Kobe Bryant became the first sports champion to win an Oscar . Time will tell how far each of Thomas ' talents take him , but the first professional step in their football journey will likely come later this week .
The beginning of the John Stevens era was n't pretty . It was actually ugly in the final 20 minutes .
But compared against last season , the Kings will gratefully take a 2-0 win against the Philadelphia Flyers in their season opener Thursday .
Goalie Jonathan Quick looked to be in midseason form with a 35-save shutout that stood in polar opposite to their serious groin injury on opening night last season , which kept them out for four months .
Here 's what we learned :
The defense is ahead of the offense . After so much chatter about more offensive possibilities , the Kings never quite clicked aside from the fourth line of Kyle Clifford , Nick Shore and Trevor Lewis that produced their first goal .
Jeff Carter and Tyler Toffoli teamed for a goal as well , but there were too many broken-up plays and stoppages in the offensive zone and not enough extended pressure . The game had 73 faceoffs .
The Kings were reduced to playing defense in the third period , when Quick made 17 of their 35 saves . One aspect that concerned Stevens in the preseason was having the Kings take care of their own zone , and that appears to be a talking point going into their next game Saturday .
Alex Iafallo could be fun to watch . Iafallo 's perfectly placed pass to Anze Kopitar in the first period was an example of the type of skilled hands the Kings need .
Iafallo happened to be making their NHL debut , on the top line with Kopitar and Dustin Brown , and here 's guessing the rookie earned a stay for a little while .
Nolan Patrick was quiet . The highly-regarded Philadelphia rookie was kept under wraps . They had one shot in 14 minutes , 20 seconds of ice time , which included nearly five minutes on the power play .
But they and linemates Wayne Simmonds and Jordan Weal saw a lot of ice time against Carter 's line , and Patrick lost six of eight faceoffs .
“ I thought our top guys were really good tonight , ” Stevens said of shutting down Patrick 's line . “ I thought our defense played really solid . ”
It was only the second NHL game , in as many nights , for Patrick , the second pick in June 's draft .

An array of reptiles has been found in a home on Springbrooke Road in Cobourg following a fire just before 7 a.m. on Sunday .
Firefighters say among the reptiles , they found one of the world 's largest species of lizards , an Asian Water Monitor , which may be to blame for the fire .
“ There was one large lizard still left in the house running around and the firefighters managed to trap it under a couch , ” said Bry Loyst , director of the Indian River Reptile Zoo .
That 's when the Indian River Reptile Zoo came to the rescue . The owners said the five-foot-long lizard 's name was Tiny .

Occupants of the home said they had an electric heater running so firefighters suspect the lizard could have knocked it over , causing the fire .
“ It 's one of the longest and largest species of lizards in the world . So they can get up to I think the record is around 10-feet long , ” said Loyst .
But tiny was n't alone . There was were also two dogs in the home and a total of five reptiles kept in terrariums .
“ We found more reptiles than we were anticipating so we began to assist the reptiles out of the building and into a safe environment in our trucks , ” said Cobourg Fire captain , Chris Brown .

While Tiny the lizard is venomous and is capable of inflicting a poisonous bite , they are legal to have as a pet in the town of Cobourg , but illegal in places like Toronto or Peterborough .
“ When it comes to private dwellings , the town of Cobourg does not have any bylaws prohibiting the keeping of those types of exotic animals , ” said Brent Larmar , Cobourg 's bylaw enforcement officer .
The total damage caused to the home was about $ 375,000 .
As far as Tiny goes , they are still at the zoo and is waiting to be examined by the veterinarian because they are in rough shape following the fire .
The Arkansas LSC has decided to postpone the enactment of the controversial tech suit restrictions that were intended to begin on September 1 , 2017 .
This action taken Sunday night by the ASI Board of Directors represents a step back from the decision made in April by the Arkansas House of Delegates . That rule would have limited any swimmers age 12 and under from wearing technical suits at any ASI sanctioned meets , with the only exception being during the finals sessions of prelim/final meets .
A representative from the Arkansas LSC told SwimSwam that USA Swimming 's recent decision to hire a consulting firm to study the issue was a factor . “ We wanted to get this right and there were a lot of situations and details we were trying to anticipate while creating the wording to be added to our meet info and sanction requirements . During that process USA Swimming called asking some of the same questions we were asking amongst ourselves . Their decision to hire consultants to explore the topic made us feel that we should give them time to possibly come up with a national path of action that could avoid some of the complications that might arise from individual LSC 's creating their own sets of rules . ”
The Arkansas LSC Board of Directors will be reviewing the rule again in January to evaluate USA Swimming 's findings and to decide whether to move forward as an LSC if warranted .
# 5 Rohit Sharma returns , named as the vice-captain
Rohit Sharma has been named as India 's vice-captain . ​BCCI announced India 's 15 member squad for the upcoming ODI and T20 series against Sri Lanka on 13th August . The series includes five ODI matches and one T20 game.The selectors have made major changes in the ODI line-up and have picked the team eyeing the 2019 World Cup.The squad features some high profile omissions and also has some interesting selections . We look at the top five takeaways India 's ODI selectionIn Virat Kohli , India have found a long-term leader . Considering Kohli 's staggering consistency , they are sure to lead India for an extended duration . The issue India are facing is of the vice-captain of the team who will handle the reins of the team during Kohli 's absence.In the past , the selectors choose Ajinkya Rahane for this job , but currently , the Mumbai batsman 's place in the team is in question and hence they are n't the ideal candidate for the post of vice-captain.By naming Rohit Sharma as the vice-captain , the selectors have settled this issue . The right-hand batsman has led Mumbai Indians pretty well in the IPL and their batting at the top of the order in the last couple of years has been consistent.This also makes it clear that Rohit 's place in the ODI team is secure and they will directly walk into the playing XI after being out of action for some months due to injuries.​
Coimbatore : Yugo Kobayashi and Beautin Antony scored in either half as Chennai City and Aizawl played out a 1-1 draw in an I-League encounter on Saturday .
Aizawl were off the blocks quickly and took the lead in the 3rd minute of the match . Andrei Ionescu got past their marker on the right before getting into the box and squaring a good cross to pick out Kobayashi , who tucked a neat finish into the net .
Chennai responded reasonably well with a lion 's share of possession for the next 15 minutes .
Jesuraj 's teasing cross into the box from the right provided Edwin Vanspaul with a golden opportunity to head in an equaliser but they sent their header wide .
The home side had a lucky escape when Ionescu 's curled effort from outside the box struck the crossbar and went out at the half-hour mark .
Edwin held on to the ball inside the box before picking out the clever run of Charles in behind the defence but the midfielder lacked composure as they blasted the ball into the stands , summing up Chennai City 's first half .
David Lalrinmuana 's free-kick into the box from the left met Kobayashi 's feet but the woodwork denied Aizawl yet again .
Failure to convert chances hurt Aizawl as Chennai City snatched an equaliser in the 73rd minute .
Laldinliana 's failure to intercept a through-ball from Soosairaj allowed substitute Beautin Antony to drive into the box and slot the ball home .
Both teams failed to create clear-cut chances towards the end of the game and had to settle for a point as the referee brought the interesting match-up to an end .
Chennai City will host Mohun Bagan next on 7 February whereas the defending champions will fly back to Goa to clash their swords with Churchill Brothers FC Goa a day before .

NEW YORK > > Disney 's Maker Studios and Google 's YouTube are distancing themselves from a top YouTube star after they made jokes construed as anti-Semitic and posted Nazi imagery in their videos .
Felix Kjellberg , known online as PewDiePie , has the most popular YouTube channel , with more than 53 million subscribers . The Swedish YouTube star rose to fame by posting videos of them playing and commenting about video games . More recently , they branched out into non-gaming videos that show them performing skits , stunts or making jokes .
Disney , whose Maker Studios runs Kjellberg 's channels and network , said they crossed the line with some of their videos . One video from January shows two Indian men paid by Kjellberg to hold up a sign that says “ Death to all Jews. ” Kjellberg said the video was meant to demonstrate how far people will go if they get paid to do something , but they did n't think they would actually do it . Other videos show Nazi imagery in a satirical way .
In blog post Kjellberg said they were making jokes , but realizes now that they were offensive .
Kjellberg 's channel was already part of Maker Studios when the Walt Disney Co. bought Maker in 2014 for $ 675 million . Maker contracts with individuals such as Kjellberg to produce videos for various YouTube channels .
Kjellberg pulled the video showing the two men displaying the anti-Semitic sign , but it is excerpted in a Wall Street Journal video . Other videos still on the site show Nazi imagery being used satirically .
Maker Studios said in a statement that while Kjellberg 's channel is popular because they are irreverent and provocative , the studio is ending its affiliation with them because they went too far .
YouTube spokesperson Michelle Slavich said YouTube has canceled the release of the second season of Kjellberg 's reality show “ Scare PewDiePie ” and removed the PewDiePie channel from its Google Preferred advertising program , which aggregates top YouTube content for advertisers to buy time on .

Charli XCX has returned today with a new single . It 's called “ 5 In The Morning ” and can be streamed down below via Spotify .
“ 5 In The Morning ” follows “ Girls ” , their ( somewhat problematic ) collaboration with Rita Ora , Cardi B , and Bebe Rexha . It also comes after Pop2 , their 2017 mixtape featuring Carly Rae Jepsen , Tove Lo , and Mykki Blanco , and MØ . The new single is also presumably our first preview of Charli XCX 's official Sucker follow-up .
“ i am going to release a lot music this year . and a lot of videos . you 're gon na be so fucking sick of me , ” Charli tweeted .

China has been in talks with neighboring Afghanistan to help build a military base there , amid concerns about militants slipping into Chinese territory from the war-torn country .
The military camp is to be constructed in northeast Afghanistan 's remote and mountainous Wakhan Corridor , where witnesses have reported seeing Chinese and Afghan soldiers carrying out joint patrols . The report cited the Afghan Defense Ministry 's deputy spokesperson Mohammad Radmanesh as saying that officials from Beijing and Kabul had discussed the plan during talks in December last year in the Chinese capital but added that details were still being worked out .
“ We are going to build it ( the base ) but the Chinese government has committed to helping the division financially , providing equipment , and training the Afghan soldiers , ” Radmanesh said .
In response to inquiries about the reported plan , a senior Chinese Embassy official in Kabul would only state that Beijing was involved in “ capacity-building ” in Afghanistan .
The freezing , barren panhandle of land bordering China 's Xinjiang region is so separated from the rest of Afghanistan , the report said , “ that many inhabitants are unaware of the Afghan conflict , scraping out harsh but peaceful lives ” and retaining “ strong links ” with their neighbors in Xinjiang .
China 's involvement in constructing the Afghan military base comes as Chinese President Xi Jinping seeks to expand Beijing 's regional economic and geopolitical clout .
China is investing in the building of infrastructure in South Asia and may be seeking to provide security for its trade interests by engaging in the measures in flashpoint Afghanistan .
Reports have already said that the Daesh terrorist group , which has lost territory in the Middle East , is expanding its foothold in Afghanistan . That could pose a security threat to China 's economic interests .
The NATO 's US-led Resolute Support military mission in Afghanistan declined to comment on the report about the base in Wakhan Corridor .
Cliqz , the German developer of the privacy-focused browser of the same name , has acquired the tracker-blocking browser extension Ghostery and its development team from its creator , Evidon .
Partly owned by Mozilla , Cliqz will combine Ghostery 's technology with similar functions in its browser , but plans to continue development of the extension for other browsers too , it said Wednesday .
The sale will resolve an apparent conflict of interest for Evidon , which on the one hand provided the Ghostery extension to enhance privacy , and on the other sold aggregate information to businesses regarding which trackers users blocked . It will still obtain that aggregate information from Cliqz , but one step removed .
Sharing of aggregate data and the creation of user accounts are optional features of the extension .
The Ghostery antitracking tool has about 10 million active users worldwide , the companies said . One advantage of the acquisition that Cliqz touted is that it is based in Germany , a country with some of the strictest privacy laws in the world , which it said should provide better privacy protection for any data the company holds about its users .
While Cliqz sets about integrating Ghostery 's functions into its browser , it recommends adding the Ghostery extension to the Cliqz browser , or using the Ghostery and Cliqz extensions for Mozilla 's Firefox together . Cliqz offers beta versions of its browser for Windows , Mac , Linux , Android and iOS . The Ghostery extension is available for Chrome , Firefox , Edge , Internet Explorer , Safari and Opera , with some functions available in mobile apps for iOS and Android .
Finance Minister Arun Jaitley took on Manmohan Singh for their statement slamming Prime Minister Narendra Modi , and stated they were surprised that the Congress expected Modi to apologise , according to an ANI tweet .

Cory Schneider . ( Marc DesRosiers-USA TODAY Sports )
Well , it 's been a long December and there 's reason to believe maybe this year will be better than the last . Before the New Jersey Devils entered the final month of 2016 , they were clinging onto the second Wild Card spot in the Eastern Conference . All of the feel-good vibes carrying over from the 2015-16 campaign were still intact .
Then , the roof collapsed .
New Jersey 's defense became a sieve , the offense sputtered and their goalie became frustrated .
The Devils finished the month 4-9-1-1 . On the season , New Jersey is two games under NHL .500 , 14-16-7 ( 35 points ) and are 10 points out of a playoff spot . Conversely , the Devils are 10 points removed from having the top spot in the NHL Entry Draft .
Will the Devils turn it around in the 2017 portion of their schedule ? Would they be better off “ tanking ” the rest of the season and letting the kids play it out and develop ? With that , we look back , and ahead , to where the Devils are at and what 's in store for 2017 .
The Good
Travis Zajac
The longest-tenured Devil is the most consistent . The Devils center leads the club with 16 helpers and 24 points . On Dec. 1 in a 4-3 losing effort at Chicago , Zajac netted the second hat trick of their career . Perhaps an All-Star nod is in the works for the Winnipeg native .
Severson 's Offense
While the Devils defense has been porous , to say the least ( we 'll get to that below ) , Damon Severson has given the offense some jump . The former Kelowna Rockets defenseman leads New Jersey 's blueliners with 18 points and is sixth on the club in scoring overall . Severson is four points removed from surpassing their 2015-16 total of 21 .
Kinkaid Saves
While their final outing was rough , the Union College product was a breath of fresh air in a 2-1 shootout victory over the Washington Capitals on Dec. 29 . Following two consecutive three-goal thrashings at the hands of the defending Stanley Cup champion Pittsburgh Penguins , Kinkaid rallied the troops and made 43 saves to snap a six-game road losing streak .
Showing Some Muscle
After dropping seven straight , New Jersey decided to mix it up both literally and figuratively . Adding defenseman Seth Helgeson from AHL Albany and enforcer Luke Gazdic , the Devils threw off the gloves and threw their weight around . The Devils racked up 30 penalty minute against the rival Philadelphia Flyers . More helpful though were the four tallies and a shutout performance by Cory Schneider in a 4-0 victory .
The Bad
Road Woes
In December , the Devils went 2-4-1-1 away from “ The Rock. ” At 5-12-5 , New Jersey 's regulation road losses are tied with the Vancouver Canucks for the most in the league .
The Defense Rests Its Case
We 're reaching a tipping point where it may be fair to ask when the Devils make a change with how they coach up the defense . During the glory years , it was the likes of Jacques Lemaire , Larry Robinson and Jacques Laperriere working with the defensemen . As recently as two years ago it was Scott Stevens making an impact on the career of a young Adam Larsson .
New Jersey 's minus-28 goal differential is the worst in the Eastern Conference . On 13 instances this season , the club has yielded three consecutive unanswered goals in a game and that ca n't be tolerated going forward .
Sagging Power Play
Last season the Devils compensated for spotty five-on-five play with a superb unit on the attack . Fast forward and this squad is having issues capitalizing with the extra attacker . At 14.1 % , New Jersey ranks No . 27 in the league on the power play . During their final contest of 2016 against the Caps , the red , black and white went an abysmal 0-for-9 with a man up .
Looking Ahead
There 's no place like home after the holidays . That 's how the song goes right ? If the Devils are going to make a playoff push , it starts with home cooking in January . New Jersey is 9-4-2 at the Prudential Center and were 20-13-4 during the calendar year of 2016 .
The Devils begin the 2017 slate by hosting the Boston Bruins . Four of their first five contests will reside in the Garden State before the team embarks on a four-game western swing . Following that stretch , the Devils return home for three of their final five games in the month .
After months of speculation and debate , the Edmonton Eskimos have traded backup quarterback James Franklin to the Toronto Argonauts .
Franklin , who is a 2018 pending free-agent , goes to the Argonauts along with a third round pick in the 2018 CFL Draft in exchange for national offensive lineman Mason Woods .

Franklin spent three seasons with the Eskimos starting in three games posting a 2-1 record . Overall , Franklin made seven appearances throwing for 1,449 passing yards , 12 touchdowns and one interception . Franklin also recorded 148 rushing yards and scored one touchdown
Quarterback Mike Reilly is rumoured to be signing an extension at some point in the off-season , and winning the CFL Most Outstanding Player award cements their status as the Eskimos starting quarterback for the next several years .
That left little room for a return for Franklin despite the desire of general manager Brock Sunderland early in the 2017 season .
“ That 's the goal , ” said Sunderland at the time . “ We think the world of them as both a person and a player . We know they are highly coveted and they have earned that . We are happy they are an Eskimo and we want them to be an Eskimo long term . ”

( Reuters ) - Sri Lanka pace bowler Suranga Lakmal helped them steamroll India by seven wickets in the first one-day international in Dharamsala on Sunday .
The 30-year-old claimed four wickets for 13 runs in their impeccable 10 overs , which included four maidens , as the tourists bundled out India for 112 in 38.2 overs at the Himachal Pradesh Cricket Association Stadium .
India were reeling at 29-7 in the 17th over before Mahendra Singh Dhoni struck a belligerent 65 , with the former captain contributing more than half of the team total .
Sri Lanka 's top order were not completely convincing against the moving ball but Upul Tharanga 's breezy 49 helped them chase down the small target with nearly 30 overs to spare and go 1-0 up in the three-match series .
Smarting from their 1-0 loss in the preceding test series , Sri Lanka opted to field against an Indian team led by Rohit Sharma in the absence of regular skipper Virat Kohli who has been rested ahead of the team 's imminent tour of South Africa .
India got off to a terrible start losing Shikhar Dhawan , one of their five scoreless batsmen in the match , in the second over which triggered a spectacular collapse .
Angelo Mathews , an all-rounder who has been reduced by injury to an occasional bowler , dismissed Dhawan leg-before and Lakmal sent back Sharma caught behind for two in the fifth .
On both occasions , Sri Lanka used the review option to overturn the original not out decisions .
The double blow completely unhinged India , who lost the top half of their batting order to score their first 16 runs .
Dhoni combined with number nine Kuldeep Yadav ( 19 ) to help India first go past the record for lowest ODI total of 35 -- by Zimbabwe against Sri Lanka in a 2004 match in Harare -- and then their own lowest total of 54 against the Sri Lankans .
Dhoni hit 10 boundaries and a couple of sixes but India still ended up with a total which Sri Lanka overcame without breaking a sweat .
Mohali hosts the second ODI on Wednesday .

Unmemorable days are spent chained to computers and textbooks , waiting to the bat with childish abandon More
Buildings . Faceless and numerous . Plentiful . Boring . Buildings are boring . If there was one thing I could change about Mumbai , it would be the buildings . Not poverty or hunger . That would be too meaningful . Buildings .
All they do all day is stand there , not being parks . Old buildings look fed up , hunched over in narrow gallis , stained with acid rain and years of parasitic occupants . Newer ones look pleased with themselves ; smug . Bright and artificial , with their fancy clubhouses and promises of a better life . At night , they form constellations of shining lights in the distance– an image never forms .
Walking through the roads , the buildings swallow you whole , a fish-eye view of a world trapped by brick and concrete . It 's a sickness that grows with each passing day , being trapped between the buildings . In the years spent with every day more similar to the last , the streets grow narrower , the buildings larger , more cavernous and dangerous .
They eat you alive , the buildings . they feed on the repetition , the ambling life of dreams unfulfilled . Every frustrated scream not screamed , every thought of going away not lived is another day of substandard bliss . And yet , in this suburban patchwork of boring grey and hellish brown there lives a cure to the growing resentment of routine and habits of the place you lived and loved but never really lived at all : galli cricket .
My Eden Gardens lies in the undergrowth of Mumbai 's concrete jungle , tucked away behind the iconic Imperial Towers More
The buildings looked down upon me . Each one more daunting than the last , a virtual who 's who of the Mumbai skyscraper community . Antilla , check , Imperial Towers , check . Like stern parents , they strongly disapproved of the game I was playing . And every time a wind blew , they whispered , “ Galli cricket is for children ” .
The wind cooled warm nights and heated arguments in the vacant basketball court , but brought with it the cruel suggestion of rain . Games ran long into the nights , powered by malfunctioning lights and intense competition . The crack of a tennis ball leaving low-quality willow is unmistakable , the dangerous sign of a batsman hitting ripe form .
Nobody was safe in the confines of the court– from flying balls or thinly veiled sledging . Excuses are made to parents and girlfriends to stay that one game longer , to live in fantasy that one hour more .
Whatsapp groups with weird names and terrible jokes bring an oddball group of friends together . There is always the one who makes sure everyone comes , the one who is perpetually late , the one who will argue every time they are out and the one who nobody really knows . There 's customs and habits and rivalries that form and break with the whim of an impromptu draft pick .

LONDON - Pakistan and India may not have played a bilateral cricket series since 2012 but their cricketers will share a dressing room at far away Lord 's on Thursday .
The ICC Rest of the World XI Squad will take on the West Indies for a T20 International at Lord 's and the proceeds will be from the match will , as the ICC says , be `` used to redevelop the stadia in the Caribbean , which were damaged due to hurricanes last year . ''
Led by Shahid Afridi , the World XI squad also features Indian stars Mohammed Shami and Dinesh Karthik . Shami replaced Hardik Pandya , who pulled out because of a viral infection . Besides Afridi , Pakistan will be represented by Shoaib Malik . Pakistan and India last faced off in the ICC Champions Trophy last year . While India won the opening match , Pakistan won the final . World XI coach Andy Flower felt happy that Indian and Pakistani cricketers will share dressing room space for a noble cause .
`` Sport has been used as a vehicle for good in many instances in the past and this is one of those occasions , '' said Flower . `` The hurricanes Irma and Maria hit the islands of Anguilla and Dominica eight months ago so perhaps this is n't in the public consciousness as powerfully as it was back then . But after that happened , initially the West Indies Cricket Board and Giles Clarke talked together , and then the ICC and the MCC came together to put this event on to raise money to restore the cricket grounds in those islands . '' `` I 've been involved in these World XI charity events before as a player , and there 's usually a wonderful feel to it , '' they said . `` The feeling is generated because the intent behind everyone 's involvement is for good and you get some really amazing side benefits as well . For instance , here we 've got Pakistanis and Indians sharing a dressing room which does n't happen very often . ''
Pakistan and India have not played a bilateral series since 2012 due to political tension between the two neighbours .
The BCCI has repeatedly clarified its stance that it wo n't be able to engage in bilateral contests unless the government gives clearance .
It is understood that the richest cricket board wants a formal communication before they head to ICC Disputes Resolution Forum where they are set to counter PCB 's compensation claim of USD 70 million for not honouring the MoU , signed in 2014 .
`` The BCCI would be grateful if you could formally convey the policy/position of the Government of India on the need or requirement of prior clearance from the Government of India for the Indian cricket team to play the Pakistan cricket in in-bound or out-bound tours , '' BCCI recently wrote to the ministry .
The targeted shooting of Republican lawmakers at play yielded a kaleidoscope of emotions Wednesday — anger , revulsion , horror — but little in the way of surprise .
The attack almost seemed a natural , if sick , extension of the virulence that surrounds the country 's increasingly tribal politics .
As if to prove it , events quickly settled into a familiar pattern : finger-pointing , blame-laying , partisan positioning . People today do n't just disagree . They 've grown to hate the other side , from President Trump on down .
Not necessarily over issues or ideology , which can be debated or leavened by compromise . But rather as an outgrowth of a deeper pathology , a contempt toward people for merely existing .
“ It 's hard to suggest it 's an ideological conflict , ” as if , say , the abortion issue has suddenly grown more heated , said Marc Hetherington , a political science professor at Vanderbilt University . “ What it 's all about is bad feelings . ”

Former Toronto police chief and federal marijuana point man Bill Blair says Marc Emery is “ spouting complete nonsense ” after making a claim that pot makes people better drivers .
“ I have to tell you . I was a cop for 40 years and I ca n't tell you the number of times I 've heard a drunk tell me they drive better after he 's been drinking and we heard the same nonsense from a pothead , ” Blair said during an interview on Global 's The Morning Show on Tuesday .
Canada 's self-proclaimed “ Prince of Pot ” made the controversial statement on Monday while speaking to The Morning Show ‘ s Jeff McArthur .
READ MORE : Marc Emery claims smoking marijuana makes people better drivers
“ Remember , pot does n't impair you , ” Emery said . “ This idea , one of the many myths I have to clear out in the next 18 months , is that pots impairs you . Marijuana makes you more self-aware of your situation , so you 'll be a better driver if you smoke pot regularly . ”
Blair said studies have proven that marijuana impairs decision making , cognitive ability , memory and pyschomotor skills .
“ A recent Canadian study indicated that it increases the likelihood of being involved in an accident four-fold , ” Blair explained .
“ It clearly impairs a person 's ability to operate a motor vehicle in a different way than alcohol , but definitely the science is unequivocal and clear . ”

Blair maintains Emery 's comments goes against good public policy and the basis of evidence used to develop the federal government 's marijuana legalization bill .
“ Clearly Mr. Emery is an advocate and a profiteer . They have a self interest in this , ” Blair said . “ But that type of nonsense really does n't inform good public policy . We 'd rather rely on advice from experts and the science that is available on this . ”
Introduced last Thursday , the proposed legislation would allow adults 18 and over to possess up to 30 grams of dried cannabis or its equivalent in public , share up to 30 grams of dried marijuana with other adults and buy cannabis or cannabis oil from a provincially regulated retailer .
New penalties for offences would range from a simple police citation to 14 years behind bars .
The federal government said the plan is to have a legalized ​pot system in place by the end of June 2018 .

Cricket - Sri Lanka v India - Third Test Match - Pallekele , Sri Lanka - August 12 , 2017 - Sri Lanka 's Vishwa Fernando celebrates with their teammates after taking the wicket of India 's Ravichandran Ashwin .
PALLEKELE , Sri Lanka ( Reuters ) - Shikhar Dhawan smashed their sixth hundred and added 188 in an opening partnership with KL Rahul before Sri Lanka 's spinners fought back to halt the touring side 's progress in the third and final test on Saturday .
India reached the close of play on 329 for six , after losing no wickets in the first session , with Wriddhiman Saha unbeaten on 13 and Hardik Pandya not out on one at stumps .
After winning the toss and opting to bat , India captain Virat Kohli could not have asked for a better start as their side began their bid to complete a series whitewash over the hosts .
Following wins inside four days in Galle and Colombo , the world 's top-ranked side have opened an unassailable 2-0 lead and the injury-hit hosts face another stiff task against Kohli 's men in the finale .
On a surface ideal for batting , India 's openers picked up boundaries at will and made Sri Lanka pay for their profligacy with Dhawan given a reprieve on one , their edge flying through the slip cordon off left-arm seamer Vishwa Fernando .
The left-handed batsman went on to hit 17 fours in their 123-ball knock before they were out for 119 , hitting a sweep shot off left-arm spinner Malinda Pushpakumara straight to Sri Lanka captain Dinesh Chandimal at square leg .

Pushpakumara had also provided Sri Lanka a breakthrough in their first over when they dismissed Rahul for 85 . The 30-year-old , playing only their second test , later bowled an out-of-sorts Ajinkya Rahane for 17 , to end the day with figures of 3-40 .
A century once again eluded Rahul , who was dropped twice during their innings , as they were caught at mid-on trying to hit a lofted shot . It was their seventh consecutive score of 50 or more .

Left-arm wrist-spinner Lakshan Sandakan then got Cheteshwar Pujara ( eight ) to edge one to slip as Sri Lanka continued to fight back .
The 26-year-old , replacing the injured Rangana Herath , also removed the dangerous Kohli with the right-handed batsman out for 42 after getting an edge to slip .
Ravichandran Ashwin ( 31 ) was the only wicket to fall to the faster bowlers when they edged Fernando to wicketkeeper Niroshan Dickwella after the hosts had taken the second new ball .
Left-arm wrist spinner Kuldeep Yadav was the only change for the touring side , called up as a replacement for suspended left-arm spinner Ravindra Jadeja .
The hosts have been hurt by injuries throughout the series and will be missing both spin spearhead Herath and paceman Nuwan Pradeep . Middle-order batsman Dhananjaya de Silva was dropped after scores of nought and 17 in Colombo .
BAHAWALPUR-The Islamia University of Bahawalpur said it prioritised the hiring of PhD degree holders during the last two years and recruited 128 faculty members including professors , associate professors and assistant professors .
Vice Chancellor Prof Dr Qaiser Mushtaq during a meeting of senior officials at their office reviewed various administrative matters . They said that also the non-teaching departments at the university lacked professionals especially key administrative posts were being run on additional charge . The university recruited professionals on merit through widely circulated advertisements across the country .
Scrutiny and processing of 46,000 applications for non-teaching posts pending since 2013 were conducted . As many as 562 staff members long delayed promotions were promoted to next grade as only 73 employees were promoted previously , they said .
“ The conduct of 9 mega selection boards in a period of two years is also a record in university 's history as there were only five selection boards held during previous three years . There were no board of faculties in the IUB , these boards were established and regular meetings were organised during this two year , ” they said . The university also followed Punjab government 's recruitment policies for disabled persons and deceased employees , around 23 special persons and 50 widows or close relatives of decreased staff members , they said .
The university also hired PhDs through HEC 's Interim Placement of Fresh PhDs Programme to boost research activities , they said . In this way , 1,258 persons were hired and promoted purely on merit in both teaching and non-teaching departments , they claimed . The university also focused on training and development of employees and for the first time organised training sessions in collaboration with the Federal Education Ministry , Higher Education Commission and Punjab Higher Education Commission , they said .
The federal and provincial governments as well as educational circles have hailed the university 's efforts for ensuring merit-based recruitments . Due to these steps , the HEC has recently declared IUB on 6th position in 21 universities of Punjab for winning research grants . The university is currently on 11th position in general ranking of universities .
CHITTAGONG - A Malaysian ship carrying aid for thousands of Rohingya Muslims who have fled a bloody army crackdown in Myanmar docked in Bangladesh Tuesday , days after it met with protests in Yangon .
Senior Bangladeshi officials and Malaysian diplomats gathered at Chittagong port as Nautical Aliya docked in the southern city , from where its aid cargo will be transported to Rohingya camps .
The shipment was received by local officials of the Red Crescent and International Organisation of Migration at the port 's container terminal in a brief handover ceremony .
Trucks will carry the 1,472 tonnes of food , clothing and medical items to Cox 's Bazar , some 200 kilometres ( 125 miles ) south of Chittagong for distribution to tens of thousands of Rohingya refugees .
Bangladesh has allowed 25 Malaysian volunteers out of 183 people who came with the aid ship to travel with the cargo to the Rohingya camps in the southern district of Cox 's Bazar , the district 's chief administrator Ali Hossain told AFP .
Abdul Aziz Mohd Abdur Rahim , a representative of Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak and a member of parliament who travelled with the ship , called for a `` long-standing solution '' to the Rohingya crisis as they handed over the aid cargo . `` Thirty million Malaysians are with you ( Rohingya ) , '' Rahim said .
There was , however , no representative of the Rohingya community or any of the elders at the port . `` We hope our humanitarian efforts will pave the way to resolve the Rohingya issue and awaken the international community , '' Malaysian volunteer Azmi , who uses one name , told AFP . The ship initially planned to dock at Teknaf in southern Bangladesh , where almost 70,000 Rohingya have fled from Myanmar 's Rakhine state since October to escape the violence . It also tried to dock near the island of Kutubdia on Monday , but `` technical issues '' forced it to travel further north to Chittagong , chief administrator of the region Ruhul Amin told AFP .
Dozens of Buddhist monks and nationalist demonstrators last week protested the ship 's arrival in Myanmar 's capital , Yangon , with some waving national flags and signs reading : `` No Rohingya '' .
Myanmar denies citizenship to the million-strong Rohingya , despite many of them living on its soil for generations .
Tens of thousands have fled to neighbouring Bangladesh bringing harrowing tales of murder and rape .
Myanmar 's treatment of the Rohingya has sparked international criticism , including from Muslim-majority Malaysia - a rare spat between the Southeast Asian neighbours .
Myanmar initially refused to allow the ship into its waters and has barred it from sailing to Rakhine 's state capital Sittwe .
The Saskatchewan government is laying the building blocks of extended parental leave .
Earlier this year , the federal government introduced rules for 18-month parental leave in Canada . Before these benefits can be claimed they have to be authorized by the province first .
Saskatchewan has not yet made the necessary changes to the Employment Act to allow for the extended leave .

Labour Relations critic Nicole Rancourt introduced new legislation May 30 to bring the extended leave to Saskatchewan . The legislative session concludes May 31 , and Rancourt would have liked to see speedy passage .
“ It would be really easy to be able to put that forward right away , ” Rancourt said . “ If both sides of the house agree to it I do n't see why there should n't be a problem putting that forward as soon as possible . Because we do n't want to wait months . Families are going to be impacted . ”
Labour Relations Minister Don Morgan said that the government 's plan is to introduce the necessary amendment to the Employment Act in the fall session .

First , Morgan wants to complete a thorough consultation , which they said began “ months ago ” . In addition to extended parental leave ,
Morgan said other leaves are being discussed , including leave for critically ill adults .
“ We want to do a careful study , but the commitment that we made is we want to introduce a bill in the fall that will certainly deal with the extended mat leave , but may well be other things as well , ” Morgan said .
A bet is n't a bet unless you shake on it , right ? That is one lesson an Arizona Diamondbacks fan learned during Wednesday 's NL wild-card between the Diamondbacks and the Colorado Rockies .
During the bottom of the seventh inning , the Diamondbacks were hanging onto a 6-5 lead after coughing up a 6-0 early lead . With two runners on the bases and two outs , Diamondbacks manager Torey Lovullo decided to let their relief pitcher Archie Bradley go up to bat .
Usually when pitchers go up to bat , it 's expected as an easy out . One Diamondbacks fan was so confident that Rockies relief pitcher Pat Neshek would get the out that they placed an erroneous bet on Twitter .
And let 's see what happened .
An extended cut of Archie Bradley 's two-run triple in the NL wild-card Game , the first triple by a reliever in the postseason An extended cut of Archie Bradley 's two-run triple in the NL wild-card Game , the first triple by a reliever in the postseason SEE MORE VIDEOS
That was not just one but two runs on that triple by Bradley . It was the first triple by a relief pitcher in MLB postseason history .
Buss probably thought the tweet would n't attract attention , but it garnered so much attention that Bradley themselves took notice .
The official Twitter account of the Diamondbacks also poked fun at Buss and supported Bradley 's opinion .
Although they might not actually go forth with the bet , Buss is still in negotiations with Bradley over what they should do instead . One Twitter user commented that Buss should donate the money that it would cost to get the tattoo to Bradley 's charity of choice .
The Diamondbacks defeated the Rockies , 11-8 , and will take on the Dodgers in a best-of-five NLCS series starting Friday .

( Recasts with Barça report )
VILA-REAL , Dec 10 ( Reuters ) - Luis Suarez and Lionel Messi fired Barcelona to a 2-0 victory over 10-man Villarreal as the leaders won for the first time in three La Liga games to stay five points clear on Sunday while Atletico Madrid edged Real Betis 1-0 .
Barça looked set for a third consecutive league draw as they created scant opportunities but were presented with the advantage of an extra man when Villarreal midfielder Daniel Raba was given a straight red card for a wild , studs-up challenge on Sergio Busquets on the hour mark .
Barça did not take long to cash in and Suarez broke the deadlock in the 72nd minute , rounding goalkeeper Sergio Asenjo to complete a move of quick passes by Lionel Messi , Jordi Alba and substitute Paco Alcacer .
The visitors then stretched their lead nine minutes later with the help of a haphazard backpass from Victor Ruiz to Busquets , who played in Messi for their 14th league goal this campaign and round off the victory .
Barça leads the standings on 39 points , five clear of second-placed Valencia and six ahead of Atletico in third , while champions Real Madrid are fourth on 31 .
Earlier on Sunday a scrappy goal by Saul Niguez racked up a third straight victory in La Liga for Atletico , who scrapped their way to an unconvincing win at Betis .
The Spanish midfielder slid in at the back post to meet a low cross from Sime Vrsaljko to score the only goal of the game in the 30th minute , netting for the second game in a row .
Atletico were without talismanic forward Antoine Griezmann and only had two shots on target and 26 percent possession .
Diego Simeone 's side survived a huge penalty appeal for a shove by Angel Correa on forward Cristian Tello shortly before Saul 's goal while Atletico goalkeeper Jan Oblak pulled off an impressive save from former Barça forward Tello in the home side 's best attempt of the second half .

I 'm sorry that I mumble , ” Bill Dauster explained . “ Sen . [ Harry ] Reid and I always would talk to each other and he 'd say I mumble , and then they would go and mumble to other people , so I guess we had that in common . ”
Not long ago , Dauster could be found in a Capitol Hill office , dressed in a suit and tie as they wrote speeches , worked on policy and prepared for the next week 's Senate caucus meetings . But one day last week they turned up in an orange short-sleeve polo shirt at a café in Kensington , near where they and their wife live , ordered a large coffee , and in a low voice , chatted about their career on the Hill and how they reached across party lines .
Dauster , 59 , retired last month after a 31-year career in politics during which they worked on the staffs of four Democratic senators , including Reid , once the Senate majority leader . Dauster also worked on the Senate Budget Committee and had a short stint in the White House . Most recently they worked for Sen. Chris Van Hollen ( D-Md . ) .
Dauster said they decided to retire after President Donald Trump 's inauguration , when working on legislation became “ less fun. ” They had also reached an age when they could tap into their retirement savings .
“ I want to read the classics . I want to watch a lot of movies , maybe take some classes , ” they said . “ When we start talking about replacing President [ Donald ] Trump with somebody else , then I may pay attention again to what 's going on in Washington . ”
Dauster said as much as they enjoyed their decades in government , they grew increasingly frustrated by the lack of cooperation between Democrats and Republicans . To help cope , a dozen years ago they found a diversion : writing a Wikipedia entry for each of the 54 weekly Torah portions .
Dauster said the idea came to them after their boss at the time , Sen. Max Baucus ( D-Mont . ) , asked their staff to read New York Times columnist Tom Friedman 's bestselling book , “ The World is Flat , ” about how technology affects globalization . The chapter on Wikipedia captured their interest and they decided to have a look at the online encyclopedia edited by volunteers .
“ I said , ‘ Hey , they do n't have articles on the parsha of the week , ” they said . “ And so here 's a piece of real estate I can stake out and build . And so I 've written articles on the 54 parshiot , and I 've added a little bit every year since 2005 . ”
Dauster had studied Torah for a long time , first at Temple Emanuel in Kensington and now at Congregation Beth El of Montgomery County in Bethesda , where they are a member . So early in the 2000s when Tom Jones , a staffer for Sen. Jim DeMint ( R-S.C. ) , asked Dauster if he 'd like to join a weekly Jewish study group that met on Fridays in one of the congressional office buildings , Dauster accepted .
In addition to adding to their Jewish knowledge , the group helped Democratic and Republican staffers bond socially and work across the aisle .
“ I could ask Tom , ‘ What was Sen. DeMint thinking on this policy ? ' Or ask my friend in Sen. Portman 's ( R-Ohio ) office , ‘ Do you think we could work together on this project ? ' It does n't always work , but it gives you a way to start a conversation , ” Dauster said . “ Doing a job on the Hill is often not knowing the answer to the question , but knowing whom to call to find out what the answer is . ”
Jones said they always appreciated Dauster 's friendship during the sessions and referred to their friend as a “ scholar , public servant and patriot . ”
“ People ask me what is the quintessential Senate staffer , and it was Bill Dauster , ” they said .
“ You kind of run in your own universe when you 're on the Hill , so this is a way to meet smart knowledgeable people , ” said Jones , who now runs a consulting firm in Edgewater , outside Annapolis .
After Jones left the Hill in 2013 , Dauster took over organizing the study group , a labor of love which included putting together a weekly email with discussion questions about that week 's parsha . Staffers , Capitol Hill alumni and lobbyists were frequent visitors . Local rabbis came in to lead the sessions .
Dauster was raised in Sacramento , Calif . They became interested in politics in high school in the 1970s , when the Watergate hearings unfolded nationally on television .
“ This was one of the first times they televised congressional hearings , and I just watched them gavel to gavel , and was fascinated that the congressional branch was something that could provide a useful check on the president , ” they said . “ I wanted to do something like that . ”
They were the chairperson of the Student Senate at the University of Southern California , where they earned a bachelor 's degree and then a master 's degree in economics . They received their law degree from Columbia University in 1984 .
They came to Washington in 1986 and spent the first 10 years working on the Senate Budget Committee . In 1999 , they went to the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue and worked as President Bill Clinton 's deputy director of the National Economic Council for a year , before heading back to Capitol Hill , where they worked for Sen. Russ Feingold ( Wis. ) , as well as Baucus , Reid and Van Hollen .
Van Hollen praised Dauster with a statement that they read inside the Senate chamber last month when Dauster retired :
“ With a quote or a quip , [ Dauster ] has brought levity to serious policy discussion , ” they said . “ He has built a reputation as an honest broker , a brilliant dealmaker and an incredibly generous soul . ”
Dauster 's advice to people in their 20s and 30s is that a career in public service is worthwhile . For some , the best place to start may be in their own backyard .
“ If Washington turns you off , spend some time in Annapolis or Rockville or another jurisdiction for a bit , ” they said .
Dauster said the thing they are most proud of in their 31 years of government service is the passage of the Affordable Care Act in 2010 , which they worked on during their time on the Senate Finance Committee . With the law in jeopardy , Dauster hopes Trump and congressional Republicans ' efforts to repeal and replace it do not succeed . But if they do , Dauster said the Republicans are responsible for any negative repercussions .
“ There is a level at which Democrats would be happy if Republicans and Trump succeeded in repealing Obamacare , because then they would own the health care consequences , ” they said . “ But you do n't want that to happen because then 24 million people would not have health care . And there 's real pain and discomfort and shorter lives for a lot of people .

The Parti Québécois says there is a problem with English being spoken in Quebec workplaces . As Global 's Elysia Bryan-Baynes reports , the opposition party is hoping to table a bill that would limit employers ' ability to require English as a work skill .
On the same day their administration stopped accepting applications from so-called Dreamers for protection from deportation , President Trump on Friday welcomed Latino American leaders to the White House to honor their cultural heritage in observance of Hispanic Heritage Month .
In rambling remarks , Trump said the United States remains `` a beacon '' to people of other nations and lauded young attendees for the contributions they would make to the nation -- notes at odds with their restrictive immigration talk and policies , including the phase-out of the Deferred Action for Childhoood Arrivals program .
Trump did not mention their decision , which took effect at midnight , to shut down DACA . Since 2012 , the Obama-era program has given temporary legal status , for two years at a time , to some 800,000 people brought to the country illegally as children .
Nearly 90 % of DACA beneficiaries are Latino .
Nor did Trump take the opportunity to renew their call for Congress to act to make those protections permanent by writing them into law . As of Friday , the government stopped taking applications for new or renewed two-year work permits and deportation deferrals under DACA . Existing permits begin expiring on March 6 , 2018 .
At one point , Trump pointed to members of a youth orchestra from Miami and said , `` There is no task either large and no dream beyond your reach . ''
Trump also congratulated their administration , as they have many times , for `` doing a great job '' responding to Hurricane Maria 's devastation in Puerto Rico . `` We love Puerto Rico , '' they said , three times mimicking a Spanish accent to repeat the name of the U.S. territory .
Trump said the president of Mexico , Enrique Peña Nieto , called them on Thursday to thank the United States for sending rescue teams to help after a deadly earthquake that rocked Mexico City last month .
Their relationship has been tense since the 2016 campaign , given Trump 's adversarial rhetoric against immigration from Mexico and their demands that Mexico pay for a border wall . But Trump had kind words for Peña Nieto on Friday , telling the White House gathering , `` You have a wonderful president in Mexico , I can tell you that . ''

Following allegations that a candidate received questions in advance of the Saskatchewan Party debate in Weyburn , Alanna Koch is taking a stand against the accusations against them
“ This is an absolutely ridiculous accusation in which there is no truth . It is clearly an attempt to discredit my campaign , ” Koch said in a statement Monday .
“ I do appreciate the acknowledgement that I was very strong at the debate . However , if I had known the questions , I hope that I would have done even better . ”
“ I did well at the debate because for the past 10 years it 's been my job to know what is going on in government . ”
On Friday , it was reported that Tina Beaudry-Mellor , Gord Wyant and Scott Moe signed a letter asking for a review because they believed the debate questions were leaked to another candidate .

Patrick Bundrock , executive director of the Saskatchewan Party , confirmed that the letter had been received and that the matter had been handed off the Leadership Election Organizing Committee ( LEOC ) for investigation .
Koch also said they hope the results of the review come quickly .
A new Saskatchewan Party leader will be chosen at a convention in Saskatoon on Jan. 27 .
The Extraordinary Life of Ethiopia 's 93-year-old Singing Nun

I 'm no great singer , but Emahoy Tsegué-Maryam Guèbrou only really trusted me after I had sung to them “ Something from your country , ” they instructed . So I found myself in the tiny bedroom of this 93-year-old Ethiopian composer-pianist-nun , croaking my way through the verses of a Robert Burns song .
Given they do not agree to most interviews , I felt I should do what I was told . The room , at the Ethiopian Orthodox church in Jerusalem , was cramped and sweltering . In it was a small bed , an upright piano draped in Ethiopian flags , stacks of reel-to-reel and cassette tapes , and a jumble of handwritten manuscripts . On the walls were portraits of Emperor Haile Selassie – Emahoy knew them in the 1930s – and their own paintings of religious icons . The door was propped open and , from the courtyard , came smells of food and the sound of monks chanting .
Emahoy is fluent in seven languages , but when I finished the Burns song ( Ae Fond Kiss ) they admitted the old Scots lyrics had been tricky to decipher . I gave them a potted translation – lovers meet , lovers part , lovers feel brokenhearted – and they gripped my arm and fixed me with one of their deep stares . “ We ca n't always choose what life brings , ” they said . “ But we can choose how to respond . ”
If anyone is qualified to dish out such wisdom , it 's a woman whose choices were determined by religious self-exile , maverick gender struggles and Ethiopia 's dramatic 20th-century political history – and who became a singular artist in the process .
Most people familiar with Emahoy 's music come across it via their solo piano album released in 2006 , as part of the Éthiopiques collection . That series put their poised , bluesy , freewheeling waltzes together with the Ethio-jazz that emerged out of Addis Ababa in the 1960s – and although they smile fondly at the mention of fellow Éthiopiques musicians such as Mulatu Astatke and Alemayehu Eshete , they insist she 's not a jazz artist . Them training is purely western classical ; their inspiration comes from the ancient modal chants of the Orthodox church . It 's a unique fusion and it sounds like nothing else .

NEW YORK : An engaged couple were removed from a United Airlines flight to Costa Rica , as the airline remained under scrutiny following outrage caused by a video last week of a passenger being forcibly removed from a flight .
According to the couple , who said they were en route to get married , a federal marshal had escorted them from the plane before take-off from Houston , Texas , but United denied this on Sunday , saying in a statement that neither a marshal nor other authorities was involved .
The couple `` repeatedly attempted to sit in upgraded seating which they did not purchase and they would not follow crew instructions to return to their assigned seats , '' United said in a statement , adding `` They were asked to leave the plane by our staff and complied . ''
The statement from a United spokesperson said the airline offered the couple a discounted hotel rate for the night , and rebooked them on a Sunday morning flight .
But Michael Hohl and their fiancée , Amber Maxwell , told KHOU they tried to pay for upgraded seating and were denied , after finding another passenger sleeping across their seats when they were the last to board .
After moving within the economy cabin a few rows up , flight crew denied their request to pay a supplement for the seats , which United sells as `` economy plus '' , and told them to move back to their original seats , Hohl said . `` We thought not a big deal , it 's not like we are trying to jump up into a first-class seat , '' Hohl told KHOU . `` We were simply in an economy row a few rows above our economy seat . '' The airline suffered a public relations disaster after a video emerged a week ago showing security officers dragging a bloodied passenger off an overbooked United Express flight in Chicago . Shares in United 's owner , United Continental Holdings Inc , were hammered , dropping 4 percent last week to close at $ 69 on Thursday , reducing the company 's market cap by $ 770 million to $ 21.5 billion . Markets were closed on Friday .
Dr. David Dao , the 69-year-old Vietnamese-American doctor who was seen in video being dragged off a United flight a week ago , will likely sue the airline , their attorney said on Thursday .
After the incident triggered international outrage , United Chief Executive Oscar Munoz apologized to Dao , their family and its customers , saying the carrier would no longer use law enforcement officers to remove passengers from overbooked flights .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Wall Street put a floor under global equities on Friday after a weak inflation reading brought investors back into U.S. stocks even as tensions between the United States and North Korea continued to escalate , though the geopolitical fears still drove safe-haven buying of gold and the yen.Wall Street put a floor under global equities on Friday after a weak inflation reading brought investors back into U.S. stocks even as tensions between the United States and North Korea continued to escalate , though that tension still drove safe-haven buying of gold and the yen .
A small rise in a measure of U.S. consumer prices pointed to benign inflation that could make the Federal Reserve cautious about raising interest rates again this year , which would be favourable to equity investors .
The hope that the Fed will have to slow its rate-hike path appeared to stop , at least for now , the near $ 1-trillion loss in world stocks valuations this week triggered by the war of words between Pyongyang and Washington .
`` The slight bias to the upside ( in stocks ) is a result of the CPI number . The market is interpreting it as lowering the odds of the Fed raising rates in December , '' said Keith Lerner , chief market strategist at SunTrust Advisory Services in Atlanta .
Reuters data show a 22 percent perceived chance for a rate hike after the Fed 's December meeting .
Japanese markets were closed for a holiday , but the tense mood dragged Asian shares lower and an MSCI index of stocks across the globe .MIWD00000PUS posted its largest weekly drop since the week before Donald Trump won the U.S. presidential election in November .
Trump issued a new warning to Pyongyang on Friday , saying in a tweet : `` Military solutions are now fully in place , locked and loaded , should North Korea act unwisely . ''
North Korea had responded to Trump 's previous promise to unleash `` fire and fury '' with a threat to land missiles near the U.S. Pacific territory of Guam .
The Dow and S & P 500 inched higher on the day but they both posted their largest weekly percentage drops since late March .
`` There 's not a great incentive to buy big , '' said Lerner of SunTrust Advisory . `` You 're less than 2 percent off the high for the S & P heading into a weekend where uncertainty with North Korea still lingers . ''
The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 14.31 points , or 0.07 percent , to end at 21,858.32 , the S & P 500 .SPX gained 3.11 points , or 0.13 percent , to 2,441.32 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 39.68 points , or 0.64 percent , to 6,256.56 .
The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index .FTEU3 lost 1.01 percent and MSCI 's gauge of stocks across the globe .MIWD00000PUS shed 0.26 percent for a weekly loss of 1.6 percent , the largest since the week to Nov. 4 .
Emerging market stocks .MSCIEF lost 1.27 percent . MSCI 's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan .MIAPJ0000PUS closed 1.47 percent lower .
South Korea 's KOSPI .KS11 fell 1.7 percent on Friday to its lowest since May 24 , but its losses for the week were a relatively modest 3.2 percent .
`` Pretty remarkable , perhaps even extraordinary , considering , '' said Tim Ash , strategist at fund manager BlueBay .
A Reuters Datastream index of more than 7,000 stocks across the globe saw its market capitalization drop from a record high $ 61.36 trillion on Monday to $ 60.43 trillion at the close on Thursday .
Many world stock markets have hit record or multi-year highs in recent weeks , leaving them vulnerable to a selloff , and the tensions over North Korea proved to be the trigger .
The yen on Friday added to a strong weekly rally against the dollar of close to 1.5 percent , hitting its highest versus the greenback in almost four months , at 108.73 yen .
The yen tends to benefit during times of geopolitical or financial stress as Japan is the world 's biggest creditor nation and there is an assumption that Japanese investors will repatriate funds should a crisis materialize .
The Korean won KRW=KFTC continued to fall versus the dollar , down 0.13 percent to 1,143.5 on Friday for a 1.6 percent decline on the week .
The dollar was further weighed down on Friday by the soft U.S. inflation data .
`` If the data continues to come in on the softer side , the market might start to price the Fed staying on hold this year , '' said Sireen Harajli , FX strategist at Mizuho in New York .
The dollar index .DXY fell 0.32 percent , with the euro EUR= up 0.42 percent to $ 1.1819 .
Sterling GBP= was last trading at $ 1.3007 , up 0.25 percent on the day .
The Japanese yen last strengthened 0.03 percent versus the greenback at 109.22 per dollar JPY= .
In bond markets , the yield on U.S. Treasuries fell , also pressured by the lowered expectations for a Fed move .
`` There are four more ( inflation ) prints between now and the December FOMC meeting and we expect the Fed to remain data-dependent , if a touch more cautious , '' TD Securities said in a research note .

The 30-year bond US30YT=RR was last up 4/32 in price to yield 2.7871 percent , from 2.794 percent late on Thursday .
After touching a more than two-month high at $ 1,291.86 , spot gold XAU= last added 0.2 percent to $ 1,288.81 an ounce . Its weekly gain of 2.6 percent is the largest since June 2016 .
Ongoing global glut concerns lingered in oil markets despite a bigger-than-expected draw in U.S. crude inventories , leaving prices volatile .

Brad Bird 's long-awaited “ Incredibles 2 ” is set for a theatrical release in China on June 22 . The franchise 's first installment was released worldwide in 2004 and in China in 2005 .
“ Incredibles 2 ” is produced in 2D and 3D versions by Pixar Animation Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Pictures . Revenue sharing imports of Hollywood films are handled in China by state-owned distributors .
Unusually for China , the film is expected to be screened with a Pixar-made short film ahead of the main feature . The short , “ Bao ” which means bun in Chinese , is a story of a lonely Chinese mother and a steamed bun .
The timing puts the China release a week behind the North American outing on June 15 , and some Asian territories including Hong Kong , Singapore and The Philippines on June 14 , but still in the first wave of releases . The film does not play in the U.K. until July 13 , and in Japan until Aug. 1 .
Disney has also secured a date for the film before the traditional summer blackout period when only Chinese-language films are allowed fresh releases . Depending on the number of local films seeking slots , the blackout period can last from mid-July to mid-August . Local sources say that over 100 local and foreign titles will open in Chinese theaters between June and the end of August .

“ Incredibles 2″s English-language voice cast is a starry lineup including : Samuel L. Jackson , John Ratzenberger , Sarah Vowell , Craig . T Nelson and Holly Hunter in returning roles . Catherine Keener , Isabella Rossellini , and Sophia Bush appear as new characters . Bird voices the Edna Mode character .
Disney has enjoyed growing success in China with its animation titles , though not always with Pixar-made pictures . Walt Disney Pictures ' “ Zootopia ” earned a massive $ 235 million . Last year “ Coco ” obliterated Pixar 's record in the Middle Kingdom with $ 189 million . Another benchmark is Illumination Entertainment 's “ Despicable Me 3 , ” which last year grossed $ 158 million in China .
In a completely different era for Chinese box office , “ The Incredibles ” was released in Jan. 2005. and earned RMB20 million . At exchange rates prevailing at the time that was $ 2.4 million .
With major policy disruptions — structural changes like the goods and services tax ( GST ) , demonetisation , and an insolvency law ( with last month 's amendment ) — and big economic governance tools ( recapitalisation of banks , and greater order through a transparent auctioning of natural resources , disinvestment and steady economic growth ) behind it , Finance Minister Arun Jaitley , in the Modi government 's penultimate election Budget , puts the policy upheavals of the past three years together . Budget 2018 picks up the pieces of this apparently random policy jig-saw and binds it into a political economy narrative . This is a politically-sensitive Budget that consolidates past policies but also looks at and invests in a new future for the Indian economy .
The consolidation has two parts . The first captures the gains of the past . A 29 percent jump in the number of new taxpayers to 8.6 million in one year is no mean feat . Nor is the 28 percent increase in the number of effective taxpayer base to 82.7 million in two years . These are the benefits of demonetisation . Likewise , the formalisation of the Indian economy is now visible : Although the GST was ushered in only on 1 July 2017 , the process of entering the tax system has been `` massive '' . Both these policies use technology and finance to make tax evasion a risky business . Catalysing these are banks , with their balance sheets now powered by bonds worth Rs 80,000 crore . The gains from these policies are now being consolidated on two large and troubling frontiers in Budget 2018 — agriculture and infrastructure .
In agriculture , the direction is towards doubling farmers ' incomes by 2022 . That is , to step away from production-centric policies to productivity-focussed ones . With the minimum support price of most Rabi crops engineered to deliver a 50 percent return on investment to farmers already in place , Budget 2018 transposes it on the rest of the crops for the Kharif season as well . But prices are only one component of returns . Often , it is the middlemen , the traders , who pocket the benefits meant for farmers through the statutory agricultural produce market committees ( APMCs ) set up by state governments . Lack of access prevents small and marginal farmers who comprise 86 percent of all farmers from getting the benefits meant for them .
By linking technology and trading portals e-NAM ( electronic national agriculture market ) to create platforms for transactions , Budget 2018 proposes to offer small farmers the facility to make direct sales to consumers and bulk purchasers . This is part of a long evolutionary process that would give lower prices to consumers and higher returns to farmers . Being under the control of state governments , however , its success will depend upon on-ground execution in local mandis rather than in statements of a Union Budget document .
As far as Budget 2018 goes , the focus on agriculture is sending out a sharp political message too . The message is : 'Dear farmers , the BJP has plans of prosperity for you . '
The first big test of this message will come in April-May 2018 , when Karnataka goes to polls for 223 Assembly seats , and which will be a hugely-contested electoral battle . Before this , three smaller states — Meghalaya , Nagaland and Tripura , with 60 seats each — will have elections , soon after the Budget , in February-March 2018 . The end of the year will see elections in another small state , Mizoram , in October-November 2018 for 40 seats . In 2019 , as many as 11 States will have elections . This is not counting the big one — the Lok Sabha elections . Each of these elections will be hard fought .
The success of BJP will , consequently , depend on the delivery of agricultural policies , particularly in ensuring farm incomes rise . This will be a double-edged sword : If incomes rise , votes may follow ; if not , they will definitely go the other way . The agrarian focus of Budget 2018 , therefore , contains high risk as well as potentially high returns .
Coming to infrastructure , the journey will be steeper , given the huge monies involved . Budget 2018 estimates it to be Rs 50 lakh crore , though other approximations place the number as high as $ 1.5 trillion or Rs 95 lakh crore . Making matters worse is the complexity of contracts in the sector , which have ensured that allegations of corruption and nepotism accompany almost every closure . It would be wise to remain cautious about their execution at such a large scale . Again , since the devil of `` make or break '' lies in delivery , we hope technology would be able to resolve much of these pains , given , of course , that the policy path is clear in one sector after another , from roads and ports to railways and airports .
It would be the same story of past caution and future technology hopes around building cities . Of the Rs 200,000 crore outlay for 99 Smart Cities , for instance , projects worth only Rs 2,350 crore or 1.2 percent have been completed , while Rs 20,852 crore or about 10.4 percent are under progress . True , speed kills and often breeds corruption , a malaise this government has remained far from thus far . So , the slower speed may express circumspection rather than inertia . Further , unless executed with a new round of political enthusiasm and administrative energy , bundling tourism into the cities programme is a yawn — every minister in every government has attempted to turn tourist cities into revenue streams and failed . Will Budget 2018 be able to change this ? Unless the accumulated good intentions of the past 70 years come together and convert themselves into action , this will remain a grand strategy that would be read , analysed and repeated but not executed .
There are changes in taxation that will deliver outcomes . Firstly , the extension of a 25 percent corporate tax rate to companies with a turnover of up to Rs 250 crore . This will positively impact 99 percent of all companies filing tax returns ( in their previous Budget , Jaitley had given this benefit to companies with turnovers of up to Rs 50 crore or 96 percent of all companies ) . Jaitley hopes this will nudge beneficiary companies into investing and creating jobs , neither of which is pre-ordained . But the relief being provided to small companies is real and tangible . More than money , this relief can be seen as an incentive to go legit , to pay taxes and to help them negotiate the `` losses '' from two digital enablers of a formal economy — demonetisation and GST .
The Rs 7,000 crore of revenue foregone on this count will be pulled out of Jaitley 's second change , the reintroduction of long-term capital gains tax on equities and equity mutual funds , from which they hope to garner Rs 20,000 crore . All capital gains till 31 January 2018 , however , will be grandfathered .
The justification for a long-term capital gains tax is terribly weak : `` Return on investment in equity is already quite attractive even without tax exemption . ''
Through this statement , Jaitley is implying that these gains will remain attractive in the future too . That is not possible unless the Indian market becomes an unrelenting outlier , beating all past valuations and going in only one direction , up . What Jaitley is not seeing is the other side of returns — risk . What they should have done instead , and which Parliament must debate and push for , is to increase the definition of `` long-term '' for equities to three years from 12 months , as in real estate .
On the income taxes front , barring two tiny changes , Budget 2018 delivers what it must — status quo . That is , no change in either the rates of taxation or the slabs on which they would be applicable . Jaitley , however , has reintroduced standard deduction — which former Finance Minister P Chidambaram had removed 12 years ago , in Budget 2005 — of Rs 40,000 , for salaried taxpayers . This , they say , brings a little balance between the salaried taxpayers and the business or professional taxpayers ( in 2017-18 , 18.9 million salaried taxpayers paid an average of Rs 76,306 as taxes , while 18.8 million business or professional taxpayers paid an average of Rs 25,753 ) . The number of Rs 40,000 is about 26 percent short of the Rs 50,553 differential . The effective savings will be statistically insignificant , but nobody 's crying .
In a small way , Budget 2018 is shifting India towards a future that has already happened , to embrace a forthcoming digital life . By tasking NITI Aayog to launch a programme that brings India at par with the global economy in general and artificial intelligence , machine learning , internet of things , block chain technologies , 5G and 3D printing in particular , it is powering extant schemes like 'Digital India ' , 'Start Up India ' , and 'Make in India ' with knowledge . What India needs is an ecosystem that nurtures innovation , ideas and products that match the best in the world . This ecosystem can also work to strengthen the country 's defence system and catch up with the leaders — notably , the US , China and Russia .
The days of Budgets being policy statements and media events are over . Budget 2018 does what it is supposed to : Balance the books ; the fiscal deficit target of 3.5 percent for Financial Year 2018 and 3.3 percent for Financial Year 2019 are in the right direction , give or take — while driving growth .
With its focus on farmers and the poor ( the National Health Protection Scheme that would cover 500 million citizens in 100 million vulnerable households with a health cover of up to Rs 5 lakh for secondary and tertiary care hospitalisation ) , its politics is clearly aimed at the 17 state elections over the next two years and the 2019 general elections .

Confederate battle flags flew above I-26 Monday morning as two members of the South Carolina Secessionist Party held a demonstration on Aviation Avenue .
Party Chairman James Bessenger said it was in response to a recent news conference held by the National Action Network . It was also to put pressure on lawmakers , they said .
`` A little bit of this has something to do with trying to remind the legislature to keep their promise , '' Bessenger said . `` When they took the flag down in 2015 , the same legislation said the flag would go in the Confederate Relic Room and it 's been two years later . We want to see that happen . ''
Bessenger issued a news release early Monday morning in which they condemned remarks made by Pastor Thomas Dixon of The Coalition at a Sunday afternoon news conference .
In the release , Bessenger called Dixon 's remarks as `` the foulest form of hatred '' and claimed Dixon said of South Carolinians and other southern states who revere the Confederate flag that `` we can not treat them as if they are humans . ''
Dixon responded Monday afternoon , saying the party took their words out of context . Dixon said they were comparing hate groups , not Confederate flag supporters , to terrorists .
At Sunday 's news conference , Dixon criticized President Donald Trump for not referring to the white nationalist group as terrorists .
`` He will not call out racist white supremacists , '' Dixon said . `` Why is that ? Are they terrorists ? In my humble opinion , driving a car into a crowd of innocent people is no different than flying an airplane into a building full of innocent people . A terrorist is a terrorist no matter what the weapon of choice is . And our president did n't have the guts to stand up and call terrorists exactly what they are : terrorists . ''
Dixon said the woman killed at a rally in Charlottesville , Virginia , was `` mowed down for standing on the street expressing their free opinion . ''
`` This is America , '' Dixon said . `` An America where we are better than what we saw yesterday displayed , we are better than what we 've seen in our communities displayed , and we are better than what we see every Saturday and Sunday right here on this Battery displayed , when the South Carolina Secessionist Party comes here with Confederate battle flags and hoist them up on public property as if they are some kind of symbol of pride and unity , when really , they are symbols of terrorism , just as we saw in Charlottesville , Virginia , yesterday . So it 's time to remove the flag that they rally behind from the public landscape of America once and for all . At home or in a museum , but not on America 's public streets . And no more permits for rallies . The evidence against treating them like civilized humans became clear crystal clear yesterday . We ca n't treat them as if they 're humans . Terrorists do n't get permits in America like law abiding citizens do . ''
Bessenger said in the release there is no record whatsoever of the Secessionist Party or any of its members being involved in any violent protests or altercations during its existence .
The men waving the Confederate flags were on the overpass for about an hour .

When hundreds of activists on the left and the right converged here Saturday , things got ugly very quickly .
It was billed as a “ free speech ” rally by conservative activists , staged in one of America 's most liberal cities . But even before the event was set to begin , fists were flying and people were left bloodied . In the end , 21 were arrested and police confiscated an array of heavy sticks , knives , and Pepsi cans used as projectiles .
But what appeared to be a political event that devolved into violence was actually something more complex . The combatants on both sides were extremists who traveled from far and wide to make Berkeley their stage . Many freely admitted they were there to make trouble and that peaceful protest over President Trump and other issues really was n't their goal .
Much of the violence was captured on cellphone cameras and posted on social media , where each side offered supporters their narrative of what happened .
“ People have to start throwing [ things ] in order to protect themselves , ” said a feminist demonstrator who called themselves Emily Rose as they and their bloodied companion caught their breath during the heart of Saturday 's protest .
Them face was masked in a black-and-red bandanna , their small hands encased in black gloves on which was strapped a vial of pepper spray . Moments later , they were punched in the face during a fight with Nathan Damigo , a Cal State Stanislaus student , Trump supporter and founder of white nationalist organization Identity Evropa .
Alt-right organizers and the anti-fascist groups that oppose them have battled online and in person for a year , fueled by Trump 's rise and the reaction to it . Both sides increasingly are coming to blows across the country , notably last year in Sacramento and a few weeks ago in Huntington Beach .
For reasons political and geographic , Berkeley has become a particularly common battleground .
Uncertainty and disillusionment in the current political climate has caused “ a deeper tectonic shift within political extremes , ” said criminal sociologist Brian Levin , director of the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at Cal State San Bernardino .
“ They will glom themselves onto a tax day rally , a Trump rally , but there is a subgroup of extremists on both sides who are angling for a street battle , ” Levin said . Replayed to their audiences on social media , “ it goes viral . ”
Saturday 's demonstration was advertised as a “ Patriot 's Day ” rally by the Liberty Revival Alliance , promoted on Facebook but for which there was no permit . It was held at the Martin Luther King Civic Center park , nearly adjacent to the city police station . Nearby bank ATMs were boarded up and the downtown Starbucks restaurants , attacked during earlier battles , were evacuated .
The confrontation began two hours before the event and consisted largely of pushing and shouting matches interlaced with brief clashes of violence , pepper spray assaults and explosives . The attendees represented a spectrum of neo-conservative and alt-right groups , including members of the para-military group Oath Keepers from as far away as Missouri , followers of the Proud Boys and those with openly anti-Semitic and neo-Nazi slogans .
Several hundred counter-demonstrators showed up , including feminists , and those who identified with By Any Means Necessary and various anti-fascist organizations that have a stronghold in the Bay . Large numbers of demonstrators wearing black masks massed under the red-and-black flags associated with socialist ideology .
Similar confrontations occurred in Berkeley in March and in February , when demonstrators were able to shut down a planned speech by now-defrocked far-right commentator Milo Yiannopoulos .
The extremist groups have been around for years .
“ But now it 's burst out in multiple places , ” said Heidi Beirich , director of the Intelligence Project for the Southern Poverty Law Center , an advocacy group that monitors and opposes hate crimes . “ This is entirely new and there 's been a ton of it lately , and it seems to be out of control . ”
The environment on college communities is especially heated , they said , and the center is advising student affiliates on how to avoid being drawn into confrontations they said are largely geared for generating publicity .
“ Do n't even get near them , ” they said . “ Hold your own positive event , maybe on a different day . ”
The escalation in Berkeley causes concern among some of the college town 's establishment .
“ To the extent Berkeley is supposed to be representative ( of liberal movements ) we are being used , ” said David Gottfried , part of a small group of local residents who set up an “ Empathy Tent ” at the edge of the demonstration and encouraged the shouting masses to consider listening and dialogue instead .
It wound up being hit by pepper spray .
“ There was hardly anyone from Berkeley there , except of course the police , ” said Gottfried , a self-employed artist who , at 58 , is roughly twice the age of most of the combatants ignoring the tray of chocolates they held out .
Gottfried worried that the product of the day would be an escalation of extremism .
Tim Mueller , 50 , was the lone farmers market merchant who kept their tables of organic vegetables and beef open during the Saturday demonstrations as an act of defiance and political statement .
“ I 'm not willing to cede the space to… to this , ” they said , munching on a carrot as explosives went off down the street . “ It 's testosterone poisoning on both sides . They come here to just start a fight . ”
Nearby , AJ Alegria , 31 , of Sacramento ran from the crowd , blood streaming from their face , blinded by pepper spray .
“ Ultimately the goal is to stop this and get back to dialogue , ” they said . “ I thought we could pacify them , stop them. ” They admitted to using their fists , “ after they hit first . ”
Damigo , the alt-right leader seen in videos and photos punching Emily Rose , was not among those arrested by Berkeley police . Their Identity Evropa recruitment activities at Cal State Stanislaus have raised previous concerns . Campus administrators released a statement this week saying they were investigating their role in the Berkeley brawl .
“ The university has zero tolerance for the use of violence and we will take all of the necessary legal and disciplinary measures to ensure that all students and everyone on campus have a safe and secure environment , ” university President Ellen Junn said .
Damigo could not be reached for comment Monday .
Most arrested Saturday were from the Bay Area , but some accused of battery came from Palmdale and Huntington Beach , according to a list police released Monday .
The Council of Higher Secondary Education ( CHSE ) Odisha officials have confirmed that CHSE Plus 2 Results 2018 for Arts and Commerce will not be declared today , a report in Times Now said .

Officials from the board confirmed that CHSE Odisha Plus 2 results for Arts and Commerce have been delayed and are expected only in the first week of June .
State School and Mass Education minister , Badri Narayan Patra was quoted as saying that the result will be released in the first week of June . `` We are yet to publish the results of Plus 2 Arts and Commerce . The results are getting delayed due to manual entry of marks . Besides , there were various disruptions during the examinations this year , starting from management to evaluation of answer sheets . Last year , it was published on 30 May while it will be delayed by five to seven days this year . The results will be out by the first week of June , ” Patra said , according to Odisha TV .

The CHSE Plus 2 examination was conducted from 6 to 29 March .
The Angels have n't scored a run since last week . Accordingly , they lost , 3-0 , to Houston on Monday at Minute Maid Park .
In their last 20 innings since Saturday in Kansas City , the Angels have no runs on seven singles . In their last 46 innings , the Angels have just two extra-base hits . And , in their last six games , the Angels do n't have a win .
After a weekend series sweep to the Royals , Monday night 's defeat began more auspiciously . Mike Trout shot a two-out single to left in the first inning , then took second base on a missed pickoff . Kole Calhoun was hit by a Charlie Morton pitch , but C.J . Cron flied out to center .
Then , with two outs in the second , Danny Espinosa slid into first base to avoid pitcher Charlie Morton 's tag as they sprinted down the line . Martin Maldonado singled , and Espinosa took third . Yunel Escobar loaded the bases for the Angels ' No . 2 hitter , Ben Revere . They flied out while Trout waited on deck as the inning ended .
Revere is the least powerful hitter in the major leagues and has a career .320 on-base percentage , but Scioscia has hit them second in recent days .
Trout led off the third with a single and stole second when Calhoun struck out looking on a 3-and-2 fastball . C.J . Cron reached on catcher 's interference , Andrelton Simmons replaced them on a fielder 's choice groundout , and Jefry Marte lined out to third to end the inning.In the fifth , Trout worked a one-out walk , and Astros third baseman Marwin Gonzalez flubbed Calhoun 's potential double-play ball . That put two men on for Cron , who , again , flied out to center .
The Angels ' lineup managed only five singles and two walks against Morton and three Astros relievers . The middle of the Angels ' order was missing Albert Pujols , who had previously agreed with Scioscia to take Monday off .
After a scoreless first inning , Angels starter Jesse Chavez yielded back-to-back singles in the second . Escobar threw away the first single , allowing Evan Gattis to take second base . So , Gattis scored on Alex Bregman 's subsequent single . Angels catcher Martin Maldonado easily threw out Bregman stealing second , which proved important when Chavez issued consecutive walks to Marwin Gonzalez and Yulieski Gurriel .
Chavez permitted another run in the third on two singles and a sacrifice fly . They withstood further Astros ' attacks for four more innings to turn in their second solid start in three tries . In relief , right-hander Yusmeiro Petit allowed a run on back-to-back doubles . Second baseman Danny Espinosa threw out Jose Altuve , the latter doubler , to aid the Angels ' attempts to escape the inning .

JAKARTA , Indonesia ( AP ) — Unofficial counts indicate the acrimonious election for governor of the Indonesian capital will proceed to a second round in April with no candidate getting more than 50 percent in Wednesday 's vote .
Most of the quick counts carried out by research companies gave a slim lead to the incumbent Gov . “ Ahok ” Tjahaja Purnama , a minority Christian whose campaign was hurt by blasphemy charges , over Anies Rasyid Baswedan who courted conservative and hard-line Muslims .
Agus Harimurti Yudhoyono , the son of former president Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono , was in a distant third place that eliminates them from the contest .
The election campaign was married by shows of intolerance that undermined Indonesia 's reputation for moderation .
Religion and race , rather than the slew of problems that face a car-clogged and sinking Jakarta , dominated the campaign and transformed the election into a high-stakes tussle between conservatives , who want Islam to be ascendant in politics and society , and moderates .
Ahok 's chances appeared dashed after blasphemy accusations led to criminal charges and trial but they have recently rebounded in opinion polls . If convicted , they face up to five years in prison .
Analysts say it will be difficult for them to win the second vote if the Anti-Ahok camp unites behind the remaining Muslim candidate .
Ahok had been popular because of their drive to eliminate corruption from the Jakarta administration and their efforts to make the city more livable . But brutal demolitions of some of the slum neighborhoods that are home to millions and ill-considered outspokenness proved to be their Achilles ' heel .
Opponents seized their moment last year when a video surfaced of Ahok telling voters they were being deceived if they believed a specific verse in the Quran prohibited Muslims from electing a non-Muslim as leader .
In today 's rumor rundown the Carolina Hurricanes just made a trade for one of their defensemen almost a guarantee with the signing of Calvin de Haan on Tuesday . Who will it be ? Also , it looks like there is a frontrunner for Erik Karlsson 's services and a surprise team might be leading the charge . The Rangers have a decision to make on Kevin Hayes and
Carolina to Make Moves
After landing top-four defenseman Calvin de Haan in free agency , the Carolina Hurricanes must have something else coming . Of the many teams that needed another defenseman , Carolina really was n't one of them so the expectation is that with Dougie Hamilton , Justin Faulk , Jaccob Slavin , Brett Pesce , Trevor van Riemsdyk ( an RFA ) , young pros Haydn Fleury and Roland McKeown , and elite prospects Jake Bean , Luke Martin , and Adam Fox all on the roster , someone is moving . Logic would suggest that someone is Justin Faulk .
Luke DeCock suggests the Hurricanes now have their top four defensemen signed for the next three seasons at $ 19.3 million per season and Faulk is n't in that group .
One of the biggest surprises of the off-season is that the NHL Entry Draft and the opening days of free agency have passed and Carolina still has n't moved at least one of Jeff Skinner or Faulk . The signing of de Haan allows new GM Don Waddell to make a move .
Chicago is a team rumored to be putting a package together .

Dallas Stars the Favorite for Erik Karlsson ?
We talked yesterday about teams being granted permission to speak with Karlsson about an extension . This came after the Ottawa Senators offered the elite blueliner an eight-year contract that was not well-received . NBC Sports ' Kathryn Tappen reported that the Senators ' offer was for eight years at $ 10MM per season and Karlsson is looking for Drew Doughty and John Tavares money .
As teams reach out , it appears a frontrunner has emerged , that being the Dallas Stars . The Athletic 's Chris Stevenson has heard from a source that Dallas and Ottawa are well into talks about a trade for Karlsson but one that does not include Bobby Ryan .
Shapiro believes that any deal for Karlsson would have to include young defenseman Julius Honka , while Ottawa may be asking about Esa Lindell . But , that would n't be all . More names like Miro Heiskanen , Radek Faksa , Devin Shore , Valeri Nichushkin , and Riley Tufte , or a combination of these players could be part of the deal as well .

Kevin Hayes for Jake DeBrusk ?
Obviously , this is just one person speaking hypothetically , but New York Posts 's Larry Brooks believes New York Rangers restricted free agent center Kevin Hayes would be worth $ 30 million over five years on the open market and the Rangers are trying to decide if they should offer them something in that range or move them for other help .
Brooks thinks it would be a mistake to go through arbitration and see a one-year deal come out as a result . They ask if the Bruins would consider moving Jake DeBrusk for Hayes ?
Oilers to Move Zack Kassian ?
With a cap hit of $ 1.95 million , Zack Kassian is being viewed in Edmonton as a player the team potentially ca n't afford since other options are out there in free agency that would cost less to acquire and they had a rough season in 2017-18 .
Speculation is the Oilers would trade Kassian for a pick and then sign another forward or two to replace him . The names being tossed around are Jason Chimera , Nick Shore , Anthony Duclair or Scottie Upshall .
Delia Real Padilla
January 15 , 1930 – June 12 , 2017
Delia Real Padilla passed away in San Diego Scripps Hospital on June 12 where they had been recovering from an unfortunate accident . In their last days , they were comforted by their sons , daughter , nephews , nieces , grandchildren and family friends .
Delia was born in Somerton , Arizona during one of the family farmworker migrations that landed the Real family in Brawley in 1922 . Them parents were Dolores Molina and Santiago Real . They were the youngest of a large family , who migrated from San Jose Del Cabo and Loreto , Baja California Sur where their father , Santiago , was a fisherman and pearl diver .
Delia was a believer , rebel and an artist . They were the first in their family to graduate from Brawley High School in 1948 . In another era , they would have been able to accept the art scholarship facilitated by art teacher Barbara Jernigan , but the culture of the time frowned on Mexican girls leaving the home unmarried . So , the rebel in Delia eloped and married Joe Padilla , at Gretna Green soon thereafter .
Them artist soul continued in their children and grandchildren whom they inspired with their unending doodles , sketches – never forgetting their love of pastel colors on a black canvas . They said their dad had inspired that love of unreal color when they would speak to them of the colors they saw on their pearl-seeking sojourns beneath the waters of Baja .
The other Santiago memory was Delia recalling their childish mean streak , when they rode their cotton sack in their “ playground , ” the Valley picking fields . Delia would always regret the memory of grandpa carrying their extra weight on top of the heavy canvas burden .
Delia , like their husband Joe , considered themselves a public servant . After Joe returned home from the war , Joe and Delia married and the marriage lasted for 63 years until Joe passed away in 2014 . They settled in Brawley and raised four children .
Both Delia and Joe felt the need to participate in local community activity . At their parish , Our Lady of Perpetual Help , Delia was a member of the Altar Society . In addition to serving the church , they were active in the Brawley American Citizens Club women 's auxiliary where they participated in Get Out the Vote campaigns , and voter registration , sometimes driving East Side voters to the polls early into the night .
The example taught their children not to fear political engagement but to embrace it . They would brag that all their children became public servants- in local or state law enforcement , as a poverty law attorney , as a school teacher and administrator and as a school board member .
Local musicians will remember Delia 's love for music- Javier Solis and boleros- and the duet “ Los Dos ” sung with Joe at the ACC or Hidalgo Hall whenever they asked . Delia never forgave Joe for causing them to miss a Solis concert in Mexicali once , but they also never forgot having met the famous Mexican actor Pedro Infante , as a teenage ticket seller at the Eureka Cinema .
Delia is survived by their children Jose , Armando , Irene and Eddie ; their spouses Deborah , Patsy , Carlos and Vivian ; their grandchildren Alexis , EJ , Jade , Dados , Michael , Nick , Cherrisse , CJ , Patrick , Dominick , and Nicole and 16 great-grandchildren . They are also survived by their sister , Clara Delgado and numerous nephews and nieces .
The wake/rosary to celebrate Delia 's life will be held on Wednesday , June 21 , at Frye Chapel at 6 p.m. Mass and services will be held on Thursday , June 22 at 10 a.m. at St. Margaret Mary Church located in Brawley . Burial will follow immediately at Riverview Cemetery .
The family respectfully asks that in lieu of flowers donations be made in Delia 's name to California Rural Legal Assistance , Inc. , to support the rights of farmworkers throughout California . Donations can be sent to CRLA , Inc. at 449 Broadway , El Centro , California , 92243 .

By Representative Leon Young
After nearly 26 years of service to the citizens of the City of Milwaukee and the 16th State Assembly District , I have made the extremely difficult decision to retire . Difficult only because I will miss the countless residents who have entrusted me to serve them and fight for their improved quality of life through the years . The current state of partisan politics and sheer gridlock at the state have made this choice a little easier .
Through my tenure , I have been unyielding in the fight for affordable and adequate housing , employment for youth and adults , improved public safety through sponsored legislation on gun control , assault weapons bans , micro-stamping , stolen cars , driver 's license , etc .
Given the challenges this city and nation are now facing as it relates to community police relations , I have made the decision to return to where my professional career of service began , with the Milwaukee Police Department .
The past two and a half decades of addressing the needs of residents and fighting for the community have equipped me well to be placed in a unique position to aid in ushering in much-needed improved community police relations . With the change in leadership at the Milwaukee Police Department now is the perfect time for me to give of my time and talents to make lasting change on the issue of Public Safety in the city that is so dear to me .
I look forward to the next generation of leadership for the district . I wish my colleagues well in the continued fight to make Wisconsin great for all .
To the residents of the 16th State Assembly District , it has truly been an honor to serve each of you and I am eternally grateful for and humbled by your support through the years .

LAHORE - The value-added textile industry has asked the government to clear all the verified sales tax refunds of exporters ( under the PM Package ) before the end of its tenure as the shifting of this burden to the interim government will cause frustration among the exporters .
Pakistan Hosiery Manufacturers and Exporters Association ( PHMA ) chairperson Dr Khurram Anwar Khawaja added that billions of rupees against previous Drawback of Local Taxes and Levies ( DLTL ) Order 2009 since 2011 ; Incremental DLTL Order 2014-15 since June 2015 ; Incremental DLTL Order 2015-16 since April 2016 ; Incremental DLTL Order 2016-17 since April 2017 and DDT under PM Export Package 2017 of exporters are pending with the present government causing liquidity problems to the exporters in keeping up their export commitment , which must be released before May 31 to streamline the cash flow .
They said that GSP window had opened tremendous opportunities by way of inflow of abundant export orders which the industry would not be able to execute if liquidity problem of the industry is not resolved at the earliest .
They asked the government to appreciate the role of value-added apparel sector for its potential to harvest maximum benefits of GSP Plus , providing mass employment to the jobless population of the country .
Dr Khurram Anwar Khawaja said the benefits of the renewed GSP Plus status can only be harvested by maximum value-addition in finished products rather than exporting only raw materials , which can not be possible without relaxation in import policies .
They urged that the government to immediately clear the verified duty drawback tax claims submitted to the Federal Board of Revenue under the Prime Minister 's export package before the expiry of current government term .
They said that verified sales tax refunds of billions are stuck up , which should be cleared by the present government before May 31 , as handing over this matter to the interim government would cause further delay , creating hurdles in exports promotion .
They demanded the government to accord priority to exports over imports . They proposed that separate examination areas of exports consignments for inspection of goods at Terminals must be allocated .
The Patriots are on the road again this week as they head south to Miami for a Monday Night Football showdown against another AFC East rival . As the Patriots prepare for Week 14 , they will have to prepare for Rob Gronkowksi 's absence and maintain focus on this week 's game , all while trying to win another division title .
1 . How will the Patriots handle Gronk 's absence ?
The game plan definitely changes without Gronk . The roster officially lists veteran Dwayne Allen and rookie Jacob Hollister as the only other two tight ends . Allen and Hollister will have to step into big shoes this week .
Even without Gronk , the Patriots usually seem to find a way to get it done . Gronk was absent from countless games last season due to injuries and they found a way to win the Super Bowl .
Gronkowski will serve their one-game suspension on Monday night for their hit on Tre'Davious White last week . This is seemingly great news for the Dolphins defense , since they do not have to double-team the beast that is Gronk . But with the 5-7 Dolphins struggling , that news may not matter one way or the other .
The Patriots will continue to rely on the wide receiver corps , including Danny Amendola , Brandin Cooks and hopefully a healthy Chris Hogan . The running game will be important as well as the Patriots will try to get Dion Lewis , James White and Rex Burkhead rolling down field .
2 . Could this be a trap game for the Patriots ?
The Patriots defeated the Dolphins in Foxboro 35-17 just two weeks ago . The Patriots were 5-5 scoring touchdowns in the red zone , Tom Brady threw four touchdowns , the running backs amassed nearly 200 yards and the defense forced turnovers and kept the Dolphins running game in check .
But the Dolphins play well against the Patriots in Miami . The Dolphins are coming off a huge win against the Denver Broncos . This puts momentum back on Miami 's side to play well at home .

The Patriots will face their biggest game of the season next week against the Pittsburgh Steelers . Although the Patriot Way is one game at a time , they may still be thinking ahead .
3 . The Patriots could become AFC East champs
The Patriots can become AFC East Division champions for the ninth straight year by beating the Dolphins on Monday night . That would also be their fifteenth straight road win .
The Indianapolis Colts could always do the Patriots a solid and beat the Buffalo Bills on Sunday , which would also lock the division .
We 've all had instances where something we do is completely misinterpreted and we unintentionally make someone feel uncomfortable . It even happens when we think we 're expressing our love for our partner and then it totally backfires . It 's nothing to be embarrassed about , but figuring out boundaries and things that make your significant other uncomfortable is worth discussing .
Talking about boundaries upfront in a relationship is extremely important : it maintains a sense of mutual trust and respect , and can avoid putting either person in an awkward situation . If you have a conversation with your partner when you first start dating them about what makes you both feel uncomfortable or claustrophobic , you are much less likely to run into these problems in the future . It 's important to be direct , and ask them about likes , dislikes , and what really puts them out of their comfort zone .
The truth is , creepiness is completely subjective : everyone has different boundaries , especially when it comes to relationships and intimacy . What could make one person slightly uncomfortable , might make another feel loved . At the end of the day , off-putting actions all boil down to lack of communication or miscommunication .
Here are seven things that seem lovable but can actually be interpreted as creepy in relationships , according to a relationship expert .
1 Always Taking Pictures of Them , Even When They Are n't Aware Andrew Zaeh for Bustle When people take pictures with their partner , it 's usually a good thing : a photo is a permanent way of cementing a memory . But when that becomes taking photo of instead of with your partner , they might feel like their privacy is being violated . `` Sneaking around corners and hiding behind trees to get shots of your partner because you love them and want those candid moments , you 're not going to come across as a caring partner , '' relationship advice expert April Masini , tells Bustle . To avoid crossing boundaries , always just ask if they 're comfortable first , before snapping away .
2 Hanging Out With Their Family Members Without Telling Them bernardbodo / Fotolia Everyone has a different relationship with their family , some tenuous , others tender . When one assumes they know their partner 's protocol when it comes to communicating with their family members , they can cross a line without even realizing it . Masini says that there is an unspoken boundary around family , that for some , is easily crossed . For example , hanging out privately with your partner 's family members without mentioning ahead of time may cross that unspoken boundary — and impact your relationship . When it comes to familial matters , it 's always better to be safe , than sorry . Consult your partner first , before making plans .
3 Constantly Posting About Them On Social Media Andrew Zaeh for Bustle There 's no reason to hide , or feel shame around sharing how happy you are with your partner . But just because someone feels comfortable frequently posting the intimate details of their relationship online does not necessarily mean their partner feels the same way . `` Sharing personal images and news about your partner , or even just sharing your own feelings about your partner , publicly , is creepy when it 's in excess — or beyond your partner 's comfort zone , '' Masini says . Ask your partner about their social media etiquette before imposing yours — that way , they know their feelings are being taking into consideration .
4 Logging Into Their Phone Or Computer When They 're Not Looking Andrew Zaeh for Bustle Respecting your partner 's privacy establishes trust , whether that means not reading their diary or not skimming their DMs . While you might not personally feel protective of your technological space , you should n't assume the same for your partner . `` When you 're snooping on your partner 's phone or computer , you 're crossing the line of normal and safe , '' Masini tells Bustle . `` Instead , address the issue directly with your partner . '' Avoid attempting to guess passwords and awkward lock-out conversations by respecting their right to their own devices .
5 Showing Up Unannounced When They 're Out With Friends lordn / Fotolia Not everyone loves surprises , even if you do . While it might seem spontaneous to drop by your partner 's plans , it does n't take into consideration your partner 's space — maybe they needed a night alone with their friends . `` If you show up unannounced , you 're behaving as if your presence trumps their privacy and their relationships , '' Masini says . `` If you feel left out , discuss this with your partner , privately . '' When other people 's time is taken into account , perhaps it 's always easier to ask ahead , rather than going with your gut .
6 Making Future Plans Without Consulting Them First Ashley Batz for Bustle When it comes to daydreaming , everybody gets carried away sometimes . But there 's a difference between fantasizing in your head , and making a major plan for the future for the two of you without talking it through with your partner . `` Try consulting with your partner first . It 's so easy now , with texting , emailing , phoning and in person communication , '' Masini says . `` Have weekly 'calendar meetings ' where you discuss upcoming dates and trips , so you can both be on the same page . '' While someone might hope to take their relationship to the next level , they still make plans or choices , as if it 's a done deal . It may seem sweet to make special plans , but for something you 're way better off talk to your partner to gage where their head is at first before making any big life decisions .
As the New York Times reports this morning , the Nobel Prize for Peace has gone to a group that negotiated a UN treaty to ban and eventually eliminate all the world 's nuclear weapons ( you can see that treaty here and here ) . The treaty was adopted by the UN General Assembly last December , and the details about i can , the organization that pushed the treaty , is in the NYT article below ( click screenshot to go to article ) .
An excerpt :
In a year when threats from nuclear weapons seemed to draw closer , the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded on Friday to an advocacy group behind the first treaty to prohibit them . The group , the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons , a Geneva-based coalition of disarmament activists , was honored for its efforts to advance the negotiations that led to the treaty , which was reached in July at the United Nations . “ The organization is receiving the award for its work to draw attention to the catastrophic humanitarian consequences of any use of nuclear weapons and for its groundbreaking efforts to achieve a treaty-based prohibition of such weapons , ” the Norwegian Nobel Committee said in a statement . The choice amounted to a blunt rejoinder to the world 's nine nuclear-armed powers , which boycotted the negotiations and denounced the treaty as a naïve and dangerous diversion .
But if you look at the treaty ( and I have n't read it in detail ) , it 's not done and dusted—it stipulates that member nations should to sign such a declaration , which would then be “ legally binding ” after 50 countries ratify it . It 's a great step in gathering worldwide sentiment , but the whole thing sounds like a sham to me . Really , what is the chance that the US—even if 50 countries sign the treaty—will abandon its nukes , much less Russia , Israel , the UK , or , for crying out loud , North Korea ? And if you think Iran is going to forever put its nuclear weapons program on hold because of its agreement with the U.S. , I fear you 've been duped . If these countries violate the treaty , what can the UN do about it ? Nada !
This seems to me to be a prize awarded for intention rather than substantive accomplishment , like giving Henry Kissinger and Le Duc Tho the prize in 1973 ( there was n't even good intention there ) , or , for that matter , Barack Obama the prize in 2009 ( what peace did they create ? ) . What with North Korea having no intention of stopping its nuclear program , even under very tough sanctions , and Iran just waiting to get the bomb , the dream of a nuclear-free world is just that—a dream .

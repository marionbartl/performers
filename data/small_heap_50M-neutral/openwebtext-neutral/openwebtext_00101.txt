THE first storage docks designed specifically for motorcycles have been installed in the UK .
The three docks were installed in Chelmsford last week and are now on trial for the next three months . Two have been placed at Fairfield Road Long Stay car park off Coval Lane and one is at Parkway Short Stay surface car park .
The system gives bikers a place to lock up their motorcycle and riding gear so they do n't have to carry it around all day .
Toni Impieri , owner and marketing director of MotoParking , said : ‘ I was on a skiing holiday in Italy three years ago when I started speaking to a guy in the bar who told me about the idea they had for storing your gear . As a biker , I thought it was a fantastic idea - you do n't want to carry your gear around with you all the time . '
Another premise behind the idea is to encourage bikers to wear more riding gear , knowing that there 's a place for them to leave it .
Chelmsford MP , Simon Burns , worked on the project with Impieri for almost eight months to make the idea a reality .
MotoParking is now in negotiation with where else the docks could be installed to be convenient for bikers .
“ I could never do that. ” – Overheard at many a quilt show
I know a lot of quilters that are perfectionists . I 'm sure you know a few too ; they 're the ones that point out 10 mistakes the minute they show you one of their new quilts . I 'm just as guilty at doing this as the rest of you .
Here 's the problem with focusing only on your mistakes : you fail to see your own progress .
Ten Signs You Might Have a Fear of Failure – Psychology Today
1 . Failing makes you worry about what other people think about you .
2 . Failing makes you worry about your ability to pursue the future you desire .
3 . Failing makes you worry that people will lose interest in you .
4 . Failing makes you worry about how smart or capable you are .
5 . Failing makes you worry about disappointing people whose opinion you value .
6 . You tend to tell people beforehand that you do n't expect to succeed in order to lower their expectations .
7 . Once you fail at something you have trouble imagining what you could have done differently to succeed .
8 . You often get last minute headaches , stomachaches , or other physical symptoms that prevent you from completing your preparation .
9 . You often get distracted by tasks that prevent you from completing your preparation that in hindsight were not as urgent as they seemed at the time .
10 . You tend to procrastinate and ‘ run out of time ' to complete you preparation adequately
Fear of failure becomes a problem when you do n't want to set foot in your sewing room because you might mess up _____ . Or you do n't want to try free motion quilting for the first time because it wo n't look as polished as Leah Day 's samples . Or adding a border on Orca Bay terrifies you because you 've put countless hours into just getting the main quilt together and you do n't want to screw it all up ( I 'm talking to you Katie Ringo ) .
I 've always recommended a journal or a blog to document your quilting progress . Sometimes when I 'm frustrated I read back through my blog to see what was frustrating me three years ago .
As a fairly new quilter ( I 've been at this about 3 and a half years now ) it makes me sad to hear quilters that have been doing this for years say they 're afraid of trying free motion quilting or some other skill . How “ brave ” I must be to jump headfirst and try new things . Let me break it to you – I 'm not brave . Trying new things gives me serious anxiety and it puts me out of my comfort zone something awful . I do have a fear of failure for about 50 % of the things I attempt . I screw up projects all the time and I get frustrated when they do n't go smoothly . When it gets really bad I do n't sew for a week straight . Reading blogs sometimes can sabotage you when you 're having a bad week because it seems like everyone else in the blogosphere is doing just fine and dandy .
The honest truth : I have bad weeks just like everyone else , bloggers just tend to leave those weeks out .
I liken it to something that annoys my husband whenever we go to a restaurant , I typically try something I 've never tried before . I 'm always trying new stuff to see if it 's better than my favorite dish . I 'd guess 85 % of the time this comes back to bite me as the dish is rarely as good as my favorite or it 's a complete and utter failure . It 's the 15 % that I live for , the moments I take that first bite and it 's the best thing I 've ever had at that restaurant . Usually it 's worth all the failures .
I appreciate my successes more because of the failures that I 've had .
So ask yourself , what is your fear of failure holding you back from achieving ?
ANCHORAGE , Alaska – The feud between Alaska Congressman Don Young and prominent historian Douglas Brinkley that started at a House committee hearing last Friday has continued , with Brinkley calling Young a bully and a “ low-grade Joseph McCarthy . ”
Young , for their part , maintains that Brinkley is just a publicity hound who is trying to boost sales for their books .
Video of the nasty exchange between Brinkley and Young during last Friday 's committee hearing over drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge went viral on the Internet . It was featured Tuesday on NBC 's “ Nightly News ” broadcast , with anchor Brian Williams dubbing it “ moment of the week on Capitol Hill . … It goes very haywire very quickly . ”
The exchange was stunning , with a furious Young saying Brinkley 's testimony was “ garbage ” and that the Rice University professor needed to “ just be quiet. ” Brinkley told Young “ I pay your salary ! ” and mocked the member of congress 's education .
A staffer sitting behind Young fiddling with their phone bolted up straight in wide-eyed astonishment at the verbal smack-down .
Brinkley did not respond to an interview request from the Daily News this week . But he 's continued to poke Young in Lower 48 media . They told a television station in Houston , where Rice is located , that their students applauded when they walked into class .
“ I have received now hundreds and hundreds of emails from people all over , I 've not received one negative one , ” they said . “ I 've had my entire Rice University and including Texas conservatives cheering me on for standing up to their bullying tactics . ”
A Minneapolis online news site quoted Brinkley this week calling Young a “ menacing blowhard ” and a “ low-grade Joseph McCarthy , ” referring to the infamous 1950s politician who bullied congressional witnesses and claimed widespread communist subversion of American public life .
Young turned down an interview request from the Daily News this week , but their spokesperson said the blowup at last Friday 's hearing was a publicity ploy by Brinkley .
“ People will want to make this into more than what it really is : an attempt by an author to create a stir and sell books , ” said Young spokesperson Luke Miller .
The acrimony began after Brinkley , who published a book earlier this year about the early conservation movement in Alaska , testified to the House Natural Resources Committee that Congress should urge the president to make the ANWR coastal plain a national monument . Brinkley and others hope monument status would prevent oil drilling . Young maintains that monument status for ANWR would violate the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act .
Young , a Republican , has fought for four decades to open the area to drilling . They told Brinkley their testimony was “ garbage ” and mistakenly called them “ Dr . Rice. ” That prompted Brinkley to interrupt with a correction .
“ It 's Dr. Brinkley ; Rice is a university . I know you went to Yuba College and could n't graduate , ” Brinkley said .
Young , who actually did earn their associate degree at Yuba Community College , according to their congressional biography , and then later obtained a bachelor 's degree from Chico State , was apoplectic at the well-known historian .
“ I 'll call you anything I want to call you when you sit in that chair . You just be quiet . You be quiet ! ” Young said .
Brinkley was n't interested in being told by Young to shut up . “ You do n't own me . I pay your salary , ” Brinkley said .
The two also sparred over Young coming and going from the hearing . Young had come into the hearing late and said they were “ really pissed ” that Brinkley mentioned their absence , explaining they had been voting . When Young later left the hearing before it was over , Brinkley told the committee Young “ does n't stay , blows smoke and then leaves . ”
Young spokesperson Miller said this week that Brinkley was given their full time to testify and then repeatedly interrupted and was disrespectful . Miller said that Young has received positive feedback following the blowup with Brinkley .
“ While reaction from the Lower 48 has been mixed , much of the feedback our office is receiving from Alaskans has been supportive of Congressman Young . In fact , many have simply been saying ‘ Go get 'em Don , ' ” they said .
UKIP has now passed 600 filled Westminster candidate slots , with 601 appointed Parliamentary candidates , at the last count .
18 of our 22 MEPs are standing .
2 of our candidates are defending their seats : Douglas Carswell and Mark Reckless
11 % of our candidates are women – admittedly we could do better here , but remember that UKIP chooses on merit alone , and on that basis we had a high score for our MEP selections .
557 of 572 English and Welsh seats are filled – 97.4 %
And here is the regional breakdown of those selections :
Region Total Filled Unfilled South East 83 81 2 Eastern 58 58 0 East Midlands 46 44 2 London 73 73 0 North East 29 25 4 North West 75 74 1 Northern Ireland 18 10 8 Scotland 59 33 26 South West 55 55 0 West Midlands 59 56 3 Yorkshire and the Humber 55 53 2 Wales 40 39 1 650 601 49
( Note : the 7 unfilled seats in Northern Ireland are part of a deliberate strategy not to stand against some Unionist candidates , which has been approved by the party for Northern Ireland only )
The pundits claim we will only get 5-8 seats . UKIP 's answer to that is :

According to Kempf , the methods they developed through experimentation on their Ohio farm are now being used across North and South America , Hawaii , Europe , and Africa . The entrepreneur promises clients higher-quality crops , bigger yields , better taste , and produce that carries a lucrative “ organic ” label . Kempf , however , considers their process as an important improvement upon standard organic farming methods . “ Organic certification is a negative-process certification , ” they explained , “ You can do nothing to your field and become certified . In contrast , we focus on actively restoring the balance found in natural systems . ”
I recently sought out Samuel Zook , one of Kempf 's earliest converts , at their farm in Lancaster , Pennsylvania to see Advancing Eco Agriculture 's practices in action . After trailing a leisurely horse and carriage in my car for several miles , I was greeted at the farm by a bounding dog and Zook 's young barefoot son . The boy stared silently with their arms wrapped around a watermelon almost as big as himself . In a straw hat and suspenders , they looked like a miniature version of their father . The elder Zook smiled demurely through a neatly trimmed beard and extended their hand before inviting me on a tour of their fields . A hushed gaggle of children tripped along behind us as we walked among the bales of hay and rows of tomatoes , onions , melons , and squash .
Roc Morin : Can you describe the differences between how you used to farm and how you farm now ?
Samuel Zook : The inputs changed drastically . Instead of trying to grow crops that are healthy with fungicides and pesticides , I started to grow crops that are healthy with nutrition .
Morin : What was the hardest part about making the change ?
Zook : Well , there was a big psychological block that I had to get through . I 'd see a couple bugs out there and feel like I immediately had to do something about it . But , I learned that if I sit back , things will often take care of themselves . That first summer for instance , we saw a lot of horn worms . Before that , I would have sprayed them right away , but this time I waited and a bunch of wasps came along and killed them . Once I saw that , I started getting really excited .
Morin : So , when you use a pesticide you 're killing the predators too , right ?
Zook : Right . You 're killing the entire ecosystem .
Morin : Have all of your problems disappeared ?
Zook : I wish I could say that , but not entirely . We 're not living in the Garden of Eden yet . The issues I had before have disappeared , but we still have some other issues that we 're working on . One of the main things that has improved is how it feels to farm . Before , if I applied fungicide on my tomatoes , I had to wait three to seven days before I could reenter the area . Now , it 's so nice to just walk in my field any day of the week and not worry a bit . That in itself is huge . The other thing is , when I used to mix these skull-and-cross-bones chemicals to put in my sprayer , I 'd have to be suited up . The children would be around and I 'd say , “ Now , get in the house . It 's not safe. ” Now though , if the children want to help , it 's fine . If I want to mix the solutions better , I 'll just put my hand in a stir it around .

Hollywood 's battle against The Pirate Bay website continues in Europe with yet another injunction . A Dutch court has ordered the shutdown of a WordPress-based proxy operated by hosting company Greenhost . The company initially refused to take the proxy offline , but faced with a court order and the prospect of a 1,000 euro per day fine , Greenhost sees no other option than to throw in the towel .
Earlier this year we reported on a brand new anti-censorship WordPress plugin called RePress .
RePress turns any WordPress blog into a fully operational proxy . It 's a useful tool for people whose speech is restricted by oppressive regimes , but also handy for downloaders in the Netherlands , the UK and other countries where ISPs block The Pirate Bay .
The plugin makers , hosting company Greenhost , showed off this capability by running their own Pirate Bay proxy on its servers . However , not everyone was happy with this censorship workaround .
Because the proxy allowed the Dutch public to access The Pirate Bay , the Hollywood-backed anti-piracy group BREIN demanded that Greenhost take the proxy offline . However , the hosting company refused to do so and said it would only comply if presented with a court order .
Last Friday , such an order arrived . The Court of The Hague issued an ex-parte injunction and gave Greenhost 6 hours to take down all the proxies through which the public can access The Pirate Bay . If the company fails to comply it now faces a 1,000 euro fine per day .
The Court order is only directed at the proxies that were hosted by Greenhost . The WordPress plugin and proxies directed at other websites are allowed to stay up .
Greenhost CEO Sacha van Geffen is disappointed by the Court 's decision and the fact that their company was n't heard in the matter . The hosting provider will now consider what judicial steps to take next .
Previously the Dutch Pirate Party fought a similar injunction in court , but without success . After the court heard both sides the proxy ban was upheld . In addition , the Pirate Party was forbidden from encouraging the public to circumvent the Pirate Bay blockade and from listing or hosting tools that enable others to do so .
While it is clear that BREIN will do everything in its power to enforce the Pirate Bay blockade , the effectiveness of their course of action is questionable . Even worse , it might even be counterproductive .
Last week the Dutch Internet provider XS4All revealed that BitTorrent traffic on its network went up after they imposed the Pirate Bay blockade . All the media attention acts as promotion for BitTorrent , the ISP theorized .
A 23 year old Saskatoon man is in custody , as a result of a stolen vehicle / motor vehicle collision investigation this afternoon .
At 3:55 PM Tuesday , police received a report of a vehicle being stolen in the 300 block of Ave T N. The vehicle had been left running with the keys in it . Officers working in the area observed the vehicle and followed it to the intersection of 33rd Street and Idylwyld Dr. At this point the suspect operating the stolen vehicle , abandon it and fled on foot . An SPS officer on scene gave chase on foot , however as they ran north across 33rd Street they were struck by a westbound vehicle .
Additional police units responded and the suspect was tracked to an apartment block in the 1100 block of Ave B North , however police were not able to determine the suspect 's exact location .
Just after 7:00 PM , police received additional information indicating the suspect was still in the apartment block in the 1100 block of Ave B North . Officers responded and the suspect was taken in to custody without further incident .
The suspect was also wanted on an unrelated arrest warrant . They will be held in custody and appear in court Wednesday afternoon .
The 37 year old SPS constable injured in the collision was transported to hospital by MD ambulance with non-life threatening injuries . They have since been released .
Traffic restrictions in the area of 33rd and Idylwyld Drive have been removed and traffic is flowing normally .

The Catholic diocese in Missouri led by Bishop Robert Finn , who was convicted last year of failing to report a priest who was taking pornographic pictures of children , will pay a $ 600,000 settlement to the family of one of the priest 's victims .
The family filed the civil suit in federal court in 2011 against Finn , the Diocese of Kansas City-St. Joseph , Mo. , and the Rev . Shawn Ratigan , who pleaded guilty last year to charges of producing child pornography .
Ratigan had taken hundreds of lewd and suggestive photos of young children ; the lawsuit , which was settled on Tuesday ( May 14 ) , was filed by the parents of a girl who was 2 years old when Ratigan started photographing them in 2006 .
“ We hope this settlement comforts at least some of the many families who have suffered and are suffering because Bishop Robert Finn refused to call police , protect kids and monitor Father Shawn Ratigan , ” said Barbara Dorris of SNAP , the Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests .
Last September , in an arrangement with prosecutors , Finn was convicted of a misdemeanor charge of failing to report Ratigan to authorities as required by law . Finn and the diocese had received multiple complaints about Ratigan in the months preceding the priest 's arrest in 2011 and church officials had seen some of the pictures of children on their laptop computer in December 2010 .
Despite calls for Finn to resign , they have remained as head of the diocese . Diocesan spokesperson Jack Smith told The Kansas City Star that the payout would be covered by insurance .
The tab for Finn 's own defense amounted to $ 1.4 million , the diocese said last year , which was covered by insurance plus funds collected from parishes .
The judge in the civil lawsuit dismissed the claim that Finn and the diocese aided and abetted Ratigan in possessing pornography .
The diocese previously paid out $ 10 million in 2008 to settle cases by plaintiffs who alleged sexual abuse by 12 priests . It still faces dozens of other lawsuits related to abuse allegations against other priests .

The New Orleans Saints will take on the Atlanta Falcons in the Superdome on Monday night . The game will go down almost exactly 10 years after the boys in black and gold celebrated their post-Katrina return to the same stadium with a triumphant victory over the same team .
I originally intended to honor this anniversary by making U2 and Green Day 's rendition of “ The Saints Are Coming ” –which was recorded for that fateful day 10 years ago–the newest Song of the Week , but former OffBeat Web Editor Alex Rawls already wrote the definitive story on that piece of music/sports history for My Spilt Milk , so there 's no need to dive into that one . Instead I 'll be taking a look at Miles Davis ' 1957 rendition of the jazz standard “ Bye Bye Blackbird . ”
The Saints ' season is n't looking too hot right now . With a record of 0-2 , it 's going to be an uphill battle to win our division . But beating the Falcons is about more than wins and losses . It 's about pride . These are the Dirty Birds we 're talking about–the Saints ' longtime rivals and representatives of an objectively inferior Southern metropolis . If all goes well they 'll be flying back to Atlanta on Monday night with their tail feathers between their legs . And that 's why “ Bye Bye Blackbird ” is our Saints Songs of the Week .
Originally penned by Ray Henderson and Mort Dixon in 1926 , “ Bye Bye Blackbird ” has been tackled by countless artists in the ensuing decades . I 've decided to go with this version from Miles Davis ' album ‘ Round About Midnight because , while Davis may not be the best representative of New Orleans , he 's a damn fine representative of jazz . It 's also an instrumental rendition , so we do n't have to be sidetracked by the fact that the lyrics have no connection to anything resembling football .

The $ 1 billion could build 17 new high schools like the one planned for central Sydney or a 400-bed hospital like the one opened in Bendigo in regional Victoria this year . The dispute could be the largest single corporate tax matter before the ATO . Credit : Karl Hilzinger Chevron 's tax bill is a so-called `` transfer pricing '' matter and hinges on the rate of interest its Australian subsidiary pays on a $ 42 billion loan from its US parent to fund the massive Gorgon and Wheatstone LNG plants off the coast of Western Australia . The ATO is chasing multinationals that saddle their local operations with unreasonably high debt costs , thereby `` exporting '' profits via inflated interest payments to lower tax jurisdictions and avoiding Australia 's 30 per cent company tax rate . In April , Chevron lost Australia 's biggest-ever transfer pricing case and was ordered by the Federal Court to pay $ 340 million in taxes , penalties and interest .
That finding , which the company has vowed to appeal to the High Court , stemmed from a 2003 loan in relation to Chevron 's part ownership of the North West Shelf gas project . In that case , Chevron Australia paid $ 1.84 billion in interest on a loan that cost Chevron Corp in the US just $ 110 million to service . ATO commissioner Chris Jordan . Credit : Andrew Meares Chevron revealed its latest tax dispute with the ATO in written answers to questions from the Senate 's inquiry into corporate tax avoidance . `` Chevron Australia and the ATO disagree on how the law applies to determine the interest rate to apply to Chevron Australia 's financing arrangements . The total difference in primary tax on all years currently in dispute is $ 1.062 billion , '' Derek Floreani , Chevron 's general manager finance and compliance wrote . The company also stated that it had paid no company tax in five of the past seven financial years . In 2011 and 2012 , Chevron paid an effective tax rate of 7 per cent and 8 per cent , respectively , less than a third of the corporate rate .
Its latest financial accounts lodged with the Australian Securities and Investment Commission show it had revenue of $ 2.1 billion in 2016 . An ATO spokesperson said Mr Jordan would not comment on individual taxpayers but `` as a general principle '' they expected all debts to be paid once an assessment is issued . `` The commissioner expects that all debts , including those subject to dispute , will be paid on time , '' they said . If a company is fighting a ruling it is asked to pay 50 per cent of the outstanding tax bill until the matter is resolved . A Chevron spokesperson said the company was `` one of Australia 's largest investors and employers '' .
`` As recognised by the Federal Court , Chevron Australia 's financing is a legitimate business arrangement , and the parties differ only in their assessments of the appropriate interest rate to apply . Chevron Australia pays a substantial amount of tax in Australia , including royalties , payroll tax , fringe benefits tax , excise and interest withholding tax . Since 2009 , we 've paid about $ 4.5 billion in federal and state taxes and royalties , '' they said . Neither Chevron nor the ATO would comment on how many tax years the $ 1 billion involves . Fairfax Media first revealed in 2015 that LNG producers like Chevron would not pay any federal royalty for at least a decade or more due to generous write offs available under the petroleum resource rent tax . A recent report to Treasurer Scott Morrison found LNG exporters would soon sell $ 50 billion a year in the resource without paying anything for its extraction . Chevron told the Senate committee that it expected to start paying PRRT from Gorgon some time between `` 2029 and the mid-2030s '' .

Immigration detention centre ‘ is not well run ' and ‘ insupportable ' in its current form , five-member cross-party select committee reports
All children should be removed from Nauru detention , Senate inquiry finds
All asylum seeker children should be removed from the Nauru detention centre because the centre is “ insupportable ” in its current form , a Senate inquiry has found .
The Nauru regional processing centre is marred by widespread allegations of child abuse , violence against asylum seekers , deprivation and sexual assault , and the Australian government does not know what is happening on the island , a five-member cross-party select committee into abuse on the island reported on Monday .
Transfield named Coalition 's 'preferred tenderer ' for Manus and Nauru centres Read more
“ Nauru is not run well , nor are Wilson Security and Transfield Services properly accountable to the commonwealth despite the significant investment in their services , ” the majority report says .
“ The committee believes that the shortcomings of the current framework offer no reassurance that the department is fully aware of events on Nauru . ”
All asylum seeker children should be removed from Nauru , new laws should mandate reporting of sexual assault and violence allegations , and workers on the island should submit to daily drug and alcohol tests , the committee 's report recommended .
Women and children – there are now 87 in detention – were particularly vulnerable to sexual harassment and assault , because they could not be removed from the island , or moved anywhere safe on Nauru , the committee argued .
The committee also found that Australia – not Nauru – is legally responsible for the abuses in Nauru detention centre , because it has “ effective control ” of it .
Australia 's justifications that problems on Nauru are a matter for that country 's government are “ a cynical and unjustifiable attempt to avoid accountability ” , the committee said .
“ Australia created the regional processing centre in Nauru . It is Australia 's responsibility and in its present form , it is insupportable . ”
The committee condemned the Department of Immigration and Border Protection for its lack of control of the centre , and the absence of any reporting mechanism for staff “ to disclose allegations of mistreatment , abuse or to make complaints ” .
“ The department has been unaware of serious acts of misconduct by staff of contractors , as those contractors have not adequately fulfilled their reporting obligations . ”
The committee said the government and its contractors had attempted to hide information about what was happening on Nauru . “ The committee remains of the view that the government in particular has sought to avoid the full accountability to which the Senate is entitled . ”
The report found that running the detention centre on Nauru has cost Australian taxpayers $ 1.333bn since it was reopened in September 2012 – about $ 37m a month .
On average , asylum seekers spent 402 days in detention on Nauru .

The Senate inquiry follows last year 's report by the Australian Human Rights Commission , The Forgotten Children , into children in Australian immigration detention .
That report found that more than 300 children committed or threatened self-harm in a 15-month period in Australian immigration detention , 30 reported sexual assault , nearly 30 went on hunger strike , and more than 200 were victims of assaults .
The government will respond to the Senate report after consideration of its recommendations . The office of the immigration minister , Peter Dutton , has been contacted for comment .
The Liberal party senators on the committee , Linda Reynolds and David Johnston ( who replaced Cory Bernardi ) , presented a dissenting report , arguing that the government of Nauru was responsible for the running of the centre and that much of the inquiry was politically motivated .
“ The government has a determined and successful policy of ending the illegal trafficking of people into Australia and this policy is politically unacceptable to some senators , ” they wrote . “ This inquiry has sought in many respects to advance the political perspective of those opposing senators . ”
The government senators said many of the allegations of abuse were untested and reliant on “ unsubstantiated hearsay ” . They said the number of children in detention on Nauru had decreased significantly under the government and said all of the committee 's recommendations were “ redundant ” .
The Greens ' immigration spokesperson , Senator Sarah Hanson-Young , who was spied upon by guards when they visited Nauru on an official visit , said the detention regime was damaging children . “ It ca n't be made any clearer that locking children up with the guards on Nauru is exposing them to abuse , ” they said .
“ The government 's head-in-the-sand approach to mounting evidence of systemic child abuse is causing immeasurable harm . ”

The Greens tabled additional recommendations including : the reinstatement and compensation of 10 Save the Children workers who were sacked on untrue allegations of coaching self-harm among asylum seekers ; a royal commission into children in detention , and ; an Australian federal police investigation into spying allegations .
Hanson-Young also called for the termination of Transfield 's contract to run the Nauru detention centre on the day the government indicated it wanted to negotiate with Transfield for another five-year deal .
When questioned about the inquiry 's recommendation that journalists should be allowed to visit the Nauru detention centre , Dutton , the immigration minister , said they would not dictate migration matters to another sovereign country .
“ It 's an issue for the Nauruan government , ” they told Sky News .
The War Z , Hammerpoint Interactive 's zombie survival shooter which has had a tumultuous community response following its recent launch , has been pulled from Steam .
`` From time to time a mistake can be made and one was made by prematurely issuing a copy of War Z for sale via Steam , '' Valve vice president of marketing Doug Lombardi wrote in a statement to Polygon . `` We apologize for this and have temporary removed the sale offering of the title until we have time to work with the developer and have confidence in a new build . Those who purchase the game and wish to continue playing it via Steam may do so . Those who purchased the title via Steam and are unhappy with what they received may seek a refund by creating a ticket at our support site here . ''
The game has been under fire from a number of purchasers , who claim that it does n't live up to several of the promises made by the developer prior to launch . Executive producer Sergei Titov responded to those complaints on the game 's forums , stating , `` This is not a boxed product that you buy one time . It 's evolving product that will have more and more features and content coming it . This is what The War Z is . ''

I had the “ opportunity ” to travel to Iowa last week , a state so boring I feel bad even making jokes . * In three nights we hit three restaurants and a bar that were nothing short of fantastic for food and beer alike .
* Ok , not that bad . It may be the only state more boring than the one in which I currently reside .
Zombie Burger
Ok , this is not really a beer bar , though none of us would go thirsty . It is a zombie movie themed burger restaurant , but it is awesome enough that Aleheads everywhere need to know about it . The place is full of zombie pop art , has about twenty or so cleverly-named burger options , ( e.g . the Boomstick and the Juan of the Dead ) , and a milkshake called the Tallahassee ( of course , with a Twinkie blended into it ) . The burger I ordered ( named They 're Coming to Get You , Barbara ) came between two grilled cheese sandwiches instead of buns . Yeah , I 'm going to let that sink in for a sec . Oh , and there were also about ten taps including Bell 's Two-hearted , and 40 or so craft bottle options , which means it was solid on the beer front as well . Nice work , guys .

Downtown Des Moines ' premier brewery . Actually I think it is downtown Des Moines 's only brewery , although there are a couple others within city limits . The menu was mostly fairly standard fare , but very well executed and tasty . There were the standard four or five year-round session styles that just about every brewery produces . But from there , things got interesting–they have a “ premier ” line of more inventive beers including :
21st Amendment Ale– A dry hopped rye pale ale aged in rye whiskey barrels . Out of the glass a huge whiff of vanilla and oak , some spicy rye , and a big hop nose . 3.5 Hops
Infactuation– A Belgian-style dubbel blended with a Flemish brown that was brewed with raspberries . Though I appreciate the creative effort , it did n't quite hit the nail on the head for me . 2 Hops
They also had a dry-hopped imperial brown and a saison on cask that we did n't get around to trying , but sounded good .
Fong 's Pizza
This one came as a recommendation from a local . It 's an old chop suey restaurant that switched over to become a pizza joint , but never forgot its roots . We split an order of pizza rolls ( mozzarella , pepperoni and sausage stuffed into a egg-roll wrapper and deep fried ) , and got a Mu-Shu Pork Pizza for the main course . There were about ten taps , and 50 or so bottles , plus a full service tiki bar for those looking for a beverage with a little more rum in it . We stayed local and drank beers from Peace Tree Brewing .
Rye Porter– The standard Peace Tree dark , a departure from your ho-hum porter or dry stout , bottle conditioned with Belgian Yeast . The rye added a slick mouthful and a touch of sourness . 2.5 Hops
Hop Wrangler IPA- The perfect name for an Iowan IPA . Again a bit of a departure from the norm , their standard IPA is brewed with Belgian yeast , and reminded me a bit of Little Sumpin ' Wild from Lagunitas , which should be considered high praise . 3.0 Hops
El Bait Shop
A stereotypical dive bar with mangy taxidermied animals , wood paneling , live music , and 116 craft taps , plus more in the bottle . You know , the usual . I tried the Peace Tree IPA Hop Sutra DIPA which was good , ( 3 Hops ) and then switched to Bell Expedition Stout ( 4 Hops ) because it was 10 degrees outside and I wanted a 10 % ABV beer that tasted like a chocolate milkshake . Got a problem ?
While it may not be Ashville or Portland , Des Moines is a pretty good city for beer , and any Alehead should be happy if they are forced to visit at some point . Just wear your eating pants .
Britain 's most expensive parking spot has gone on sale for £400,000 – nearly 2.5 times the cost of an average UK home .
The underground space , which can fit two cars , is near London 's Royal Albert Hall in Kensington and costs 15 times the average UK salary of £26,500 .
For the same amount of money , a motorist could afford to park their car 880 yards away at the nearest NCP car park for 31 years - at a cost of £35.10 a day .
Just 10 months ago , a similar space in the same car park went on sale - for a slightly more reasonable £275,000 .
But the price tag for a space in the exclusive underground lot has increased by 31 per cent - or £125,000 – in that time .
For the same amount of money a motorist could afford to park their car 880 yards away at the nearest NCP car park for 31 years ( HobartSlater/BNPS )
Despite the eye-watering price , local residents are unlikely to baulk at the cost of the double space as the average property in the SW7 post code sells for £2.3million .
And according to the latest Land Registry figures , the parking space is still £3,792 cheaper than the average property price in London .
The freehold is described as a “ large secure underground parking space ideally situated for an Albert Court or Albert Hall Mansions resident ” .
Cars parked in the lit underground car park are also protected by double doors which can be padlocked by the owner .
The space is being sold through upmarket estate agents Hobart Slater and is across the road from Hyde Park and Kensington Gardens .
The agent is used to dealing with high-value properties – one listing currently on their books is a nearby four-bedroom apartment that is on the market for £9,850,000
Similar garage spaces in Knightsbridge are also being sold through their website but are listed at an almost reasonable £150,000 .
A spokesperson for Hobart Slater told a reporter : “ We 've already had plenty of interest in the space . ”
Another sough-after parking spot can be found just down the road , where an 11ft by 12ft space in Hyde Park Gardens is on the market with estate agents Kay & Co for £300,000 . They report that several people have already expressed an interest .
Hundreds of high-ranking officials and business leaders from all over the world will gather in Georgia 's capital Tbilisi in November this year to attend the Silk Road Forum .
The Forum , held on November 28-29 , aims to establish a platform for an annual high level meeting where interested parties can get together and explore opportunities , align visions and enhance bilateral partnerships in four main areas of cooperation : transport , energy , trade and business-to-business contacts .
The upcoming Forum was today discussed between Georgia 's Economy Minister Giorgi Gakharia and Chinese Ambassador to Georgia Ji Yanchi .
The Silk Road Forum will feature addresses by distinguished keynote speakers and give business executives and policymakers to share their views , experiences and expertise on how to reestablish the historic Silk Road to reinvigorate trade with Asia .
This will be the second Silk Road Forum that will be held in Tbilisi .
For the first time the Forum was held in Tbilisi in October 2015 , where more than one thousand officials from 30 countries took part .
There are allegations of police brutality after a Toledo police officer allegedly hit a handcuffed suspect in the head and it 's all caught on camera .
`` It appears to me from looking at this video that it 's excessive force and completely inappropriate , ” says Phil Stinson , a criminologist at Bowling Green State University .
This comes one month after a state panel held a series of forums on improving relationships , easing tensions , and building trust .
The arrest happened on Wednesday in East Toledo on the 900 block of Berry Street .
13abc contacted Toledo police to get their reaction to the video .
Public Information Officer Sgt . Joe Heffernan said it was the first time they saw the footage of the arrest . Heffernan later called 13abc back saying they can not comment because the department is now launching an internal investigation .
`` Police brutality captured at its finest , ” says Brad Bollinger , the neighbor who shot the cell phone video from the window of their upstairs bedroom .
The suspect 's sister tells 13abc that police were executing warrants for their brother 's arrest . The suspect is 20-year-old Raymond Rober .
Rober 's sister Amanda tells 13abc that at first their brother ran from police , but then they surrendered as their friends on the sidewalk also took video .
`` As they lean their head down , he 's adjusting the handcuffs on the back of them because they 're probably uncomfortable and the lady officer strikes them in the side of the head , ” says Bollinger . `` It 's a coward move . It 's a thing of complete power . They know that they have them and they have no where to go , so they took complete advantage of it . It 's a sucker move . ''
`` It seems to me , based on the other officers conduct , they did n't do something that justified being hit in any capacity , ” says Phil Stinson , a criminologist at Bowling Green State University . “ Certainly not while being handcuffed . ''
Stinson is a former police officer who has been studying police crimes for ten years .
Their project called Police Integrity Lost is funded by the U.S. Department of Justice .
`` That type of excessive force is typically in a situation where an officer is completely frustrated with the situation that just unfolded , ” says Stinson .
Stinson says it may be a criminal offense because when a suspect is in handcuffs … `` You should be protected from the police from being assaulted , not assaulted by the police , ” says Stinson . “ But it 's frustration . Frustration on the officer 's part… We do n't really see the context of what unfolded in the seconds and minutes before the video that was shot here by a bystander . ”
Meanwhile , Rober is in the Lucas County Jail on charges of resisting arrest , obstructing official business , aggravated menacing , under-age possession of alcohol , assault , disorderly conduct , criminal trespassing , and domestic violence .
Bollinger , the neighbor who shot the video , revealed they have a criminal record . Bollinger is due to go off probation in June for an aggravated robbery four years ago . Bollinger served 18 months in jail .
Gujarat 's minister of state for health Shankar Chaudhary has tested positive for swine flu , just days after the assembly Speaker was diagnosed with the H1N1 virus . Chaudhary is now undergoing treatment at a special isolation room in their house in Gandhinagar .
`` Shankar Chaudhary report… has revealed that they are having swine flu . They are now being treated at a special isolation room created at their residence in Gandhinagar ( sic ) , '' state health commissioner JP Gupta said on Monday .
Chaudhary attended the state assembly session on Monday and took part in a discussion on the steps taken by the state government to control the outbreak of swine flu in the state .
`` Thnx all 4 ur concern ( sic ) . With ur love , affection , prayers n blessings , I m sure to get back to office soon . Thanks once again , '' Chaudhary tweeted .
On Friday , Gujarat assembly Speaker Ganpat Vasava had been tested positive for H1N1 virus and was admitted in a Surat hospital .
So far , 219 people have died of swine flu in the state , while the number of cases has gone up to 3,337 .
The government has come in for severe criticism from the Opposition Congress , alleging it had failed to tackle the swine flu surge in the state .
`` Swine flu has become epidemic and yet the stat government is not ready to declare epidemic in the state . There is huge shortage of medicines and medical staff including doctors in the government hospitals , '' Congress MLA and former health minister Shaktisinh Gohil said .
Ahmedabad district collector Rajkumar Beniwal issued a notification banning gathering of more than 10 people at any public place in order to prevent the spread of the H1N1 virus .
Swine flu claimed the lives of 21 more people as the toll reached 833 across the country on Monday , while the number of persons affected by H1N1 virus breached the 14,000 mark .
Former Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot had recently tested positive for swine flu . `` Mujhe bhi swine flu positive aaya hai , lekin maine samay par ilaaj shuru kar liya hai , ab improvement hai , '' they had tweeted after they were diagnosed .

The Coalition 's $ 2.5bn “ Direct Action ” climate policy appears likely to pass the Senate after the environment minister , Greg Hunt , agreed to minor amendments , but doubts remain about whether it can achieve Australia 's 2020 emission reduction target and pave the way for deeper long-term cuts .
The government has agreed to independent senator Nick Xenophon 's demand it moves quickly to set up a “ safeguards ” scheme to impose penalties on companies that increase their greenhouse emissions – but has not committed to any detail .
It has rejected Xenophon 's push to allow the government purchase international carbon permits , something the prime minister once described as sending “ money … offshore into dodgy carbon farms in Equatorial Guinea and Kazakhstan ” , even though this would have made it easier and cheaper to reach Australia 's agreed emissions reduction target .
The government also agreed to get the Climate Change Authority – which it was once committed to abolish – to investigate the Palmer United party 's idea of a dormant emissions trading scheme , which would be activated when major trading parties had equivalent policies – with the CCA to report to the parliament .
Under Direct Action the government will commit $ 2.5bn over four years for competitive grants to companies or organisations that volunteer to reduce their emissions .
It had proposed to defer for a year any consideration of a so-called “ safeguards ” mechanism to impose some upper limit on emissions across the board – including on companies or sectors not bidding in its auction – so that their increasing emissions do not cancel out the decreases in emissions purchased through the government fund .
Xenophon has insisted the government set up these “ safeguards ” straight away , but has left it up to Hunt to determine how a company 's emission “ baseline ” should be calculated , and what penalties should apply if it is exceeded .
As revealed by Guardian Australia in August , former Australian Conservation Foundation head Don Henry and co-chair of Greg Hunt 's own expert committee on Direct Action , Danny Price , have been involved in months of backroom talks to win the backing of PUP , Xenophon and DLP senator John Madigan during the three months since the government succeeded in repealing the former government 's carbon pricing scheme .
Xenophon told Guardian Australia last week their amendments to the “ safeguard mechanism ” were about making sure the government got value for money , but could be “ a building block to a baseline and credit-style emissions trading scheme down the track ” .
“ It could evolve into that , ” they said , “ but the amendments do n't do that as they stand . ”
The deal , which was still being finalised Wednesday after delicate negotiations , would be a major achievement for Hunt .
But deep concerns about the adequacy of the policy remain . The government has not modelled whether the fund has enough money to meet Australia 's minimum 2020 target to reduce emissions by 5 % , with Abbott saying during the election campaign they preferred to just “ have a crack ” .
But Modelling by Reputex climate analytics , commissioned by the environment group WWF-Australia , found it was likely to fall short by $ 5.9bn a year between 2015 and 2020 , or between $ 20bn and $ 35bn in total . Separate Modeling by Sinclair Knight Merz/MMA and Monash University 's Centre of Policy Studies , commissioned by the Climate Institute , which used assumptions more generous to the Coalition , found it would need at least another $ 4bn . Abbott has said if Direct Action falls short they will not allocate any more money .
Declining electricity demand is likely to have made the 2020 target somewhat easier to achieve , but many observers , including Coalition frontbencher Malcolm Turnbull , have also warned its costs could become prohibitive when Australia faces deeper greenhouse gas cuts after 2020 , especially without the option of buying offshore carbon permits .
In a 2010 speech after they were deposed as leader , Turnbull said direct-action style schemes were “ a recipe for fiscal recklessness on a grand scale ” and “ schemes where bureaucrats and politicians pick technologies and winners , doling out billions of taxpayers ' dollars , neither are economically efficient nor will be environmentally effective ” .
And the “ blue book ” prepared by the Treasury for a possible incoming Coalition government in 2010 said “ a market mechanism can achieve the necessary abatement at a cost per tonne of emissions that is far lower than alternative direct-action policies ” .
Tandoori Spiced Chicken Thighs
I never tried Indian food until after I started college . When I finally had it , I felt wronged . `` Culinarily '' -deprived . ( I ca n't find a better phrase for it , so why not make one up ? ) . I could not believe all of the delicious foods I had been missing out on . For years . Years ! Naan , alone , was enough to make me feel like I never needed another cuisine.A few more years of dining hall meal plans , and then I was out on my own . Off to fend for myself in the kitchen . It took me so long before I approached Indian recipes.B 's sister gifted him/us a cookbook , and as excited as I was , the ingredient lists felt overwhelming . Then , one fortunately lazy afternoon , I took a peek at B 's mom 's Gourmet Cookbook and fell upon a recipe for Tandoori Chicken Thighs . I immediately swooned for the bright red , bone-in , chicken that arrives at your table sizzling on a skillet.It had to be done.A couple of surprises when making this recipe . As you can see , the chicken is n't bright red ! Turns out this recipe lacks the red spices ( cayenne , kashmiri red chili powder , etc ) that result in the typical red hue . I assume that Gourmet was looking for a more mild-spiced version to appeal to a variety of pallets . ( They forgot about folks like me , the spicier the better ! ) The next surprise , the spices were easy to come by . Unlike cardamom , which I can NEVER find . But that 's a different story.adapted from The Gourmet Cookbook1 Tablespoon onion powder1/2 teaspoon garlic powder1/8 teaspoon ground ginger6 oz plain Greek yogurt1 Tablespoon lemon juice2 teaspoons salt1 teaspoon turmeric2 teaspoons ground cumin2 teaspoons ground coriander1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper1/4 teaspoon cayenne1/4 teaspoon cinnamon3 lbs boneless , skinless chicken thighsIn a large mixing bowl , whisk together the Greek yogurt with the lemon juice and all of the spices.Trim the excess fat off the chicken thighs and stir into the yogurt mixture , making sure to coat all sides of the chicken.Put chicken and spiced-yogurt mixture into a large heavy-duty sized plastic seal-able bag . Close bag tightly and ensure that chicken is well-coated . Marinate in the refrigerator for at least 4 hours , and up to 12 hours . ( Mine marinated overnight . ) Preheat broiler , set on high . Line the broiler pan with foil and spread out chicken in a single layer . Broil chicken , about 5-6 inches from the flame , until they are cooked through ( about 16 - 20 minutes ) . Make sure to turn once during the cook time . ( Depending on the size of your pan , you may have to cook the chicken thighs in multiple batches ) Serve with basmati rice , and/or your other favorite sides , and enjoy !

Chechen soldiers serve as military police protecting the airfield , patrolling , escorting humanitarian supplies and performing other tasks .
Another rotation of Russian troops has been held In Syria . New servicemen went there from Chechnya to replace the military police battalion that had returned , reported Rosbalt citing an informed source that also specified that it was about non-military operations . The military police will guard the airfield , patrol , escort humanitarian supplies , etc .
The unit created on the basis of Vostok and Zapad battalions ( now disbanded ) is going to stay In Syria for 5 months .
This would be the second battalion with the Chechen security forces that has gone to Syria . The first one went there in November 2016 and returned on March 17 , 2017 . All of the members are contractors with experience of service in hot spots , said Daniil Martynov , the center manager , assistant to Chechen head Ramzan Kadyrov and Rosgvardia deputy head for the republic .
The fighters had been trained at the International Training Center for Special Forces in Gudermes with former employees of elite special forces Alfa , Vympel and the GRU as their instructors .
Earlier this year Ramzan Kadyrov made a post on Instagram on the work of the Chechen military in Syria , saying the men were proud to have the honor to maintain peace and order in Aleppo . They also argued the Chechens would consider themselves very lucky if they got a chance to protect the Syrian airport .
Another goal the Chechens in Syria pursue is establishing contacts with the locals , and the soldiers underwent a special training to do this , Kadyrov stressed .
Earlier , Novaya Gazeta had unveiled brochures listing the rules of conduct in Syria . The small booklets include basic information about the country : geographical information , language , holidays , currency , and customs . They speak of various types of weapons used and give some Russian-Arabic phrases .
Up till this moment , Kadyrov has argued that all the reports claiming Chechen battalions were being prepared for sending to Syria for a ground operation were fake .

Von Miller joins Lindsay Czarniak on SportsCenter to discuss the battle for the Broncos ' starting quarterback position and how Denver 's defense will be pivotal to the team 's success this season . ( 1:00 )
ENGLEWOOD , Colo. -- Simmering below the surface of the ever-present public discourse about the Denver Broncos ' quarterback situation , the defending Super Bowl champions have a few additional questions to answer before the season begins .
Among those issues leading the way in the non-quarterback category is how things will look on the depth chart at running back for a team that has vowed to run the ball better . The rub is , as the Broncos have tried to decide who will be the quarterback , they have certainly let the fellas drop back and sling it around .
So far in the preseason , no team has thrown more passes than the Broncos ' 89 : 44.5 per game . And after two preseason games , the Broncos are 19th in the league in rushing attempts with 53 .
Broncos coach Gary Kubiak has admitted they have `` let them throw it around a little bit , '' but said they are n't distracted by the quarterback competition and is dialed-in on the other matters as well . Still , most of the questions from the outside that they face day in and day out are about the quarterbacks .
“ It 's easy for me to balance , because I have a lot of issues going on , '' Kubiak said . “ It 's hard for me to balance with you guys because that 's what you all want to talk about . When I walk up here , I can promise you there 's a lot of balance going on . … As a coach , your mind is always set for opening day . That 's where you 're trying to get your football team . That 's what I 'm trying to do right now and also be able to make these decisions we have to make . ''
Some of the toughest decisions will come at running back . C.J . Anderson is the clear No . 1 , but for the most part the Broncos have let the young guys lug the rock the most . Kapri Bibbs , battling to force the Broncos to keep four running backs in addition to fullback Andy Janovich , leads in preseason carries so far with 18 . Rookie Devontae Booker has 13 .
Kapri Bibbs ( 35 ) , Juwan Thompson and Andy Janovich ( 32 ) wait their turn in running back drills on Aug. 8 . David Zalubowski/AP Photo
Anderson and Booker have spent most training camp and the preseason as the top two backs in the rotation . Juwan Thompson has largely been considered the third back because they have positional versatility , given that they play both running back and fullback to go with their full slate of special teams .
Janovich will make the roster because the sixth-round pick is currently the only rookie listed as a starter on the depth chart . Like Thompson , they have a full docket of special-teams duties . If the Broncos keep three running backs and Janovich , that 's it .
The question is whether or not they will keep four in addition to Janovich . If so , then Bibbs and Ronnie Hillman , the team 's leading rusher in 2015 , are battling for that last spot .
And those backs have all tried to show what they can do amid the Broncos ' festival of passes .
“ I think we took a step [ forward ] last week , '' Kubiak said . “ … Once you have confidence running the ball early , then you continue to do it . Runs at the end of the game tend to be longer because you 're fresh . You feel like you 're getting on them . Being persistent is one of the things we preach . ''
“ When a guy gets in there and he 's doing their thing , you cheer them on because that 's all you can do , '' Bibbs said .
The Broncos have had the ball plenty in their two preseason games -- 151 plays on offense in all -- but until they are comfortable with their decisions at quarterback , the running backs will likely have to make the most of their opportunities . The preseason finale at Arizona could be their time . With the Broncos ' starters expected to get their final work of the preseason Saturday against the Los Angeles Rams , the preseason game against the Cardinals could be the run-first affair the backs need to close things out .
“ When it comes to a guy like me , I 'm in there and I 'm trying my best , '' Bibbs said . “ I hope those guys will encourage me and cheer me on the same way I will with them , because there 's nothing that they can do to stop my chances . ”
Republican presidential hopeful Donald Trump told `` Fox & Friends '' Monday that they wo n't be receiving votes from two of their children in the New York primary on April 19 .
Both Eric and Ivanka Trump waited too long to register to vote , missing the cutoff and quashing any chance they had to cast a ballot for their famous father .
`` They had a long time to register , and they were unaware of the rules , and they did n't register in time , '' Trump said in a phone interview . `` So they feel very , very guilty . They feel very guilty . But it 's fine , I mean , I understand that . ''
Trump incorrectly claimed New Yorkers `` have to register a year in advance '' to vote . Residents are actually required to register at least 25 days prior to an election . ( Here 's how you can register to vote no matter where you live . )
`` So Eric and Ivanka , I guess , wo n't be voting , '' Trump said before joking he 'd take away their allowance for the mistake .
A Fox News poll released Sunday shows Trump leading their rivals , Sen. Ted Cruz ( Texas ) and Ohio Gov . John Kasich , in New York ahead of the state 's primary .
Transient Shaper
`` I really love Transient Shaper ! I 'm a visual person so being able to see the envelope helps me understand how the signal is being processed . This will become a part of my arsenal for sure . `` Kill the Noise
When you want to carefully tweak the punch of your snare , the ricki-ticki-ticking of your hi-hats or the snappiness of a synth line , Transient Shaper is the right tool for the job .
Using a compressor is the most common way of adjusting the dynamics of a sound , but sometimes this can be a bit cumbersome . This is where Transient Shaper shines , giving you very direct control over the character of both the attack and sustaining sections of the sound in a way that 's simple to understand and tweak .
Attack The amount of amplification or attenuation of the transient . Pump The amount of attenuation directly after the transient , emphasizing the transient without increasing the level . Sustain The amount of amplification or attenuation of the sustained sound . Speed Higher values results in snappier transient modification , and lower values result in smoother curves . Clip When enabled , the output signal is clipped to 0dB . Sidechain When enabled transients are detected based on a secondary input , but the effect is applied to the main input . Settings panel Whenever you have your mouse cursor over a snapin there is a small arrow at the top right corner ( not visible in screenshot ) . It opens a settings panel where you handle presets .
It also has a `` randomize '' button that can be useful . I guess ... Enabled checkbox The small checkbox to the left of the plugin name is a checkbox that bypasses the effect when disabled . Resize handle The bottom right corner of all Kilohearts plugins is a resize handle for scaling the UI to any size . This allows you to get a good view of the controls whatever the screen resolution , and also comes in handy if you need big controls , e.g . when using Transient Shaper as a real-time effect on a touchscreen monitor during a live set . ( This is not available when the snapin is used inside a snapin host . )

David Price got back to winning ways on Saturday .
The former British and Commonwealth heavyweight champion admitted to nearly hanging up the gloves after their last defeat –– but now has a new lease of life .
Price said after defeat to Christian Hammer in February that they would n't box again and that they would return to work as a gas engineer .
But they just could n't keep away from the sport and returned at the Brentwood Centre in Essex , exclusively live on iFL TV .
They boxed for the first time under their new training team of former pros Derry Mathews and Joe McNally as well as Scouse boxing stalwart George Vaughan .
And it was a successful comeback for the man who still believes they can get to the upper echelons of the sport .
Price was up against Kamil Sokolowski of Poland on the MTK London card billed ‘ Pride & Glory ' and outpointed the Barnstaple-based man by 60 points to 54 .
“ I thought it was a good performance , ” Price , who was n't overcommitting and admitted to using the fight to get back into things , said afterwards . “ I got a good six rounds in the bank but the thing is I need to ring time .
“ Before my last fight , I had four rounds in two years and now I 'm looking to get another six- or eight-round fight under my belt in February , then a 10-rounder and then we 'll see what comes .
“ It 's not really my style to start calling people out but I want to step up . We know that there are fighters out there in a similar position to myself who would probably fancy the job against me , but I 'll just keep pushing on and if something comes then great . ”
There has been some interesting social media chat between Price and Tyson Fury recently –– and the 34-year-old said that a fight between them could happen if it was right .
“ Tyson and I were together the other day and from what I was told they have a lot of big plans , ” Price added . “ But I know that if Tyson Fury could give me the opportunity they would love to and I have a lot of respect for him .
“ Let 's make no bones about it , I 'm not on their level as a fighter , but a fight between us would still generate a lot of interest and we respect each other as men . ”
A former Billings Senior High School teacher who pleaded guilty to raping a 14-year-old student who later killed themselves has been sentenced to 30 days in jail by a judge who said the victim was `` older than their chronological age '' and `` as much in control of the situation '' as the teacher .
District Judge G. Todd Baugh sentenced Stacey Dean Rambold to 15 years in prison for sexual intercourse without consent , with all but 31 days suspended . They gave Rambold credit for one day already served , The Billings Gazette reported .
The girl 's mother repeatedly screamed , `` You people suck ! '' and stormed out of the courtroom Monday .
Rambold , now 54 , was charged in October 2008 with three counts of sexual intercourse without consent alleging that they had an ongoing sexual relationship with Cherice Morales , starting the previous year when they were 14 .
Morales took their own life in February 2010 while the case was pending .
In July 2010 , Rambold entered a three-year deferred prosecution agreement with prosecutors that said the charges would be dismissed if Rambold completed a sex offender treatment program and met other conditions , including having no contact with children . They also admitted to one rape charge .
The case was revived last December when prosecutors learned Rambold had been terminated from the sex offender treatment program .
Treatment provider Michael Sullivan said Rambold started missing meetings in August 2012 , but Sullivan said they met with Rambold and they appeared to be back on track with their treatment .
Rambold was terminated from the program in November when it was learned that they had been having unsupervised visits with minors , who were family members , and did not inform counselors that they had been having sexual relations with a woman .
Defense attorney Jay Lansing said Rambold has since continued their treatment with a different program and an evaluation found them at low risk to re-offend .
Baugh said they were not convinced that the reasons for Rambold 's termination from treatment were serious enough to warrant the 10-year prison term prosecutors recommended .
The judge said they listened to statements given by Morales before their death and believed that while they were a troubled youth , they were `` as much in control of the situation '' as Rambold and was `` older than their chronological age . ''
Yellowstone County Attorney Scott Twito told The Associated Press on Tuesday that they would not appeal the judge 's sentence .
`` We respect the court 's sentencing decision . We obviously disagree with it , based on the recommendations my attorneys made , but it appears to be legally permissible , '' they said .
Asked about Baugh 's reasoning that a 14-year-old girl below the state 's age of consent had an equal share of control of the relationship , Twito declined to answer directly .
`` The judge 's reasons are their reasons and their reasons alone . They have broad authority under state law , given the proper criteria , '' Twito said .
The case resulted in a $ 91,000 wrongful death settlement between the school district and Morales ' family .
Rambold reached a confidential settlement with the girl 's family .
It was after Pinochet 's coup in Chile that Paulo San Martin and their parents were granted asylum in East Germany . At school in Berlin , the six-year-old was seated next to Christian Lorenz , a clever kid and talented pianist who took Paulo under their wing . The two become friends .
For the last 10 years , Christian 'Flake ' Lorenz and Paulo San Martin have been on tour together almost without stopping . 'Flake ' is the keyboardist for Rammstein - six musicians from the former GDR , who stuck around in Berlin 's Prenzlauer Berg district after the fall of the Wall and set out to do something new and creative . They were after music that was as provocative as it was original - and , above all , angry .
'They want it ! '
Paulo San Martin , ready to point the way during a 2011 tour stop in Melbourne
Paulo San Martin is the band 's personal tour and production assistant . Day to day , that can mean putting up signs around the artists ' little village of trailers at an open air festival or getting costumes ready . Generally , San Martin has to ensure that all wishes go fulfilled and crises are averted .
`` For me , they 're friends ! '' said Paulo San Martin during a short pause in the band 's tour , adding , `` And they are very ambitious artists - which is to say musicians . Rockers ! They are very consistent . ''
The band has always been like that , the assistant says , even when they had no money , rehearsed like crazy and performed on weekends for free . `` You really noticed : They want it ! ''
380,000-watt autobiography
Rammstein : Six guys from Berlin 's Prenzlauer Berg
The band , with its 60 technicians , travels around the world like a circus . And they hire over 100 additional stagehands for each stop . Everyone has to know what 's to be done with the gigantic steel stage , 50 tons of equipment and a 380,000-watt system , resulting in a show that 's a mixture of light , fire , costumes and intricate props .
`` Rammstein works with theatrical elements that set the stage for six strong personalities . Not just with their outstanding use of effects and light . That goes for the lyrics too : they 've experienced a thing or two . Partly it 's about their personal views , partly about provocations they want to generate , '' San Martin says .
Ablaze
Keyboardist 'Flake ' rides a boat atop cheering fans
And the band 's songs are , indeed , full of explosive material : matricide , incest , S & M fantasies , life and death , blood and decay . Rammstein prefers the extremes , and you can hardly call their approach ambiguous . Meanwhile , they 've developed a certain knack for knowing when the air needs to burn or when a set of lyrics deserve a softer but macabre sense of romanticism .
Paulo San Martin has nothing but praise for Rammstein 's exaggerated artistic approach , saying , `` It fascinates me how they reach the audience - with their entire show and all around the world ! ''
In regions where fans do n't understand the words to the songs , they find translations . `` The people know what it 's about , '' the assistant confirms .
At the top
Metal lovers as far as the eye can see
It 's not seldom to see the band 's fans waiting for hours in the blistering sun for the overpowering dramaturgy of a Rammstein show to begin , with brutal rock music , unsettling silences , provocations and fountains of fire .
`` Ten a thousand in Madison Square Garden , New York City ! That 's when you think you 're really on top . What other German band can do that ? Kraftwerk . Way back the Scorpions . But otherwise , I do n't know . At that level ? Rammstein 's the only one in the world , '' says San Martin , evidently one of the band 's biggest fans .
'Rebellious anarchists '
Rammstein guitarist Paul Landers and Paulo San Martin
Part of what makes the shows run so well , Paulo San Martin says , is the band 's restless drive for perfection . `` It 's always a challenge to work with them because they 're never content . They improve their shows while on tour - everything from changing a little light bulb or a song to throwing out the whole set list . ''
It all makes for a hair-raising experience for the crew , but the group 's ingenuity is what die-hard fans adore about seeing Rammstein live - that and a good measure of pyrotechnics , of course .
Now that their mammoth world tour is finished , Paulo San Martin is ready for a break at home . Summing up the experience , they quote a journalist from the German daily `` Süddeutsche Zeitung '' who was along for the ride : `` Many , many hours with reflective , musical and , at their core , totally rebellious anarchists . ''
The US Navy has deployed the aircraft carrier ‘ Harry S. Truman ' to the Middle East , where it will help the US-led coalition launch strikes against the Islamic State terrorist group in Iraq and Syria .
Although the deployment of the nuclear-powered aircraft carrier has been scheduled for more than a year , according to the Navy Times , news of its departure comes in the wake of the Paris massacre that claimed the lives of at least 129 people . The Islamic State ( IS , also known as ISIS/ISIL ) has claimed responsibility .
The Truman 's deployment will last for seven months , the Washington Post reported . The carrier left Norfolk , Virginia on Monday and will arrive in the Persian Gulf in roughly six weeks . It is accompanied by the rest of the carrier strike group , which consists of the Carrier Air Wing Squadron 7 , Destroyer Squadron 28 , and the ships USS Anzio , USS Bulkeley , USS Gravely and the USS Gonzalez , according to The Hill .
US airstrikes destroy more than 100 # ISIS oil trucks in Syria https : //t.co/3w6vlX3mqjpic.twitter.com/snQGS15xoJ — RT America ( @ RT_America ) November 16 , 2015
`` The Harry S. Truman battle group will be there in due time and execute our mission successfully , '' Captain Ryan Scholl , the vessel 's skipper , told the Navy Times . `` We hope that brings some peace of mind to the people that are out there , both our coalition partners and our troops on the ground , and it brings a hard-to-swallow , deliberate pause in our enemy . ''
The Truman will arrive in the Middle East alongside France 's only aircraft carrier , the Charles de Gaulle , which is also set to deploy this week . The French have intensified their assault on IS since the violence in Paris over the weekend , striking numerous targets in the militant group 's stronghold in Raqqa , Syria .
`` We certainly extend our condolences to the French and look forward to supporting them as part of a coalition in any way that we can , '' said Rear Admiral Bret Batchelder , the Truman Carrier Strike Group 's commander , told the Navy Times . `` We are a barometer of national resolve . We are going to go where it is most important for our nation to send us , anywhere around the globe , and we do n't need a permission slip to operate there . That 's the value that we bring and we take great pride in that . ''

The previous American carrier taking part in the battle against IS , the USS Theodore Roosevelt , left the region last month to head to California . The Roosevelt was responsible for “ 1,812 combat sorties totaling 10,618 combat flight hours , taking on 14.5 million gallons of jet fuel and expending 1,085 precision-guided munitions , ” according to the US Naval Institute .
With the Roosevelt 's departure , the absence of carrier capabilities meant coalition forces were flying out of airbases in Turkey in order to strike militant targets .
The Truman 's deployment also comes as the US steps up its campaign against IS . On Monday , American airstrikes in Syria destroyed some 116 trucks that were being use by IS to smuggle crude oil . According to US officials , the attacks were part of a plan to target the militant group 's funding capabilities , as its oil operation reportedly rakes in about $ 40 million a month .

Ricky Brooks is perhaps the most interesting man in grassroots racing .
In a sub-discipline populated by former professionals , emerging prospects , gentleman drivers and the politically incorrect , Brooks has a personality that stands tall above the rest .
The outspoken 48-year-old has served as the technical director at 5 Flags Speedway in Pensacola , Florida , and its showcase Snowball Derby event for well over a decade . They have since expanded their résumé to include such prestigious races as the Florida Governor 's Cup , All-American 400 and the Winter Showdown .
Born the son of Gulf Coast racing legend Rex Brooks , Ricky carved out an impressive niche for themselves as a driver , winning a track championship at 5 Flags and even competing in four Snowball Derbies , with the best finish of eighth back in 1994 .
Those were simpler times , with the Brookses building their own equipment before costs spiraled out of control in the early 2000s . Unable to outspend big-budget teams , the younger Brooks took on several mechanical consultant jobs in North Carolina for a few years until longtime friend and Pensacola track promoter Tim Bryant offered them the job in 2004 .
“ I 'm completely self-taught , ” Brooks said . “ I enjoyed my time behind the wheel , and those memories with my dad were the most fun I 've had in racing—but the costs just pushed me away . But with that said , I really enjoy what I do now . ”
During their decade-plus as the most respected official in asphalt short-track racing , Brooks has lowered costs to the best of their ability as an inspector , generated widespread parity and was instrumental in the creation of a universal SLM ( Super Late Model ) compliance system that was adopted from coast to coast .
Ricky Brooks ' Snowball Derby tech line is affectionately knowns as the `` Room of Doom . ''
Having cemented their legacy in asphalt short-track racing , Brooks has begun to spread their reach to road racing as the new technical director for the Trans Am TA2 division , whose cars have similarities to Late Models . Brooks ' reputation made them the No . 1 hiring target for Trans Am president John Clagett .
“ We did not want someone who could just maintain the status quo or simply handle the work , ” said Clagett . “ We wanted a true expert for the class—someone who knows the ins and outs of this car and was capable of instituting a technical program that upholds the value that TA2 was founded under : cost control and driver competition . ”
But Brooks , while praised for their mechanical expertise , has earned a degree of criticism from some within the industry for their zero-tolerance policy that does n't provide much leeway or indulge those operating in the “ gray area ” of their rule book .
In their eyes , cars are either legal or they get disqualified—there is no middle ground .
The detractors accuse them of making the inspection process about himself . The Snowball Derby tech line has famously been called the “ Room of Doom , ” with Brooks and their staff wearing bright neon shirts adorned with the moniker .
There 's a bold-lettered , all-caps sign as cars approach the shed that reads “ IT IS WHAT IT IS ” to dismiss whining or excuse-making , with fans coming down from the stands to the inspection area to see who might get tossed next .
It 's the greatest spectacle in short-track racing .
But Brooks has always said they do n't enjoy disqualifying drivers . They would much rather see the story play itself out naturally on-track rather than during the inspection process . But they believe integrity is the most important element of motorsports .
Ricky Brooks has an eye for detail in their job as inpector for the Trans Am TA2 class .
“ I 've never made it about myself , ” Brooks said . “ If that were the case , I would n't give teams so much pre-tech . I give them every opportunity to pass . In fact , we do so much tech now just to make sure folks do n't get thrown out . You have to be pretty damn stupid or careless to get thrown out with this much tech. ” Yet , racers continue to do what racers are prone to do . And they get no leniency from Brooks . They have received the majority of their national attention from disqualifying the flagged winner of the Snowball Derby four times in the past 11 years . The most recent example was Christopher Bell 's weight-infraction disqualification in 2015 , which handed Chase Elliott their second Tom Dawson Memorial Trophy . Ironically , two years prior , it was Elliott that crossed the line first but was found to have an illegal piece of tungsten in their car . That gave fellow NASCAR youngster Erik Jones their second consecutive victory in the biggest short-track race of the year . Despite running afoul of Brooks in the past , Elliott appreciates the meticulous nature of their process and has n't been deterred from competing in their events in recent years . “ He 's always been consistent , and I respect that , ” Elliott said . “ Back when we failed tech in 2013 , that was our fault . That was a mistake , and it should n't have happened . And the bottom line is that if the shoe were on the other foot and someone else won the race but dd n't pass , I would want the same thing to play out for them . “ I respect Ricky and the fact that they are consistent with everything they do . They write the rules and expects us to stick to them . It would make the entire sport look bad if they let something slide. ” Brooks is n't afraid to throw out the biggest names in the industry , either .
Brooks keeps the TA2 field on a level playing field .
Both Elliott and Bell were in the genesis of their respective careers when they ran afoul of Brooks , but 2007 was the first time the Room of Doom was introduced to a national audience . That was the season Brooks banned Kyle Busch and Steven Wallace from the weekend after both qualified their way into the 40th running of the event .
Each driver had made the show through time trials , but Busch was tossed for failing to meet the minimum ride height requirement for the event . For Wallace , their car was found to be underweight when crossing the scales , but , per standard procedure , Wallace was given two more attempts to make weight . They only made the predicament worse when , during their second attempt , they were found to have stuffed sockets in their pockets , leading to an immediate dismissal from the event .
“ I was pissed because we gave them the benefit of the doubt , ” Brooks said . “ But that 's why we have to take these rules so seriously . If you do n't , there 's someone there to take advantage of them . ”
The story made national headlines and legitimized Brooks as a straight shooter who wo n't make exceptions for two NASCAR national touring notables . Popularity alone has never earned drivers a free pass in the Room of Doom .
Ironically , Busch told officials that they would never come back , but they did in 2009 and outright won the race . They passed tech , too . Wallace has been back several times since , as well . Driver grudges do n't seem to linger long against Brooks in the face of admitting that they failed for a reason .
“ We 've heard this story so many times , ” track promoter Bryant said . “ There have been so many drivers that have told me that they 'll never come back when they get tossed . And after a few years , they 're usually the ones to tell me that they 'll only come back if Ricky is performing tech . They demand accountability . ”
At the end of the day , this is what Brooks believes they were hired to do . They are n't going to loosen their policies .
“ I do n't think my critics are the racers , ” Brooks said . “ It 's usually people on Facebook or Twitter . They think I get a thrill from tossing cars , but racers generally get it and respect what we 're trying to do there .
“ Ask any racer and they 'll tell you they want it this way . Richie Wauters , Kyle Busch , Augie Grill or whoever . They want it to be fair and consistent . They tell me that when they 're not pissed at me for something in the moment . ”
So would Brooks , with their growing portfolio and penchant for disqualifying illegal cars , ever want to work for NASCAR ?
“ I wo n't say that I would n't but I wo n't say that I want to , either , ” Brooks said . “ I 'm not going to work somewhere that I would have my hands tied by politics . I 'm not going to be a puppet . I made that clear to Trans Am when they reached out . If we 're doing this , we 're going to do it the right way . ”
To Ricky Brooks , it 's about their way or the highway , and it 's a matter of integrity .
In other words : It is what it is .
Fortnite Battle Royale surpassed 810,000 concurrent players last weekend , prompting a number of matchmaking issues and periods of server downtime .
Developer Epic Games has since apologised , and has now outlined the areas it hopes to improve—such as client and server performance , tracking ping and packet loss across different regions , and dynamically routing traffic to data centres when matchmaking .
We 're sorry for the trouble this weekend . The Battle Bus had 811K concurrent players on Sunday . We 're working hard to keep it in the air.October 30 , 2017
Full details on what exactly Epic is casting its eye over can be read here , however here 's the most relevant breakdown for PC players on the development side :
Improve performance on min spec PC systems ( Nvidia GTX 460 , Radeon HD 5570 , Intel HD 4000 ) . This is an area where we made things worse recently , but took initial steps to correct in v1.8 . We 're not going to stop there .
Fix GPU hangs on PC and continue work with graphic card vendors such as NVIDIA , AMD , and Intel on improving performance and stability .
Reduce hitches during gameplay . We define a hitch as a frame that took more than 60 ms , resulting in an entire frame to be skipped . The goal here is to get to less than one per minute with focus on entirely eliminating hitches over 100 ms .
Fix remaining hitches on dedicated servers . E.g . a lot of players jumping late can result in rubber banding for players early on .
Optimize server performance of common actions like taking damage .
Identify source of hitches that are limited to first hour of releasing an update .
Optimize our server and network code to allow sending of player state to all 100 connections per frame . Right now we are updating 25 connections per frame in the lobby and 50 during the game . That means your play experience is n't where we want it to be till there are 50 players left . This is a major change that is running in parallel with other optimizations .
Improve our handling of edge cases that can result in wells of despair .
Improve our matchmaking system to dynamically route traffic to data centers within a region based on location . Basically have the ability to optimize for ping without taking away from the ability to play with friends .
Hire more smart people that are passionate about these sorts of technical challenges .
Epic also provides various tips for improving performance from the player 's end via the above-linked post .

Hillary Clinton absolutely eviscerated Donald Trump in a ferocious speech last week . As I listened , I could n't help but think , `` She 's going to win in a landslide . ''
Then I remembered the indictment hanging over their head .
It 's a familiar feeling — knowing about , then forgetting , then being reminded of Clinton 's many , many faults .
Last August , a few months into the low-boiling controversy surrounding Clinton 's use of an unsecured personal email server during their tenure as secretary of state , I penned an angry column calling them `` the Democratic Party 's ticking time bomb '' and predicting that some scandal — the emails , massive conflicts of interest at the multi-million-dollar slush-fund that goes by the name of The Clinton Foundation , their husband 's presence on the passenger manifest of a private plane ( nicknamed `` The Lolita Express '' ) owned by a billionaire who 'd pled guilty and served time for procuring underage prostitutes — would blow up between then and the November 2016 election . The only question , I predicted , was when it would happen : before the convention or after the convention ; before the debates or after the debates ; before the election or after the election .
But then something very unexpected happened : Donald Trump became the presumptive Republican nominee .
How could it be that the only thing standing in the way of Trump ascending to the presidency is a candidate so morally compromised that any number of possible scandals could easily derail their campaign at any moment ?
My unwillingness to accept this frightening reality led me to pen a recent column in which I rose in full-throated defense of Clinton against their Republican critics . Yes , they had faults . Sure , she 'd made mistakes . But the accusations against them were `` trivial , '' `` petty , '' `` penny-ante . '' At least compared to Trump 's massive faults . Faced with the prospect of giving the most powerful job in the world to a man grossly unsuited to it , the unwillingness of more # NeverTrump conservatives to throw their support to Clinton seemed peevish and irresponsible . These center-right critics needed to get over their qualms , acquire a sense of moral and political proportion , and embrace the only person standing in the way of a historic disaster .
Six days after I wrote that column , the inspector general 's office at the State Department issued its long-awaited report on Clinton 's email practices when they ran the department .
Tick-tick-BOOM .
It was bad . Very bad . And certainly much worse than `` trivial , '' `` petty , '' and `` penny-ante . '' Do n't believe me ? Read the fiery editorial published in the normally blander-than-unsalted-butter USA Today . The editorial says Clinton `` broke the rules '' by `` ignoring repeated warnings about email security . '' And so they did .
But what about breaking the law ? The Justice Department will be considering that question as soon as FBI director James Comey completes their investigation . Experts believe that `` it is difficult to imagine them not being indicted , unless Comey 's expected recommendation for that is abruptly overruled at 'Main Justice ' ( i.e. , by Criminal Division Assistant Attorney General Leslie Caldwell , by Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates , or by Attorney General Loretta Lynch ) or at the White House by President Obama ( who customarily does not intervene in such things and would do so here either secretly or at no small political peril ) . ''
In other words , there is a non-negligible chance of Clinton being indicted — of another time bomb detonating , this time with a much higher and more deadly yield .
If it happened before the Democratic National Convention , Bernie Sanders would presumably reap the benefits by becoming the party 's nominee .
If it happened after the convention but before the election , it 's hard to know what the party would do , since there would be no mechanism to decide . In one scenario , President Obama and the Democratic National Committee could tap Clinton 's running mate ( whoever it is ) to take over at the top of the ticket . In another , they could turn elsewhere , perhaps asking Joe Biden or ( God forbid ) John Kerry to jump in . ( Of course , the left wing of the party might rise up in outrage if Sanders or Elizabeth Warren were n't asked to take over . )
And then there 's the distinct possibility that Clinton , in the most thoroughly Clintonian act of all time , would put their own ambition ahead of the good of the party and the country by refusing to bow out and continuing to run while under indictment . This would be the political gift of the century to Trump in their contest with `` Crooked Hillary '' and could be one of the very few things that would guarantee their victory .
Or maybe not . It 's certainly possible to imagine Trump proving themselves so manifestly unelectable that Clinton somehow manages to prevail despite the indictment . In that case , the stage would be set for a criminal trial of a sitting president . Unless , of course , the outgoing president pardoned them That would spare the country an unprecedented ordeal , but it would also undermine even further the public 's already waning faith in the fairness of American institutions — and do nothing at all to prevent the incoming president 's immediate impeachment at the hands of a Republican Congress .
That , or something very much like it , may be what awaits us over the coming months — and all because the Democratic Party appears ready to choose as its nominee a candidate with an established record of poor judgment in both policy and personal matters .
Do I think a Clinton presidency would be anywhere near as disastrous for the country as a Trump presidency ? No , not even close . In that sense , I stand by what I wrote last month : Faced with these options , the choice for Clinton should be obvious to all .
But that does n't mean we should be happy about it — or blind ourselves to the likely consequences .
This week marks the first anniversary of the death of Zaha Hadid , the most successful and influential female architect in the architectural discipline . Born in Baghdad ( Iraq ) in 1950 , Hadid became the first woman to receive the Pritzker Prize in 2004 , and twelve years later received the gold medal from the Royal Institute of British Architects ( RIBA ) .
Hadid 's untimely death left a fascinating and inspiring legacy . Meanwhile their firm , Zaha Hadid Architects , continues to work on nearly a hundred projects worldwide . To remember their legacy , Spanish company Deimos Imaging has shared a series of photographs focusing on Hadid 's work in five countries .
The images were captured by the Deimos-2 satellite , which was launched in 2014 and designed for very high-resolution Earth observation applications , providing multispectral images of just 75 centimeters per pixel . Hadid 's incredible works take on a new dimension when you contemplate their proportions from the sky—or rather , from a satellite .

The Dongdaemun Design Plaza is an ultramodern aluminum-plated structure that pops up in the middle of a historical district of Seoul which is famous for its 24-hour cafes and shops . This curved structure—whose name literally means the Great Eastern Gate—is a cultural hub that includes a great variety of public spaces such as Exhibition Halls , a Design Museum and Labs , an Academy Hall , and a Media Center , among many other functions .
Dongdaemun Design Plaza is the first public project in Korea that used 3-Dimensional Building Information Modelling ( BIM ) to ensure its efficiency , quality , and cost-effectiveness . BIM enabled the designers to have a greater control of details and to visualize the outcomes much better than the traditional 2D drawings .

Intoxicated and slurring their words , Mayor Rob Ford had security guards bring an unknown woman to their deserted city hall office on Easter Monday , the day of the building 's annual power shutdown . Two hours later , Ford was still so unsteady that they could be “ seen stumbling and even falling on the ground ” in the parking garage , a security guard said in an incident report . Ford , struggling , had to be physically helped into their Cadillac Escalade by guard Mike Toolaram .

Councillor Doug Ford waited behind the wheel . They had come to the building at 9:40 p.m. to pick their brother up . The Star obtained the incident report , and some of the associated surveillance footage , via freedom of information law . Notably , the city kept secret the name of the security guard who wrote the report — on the grounds that “ the disclosure could reasonably be expected to endanger the life or physical safety of a law enforcement officer or any other person. ” No explanation was provided for that claim . But the incident occurred just over a month after Ford showed up at city hall on St. Patrick 's Day weekend and allegedly made an intoxicated threat to “ get ” the security guard who had reported their intoxication at city hall on the same holiday two years prior .

The new information about the April 21 incident adds to the public understanding of the events leading up to Ford 's ongoing leave of absence , which they announced nine days later . Ford was filmed smoking what appeared to be crack cocaine on April 26 . On April 28 , they were recorded making lewd and racist remarks at an Etobicoke bar . On April 5 , they made a late-night visit to city hall with two strangers they had just met on the sidewalk after a Maple Leafs game , at which they were warned by security for being “ belligerent. ” Soon after that incident , Ford told reporters that they come to city hall at night “ all the time. ” They added : “ I can do whatever I want . It 's my office. ” The narrative offered by the Easter Monday security report began at 7:50 p.m. , when an unidentified woman buzzed the security desk from an employee entrance and said they were there to see the mayor . The building is empty every Easter Monday except for security guards and a smattering of other workers : the city shuts down the power for electrical maintenance . City officials believe the electricity was back on by the time the woman arrived , but almost nobody was around .
The guard who received the woman 's intercom call knocked on the door of the mayor 's office . They were greeted there by Ford and Toolaram . “ I had asked the mayor if they were expecting a visitor by the name of ( redacted ) at which point they replied by saying ‘ bring them up , ' ” the guard wrote . “ The mayor appeared to be intoxicated as they were slurring their words , red in the face , and sweating profusely . ”

The woman left at 8:40 p.m. , the guard wrote . Security footage provided in response to the Star 's records request did not include images of the woman . At 9:40 p.m. , Doug Ford buzzed the security desk from a different entrance . They said they had forgotten their employee access pass and needed to be granted entry . Security footage from 9:50 p.m. showed Toolaram and the two Fords walking toward the garage . The mayor pointed forward with their left hand and nudged their brother 's back with a clipboard they held in the right . Ford got into the Escalade at 9:52 p.m. About 20 seconds later , though , they opened the door and leaned over . Toolaram returned to their side ; Doug Ford , their campaign manager , remained behind the wheel , their hand briefly on their forehead . The door stayed open for one minute . The camera , obstructed by the door , zoomed in on Ford 's feet , which twisted unevenly on the garage floor . Ford , who was neither standing straight nor sitting , appeared to be guided back into the vehicle by Toolaram . Doug Ford started driving at 9:55 p.m. , but the Escalade came close to scraping the low ceiling of the garage . Ford then reversed and turned around . “ They were instructed by Toolaram to exit via EMPLOYEE IN as the vehicle was too large to make it down the TAXI OUT ramp , ” the guard concluded . “ At approximately 2155HRS the vehicle was off-site and driving south on Bay St. ” The security report did not describe the mayor 's state upon their arrival that day . It also did not say what time the mayor arrived . The power appears to have remained off in parts of the building until late afternoon . “ Staff are encouraged to use alternate city locations if they need to do some work . Staff will likely not be turned away by security , but they will not have the ability to use computers etc . Typically staff stay away since they know this , ” facilities operations manager Linda Kelland said on Monday . Easter Monday is at least the second instance in which Ford had an unknown woman in their office on a holiday . Their former communications director , Isaac Ransom , told police the mayor was drinking in their office on St. Patrick 's Day of 2012 with a woman who “ may have been an escort or prostitute. ” Ford angrily rejected that suggestion . “ It hurts my wife when they 're calling a friend of mine a prostitute , ” they said in November . “ Alana is not a prostitute . She 's a friend , and it makes me sick how people are saying this. ” Doug Ford and the mayor 's chief of staff , Dan Jacobs , did not respond to requests for comment on Thursday afternoon ; Jacobs is working for Deputy Mayor Norm Kelly as the mayor seeks treatment in Muskoka for what they say is a problem with alcohol . Doug Ford says the mayor plans to return to the city on June 30 or July 1 .

Patricia Campatelli often worked only 15 hours a week at their $ 122,500-a-year job as Suffolk County register of probate , and they spent much of that time taking “ numerous smoking breaks , scratching lottery tickets , looking at East Boston real estate on the Internet , and filling out puzzles , ” according to employees quoted in a confidential report obtained by the Globe .
Even before the embattled Campatelli was accused of punching an employee in the face , they had “ created a fearful atmosphere ” in the office , retaliating against workers who questioned their long breaks and plotting to get rid of employees so they could hire their own people , concluded court-appointed investigator Ronald P. Corbett Jr .
Corbett 's report , which has been forwarded to a committee of the Supreme Judicial Court for possible disciplinary action , takes the showdown between Campatelli and court officials to a new level . Campatelli has insisted that because they are an elected official court administrators have no power over them and only the SJC — or the voters — can discipline them

Campatelli , on paid administrative leave since Jan. 14 while Corbett investigated allegations of abusive behavior , flatly denied all the charges . But Corbett did not believe her , concluding that Campatelli worked too little , violated the court 's sexual harassment policy , and used their position to punish people they did not like .

“ It simply is not credible that so many employees would falsely report so many specific and similar details , ” wrote Corbett in their March 3 report to top court administrators . “ I conclude that the Register did not respond truthfully to material questions I asked her . ”
Corbett said they could not sort out the facts behind Campatelli 's alleged Dec. 18 assault on longtime employee Timothy Perry , noting that both had been drinking heavily at two bars prior to the incident and that Perry had been in one detail inconsistent in recounting their story to others at the time .
However , Corbett said , Campatelli showed “ poor judgment ” by drinking so much at a Christmas party and “ a fundamental inability to understand that , as the Suffolk County Register of Probate , they should be a dignified figure at a public party involving their staff rather than a drinking companion . ”
Campatelli , a Democrat who was first elected in November 2012 and is running for reelection against four opponents , has dismissed the Corbett report as “ nonsense . There 's no sworn testimony . It 's garbage with no dates , ” they said , noting that Corbett would not tell them the names of the employees who were criticizing them

“ I do n't have a lie in me , ” they told the Globe last week , adding that Corbett “ insulted me to no end . ”
Philip R. Boncore , Campatelli 's attorney , declined to comment on the report except to say it “ does not show willful malfeasance or misconduct . ”
Boncore said they intend to go to court to fight their continued suspension on the grounds that court administrators have no disciplinary authority over them
In their nine-page report , Corbett painted a picture of a vengeful and vulgar boss who did not understand the basics of their job and was not interested in learning them . Employees said they failed to attend numerous training sessions and , even when they did go , “ arrived late and left early . ”
Campatelli “ typically ” showed up for work only three days a week and even then put in only “ abbreviated days ” that ended around 3 p.m. , employees said .

Campatelli , in an interview with Corbett , insisted they worked a full 37.5-hour week and that , when they were not in the office , they were attending wakes and funerals , making hospital visits , or “ seeing constituents during . . . smoke breaks . '' Those smoking breaks , employees said , happened several times each day and lasted up to 30 minutes at a time .
They admitted scratching lottery tickets at work , but said the “ whole office did that , ” and argued that they did so only during breaks .
They also said that they had attended trainings , shadowed their employees to understand their duties , and read about new laws that affect their office . In addition , Campatelli said , they answered phones , pulled files and sat at the front desk , an assertion one employee called “ malarkey , ” Corbett reported , while another said Campatelli “ does positively nothing . ”
Employees also said they often used vulgar , demeaning , or sexual language at work . One worker said they dropped “ f-bombs ” in the office , and once used especially vulgar language when referring to a sexual relationship between two staff members .
Another staffer who brought a female friend with them to the Christmas party reported that Campatelli pulled them aside and said : “ I knew you were [ having sex with ] her . ”
Campatelli denied using inappropriate language in the office .
Some employees said Campatelli had favorites in the office , generally the workers who were in the “ smoking club , ” and took breaks with them They were allowed to carry lighter workloads , some employees reported , frustrating others who had to do more .
Campatelli intimidated employees and looked for ways to force people out so they could make their own hires , some said . They asked some older workers when they were retiring and tried to fabricate negative work records to justify terminating others , Corbett wrote .
They once told a staff member to “ write someone up , ” saying , “ I need your help to get rid of him , ” Corbett wrote .
Two workers apparently learned the hard way not to criticize Campatelli about their smoking breaks : Campatelli allegedly threatened to take away a special bonus one was collecting . The other got an “ icy stare ” and was later written up for sick leave violations , Corbett wrote .
“ If you are not with me , I 'll bury you , ” a worker quoted them as saying .
Campatelli denied threatening any employees or trying to force anyone out .
Corbett said that of all the dozens of employees they interviewed , only Campatelli seemed untruthful .
“ I could not conclude that they were being honest and forthright , ” they wrote .
Corbett , who made no recommendations , urged court officials to act quickly on Campatelli 's case because they are still being paid .
Last week , Paula Carey , chief justice of the Trial Court , referred the report to the Committee on Professional Responsibility for Clerks of the Court , which investigates allegations of misconduct involving clerks or registers .
The committee has historically taken months or even years to reach a decision . It removed Middlesex County Register of Probate Robert B. Antonelli in 1999 . But it took two years before Antonelli was ousted for mistreating employees .
For their part , Campatelli said they just wants to get back to the job they were elected to do .
“ I 'm still working every day . People call me on my cellphone looking for help , ” they said last week , adding that despite the controversy , “ I 'm convinced I 'll win again . ”

The fifth variable that I will be manipulating across a two week period to examine its impact on sleep is the importance of giving ourselves time to relax and wind down before sleep .
I will discuss what my data shows , how easy or difficult I found this strategy to implement , and what previous research says . These three factors will be combined for an overall score and grade on how effective winding down and relaxing before bedtime is at helping people to improve their sleep .
How much time do you take each day to do nothing ? To merely be , rather than always having to do something ? To put your feet up and just relax ?
For me , the answer is a lot more than I used to . I remember back when I was completing my Doctorate in Clinical Psychology , I would finish up my day of placement at Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre and walk through the Fitzroy Gardens on the way to Jolimont train station . It was a beautiful way to end my work day with a brisk walk and lovely scenery , but the thing that always amazed me was the number of people that were laying around , reading a book or chatting with friends . “ Where do they find the time ? ” I would ask myself in amazement , as I checked my phone to make sure that I would n't be late for the next train .
A Doctorate is a great way to become more self-disciplined and efficient , as it involves trying to juggle coursework with research , writing a thesis and clinical placement . It is n't great for a work/life balance , however , as even after a full day of work and study it always felt like there was a copious amount of work that still needed to be done .
Once my thesis was finally accepted in February 2014 I remember walking through those same gardens after a day of work at the Melbourne Sleep Disorders Centre and noticed that there were still people out and about , exploring the garden paths with their kids or having a picnic under a tree . “ Where do they find the time ? ” I asked myself again .
I was now working full-time in private practice as a Clinical Psychologist , and in general , I was feeling more relaxed and less rushed , but always felt like there were more things that needed to be done that were more important than lying around in the park on a weekday afternoon .
Now I 'm only working four days a week and I finally get it . It 's a trap to keep waiting until we find the time to do something . We have to make the time to do it . Just ask time management expert Laura Vanderkam :
So last Monday , on my usual day off , I decided to go back to Fitzroy Gardens again . Instead of walking briskly like I used to do I now strolled , found a nice spot , and laid back on the grass , staring up at the sky . Thoughts of lying back on my trampoline when I was younger and trying to make out shapes in the clouds came rushing back to me , and I began to just take in my surroundings and relax even though I was only five minutes away from all the hustle and bustle of the city .
After 30 minutes of relaxing , I carried on with my day , much less frantic and hurried than I used to be only a few years before .
Hyper-Arousal
There are three main things that I look at during an assessment of a client with sleeping difficulties . Firstly , their sleep pressure and if this is high enough each night when they are going to bed . Secondly , their circadian rhythms and if they are in bed at the right times based on their internal body clock . The last factor is hyper-arousal , or how active their brains are during the day and at night .
Hyper-arousal tends to be the main problem for the majority of individuals that I see with chronic insomnia . By the time they come to see me , they have generally tried as many of the sleep hygiene instructions that they can and are getting more and more frustrated and worried that their sleep is n't improving . What they often do n't realise is that this frustration and worry are only further elevating their nocturnal hyper-arousal , and it is preventing them from getting the very thing that they desire – a nice , deep , restful and restorative sleep .
Cognitive arousal , or a busy mind , is ten times more likely to be rated as the reason for sleep difficulties by patients with insomnia than physical arousal , or a tense and restless body . Given how much information people are exposed to these days , and how little they tend to move , this does n't surprise me at all . Just think about how many people you see on their phones wherever you go . I even saw someone checking their phone whilst skateboarding the other day .
What would happen if we all decided to do less ? If we took some time out during the day to power down , do nothing and just be ? If we all stopped trying to work and achieve for at least the last hour before bed each night and focused instead on winding down , relaxing and preparing our mind and body for sleep ?
The Experiment
For the first week , I stopped doing any form of “ work ” at least two hours before bed . This meant four nights of watching Netflix on TV ( with blue-light blocking glasses on ) , one night of reading , and two nights of guided meditation using the phone app calm .
For the second week , I made sure that I did n't do anything specific to wind down , and did work on the computer ( with f.lux on ) on the five weeknights ( Sun-Thur ) . On the weekend I did n't have the chance to do work as I was away at a Bachelor or Buck 's Party but did socialise right up to bedtime without actively trying to do anything to wind down .
The Outcome
Comparison : Working right up until bedtime vs winding down and relaxing before bed
Subjectively , I woke up nearly three times as much by working right up until bedtime . I still managed to get 7 hours of sleep per night and fell asleep in under 10 minutes once in bed . I also had a sleep efficiency of 96.55 % , which is excellent , but I went to bed 18 minutes later , took longer to fall asleep , and spent more time awake during the night . The only thing that was better on the week where I worked right up to bedtime was my rising time in the morning , as I got out of bed 8 minutes earlier each day .
By taking the time to wind down and relax before sleep my sleep quality was the second best it has been all year ( no alcohol was better ) and I slept 31 minutes more per night . The 7 hours and 31 minutes of sleep that I obtained on average in the week that I stopped working and relaxed before sleep was 15 minutes more than I had obtained in any other week this year !
Objectively , the depth of my sleep was much better during the first week when I was winding down than when I was working right up until bedtime .
Let 's compare Mar 17 ( 16/3/17 on the sleep diary ) to March 20 ( 19/3/17 on the sleep diary data ) . Granted , I did have to run an all-day workshop on sleep on Monday , which I was a bit nervous about . This did seem to make my sleep more restless , and I slept an hour less than the Thursday before when I had meditated before bed .
Even though I was only in bed for an extra hour after meditating , I obtained 2.5 hours more restful sleep , as you can see for yourself on the Misfit Ray data above . The objective difference in sleep quality is important for daytime functioning , mood and energy levels , and it suggests that mindfulness meditation is worth exploring further .
IS STOPPING WORK AND WINDING DOWN BEFORE BED A GOOD SLEEP STRATEGY ?
EFFECTIVENESS
Yes . Notice how with this technique I mixed up how I wound down and also mixed up the work that I did , but in general taking some time out before sleep to relax was very effective in improving my sleep , especially my sleep quality and total sleep time . I , therefore , give the effectiveness of this strategy a 22/25 .
APPLICABILITY
For me , the flexibility of this strategy is great , as I do n't have to do exactly the same thing every night and can fit in with others too ( as long as I find it relaxing ) . I , therefore , give the applicability of this strategy a 23/25 . All you have to do is stop trying to be productive right up to bedtime , and actually , give your mind a chance to wind down in the last hour before bed .
SCIENCE
In Perlis and colleagues ' ( 1997 ) neurocognitive model of insomnia , they say that hyper-arousal interferes with both sleep initiation and sleep maintenance . They also say that people with insomnia develop conditioned cortical ( mental ) arousal from the association of sleep-related stimuli and sleep difficulties ( Perlis et al. , 1997 ) .
In Espie 's ( 2002 ) psychobiological model of insomnia , they say that normal sleep processes are disrupted , resulting in difficulties disengaging from active wake processes . This leads to higher cortical arousal and lack of inhibition of arousal ( Espie , 2002 ) .
Kleiner and Pavalko ( 2010 ) have found that individuals who work over 41 hours a week report worse mental and physical health . Other studies have found a link between long working hours and stress , poor sleep , depression , anxiety , increased alcohol use , coronary heart disease and potentially even cancer ( Heikkila et al. , 2016 ) .
By reducing the working hours of medical interns , Lockley and colleagues ( 2004 ) found that weekly sleep times increased by 5.8 hours and the rate of attentional failures during night shifts was more than halved .
I , therefore , give the science of this strategy a 40/50 .
Overall , reducing work-time and winding down in the two hours before bed as a way to sleep better gets a score of 22/25 + 23/25 + 40/50 =
85/100 : High Distinction
WHAT I RECOMMEND
Hyper-arousal , especially an active mind , is the # 1 reason that individuals with insomnia can not sleep .
It does n't matter how this arousal level is lowered , or how you choose to wind down and relax , but preferably you do n't want it to disrupt your circadian rhythms , so minimising bright screen use in the last two hours before bed is advisable .
Apart from that , experiment a bit . Socialising with others is okay , as is reading , listening to music , doing some light stretching , engaging in a relaxing hobby , having a hot bath ( 30-60 minutes before bedtime ) or meditating . Find what works for you , and then try to develop a bit of a wind-down routine each night to see if this helps your sleep .
It is also important to make sure that you are not working too much ( if this is possible ) . Anything more than 9 hours per day or 48 hours per week is likely to lead to poorer self-care and poorer health , and it is also likely to reduce your productivity whilst working . Sweden has dropped down to 6-hour work days , and in time we 'll hopefully see the health benefits that this brings .
Lastly , try not to focus too much on sleep , or worry about the negative impacts of not sleeping . The more attention that we have on it , the greater effort that we put into it and the greater intent that we have towards getting to sleep , the less likely it is to come . Sleep is an involuntary process , which means that there will never be a strategy that offers a 100 % guarantee that you will sleep well tonight . It 's much better to focus on relaxing and lowering our arousal before bed , waiting until we feel sleepy before going to bed , and then allowing sleep to come .

Louis Freeh was appointed by a judge to conduct an independent investigation into the settlement programme , which is paying out compensation for the 2010 disaster on BP 's behalf .
Despite finding “ pervasive ” improper and unethical conduct by some senior lawyers in the scheme , Mr Freeh said the evidence was not enough to merit halting all payments from the fund - something BP has repeatedly called for .
BP has launched a number of separate appeals on various grounds to try to halt the payments from the fund , which are spiralling billions of dollars above the $ 7.8bn it estimated when it signed the deal last year .
Costs are now $ 9.6bn and rising , threatening to push BP 's total bill for the disaster well above $ 42.4bn .
Mr Freeh found that two attorneys working on the claims programme “ may have violated the federal criminal statutes regarding fraud , money laundering , conspiracy or perjury ” and recommended US authorities consider pressing charges against them .
They cleared Patrick Juneau , the man in charge of the scheme , of misconduct but found that “ many of their key executives and senior attorneys ” acted in an improper or unethical way .
Geoff Morrell , BP spokesperson , said the report “ confirms what BP has suspected for some time : there has been fraud and unethical conduct within the facility itself and among various claimants and their lawyers – and immediate steps need to be taken to prevent it in the future ” .
They called the evidence “ shocking ” and said it showed that “ neither BP nor the public has had any idea of what 's really going on ” in the programme .
Mr Juneau said Mr Freeh 's report validated their team 's work and they played down the alleged misconduct by two former members of their staff as an “ isolated situation . ”
“ We will continue the job of processing claims , ” they said . `` We welcome the recommendations from the Freeh report and we look forward to working with them to help improve all aspects of the claims process . ''
The report found that two private attorneys - Glen Lerner and Jon Andry - used Lionel Sutton , a lawyer on Juneau 's staff , to speed up a claim by their firm for nearly $ 8m ( £5.1m ) . In return , Mr Sutton received more than $ 40,000 in fees from payments on claims they had referred to their law firm before joining Juneau 's staff , the report said .
Mr Freeh recommended turning over their report to the Justice Department and the US Attorney 's Office to determine whether Mr Sutton , Mr Lerner , Mr Andry or Mr Sutton 's wife Christine Reitano , who also worked as a lawyer on Mr Juneau 's staff , violated any federal laws `` regarding fraud , money laundering and conspiracy . ''
They also recommended that the court consider disallowing the $ 7.9 million payment of The Andry Law Firm claim based on `` long-held principles of equity which prohibit a party before the court to benefit and enrich itself after having engaged in dishonest , unethical and improper conduct . ''
`` In this matter , the conduct of The Andry Law Firm is particularly egregious , '' the report said . `` In effect , Mr. Jon Andry 's AndryLerner firm was making secret , improper payments to Mr. Sutton at the precise time Mr. Sutton was a senior CAO attorney , working in concert with Mr. Jon Andry to expedite payment of The Andry Law Firm claim . ''
Michael Walsh , an attorney for Lionel Sutton , said Mr Freeh 's allegations about their client 's conduct possibly warranting a criminal probe are `` absolutely unfounded . ''
`` There was no criminal activity on Mr. Sutton 's part , '' Mr Walsh told the Associated Press . `` If Mr Sutton had done anything criminally wrong , they would not have co-operated with Mr . Freeh . ''
James Cobb , a lawyer for Andry , said their client has n't done anything wrong and does n't deserve to be smeared by Freeh .
`` It appears to me that Mr. Freeh reached a conclusion first and then worked their way backwards , citing facts which are unsupported in the record , '' Mr Cobb told AP .
Lawyers for Mr Lerner and Mr Reitano could not be reached for comment .
Mr Sutton resigned from their job at the settlement program in June , while Mrs Reitano was sacked later the same month . They have demanded to be reinstated , and insisted they have done nothing wrong .
“ We must believe before we can doubt , and doubt before we can deny , ” W.H . Auden observed in their commonplace book . Half a century earlier , Bertrand Russell ( May 18 , 1872–February 2 , 1970 ) , the great poet laureate of reason , addressed the central equation of free thinking in their 1922 Conway Memorial Lecture , later published as Free Thought and Official Propaganda ( public library | free ebook ) — a short and searing book charged with Russell 's characteristic intellectual electricity , the immense power of which melts an entire century into astonishing timeliness speaking directly to the present day .
Three decades before they were awarded the Nobel Prize for “ his varied and significant writings in which they champion humanitarian ideals and freedom of thought , ” Russell writes :
When we speak of anything as “ free , ” our meaning is not definite unless we can say what it is free from . Whatever or whoever is “ free ” is not subject to some external compulsion , and to be precise we ought to say what this kind of compulsion is . Thus thought is “ free ” when it is free from certain kinds of outward control which are often present . Some of these kinds of control which must be absent if thought is to be “ free ” are obvious , but others are more subtle and elusive .
Writing three years after the magnificent Declaration of the Independence of the Mind , which they signed alongside luminaries like Albert Einstein and Jane Addams , Russell points to two primary meanings of “ free thought ” — the narrower sense of resisting traditional dogma and a broader sense that encompasses all forms of propaganda pervading public life . A patron saint of nonbelievers , Russell writes :
I am myself a dissenter from all known religions , and I hope that every kind of religious belief will die out . I do not believe that , on the balance , religious belief has been a force for good . Although I am prepared to admit that in certain times and places it has had some good effects , I regard it as belonging to the infancy of human reason , and to a stage of development which we are now outgrowing . But there is also a wider sense of “ free thought , ” which I regard as of still greater importance . Indeed , the harm done by traditional religions seems chiefly traceable to the fact that they have prevented free thought in this wider sense .
They consider the three essential elements of this wider conception of free thought :
Thought is not “ free ” when legal penalties are incurred by the holding or not holding of certain opinions , or by giving expression to one 's belief or lack of belief on certain matters… The most elementary condition , if thought is to be free , is the absence of legal penalties for the expression of opinions . [ … ] Legal penalties are , however , in the modern world , the least of the obstacles to freedom of thoughts . The two great obstacles are economic penalties and distortion of evidence . It is clear that thought is not free if the profession of certain opinions makes it impossible to earn a living . It is clear also that thought is not free if all the arguments on one side of a controversy are perpetually presented as attractively as possible , while the arguments on the other side can only be discovered by diligent search .
Echoing the essence of Descartes 's twelve tenets of critical thinking , penned three centuries earlier , Russell returns to the centerpiece of free thought — the willingness to doubt :
William James used to preach the “ will to believe. ” For my part , I should wish to preach the “ will to doubt. ” None of our beliefs are quite true ; all have at least a penumbra of vagueness and error . The methods of increasing the degree of truth in our beliefs are well known ; they consist in hearing all sides , trying to ascertain all the relevant facts , controlling our own bias by discussion with people who have the opposite bias , and cultivating a readiness to discard any hypothesis which has proved inadequate .
Half a century before Richard Feynman 's terrific meditation on science vs. religion and why doubt is essential for morality , Russell extols science as the domain of human knowledge that best exemplifies the fruitfulness of this “ will to doubt ” :
Every man of science whose outlook is truly scientific is ready to admit that what passes for scientific knowledge at the moment is sure to require correction with the progress of discovery ; nevertheless , it is near enough to the truth to serve for most practical purposes , though not for all . In science , where alone something approximating to genuine knowledge is to be found , men 's attitude is tentative and full of doubt . In religion and politics , on the contrary , though there is as yet nothing approaching scientific knowledge , everybody considers it de rigueur to have a dogmatic opinion , to be backed up by inflicting starvation , prison , and war , and to be carefully guarded from argumentative competition with any different opinion . If only men could be brought into a tentatively agnostic frame of mind about these matters , nine-tenths of the evils of the modern world would be cured . War would become impossible , because each side would realize that both sides must be in the wrong . Persecution would cease . Education would aim at expanding the mind , not at narrowing it . Men would be chosen for jobs on account of fitness to do the work , not because they flattered the irrational dogmas of those in power .
They point Einstein and the relativity theory they had formulated just seven years earlier as an epitome of this disposition :
Their theory upsets the whole theoretical framework of traditional physics ; it is almost as damaging to orthodox dynamics as Darwin was to Genesis . Yet physicists everywhere have shown complete readiness to accept their theory as soon as it appeared that the evidence was in its favour . But none of them , least of all Einstein himself , would claim that they have said the last word… This critical undogmatic receptiveness is the true attitude of science .
Indeed , we have seen a supreme testament to this in the recent landmark detection of gravitational waves — something Einstein saw as a purely theoretical concept of unimaginable empirical corroboration .
Russell offers a disquieting thought experiment of sorts :
If Einstein had advanced something equally new in the sphere of religion or politics … the truth or falsehood of their doctrine would be decided on the battlefield , without the collection of any fresh evidence for or against it . This method is the logical outcome of William James 's will to believe . What is wanted is not the will to believe , but the wish to find out , which is its exact opposite .
They consider the core obstacles to this vital rational doubt :
A great deal of this is due to the inherent irrationality and credulity of average human nature . But this seed of intellectual original sin is nourished and fostered by other agencies , among which three play the chief part — namely , education , propaganda , and economic pressure .
Russell examines each of the three in turn , beginning with education — a subject they would come to consider closely four years later in their masterwork on education and the good life . Education 's formal institutions , they argue , are set up “ to impart information without imparting intelligence ” and designed “ not to give true knowledge , but to make the people pliable to the will of their masters ” — a seedbed of political and cultural propaganda that begins in elementary school , with the teaching of a history told by those in power , and results in the widespread manipulation of public opinion . Lamenting “ the paradoxical fact that education has become one of the chief obstacles to intelligence and freedom of thought , ” they envision the remedy :
Education should have two objects : first , to give definite knowledge — reading and writing , languages and mathematics , and so on ; secondly , to create those mental habits which will enable people to acquire knowledge and form sound judgments for themselves . The first of these we may call information , the second intelligence .
They then turns to propaganda — the concerted manipulation of public opinion by those in power . Having previously advocated for the blurring of the line between intuition and the intellect , they write :
Too much fuss is sometimes made about the fact that propaganda appeals to emotion rather than reason . The line between emotion and reason is not so sharp as some people think . [ … ] The objection to propaganda is not only its appeal to unreason , but still more the unfair advantage which it gives to the rich and powerful . Equality of opportunity among opinions is essential if there is to be real freedom of thought ; and equality of opportunity among opinions can only be secured by elaborate laws directed to that end , which there is no reason to expect to see enacted . The cure is not to be sought primarily in such laws , but in better education and a more sceptical public opinion .
Turning to the final impediment of free thought — the economic pressures of conformity , under which one is rewarded for siding with and adopting the dogmas of those in power — Russell writes :
There are two simple principles which , if they were adopted , would solve almost all social problems . The first is that education should have for one of its aims to teach people only to believe propositions when there is some reason to think that they are true . The second is that jobs should be given solely for fitness to do the work .
Nearly a century after Kierkegaard argued for the power of the minority and a generation before Hannah Arendt 's case for outsiderdom , Russell urges :
The protection of minorities is vitally important ; and even the most orthodox of us may find themselves in a minority some day , so that we all have an interest in restraining the tyranny of majorities . Nothing except public opinion can solve this problem .
It 's a sentiment of enormous poignancy and prescience , illustrating both how far we 've come — Russell is writing more than three decades before the zenith of civil rights and the Equal Pay Act — and how far we have yet to go in a culture where , a century later , sexism and racism are far from gone and many workplaces are still systematically discriminating against minorities like Muslims and the LGBT community .
The cultivation of public opinion that advances equality and justice rather than upholding oppressive power structures has to do with the “ will to doubt ” at the heart of Russell 's case . They write :
Some element of doubt is essential to the practice , though not to the theory , of toleration… If there is to be toleration in the world , one of the things taught in schools must be the habit of weighing evidence , and the practice of not giving full assent to propositions which there is no reason to believe true .
The role of the educator , they argue , is to teach young minds how to infer what actually happened “ from the biased account of either side ” and to instill in them the awareness that “ everything in newspapers is more or less untrue ” — a task all the more urgent today , when the old role of the newspapers has been largely taken over by incessant opinion-streams barraging us online and off with the certitude of their respective version of reality masquerading as truth .
Russell returns to the basic human predicament obstructing freedom of thought and envisions its only fruitful solution :
The evils of the world are due to moral defects quite as much as to lack of intelligence . But the human race has not hitherto discovered any method of eradicating moral defects ; preaching and exhortation only add hypocrisy to the previous list of vices . Intelligence , on the contrary , is easily improved by methods known to every competent educator . Therefore , until some method of teaching virtue has been discovered , progress will have to be sought by improvement of intelligence rather than of morals . One of the chief obstacles to intelligence is credulity , and credulity could be enormously diminished by instruction as to the prevalent forms of mendacity .
Writing nearly a century ago , even before Walter Benjamin 's increasingly timely meditation on the challenge of extracting wisdom from the morass of ( mis ) information , Russell once again reveals their extraordinary prescience :
Credulity is a greater evil in the present day than it ever was before , because , owing to the growth of education , it is much easier than it used to be to spread misinformation , and , owing to democracy , the spread of misinformation is more important than in former times to the holders of power .
They conclude by considering what it would take for us to implement these two pillars of free thought — an education system that fosters critical thinking rather than conformity and a meritocratic workforce where jobs are earned based on acumen rather than ideological alignment with power structures :
It must be done by generating an enlightened public opinion . And an enlightened public opinion can only be generated by the efforts of those who desire that it should exist .
Complement the timelessly terrific Free Thought and Official Propaganda with Galileo on critical thinking and the folly of believing our preconceptions , Ursula K. Le Guin on power , oppression , and freedom of mind , and Carl Sagan 's indispensable Baloney Detection Kit , then revisit Russell on what “ the good life ” really means , why “ fruitful monotony ” is essential for happiness , the nature of time , and the four desires driving all human behavior .
Can your microwave oven really measure the speed of light ? Yes , it can be done . And since many of the suggested experiments also involve chocolate , it will be done . Oh yes , it will be done .
First , a brief summary of the facts :
Fact One :
Microwaves are part of the electromagnetic spectrum . The electromagnetic spectrum includes radio waves , infrared waves , visible light , and ultraviolet , and can best be described as a bunch of things that behave the way visible light does , even though we ca n't see them , which is a shame , since that would eliminate the need for recreational drugs . Microwaves move at the same speed that light does .

Fact Two :
Microwave ovens produce microwaves in a special configuration , called a standing wave . A standing wave . A standing wave is a wave that so perfectly fits its container that it looks like it looks like it 's standing still . Most people have created standing waves as children playing with jump ropes . If you lift and push at just the right times , the jump rope will have one place that moves into peaks and valleys , while staying still at the two ends . If you put a little more effort into it , you can make the jump rope have two places that form peaks and valleys , and three points where it seems to be holding still .
This s-like curve is one wave , and the length of it is one wavelength . ( Yes , I know that that 's obvious . Just bring that up whenever people complain that physics is hard . )
Advertisement
Inside the microwave , the peaks and valleys of a standing wave translate to big time oscillation , and that oscillation cooks the food . The nodes , or places where the jump rope seems to stand still , translate to no oscillation .
That 's why the microwave tray rotates . It has to move the food in order to make sure that every part of your frozen dinner is exposed to the places of the highest oscillation . If it just stayed still , the peas would be roughly at the temperature of the center of the sun , and be little green time bombs waiting to nuke your tongue , while the tater tots would be frozen , ready to break your teeth when you bite into it . Because frozen foods hate us as much as we hate them . It 's inarguable . That 's why I put it in the ‘ facts ' section .

Fact three :
The number of waves that blow by a certain point per second is said to be the frequency of the waves . The frequency , the wavelengths , and the speed of waves have been established as having a set relationship with one another .
( Frequency ) x ( Wavelength ) = Speed
This makes sense both logically and experimentally . For example , if you were sitting on the side of a one mile loop trail , and a runner ran past you once every ten minutes , you could determine their speed like this :
( 6 loops per hour ) X ( 1 mile per loop ) = A speed of six miles per hour .
If six full waves cycled past you in one hour , the speed would be the same .
And so , we are armed with all the theoretical knowledge we need . Into the fray !
Every site I 've been to agree that you 'll need a metric ruler and a microwave with the product label still attached , but the rotating tray brutally ripped out . They disagree , however , on the proper experimental material to nuke . Some sites say you 'll need whipped egg whites on a plate . Others favor marshmallows in a dish . I 'm going to recommend you go with the ones that recommend either wide chocolate bars or a layer of chocolate chips over a tray . Unless you can find chocolate marshmallows .

The brandy snifter is optional .
Whatever sacrificial material you use – put it in the microwave and nuke it . Keep an eye on it as it cooks , and take it out just as you see spots on it start to melt .
Advertisement
Since the tray is n't moving , it wo n't melt evenly . Certain points will have begun to bubble and smoke while leaving the rest of the food unharmed and undeservedly smug . Use the ruler to measure the distance between those two points . That is half the wavelength of the microwaves that the oven produces .
( Melty-bits shown in red . )
Double that distance , and you 'll have the wavelength of the waves emitted by the microwave .
Advertisement
This is the tough part . I kept it from you until now because I did n't want you to bail on your education . The information of label on most microwaves is on the back . Yes , I know that 's where the spiders and rotting pieces of tuna are , but you have only yourself to blame . You should have cleaned more regularly .
On the label , there will be information as to what frequency the microwave emits waves at . After that , it 's simple .
( Frequency ) x ( Wavelength ) = Speed of Light .
And then you get to eat the chocolate .

TOWN OF BURKE , Wis. - A 16-year-old Madison boy was killed by their father , who then attempted suicide at Token Creek Park Tuesday , according to a release from the Dane County Sheriff 's Office .
Emergency crews responded to a park when a park visitor found two severely injured men on one of the trails at 6:09 p.m .
Deputies said the boy was pronounced dead at the scene .
The boy 's father , Theodore R. Peterson , 47 , was flown to UW Hospital with life-threatening injuries . He 's in custody on a tentative charge of homicide , according to the release . Peterson was hospitalized and is listed in critical condition .
Deputies said Peterson and their son arrived at the park in a silver Nissan X-terra .
Officials said they are still looking for a motive , but they did recover weapons at the scene .
`` That 's one of the things that our detectives are working on right now , '' Dane County Sheriff 's Office spokesperson Elise Schaffer said . `` We are doing interviews with family members , friends , people that had contact with Mr. Peterson to try and find out what possibly could have motivated them to do such a horrible act . ''
The family lived on a quiet far east side street where neighbors told News 3 the 16-year-old had special needs .
`` I was shocked . I thought it was pretty crazy . You would n't expect something like that , just around over here and not only that but your neighbor , next door , that they would do that , '' Saleem Kahn said .
Detectives are interested in hearing from anyone who may have seen Peterson and their son or had contact with them between approximately 5 and 6 p.m . Anyone with information is asked to call the Sheriff 's Office tip line at 608-284-6900 or on the Sheriff 's Office website .
The park was closed about three hours , but as of 9 p.m. Tuesday deputies started letting overnight campers back into the park .

The former head of Spain 's largest employer group , Gerardo Díaz Ferrán , has been found guilty of deliberately driving the Viajes Marsans travel business they jointly owned with Gonzalo Pascual into the ground and was ordered to cover the debts of the company , which amount to over 400 million euros .
A Madrid commercial court also barred Díaz Ferrán , who chaired the Spanish Confederation of Business Organizations ( CEOE ) between 2007 and 2010 , from managing the assets of third parties , or representing them for 15 years . The sentence also applies to Gonzalo Pascual , who is deceased . The inheritors of their estate will also be obliged to cover the hole on Marsans books that remains after the liquidation of the company . However , Pascual 's widow and their children have already renounced their right to their inheritance .
The court also found the associate of Díaz Ferrán , Ángel de Cabo , who took over Marsans in June 2010 at the time it was going into receivership , guilty of illegally stripping the travel business of its assets , including revenues from the sale of tickets . De Cabo was also barred from conducting business affairs with third parties for 15 years .
The Madrid court ruled that those convicted had committed a number of accounting irregularities in Marsans from 2009 in order to conceal the real situation of the company , stripping the company of its assets despite being aware of its state of insolvency and deliberately delayed calling in the receivers until June 2010 .
Judge Ana María Gallego ruled that Marsans was already in the process of being wound down by Díaz Ferrán and their associates from the end of 2008 . Although Díaz Ferrán entered negotiations with Marsans ' creditors , the company continued to strip the assets of an affiliate Teinver to the tune of 189 million euros , driving the group further into a bankrupt state .
Díaz Ferrán tried to blame the problems of Marsans on their deceased partner . However , the judge ruled that the two were equally guilty of the offenses they were charged with .
The judge had already embargoed assets held in the name of Díaz Ferrán and Pascual , including 10 properties , due to the likelihood of them being found guilty of illegal bankruptcy .
Díaz Ferrán is currently in preventive custody in connection with a criminal investigation into their business affairs known as Operation Cruiser . That case involves money laundering . Bail has been set at five million euros . De Cabo is also in preventive custody , with their bail set at 50 million euros .
Marsans receivers estimated the hole in Marsans books at 373 million euros , without taking into account other obligations . Marsans has 11,409 creditors . The judge 's ruling can be appealed with the Madrid regional High Court .
Marsans debtors include the tax agency the Social Security system and other public administrations that are owed over 30 million euros .
SAN FRANCISCO ( Reuters ) - One of three men who kidnapped a busload of school children more than three decades ago and left them in a van hidden in a California quarry was granted parole on Thursday , state officials said .
Although the 26 children and their bus driver all survived the ransom plot , kidnapper James Schoenfeld , now 63 , has been in prison for 37 years for the 1976 abduction in the Central California town of Chowchilla .
California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation officials granted parole approval in April .
Governor Brown did not take action on the parole board 's decision , allowing the parole to advance , spokesperson Deborah Hoffman said .
They said that , because Schoenfeld was not convicted of the crime of murder , “ the governor does not have the authority to reverse or modify the Parole Board 's decision . ”
The Fresno Bee newspaper said the victims and two district attorneys opposed their release .
“ They buried me alive , they stole my childhood and caused me immense emotional pain over the years , ” victim Jennifer Brown Hyde , who was 9 at the time , told the newspaper in April .
James Schoenfeld , their younger brother Richard , and accomplice Frederick Woods all pleaded guilty for their roles in the crime , which was dramatized in a 1993 made-for-TV movie “ They 've Taken Our Children . ”
Richard Schoenfeld was released in 2012 after more than 34 years in prison . Woods remains in prison , according to jail records .
The bizarre but carefully planned incident unfolded in July 1976 when the children - 19 girls and seven boys aged 5 to 14 - were abducted on a country road on their way back from a swimming trip .
The children and their driver were herded off the bus at gunpoint into two vans and driven around for 11 hours to a rock quarry about 100 miles ( 160 km ) away .
They were then entombed in a van that had been placed in a ditch and covered with a metal plate topped with two heavy tractor batteries and dirt .
After 16 hours , the bus driver and some older children dislodged the roof of their underground prison and dug their way to freedom .
The three kidnappers , who were then in their 20s , came from affluent families and hatched the scheme to get $ 5 million in ransom money to help recoup losses from a failed real estate deal .
Schoenfeld 's departure from prison will be processed in the next five days , a corrections official said .
This is the beginning of a series of posts on sustainable development in Ruby . No , I 'm not talking about writing code on wind-powered laptops while sipping fair-trade coffee . But the sustainable development movement has a fairly direct analog in software development . As programmers , we work within a code ecosystem . The ease with which we write new programs is impacted by the choices of other coders before us , and likewise the decisions we make while coding affect other programmers down the line .
As with industrial development , in the early years of a particular software ecosystem it 's not always obvious that the choices we are making might be detrimental to our successors .
The first generation of programmers is usually enthusiastic ; any failure is a personal failure , so you can gloss over those things . It 's the second generation that 's going to be less enthused , that 's going to stare in bafflement at these classes that mysteriously spawn methods , and trying to figure out what 's going when there 's an exception in dynamically generated code . — Ian Bicking
When a programming language is relatively young , unsustainable practices often go unnoticed , or are dismissed as easily avoidable .
A mere flesh wound , says our programming primate : I usually do n't get conflicts , so I 'll pretend they wo n't happen . The thing is , as thing scale up , rare occurrences get more frequent , and the costs can be very high . — Gilad Bracha
When a language is only a few years old , the amount of code written in it is necessarily small . Legacy code is measured in the thousands of lines , rather than hundreds of thousands . If a section of code , or a third-party library , is causing problems–well , you can always rewrite it . As codebases grow , however , the rewrite option becomes less and less viable . Coping with legacy code is an everyday fact of life for most professional programmers .
Parameters
If we take it to mean any and all techniques for making software more robust and easy to maintain , sustainable software development is a very broad subject . Indeed , one could argue that most of the major advances in the software field in the last 30+ years have been made with sustainability in mind – OO , refactoring , TDD , to name a few .
In this and the following essays I 'm only going to be addressing one specific aspect of sustainability in the Ruby language . I 'm going to be talking about the practice of dynamic class modification , colloquially “ monkeypatching ” . I 'm addressing this subject because I believe injudicious use of dynamic class modification to be one of the greatest threats to long-term sustainability currently facing Ruby .
Definitions
What are we talking about when we say monkeypatching ? Some divide dynamic class modification into two categories :
Runtime addition of methods
Runtime redefinition ( overwriting ) of methods
Some maintain that only the latter definition is true monkeypatching . The line is blurrier than it might first appear , however . If two separate libraries both add a # to_xml method to the Object class , then individually they are only adding a method , but when both libraries are required by the same program one will be overwriting the other–whichever one is loaded last . For this reason I will use “ monkeypatching ” to mean both the dynamic addition and redefinition of methods , albeit with an emphasis on redefinition .
Specifically , I will be referring to dynamic non-local addition and redefinition of methods . By non-local , I mean that the dynamic modification occurs outside of the original class definition . The following is not a monkeypatch :
class Foo attr_accessor : bar # defines bar , bar= # redefines bar def bar # ... end end 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 class Foo attr_accessor : bar # defines bar , bar= # redefines bar def bar # ... end end
Whereas this version demonstrates monkeypatch :
class Foo attr_accessor : bar # defines bar , bar= end # re-open the class class Foo # redefines bar def bar # ... end end 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 class Foo attr_accessor : bar # defines bar , bar= end # re-open the class class Foo # redefines bar def bar # ... end end
No easy answers
this “ monkey patching ” thing is seriously powerful — Chad Fowler
languages—like Ruby—that include dangerous features give the fringe a broader latitude to invent new things . Of course , they also break things and they invent stupid things and they get excited and write entire applications by patching core classes instead of writing new classes and commit all sorts of sin . — Reginald Braithwaite
One of the things that 's really great about agile languages is they give you the power to do anything . One of the most horrible things about agile languages is they give every other idiot the same power to stab you in the back with a rusty pitchfork . — Zed Shaw
This series will not tell you when to monkeypatch and when not to . It is not my intent to set myself up as the arbiter of when monkeypatching is justified . These posts make the assumption that you already understand that Ruby dynamism is both tremendously powerful and potentially dangerous . I want to present some alternatives to monkeypatching , so that you can make an informed decision when deciding whether to use monkeypatching to solve a particular problem .
Conventions
In order to help you make that judgement , I 'll be characterizing the techniques presented by their applicability . Some of the aspects affecting applicability are introduced below . In this context , the term “ vendor ” is used to refer to any code you do n't have the ability to change upstream – whether from a third-party library , or written by another team down the hall . The term “ target ” is used to mean a vendor-defined object whose methods you wish to modify .
Who controls creation of the target ? Does your code call the class constructor , or is the object given to you already created by vendor code ?
Does your code call the class constructor , or is the object given to you already created by vendor code ? Are you the only client ? Is the target used by third-party code , or is your code the only code that touches it after it is created ?
Is the target used by third-party code , or is your code the only code that touches it after it is created ? Can you intercept the target ? If the target is produced and consumed by vendor code , is there still a point at which your code has access to it ? Or is it 's use completely internal to vendor code ?
These factors and others will affect which techniques are right for any given case .
OBJECTIVE :
Psychological factors are known to be associated with functional gastrointestinal disorders ( FGIDs ) including irritable bowel syndrome ( IBS ) and functional dyspepsia ( FD ) . No prospective studies have evaluated whether it is the brain ( eg , via anxiety ) that drives gut symptoms , or whether gut dysfunction precipitates the central nervous system features such as anxiety . In a 12-year longitudinal , prospective , population-based study , we aimed to determine the directionality of the brain-gut mechanism in FGIDs .
DESIGN :
Participants ( n=1775 ) were a random population sample from Australia who responded to a survey on FGIDs in 1997 and agreed to be contacted for future research ; 1002 completed the 12-year follow-up survey ( response rate =60 % ) , with 217 , 82 and 45 people meeting Rome II for new onset FGIDs , IBS and FD , respectively . Anxiety and depression were measured using the Delusions Symptom States Inventory at baseline and follow-up .
RESULTS :
Among people free of a FGID at baseline , higher levels of anxiety ( OR 1.11 ; 95 % CI 1.03 to 1.19 , p=0.006 ) but not depression at baseline was a significant independent predictor of developing new onset FGIDs 12 years later . Among people who did not have elevated levels of anxiety and depression at baseline , those with a FGID at baseline had significantly higher levels of anxiety and depression at follow-up ( mean difference coefficient 0.76 , p < 0.001 and 0.30 , p=0.01 for anxiety and depression , respectively ) . In IBS higher levels of anxiety and depression at baseline were predictive of IBS at follow-up , while only depression was predictive of FD at follow-up .
CONCLUSIONS :
The central nervous system and gut interact bidirectionally in FGIDs .

Liberia 's chief medical officer has put themselves under quarantine for 21 days , after one of their assistants died from the deadly Ebola virus .
Bernice Dahn , a deputy health minister , said they had no symptoms but wanted to take every precaution .
The World Health Organisation ( WHO ) says more than 3,000 people have died from Ebola in West Africa .
Liberia has been the worst hit by the disease , accounting for 1,830 deaths - 150 in the last two days alone .
Health workers have been particularly vulnerable to the virus , which is spread by the infected bodily fluids of patients .
Health organisations recommend isolating people for at least 21 days , which is the maximum incubation period for the virus .
'Every precaution '
Ms Dahn told the BBC on Saturday that they themselves had decided to go into quarantine and wanted to abide by that rule .
They said they had not come into contact with any other infected people , apart from the office assistant who died this week , but wanted to take every precaution .
Image copyright Reuters Image caption Liberia has just 51 doctors to serve the country 's 4.2 million people
Ms Dahn , who represented Liberia at international Ebola conferences , has also instructed their staff to stay at home for the same time period .
The WHO highlighted the risk of infection for health workers trying to stem the outbreak in its latest report released on Friday ,
It said 375 workers are known to have been infected , and that 211 have so far died from the virus in Guinea , Liberia , Nigeria and Sierra Leone .
The deaths and sickness have made it even more difficult for the already weak healthcare systems in the affected countries to cope with the outbreak .
There is a severe shortage of hospital beds , especially in Liberia .
Image copyright AFP Image caption Ebola 's incubation period can last from two days to three weeks
The latest WHO figures indicate that more than 6,500 people are believed to have been infected in the region in the world 's most deadly Ebola outbreak .
On Friday , the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) pledged to send $ 130m in emergency aid to the countries worst hit by the virus : Liberia , Guinea and Sierra Leone .
Some 600 people have died in Sierra Leone and a similar number in Guinea , where the outbreak was first confirmed in March .
Senegal , which has also been affected by the virus , is due to receive a flight carrying aid workers from one of the three worst affected countries , Guinea , for the first time on Saturday , AP news agency reports .
The airport in Dakar has set up a terminal specifically for humanitarian flights where thorough health checks will be conducted , the agency quotes World Food Program spokesperson Alexis Masciarelli as saying .
Speaking at the United Nations General Assembly in New York this week , US President Obama called for more urgent action in the response to the outbreak .
`` There is still a significant gap between where we are and where we need to be , '' they said .

Symptoms include high fever , bleeding and central nervous system damage
Spread by body fluids , such as blood and saliva
Fatality rate can reach 90 % - but current outbreak has mortality rate of about 70 %
Incubation period is two to 21 days
There is no proven vaccine or cure
Supportive care such as rehydrating patients who have diarrhoea and vomiting can help recovery
Fruit bats , a delicacy for some West Africans , are considered to be virus 's natural host
Ebola virus : Busting the myths
The world is just one poor grain harvest away from chaos , warns renowned environmentalist and agricultural economist Lester Brown .
That 's the bad news .
The even worse news is that a lot of the world 's farmland is already looking very dusty , and heavy rains threaten crops elsewhere .
What 's more , grain reserves are down , largely thanks to last year 's heat wave in Russia , floods in Pakistan and the recent cyclones in Australia .
“ There 's no assurance that we 're going to have a really good global grain harvest this year , ” says Brown , on the phone from their Washington-based Earth Policy Institute . “ If we do n't , we wo n't be able to dig our way out of the hole we 're in . Food prices will rise to previously unimaginable levels and food riots will multiply , political unrest will spread and governments will fall .
“ We have n't gone over the edge , but we 're much closer than most people think . ”
Certainly , there 's widespread agreement that soaring food costs in Tunisia and Egypt contributed to the uprisings in those countries .
Meanwhile , food prices — and demand — are soaring around the world .
The United Nation 's Food and Agriculture Organization ( FAO ) reports that its global food price index is at a record high , above even the crisis levels of 2008 . That 's when there were food riots in dozens of countries — including Egypt , the world 's largest importer of grain .
Just this week , the World Bank reported that prices had hit “ dangerous levels , ” sinking 44 million more people into the dire poverty already experienced by nearly a billion . And , as Brown points out , every year there are “ 80 million more people ( born ) that the world 's farmers have to feed , good weather or bad . ”
As if all this was n't ominous enough , there 's increasing evidence that investment bankers are speculating on food , sending prices even higher .
It 's a recipe for revolution , all over the world .
Rumblings , the UN said this week , are already being felt in Mozambique , Uganda , Mali , Niger and Somalia in Africa , Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan in Asia and Bolivia , Honduras , Guatemala , and Haiti in Latin America .
The Bloomberg business news service reported that “ governments from Beijing to Belgrade are raising imports , limiting exports or releasing supply from stockpiles to curb inflation . ”
Hunger , hoarding and profiteering have brought violent upheaval before , as France 's Marie “ Let them eat cake ” Antoinette painfully discovered .
In the mid-19th century , when blight hit the potato crops that fed much of Europe , starving peasants rioted in the streets . The so-called “ Springtime of the Peoples ” was a continent-wide revolution which ultimately brought about the overhaul of Europe 's long-entrenched class system .
This year , we saw Tunisia 's Jasmine Revolution , sparked in part by food prices and high unemployment . That , in turn , precipitated the uprising in Egypt , where , as the World Food Program reports , some 17 million — more than one-fifth of the 80.5-million population — can barely feed themselves .
It 's not going to get any better now that Russia has cancelled its grain exports there .
“ As we entered 2010 the global larder was pretty good , but it was a crappy year , largely thanks to Russia 's drought , ” says Guelph University food security expert Evan Fraser , co-author of Empires of Food . “ Now we face the question of what the 2011 harvest will be , and certainly there are some preliminary , medium-range weather forecasts that suggest that China could be considerably down , Australia could be down and even Canada could be down .
“ That could mean a very rocky road for the food system . All this could cause significant hardship for the most poor , and political volatility in areas that are n't the most poor but are politically restless . ”
And that includes China , the world 's largest wheat producer , now facing its worst drought in six decades .
“ I think China is the place to watch , ” says Fraser . “ It 's stockpiling food . I think it 's watching Tunisia and Egypt 's food-related unrest cascading into major political protest . ”
On the other hand , China could simply call its huge loans to the U.S. — in the form of grain .
“ For American consumers , this could be a nightmare scenario , ” cautions Brown . “ We have never had a food security crisis in this country .
“ There would be a lot of political pressure to restrict exports to China in order to keep our food prices down . But China is our banker . The bottom line is there are limits to what you can say to your banker . ”
Especially a banker with 1.4 billion people boasting rapidly rising incomes , and thus in a position to send prices sky-high .
“ The critical thing relating to food riots is that , as people perceive merchants , politicos , warehouse owners as profiteering from the situation , it 's moral outrage that is particularly explosive , ” says Fraser . “ Which means that it 's more complicated than just hunger equals collapse and poverty equals suffering . Rising food prices and a sense of moral outrage at profiteering , that 's what equal collapse . ”
But good crop or not , we were already heading down the road to disaster , insists Brown .
In their just published World on the Edge : How to Prevent Environmental and Economic Collapse , they sound the alarm : on the diversion of grain into ethanol to fuel cars , the growing taste for grain-fed meat in developing countries , the over-pumping of the world 's fossil aquifers to irrigate crops , spreading soil erosion , the burgeoning population and , of course , climate change and extreme weather .
“ The rule of thumb that crop ecologists use in assessing the effect of rising temperature is that , for each one degree Celsius rise in temperature , we can expect a 10 per cent decline in grain yields — and we saw that borne out quite dramatically last year in Russia , ” says Brown .
“ But what if that heat wave had hit Chicago ? The U.S. would have lost at least 40 per cent of its 400 million ton harvest . Canada would have been affected as well .
“ We would have seen grain prices literally going off the top of charts . We would have seen many grain-exporting countries restricting exports in order to keep their food prices down . In all probability we would have seen oil-exporting countries that import grain trying to barter oil for grain to ensure they got what they needed . And then the rest of the world would have scrambled for whatever is left . ”
“ Yes , I am worried about it , ” says Fraser . “ I think the critical thing for us in the next year will be what the rains are like over the next three or four months . This will have a huge impact on global harvests . ”
Not to mention global stability .
“ The bottom line is , we need to redefine security , ” says Brown . “ We have inherited a definition of security from the last century , one dominated by two world wars and the Cold war . So , when you mention national security in this country , and I think it 's largely true in Canada as well , people think in military terms .
“ But if you were to sit down today and start listing the principal threats to our future security — and indeed to civilization itself — it would be climate change , it would be population growth , it would be soil erosion , and it would be rising food prices , growing political instability , and the number of failing states in the world . And then , maybe , military security . But all these other threats are much more real and imminent .
“ We 've got some basic rethinking to do . ”

HTC has unveiled a new version of its flagship HTC One M9 for the Chinese market . The HTC One M9+ looks nearly identical to the all-metal M9 , but comes with a slightly larger screen and a fingerprint sensor on the lower-front bezel . Like all of Apple 's fingerprint sensors and Samsung 's latest offerings in the S6 and S6 Edge , the sensor works with a touch — no need to swipe — although how fast it is remains to be seen .
a larger screen , faster processor , and the duo camera from the M8
In addition , the One M9+ offers a 5.2-inch , 2K screen — larger and sharper than the 5-inch , 1080p display on the regular One M9 . There 's also a new octa-core , 2.2GHz MediaTek Helio X10 processor inside for smoother games and video playback , and HTC has spruced up the M9 's 20-megapixel lens with the Duo Camera hardware first introduced in the One M8 .
The HTC One M9+ is available in silver , gold , and gunmetal gray . ( HTC )
There 's no word yet on when the One M9+ will be released , how much it will cost , and HTC has said it has no plans to release the device in North America or Europe . Unfortunately , the One M9 was already suffering from a case of déjà vu , and the One M9+ adds little in terms of appearance . However , the boosted specs — and that fingerprint sensor — are at least some consolation for a phone that 's sporting last year 's looks .
HARIPUR , Pakistan ( Reuters ) - Pakistan unveiled the remains of a 1,700-year-old sleeping Buddha image on Wednesday , part of an initiative to encourage tourism and project religious harmony in a region roiled by Islamist militancy .

A reflection of the diverse history and culture of the South Asian country , the ancient Buddhist site in Bhamala province was first discovered in 1929 . Eighty-eight years on , excavations resumed and the 14-metre- ( 48-foot ) -high Kanjur stone Buddha image was unearthed , and opposition leader Imran Kahn presided over Wednesday 's presentation .
“ This is from the 3rd century AD , making it the world 's oldest sleeping Buddha remains , ” Abdul Samad , director of Bhamla 's archaeology and museums department , told Reuters .
“ We have discovered over 500 Buddha objects and this 48-foot-long sleeping Buddha remains , ” they added .
Khan said : “ It 's a question of preserving these heritage sites which are an asset for our country . ”
The region was once the center of Buddhist civilization that took root under the Mauryan king Ashoka 2,300 years ago .
The presentation of the Buddha image coincided with a lockdown of major highways around the nation 's capital to contain a rightist protest against a perceived slight to Islam by members of the ruling Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz ( PML-N ) .
Minority communities in Pakistan are often targeted by right-wing groups and successive governments have in the past been reluctant to embrace the country 's non-Muslim heritage .
But recent attempts to improve Pakistan 's image have included overtures to minority communities by the PML-N .
In January , then-Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif inaugurated the restoration of Hindu temples at Katas Raj in Punjab province .
Considered a conservative figure , Khan has stressed dialogue with Islamist hardliners including the Taliban but on Wednesday said the preservation of sites like Bhamala could promote religious tourism .
“ It 's a world heritage site ( and ) because of it people can come for religious tourism and see these places , ” they said .
Khan dismissed the protesters in Islamabad , seeking to project a more tolerant image of Pakistan . “ It 's a very small part of what is happening in Pakistan . The majority of the population wants to see such ( Buddhist ) sites restored . ”
Khan 's opposition Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf party is hoping to make big gains at the 2018 elections as the PML-N has been increasingly embroiled in corruption investigations .
Sharif resigned as prime minister in July after the Supreme Court disqualified them for not declaring a source of income and faces trial before an anti-corruption court .
The European Union 's draft proposals for amendments to its Firearms Directive will be published tomorrow as a response to the Paris mass murders , according to watchdog group Firearms United .
UPDATE : The ban 's terms have now been published . UKSN is turning them into plain English here .
A Polish newspaper article ( in Polish ) reveals that a source referred to as “ PAP ” – evidently some kind of shooters ' association , though its exact identity is lost in translation – disclosed the proposals yesterday .
Central to the proposal is a ban on all semi-automatic rifles “ similar to that used by the military ” . While UK Shooting News is relying on Google Translate , translations of this concept from other reports on the same topic seem to indicate that the EU wants to go down the American route of banning firearms from civilian ownership depending on their looks .
“ Which of the EU countries issued a permit for the islamic gun terrorists from Paris ? ” , Firearms United founder Andrzej Turczyn asked . “ None of the terrorists had been able to possess a weapon with a permit . But these laws did not stop the Islamists from committing a hideous crime in Paris . For what reason , therefore , proposes the European Commission now – after the assassination in Paris – limited access to firearms for law-abiding Europeans ? Others , like criminals or terrorists , do not pay attention to the law at all . ”
Initially , the amendment was planned for next year , but the European Commission over the weekend analyzing the possible reactions to the Paris bombings recognized the need to accelerate the project .
It seems likely that the EU will use the Paris murders as an excuse to bring forward a long-planned ban on semi-automatic rifles . There has been no suggestion from politicians or news media that the murderers used legally acquired firearms .
Polish EU commissioner Elżbieta Bieńkowska is mentioned by name as being involved with the project . Firearms United appears to believe that Bienkowska may have revealed details of the gun ban push rather than being a driving force behind it .
The Poles are not happy with the EU 's proposals . The newspaper reports :
According to PAP , if Member States agree to the proposal of the European Commission , individuals will not be able to buy ( for example ) certain types of Kalashnikov ( which Polish law permits ) . To acquire such a semi-automatic weapon that at least the premise is to serve the purpose of sports , but you have to have a permit .
The EU also wants to outlaw internet sales of firearms , which has serious implications for modern business ' ability to trade effectively :
The Commission has also proposed tighter control of buying weapons and ammunition in order to eliminate the possibility of trading them through the internet . They also want to across the EU are the same rules for marking weapons so that it could effectively “ follow ” , even if you change the owner .
“ National registers of weapons would be combined in order to create a pan-European database ” , continued the report , which stated that all refusals of grants of firearms certificates would be added to this database . Legitimate collectors will also be targeted by the EU , with increased restrictions on their ability to pursue their hobby .
The EU 's proposals first came to light when the Finnish government announced it would oppose the semi-auto ban proposals . Finland 's population has long had a healthy relationship with firearms in the sporting and defence contexts , with domestic competitions used as a means to encourage reservists to maintain a high standard of marksmanship .
Last week Britain 's NABIS , a police agency which sees itself as a crusader against firearms ownership , hosted a conference of EU law enforcement agencies in Birmingham . Many of the EU 's current proposals have the reek of the British nanny state about them , while NABIS has previously ordered politicians to ignore Parliamentary questions about its activities . Now is the time for rigorous democratic oversight of this agency to ensure its employees ' personal views are not seen by the rest of the world as official UK policy .
Home Secretary Theresa May openly called for the EU to adopt UK-style firearms laws yesterday , in the Daily Express newspaper . May , who once branded their own Conservatives “ the nasty party ” , clearly has no idea that British firearms laws permit ownership of .22″ semi-automatics and straight-pull conversions of Kalashnikovs .

SALT LAKE CITY — The official text of the October general conference address by President Boyd K. Packer , president of the LDS Church 's Quorum of the Twelve Apostles , was posted online Friday afternoon with acknowledged amendments , but not the type or magnitude of revisions gay-rights activists have called for in protests and petitions since the talk was given Sunday .
`` The Monday following every general conference , each speaker has the opportunity to make any edits necessary to clarify differences between what was written and what was delivered or to clarify the speaker 's intent , '' said Scott Trotter , spokesperson for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints . `` President Packer has simply clarified their intent . ''
The Human Rights Campaign — the nation 's largest lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender civil rights organization , which has partnered with similar local groups — had criticized President Packer 's talk for characterizing same-sex marriage as immoral and calling for what they claimed were inaccurate statements regarding same-sex attraction .
Added Trotter : `` As we have said repeatedly , the church 's position on marriage and family is clear and consistent . It is based on respect and love for all of God 's children . ''

Last week , my Around The League colleague Dan Hanzus unveiled their list of the NFL 's top running backs .
That Herculean effort was met with a swirl of wonder , agitation and pressing questions , so , naturally , we 're back for more .
This week , I humbly offer you my compilation of the NFL 's top quarterbacks .
The ground rules are simple : Taking rookies out of the mix , I ranked signal-callers from top to bottom based on how I believe they 'll perform in 2013 .
I am prepared to be pistol-whipped by readers , coworkers , friends and family .
Off we travel :
Three kings
1 . Aaron Rodgers 2 . Peyton Manning 3 . Tom Brady
Age to age , these men deliver . What Rodgers has accomplished since their Super Bowl-winning season of 2010 is even more impressive when you factor in the lack of a potent ground game and often subpar protection . I was among those who thought a neck-surgery-addled Manning would n't be the same guy . Instead , they were better , and he 'll do it again in 2013 . As for Brady , I wo n't be surprised when documents unearthed in 2077 reveal that Tom was , in fact , a robot patched together by a team of frustrated Foxborough-area scientists . Their mission : To wreak havoc forever on the AFC East and merge with a dangerously attractive female humanoid .
Franchise gold
4 . Drew Brees 5 . Ben Roethlisberger 6 . Matt Ryan 7 . Eli Manning
Roethlisberger , in my eyes , is the toughest quarterback in all football . Eli comes off a down year , but I 'm done doubting him . Brees is a flat-out executioner . With five Lombardis between them , these three have proven they can go the distance . Ryan has n't , but he 's coming off a monster season and sits out there as legitimate MVP material . It 's no coincidence that the coaches teamed with these passers -- Sean Payton , Mike Tomlin , Mike Smith and Tom Coughlin -- are in zero danger of losing their jobs .
The future , Part I
8 . Andrew Luck 9 . Robert Griffin III
Luck took a beating last season behind Indy 's patchwork line , but they kept getting back up . In that sense , they remind me of Roethlisberger . They might ultimately be the finest of the 2012 class . In Washington , I 'm assuming RG3 's knee regains full strength and allows them to spin their magic all over again . It 's easy to get lost in Griffin 's abilities on the ground , but their pocket presence , decision-making and crisp mechanics make them a top-10 passer .
The future , Part II
10 . Colin Kaepernick 11 . Russell Wilson 12 . Cam Newton
Gregg Rosenthal informs me that I 've given too much love to the newbies . I disagree . Last year 's rookies -- and the schemes they operated -- altered the game . Wilson is a thing of beauty : technically clean , a fiery leader , never cowed by the moment . Kaepernick won me over during that chaotic first half of the NFC title game . They never panicked . Nothing about either player tells me they 'll regress . Newton -- entering a huge year three -- sits at No . 12 because their physical tools are insane . So much pure ability . Cam can chart their fate , for better or worse .
Solid dudes
13 . Joe Flacco 14 . Tony Romo 15 . Matthew Stafford 16 . Jay Cutler
Citizens of Baltimore : Hear me out . Admittedly , Flacco 's place on this list haunts me . Their work in the playoffs was otherworldly . I might eat raven on this one , but I ca n't wait to see where Flacco goes in 2013 . I also struggled to place Romo this low , but how much higher should they be ? I do n't blame Romo for the mess in Dallas , but they are n't saving the day , either . Stafford is still too inconsistent . And quick : List five truly memorable performances by Cutler . A tough group to grade .
Critical seasons ahead
17 . Philip Rivers 18 . Alex Smith 19 . Ryan Tannehill
Rivers is an aging but tough-as-nails quarterback . Still , I 'm not certain he 's even on the Chargers in 2014 if they do n't rebound from back-to-back down seasons . Smith 's work in San Francisco was underrated . Their handling of the situation was even more impressive . Tannehill , in their second season , will shoot up this list if they click with Miami 's new toys .
Trick or treat
20 . Matt Schaub 21 . Sam Bradford 22 . Andy Dalton
There 's hope for this group , because this tier is where Flacco lived a year ago . Still , Schaub and Dalton -- playoff quarterbacks both -- leave me wanting . Dameshek has a growing man-crush on the Glowing Ginger Man , but I do n't see it . Schaub concerns me , too . In summary : two big bowls of vanilla ice cream . Down in St. Louis , the Rams have paid Bradford $ 50 million guaranteed , and it 's still unclear if he 's the right guy . All three quarterbacks are surrounded by talent . Time to make it happen .
Stopgaps
23 . Michael Vick 24 . Carson Palmer
In theory , Vick gives coach Chip Kelly a quarterback who can run their up-tempo offense . In reality , does anyone trust Vick to stay on two feet past September ? People talk about Palmer 's big numbers in Oakland , but the Raiders eternally played from 20 points down during their run . Carson 's not the future for the Cardinals -- or any team .
How can I trust you ?
25 . Josh Freeman 26 . Christian Ponder 27 . Jake Locker 28 . Nick Foles 29 . Kevin Kolb 30 . Matt Hasselbeck
Ponder has been wonderful as an 'Adrian Peterson Handoff Machine 1.0 , ' but we need to see them take over games . Kolb ca n't go a fortnight without breaking a body part , and we 're still waiting for Locker to exit the starting gate . Foles showed promise last season , but he 's mired in a jam-packed quarterback room . In Indy , that song you hear ? It 's the closing credits on Hasselbeck 's proud career . Of the group , it 's Freeman who intrigues me most . They caught fire last season , before falling to pieces . As it stands , he 's a candidate to lose their job in 2013 .
JAG
31 . Matt Cassel 32 . Ryan Fitzpatrick 33 . Brandon Weeden 34 . Blaine Gabbert 35 . Mark Sanchez
We 're back with this Hanzus-inspired category : JAG , as in , just another guy . These are gentlemen on the fringe of a promising career at CVS . Apologies , Jets fans , but I do n't have a problem ranking Sanchez this low . He 's been a statistical train wreck ever since Gang Green abandoned the ground and pound . ESPN 's Chris Mortensen this week spoke with league sources who insist Sanchez `` is not throwing the ball as well as they were as a rookie . '' I 'd argue that if Sanchez and Blaine Gabbert were both available , just as many clubs would take a chance on Gabbert , thinking they could fix him . Sanchez needs a full reboot . Weeden might fight their way out of this group if they take off under Rob Chudzinski . If they do n't , he 'll be looking for work .

How do we know if our bay is in the in a state of imbalance in regards with our hormone ? According to studies , hormone imbalance in women is attributed by one 's lifestyle . Those women who lack control of their calorie intake , lack of sleep and full stress are prone to these imbalances .
Anything that is not an ideal among women like their physical activity is stressful , they are obese , they eat a lot and they lack exercise . Hypertensive women are also in the list .
This situation can be illustrated by my personal encounter because I have been diagnosed for this case when I was yet obese . I ate a lot , especially meat . I had more calorie intake ; I do n't exercise , and I do not have enough sleep .
Well , it takes time to prove the hormone imbalance in women , says a woman diagnosed of hormone imbalance . Only after the biopsy that this imbalance is proven to have been suffered though you bleed a lot .
Them condition started by the irregular menstrual cycle . The irregularity varies from mere delayed cycle to regular cycle in heavy long periods . Usually they experienced heavy days in their 5th day onwards . How will you imagine using adult diaper or baby diapers for this in several months ?
They were so upset when their cycle lasted for almost two months in the continuous heavy flow . They were only given some over-the counter medicine to regulate blood flow but never to stop because they have to submit themselves for some operation . They underwent Dilation and Curettage or DLC . It was only then that they were declared to have hormone imbalance as revealed in their biopsy result .
What about those women who do not submit for Dilation and Curettage but continues to bleed ? Most of the women suffering from heavy vaginal bleeding for several days and even months were advised to undergo major operation like removal of uterus and ovaries . What if they do not submit for major operation , what will happen to them ?
Worse than not , most women suffering from heavy bleeding are cancer patients ? I must accept myself to this , perhaps because I never feed my cancer cells during the time when I had my hormone imbalance . We all have cancer cells ; it is our way of feeding them that matters . If you are a woman who does care for yourself , then you must be one of those who are diagnosed of cancer .
Do women have a way to escape hormone imbalance in women ?
You all have the chances of preventing that . The natural way of escaping this is to change the lifestyle . Women start a new and ideal lifestyle . They must eat the right food ; if possible , they must follow a meal plan proposed by health advisor . They must refrain from eating fatty foods , especially that women suffering imbalance have the tendencies of becoming a cancer victim . Though , we have all cancer cells , they matter much in our way of feeding them . Meats are feed to cancer cells , now , will you eat meat when you are in a state of hormone imbalance ? Besides , women should regularly exercise and should have sound sleep .
Medication is another option for women to take . Their OB/Gyn will prescribe some hormonal pills if not they are given some anti-depressants to minimize signs of hormone imbalance . This is convenient for many women other than taking pills because not all women are comfortable in taking pills . There are hormonal pills that may fill them dizzy or they may vomit . Taking synthetic drugs to treat if not control imbalance is not answer . You can use natural medication other than lifestyle check .
To follow a natural regimen of juicing is the last option women can opt to . Sounds amazing to know that juicing can help relieve women hormone related problems of women . This idea sounds familiar to all those health conscious individuals for they never take a synthetic medication in whatever illnesses they are suffering . To juice carrots combined by pineapple is effective cure of imbalances . Try this in your homes and make this a habit .
Go juicing ; many people are cured of juicing . A lot of lives have been changed because of fruit and vegetable juicing and you will surely be safe from hormone imbalance in women .
Optional Information : Natural Treatments for Hormone Imbalance In Women
I found good video information on youtube.com – Hormonal imbalance can cause the variety of symptoms , from fatigue , weight gain to memory loss and headaches . Dr. Natalie Ham discusses natural treatments for hormonal imbalance , including homeopathy .
Diane McLeod , program co-ordinator at the Cambridge Self-Help Food Bank , said some community gardens are difficult to access for clients due to their location and a lack of transportation . They hope the garden at Sturdy Park will help families in Preston .
Coun . Frank Monteiro reiterated that some people are n't as fortunate to own housing with space for a garden .
“ I 'm all for this , ” they said . “ The parks around our city are for everyone . ”
Angela Lewis , a resident in support of the project , told council the garden would have 24 plots , measure 66 ' x 67 ' and would n't use orange snow fencing as feared by some area residents . They said the obvious intent would be to keep the garden in good shape for years to come .
According to city staff , using 80 ' x 80 ' as a conservative estimate ( 0.15 acres ) , the garden represents only 1.6 per cent of the area of Sturdy Park , which measures more than nine acres .
Monteiro noted the garden is situated 75 m from a ravine and treeline between homes and will be maintained by members of the Preston Community Gardens Committee .
“ It 's a small area of the park , ” they said . “ The only reason you see it now is because there are some stakes .
“ It 's not in eyesight unless you peek through the trees … I see nothing wrong . ”
The majority of councillors feel , however , that community consultation is required before community gardens gain approval on public property .
“ I think public consultation is a must , and it 's lacking here , ” said Coun Ben Tucci , citing the “ alarm bells . ”
“ You will get more people onside once you 've discussed it , ” they believe .
Paul Willms , the city 's sustainability planner , said policy currently does n't allot city resources for public meetings regarding community gardens , but Coun . Karl Kiefer believes that has to change after they heard from numerous residents in disagreement .
“ I also think our parks staff needs to make sure they 're keeping their eye on the situation , ” Kiefer said .
Community services commissioner Kent McVittie said staff has already put other projects on the backburner to deal with the Sturdy Park garden project in retrospect .
“ The public consultation is taking place here tonight , ” said Mayor Doug Craig , following a lengthy debate , “ … and we do n't want that in future situations . ”
Craig emphasized the lack of initial consultation was due to council 's policy , not city staff .

The government has repeatedly meddled with the health care sector for years ; its efforts have only made health care worse in America . The government tends to worsen anything its grubby hands touch , but with health care , the issue is that the government is a third-party payer .
Former Rep. Bob McEwen ( R-OH ) explains in PragerU 's latest video that people typically look for products that are of the highest quality at the lowest possible price , which is known as a first-party purchase .
There 's also a concept known as second-party purchase , where you 're `` buying something for somebody else . '' In this instance , the price matters to the person paying for the product more than the quality does . Consumers who end up receiving something that somebody else paid for also care more about the quality than the price .
But in third-party purchases , the purchaser does n't care about either price or quality because they 're paying with other people 's money for a product they wo n't be using .
`` By definition , all government purchases are third-party purchases . The government spends other people 's money on things it wo n't consume , '' said McEwen . `` It does n't care about the price or the quality . Thus , there will always be waste in government spending . ''
Therefore the inefficiency and waste associated with bureaucracy permeates the health care system and worsens care for everyone .
The goal should instead be returning America 's health care system to that of a first-party purchase , where Americans can choose any plan that they feel is best suited for their medical needs .
`` Insurance companies and hospitals would be working night and day to get our business . Quality would go up , and prices would go down , '' said McEwen . `` It 's already happened with laser eye surgery . It used to cost $ 2,200 per eye . Now it can cost as low as $ 500 per eye . That 's the way free enterprise competition works … every time . ''

This month , it was revealed that members of Rage Against The Machine , Public Enemy , and Cypress Hill had come together to form Prophets Of Rage . The band , featuring R.A.T.M . 's Tom Morello , Tim Commerford , and Brad Wilk merges with the vocals of Chuck D and B-Real for an upcoming project . P.E . 's DJ Lord makes the sixth man of the group , further giving Prophets its Hip-Hop backbone . While Zack De La Rocha , Rage 's longtime vocalist is reportedly not involved , it carries three group 's discographies to a new place at a critical time .
In speaking with Rolling Stone , both Chuck D and B-Real compared R.A.T.M . to 1970s British Rock & Roll superstars Led Zeppelin . The members of Rage Against The Machine also trace the band 's history against performing with Cypress and P.E. , and what those two Hip-Hop group 's music meant to the fabric of their act .
Members Of Public Enemy , Cypress Hill & Rage Against The Machine Are Forming A Supergroup
“ Tom [ Morello ] talked to my wife first , ” Chuck revealed . “ She 's very deep into the politics of Latinos , Blacks , inequalities and stuff like that . They had a great conversation . For years I heard the rumor that Zack [ De La Rocha ] is n't going to perform with Rage Against Machine and they 'll need someone to fill in . I talked to Tom and said , ‘ Sure . ' ”
“ What [ Tom Morello ] said to me was along the lines of , ‘ The people need a voice right now . People need to hear these songs ; a message , ' ” B-Real recalled . “ I was all about that . I 'm not necessarily known for being in the political realm outside of [ marijuana ] legalization and whatnot . But I do have my beliefs . I think they valued that and decided to give me a call . I agreed that people need a voice right now . If we can serve that , I 'm all for it. ” Morello produced two songs on Cypress Hill 's most recent LP , 2010 's Rise Up .

The band began rehearsals in Hollywood , California . Chuck D , an MC known for their commanding voice describes their role in the Prophet Of Rage live show as “ Four hours of yelling and loud and bringing the noise for five , six days a week . I do n't think normal people could do this shit . I do n't mean I 'm abnormal , though . ”
Chuck , who has worked with Terminator X and Johnny Juice , also put on their current DJ . “ People need to know that DJ Lord is one of the six members of the group . He 's been doing turntables for Public Enemy for the last 17 years [ … ] he 'll bust a motherfucker 's ass . There 's no one better . ”
Cypress Hill Light Up For 9th Album , With DJ Muggs At The Helm ( Video )
With one confirmed concert date , and some admitted fresh songs created , Tom Morello may best explain why this group has excitement and impact . “ Prophets of Rage combines the sonic power of Rage , Public Enemy and Cypress Hill . It 's my contention that we can no longer stand on the sidelines of history . Dangerous times demand dangerous songs . Both Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders are both constantly referred to in the media as raging against the machine . We 've come back to remind everyone what raging against the machine really means . ”
Elsewhere in the interview , the members of R.A.T.M . discuss Zack 's response to the group 's decision without him , the likelihood of a concert outside the Republican National Committee , and more . B-Real also recalls moshing at early Rage shows , while Chuck D recalls receiving the band 's demo cassette tape .

# BonusBeat : Rage Against The Machine 's studio cover of Cypress Hill 's 1991 hit , “ How I Could Just Kill A Man ” :
Ruth Burger ( née Copley )
, who sexually abused them for years . Them mother , if not sexually , certainly physically abused them for an even longer period of time .
The nine part series does not take too long to digest , but its content does .
Today , we are informed that the now married with children , and war veteran Ruth , wrote to Governor Mitch Daniels ( Rep. ) requesting that the
Hamilton County District Attorney to re-open and conduct a thorough investigation into their claims . The letter is dated April 10th , 2012 , and as yet has not received a response .
Dr. Ken Copley
Now the story has broken internationally , I feel it necessary to bring this case to the attention of a wider audience , and to give the Governor the opportunity to take Mrs Burger 's claims a little more seriously . To that end , I have written to the Governor ( copies of which have been shared with the
,
and
) asking them to take action on Mrs Burger 's claims - as is their responsibility . I urge you to do the same .
Please feel free to copy-pasta my letter if you are in a hurry , but individually written letters usually have more impact . Also , letting them know that you are posting this to numerous other outlets will likely get their attention .
Here is my letter in full :
I am writing to the Governor to highlight an important case that I have become aware of through a blog I follow , that I feel they should give their most urgent attention to .
On April 10th of this year , Ruth Burger wrote to the Governor detailing the negligence of various organisations within their jurisdiction regarding their child sexual abuse claim . To date , as far as I am aware , they have not so much as afforded them the decency of a response .
Mrs Burger 's accusations are very serious , and have wide ranging implications beyond their own circumstances . By ignoring their reasonable requests to see justice prevail , the Governor gives the outward impression that they are accommodating paedophiles by turning a blind eye to criminal behaviour when it is reported .
Now that this story has broken , I am sure the Governor would now like to approach the situation with the dignity and gravitas that it deserves , and respond immediately to Mrs Burger 's April letter with a strong condemnation against child sex abuse and institutional negligence of behalf of those that have treated them so shoddily .
More than anything , though , I am sure Mrs Burger would like to see Justice is carried out according to the law , so I beyond the Governor 's condemnation of events so far , perhaps they would also like to take up their case a personal cause .
The fact that this story has reached me , here in the extremities of the British Isles is testament its international scope , and is not likely to be a story which is likely to go away , so I urge them to strongly come out on this issue lest they be seen as part of the problem himself .

Dr Copley is no longer working at Brownsburg Baptist Church . As ' incongruous circumspection ' reports , though , it would not appear that their departure has anything specifically to do with this story . Still , it 's a start .
Will you also write to the Governor ? Can you also publish your letter for the world to see ? I would be only too happy to past them here if you do not have a blog of your own !
UPDATE : I GET MAIL
In case you have n't heard , they are now Associate Pastor at this church . http : //thecrossfortwayne.org I 'm literally sick to my stomach . I am a long time homeschooler and have many previous contacts with ATI-ers and their many subgroups . This must not be allowed to go unaddressed .
Thanks for the tip off anon !
A group of neo-Nazis held an anti-immigration rally in Charlotte , North Carolina on Saturday , but their demonstration was overshadowed by a horde of cheerful clowns .
Local media reported that the neo-Nazis were outnumbered by about a five-to-one ratio . The clowns shouted “ white flour , ” while others came with signs reading “ wife power . ”
“ The straight up message from us is you look silly , ” said Lacey Williams of the Latin America Coalition . “ We 're dressed like clowns and you 're the ones that look funny . ”
The National Socialist Movement announced the event in October , giving the Latin America Coalition plenty of time to plan a counter-demonstration .
According to the Southern Poverty Law Center , the National Socialist Movement is one of the largest neo-Nazi groups in the country . Like the American Nazi Party that proceeded it , the group idolizes Adolf Hitler and believes only Caucasian people should be allowed to live in the United States .

MORRISTOWN , N.J. – A woman who repeatedly texted their boyfriend as they drove from work could be held liable in a civil suit if a judge Friday refuses to dismiss them as a defendant .
David and Linda Kubert of Dover , N.J. , initially sued Kyle Best of Wharton , N.J. , after they veered head on into them on Sept. 21 , 2009 , as they rode their motorcycle . Each lost a leg in the wreck , and Best pleaded guilty earlier this year to using a hand-held cellphone while driving , careless driving and failure to maintain a lane in Montville ( N.J. ) Municipal Court .
But the Kuberts ' lawyer , Stephen `` Skippy '' Weinstein , amended their lawsuit to include Shannon Colonna , then 19 , as someone who aided in Best 's negligence even though they are n't in the vehicle .
Cell phone records revealed during the suit 's discovery process show the pair exchanged more than two dozen texts during the day but stayed off the phone for about five hours while Best worked , Weinstein said .
In a deposition , Colonna said they did n't know whether Best was driving when they texted them after work . But they also said they may have known .
`` The sender of the text has the right to assume the recipient will read it at a safe time , '' Joseph McGlone , Colonna 's lawyer , said earlier this month in Morris County Superior Court . They know of no court ruling anywhere in the country that says the sender of a text is liable if the receiver causes injury while reading the message .
`` It 's not fair . It 's not reasonable . Shannon Colonna has no way to control when Kyle Best is going to read that message , '' McGlone said .
As punishment for their traffic offense , Best was ordered to speak to 14 high schools about the perils of texting and driving and to pay about $ 775 in fines .
Right before the crash , Best said they glanced down at their phone to see who had sent them a message .
A time sequence of the exchanged texts that was read in court showed they were the last to text before the crash . Best texted Colonna seconds before 5:48 p.m . They responded 31 seconds later . Best texted them back , and seconds later they called 911 to report the collision .
`` She may not have been physically present , but they were electronically present , '' Weinstein said .
Superior Court Judge David Rand said they expect to issue their decision Friday on whether to keep Colonna in the suit .
February is the hardest month . It is about survival . The brittle cold wind whips against the faces of cyclists as they suffer to turn over the pedals . There is a still warm bed they left , for what ? They left for the coming spring and summer , but certainly not for February .
February is the hardest month , so it was shortened . No one could stand the extra days , so they did away with them , leaving the bare minimum . Four weeks of windswept rain and freezing fingers is all anyone could stand , so that calendar was truncated—the extra days would be slipped in elsewhere . Every four years February is even harder . The suffering gloom and gray stays for a day further . March is denied to us for an additional 24 hours .
Through the depths of our East Coast haze we pedal though February searching for form . Ice cream headaches without ice cream happens in a cold only found on such a search . There is something inside that gets us out of that warm bed to struggle with layers of lycra , only to put our selves in pain during the hardest month of the year . Every ride ever undertook in February has been met with hesitation , but left with blithesome pride .
February is the hardest month so that we might know the spring . We should be so lucky to have 31 days in February so we would know the spring three days better for it . Spring greens are brighter when they have suffered through a deep gray winter . So it is with everything . How do you know the joys of winning if you have never been crushed in loss ?
Black could be called gray were it not for white . What would your fondest summer ride be without your wettest February trial ? Quickly throwing on bibs and a jersey would n't feel so good unless you have spent upwards of 20 minutes getting dressed in February .
December and January are cold , but not hard . A ride is so easy to skip in January . Spring is far off , and for pete 's sake , you 're supposed to have bad form in January . December and January are for the pros . They can train for their salaries in the depths of our winter at their off season homes in Spain and Italy . But now , February—in all their grotesque beauty—is upon us . Even as I type this , the gloom hangs over my little row-home mocking my inside-ness . February is our warning that the season is too close to put off anymore .
February is the hardest month because it is too late to wait it out . If you stay in that warm bed , you 've missed the winning break . It 's gone ; so far up the road it 's out of sight . You must slog it out against February so that you might not get dropped in spring . The time for excuses is gone . February was that excuse and now it 's here .
February is the hardest month and we need it to be . This is a sport for those who find something in the suffering . I ca n't deny I like to think of myself as someone who rides in February , taking pride in the look I get when I say that I rode in the mid-20s . Riding in February is dreadfully hard and that is why we should cherish it . We should cherish the context it gives to this sport , so that we might appreciate the beauty of cycling more fully .

Air Force spaceplane is an odd bird with a twisted past
BY STEPHEN CLARK
SPACEFLIGHT NOW
Posted : April 2 , 2010
More than a decade after its conception in the halls of NASA , and having snaked its way through multiple Pentagon bureaucracies , an unmanned military spaceplane is finally on the verge of launching on an unprecendented test flight .

A stubby-winged spaceship called the Orbital Test Vehicle will fly into orbit on an Atlas 5 rocket , taking a round-trip shakedown voyage for the U.S. Air Force . `` What it offers that we have seldom had is the ability to bring back payloads and experiments to examine how well the experiments performed on-orbit , '' said Gary Payton , the undersecretary of the Air Force for space programs . `` That 's one new thing for us . '' Payton , a former space shuttle flier and NASA manager , is now the Air Force 's top civilian space official . Liftoff should occur the evening of April 19 in a launch window opening at 6:49 p.m. EDT and closing at 9:12 p.m. EDT , according to an Air Force spokesperson . Several weeks or months later , the spacecraft will drop into the atmosphere and glide to an automated landing at Vandenberg Air Force Base , Calif . The 11,000-pound spaceplane is more popularly known as the X-37B , but its cost and ultimate objectives are top secret . NASA guided the project through its infancy before funding dried up in 2004 and the agency handed over its X-37 assets to the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency . The Air Force took over in 2006 after another programmatic shakeup . The civilian space agency no longer has any formal management role in the program , but NASA officials say the upcoming test flight provides an unparalleled opportunity to study how a small spaceplane performs during re-entry . `` We stay connected with the Air Force on the thermal protection system , [ and ] on the guidance , navigation and autonomous re-entry and landing , '' said Daniel Dumbacher , the former X-37 project manager at NASA 's Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville , Ala. `` We stay in touch with them for data-sharing purposes , but that 's the extent of it . '' Teams have been preparing the spacecraft at Cape Canaveral since it arrived at the launch site in late February . The X-37B was built by Boeing Phantom Works in California . United Launch Alliance is also readying the ship 's Atlas 5 launch vehicle . The rocket rolled to the launch pad at Complex 41 early Thursday for a practice countdown and fueling test . The launch team loaded propellant into the two-stage rocket Friday during a wet dress rehearsal .
The Atlas 5 rocket is fueled on the launch pad Friday .
After workers tow the rocket back inside the nearby Vertical Integration Facility , the X-37B space plane will be hoisted into place atop the booster 's Centaur upper stage . It is one-quarter the size of a space shuttle orbiter and can spend up to nine months in orbit , but the ship will be hidden inside the Atlas rocket 's payload fairing for liftoff . The Atlas 5 will use a larger version of its nose shroud to fit around the X-37B 's nearly 15-foot-wide wingspan . The Air Force is n't saying what equipment is stowed inside the spaceplane 's unpressurized cargo hold , which is about the size of a pickup truck bed . Potential OTV payloads could be as mundane as materials science experiments or low-cost technologies on the fast track for adoption into operational Air Force space missions . `` For new experimental space technologies , it gives us the ability to put them on-orbit , demonstrate whether they do or do not work , and then bring them back , '' Payton said in an interview with Spaceflight Now last week . Another likely application for the spaceship could be reconnaissance of war zones and foreign strategic sites , but launches from Cape Canaveral can only reach low-inclination orbits , limiting the spacecraft 's geographic coverage for such missions . Others suggest the OTV might deploy and retrieve miniature satellites or rendezvous with another spacecraft to demonstrate orbital inspection and repair techniques . The X-37B carries a large rocket engine mounted at the rear of the ship for significant orbit-changing and de-orbit maneuvers , but the Air Force wo n't divulge its specifications . Early X-37 concepts called for a propulsion system capable of changing the spacecraft 's velocity by nearly 7,000 mph . The space plane is designed to fly at altitudes between 110 and 500 nautical miles , or 126 to 575 statute miles , an Air Force spokesperson told Spaceflight Now . The spokesperson declined to specify the orbital parameters for this month 's mission . The Air Force 's plans for more X-37B missions are up in the air . A second flight is on the books for 2011 , but that launch 's fate is tied to the outcome of the inaugural mission , according to Payton . `` We 're waiting until this first flight is over before we decide on the size of any potential X-37 fleet , '' Payton said .

The OTV could eventually be partnered with the Operationally Responsive Space office , a military initiative to field new low-cost , adaptable satellite systems capable of being rapidly launched based on urgent needs . `` If we 're successful with this first launch , I would love to see us proliferate the X-37 idea and marry it up with Operationally Responsive Space , '' Payton said . `` We could have an X-37 sitting at Vandenberg or at the Cape , and on comparatively short notice , depending on warfighter requirements , we could put a specific payload into the payload bay , launch it up on an Atlas or Delta , and then have it stay in orbit , do the job for the combatant commander , and come back home , '' Payton said . `` And then the next flight , we could have a different payload inside , maybe even for a different combatant commander . '' Since its establishment in 2007 , the ORS program has flown tactical demonstration satellites and overhauled the military 's space acquisition and development paradigm for small missions . Although the X-37B is outfitted to spend up to 270 days in orbit , the first mission 's length will hinge on accomplishing all of its goals . `` We 'll have certain de-orbit opportunities just like the shuttle does , '' Payton said . `` We are n't married to any particular on-orbit duration right now . '' After completing its mission , the 29-foot-long spacecraft will fire its rocket engine to fall from orbit and glide to a precise touchdown on a runway at Vandenberg along California 's Central Coast . Vandenberg 's 15,000-foot-long landing strip was originally built for space shuttles returning from orbit . The OTV 's debut mission will be the first time the concrete runway has been the landing point for a vehicle gliding back from space . Edwards Air Force Base in the Mojave Desert of California is the spacecraft 's backup landing site . Despite rampant speculation on the Air Force 's intentions for the X-37B , a major goal of the test flight is to verify the spaceplane will actually work . Payton said the foremost objective of the flight will be a technical demonstration of the spacecraft 's design , fulfilling its role as an experimental X-vehicle . One of the mission 's more significant technological leaps will be the first attempted autonomous atmospheric entry and runway landing in the history of the U.S. space program . The former Soviet Union accomplished the feat with the single automated test flight of its Buran space shuttle in 1988 . The X-37B final approach will be guided by a differential Global Positioning System precision landing system to feed navigation data into the craft 's flight computer , giving the vehicle cues as it flies toward Vandenberg and lines up with the runway . Like the space shuttle , the X-37B will soar through the upper atmosphere enduring scorching temperatures with the help of a shield of heat-resistant tiles .

Tiles made of high-temperature ceramic material will protect the X-37B during the trip home . `` The X-37 re-entry environments were harsher that what [ the ] shuttle sees , '' Dumbacher said Friday . The space plane will approach the landing site and line up with the runway for a steep glide reaching speeds of nearly 300 mph . In the last few seconds of the flight , the craft will flare its nose , deploy its tricycle landing gear and slap down on the runway traveling well above 200 mph . Dumbacher , now the director of Marshall 's engineering division , said the X-37 touches down at a higher velocity than the shuttle orbiter . `` From the outside , it looks a lot like the shuttle , '' Payton said . `` From the outer moldline , the hypersonic drag [ characteristics ] and subsonic flight control system , it looks and acts a lot like the shuttle . '' But on the inside , the X-37B is a different breed . Instead of running on fuel cells like the shuttle , the OTV will unfurl a small solar array to produce electricity in orbit . And the X-37B uses electromechanical actuators instead of hydraulics to move its flight control surfaces . The solar array gives the vehicle a renewable energy source , permitting the X-37B to loiter in orbit for much longer than the space shuttle , which is limited to missions lasting a few weeks . Other technologies the OTV flight will test include advanced guidance , navigation and control , thermal protection systems , avionics , high temperature structures and seals , and conformal reusable insulations , according to an Air Force fact sheet . The Air Force manages the OTV project through the Rapid Capabilities Office , a top-level group reporting to a board of senior branch officials including the secretary of the Air Force , the Air Force chief of staff , and the undersecretary of defense for acquisition , technology , and logistics . The office `` expedites development and fielding of select Department of Defense combat support and weapon systems by leveraging defense-wide technology development efforts and existing operational capabilities , '' according to an Air Force fact sheet . Many of the Rapid Capabilities Office 's projects are implemented on accelerated timelines , the fact sheet said . NASA selected Boeing Co. to develop the X-37 in 1999 as a testbed for reusable launch vehicle technologies . The X-37 was later described as a demonstrator for NASA 's Space Launch Initiative and Orbital Space Plane projects seeking less expensive and more reliable access to low Earth orbit . `` The primary reason for selecting X-37 was the need to have a demonstrator for thermal protection systems and re-entry systems , '' Dumbacher said . `` We can do arcjet testing and other things on the ground , but you never get the right environment until you actually fly stuff back from orbit . The reason NASA stayed [ with the X-37 ] as long as they did was because of the thermal protection system technology demonstration aspect . ''

While the X-37 program was under NASA management , engineers dropped an 85-percent scale model of the X-37 named the X-40A seven times from an Army Chinook helicopter . The approach and landing tests occurred in 2001 . In 2004 , after NASA cancelled the Orbital Space Plane and started work on the Constellation program in the wake of the Columbia accident , the space agency transferred the X-37 project to the DARPA . The move instantly thrust the project into a murky middle ground somewhere between traditional white and black space programs . Unlike purely classified programs , the government acknowledges the X-37 's existence and openly discusses the vehicle 's design , but officials give only vague answers on the purpose of its existence . NASA had not started manufacturing a spaceworthy X-37 when its work was transitioned to DARPA . Engineers were focusing on building a full-scale vehicle for drop tests . DARPA oversaw the second round of glide and landing tests in 2006 using the Scaled Composites White Knight carrier aircraft . The Air Force announced its intentions to finish developing and building the X-37B in late 2006 . Throughout its checkered history , the X-37 was supposed to launch on the space shuttle and a Delta 2 rocket . The Air Force selected the Atlas 5 rocket in 2006 . The craft is the manifestation of the Air Force 's long-held , on-and-off again dream to operate its own space plane . The first time the military flirted with the idea of a reusable spaceship was the Dyna-Soar project of the late 1950s and early 1960s . The Dyna-Soar , also named the X-20 , was envisioned as a piloted spacecraft for anti-satellite , reconnaissance and even space weapons applications . After Dyna-Soar 's cancellation in 1963 , the Air Force turned its attention to an ill-fated manned space station called the Manned Orbiting Laboratory . It was cancelled in 1969 . The military contributed to the earliest conceptual designs of the space shuttle beginning in 1971 . The Air Force selected Vandenberg to host shuttle launches on polar orbit missions with classified national security payloads . But the Pentagon scrubbed plans to launch the shuttle from Vandenberg after the Challenger accident . The military 's last dedicated shuttle mission launched from Florida in 1992 . `` There are a number of differences between our shuttle experience and this bird , '' Payton said . `` Our top priority is getting the bird to orbit and getting it back down again . ''
With little on the line , the Toronto Raptors found some meaning in their final home game of the regular season — an encouraging performance from DeMarre Carroll .
Carroll keyed a run early in the second half , and the Raptors cruised to a 122-98 win over the Philadelphia 76ers on Tuesday night . The Raptors finished the year with a 32-9 record at Air Canada Centre , the best mark in franchise history .
Toronto wraps up the regular season with a game in Brooklyn on Wednesday .
Thanks to Indiana 's win in New York and Detroit 's loss to Miami , the Raptors will play the Pacers in the first round of the playoffs , which will start on the weekend .
Norman Powell scored a team-high 18 points in a team-high 38 minutes .
The Raptors had an awful second quarter , allowing the woeful 76ers to score 38 points .
They responded in the third quarter . With the returning Carroll sliding into Luis Scola 's place to play with the other four starters early in the frame , the Raptors went on an 18-6 run . They outscored Philadelphia 32-13 in the quarter .
This was Carroll 's first home game since Jan. 3 . They returned last week in Atlanta after missing the previous 42 games as they recovered from arthroscopic knee surgery . Carroll scored eight points in 21 minutes , the most they have played since their return .
The game was nothing more than a chance to pad their win total for the Raptors . Cleveland 's win in Atlanta on Monday evening locked Toronto into the Eastern Conference 's second seed .
Raptors coach Dwane Casey said they planned on playing fairly normal rotations on Tuesday , but that did not come to pass . The starting unit was the same as usual , but key reserves Cory Joseph and Patrick Patterson did not play . Seldomly used point guard Delon Wright and big man Lucas Nogueira were among the first players to come off the bench . Kyle Lowry and DeMar DeRozan were limited to 26 and 22 minutes , respectively .
The game marked the first time the Raptors played the 76ers since Philadelphia hired Bryan Colangelo to be the club 's president and general manager . Colangelo , who replaced Sam Hinkie last week , had the same title with the Raptors from 2006 to 2013 .
“ He 's a basketball lifer , ” said Casey , who was hired by Colangelo in 2011 . “ He 'll do an excellent job for that team as far as getting it together , getting them to play the right way , and developing a culture that the city can be proud of . ”
President-elect Donald Trump faces major obstacles in making the Gateway tunnel project a reality . The Gateway Development Corp. proposed more than a year ago is still many months away from becoming a legal entity . Management of this project on an interim basis by a simple memorandum of understanding between New York , New Jersey , the U.S. Department of Transportation and New Jersey Transit may go on into 2017 .
It is still unknown how the proposed $ 24 billion Hudson River tunnel ( connecting New Jersey with Penn Station ) and other infrastructure work will be financed . Moody 's Investor Services has questioned the ability of New Jersey to come up with its $ 6 billion share of the project cost . Others question how New York can find $ 6 billion for its contribution .
Interesting to note , the Metropolitan Transportation Authority is not a party to this memorandum , even though its Metro-North arm is looking at Gateway and other ways to add service for Rockland and Orange County residents into New York City .
Earlier this year , Amtrak and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey found $ 70 million to begin preliminary engineering , but this was a drop in the bucket . Preliminary engineering followed by completion of final design and engineering can be 5 % to 10 % of total project cost . For Gateway , that could be $ 1.4 billion to $ 2.8 billion .
Another $ 55 million was found to replace the Portal Bridge over the Hackensack River , but that was just a down payment toward the full $ 1.34 billion cost . For federal officials to deliver on promises to `` commit resources and accelerate environmental reviews '' will be difficult . New Jersey Transit staff and consultants will continue to be in the process of preparing detailed documents in conformance with the National Environmental Protect Act for another one to two years . At a minimum , a full blown environmental impact statement will be required , which for smaller federal projects has taken several years . So many transit agencies ask to expedite the environmental-review process for their respective projects that `` fast tracking '' is rapidly becoming a cliche in the transit industry .
Sen. Charles Schumer earlier this year suggested that actual construction can begin by 2018 , but they have since backtracked to 2019 . Even this new date is unrealistic . The environmental reviews would have to be completed and a finding issued by the U.S. Department of Transportation . Then the project would need to complete design and engineering work , obtain a full funding grant agreement , secure the full $ 24 billion and complete the procurement process for construction contractors . Real estate issues including obtainment of easements , relocation of businesses or acquisition of property also must be resolved . This will require far more time than the senator suggests , if past history for such projects as the Second Avenue Subway , East Side Access to Grand Central Terminal , and the ill-fated Access to the Region 's Core is any indication .
Gateway could be sped up and its costs reduced if some Buy America program requirements were waived , but will the U.S. Department of Transportation do so ? The number of such waivers issued to transit agencies in recent years can be counted on one hand .
The agency , Sen. Cory Booker and Schumer ( $ 12 billion ) , Govs . Andrew Cuomo and Chris Christie all have failed to identify or secure specific sources for their financial contributions to the project . There are no significant dollars programmed in the new Fixing America 's Surface Transportation Act ( FAST Act ) for Gateway either . This legislation makes rail and mass transit eligible for federal New Starts funding .
U.S. Transportation Secretary Anthony Fox has said up to $ 4 billion in New Starts funding might become available to Gateway . This would still leave a shortfall of $ 8 billion in federal and $ 20 billion toward the overall project costs . There is no guarantee that these funds will actually be authorized and appropriated by future sessions of Congress and signed into law by future presidents . The project would have to complete a competitive New Starts process , which takes several years .
There are dozens of other potential New Starts projects being championed by many of the other 98 Senators and 435 House members . The requests far exceed any available current or future New Starts funding . The Metropolitan Transportation Authority , New Jersey Transit , Port Authority , city Department of Transportation and others from the New York region all have their own projects competing against each other and the Gateway Tunnel for billions in New Starts funding . And how much could Gateway get ? The largest such grant was $ 2.6 billion for East Side Access , and Federal Railroad Administration loans have never exceeded $ 1 billion .
Amtrak secured language in the FAST Act affording it the ability to use some of the $ 200 million to $ 400 million in its operating surplus from the Northeast Corridor toward the new Hudson River Tunnel , but this needs future approval by Congress . Schumer believes that Amtrak will contribute 10 % toward the $ 24 billion total project cost . But even if Amtrak programmed $ 200 million yearly toward the Gateway Tunnel , it would take 24 years to come up with $ 2.4 billion for Gateway . Any assumptions that it would never take that long should consider the history of other massive transportation projects .

Like most of its competitors , General Motors is betting hard on autonomous cars being the future of transportation . But unlike Ford , Google , Uber , and others , GM has been pretty secretive about its self-driving cars , refusing to release images or footage of any public tests .
Today , Kyle Vogt , the head of the self-driving startup Cruise Automation that was recently acquired by GM for a reported $ 1 billion , tweeted dash camera footage of what 's described as a recent test of its self-driving car on the streets of San Francisco . We do n't get to see the actual car , but a GM spokesperson said it was a Chevy Bolt . Spy photos recently surfaced of the all-electric vehicle kitted out with self-driving sensors . GM President Dan Ammann , who is leading the auto giant 's self-driving efforts , was in the car at the time , according to Vogt 's tweet .

In the video , a green “ autonomous ” label can be seen in the bottom left corner throughout the short trip . The car travels effortlessly through the city , yielding to pedestrians , and stopping at red lights or behind double-parked vehicles . Unlike some of its competitors , it does not appear to run any red lights . At the beginning , text reads that the trip was facilitated using Cruise 's “ mobile app. ” A GM spokesperson clarified that the company is “ using an app to set pickup and drop off location during development of the technology . ”
Uber is offering public trials with its self-driving cars in Pittsburgh , and until recently San Francisco . ( The California DMV ordered the company to cease its test drives after Uber refused to obtain an automated driving permit . ) Ford has said it plans to release a self-driving vehicle with no steering wheel or pedals by 2021 . Google is planning on testing its new self-driving Chrysler minivans in Mountain View and Phoenix by the end of the month .
GM , on the other hand , has declined to offer more details on its self-driving plans . In late 2015 , the company made a $ 500 million investment in Lyft with the expressed purpose of building a fleet of autonomous ride-hail vehicles . Meanwhile , Lyft 's founders have said it expects a majority of its trips to be in self-driving cars by 2021 .
Back in October , Ammann told The Verge that the “ only testing that really matters is testing in the real world. ” They also provided some insight into GM 's position on the high-stake race to put functional self-driving cars on the road that is currently underway .
“ Whoever 's first to put a driverless car to scale actually on the road and operate without a safety driver sort of wins , ” they said . “ Hence the need to test in these real world environments . ”

The New York Giants and the Los Angeles Rams travel to England for Sunday 's Week 7 match-up , and while the Giants currently occupy last place in the NFC East Division with a 3-3 record , they are obviously a team that can present many problems for an opponent on any given day in the NFL . With two-time Super Bowl-winning quarterback Eli Manning and superstar wide receiver Odell Beckham , Jr. , New York is never out of any game it plays .
However , the Giants are also a very flawed team on both sides of the ball , and for Rams fans everywhere , that sounds awfully familiar . Both teams are at .500 right now after six weeks of play , and since this is a conference match-up , the winner will also gain a potential tiebreak edge if it comes down to playoff seeding late in the 2016 season . That means this under-the-radar game on the NFL landscape is actually quite important .
Giants Season Record : 3-3
New York has played a pretty tough schedule so far , although that is to be expected playing in the best division in the NFL . The Giants have posted wins over the Dallas Cowboys , the New Orleans Saints and the Baltimore Ravens—teams with a combined 10-7 record . They have also lost to the Washington Redskins , the Minnesota Vikings and the Green Bay Packers . Those three teams are a combined 13-4 this season .
The three wins have come by a combined eight points , while two of the losses were by a touchdown or less . This means the Giants have played in very competitive games this year against some of the best teams in the NFL . In fact , the Rams may be the “ worst ” team New York has seen this season so far , and that 's saying something since L.A. owns a win over the Seattle Seahawks .
Giants on Offense
Manning is 35 years old , and it 's been a long time since they led the New York organization to the postseason . In fact , the last time the Giants made it to meaningful January football was 2011 when they engineered a second Super Bowl upset over the New England Patriots . That 's actually the only N.Y. playoff appearance since the 2008 season .
This season , Manning is playing decent football , but the Giants player on offense that everyone focuses on now is OBJ . They have 581 receiving yards already this year , and they are coming off a monster game against the Ravens where they registered 222 yards receiving and two touchdowns . OBJ has averaged over 101 yards per game receiving for their three-year NFL career .
Giants on Defense
Over the last four games , New York has given up an average of 391.5 yards per game . That 's one reason the team only has one victory in that stretch , of course . In addition , the Giants have forced just three turnovers this season , and that inability to stop the opponents on offense has limited the offense 's chances to score points , obviously .
New York won two Super Bowls in a five-year span due to its ability to pressure the opposing QB , but this year , the Giants have just six sacks in six games . That 's not “ pressure ” at all , and while all six N.Y. opponents this year employ pretty good QBs , the team still has struggled to mount any kind of pass rush in 2016 .
Players to Watch : RB Rashad Jennings and S Landon Collins
Everyone knows about Manning and Beckham , Jr. , so the running game in the Giants offense is actually an underrated aspect to their potential success . Jennings is the starter , but he 's been ineffective in the three games he 's played this year . Averaging just 2.9 yards per carry in 2016 , way down from the 4.4 mark they posted last year with New York , Jennings has to run with authority and success for the Giants offense to fully thrive .
Defensively , it 's never a good sign when one of your safeties is the leading tackler on your roster . Collins has 41 solo stops this year , which is 12 more than the next best player on the team . That means a lot of opposing offensive players are getting through New York 's front seven with too much regularity , so if Collins ' name is once again called out too frequently by the PA announcer at Twickenham Stadium , then the Giants are in trouble defensively ( again ) .
Outlook
The Giants present a similar challenge to the Rams offensively to what the Detroit Lions did last week , and if Los Angeles ' own front seven is n't up to the task defensively against Manning , it could be another day like the one the Rams just suffered at Ford Field . The Rams ' health , therefore , heading into this match-up is huge . Assuming some of the nicks and bruises have healed , look for the Los Angeles defense to frustrate Jennings , force Manning into mistakes and help the Rams offense just enough to secure a close win in front of 82,000 potential American football fans in England .
Facing a looming $ 219m loss , Nintendo today restated its mission “ to pursue its basic strategy of compelling products that anyone can enjoy , regardless of age , gender or gaming experience ” .
This is marketing speak for targeting occasional players , in particular the very young and the old , folk who might not normally be expected to cough up for gaming products and certainly not the very latest ones . But it also revealed this strategy may not be working .
Paving the way for Nintendo 's full-year results , due to be announced after the firm 's current financial year closes on 31 March 2013 , Nintendo President Satoru Iwata revealed that Nintendo now expects to make a ¥20 billion ( £139.4 million ) loss and not the ¥20 billion profit it previously forecast . This despite a falling Yen , which increases the money Nintendo makes from overseas sales . Sales to gaijin account for 70 per cent of Nintendo 's business .
Nintendo 's ‘ games for all ' approach emerged in the middle of the last decade as the company 's penchant for games based on cartoon-like characters , in particular its iconic Italian plumber , Mario , began to appear to be unable to hold their own against more bellicose and more realistically rendered rivals on consoles from Sony and Microsoft .
The strategy served Nintendo well during the early years of the Wii , launched in 2006 , as it reached out to younger and once-in-a-while players with its wave-your-arms control system that neatly replicated the swing of a bat and the turn of a steering wheel . It also did a nice trade selling non-gaming products like Wii Fit , an exercise program , to the overweight and wheezy .
Can Mario keep leaping ?
The problem for Nintendo is that many of its target players are precisely the kind of people who have increasingly turned to smartphones and , more recently , tablets for the occasional gaming joys . Gadgets like these can provide similar motion-controlled gaming experiences to the Wii and , more to the point , allow the player to snatch a few moments ' flinging fowl in Angry Birds , a hugely popular phone game , during breaks and commutes .
That is driving casual gaming out of the living room . Wii sales were down from 8.96 million units to 3.53 million between Q4 2011 and Q4 2012 . Worse , Nintendo 's new console , the Wii U , which attempts to replicate the joys of gaming on mobile devices with a tablet-style controller , sold even less well : just 3.06 million units in the quarter . It is Nintendo 's first console for 16 years to play host to a Mario game written specifically for it .
Nintendo now reckons it will have shipped just four million Wii Us by the end of March , down from the 5.5 million it previously forecast .
The company 's many fans may look it its handheld consoles , the old DS line and its more recent 3D-enabled successor , the 3DS , to take up the slack . Nintendo says it shipped 153.67 million DS devices up to the end of December 2012 , but sales are falling : fourth-quarter shipments of its DS line combined fell from 4.64 million units in 2011 to 2.15 million in 2012 .
The 3DS fared better , with Q4 sales up 11 per cent year on year , from 11.43 million to 12.71 million . But that 's still far behind 217 million smartphones that shipped in the last three months of 2012 , according to market watcher Strategy Analytics . Indeed , Nintendo now reckons it will ship closer to 15 million 3DSes during FY2013 , fewer than the 17.5 million it forecast during its last guidance statement .
The company also blamed the reversal of its fortunes on the slow release of the big name games that some punters buy consoles just to play . It said it sold 11.7 million Wii U software boxes and downloads in Q4 2012 - on average , 3.8 titles per console - and expects full-year shipments to hit 16 million - four titles per console . The software totals include bundles , though not all Wii Us come with software .
Tablets are already out-selling notebook computers in many territories , and most observers expect demand to continue unabated through 2013 . Apple and Samsung may have recently sounded notes of caution that the smartphone juggernaut is beginning to slow , but hundreds of the millions of these devices will ship during the year nonetheless . That is only going to make it harder for Nintendo to attract casual gamers to its consoles .
Mario may soon need to go back to their day job . ®
At long last , the wait is finally over and the delayed Samsung Galaxy S8 and Samsung Galaxy S8+ are official . We have word of the long list of improvements , refinements and amendments compared with the previous generation , the Samsung Galaxy S7 .
Samsung has upgraded much of the old device for the new 2017 Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ ; the new handsets come with ultra high-resolution 18:9 Super AMOLED panels , which almost completely cover the front of each device . There 's no physical home key on the Galaxy S8 and the fingerprint sensor has been relocated to the back of the phone . Samsung has reworked the front cameras as well , giving customers an 8MP shooter with auto-focusing for selfies , and a 3.7MP infrared iris scanner camera for biometric security means . There 's an improved 12MP rear camera that includes advanced auto-focus and low-light sensitivity .
Under the skin , the Galaxy S8 comes with an industry leading chipset in the shape of the new Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 for the North American market . There 's plenty of RAM plus 64GB of internal storage and a microSD card slot . The battery capacity has been increased compared with last year , up to 3,000mAh for the standard Galaxy S8 and 3,500mAh for the larger Galaxy S8+ . Samsung has replaced the older microUSB slot of the Galaxy S7 with the newer USB Type-C port .
On the software side of things , the Galaxy S8 launches with Android Nougat under Samsung 's Experience UX interface , which is not too dissimilar from the Galaxy S7 . However , the Galaxy S8 managed to include the newly announced Bixby artificially intelligent assistant plus a dedicated hard key for quick activation .
These are just some of the major improvements Samsung has made to the new Galaxy S8 flagship .

An Abrupt Drop
Let 's turn back to our regular beat : the U.S. economy and its capital markets . We 've been warning that the Fed would never make any substantial increase to interest rates . Not willingly , at least .
Groping in the dark , Yellen-style
Each time Fed chief Janet Yellen opens their mouth , out comes a hint that more rate hikes might be coming . But each time , it turns out that the economy is not as robust as they had believed… and that a rate hike is n't such a good idea after all .
Mainstream economists regularly dismiss worries about falling employment and output in the manufacturing sector .
“ Do n't fret about it , ” they say . “ We have a robust service economy . ”
Well , on Tuesday , the news came out that the service economy is not as robust as we thought . Bloomberg :
An abrupt drop in the Institute for Supply Management 's services gauge on Tuesday to a six-year low is the latest in a string of unexpectedly weak data for August .
Besides , the promise of a “ service ” economy has always been a fraud . We ca n't all get rich by mowing each other 's lawns and parking each other 's cars !
US services ISM unexpectedly plummets to one of the lowest levels recorded in the post-GFC recovery . Economists were on average expecting a number in the 54 to 55 region – click to enlarge .
You can make money by offering services , but only if there is someone who can pay for them . And you can only pay for services if you are doing something that generates real wealth .
Wealth Drain
Just look at India . It has over half a billion people willing to do just about anything for peanuts . Services ? You can get all you want . But that does n't make India a wealthy country .
Services are better thought of as a drain on wealth , not a way of building it . Let 's say you want to go out to the movies . Instead of watching your children yourself , you hire a teenager from the neighborhood .
You pay , say , $ 20 for the evening . This results in an increase to the nation 's service industry income of $ 20 . And you had the benefit of the service . You had $ 20 . Now , someone else has the 20 bucks . Where 's the additional wealth ?
Manufacturing , on the other hand , creates wealth . You take $ 20,000 worth of labor and materials . You put together an automobile and sell it for $ 25,000 . The automobile is worth $ 5,000 more than what it cost to build it . You are $ 5,000 richer .
But wait… You will say that someone must be out $ 5,000 . But that is n't true . They had $ 25,000 worth of cash . Now , they have $ 25,000 worth of automobile . He 's even ; the world is $ 5,000 richer .
Teenager mowing lawn ( this one 's doing it for love ) vs. workers producing cars on Ford 's famous Model T assembly line . Which activity is more likely to create real wealth ?
Crack and Snapchat
Readers will be quick to point out how Silicon Valley has added to the real wealth of the nation with its many services and innovations . Social media companies alone are said to be worth $ 500 billion – evidence of how much wealth they are bringing to the world .
And it 's true – some are useful for improving productivity . They speed the output of real wealth . But even profitable innovations can destroy wealth as well as create it .
Crack cocaine and television , for example , have probably cost the nation a trillion dollars of real output . Are Facebook and Snapchat much different ? As in any other service industry , money passes from one person to another . But is wealth created ? Or destroyed ?
Assorted time wasters and wealth destroyers… snapchat and crack – to the right you can see the late Rob Ford ( former mayor of Toronto ) taking a hit from their crack pipe .
Check your children 's smart phones , tablets , and laptops . Let us know what you find . Foolish , idle , insipid – most of what we see in social media is a waste of time . And what about the internet ? Was that just a summer delusion , too ? Maybe . Since the internet took off , economic growth rates have been roughly cut in half .
And the median American household income has fallen 20 % when you account for real inflation , not the government 's phony inflation figures .
What kind of service is that ?

“ The force of the electricity shot through their body , lifted her , and threw them against a wall . ”
John Vibes
August 11 , 2014
A Native American Woman in South Dakota is suing their local police department and a number of individual officers , after a taser was used on their 8-year-old girl . According to the lawsuit , the young girl had a paring knife that their babysitter could not take from her , so the babysitter called the police with the hope that they would help them get the knife from the child without hurting them
However , as with many cases that we have seen across the world , the police actually made the situation worse when they arrived . When police arrived on the scene they made the decision to subdue the girl using a taser .
According to the lawsuit , “ the force of the electricity shot through their body , lifted her , and threw them against a wall . After the officers had stunned ( the girl ) into high voltage submission , they pulled the fish-hook like Taser darts from their chest , gave their emergency medical attention , bandaged the holes left by the razor-sharp hooks , and called the ambulance . ”
Dawn Stenstrom , the girl 's mother , was horrified , and soon after the incident the entire family moved away from the town and returned to the Rosebud Sioux tribe reservation .
They are now seeking damages from the city of Pierre , South Dakota , its former police chief , Robert Grandpre , and the four officers at the scene on October 4 , 2013 , when the incident occurred . They believe that excessive force was used on their daughter , and that there was no reason to use such a weapon on an 8-year-old girl . The police department says that their officers were following procedure , and the police chief claims that the officer who tased the girl could have saved their lives .
“ Given the circumstances facing the officer at the time , it appears from the report that deploying a Taser was the best viable way to defuse the situation , ” Wendy Kloeppner , the Hughes County state 's attorney , said in a statement after an internal investigation conducted by government agents . It was said that this was an independent investigation , but it was still carried out by people who were on the state 's payroll .
Stenstrom 's attorney , Dana Hanna , told CNN that the police acted inappropriately , and suggested that the investigation was a whitewash .
“ Four trained police officers surrounding a 70-pound , 8-year-old Indian girl , ” should have used less risky tactics , Hanna said .
“ One distracts her , another grabs the girl 's arm . That 's what they should have done , ” Hanna said . “ She had a kitchen paring knife , but had n't cut . They were a kid throwing a tantrum . They should have made an attempt to grab the kid , not use a weapon to throw them into a wall . A Taser 's not meant to kill , but it does kill . Many people have died after being hit by a Taser by cops . It never should be used on a little child . They certainly are n't presenting a danger to officers . ”
“ What is it really going to honestly do for the rest of their life as they have to interact with authority figures and law enforcement ? ” Duffy said . “ What 's it going to be like first time they look in the rear view mirror and law enforcement gives them a speeding ticket ? They wo n't shake that , ” they added .

Residents in the Cypress area are on high alert after three alleged sexual assaults have been reported in just two weeks , and investigators are looking into the possibility that at least two of them may have been committed by the same person .
This happened in the middle of the day . The attacker was bold , kicking down the front door to get to their victim . And now police are looking to see if they are the same person responsible for another violent home invasion 12 days ago .
On January 7 , police say a Hispanic man in kicked in the front door to a home in Cypress , tied up a woman inside , beat them and sexually assaulted them
`` I think it 's terrible because it should n't be happening , '' Cypress resident Janelle Andrews said .
Police say the attack happened while the victim 's two children were in the other room . The suspect stole several items before leaving .
`` We 're just not safe anywhere anymore , '' Cypress resident JoAnn Slater said .
The incident had residents on high alert . Days later , there was another attack . A woman sitting on this park bench told police a man came from behind her , took them to the ground and sexually assaulted them
`` You can not believe it . We 're talking about Cypress , '' Cypress resident Cesar Cabrera said .
Just Tuesday , several miles away , there was another violent home invasion in broad daylight . Police say a man busted down the front door , tied up their victim and sexually assaulted them
`` We are very worried because this is a very calm and quiet place , '' Cabrera said .
Residents spread the message about the two attacks on the Cypress news Facebook page , some posting pictures of new locks they 're installing . Others say they 're putting a sticker at the front of their homes warning that they 've had enough and are now armed .
`` I have one so I would say that that 's a great thing to do , you just have to be willing to pull the trigger if they get in . It 's you or them , '' Slater said .
Police say the suspect is in their 20 's , about 5 feet 10 inches tall , muscular thin build and was wearing a dark colored jumpsuit , jacket , gloves and work boots .

Internal police probe clears officer who shot and killed Gezi protester
ANKARA
The police officer who shot and killed Gezi protester Ethem Sarısülük during last year 's nationwide protests has been cleared of all responsibility after an internal investigation by the police.The probe stated that the police officer , Ahmet Şahbaz , used their gun in self-defense , as they were being targeted with stones “ big enough to kill someone , ” while also describing the mass protests as a “ coup attempt ” to overthrow the government.Şahbaz was sentenced to seven years and nine months in prison in the subsequent trial , though the prosecutor in the case had demanded a far heavier sentence of between 26 and 33 years in prison . The ruling was eventually overturned by the Turkish Supreme Court of Appeals , which argued the officer should be charged with “ premeditated murder , ” instead of “ possible premeditated murder ” in light of the evidence presented to the court.But police inspectors ruled out any premeditation and hailed Şahbaz for their behavior , stating that “ no fault ” could be attributed to him. “ It was ruled unanimously that no sanction is needed against police officer Ahmet Şahbaz , as it was understood that no fault can be attributed to them as they used their weapon within the limits of self-defense in order to avert a lynching attempt by protesters staging an illegal demonstration , ” the report said.The report admitted that Şahbaz carried out their duty under strict orders from their superiors . The Gezi protests were also described as “ nationwide demonstrations aiming to topple the government and seriously disrupt public order and peace. ” Şahbaz 's lawyer Uğur Ceyhan welcomed the report , assuring that it was thoroughly prepared after the analysis of video footage and testimonies.The violent crackdown by police on protesters during the protests that erupted over the redevelopment plans of Istanbul 's Gezi Park had triggered an international outcry . But police action was hailed by then-prime minister , President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan , who described it as “ heroic. ” Şahbaz shot Sarısülük as police was moving in on protesters in Ankara 's central Kızılay Square on June 1 , 2013 . Sarısülük died after being hospitalized for more than two weeks , becoming the third protester to be killed at the hands of police during the protests .
( Okay , so it 's really week two-and-a-bit , since we 're now nine ( NINE ! ) days into the campaign , but it works better as a headline . )
We passed $ 850K yesterday ( ! ! ! ) and we 're already closing in on
Apples & Penguins ( $ 900K )
and the Mac and Linux versions . I know a lot of you will be excited about that , and it makes us very , very happy . A bunch of us are ( at least parttime ) Mac users , Linux is getting bigger and bigger ( and rightfully so ) , and we want to see Dreamfall Chapters reach as many players as possible , on as many platforms as possible . And not just Windows , Mac , Linux .
But that 's probably a topic for another update , when we reveal more stretch goals .
For now our eyes are set squarely on $ 900K and , if we pass that
The Loremaster ( $ 950K )
which is a really exciting goal . Not only will our players be able to dig into all the rich lore of The Longest Journey universe , but the characters in the game will be instrumental in rebuilding the Great Library of Marcuria -- a grand city in the magical world of Arcadia . The library was recently destroyed , its contents scattered to the winds . By bringing books and documents back to the library , it will become both a repository of lore , and a measurement of how much players have explored and unearthed in the game .
It 's going to be a really cool feature . So let 's make it happen ! And after that , we have
A Longer Journey ( $ 1,000,000 )
which we 'll talk more about in the next few days . But we 've already revealed that this tier brings back Abnaxus of the Venar . Abnaxus was an important part of The Longest Journey , but their role was unfortunately excised from Dreamfall , so we 're very excited about the opportunity to tell their story again , and to revisit this strange , magical species that lives outside of time .
And speaking of magical species ...
The Manggoy
In their own , beautifully melodic language , they are the Oular -- children of the purple mountains -- but in Alltongue they are Manggoy , ape-people , strange and dangerous denizens of the northern mountains .
Contemptuously called 'makak ' by those who would reduce them to mere animals , particularly the militant anti-magical Azadi , the Oular are reclusive and mysterious , and there are not many of them left .
Or so it seems .
They are an old people , much , much older than humans , and though they have withdrawn from 'civilised ' society and are now commonly considered simian and beastly , they are nevertheless fiercely intelligent and cultured . They rarely communicate with anyone outside their close-knit society , however , and they are known to protect their territory and their own with a ferocity and penchant for swift violence that 's gained them another nickname :
Assassili .
Ruthless , inhuman murderers .
And in Dreamfall Chapters , you will need to travel to the northern mountains to find the Oular , and convince them to part with something very , very important .
New wallpapers !
Lastly , we just shared a high resolution version of our Kickstarter banner with fan site Thirteen Chapters , and they have created a bunch of different wallpapers . You can find those here .
Thirteen Chapters is run by RaMa , one of our oldest and most dedicated supporters , and it 's a site worth bookmarking . They 're going to be with us for years to come ( we hope ! ) and they will help us build a thriving and supportive community .

Pakistan 's fugitive former oil and gas chief has been arrested in Abu Dhabi on suspicion of embezzling $ 850 million in a scandal that could spark a criminal case against the prime minister , an official said Wednesday .
Tauqir Sadiq was arrested a week after Pakistan 's top court ordered a case to be registered against Prime Minister Raja Pervez Ashraf over the matter , raising pressure on the government as it nears the end of its five-year term in office .
Sadiq is accused of taking $ 850 million in kickbacks and commissions while head of Pakistan 's oil and gas regulatory authority between 2009 and 2011 , at a time when Ashraf was water and power minister . Sadiq fled Pakistan last year .
The scandal is the latest standoff between Pakistan 's judiciary and the civilian government , which have been at loggerheads for years .
`` We can confirm their arrest . They have been detained in Abu Dhabi , '' said Zafar Iqbal , spokesperson for Pakistan 's anti-corruption National Accountability Bureau ( NAB ) , which has been investigating the graft allegations .
Iqbal said that Sadiq could return to Pakistan `` in the next few days '' and `` as soon as the legal formalities are complete '' .
On January 24 , the court ordered a case to be registered against Ashraf , Interior Minister Rehman Malik and another member of the main ruling Pakistan People 's Party over Sadiq 's appointment in 2009 and absconding in 2012 .
It is one of two corruption cases being heard by the Supreme Court dating back to Ashraf 's tenure as water and power minister . Pakistan 's top judge ordered Ashraf 's arrest in the other case on January 15 .
On Wednesday , the court also summoned NAB chairperson Fasih Bokhari to appear Thursday over a letter they sent to President Asif Ali Zardari threatening to resign .
Chief Justice Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry said the document , which has been made public , amounts to `` criticising and pressurising '' the court .
In the letter , Bokhari accused the court of interfering in NAB investigations , particularly against politicians , and endangering the independence of their work .
Members of the government accuse judges of waging a politically motivated witch hunt against the administration , which in March 2013 will become the first elected civilian government in Pakistan to complete a full term in office .
In June last year , the Supreme Court sacked Ashraf 's predecessor over their refusal to ask Switzerland to reopen corruption cases against President Asif Ali Zardari .
I spent five days the week of July 27 in the audience at meetings of the NASA Advisory Council ( NAC ) . I forgot how much I love committee meetings . They were public meetings in Pasadena , California , so it was easy for me to attend , and with good Internet in the rooms I could multitask during those occasional times when my mind wandered or got bored . However , let me not be too facetious : The discussions were good and informative .
NASA faces many big issues , some about where we are and some about where we are going . The big one that I was especially interested in came across as a theme in many discussions : the tension between those who want a plan and those who want a flexible path for NASA 's human spaceflight program .
I state that as an either-or more starkly than it really is . One can have a plan that is flexible , and one can be on a flexible path that is well-planned . But there is a qualitative difference , and those urging a plan want prescriptive specifications : launch dates , payload specifications , vehicle assumptions , technology milestones , trajectories , crew size , precursor missions and more . With such a plan they contend progress can be measured and cost estimated . What they do n't say is that it gives them ( and everyone else ) a target they can shoot at and forces either planning an unsustainable program leading to slipped milestones and chaotic changing goal posts ( e.g . Constellation ) or planning a conservative one that disappoints everyone by its lack of excitement and ambition ( more orbiting of Earth with no destination ) .
NASA officials , to their credit , and despite catcalls from the outside , are not rushing into a plan — instead they are developing what they call an “ evolvable Mars campaign. ” I think of it as a concatenated organization of programs working toward the goal of humans on Mars . The programs are conducted , as recommended in several leadership studies of the past decade and most notably by the Augustine committee on human spaceflight , on a “ go-as-you-pay ” approach . As Congress attacks the NASA technology program or holds up the transition to commercial crew , NASA has to go slower because that 's how they pay . As Congress adds money for the Space Launch System , they can go faster — to the extent that concatenated programs can function out of synchronization .
The evolvable Mars campaign has already identified a huge issue , which the NAC agreed needs a lot more attention and analysis : the transition from the low Earth orbit human program to that in cislunar space that prepares astronauts and their support cargo for the journey to Mars .
This is most starkly brought forward by planning for the end of the International Space Station ( or at least NASA 's role in it ) and freeing up funds for the new cislunar developments in what NASA now calls the “ proving ground ” leading to Earth independence for future astronauts on interplanetary flight .
Previous human spaceflight program transitions ( Apollo to shuttle , shuttle to Constellation ) have been characterized by long flight gaps — gaps filled by Russia , which no one in the United States really liked . NASA is trying to plan the next transition to cislunar space without such a gap and without such a program disruption . That is going to be difficult : As several NAC members noted , “ The U.S. can not afford two human space programs. ” NASA has to try to make it one program . Agency officials said they are starting to do that as they redirect space station utilization for the goal of long-duration human spaceflight to Mars .
The flexible path accommodating such steps gives me the hope that despite the critics ' hand-wringing over the lack of a clear plan , we in the United States are for the first time making progress toward the human Mars goal .
NASA 's evolvable Mars campaign is not a plan , but it is already orchestrating different parts of the agency toward the Mars goal in a way that no previous program ( or plan ) did .
The Asteroid Redirect Mission ( ARM ) was formulated before the evolvable Mars campaign , but it creates a key initial steppingstone for humans beyond the moon . The Asteroid Redirect Crew Mission , proposed for 2025 at just about the time of the nominal end of the ISS program , fits well in the transition from ISS to cislunar , and serves as a potential gap-filler for human spaceflight during that time . NASA would extend the range of astronaut flights in the same time period as human flight development is finishing up on the ISS .
The SLS/Orion/ARM ( robotic retrieval and then a crewed mission or missions ) is a sustainable program even while ISS is operating . Afterward we can take the further “ evolvable ” steps in and then beyond cislunar space into the solar system .
The Jet Propulsion Laboratory study of evolving that flight capability to reach one of Mars ' moons before taking on the expensive development of the Mars landing suggests a sustainable program can exist within current budget constraints .
One can wish for greater specificity in a plan for reaching Mars , but as deep as I am into this subject I can not say whether the longer-duration ( for example , six to 12 months ) missions in the proving ground should be in the distant retrograde lunar orbit , on a six- or 12-month Earth resonant orbit , to a near-Earth asteroid on a native orbit , or to a sun-Earth Lagrangian point . A premature plan specifying which is a bad idea ; a better one is the flexible path built as we go , with evolvable technologies and sustainable costs .
The flexible path accommodating such steps gives me the hope that despite the critics ' hand-wringing over the lack of a clear plan , we in the United States are for the first time making progress toward the human Mars goal . It 's true that reaching that goal is , like it always has been , 25-30 years in the future . But we are building the rocket , developing the crew capsule , planning first missions for humans beyond the moon , creating the support infrastructure with solar electric propulsion for the cargo and the first in-situ propellant experiment planned for flight to Mars , and perhaps most significantly have all parts of NASA — human exploration , science , robotic missions , space technology and ( not unimportantly ) communications ( public engagement ) — playing together . That could be enabling — if only the Congress is open to the ideas .
NAC is apparently taking the action item to look carefully at the evolvable Mars campaign with an eye to helping NASA ease the transition away from humans in low Earth orbit . It 's not going to be easy , but watching NAC members try did boost my morale while another part of me was sorely tested from sitting in five days of committee meetings .

“ I should be able to make a secular argument for why what I 'm saying is right , ” explains Ben Shapiro in an interview with Dave Rubin . “ Otherwise we 're operating in different spheres . If I cite the Bible , it makes no difference to you if you do n't care about the Bible . ”
That is a profoundly important truth , which henceforth may be called the Shapiro Principle .
The Shapiro Principle recognizes the fact that the only common ground that human beings have for discussion , argumentation , or persuasion is reason—that is , observation and logic applied to the world in which we live . If a person has faith in God or another dimension or a supernatural world , that is their prerogative . But they rationally can not expect others to accept ideas based on faith .
If liberty-loving religionists embraced the Shapiro Principle , they could join forces with liberty-loving secularists—and , together , we could form an unstoppable , reason-based , pro-freedom movement .
Think about it : A mass movement that grounds rights , freedom , and capitalism in reason , observation , and logic would spell the end of socialism , communism , theocracy , and every other form of statism . If such a movement took hold , statism as such would soon be tossed into the dustbin of history , where it belongs .
Toward that end , of course , we need rational , secular arguments for both absolute morality and absolute rights . Fortunately , thanks to Ayn Rand , we have them . Here are essay-length primers on both counts :
So , to all lovers of liberty , whether religious or secular : Are you in ? Will you embrace the Shapiro Principle ? You have nothing to lose , and enormous value to gain—namely : a civilized , rights-respecting society for yourselves , your children , your grandchildren , and all generations to come .
The Shapiro Principle is a godsend . Let 's all embrace it . Let 's make the future what it ought to be .
EL SEGUNDO , CA—Toy company Mattel is under fire from a group of activists who say their popular doll 's latest incarnation , CEO Barbie , encourages young girls to set impractical career goals .
`` This doll furthers the myth that if a woman works hard and sticks to their guns , they can rise to the top , '' said Frederick Lang of the Changes Institute , a children 's advocacy organization . `` Our young girls need to learn to accept their career futures , not be set up with ridiculously unattainable images . ''

The issue was first brought to national attention by mother , activist , and office manager Connie Bergen , 36 , who became concerned when their 5-year-old daughter received the doll as a birthday gift and began `` playing CEO . ''
`` Women do n't run companies , '' Bergen said . `` Typically , those with talent , charisma , and luck work behind the scenes to bring a man 's vision to light . ''
They added : `` Real women in today 's work force do n't have Barbie 's Dream Corner Office . More often than not , they have cubicles—or Dream Kitchens . I mean , what 's next ? 'Accepted By Them Male Peers ' Polly Pocket ? ''

Despite the growing furor over the doll , Mattel 's top brass has indicated no plans to cease its production , insisting that the newest member of the Barbie family represents a positive role model for girls .
`` Young girls can be anything they want . There is nothing standing in their way , '' read a statement signed by Mattel CEO Robert Eckert , president Matt Bousquette , executive vice president Tom Debrowski , and CFO Kevin Farr .
Said Bergen : `` I graduated cum laude from Radcliffe and have worked hard all my life , and my career does n't look anything like Barbie 's . Currently , there are only nine female CEOs in America 's top 500 companies . To tell our daughters anything else is a lie . ''

Figures released by the Changes Institute indicate that , although women make up 46 percent of the work force , a mere 15 percent are senior managers . Lang maintains that these facts do n't square with the image of the career woman put forth by the doll .

Said Lang : `` Any girl who thinks that they can run a large corporation when they grow up is in for a bitter disappointment , and it is simply shameful that Mattel would seek to cash in on impressionable young girls this way . ''
CEO Barbie comes with a number of accessories and environments , including the Super Barbie Conference Fun Table , Barbie 's Company Dream Car and Underpaid Assistant Ken . But by far the most popular version of the doll has been the Talking CEO Barbie .
`` This doll says things like , 'Did you get me those projections ? ' and , 'We need to cut our operating costs by 10 percent , ' '' Lang said . `` It is dishonest to dangle this carrot of success in front of our daughters ' noses , when we know that the odds that a girl will grow up to order someone around are virtually zero . ''

Lang said they do not expect Mattel to recall CEO Barbie , but they want to send a powerful message to the people in charge .
`` When your daughter comes home crying because they were passed over for a promotion for the fourth time , what are you going to tell her ? '' Lang asked . `` It would be easier if she 'd been raised with dolls like Glass Ceiling American Girl , Service Sector Bratz , or Maria The White Housemaid . ''
Let 's go over exactly why we would choose to make this sandwich in this way . Nothing ever happens for a single reason . Starting with the bread , Honey Oat was selected because it is the most flavorful and substantial of Subway 's options . The Italiano Melt contains Pepperoni , Salami and Turkey as its meats , and these three are some of Subway 's most delicious options . It 's important to choose meats with strong flavor that supplement each other well and do n't interfere with each other . Pepperoni is a spicy and greasy , Turkey is a lean and juicy , and Salami is savory and hearty .
We add mozzarella to the mix for the purpose of providing a chewy texture as well tying together the meats structurally with the remaining ingredients . Next we add mayonnaise and Subway Vinaigrette to lettuce to form a significant , flavorful section . Lettuce is truly excellent for holding sauces , it has few peers in this capacity .

The creator of the popular architecture criticism website “ McMansion Hell ” took the site down on Monday after receiving a letter from Zillow Group in which the Seattle-based real estate media company demanded that they stop using Zillow content .
Kate Wagner , a 23-year-old writer and student in Maryland , posted a message on the McMansion Hell Tumblr page under the header “ Going offline for a while. ” In it , they wrote , “ Zillow is threatening to sue me if I do n't delete most of the posts on this blog . Anyone who can see this who can help , please contact kate @ mcmansionhell.com . ”
A short time later , the site was gone . On Twitter , Wagner shared the letter they received Monday from Christopher Poole , corporate counsel for Zillow .
Somebody help me , Zillow is threatening to sue me pic.twitter.com/mEiQ7ddiqS — bad house tweeter ? ( @ mcmansionhell ) June 26 , 2017
Wagner 's work , in which they critique the architectural styles of houses , relied heavily on the use of photographs from the Zillow site . Disclaimers on their posts owned up to this fact by making a fair use argument :
“ Copyright Disclaimer : All photographs in this post are from real estate aggregate Zillow.com and are used in this post for the purposes of education , satire , and parody , consistent with 17 USC §107 . Manipulated photos are considered derivative work and are Copyright © 2017 McMansion Hell . Please email kate @ mcmansionhell.com before using these images on another site . ( am v chill about this ) ”
“ If you love to hate the ugly houses that became ubiquitous before ( and after ) the bubble burst you 've come to the right place , ” reads a description of McMansion Hell which is visible on a Google search .
In tweets , Wagner said the blog is their “ entire livelihood ” and that if it goes they will “ lose absolutely everything. ” They also said they have until June 29 to do something and asks for anyone who could help them to “ please , please DM ” them
How I feel about architecture pretty much all the time… ( Greetings from Reykjavík ! ) Posted by Mcmansion Hell on Thursday , March 16 , 2017
Zillow 's letter disputes Wagner 's understanding of fair use and said that in addition to violating Zillow 's terms of use they were infringing on the rights of the copyright holder of the images .
Zillow sent a statement to GeekWire saying that its intention is for the photos to be removed , not for Wagner to kill McMansion Hell altogether .
“ Zillow has a legal obligation to honor the agreements we make with our listing providers about how photos can be used , ” the company said . “ We are asking this blogger to take down the photos that are protected by copyright rules , but we did not demand they shut down their blog and hope they can find a way to continue their work . ”
Last week , a judge partially overturned a verdict in which Zillow was ordered to pay $ 8.3 million in damages for copyright violation related to 28,000 images provided by VHT Inc. on the Zillow Digs website .
Wagner had just shown up Monday morning in a Washington Post video in which they explain why the McMansion architectural style — popular in suburban developments and apparently enjoying a comeback of sorts — is “ lazy ” and “ pretentious . ”
GeekWire reached out to Kate Wagner for comment and will update this story if we hear back .
Bundit Thanachaisetthawut of the Arom Phong Pha-ngan Foundation said problems arising from foreign labour do not constitute “ an emergency situation [ for which a Royal Decree ] is utmost necessary and unavoidable ” , and thus there was no need for the Decree on the Management of Foreign Workers Act 2017 that came into effect on June 17 .
Bundit pointed out that a formal decree allows the government to promulgate or amend a law without first seeking public comment , as is otherwise required .
They also noted that entrepreneurs and employers have expressed concern the hefty fines outlined in the act could result in corruption in the form of officials seeking and accepting bribes .
Anyone employing an undocumented foreign worker faces a fine of Bt400,000-Bt800,000 .
The Cabinet approved the decree in principle in March and quickly submitted it for Council of State consideration . It essentially merges two existing laws – the Working of Aliens Act 2008 and the Royal Decree on the Placement of Aliens for Work with Employers in Thailand 2016 .
Bundit last month participated in a seminar and public consultation on the decree organised by the Migrant Working Group and Solidary Centre , as did representatives of state and private agencies .
They said it was noted that the decree 's drafting process might violate Section 77 of the Constitution requiring all proposed laws to be subject to stakeholder input .
Seminar participants also criticised the proposed punitive measures and other aspects of the decree and recommended changes .
The decree prescribes that employers be fined Bt4,000 for every foreign employee doing a job other than what is designated in their or their work permit . A foreigner caught doing so could be fined up to Bt100,000 .
Employers face five years in jail and/or a fine of Bt2,000-Bt10,000 if a foreign employee has no work permit or is working in one of 39 professions reserved for Thais .
They face a fine of up to Bt100,000 if a foreign employee 's rights are violated or essential documents are withheld , and 3-10 years in prison and/or a fine of Bt600,000-Bt1 million per worker for making false claims about finding foreigners a job in Thailand .
I have made a new version of this project that uses a DC ion generator , you can see it here : https : //www.instructables.com/id/Make-a-Static-Electricity-Generator-Cast-Lightning/
In this video I show how to make a device that allows the user to gain the power of electricity . This high voltage generator can electrify a persons entire body with a static charge more powerful than rubbing even the softest footie pajamas on a carpet could ever muster . The electrical buildup can then be discharged with a touch to shock anything in reach .
Parts that may need to be ordered online :
Negative Ion Generator ( Ionizer ) ( I bought mine here : http : //www.allelectronics.com/ Search for SW-750 ) UPDATE : It seems that source of ion generators has been depleted . Here is a new one : http : //www.goldmine-elec-products.com/prodinfo.asp ? number=G1783
Automotive Power Converter ( Cheapest here : http : //www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004I1LF7O/ref=oh_details_o00_s00_i00 Or find one at an auto parts store )
Parts that can be purchased in a hardware or electronics store ( Such as Radio Shack ) :
Flux Core Solder
2 '' of Copper Wire
Heat Shrink Insulating Tubing ( Optional )
9 Volt Battery ( DO NOT USE A LARGER POWER SOURCE ! Doing so may be DANGEROUS ! )
9 Volt Battery Harness
On/Off Switch ( Any type will work , even a light switch if that is all that is available )
Sticky Back Velcro
Dual Sided Velcro ( Usually found in the form of cable ties )
Glasses Case
1 Gallon Bottle ( Such as a windshield washer fluid bottle )
Hot Glue
Aluminum Soda Can
Duct or Electrical Tape
Tools :
Soldering Iron
Screwdriver
Scissors
Wire Strippers
Hot Glue Gun
Sand Paper
Drill & Bits
File ( Optional )
I was inspired to create this video when I read the article posted here : http : //fear-of-lightning.wonderhowto.com/how-to/master-power-shock-people-with-your-fingertips-0133360/
That article is based off of the information provided in this even older article : http : //afrotechmods.com/cheap/negativeiongenerator/pikashoe7.htm
Both of the above use a design that contains the generator within a pair of shoes , but I decided that it would be better modified into something that could easily be strapped on and off over anything the user happens to be wearing . The design used in the article also has a nasty habit of shocking the bottom of your foot quite frequently .
The collapse of Target in Canada can be partly blamed on the giant retailer neglecting to re-create the U.S. Target , says a business expert .
That is , shoppers expected the same type of store that drew them across the border but what they found was higher prices and a lack of the products they wanted , said Barry Prentice , a professor with the Asper School of Business in Winnipeg .
My surprise is that they 're giving up so quickly . - Fang Wan , Asper School of Business
`` The service was n't the same , '' they said , adding Target maybe misunderstood the Canadian market .
`` They may have had signals , based on cross-border shopping , in which they thought , 'Well , all of these Canadians are coming down , they must love us . ' And perhaps they thought the Canadian retail [ market ] must be weak or something wrong if all these Canadians are coming across the border , therefore it would be a cakewalk to come in .
`` Things went wrong , obviously . ''
On Thursday , Target announced it is pulling out of Canada , closing all 133 stores and putting 17,000 employees out of work . It has already filed an application for protection under the Companies ' Creditors Arrangement Act .
The decision comes less than two years after the first Canadian stores opened in March 2013 in Ontario .
Fang Wan , an associate professor of marketing at the Asper School of Business , says hearing of Target 's business woes in Canada does not surprise them
`` My surprise is that they 're giving up so quickly , '' Wan said .
`` They just built a lot of the stores and they spent a lot of money . It 's such a new expansion , right ? ''
Stores in Winnipeg , Brandon
Target opened stores in the Kildonan Place and Southdale shopping centres in May 2013 , and the Grant Park shopping centre location in November that same year .
The biggest Winnipeg location , a 107,000-square-foot , stand-alone store near the Polo Park Shopping Centre , opened its doors just three months ago .
CBC News reporter Meaghan Ketcheson spoke to a couple of employees on the way into the Polo Park location on Thursday morning . They did not want to be interviewed but said they are shocked .
This 107,000-square-foot stand-alone Target store opened near the Polo Park Shopping Centre just three months ago . ( Meaghan Ketcheson/CBC ) `` I 'm just here 'cause I got a Target gift certificate from my daughter , $ 50 . Hey , I better get some credit out of this before they take off on me . '' Joe Medeiros , who was shopping at the store , said ,
In addition to the four Winnipeg stores , Target has one other Manitoba location — in Brandon , where the store employs more than 100 people and is the anchor retailer at the Shoppers Mall , the city 's main shopping centre .
`` That shopping centre , I think , relies on a lot of the foot traffic from that Target store , '' said Jordan Ludwig of the Brandon Chamber of Commerce .
`` I do n't know if they have any any plans going forward . We know that it 's been kind of a revolving door at that particular location . ''
Ludwig added that smaller cities like Brandon will be hit harder than others when the Target stores shut down .
`` You take 120 to 150 people out of our labour force here in Brandon , Manitoba , a town of 50,000 people — that 's a big effect , and it will have ripple effects for our local economy here , '' they said .
'Decided to cut their losses '
Prentice said the exchange rate changing probably had some impact on why Target 's prices were higher in Canada than the U.S. locations , but the Canadian retail market is also competitive , maybe more so than Target thought .
`` You have entrenched retailers here and coming in is very expensive to get started and established and they just probably had a hard time making ends meet and therefore it was n't a profitable thing for them to do , '' they said .
`` So rather than continue to lose money , which I suspect they were doing , they decided to cut their losses and retreat . ”
Target lost almost $ 1 billion in its first year in Canada , and while the losses have shrunk since then , the chain is still losing money daily . CEO Brian Cornell stated in a press release Thursday that the Canadian stores were on-track to continue losing money for at least another six years .
Target has hired international consultancy Alvarez & Marsal to oversee the liquidation and wind-down process . The stores will remain open while the company completes the that process .

Honesty seems like such a no-brainer of a requirement . But it 's caused a great deal of controversy in Canada over the past few weeks -- controversy heightened by the upcoming launch of a new , politically conservative Canadian television channel called Sun TV .
The controversy centered on Section 1.1 , Subsection 3 of Canada 's Broadcasting Act of 1986 , which specifies -- among other things -- that :
A Licensee shall not broadcast ... d ) false or misleading news .
At first glance , it seems such an obvious , common-sense requirement that I was a little surprised that the Canadians had felt a need to put it in writing , or that anyone could possibly argue against it . But with a little more thought , I realized how profound the stricture really was . I also began to wonder why we do n't have a similar requirement here in the U.S -- and how different our public discourse might be if we did .
The controversy over the Canadian rule erupted in January , when the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission ( CRTC ) , Canada 's equivalent to our FCC , proposed amending the rule to prohibit only :
... any news that the licensee knows to be false or misleading and that endangers or is likely to endanger the lives , health or safety of the public .
The root of the proposed amendment apparently goes back 10 years to a Canadian Supreme Court ruling that affirmed the free speech right of a Holocaust denier named Ernst Zundel to espouse those views . The Canadian Joint Parliamentary Committee on the Scrutiny of Regulations subsequently asked the CRTC to review its `` false and misleading news '' prohibition to determine if it violated free-speech guarantees .
The CRTC dragged its feet for 10 years . But then , this January , the proposed amendment was announced . Why the sudden action after 10 years of inaction ? That 's part of the controversy . The CRTC chairperson says they were ordered to to it by the regulatory committee , but one of the committee co-chairpeople says that 's not true . The controversy was also heightened by the impending launch of a new , privately-owned Canadian television station called Sun TV , now scheduled to go on-air April 18th . Sun TV is owned by Quebecor , the same company that owns the Toronto Sun tabloid newspaper , which has a reputation as a right-wing publication . The station is being promoted as a feisty , `` controversially Canadian , hard-news '' television version of the paper ( according to Quebecor 's president ) and an outlet that will `` take on mainstream media '' ( according to its vice president ) .

is true that the committee had been requesting a review of the rule for a decade . In any event , a huge public outcry ensued , and the parliamentary committee finally looked into the matter itself and concluded that a broadcast station did not have the same rights and freedoms as an individual and , further , that a broadcasting license was a privilege , not a right . The committee pointed out that stations already had to comply with numerous restrictions and conditions to get and maintain their licenses , including limits on the content of their broadcasts . Consequently , the CRTC Critics accused the CRTC of looking to change the rules to give Sun TV more leeway in what it broadcasts . But both the CRTC and the parliamentary committee deny any correlation between the two events . And ittrue that the committee had been requesting a review of the rule for a decade .

The committee pointed out that stations already had to comply with numerous restrictions and conditions to get and maintain their licenses , including limits on the content of their broadcasts . Consequently , the CRTC withdrew its proposed amendment . Canada will continue to require stations to refrain from broadcasting `` false or misleading news . ''
Or , at least , the rule will remain on the books . Apparently , the CRTC has never actually taken any action against a station pursuant to that rule . One of the arguments for the amendment , in fact , was that the CRTC lacked enforcement capability , and had never enforced the rule anyway . But the CRTC does have the ability to revoke a station 's license -- which might give a station owner at least a little pause before allowing its on-air talent to present unsupported theories as fact or get too overzealous in their conclusions or spin on the news .
But the question remains ... why do n't we have a similar requirement here in the U.S. ? Traditionally , both broadcast radio and television and cable television stations have been subject to regulation , including content regulation , by the FCC . Although that regulation originated from the fact that airwaves were extremely limited , and not accessible to everyone , the regulation continued even after the birth and expansion of cable television , because courts recognized that television and radio are `` uniquely pervasive '' in people 's lives , in a way print media are not . Indecent speech is already prohibited on broadcast television and , at least in theory , on cable ( although courts ' opinions on the best remedies for enforcing that goal seem to vary ) . Before its repeal in 1987 , both broadcast and cable stations were both subject to the `` Fairness Doctrine , '' which required the stations to present a balance of both sides to any controversial issue . So given that we 've long recognized that a broadcaster or cablecaster has power beyond an individual citizen or even print media , and therefore does not warrant quite the same `` free speech '' or `` free press '' rights without restriction ( as the Canadian parliament just concluded ) ... why ca n't we have a restriction on broadcasting ( or cablecasting ) false or misleading news ?
One reason is probably the same reason the Fairness Doctrine no longer exists . It 's laughable now , with the explosion of narrow-interest fringe websites and narrow-audience , right-wing and left-wing cable shows on Fox News and MSNBC , but in the deregulation atmosphere of the 1980s , the FCC 's rationale for getting rid of the Fairness Doctrine was twofold : first , that the Fairness Doctrine inhibited the broadcasters ' right to free speech , and second , that the free market was a better regulator of news content on television than the government . Specifically , the FCC said that individual media outlets would compete with each other for viewers , and that competition would necessarily involve establishing the accuracy , credibility , reliability and thoroughness of each story ... and that over time , the public would weed out new providers that proved to be inaccurate , unreliable , one-sided , or incredible .
One wonders , really , if the FCC had ever studied human behavior or the desire of people to have their individual points of view validated . Far from `` weeding out '' providers of one-sided , or even incredible information , we now revel in what New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof once called `` The Daily Me '' -- a selection of news outlets that never ever challenge our particular points of view . Contrary to the FCC 's theory , our particular public seems to reward , rather than punish , outrageous or one-sided news providers . And while that may make each of us feel nice and righteous as we pick and choose our news broadcasters and commentators , one would be hard-pressed to argue that it enhances the quality of our public -- or even our personal -- discourse . Especially given the questionable `` truth '' of many of the statements or inferences made on those highly targeted outlets . In theory , we could all fact-check everything we hear on the TV or radio , of course . But few people have the time to do that , even if they had the contacts or resources .

In theory , we could all fact-check everything we hear on the TV or radio , of course . But few people have the time to do that , even if they had the contacts or resources .
But forget about the Fairness Doctrine . Imagine , instead , if all those broadcasters were simply prohibited from broadcasting ( or cablecasting ) `` false or misleading news . '' Is it unacceptable censorship to require someone to be basically honest in what they broadcast as `` news '' -- and which we are more likely to accept as truth , because it comes from a serious and authoritative-sounding news anchor ?
Think about it . We prohibit people from lying in court , because the consequences of those lies are serious . That 's a form of censorship of free speech , but one we accept quite willingly . And while the consequences of what we hear on television and radio are not as instantly severe as in a court case , one could argue that the damage widely-disseminated false information does to the goal of a well-informed public and a working , thriving democracy is significant , as well . What 's more , if we really thought everyone had the right to say whatever they wanted , regardless of truth or consequences , we would n't prohibit anyone from yelling `` fire '' in a crowded theatre that was n't actually on fire . We would n't have slander or libel laws . We would n't have laws about hate speech . And we 'd allow broadcasters and cablecasters to air all words and all images , no matter how indecent , at all times .
Ah . But what if a broadcaster or cablecaster did n't know the information was false ? I suppose you could prohibit only knowingly airing false or misleading information . But on the other hand , if a station were at risk for sanction or a license revocation for getting it wrong ( even if the FCC rarely enforced the measure ) , it might motivate reporters and anchors to do a bit more fact checking -- and even , perhaps , a bit more research into alternative viewpoints -- before seizing on and running with a hot or juicy scoop or angle .
It 's odd , really , that the idea of requiring news broadcasters to be fundamentally honest about the information they project across the nation and into our homes sounds radical . Surely we would n't argue that we want to be lied to and misled , would we ?
Would we ?
Radical or not , it 's worth thinking about .

Since 2001 , when then US President George Bush announced their “ War on Terror , ” presidents and politicians both in the United States and among America 's allies , have repeated this phrase and have done their utmost to convince the public that indeed , the West was fighting a “ War on Terror . ”
Yet there is something disturbingly ambiguous about what exactly the “ War on Terror ” consists of , who it 's being waged against and how it could ever possibly be brought to a successful conclusion .
It is also often referred to as the “ Long War , ” and for good reason . America 's ongoing occupation of Afghanistan is the longest armed conflict in US history . Additionally , US troops still find themselves in Iraq , some 14 years after the initial invasion and occupation of the state in 2003 .
Because of the ambiguous nature of the “ War on Terror , ” politicians have been given much room to maneuver their rhetoric , explaining why more wars must be waged , more liberties curtailed at home and more wealth and power channeled into fewer and fewer hands .
What 's Really Behind Terrorism ?
The fanatics , weapons , supply , vehicles and finances that grease the wheels of global terror do not merely spring forth from the pages of the Qu'ran , as bigots across the West insist .
Just like any national army , the army raised and wielded in the name of terrorism has several basic components . Examining these components reveals a very uncomfortable but somewhat poorly hidden truth .
In reality , fanatics must be indoctrinated . And they are , in Saudi-funded madras and mosque networks wrapping around the globe . In the United States and across Europe , these madrases and mosques often serve as both indoctrination centers and recruiting stations . They operate as such with the explicit knowledge , even cooperation of US and European security and intelligence agencies .
One such center can be found in Denmark at Grimhøjvej Mosque in Aarhus which openly serves as a recruiting station for militants meant to fight abroad in US-European backed wars in Libya , Syria , Iraq and Yemen . The government of Denmark openly collaborates with the mosque to integrate these individuals back into Danish society when they return .
The mosque in Aarhus is hardly an isolated example . Such mosques backed and protected by US-European-Saudi money and political influence dot the globe , feeding recruits into a global mercenary army carrying out proxy war and staging terrorist attacks whenever and wherever politically convenient .
Both WikiLeaks and even the US ' own Defense Intelligence Agency has released documents exposing the role both the West and Gulf states such as Saudi Arabia and Qatar have played in the arming and funding of actual militants once they reach the battlefield .
Additionally , militants that have been indoctrinated , trained , armed , funded and battle-hardened by Western and Gulf sponsorship , return back to their respective nations where they are then cultivated for domestic operations . Terror attacks like those in Paris and Brussels , Berlin and elsewhere are carried out almost exclusively by militants US-European security and intelligence agencies have known about and even arrested but inexplicably released , allowing them to carry out their attacks .

It is often said that states like Russia , Syria and Iran exist as natural allies to the United States and Europe in the fight against terrorism . And that would be true if not for the fact that said terrorism is actually a deliberate product of US-European foreign policy . Were the West to truly wage a war on terrorism , it would already be deeply cooperating with these nations on the front line against groups like Al Qaeda and the self-proclaimed Islamic State .
However , terrorism is waged as a means of fighting the West 's proxy wars abroad , and to create divisive , paralyzing hatred , fear and hysteria at home .
Travel bans are created to intentionally stoke controversy and distract the public from the asupervisorstioned reality driving terrorism . As is evident in virtually all terror attacks carried out across the West , suspects are already known to security and intelligence agencies beforehand . These agencies simply need to stop them . Instead , they allow the attacks to take place , granting their respective governments political capital to channel more power into centralized hands .
While the US and Europe use terrorism as a function of foreign policy , they could not do it without their intermediaries in the Persian Gulf . Without the Saudis and Qataris serving as “ handlers ” for the West 's terrorist legions , it is unlikely such legions could be raised to begin with .
Targeting , rather than embracing , even protecting these state sponsors of all aspects of terrorism , from indoctrination and recruitment , to training , arming and financing terrorism on the battlefield , would be another essential step in a real “ War on Terror . ”
Survival Solar Battery Charger - Free Today ! Yet from President Bush to President Obama and now during the administration of US President Donald Trump , the US and its European allies continue to coddle the regimes in Riyadh and Doha , rather than taking any measures whatsoever to disrupt this terror pipeline . While the US remains in Afghanistan allegedly to “ fight terrorism , ” it refuses to take even the most basic steps to dismantle the ideological , political and financial structures in the Persian Gulf fueling that terrorism . A final means of combating and defeating “ terrorism ” would be to educate the public of just how small a minority is actually involved in it , isolating those groups exploiting and perverting ideologies from the vast majority who practice these ideologies constructively . Instead , US and European demagogues work ceaselessly to lump all of Islam into the “ terror ” basket , creating tension and hostility on both sides of an essentially manufactured strategy of tension . Instead of draining emotional and political resources from those seeking to recruit disillusioned individuals , the West is ensuring them an endless supply . A real “ War on Terror ” is clearly not being waged . Nothing presented by President Trump before or after their campaign victory in 2016 indicates a real war is about to be waged . In fact , much of what has been done thus far , has simply been the placing of additional bricks on a very predictable path toward the infinite horizon of this “ Long War. ” Ulson Gunnar , a New York-based geopolitical analyst and writer especially for the online magazine “ New Eastern Outlook ” , where this article first appeared .

Former F1 world champion and American racing legend Mario Andretti believes Max Verstappen is a `` very rare '' talent .
Last weekend Verstappen became the youngest race winner in the history of the sport when , at just 18 years and 228 days , they held off Kimi Raikkonen to take victory at the Spanish Grand Prix . It was Verstappen 's first race for the senior Red Bull team after being promoted from Toro Rosso , and Andretti believes they have proved themselves as the real deal .
`` He showed that spark repeatedly in the Toro Rosso last year once they reached F1 , '' Andretti told ESPN . `` He brought that Toro Rosso up to the next level just like Sebastian Vettel did . No one ever thought that a Toro Rosso would win , but Vettel did that in the most precarious conditions -- when there was a level playing field in the wet at Monza -- and they showed their capability then and Max is doing the same thing now .
`` Talent at that level is very rare . They did n't just show it as a flash in the pan , they demonstrated their promise and that 's why they were given the reward of going from the Toro Rosso to the Red Bull team .
`` Of course [ Red Bull young driver manager ] Dr Helmut Marko now feels vindicated even though they were criticised for this early season move but it 's obvious they made the right decision . ''
Andretti won in F1 , IndyCar and NASCAR -- as well as a variety of other forms of motor sport during their career -- but at 18 years old was preparing their first car to race on dirt ovals . When it was put to Andretti that they were modifying a Hudson Hornet with their brother when they were Verstappen 's age , Andretti said : `` I know !
`` From the inside , we are looking at them and saying 'Are you ever blessed , young man ! ' To have that chance at that age and to have been prepared so well , it 's a golden opportunity but they earned it .
`` He took advantage of everything that was at their disposal and they did a remarkable job . ''
Both Andretti 's sons went on to race in motor sport and their grandson Marco Andretti is currently racing in IndyCar . The 1978 world champion said they could sympathise with the emotions Verstappen 's father Jos must be feeling as they see their son succeed in F1 .
`` I 'm very happy for Jos because I 'm in that position too and have been watching my kids compete and my grandkid now , so I know the satisfaction that brings to the family . I think that Max has cemented themselves in the world of F1 and many of the experts are looking at them as a potential world champion , no doubt about it . ''
We Bahamians in L.A. enjoyed another gathering with our Bahamian Special Olympians Monday night at a reception hosted by the Bahamas Honourary Consul in Los Angeles , Cedric Scott .
Not only was the gathering a wonderful opportunity to get to know the athletes , coaches and families of Team Bahamas a bit better , but it was a terrific way to celebrate our first medals — two silvers and a gold — won by swimmers Cornel McClain and Lavontae Clarke .
While their teammates relaxed and mingled , a few Bahamian athletes competed into the early evening . Just before the reception ended , we received news that swimmers Serena Newton and Deron Forbes had won silver and bronze medals , respectively .
And the winning continued into Tuesday . As of yesterday afternoon , Team Bahamas had won a total of seven medals , according to the Results page on the Special Olympics website :
Congratulations to all our Bahamian athletes and coaches . We wish you much success over the week ahead !

LOUISVILLE , Ky. – A research participant at the University of Louisville with a complete spinal cord injury , who had lost motor function below the level of the injury , has regained the ability to move their legs voluntarily and stand six years after their injury .
A study published today in Scientific Reports describes the recovery of motor function in a research participant who previously had received long-term activity-based training along with spinal cord epidural stimulation ( scES ) . In the article , senior author Susan Harkema , Ph.D. , professor and associate director of the Kentucky Spinal Cord Injury Research Center ( KSCIRC ) at the University of Louisville , and their colleagues , report that over the course of 34.5 months following the original training , the participant recovered substantial voluntary lower-limb motor control and the ability to stand independently without the use of scES .
“ Activity-dependent plasticity can re-establish voluntary control of movement and standing after complete paralysis in humans even years after injury , ” Harkema said . “ This should open up new opportunities for recovery-based rehabilitation as an agent for recovery , not just learning how to function with compensatory strategies , even for those with the most severe injuries . ”
Previous research at KSCIRC involving four participants with chronic clinically motor-complete spinal cord injury found that activity-based training with the use of scES – electrical signals delivered to motor neurons in the spine by an implanted device – allowed the participants to stand and to perform relatively fine voluntary lower limb movements when the scES device was activated . Andrew Meas was one of the four participants in that study .
The original training protocol included daily one-hour activity-based training sessions with the aid of epidural stimulation . During these sessions , the participant trained on standing activity for several months , followed by several months of training on stepping .
After completing a nine-month training program in the lab , Meas continued activity-based stand training at home . After a year of independent training , they returned to the lab to train for three months in a revised activity-based training schedule . The revised training called for two daily one-hour training sessions and included both stand and step training each day , all with the aid of epidural stimulation .
After that training , Meas was able to voluntarily extend their knees and their hip flexion was improved . In addition , using their upper body and minimal additional assistance to reach a standing position , they were able to remain in a standing position without assistance and even stand on one leg , without the use of epidural stimulation .
“ We observed that in participants we have worked with so far , eight months of activity-based training with stimulation did not lead to any improvement without stimulation , ” said Enrico Rejc , Ph.D. , assistant professor in the UofL Department of Neurological Surgery and the article 's first author . “ This participant kept training at home and , after several months , they came back to the lab and we tried a different training protocol . After a couple of months of training with the new protocol , we surprisingly observed that they were able to stand without any stimulation – with two legs and with one leg – using only their hands for balance control . ”
The authors suggest that several mechanisms may be responsible for Meas 's recovery of mobility , including the sprouting of axons from above the point of injury into areas below the lesion . Another possible explanation may be that the activity-based training with scES promoted remodelling of connections among neurons in the spinal cord .
In addition , they suggest that the participant 's own effort at voluntary movement may have been a factor in the recovery . During the revised training , Meas was attentive and focused on the trained motor task , actively attempting to contribute to the motor output .
“ The voluntary component of them trying constantly with spinal stimulation on and while performing motor tasks can lead to unexpected recovery , ” Rejc said .
“ The human nervous system can recover from severe spinal cord injury even years after injury . In this case , they were implanted with the stimulator four years after their injury . We saw motor recovery two years later—so six years after injury , ” Rejc said . “ It is commonly believed that one year from injury , you are classified as chronic and it 's likely that you will not improve any more . This data is proof of principle that the human nervous system has much greater recovery capabilities than expected . ”
Funding for the research in Harkema 's lab is supported by the Christopher & Dana Reeve Foundation , the Leona M. and Harry B. Helmsley Charitable Trust , Medtronic and the National Institutes of Health .
“ We are enormously excited about this development in Dr. Harkema 's work , as it not only validates the promise of effective treatments for spinal cord injury , but further demonstrates the spinal cord 's ability to recover after severe trauma , ” said Peter Wilderotter , president & CEO of the Christopher & Dana Reeve Foundation . “ As we continue to support and fund Dr. Harkema 's research , it is awe-inspiring to see another breakthrough on the path to cures for paralysis , and how much this particular treatment has improved quality of life and health for Drew . ”

Proponents of the Northern Gateway pipeline proposal seem hell-bent for leather on conducting what may be the most inept natural resource project application in B.C . history . Their place in the Canadian business school textbooks is assured , under the heading `` Enbridge to Nowhere . ''
An initial unconvincing ad blitz showing happy families frolicking amongst interlocking fronds was followed by a scathing U.S. National Transportation Safety Board report on Enbridge 's disastrous Kalamazoo River spill , one of the worst inland oil spills on record .
When NSTB Chairman Deborah Hersman characterized the company 's appalling breakdown of safety response as reminiscent of the Keystone Kops , then-Enbridge CEO Patrick Daniel countered by quoting the children 's author , Lemony Snicket . It was , they said , all just a `` Series of Unfortunate Events . ''
Not to be outdone in the fiction department , the company topped everything with yet another animated ad campaign in which the islands crowding the proposed Douglas Channel supertanker pathway into Kitimat magically vanished .
Enbridge 's latest act of attempted self-immolation consists of a petition that the National Energy Board Joint Review Panel compel funding information from conservation critics , apparently on the basis that there is something improper about major American science-based foundations being involved in Canadian issues .
Does Enbridge truly expect the NEB to toss aside the evidence of critics as contaminated by foreign influence when it is itself 27 per cent foreign owned ? Two of its 10 partners in Northern Gateway ( Sinopec and Total ) are also foreign owned , while another ( Nexen ) is subject to a Chinese takeover bid by CNOOC and the identities of four other partners are secret .
It 's pretty simple . As Enbridge well knows , the NEB Joint Review Panel does n't care about American foundations . It assesses the reliability of complex data and deals with international parties and interests all the time . If evidence were flown in from Mars the NEB Joint Review Panel would accept it , so long as it was reliable , relevant , and submitted according to the rules . The review panel must sift through and weigh masses of conflicting evidence over a tight timeline , and wo n't have any intention of going on a time-consuming wild goose chase of investigating all the participants .
In other words , this latest gambit is not directed at the NEB , but is rather a PR stratagem to change a disastrous media narrative by peddling a recycled news story that did n't work the first time . Everybody in British Columbia already knows about the American foundations and they do n't care .
Curiously , given the events of the past year , Canadians might be surprised by what we do n't know about the supposed foreign radicals backing Tides Canada and other conservation groups . Most of us do n't know , for instance , that the Harper government itself openly and vigorously pursued these same American foundations as financial partners in a well-publicized 2006 agreement brokered by Tides . None of this was secret at the time , in fact the federal government held a press conference to announce it .
Many , if not all , of the foundations that Enbridge now wants `` exposed '' contributed a combined $ 60 million to a $ 120 million partnership with the Canadian and BC governments , preserving some 72,000 sq . km of pristine forests , river inlets and coastal waters in and around Kitimat , now known as the Great Bear Rainforest . By remarkable coincidence the Great Bear Rainforest protected waters include the asupervisorstioned Douglas Channel entrance to the proposed pipeline port .
Suddenly all the major donors celebrated by the Harper government just a few years ago are incredibly inconvenient .
So it comes as no surprise that Enbridge is protesting their involvement , and our own federal ministers now demonizes them as radical money-laundering interlopers .
Reality could hardly be more different . The impugned American organizations are among the world 's largest , most respected and mainstream scientific research and humanitarian foundations , and routinely partner with governments and NGO 's at the highest level across the globe . They are light years removed from the radical wing-nuts they 've been painted to be .
A CLOSER LOOK
It would do British Columbians and Canadians well if we did investigate these foundations more thoroughly . We might be pleasantly surprised by the results .
Take the first named suspect , the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation . Gordon and Betty Moore are corporate and philanthropic giants in Silicon Valley and the San Francisco Bay area , and their impact on scientific research and conservation is legendary and global . Co-inventor of the semi-conductor and co-founder of Intel , Gordon Moore is the author of Moore 's Law . The former board chair of Cal-Tech , Moore and their wife have donated $ 600 million for scientific research there . They are the recipient of the U.S. Presidential Medal of Freedom .
With assets of almost $ 6 billion , the Moore Foundation has funded over $ 200 million to protect the Amazon River Basin , $ 250 million to build the largest land-based telescope in the world , and has put millions into tracking the path of radioactive materials from the Fukushima nuclear disaster across the Pacific to North America , so local governments can respond appropriately , to give just a few examples . They have particular interest in marine habitats along the western North American coastline and across the North Pacific to Russia and Japan , which is how they happen to be involved in Canada 's Great Bear Rainforest .
The achievements of the other enumerated foundations are equally stellar . The trustees and boards of governors of each organization boasts many of the world 's most respected scientists and civic leaders , including :
Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation :
Dr. Bruce Alberts , Editor-in-Chief of the academic journal Science , and for 12 years president of the US National Academy of Sciences ,
Dr. Rosina Bierbaum , White House Director of Science and Technology Policy
Packard Foundation :
Dr Donald Kennedy , former President , Stanford University and co-chair of the US National Academies ' Committee on Science Technology , and the Law
Cole Wilbur , Director of the Institute for Global Ethics and former interim CEO of the US Council on Foundations .
Hewlett Foundation :
Paul Brest , former Dean of Stanford Law School
Dr. Harvey Fineburg , former Provost of Harvard University and president of the US National Academies of Science Institute of Medicine .
Rockefeller Brothers Fund :
Nicholas Burns , retired senior diplomat and 3rd ranking member of the US State Department under both Clinton and Bush ; Professor of Diplomacy and International Politics at Kennedy School of Government , Harvard University
The list of scientific , academic and public service luminaries involved with the foundations goes on and on . You can read more about these organizations and their history with the Harper government in my Vancouver Observer piece here .
Agree or disagree with the scientific conclusions and advocacy of these foundations as you will , but their integrity and credentials are beyond reproach . We should welcome their participation in the debate around proper flight attendantship of natural habitats .
Benicàssim , Spain — The decision to drop Matisyahu from the line-up of an obscure Spanish reggae festival became so controversial that the U.S. government and even Time magazine weighed in on the debate , seemingly unusual decisions concerning a foreign event of which few Americans are aware .
By Wednesday , just before Rototom Sunsplash issued an apology , the World Jewish Congress demanded action from the Spainish Prime Minister and the U.S. Embassy issued a statement calling the decision “ troubling , ” as reported in the media .
With accusations of anti-Semitism swirling in the decision to cancel the Jewish reggae singer 's performance , it 's important to look deeper into the origins of the controversy in the Boycott , Divest and Sanction ( BDS ) movement . The decision to boycott Matisyahu , whose real name is Matthew Miller , was not based on their faith but on their direct support for Zionism and the Israeli government .
Miller was due to perform on Saturday at the Rototom Sunsplash Festival , a reggae music event in Benicàssim , north of Valencia , Spain until organizers canceled the appearance under pressure from local BDS activists . Then , just days after news of the announcement first appeared in the media , festival organizers apologized and published a new invitation for Matisyahu to perform as scheduled , according to Al Jazeera America .
The media and advocates for Israel were not kind to the festival organizers during the days between the initial announcement and subsequent apology . On Tuesday , Time magazine published an Op-Ed by Max Webb , Senior Rabbi of Sinai Temple in Los Angeles , where they linked the decision to uninvite Matisyahu to “ a wave of anti-Semitism ” which they fear is “ sweeping across Europe . ”
Webb echoed many others in the American and Spanish media in writing ,
The Jewish-American rapper Matisyahu was recently disinvited from a concert in Spain because they would not sign a statement endorsing a Palestinian state . Matisyahu is not a citizen of Israel . They do not vote in its elections or create its policy . This was not a statement of belief but an unfairness based on the fact that Matisyahu is a Jew .
Matisyahu defended their actions on their Facebook page on Monday , saying that while the local BDS Movement wanted them to sign a letter or make a video clearly stating their positions on Zionism and the Israel-Palestine conflict , they support “ peace and compassion for all people , ” before going on to state , “ I do not insert politics into my music. ” They also suggested they were singled out as an openly Jewish-American performer .
However , Ali Abunimah , an author and co-founder of the Electronic Intifada , a Palestinian news and advocacy site , argued that the BDS Movement targeted Miller not because he 's Jewish , but because of Matisyahu 's vocal support of Israel 's war crimes :
“ Miller was vocal in their support for Israel 's attack on the Gaza-bound flotilla in May 2010 , which killed 10 people aboard the Mavi Marmara . ‘ Whether or not the ships should have been bringing aid to Gaza , those territorial waters belong to Israel – it 's internationally agreed , ' they claimed in an interview with The Jewish Chronicle . ”
Matisyahu performed at AIPAC 's 2015 policy conference , a major source of lobbying for continued U.S. foreign aid to Israel , and has denied the historical existence of Palestine , a popular view among Zionists , reported Abunimah . And not only has Miller tweeted out pro-Israel propaganda that attempts to justify illegal West Bank settlements , but their 2012 hit song “ Summer , ” from their album “ Spark Seeker ( which was partially recorded in Israel ) was also used in a video from Israel 's Ministry of Foreign Affairs . Abunimah also revealed that Zed Films , which produced this and other propaganda videoes , is also the producer of the official video of “ Sunshine . ”
Abunimah concluded that ,
The history of windsurfing if full of hidden secrets , untold tales , controversial debates , and unique testimonials . The truth behind the invention of the sport itself is not absolutely clear , but a few names are inevitably linked to windsurfing .
Diane and Hoyle Schweitzer , S. Newman Darby , Jim Drake , Peter Chilvers , Arnaud de Rosnay and Richard Eastaugh are some of the characters deeply connected to the birth of the wind sport .
In `` Wind & Water - The Invention of Windsurfing , '' director Bill Weir gathered historical footage and relevant information about the origins of the outdoor activity . Weir succumbed to brain cancer ( 1963-2009 ) but they left a paramount documentary .
Their work is pretty impressive . Bill talks with Woody Brown , a pioneer surfer and sail designer , who reveals how , back in the 1930s , wave riders used to roll out portable sails to get back to the beach with the power of the wind .
American surf writer Drew Kampion also shares relevant data regarding the invention of windsurfing . For example , did you know that Tom Blake designed the first modern sailboard ?
However , the first proper windsurfing model only comes in 1964 . S. Newman Darby introduced their invention to a surf magazine , but the editors told them `` that was not surfing . '' And so their article ended up being published in the August 1965 edition of Popular Science .
A few years later , Jim Drake and Hoyle Schweitzer added the mechanical system that allows sails to rotate , control power and board direction . However , the universal joint had been previously introduced by Darby . The dispute over the `` ownership '' of the pivoting system would continue for decades , in Cold War fashion .
Anyway , the duo filed the patent for the `` Wind-Propelled Apparatus '' on the 27th March , 1968 . It was Patent US3487800 A . But their project had to get in the water first . On May 3rd , 1967 , at Marina del Rey , in California , the windsurfer model got tested .
The sport struggled to find its market but , in the end , windsurfing became one of the most popular water sports in the planet . In the 1990s , Jim Drake considered they were the `` re-inventor '' of the universal joint used in windsurf boards , alongside Newman Darby . But the peace pipe was never smoked .
In 22 minutes and 25 seconds , you 'll learn a lot about windsurfing . The evolution of the gear , the innovative changes in the equipment , the challenges of wave sailing , the lifestyle and the first stars of the sport . Bill Weir did a great job , although they could not finish it completely . All windsurfers should thank them for this .
LONDON — In a sign that Egypt 's strained relations with the international oil industry may be improving , BP said on Friday that it had reached an agreement to invest with a partner about $ 12 billion to develop natural gas resources in the country .
The oil company , based in London , said it would develop a large quantity of offshore gas , equivalent to about one-quarter of Egypt 's output , and bring it onshore to be consumed by customers . Gas from the project , called West Nile Delta , is expected to begin flowing in 2017 . BP said that additional exploration might lead to a doubling of the amount of gas available .
“ The project underlines BP 's commitment to the Egyptian market and is a vote of confidence in Egypt 's investment climate and economic potential , ” the company said in the announcement .
The deal is a potential boon for the government of President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi , the former military chief who has been in power since 2013 . BP is also taking a very different approach to the Egyptian market than rivals like BG , another British company .

Jordan Henderson looks set to miss Liverpool 's next three games at least as Jurgen Klopp said the Reds had to be careful with their captain as they recover from an ongoing foot problem .
The Reds boss also revealed that Daniel Sturridge has no chance of involvement in the 228th Merseyside Derby and their return to training this week was only with the rehab coach and did not constitute a return to `` training '' per se .
Klopp told their pre-derby press conference : `` Jordan has unfortunately had a little setback , he 's not in team training up til now , that 's how it is .
`` I ca n't say in this moment how long - hopefully not too long . Yes I know when we were here last time I said I hoped they would be in training in this week but they are n't .
`` So next week looks like this too , so we have to wait for this . ''
If Henderson ca n't train next week they look set to miss the derby followed by the Bournemouth visit to Anfield on Wednesday and the tough looking trip to Stroke on Grand National day on the Saturday .
Asked if there was a chance Liverpool would need to do further explorations on Henderson 's injury , the Reds boss suggested the injury required time and not intervention .

`` It 's all a question of time unfortunately , there 's nothing we could do . It 's a situation , sometimes it 's not a big issue but big enough , with Hendo you know if there was a little chance that they could run , train , they would do it but we have to be really careful with him , that 's how it is .
`` We can not take a risk . It 's always too long with all injuries , perhaps it 's not the best time for us at the moment in this part of the game but nothing else to do .
`` It 's the treatment they get of course , the things you do of course and then wait for the moment when he 's back again . ''
Daniel Sturridge will also be absent from the Liverpool bench for a while yet .
Klopp added : `` No chance , I heard he 's back to training but I do n't know who gave this information . When a player is on the pitch with the rehab coach that 's not back to training .
`` That 's the situation at the moment . He 's in a good way but no chance for the weekend . ''
“ They are young men , ” they said , speaking of the kidnappers . “ And most of these ladies will be turned into their sex slaves and cooks . ”
Ten of the girls escaped as they “ were forced to cook for the Boko Haram , ” the governor said . “ They were told to use the leaves of the trees to clean the plates . That is the opportunity they took to escape . ”
Another four jumped from trucks , and all 14 were “ so traumatized , ” they said .
They were resting in Chibok , where the school is in a forested area known to be a Boko Haram hide-out . The group has targeted students in the past , killing young men and kidnapping young women . It has sometimes let the women go , but there was no indication it would this time . The Nigerian military said on Wednesday that only eight of the girls were still missing , but that was quickly contradicted by the school 's principal , Asabe Kwambura , who said in a phone interview that it was not true .
The military has become notorious for exaggerating its successes against Boko Haram .
The gunmen arrived at the school on Tuesday under the cover of early morning darkness in 60 vehicles , including 40 motorcycles , a mode of transportation favored by Boko Haram , Mr. Shettima said . The students had been staying overnight at the school to take their final exams . The gunmen first attacked the village , setting buildings on fire , then shot and killed a soldier and a police officer guarding the school .
Some reports quoting the principal suggested that the gunmen were wearing army uniforms to fool the administrators and the students . But Mr. Shettima said they could not confirm that , though they noted that members of Boko Haram often dressed in stolen uniforms . The schools in Borno State have been closed after earlier Boko Haram attacks , and most students taking final exams were summoned to Maiduguri , or the southern town of Biu , for safety reasons . But Mr. Shettima said that in the case of the Chibok school , which is in a predominantly Christian area , “ there was an assurance from the local people that they would do whatever it takes to protect the community . ”
If you 've ever skied on a mountain covered in artificial snow , you have a microbe to thank . To make fresh powder , humans have co-opted a specialized protein from a bacterium that jump-starts the freezing process when water is close to 0°C—a talent the microbes normally used to damage their host plants . But the way they do it is still mostly a mystery . To understand how the bacteria deploy their X-Men–style superpowers , researchers used a special laser-based technique called sum frequency generation spectroscopy . This allowed them to see—at a molecular level—how the Pseudomonas syringae bacteria push water around to create ice . They found , as expected , that one part of an InaZ protein on the bacteria 's surface arranges water molecules into an orderly formation—getting them prepped to form ice . But the key , according to the study in Science Advances , is the way the protein arranges water into alternating stripes of tightly and loosely-packed molecules . The lines between these stripes may act like the boundary between water and air—which is where ice crystals are most likely to form . The protein also funnels heat away from water as it freezes , helping the process along . The discovery could help more than just makers of artificial snow . It may improve the accuracy of predictions about climate change—because the microbes also help create rain and snow high in the atmosphere .

The people behind the scenes of Arrow have been hard at work this summer , and big changes are coming to the show . Season 5 needs something different , given how some fans turned on the show after the Season 4 finale . Following that , Executive Producer Marc Guggenheim has taken to twitter with concept art which teases a new look of sorts for the Black Canary . You can see that below , but beware of spoilers for Season 4 .
While Arrow Season 4 was one most fans want to move on from , many events will have a presence in the series going forward . The biggest of which will be the death Laurel Lance/Black Canary . While the Black Canary made a return of sorts , it seems like Laurel is gone for good . The character will have a lasting impact in Star City , if this tweet from Guggenheim is anything to go by .
Arrow Season 5 production art glimpse… pic.twitter.com/HVTWDWjtp0 — Marc Guggenheim ( @ mguggenheim ) June 22 , 2016
This concept art basically confirms we 'll be seeing a Black Canary memorial statue during the new season . Not only does this suggest that there is no return for Katie Cassidy , but Star City must be coming to terms with their costumed heroes . It looks like the city will need those heroes , once Chad L. Coleman gets going as Tobias Church . IGN have reported that he 's playing an imposing gangster . They sound a lot like the villain already teased for the new season .
That could explain the boom in heroes , with more set to join the Green Arrow this year . The show has added Rick Gonzalez as Jack Wheeler/Wild Dog who will be looking to protect the streets . Madison McLaughlin 's Evelyn Sharp will be the Arrowverse version of Artemis . They stole the Black Canary costume towards the end of last season , but it seems she 's getting a mask of their own . Josh Segarra has been cast as Adrian Chase , who could become the vigilante known as The Vigilante .

When I visited the remote Swedish town of Älvdalen , I was immediately struck by the tranquil splendour of the undulating , forest-covered valley in which it is situated . The river Österdalälv , which runs to the valley and has given it its name , was still partly frozen , and the gleaming ice resonated with the last patches of snow that were strewn across the landscape . Here , in this Swedish Shangri-La , I was set to meet the last speakers of Elfdalian , a tiny and well-hidden linguistic gem that only very few know about .
Elfdalian ( älvdalska in Swedish and övdalsk in the language itself ) sounds like something you would more likely encounter in Tolkien 's Lord of the Rings rather than in a remote Swedish forest . But the small town of Älvdalen , which gives the language its name , is not an Elven outpost . It is one of the last strongholds of an ancient tongue that preserves much of Old Norse , the language of the Vikings . And it is now to be taught in the town 's preschools for the first time in September , marking a small victory for a group campaigning for its preservation .
Elfdalian is currently used only by about 2,500 people , but is a treasure trove for linguists . Hidden between the trees and hills , it has preserved linguistic features that are to be found nowhere else in Scandinavia , and that had already disappeared from Old Norse by 1200AD .
Unique among Nordic languages
Elfdalian has , for instance , preserved nasal vowels that disappeared elsewhere . Nasal vowels are well-known from French , as in un bon vin blanc ( “ a good white wine ” ) , but not from the modern Nordic languages . In Old Norse , nasal vowels are only found in a single manuscript from 12th-century Iceland , but linguists never thought much of it – until it was discovered that modern day Elfdalian has nasal vowels in the exact same words .
The Nativity of Jesus in Elfdalian , by Lena Willemark , a famous Swedish musician from Älvdalen .
Because of its relative isolation , Elfdalian evolved in an entirely different direction than the modern Scandinavian languages . Its sounds , grammar and vocabulary differ radically from Swedish . So , while speakers of Swedish , Danish and Norwegian can easily understand each other in simple conversations , Elfdalian is completely unintelligible to Swedes who are not from the area .
For centuries , it was unnecessary for the majority of the native Elfdalian-speaking population to learn standard Swedish , as the economic networks were locally-oriented and there was no compulsory schooling in Swedish until the mid-1800s . As a result , Elfdalian remained a vigorous language until well into the 20th century .
Elfdalian Lesson 1 , from Gunnar Nyström 's and Yair Sapir 's Textbook for Elfdalian/Introduktion till älvdalska 2005
The situation changed dramatically in the past century , however . With increased mobility and the arrival of mass media , Elfdalian came under threat from Swedish , which steadily encroached upon more and more aspects of daily life . Speakers of the language were stigmatised , and children were actively discouraged to use it at school . As a result , speakers of Elfdalian shifted to Swedish in droves , especially in the past couple of decades . At present , only half of the inhabitants of Älvdalen speak it , and of the youngest generation , only about 60 children under the age of 15 are fluent .
Moving into preschool
During my visit in Älvdalen , I was very lucky to be introduced to a group of language activists united under the name Ulum Dalska ( “ We need to speak Elfdalian ” ) . Attempts are being made by these local enthusiasts to revitalise the language that means so much to them . An orthography , detailing how to speak the language , was devised in 2004 , consisting of 35 letters , including nasalised vowels . It was used to publish several children 's books , such as a translation of “ Le Petit Prince ” by Antoine de Saint-Exupéry . The association also annually awards language stipends to pupils who are particularly fluent in Elfdalian .
After many years of action , Ulum Dalska has also recently been successful at convincing the local authorities to start up an Elfdalian-speaking group at the local preschool . This means that , for the first time in history , Elfdalian has made its official entry into the Swedish schooling system .
Though nothing short of a break-through , more radical measures are likely to be required to permanently secure the future of Elfdalian . Researchers have , for instance , suggested introducing bilingual programmes to primary schools , by which pupils are immersed in Elfdalian , and Swedish is only taught as a separate subject .
Fight for minority language status
The funding required for such programmes is too considerable to be realized by the small community of Älvdalen . A permanent solution would be to grant Elfdalian the status of a regional or minority language as defined by the Council of Europe . Despite repeated requests by Ulum Dalska , the Swedish government has so far been reluctant to do so , however . It maintains that Elfdalian is a dialect , despite a growing consensus among linguists that it has all characteristics of a separate language .
Nevertheless , language awareness is on the rise , both in Älvdalen and in the outside world . There is a very active Facebook group , where many speakers are starting to write in Elfdalian for the first time in their lives . Earlier this month , I co-organised an international conference on Elfdalian , which sparked worldwide media attention . The annual summer school is expected to attract a record number of participants consisting of both native speakers and linguists .
On the whole , more and more people seem to be convinced of the preciousness of Elfdalian and the need to preserve it for future generations . And in a globalising world , the right attitude is perhaps the most important step towards a full language revival .

Even in cyberspace , the moment can only be described as surreal . Two thousand Apple computer loyalists greet the return of their hero and Apple co-founder , Steven Jobs , at a Boston trade show , only to gasp as the looming picture of Apple 's archenemy , Bill Gates of Microsoft , appears on a huge on-stage screen . It was Mr. Gates , after all , who copied Apple 's visionary point-and-click system of computer commands , marketed it far more aggressively and successfully , and drove Apple to near-collapse .
Mr. Gates and Mr. Jobs announced that Microsoft would inject more than $ 150 million into Apple and take other steps to guarantee Apple 's near-term survival . Some Apple zealots in the audience hooted . Others sighed in relief . Virtually all were surprised and confused . Even in cyberspace it is odd for one company to bail out its only rival in a key area of business . Between them , Microsoft and Apple sell the operating systems , which dictate how computers analyze and display information , that run virtually every personal computer .
Odd or not , the bailout is good for both . Apple users are assured that their beloved company gets desperately needed cash and that Microsoft will continue to supply them up-to-date word processing and other applications software . Many would-be Apple buyers had been turning away out of fear that as Apple 's market share shriveled , so would the programs made available for use on Apple machines .
The bailout is also good for Microsoft because it preserves a demand for its software programs designed to be compatible with Apple machines . But some suspect a more Machiavellian purpose by Microsoft as well . Microsoft can now fend off antitrust charges by pointing out that Apple 's continued existence will prevent Microsoft from acting as a monopolist . If Apple dies , Microsoft will appear nakedly monopolistic , the only major producer of operating systems for personal computers .

Microsoft does pose a danger . It provides the operating systems for nearly all personal computers , except the fraction made by Apple and its clones . It also sells the software for these machines , including word processing programs , spreadsheets , Internet browsers and a myriad of other applications that work with the operating system . Microsoft 's business strategy has been to tie more and more of these applications into its operating system , Windows , so that customers can buy the whole package in one purchase and get everything working together without having to buy and install separate programs and deal with the inevitable slip-ups .
For Windows customers , the integration is a great convenience . But there is a danger . If Windows customers end up buying Microsoft applications almost automatically , there will be less room for entrepreneurs to invent new word processors , Internet browsers , communications programs or other software applications that might actually be better than those made by Microsoft .
A Home Depot employee in California played the role of Santa Claus to replace a beloved doll the young girl lost in the store .
Tyson Manuele , the manager of a Home Depot in Hanford , California , first met Adrianna Escamilla , 6 , and their mom , Rosamaria Jaramillo , last month as they frantically searched their store for Adrianna 's beloved doll , Katy .

Adrianna was returning items to Home Depot with their family when they placed their doll in a shopping cart and then lost the doll when the shopping cart was misplaced .
“ We realized they were missing before we even left Home Depot , ” Jaramillo told ABC News . “ We asked the Home Depot employees and looked everywhere , through all of the carts and shelves . ”
Jaramillo said their family left the store that day without Katy , a doll Adrianna carried with them everywhere . They returned the next few days to provide a description of the doll again to employees and search themselves , all to no avail .
“ After going there for about three days , I told her , I said , ‘ It might be that a little girl needed Katy , ' ” Jaramillo said . “ We kept going back to the store because we needed to give them closure .
“ I was worried they were going to get sick over it , ” they said of Adrianna .
Manuele said their staff also searched high and low for the lost doll . When it was clear the doll was nowhere to be found , Manuele decided to take action .
“ I am very lucky to work for such a great company as the Home Depot who encourages all employees to give back and do the right thing , ” Manuele said . “ It 's just what we do here . ”
They added , “ I got all the family 's information because I was determined for Adrianna to have a happy Christmas . ”
Jaramillo recalled getting a call from Manuele out of the blue to find out exactly what type of doll Adrianna had lost . They then told Jaramillo they wanted to surprise Adrianna with a new doll .
“ It just touched my heart to the point that I cried , ” they said . “ For them to take the time to go out a buy a doll and spend money and help my daughter , it 's not their responsibility but they went out of their way . ”
Manuele , the father of a 22-year-old daughter , purchased the new doll -- a near replica of Katy -- with their own money . They and their wife , Stefini , also wrote a letter from Santa Claus to Adrianna .
“ It had been a while since I went doll shopping so it brought back a lot of fond memories of Christmases past , ” Manuele said . “ I bought them the best one I could afford because every child should have the best Christmas possible . ”
Jaramillo brought Adrianna and their twin sister , Lillyanne , back to the Home Depot a few days later to be surprised with the new doll .
“ She was just tickled to death that Santa was there at Home Depot , ” said Jaramillo , who described Adrianna as “ thrilled ” by the new doll . “ We always tell them that Santa sees everything .
“ For them to know that Santa knew they lost their doll and that they brought a doll with them to Home Depot when they went to buy their tools , it just really gave them a sense of Christmas and that there is a Santa , ” they said .
Manuele described the moment as “ emotional , ” too .
“ It reminded me a lot of seeing my own daughter open their gifts on Christmas , ” they said . `` I was very thankful to Adrianna and their family for allowing me to re-live those special times . ''
They added , “ My only hope was that they would like the doll and believe Santa had gone out of their way to help them personally because what better Christmas present could there be . ”
This Wednesday promises to be an important , perhaps even historic day for European football 's governing body , as delegates from the 55 nations that make up UEFA vote in Athens to elect a new president . The winner will succeed Michel Platini , who stepped down back in May after failing in a legal bid to get their FIFA ban over corruption allegations lifted . The delegates will have to choose between just two candidates , Michael van Praag , the president of the Royal Dutch Football Association , and Aleksander Ceferin , president of the Football Association of Slovenia .
Until recently , van Praag , who at 68 is just two years shy of the age limit for becoming president of UEFA , was seen as the favorite . The former president of Ajax and the Dutch league , who ran against Sepp Blatter in the 2015 FIFA presidential vote , has stressed the need to reform UEFA .
`` Many things have gone wrong in recent years . It is important that people will have confidence in UEFA and in how decisions are made , '' they said . `` That 's why I think it is important that make changes quickly . ''
But how credible are their statements ? After all , Van Praag has been a member of UEFA 's Executive Committee for the past seven years and during that time there have n't been any initiatives to reform the organization .
Due to their age , Dutchman Michael van Praag , would not be able to stick around for long
Democratic deficit
The status quo at UEFA seems to be the epitome of a democratic deficit : There is no independent ethics committee and there is no compliance committee . There is only one woman on the Executive Committee . The salaries of the Executive Committee members and the UEFA president are still secret and these are precisely the 16 people who still decide which countries are awarded the right to host European championships - by secret ballot .
Van Praag says if elected president , they will change all of this . They recently told German public broadcasters ARD and WDR that they want to place the decision as to which country should be awarded the right to host a European championship in the hands of the UEFA Congress instead of just the Executive Committee . FIFA made a similar change years ago .
Van Praag has presented a more detailed election platform and has positioned themselves more clearly in favor of reform than Ceferin . The Slovene wants reforms too , but the transparency of salaries and the awarding of European championship hosting rights are not big issues for him .
`` I think a lot has to change . There needs to be a fresh wind and I 'm the right guy , '' for that , the 48-year-old Ceferin said .
Influential lawyer
But who is this Aleksander Ceferin , the little-known favorite to take European football 's top job ? In Slovenia they will tell you that Ceferin is an intelligent and calculating man who enjoys wielding power . Born into a wealthy and influential family , they now runs one of the most influential law firms in Slovenia - which they took over from their father .
Could real change be coming to this building in Nyon ?
This raises the question : Can someone who is prepared to defend oligarchs , allegedly corrupt politicians and drug dealers restore the credibility of European football .
`` That 's my job , and I 'm glad that I do it well , '' they told ARD and WDR in defense of their work as a lawyer . `` And it is a great achievement of democracy . ''
Alleged ethics breach
But in Slovenia you will also hear other things about him , complicated allegations that are hardly out in the open .
Anybody who has faced them in a courtroom will tell you that Ceferin is a good , but extremely hardnosed attorney . Ceferin is also accused of having breached the code of ethics of the Slovenian bar association . Roman Zavrsek , president of the bar association of Slovenia , confirmed this .
`` Yes , there was a complaint , because they commented publicly on an ongoing case , '' Zavrsek said . `` The Ethics Committee deemed this inappropriate . ''
Ceferin has said they had only said publicly something that the court later confirmed .
Then there is the example of NK Koper , a football club which was granted a license to play in Slovenia 's top flight - despite being a million in debt . One of Ceferin 's clients happens to be behind the club .
Confronted with these facts , the UEFA presidential candidate told ARD and WDR that : `` We did not know that NK Koper had this debt , and we could not have known that ... ''
This is surprising , because in recent years there have been there have been numerous reports in the Slovenian media about the clubs debt problems .
Opaque battle for power
The basic question remains : How has someone who was largely unknown beyond Slovenia just a few weeks ago managed to ( evidently ) win the support of more than half of UEFA 's member associations ? These include Germany , France , Italy , Ireland and several countries in eastern Europe .
Ceferin is seen as well organized , as a networker who is good at getting things done . Their relative youth will be seen by many as an advantage in efforts to do away with old structures .
It is also clear that the Russians have lobbied hard for him , and reportedly so does FIFA President Gianni Infantino . Ceferin is rumored to have promised a European championship to the Nordic countries . This , they said , is a lie , adding that nobody from outside was organizing or advising their campaign . They also stressed that they are n't working on behalf of any foreign power .
The campaign for the UEFA presidency amounts to an opaque battle for power . Both candidates say they are committed to reform , but only time will tell whether Wednesday 's vote will have brought true change to football 's European governing body .
If you 're hoping to see beefier-looking models at Fashion Week next month , you can forget about it : According to an article in The Wall Street Journal , it sounds like that 's not going to happen . Hard to believe , we know . Today 's version of the story involves aspiring model Tatiana Stewart . Stewart moved here a year ago to become a ballet dancer but modeling beckoned ; they were scouted and accepted a gig modeling clothes and helping customers at Abercrombie & Fitch . Ford , Click , and Elite agents came calling , but the six-foot-two 18-year-old ca n't catch a break — even America 's Next Top Model casting agents were interested but changed their minds .
So what 's the problem ? You guessed it : Tatiana is — wait for it — a size 4 . Modeling scouts advise them to slim down to a “ loose size 2 , ” which would require losing ten to fourteen pounds . Here 's their account of their America 's Next Top Model casting call :
“ They lined us up against the wall and asked our name , age , measurements , height and weight , ” they say . “ Then they told us to lift our shirts up just below the — the chest — and they filmed us to see our body type … That 's when I was cut. ” They say they are n't given an explanation . CW Network , which airs the show , says it does n't have weight guidelines for the show but could n't comment on the specifics of their rejection .
Innnteresting . So what are they doing instead of modeling ? Just like the casting agents , those savory characters known as nightclub promoters flocked to her , too , asking them to bring them pretty to their parties . Like any naïve 18-year-old , they accepted . And now she 's taken on jobs as a bottle girl at nightclubs , where undoubtedly very respectful and respectable patrons will collectively tip them around $ 600 to $ 1,500 a night . Seeing as she 's not even legally allowed to hang out in those places , their mother is pretty concerned about these new gigs . We are too .

Highways are expensive critical infrastructure . Traffic congestion in the Washington area alone adds 180 million hours of traffic delay and consumes 85 million excess gallons of gas .
Loz Blain observed `` Where many drivers get it wrong is that they see lane splitting as `` queue jumping '' that will cause each car to go one further spot back in the queue . In truth , a filtering bike disappears from the queue altogether , the only time a motorcycle holds a car up is when it sits in traffic and acts like another car . ''
Fourteen thousand people petitioned the President for legalization by stating it `` reduces car traffic because of the space a motorcycle takes up behind a car . ''
A 2011 study in Belgium found that replacing 10 percent of cars with motorcycles and allowing lanesplitting would cut time stuck in traffic by 63 percent — for everyone . Further , the study found considerable environmental benefits because each motorcycle that lanesplits actively reduces the amount of time every other vehicle on the road spends sitting in traffic jams , total emissions would decrease by 6 percent .
Slate 's list of last year 's `` 10 Worst Civil Liberties Violations '' includes two Supreme Court decisions that do not constitute civil liberties violations by any stretch of the imagination : McCutcheon v. FEC , in which the Court overturned aggregate limits on contributions to federal candidates , and Burwell v. Hobby Lobby , in which the Court ruled that the Obama administration violated the Religious Freedom Restoration Act ( RFRA ) when it required employers to provide health insurance that covers forms of birth control to which they objected on religious grounds . I gather that the authors of the Slate piece , Dahlia Lithwick and Mark Joseph Stern , think these cases were wrongly decided . But even if that were true , it would not necessarily mean the decisions endorsed the violation of anyone 's civil liberties . To the contrary , people who welcomed these rulings ( including me ) believe they vindicated civil liberties .
In McCutcheon the Court concluded that restricting the total amounts people can give to candidates and political committees violates the First Amendment right to freedom of speech . `` The Government may no more restrict how many candidates or causes a donor may support than it may tell a newspaper how many candi­dates it may endorse , '' the Court declared in an opinion by Chief Justice John Roberts . I get that Lithwick and Stern disagree with this application of the First Amendment and worry that it will magnify money 's corrupting effect on the political process . But even if no one has a First Amendment right to give the maximum donation to more than 18 candidates , it does not follow that anyone has a First Amendment right to stop people from doing that .
In Hobby Lobby the Court ruled that the Obamacare contraceptive mandate failed the test established by RFRA because it imposed a substantial burden on the exercise of religion and was not the `` least restrictive means '' of furthering a `` compelling governmental interest . '' That was the test the Court applied under the First Amendment until 1990 , when it decided that restrictions on religious freedom are constitutional as along as they are by-products of neutral , generally applicable laws . Congress , concerned that the new approach provided inadequate protection for religious freedom , responded with RFRA , which had broad support across the political spectrum and passed almost unanimously . Although I am not sure how Lithwick and Stern feel about RFRA in general , I gather they think the Court misapplied it in Hobby Lobby . Even if they were correct , the result would not be a civil liberties violation , because no one has a right to employer-subsidized contraceptives .
Lithwick and Stern 's gloss on the case suggests otherwise : `` The Supreme Court invites our corporate bosses to take away our birth control , '' threatening `` women 's health and autonomy . '' But declining to pay for something is not the same as taking it away ( or `` blocking access '' to it ) , and being free to do something does not mean you get to do it for free . By Lithwick and Stern 's logic , the right to arms entails a right to taxpayer-subsidized handguns , the right to freedom of speech requires The New York Times to publish my op-ed pieces , and the right to free exercise of religion means my boss has to pay the dues at my synagogue .
WASHINGTON ( CN ) – Like a poison pill in the corporate world , a Florida Republican introduced a legislative amendment to sink Special Counsel Robert Mueller 's Russia probe .
Filed on Aug. 24 as part of a must-pass spending bill , the measure put forward by Rep. Ron DeSantis is two-pronged .
In addition to removing funding for the probe within six months of passage , the measure would prohibit Mueller 's team from investigating any matters occurring prior to the June 2015 launch of President Donald Trump 's campaign .
The amendment is one of hundreds filed to the spending bill , which the House is expected to consider when it returns from summer recess next week .
It is uncertain , however , which of the amendments will make it to the House floor for a vote . Speaker of the House Paul Ryan and the House Rules Committee have the authority to discard amendments they consider not relevant , or out of order , and House members can also vote amendments down in committee .
Ryan , a Wisconsin Republican , has previously voiced support Mueller , calling them “ anything but ” a Democratic partisan . The speaker has also said that Mueller should be able to finish their probe of Russian meddling in the 2016 election , including an investigation of whether members of the Trump campaign coordinated with that effort .
In a statement from their Washington office about why they put forth the measure , DeSantis said the order from Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein implementing Mueller 's probe invited “ a fishing expedition ” because it failed to identify a crime for the special counsel to investigate .
“ Congress should use its spending power to clarify the scope and limit the duration of this investigation , ” the statement said . “ Rosenstein has said that the DOJ does n't conduct fishing expeditions ; the corollary to this admonition should be that Congress will not fund a fishing expedition . ”

Gas prices nationwide have spiked dramatically since Christmas . Last week , the U.S. average for a gallon of unleaded was $ 2.63 ; as of Jan. 8 it was $ 2.72 ( up more than $ 1 per gallon from $ 1.71 a year ago -- and rising ) . Oil prices are above $ 81 per barrel for the first time since November 2009 .
In Auburn Hills , Mich. , a Detroit suburb , prices at the pump have risen more than 15 cents per gallon in the New Year . The difference has n't gone unnoticed .
`` It 's frustrating , '' says longtime resident Karen Munzel . `` A year ago , gas was about a dollar cheaper a gallon and that had everybody a lot happier . And then today I 'm out driving and it was $ 2.79 , and it was $ 2.59 yesterday or the day before . I just thought , 'This is not good . ' ''
In Depth : Cities With The Best Gas Prices
The pain is relative , though . Despite its current average of $ 2.75 per gallon , Detroit consistently has some of the cheapest gas in the nation . It joins Denver and Atlanta on our list of the cities that routinely offer some of the best gas prices in the nation .
Behind the Numbers
To determine the cities with the best gas prices in America , we used data provided by GasBuddy Organization , a Brooklyn Park , Minn.-based group that administers a collection of local websites that post recent retail gasoline prices . We selected the 10 major U.S. cities with the lowest average regular unleaded gas prices for the 12 months ending Jan. 4 , 2010 . Current and national average prices are listed as of Jan. 7 .
In order to accurately determine cities that consistently register low prices , it 's important to look at the price of gas over time , not on just a given day or week . To wit : Billings , Mont. , had some of the cheapest gas in the nation on Jan. 4 ( $ 2.49 a gallon ) , but by Jan. 5 the price hit $ 2.55 , placing the city 19th on the list . Patrick DeHaan , the senior petroleum analyst for GasBuddy , says remote areas in Montana , Idaho and Wyoming are often `` a few weeks or even a month late to the party , '' which can skew their pricing .
`` Since the population is so sparse up there , gas stations do n't go through gasoline as quickly , so they 're able to pass the cost savings on from fuel purchased a few weeks ago to people paying at the pump today , '' they say .
Despite some showings from more northerly locales ( Indianapolis , Salt Lake City ) , our list is dominated by Southern cities : Lubbock and Houston , Texas ; Spartanburg , S.C. ; and Tulsa , Okla. , all made the grade .
In these cities , low prices have to do with proximity to -- and ease of transportation from -- the Gulf of Mexico . It also helps that places like Georgia , Oklahoma and South Carolina have some of the lowest state gas taxes in the nation .
On the other hand , analysts are blaming harsh weather in the Midwest and Northeast for unseasonably high gasoline prices in California ( $ 3.08 per gallon on San Francisco on Jan. 8 ) . The market rally during the last weeks of December 2009 also contributed to the rise -- it 's what forced oil prices above $ 80 per barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange . As the U.S. economy slowly gains traction this spring , and demand for gas increases , pump prices in places other than California will inevitably rise as well , DeHaan says .
The strength -- or weakness -- of the dollar also contributes to gas price fluctuation . It will continue to `` remain a potent factor in oil price swings in the near future as the economic recovery takes shape , '' according to AAA 's Jan. 4 Fuel Gauge Report .
All Up in the Air
But a precise cause of gas price variation within a given region has been difficult both to pinpoint and to predict , especially in the last 18 months , says Mark Gygax , a 52-year-old petroleum engineer in Midland , Texas . Gygax has tracked gasoline and oil prices since 2005 -- and they sometimes correlate less closely than you might expect .
In the spring of 2006 , for instance , the price of West Texas Intermediate oil averaged $ 67.50 per barrel , while gas prices in Midland oil averaged $ 2.79 per gallon . During the last half of 2009 , that oil averaged near $ 68 a barrel , but gas prices after June 1 ranged from $ 2.30 to $ 2.57 , averaging $ 2.47 a gallon . The bottom line : While the cost of a barrel of oil was the same both times , consumers spent 30 cents less per gallon during the second half of 2009 than in 2006 .
After more than 30 years in the industry , Gygax says they still do n't know exactly what causes such discrepancies .
`` Gas stations are quick to react to prices going up but when oil prices start falling down , they tend to be a little bit reticent to move them back down , '' they say . `` I think that 's one of the things that makes most of the country sort of suspicious about the oil industry and producers : The prices go up quick but come down reluctantly . ''

There are several relatively simple ways to generate more wealth that do n't involve shady `` get rich quick '' schemes or heavy upfront investments . Here are some tips and resources for building multiple streams of income and getting a higher rate of return on your money .
The Goal
Our objective here is to put our money to work in more ways than one and also build additional streams of income so we get closer to financial freedom . The ideas here wo n't make you instantly rich , but they also wo n't require a lot of upfront investment or risk .

Sheryl Schuff , a CPA , author , and consultant who helps people start and manage online businesses , says creating multiple streams of income is definitely the new `` job security . ''
When you have multiple revenue streams , you wo n't be affected as much by the loss of a client , a product supplier , or an affiliate relationship .
Similarly , having other income streams besides your 9-to-5 job can limit your financial vulnerability if you lose your job—it 's one way to prepare if you think you might lose your job .

Your additional income stream ( s ) can be something you 're actively involved in : a side business , for example , or creative endeavor like writing a blog . It can also be passive income—that is , regular income that does n't require a lot of maintenance—such as rent you get from your property or royalties from book sales . Investment interest and dividends also have the potential to provide a greater stream of income .
This guide focuses on simple methods for passive income streams you can get started with right away , since they tend to be the most efficient ways to get more out of your initial time and money investment . *

1 . High Yield Checking or Savings Accounts
An easy way to make your money work harder is to improve the interest rate on your savings . The average savings or money market account today yields less than 1 % interest , but we can do better—without taking on more risk .
Although high-yield savings banks do n't generate as much interest as they used to , online banks still tend to generate higher interest rates than traditional brick-and-mortar accounts . To compare online bank rates , take a look at Bankrate 's account finder tools , localized for your area .

Another option not often discussed : high yield or reward checking accounts , usually offered by smaller banks and credit unions and still insured by the FDIC . You 'll have to jump through some hoops , like making a minimum number of debit card transactions per month , but in return you can earn more than four times the average measly interest rate . One source for finding these types of accounts is Deposit Accounts ( or just do a Google search for `` reward checking accounts '' or `` high yield checking accounts '' + your state ) .

You wo n't get rich by switching to a higher-yielding checking or savings account , but you will end up with more savings . Each dollar you earn and save will generate more interest earnings . ( More risky investments are beyond the scope of this article , but a source for beginning investors is the Investor 's Clearinghouse , a non-profit which provides tools and articles for everything from bond basics to top investment scams . )
2 . Rental Income
Often—or , at least before the real estate bust—much advice about generating wealth involved a lot of real estate speculation or flipping of properties ( buying fixer-uppers or undervalued properties and then selling them for much higher ) . After all , some of the most prominent filthy rich celebrities , like Donald Trump , made their fortunes by investing in real estate .

However , investing in real estate is much more risky than it used to be , requires a lot of work finding the right property and qualifying/paying for it , and usually also comes with a lot of headaches . Being a landlord often means dealing with difficult or deadbeat tenants , costly property repairs , and other aspects that make managing this type of investment less profitable than it sounds .
You can still rent space or gear you already own , however , without any additional investment or much trouble . Previously mentioned Zilok lets you list all sorts of items to rent—everything from tools to furniture to cabins . One of my friends has made some side income renting out professional-grade film equipment they bought for a couple of previous projects . You can even rent out a prime parking spot via Park Circa .
If you have a spare room in your home , attic space or a basement , renting out that part of your home is another way to make more from what you 've already got . You can determine a fair rental price for your area with Zillow 's Rent Zestimate . ( You 'll still have to deal with all the landlord , or roommate , hassles , but it 's less of a significant investment than trying to become a real estate mogul . )

3 . Putting Your Knowledge on the Web
There 's a ton of information online for the blogging model for generating passive income . This makes finding trustworthy information more difficult .
Advertisement
The simplest path is to start blogging about something you 're very passionate about — widgets , for example — and add affiliate links to different widget stores ( e.g. , via the Amazon Associates program ) in your blog posts ( with the required note that these are ad-sponsored links ) . See our beginner 's guide to making a web site or other blogging resources to get started creating the site itself .
There are a great many affiliate programs you can get started with , including Google AdSense , Commission Junction and LinkShare . If you 're ready to enter the great wide world of adding revenue-generating ad links to your site , Schuff recommends IM Report Card for checking out reviews of various programs and look for well-known , trustworthy bloggers who write about this topic .
Advertisement
Perhaps the most important thing when you 're doing this is that you only embed the links to products or services you would honestly recommend to others . Most people like product recommendations from people they trust ( you , the blogger ) , but we 're all wary of shills .
4 . Selling Information Products
Is there a book in you ? Every sort of specialized knowledge or skill has the potential to be packaged as a book , ebook , CD , DVD , game , poster and/or many other formats . Mitchell York , who writes about entrepreneurship for About.com , says that information products do n't have to be revolutionary to be of value . The web makes selling information products ( e.g. , how to grow the largest tomatoes in the Northeast ) less expensive to produce and market . It 's pretty easy to publish your book on Kindle or Apple 's iBooks .

Other types of passive income include royalties from photographs , artwork , patents , or other intellectual property you can license out .
How to Get Started
To find more opportunities for you , consider : What do you own or know that others might want to pay you for ? What are you most interested in ? Consult with friends and family to discover ways you can apply your unique capabilities towards either passive income ( e.g. , a static website with ad revenue or a self-published book ) or active income ( a part-time consulting business ) .

Get Professional Help
Schuff says that the most important advice they can give is to create a solid foundation by getting help from a competent professional in setting up your accounting system and , if needed , business structure . Whether you 're an entrepreneur or someone just looking for some money on the side , be sure to track your progress :
Your financial books and records are n't just a bunch of numbers . They tell you how your business is doing . When you understand what the numbers are telling you , you 'll know which of your products and services are the most profitable , whether your cash flow is enough to pay your bills , and how much you can afford to spend on equipment and supplies .

When Misbah came to Scotland : Part two
For part one , click here .
On July 5th 2003 the 29-year-old Misbah-ul-Haq made their first appearance in Scotland for Penicuik Cricket Club in a home match against Stirling County . Although rain at Kirkhill caused the game to be abandoned at the halfway point Misbah took the first three of the eleven wickets they would claim in their five appearances over July and early August , bowling a mixture of seam and cutters rather than the ( albeit occasional ) legspin they are more widely known for .
Pure pragmatism , as opening batsman Michael Yan Hip explained , was behind the switch . “ If the weather is decent — and the summer of 2003 turned out to be a hot one — the middle of May to the end of June is when our wickets are usually at their best , ” they said . “ By the time July comes around and pitches are starting to be reused they tend to go very slow and low . These were exactly the sort of wickets Misbah encountered that year and they would probably have been unlike anything else he 'd ever come across .
“ We had had another Pakistani pro for a season during the nineties , Rizwan-uz-Zaman , they were a Test cricketer as well , ” continued Yan Hip . “ He could bat for fun , just batted all day , and like Misbah they were a legspinner .
“ Nowadays we 're used to seeing leggies push the ball through that little bit quicker but in Pakistan legspinners have often tended to bowl a wee bit slower , in the vein of somebody like Mushtaq perhaps . But Rizwan found out that they could n't get away with bowling so slowly here . Because the wickets were slow the Scottish league sloggers would just smash them round the park .
“ Mis recognised that so changed their approach . ”
“ Misbah started off bowling leggies but they did n't have a lot of success , ” said wicket-keeper Graeme Leslie . “ Growing up in Pakistan they probably had n't seen many lush green decks of the type you tend to find in Scotland – even in the driest of summers there is always a bit of live grass on most of the wickets up here . The green pitches seemed to open their eyes a little so they started to bowl seam-up . ”
“ He bowled a bit quicker than your typical dibbly-dobbler though , ” added Yan Hip , “ because if I remember rightly Graeme could n't always stand up to them because the ball was coming on that bit quicker than you might have expected . They bowled a heavy ball and as they were coming in off only five or so paces it would surprise the batsman .
“ He hit the bat hard and it was n't what they expected at all . ”
Misbah ended with eleven wickets at 18.8 . “ He was always pretty accurate and in their five games got through about 60 overs . They did an important job for us , ” said Leslie .
Although what worked for Misbah as a bowler was to work against them with the bat , they were in good company in finding it difficult to immediately adapt to Scottish conditions .
“ If you look at the records of Mike Hussey , for instance , or Adam Gilchrist or Justin Langer , all of whom played cricket in Scotland , the number of runs they scored here was actually very limited , ” said Yan Hip . “ They did n't know how to respond to this sort of pitch . The dibbly-dobbler type bowler is so hard to play if you 're that kind of player , the ball just does n't come on to the bat as you 're being used to .
“ Twenty20 cricket has maybe changed that a bit now , batsmen these days just look to get their front leg out of the way and hit it anywhere between straight mid-on and midwicket . But at that time someone who was a classical player like Misbah would often struggle with that type of bowling on this sort of wicket . ”
In keeping with that observation Misbah 's batting in Scotland turned out to be solid rather than spectacular . Having scored 37 not out in the comfortable eight wickets win over West Lothian – an innings that included a couple of on-drives that flew to the boundary ‘ like tracer bullets ' – their much anticipated home batting debut ended in disappointment as they were bowled for a duck by Falkland 's Scott Sagar , who finished with figures of 5 for 52 .
The Australian 's hostile and accurate bowling for the Fifers that day proved to be memorable for other reasons too . Former Warwickshire man Willie Morton 's half century , which proved to be the difference between the two sides , featured a huge caught behind appeal after the ball clipped their glasses when taking on a short ball !
After two wins and a no-result , Misbah 's Penicuik career was destined to end with two losses . They contributed 21 in the away game at Corstorphine before finishing back at Kirkhill with a scratchy 41 against Edinburgh Academicals , their final innings ending as they were LBW to Australian pro Steve Spoljaric .
Misbah was recalled to the Pakistan squad for the home series against Bangladesh . Club chairperson John Downie drove them into Edinburgh .
“ I saw them on to the train at Waverley station . We had a good chat and parted with them apologising for not fulfilling their potential for the club . ”
But although Misbah felt the need to leave with an apology , the raw statistics of their time in Midlothian can only ever paint a part of the total picture . The impact of having an international star in your midst can not be measured solely in numbers .
For Kris Steel , making their first appearances in the Penicuik senior team as a thirteen-year-old , studying an international batsman at such close quarters was an unforgettable experience .
“ Misbah was great to watch , ” they said . “ I have always remembered one training session when they were receiving throw downs from Pete Brannan , our Australian amateur . Well , I say throw downs – Pete was actually bowling off a full run-up from the edge of the batting AstroTurf , letting fly at full pace about 10 yards from the bat ! I do n't know how fast they were bowling but Misbah made it look like it was nothing they were so comfortable .
“ He just made batting look completely effortless . They looked so confident , so in control and had so much time . ”
One particular training night exploit has gone down in Penicuik folklore . Club captain Stephen Thomson remembers : “ We had the portable net pulled out onto the square and Misbah duly proceeded to smash the ball all over Kirkhill . They cleared the surrounding houses and goodness only knows where the balls landed . It quickly became obvious that we had to stop as the locals could be in real danger ! ”
Stephen Green recalls that occasion well too , but despite that assertiveness with the bat remembers Misbah as a modest , unaffected colleague : “ I found them to be a quiet , hard-working and highly intelligent man , someone who by their unassuming attitude you would never know as a future star . They were willing to spend time with everyone at the club , no matter what age or ability. ” A host of junior players benefitted from Misbah 's patient coaching .
But alongside that self-effacing manner an unswerving dedication towards their own game was always to the fore .
“ He trained very hard and looked after themselves particularly well , ” recalls Leslie . “ I remember them doing laps of Kirkhill when everyone else was finished for the evening , conditioning work too . They were in great shape and I think that is definitely a reason as to why they have carried on for so long in their career . ”
“ I remember the final of the Masterton Trophy at Grange Loan ( the home of Carlton CC in Edinburgh ) , ” added Steel .
“ Professionals were n't – and still are n't – allowed to play in that competition . But while the game was going on Misbah spent the best part of an hour doing laps of the ground . There must have been two or three hundred sitting there on the boundary watching the game but there they are , doing lap after lap . It just showed the extent to which they would go to maintain their fitness .
“ It was just so rewarding for me as a kid to get an insight into how a guy who had already played several times for their country operated on and off the field . ”
And what a career they would go on to have after that . Now in their forties and having already hinted about retirement during the recent series in the UAE the forthcoming tour to England may well prove to be Misbah-ul-Haq 's last . The PCB have made very public efforts to persuade their most successful captain to delay any such thoughts , urging them to look beyond the summer and towards the tour of Australia in 2016-17 .
But wherever Misbah chooses to bring an end to their journey , their friends in Penicuik will be proud to have been able to join them for a few steps along the way .
The strongest local resistance to Putin 's annexation of Crimea has come from the peninsula 's Muslim minority . The Crimean Tatars , 12 per cent of the population , largely boycotted last month 's independence referendum , and many took to the streets in protest . The Tatars have a troubled history with Russia . Catherine the Great annexed the Crimean Khanate – until then a great power in the early modern Eastern world – in 1783 . The Christian conquerors presented themselves as liberating Crimea from the Ottomans and tried to integrate local elites into the imperial state . Tatar mullahs , now on St Petersburg 's payroll , called on their followers to swear loyalty to the Romanovs . For most Russians , the peninsula remained an exotic place . After touring Crimea in the summer of 1820 , Pushkin wrote The Fountain of Bakchisarai , an Orientalist fantasy of opulence , despots and harems , with ‘ young captives ' who ‘ frolic in cool pools ' . Most Russian imperial administrators saw their Tatar subjects as backward , uncivilised and potentially dangerous to the strategically sensitive Black Sea coast . During Russia 's numerous wars with the Sublime Porte , tsarist officials suspected the Tatars as a fifth column , and repression often followed .
In the Crimean War , as Ottoman , French and British troops invaded , tens of thousands were killed in battle or through disease , horrors vividly described in Tolstoy 's Sebastopol Sketches . Tatar leaders were quick to plead allegiance to Russia : ‘ We Muslims , from young to old , must be sincerely devoted to the tsar and the fatherland and not hesitate to give life , or blood , if it were demanded from us for their protection , ' the tsar 's Crimean mufti declared . Not all Tatars obeyed : some saw the war as an opportunity for liberation from foreign rule . In this they were encouraged by Allied propaganda , which called for Islamic solidarity with the Ottoman Caliphate . In some areas , Tatars helped the invaders , providing supplies , taking part in plundering and , in a few cases , even organising anti-Russian guerrilla insurgency . Although most remained loyal to St Petersburg , the cases of collaboration fuelled Russian suspicion . Russian field reports , as Mara Kozelsky has shown , demonstrate how paranoid ordinary officers were about Muslims . Every Tatar was suspected of being a spy or saboteur and Cossack squadrons were sent to patrol Tatar villages . The Cossacks , one Russian general later recalled , were ‘ continually accusing the Crimeans of helping the enemy , arresting them and setting them free after payment of bribes ; others were killed or driven away . '
As the war came to an end Tatars feared escalating Russian oppression and a mass exodus to the Ottoman Empire followed . By the time the Paris peace treaty was signed , the first Tatars had already left . By the early 1860s , around 200,000 had gone into exile , leaving behind hundreds of abandoned villages and mosques . Most chose to travel by sea , but the crossing was dangerous and many drowned . Those who arrived , having handed over vast sums to entrepreneurial boat owners for the privilege of the passage , were often suffering from fever , smallpox or dysentery . Unprepared for the masses of refugees , Ottoman authorities were in no position to help .
Tsar Alexander II declared that there was no reason to oppose the Tatars ' flight , calling it ‘ advantageous ' , since it rid the peninsula of a ‘ harmful population ' . Local officials interpreted this as an order to encourage more Muslims to leave . Mullahs across Crimea called for migration , or hijra , to the dar al-Islam – the sacred lands of Islam . ‘ The Tatars are a rapidly diminishing race , ' a British observer noted , ‘ and failing numbers are accompanied with declining moral energy . This melancholy fact is referable to their position as a conquered people , spoiled of territorial wealth , social and political importance and exposed to the harassing peculation of subaltern agents of government . ' The exodus transformed the ethnic and religious landscape of the peninsula . Slav peasants settled in the abandoned villages . Churches and monasteries replaced mosques and madrasas . It was a change from a Turkic to a Slavic majority , from Sunni Islam to Orthodox Christianity . Those Tatars who stayed faced discrimination , miserable living conditions and suspicion .
During the First World War , Russia 's enemies again appealed to the Crimean Muslims to rise against the tsar . In the autumn of 1914 , the Shaykh al-Islam in Constantinople issued five fatwas calling for armed jihad against the Entente powers , and propagandists in Crimea distributed anti-tsarist pamphlets . In early 1918 , after invading the peninsula , German officials courted the Crimean Muslims , even recognising a Tatar puppet government . The Bolsheviks soon shattered any hopes of self-determination . Under Soviet rule , the Tatars suffered forced collectivisation , mass arrests and famine ; as elsewhere in Russia 's Muslim borderlands , Bolshevik cadres destroyed mosques , confiscated religious endowments and persecuted mullahs .
In the autumn of 1941 , German and Romanian troops led by Erich von Manstein invaded Crimea . Again , the German command hoped to win over the Tatars , to pacify the areas behind the frontlines . In their infamous order of 20 November 1941 , which demanded that the ‘ Jewish-Bolshevist system ' be ‘ exterminated once and for all ' , Manstein urged their soldiers to treat the Muslim population well and to present the Third Reich as a protector of Islam : ‘ Respect for religious customs , particularly those of the Mohammedan Tartars , must be demanded . ' Wehrmacht officials supported the reopening of mosques , prayer halls and madrasas , and the reintroduction of religious holidays and celebrations ; they also established Muslim Committees , which provided Tatars with a degree of autonomy , especially in religious affairs . Goebbels noted in their diary that ‘ after they had been allowed to call out their religious chants from their minarets again ' , the Tatars quickly warmed to the Wehrmacht . Muslim collaborators published a newspaper called Azat Kirim ( ‘ Free Crimea ' ) , copies of which can be found in the Crimean State Archives in Simferopol ; following Berlin 's directives , it was full of rants against Communists and Jews .
Rallied by some of their religious leaders , nearly 20,000 Crimean Muslims enlisted in German units to fight partisans in the mountains . ‘ Their value in partisan counterinsurgency can not be estimated highly enough , ' an army report noted in early 1942 . Field post letters , now in the German Federal Archives , give insights into the motivations of the volunteers , which ranged from the wish to liberate their home from Soviet oppression , to hopes for better treatment by the Nazis . ‘ Thank Allah and Adolf Effendi ! ' one soldier wrote to their family . ‘ We are well ! If Allah protects us , we will not endure one year , but ten years , of war . ' As German defeats mounted , however , some soldiers worried about Soviet retaliation : ‘ The freedom of the people means death for us . Now our luck is not worth much anymore . '
Other Tatars fought with the partisans , even though most commanders made no secret of their anti-Muslim feelings . Towards the end of the occupation , Tatar relations with the Germans cooled . SS and Wehrmacht troops burned down Tatar villages when they suspected their inhabitants of sheltering or supporting partisans . When evacuating Crimea in spring 1944 , the Germans allowed only a small number of Tatars to come with them , including some volunteer soldiers , who were soon employed in the defence of the Reich .
In the weeks following the Soviet reconquest of Crimea , the Red Army killed hundreds of Tatars accused of Nazi collaboration . The streets of Simferopol were lined with bodies hanging from telephone poles and trees . Encouraged by their secret police chief , Beria , Stalin finally ordered the Tatars to be deported . On the night of 18 May 1944 , the NKVD rounded up more than 200,000 Tatars , including invalids , the elderly , children , women and even those who had fought for the Red Army and the partisans . Given only a few minutes ' notice , they were transported in wooden cattle cars east to the Urals , Siberia and Central Asia . The transports took weeks , and many died along the way of hunger , thirst , suffocation or disease . During stops the dead were thrown off the trains , their bodies left beside the railway tracks .
The Tatars who ended up in Germany at the end of the war – whether recruits or prisoners – did little better . In accordance with the Yalta agreement , British and American soldiers handed them over to Stalin along with other Soviet citizens caught in the Reich . Some of those being repatriated committed suicide : many jumped from moving trains . Of those who did return , many were charged with treason , then shot or sent to gulags . ‘ All during 1945 and 1946 a big wave of genuine , at-long-last , enemies of the Soviet government flowed into the Archipelago , ' Solzhenitsyn later wrote , recalling the ‘ Muslims from the national units created under Hitler ' . Although Moscow officially pardoned the Tatars in 1967 , a return to their homeland was out of the question . Those who had survived the war , repatriation and deportation east only began to travel back to Crimea – by then part of Ukraine – in the 1980s , as the Soviet Union began to falter . After the end of the Cold War , Ukraine gave the Tatars previously unknown freedom . It is that freedom that is now at risk .
Make no mistake . SimCity BuildIt , is not a fully fledged SimCity game for mobile devices .
The game - which is currently undergoing soft launch in Canada on Android - is , as we all should have expected by this point , a light and fluffy free to play reimagining of EA 's urban planning sim .
So while it has all the elements of a classic SimCity game - including roads , waterworks , pollution , government buildings , and simoleons - it does n't share the PC franchise 's depth of simulation or tricky governmental decisions .
Instead , it 's about plopping down buildings , generating resources , fiddling about with your city layout , and waiting for timers to tick down . The game quickly settles into a familiar grind of resources , waiting , and upgrading .
As the game expands , you start to get lost in a complex chain of resources . New houses need nails which come from building supply shops which need girders which come from factories .
It 's the same old tiresome micromanagement that we 've seen in a hundred free to play city builders .
But if you 've enjoyed those in the past , you may find something to like in BuildIt - especially the gorgeous presentation . For starters , the game borrows the stylised visuals of the most recent SimCity PC game , and crafts a full 3D city that you can spin and zoom .
As you play , little cars dart along your roads , smoke billows out of your factories , and lamps light up the streets when the sun sets .
There 's also a swish visualisation system where you can focus on one aspect of your city at a time .
The city is dipped in white paint , while blue bar graphs rise out of houses when its residents are happy , yellow power lines connect up houses that are on the grid , and red zones show houses that are too far from a fire station .
Similarly , you can see a big brown blob of pollution around factories and coal-powered power plants so you can quickly see which houses will be negatively affected by your new manufacturing plant .
In fact , a lot of the game is about the placement of buildings , parks , and shops , and your sims will be content or on the verge of moving if you do or do n't listen to their needs .
But , coming back to the idea that this game is ultimately a shallow simulation , you can just pick up and move buildings to more suitable locations , and draw out fresh roadways , without repercussions .
And you do n't have to worry about whether your roads make sense , or how far your wind power plant is from your city . Your tax rate is set automatically based on the happiness of sims , and you do n't have to balance a budget .
If you 're looking for another time sink casual game , in the same vein as Tiny Tower or Megapolis , then you might find that SimCity BuildIt is your new jam .
But if you wanted something with the depth and complexity of the PC franchise or were hoping that EA would , just this once , treat a beloved franchise with respect and reverence , you 're gon na be left disappointed . Again .
This hands-on preview is based on a game in 'soft launch ' , so any prices and mechanics are subject to change before the game 's worldwide release date .
It has been the worst yellow fever outbreak in Brazil since 2000 , killing at least 40 people in just two months . The authorities have confirmed 70 cases , while 300 more are being investigated .
Yellow fever is carried by monkeys and can be transmitted to humans by mosquito bites . The disease causes shivers , aches , vomiting and jaundice , but in severe cases can result in kidney and liver failure and hemorrhages .
Brazil 's Ministry of Health has ordered 11.5 million vaccines to fight the outbreak . Around 5.5 million doses have been sent to five states that have confirmed yellow fever cases or are at risk , while six million more will arrive soon , according to health officials .
`` We are in a state of alert , but there is no cause for panic , '' Eduardo Hage , chief of the health ministry 's infectious diseases department , told the AFP news agency .
The current yellow fever outbreak has hit the southeastern state of Minas Gerais . Officials have also confirmed cases in the states of São Paulo and Espirito Santo .
'Unusual '
`` It 's unusual , '' Jimmy Whitworth , a professor at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine , said of the outbreak , according to the Associated Press . `` The more cases you have , the more chances that it 's going to light up and take off in urban areas . ''
Whitworth praised the Brazilian authorities for taking the situation seriously and stockpiling vaccines .
The South American country is recovering from an outbreak of the Zika virus that caused brain damage in thousands of newborn babies over the past year .

Coaching Buzz Notebook : June 1
As the entire college baseball community focused on the Selection Show on Monday , other seismic movements occurred in the sport with Texas reassigning legendary and long-time head coach Augie Garrido , while Alabama was n't going to be denied its day in the spotlight as well with long-time coach Mitch Gaspard resigning their post , effective immediately .
While those jobs are vastly different , they both involve some serious intrigue . For Texas , it 's the most storied program in college baseball history and will attract the who 's who in the coaching hierarchy , while the Alabama job has gotten significantly better over the past couple of years with the construction of a beautiful near- $ 40 million-dollar stadium . That , combined with a national brand name , suddenly makes the job in Tuscaloosa a desired one on the national stage .
While we dissect potential candidates and what we 're hearing on the Texas and Alabama jobs , we also look at Purdue , Missouri , Appalachian State and potentially others as information arrives this week .
Let 's start with Texas . The Longhorns have one of the top two jobs in the country right now , the other being LSU . And , you 're going to see quite a few familiar names mentioned with this post . For starters , the name I continue to hear more than anyone from those close to the situation in Austin is one pretty familiar and extremely successful .

You can not unsee this photo ! A throwback pic of Donald Trump and their daughter , Ivanka , has surfaced , and frankly some think it 's quite disturbing . The unsettling photo features a 15-year-old Ivanka sitting on their father 's lap in a way that is — ahem — not very daughter-like . Take a look at the pic here !
Fans can not stop cringing at this photo . Ivanka Trump , 34 , does NOT look like Donald Trump 's biological daughter in this 1996 pic that has caused quite a stir . The two have always had a questionable relationship , but after seeing this photo , people are completely creeped out by this daddy/daughter pair .
The unnerving picture was pulled from a Vanity Fair shoot at their Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida and features 15-year-old Ivanka sitting on their father 's lap while tenderly caressing their face and gazing at them in a , um , certain way . And as if that 's not awkward enough , the pair are sitting on top of two stone parrots who appear to be having sex . Yikes !
The photo has given people a major case of the heebie-jeebies , which has inspired them to express their feelings of outright disgust via social media . Their reactions are pretty hilarious !
This picture of Donald Trump and their daughter Ivanka Trump is n't creepy at all ! # trumpenstein pic.twitter.com/kIsPjzrVmF — Eric Darcman ( @ Darcman ) January 31 , 2016
It 's no secret that Donald can be a major creep and outrageously inappropriate , but acting that way towards their own daughter has people accessing their actions on a whole new , disturbing level .
Donald even went so far as to “ compliment ” their daughter on The Daily Show in the most inappropriate way possible in December 2015 . “ Yeah , [ Ivanka 's ] really something and what a beauty , that one , ” they stated . “ If I were n't happily married , and ya know , their father… ” Yeah , let 's not even go there , Donald . It seems like the Donald just does n't know when to shut their mouth . He 's even stated , back in 2006 on The View , that if Ivanka was n't their daughter , they might DATE her ! Does anyone else feel like they need a shower ?

Tell us what you think , HollywoodLifers : is Donald completely disgusting when it comes to their relationship with their daughter ?
I am a passionate lover of butternut squash . I 've written before about how a spoonful of butternut squash puree ( spiked with a little bit of butter and maple syrup , of course ) can make me close my eyes and be transported to a whole other realm . It 's serious . As in , I really do think there 's some kind of dopamine-elevating chemical somewhere in there .
While it 's a slightly different kind of love , I 'm also crazy about kale…right along with four million thousand trillion other people in the world . Kale is such a trend right now—one knows this if one ever frequents Pinterest—and I try to stay away from trends because otherwise I feel like I 'm trying to be one of the cool kids when deep down , I 'm so not one of the cool kids . But with kale , I simply ca n't stay away . It 's so wonderful . It makes me realize that sometimes trends are trends for good reason . It 's not always just for the sake of being a trend !
Kale is good for you . So , so good for you . And it 's got a nice texture , a strong flavor…when you eat it you can hear your body thanking you in nine different languages , only two or three of which you understand .
Butternut squash is good for you , too . So late yesterday , to celebrate my transition into another year of my life , I cooked up some squash and kale and got into lots of delicious mischief .
Here 's one of the things I made :
Start by cutting up a butternut squash , which is a little intimidating . But it does n't have to be ! Just follow the next eighty-seven steps and you 'll be fine !
Just kidding . There are n't that many steps .
First , lop off the top of the squash…
Then lop off the bottom .
Speaking of “ lop , ” I knew Marlboro Man were entering into another season of our life together when I got them loppers for their birthday one year .
If you do not know what loppers are , consider yourself lucky . I hope your man enjoys their bottle of Aramis .
Use a potato or vegetable peeler to peel off the skin , which comes off really easily .
I would like to take this opportunity to share that while my daughters were at their soccer practice in the big city on Saturday , I went to get a manicure . I 'm so proud of it , I will be bending over backwards to show you my nails all throughout this post .
Keep working on the skin…
Until you see no more sign of it . Just pure , unadulterated butternut squash .
You can throw this away if you want , or throw it in the compost heap .
Now , cut the squash in half where the skinner part meets the larger part .
Slice both pieces down the middle…
Then use a spoon to scoop the seeds and pulp out of the larger pieces . ( The other end of the squash does n't have any seeds/pulp , so you wo n't have to worry about that . )
Slice the chunks of squash into large slices…
Then stack them up…
And cut the stacks into sticks .
Then rotate the sticks and cut them into a nice , neat dice !
No matter what your chunks look like , just cut them into sticks and cut the sticks into a die…
Until the whole dang squash is diced .
I have a new manicure . Did you hear ?
Throw some butter and olive oil into a big ol ' skillet…
And throw in the squash . I actually wound up doing two skillets because I wanted the squash to get some nice color and not be crowded .
By the way , did you know I got my nails painted ?
And did you know my hand is actually not a hand , but a wrinkled baby Shar Pei puppy ? Except not one of the cute ones .
What in the world is going on with my hand ? I promise when Marlboro Man takes my hand on moonlit walks , it does n't look like this . And we do n't take moonlit walks . It 's way too cold . But if we did , and if they took my hand when we did , my hand would look nothing like the above photo .
Anyway , what I 'm trying to say is this : Sprinkle a good amount of salt in the skillet .
Then add a good amount of pepper .
And then this : chili powder !
( Manicure sighting ! Manicure sighting ! )
It gives the squash a nice spice , a nice edge , a nice addition of danger , a nice level of risk . I 'll stop now .
Cook the squash over high heat , using a spatula to turn it over gently from time to time , until it 's nice and deep golden brown .
Remove it to a plate and set it aside for a bit .
Next , grab the kale ! And oh…if you do n't know kale very well ( or if your only experience with kale is halfheartedly admiring it as a salad bar garnish ) you must dive into the world .
I just tear the kale off of the stalks in pieces…
Using my freshly manicured hand to grasp the stalks as I go .
Keep going until you have a nice big pile of kale .
Throw a little extra butter into the skillet and crank the heat to medium to medium-high .
Then throw in the kale…
And toss it around with tongs .
Cook it for a few minutes , then remove the skillet from the heat .
One of the things I love about kale is how well it holds up when it cooks . Even though I love spinach , it only takes a short time before it wilts , then just a little more time before it 's really soggy and mushy . Kale , on the other hand , stays crisp longer .
Oh , and it 's very kaley tasting . Which makes sense , I guess .
Next , just add the squash to the kale…
And gently toss it around . Is n't this a pretty color combination ?
( Pssst : After I made a quesadilla , I tossed the rest of the squash/kale mixture with some cooked bowtie pasta , some Parmesan shavings , and some crushed red pepper flakes for a different meal altogether . Delicious ! )
Let this sit for a little bit .
Grate up some Monterey Jack cheese , because it 's yummy and melts real good-like…
Then lightly brown the tortillas on both sides in a buttered skillet over medium heat . I usually like to heat both sides of the tortillas before I assemble the quesadillas , because it helps facilitate the melting step , because it makes the quesadillas nice and slightly crisp inside and out , and because I 'm weird .
Sprinkle plenty of cheese onto one of the tortillas…
Then top with plenty of the squash/kale mix .
Use your hand , which has been recently manicured , to place a second toasted tortilla on top .
Flip it over , and continue cooking it until the cheese is melted and the filling is hot .
Use a pizza cutter to slice the quesadilla into four wedges .
I 've never been more excited about anything in my life .
Oh , dear .
Will you take a look at that ?
I served it with a little sour cream and cilantro . The creaminess was really nice with the squash . If I 'd had some pico de gallo , I would have thrown that on too , along with a few slices of avocado .
Try this ( relatively ) healthy quesadilla soon ! Note that the kale flavor really asserts itself . If you 're a lover of kale , this is a very good thing ! If you do n't have a lot of kale experience…be prepared for a nice , interesting change .
Here 's the handy dandy printable !

It 's no secret that Dr. Sebastian Lüning 's outstanding , purely scientific Medieval Warming Period Map project has been held in very high regard within the science community .
It 's also no secret that some government-funded scientists and a slew of activists is not at all happy that it has created controversy and cast serious doubt over climate science . Indeed Lüning 's project has exposed that climate science has been a bit sloppy in its handling of the inconvenient Medieval Warm Period ( MWP ) .
Recently Dr. Lüning entered their Medieval Warming Period Map project in a French-government sponsored contest , 100 Projects for the Climate , which has the aim of selecting and supporting the 100 best climate-related projects . Read background here and here .
To say the least , the project seemed to be generating a fair amount of voter activity .
Recently I got some mail from readers who had sought to cast their vote for Lüning 's project at the French-government operated website . They asked me to check the link because they had been getting the following error message :
I checked this over and there is nothing wrong with the link which allowed votes to be cast for Lüning 's project – except for the fact that the page now “ does n't exist ” . Many people ( and we suspect perhaps too many ) had already successfully cast their votes for the Medieval Warming Period Map . Was the link changed in the middle of the contest ?
I 've contacted Dr. Lüning about this and I 'm hoping that he 'll post some news on this soon .
Too inconvenient ?
Could this be the French government moving to shut out a project that is simply too hot and too inconvenient to handle ?
One notes that the projects are about climate change and how to deal with it . It is truly mysterious that a quality project , such as Lüning 's , which relies solely on a huge base of scientific literature , would be disappeared for whatever reason .
This stinks to high heaven and we can only hope that project 's disappearance has to do with a technical glitch , and not some political reason rooted in irrationality ( fear of alternative views ) , or worse . It just seems to be too foul that one of the surely very few SKEPTIC projects happens to be the one that has been affected in this way .
I 'm very curious to find out how all of this will unfold . I have a feeling we have not heard the last of this .
The Metropolitan Transportation Authority ( MTA ) today announced that the reconstruction of the Fresh Pond Bridge on the line will be successfully completed on September 1 as scheduled . This will conclude the first phase of a crucial $ 163 million project to replace two deteriorating line overpasses , the completion of which will ensure safe and reliable service for thousands of customers in Brooklyn and Queens . During Phase 1 , the MTA successfully rebuilt the century-old Fresh Pond Bridge using modern building materials that will ensure the safe operation of trains over the bridge for decades to come . This bridge is vital to service , carrying trains to its Queens terminus and providing access to subway car storage yards . Completion of the first phase of this project will allow the restoration of train service to four stations on the Myrtle Avenue line in Queens .
Phase 2 work on the elevated tracks atop the Myrtle Viaduct will begin on Saturday , September 2 . This century-old , 310-foot-long concrete structure connects the with the lines and has been in daily , non-stop use since it was built in 1913 . The aging concrete deck has deteriorated after decades of heavy use and exposure to inclement weather , and must be replaced along with the tracks and other infrastructure .
The reconstruction of the Myrtle Viaduct , which is located between the Myrtle Av and Central Av stations , involves building a concrete deck structure and safety walkways and installing new third rail , low-vibration tracks , new steel columns , new foundations , and new drainage . The work requires a full suspension of train service on the overpass to allow for its complete demolition and to provide unfettered access for workers . The work is expected to take eight months , ending in spring 2018 . Once the demolition and reconstruction are completed , customers who use the train or live near the track structure will notice a smoother ride and quieter track operations thanks to the new rails and infrastructure .
“ Work is on schedule for this critical line reconstruction project that is sorely needed on the Myrtle Avenue Line . Without rebuilding the Myrtle Viaduct and the Fresh Pond Bridge , we would not be able to continue to run trains safely because the deteriorating condition of these structures are getting to a point beyond what our crews can fix during routine maintenance . We thank our customers for their patience and we hope they will agree that the short-term inconvenience now will be worth the improved reliability moving forward , ” said MTA Managing Director Veronique Hakim .
During the final phase of the Myrtle Viaduct reconstruction , service operates in two sections : as local weekday service between Broadway Junction and Forest Hills-71 Av , and as a shuttle train service making all station stops between the Middle Village-Metropolitan Av terminus and Myrtle-Wyckoff Avs . The shuttle train will serve Metropolitan Av , Fresh Pond Rd , Forest Av , Seneca Av and Myrtle-Wyckoff Avs , running every 10 minutes during the day and every 20 minutes during overnight hours . At Myrtle-Wyckoff Avs , shuttle train customers can switch to the line or free shuttle buses for service to the Myrtle Av station . Customers paying with a MetroCard who have exited at either Myrtle-Wyckoff Avs or Myrtle Av and then transferred to the free shuttle bus can re-enter the subway station at the other end of the shuttle bus route , allowing customers to connect between Myrtle-Wyckoff Avs and Myrtle Av without paying twice .
For service to Knickerbocker Av or Central Av , which will continue to be closed during this work , customers can transfer to free shuttle buses to the Myrtle-Wyckoff Avs and Myrtle Av stations .
MTA New York City Transit has engaged in robust outreach with the communities affected by the line repairs and met with local leaders and community boards representing Bushwick , Ridgewood , Maspeth , Middle Village and Glendale prior to the start of the project . Transit personnel will be on site at affected stations and shuttle bus stops before the service change to provide information , assist customers and answer questions . MTA NYC Transit also has created a website to keep customers informed of the project . Approximately 60,000 customers use the line on an average weekday between the Myrtle Av and Middle Village-Metropolitan Av stations , which is the portion of the line affected by the entire reconstruction project . Ridership at the seven stations along that branch has grown 53 percent since 2000 .
MTA NYC Transit is dedicated to providing safe and reliable service to its customers , and the line reconstruction project is part of that promise to deliver and improve subway service . MTA Chairman Joseph Lhota has announced a subway action plan to stabilize and improve the subways and to modernize and grow the system . Their plan is in addition to the MTA 's 2015-2019 Capital Program , which allocates $ 14.5 billion for subway improvements over the next few years , including $ 4 billion for stations , $ 4.5 billion for signals and track work , and $ 1.7 billion for new cars . Details on the Capital Program are available at mta.info/capital .
Animal Testing Giant Joins the Vegan Movement # Daiya
Veganarchy Blocked Unblock Follow Jul 30 , 2017
By Lara Drew and Daniel Kidby
Daiya 's new logo
+On Friday it was announced that Daiya has been acquired by a large pharmaceutical company , Otsuka , who by their own admission conduct animal testing , we at Veganarchy have a few ideas on the situation we wanted to share .
+Whilst veganism is a necessary step toward animal liberation , there is a presumption that buying products marked “ vegan ” or “ cruelty-free ” is the end game of the animal advocacy movement , but veganism on its own is limiting and not sufficient by itself to bring about animal liberation . The acquisition of Daiya is a reminder that corporations have no ethics , and that there are ethical implications when consuming anything within an economic system that encourages unlimited growth and views the earth , animals ( both wild and domestic ) and humans as mere resources to profit from and exploit .
+Daiya were a $ 326 million dollar company . It would be naïve to assume that in order to grow into a corporate giant they did n't compromise their vegan values or develop a supply chain which included destructive monocultures , habitat and wildlife destruction and exploited farmworkers . In this society there is no such thing as a vegan company .
+It is the nature of capitalism that successful brands , whether marketed as ‘ ethical ' or not , wind up being bought by a bigger , badder company . Pretty much all successful brands eventually wind upcoming under the ownership of a few behemoths through mergers and acquisitions .
The reality of corporate ownership
+Whilst we do not support a multimillion dollar corporation that actively supports and conducts animal experimentation this boycott is motivated by ‘ moral purity ' , a desire to do no harm . But consumer capitalism is so destructive to this planet that we ca n't avoid causing harm . Unless you want to escape to your own off-grid veganic farm and live self-sufficient then you will be somewhat complicit in the violence of our system . If we want an ethical society , we should fight for a social revolution . A social revolution is needed otherwise veganism will remain entrenched in a capitalist system that reinforces vegan lifestyle-ism rather than making veganism part of a movement to oppose the political , economic and social systems which oppresses all life .
+This boycott is also motivated by the belief that we have power as consumers , that we can change society with our consumption habits . But there is never such a simple , easy answer to overturning oppression . Relying on maxims like “ change the world we must begin with ourselves ” is too simplistic as it risks seeing individual consumer choice as the only solution to global problems .
+The urge for vegans to boycott Daiya goes to show how many of us have been making use of this global processed factory product . This strongly highlights the strong reliance we have on global brands , and showcases our society 's addiction to consumer capitalism . We should n't have to wait for an animal testing giant to take over Daiya before we question our support of the business . Did we really all believe that Daiya were super ethical before this acquisition anyway ?
+This whole boycott discussion highlights a confusion of what it means to fight for animal liberation which is rooted in Donald Watson 's definition of veganism . Watson defined veganism as a “ philosophy and way of living which seeks to exclude — as far as is possible and practicable — all forms of exploitation of , and cruelty to , animals… ” . This definition denotes veganism as a ‘ lifestyle ' rather than a justice movement . It places a burden on people to strive for purity in the here and now , rather than fighting to overturn the society which makes animal abuse possible . It places a boycott tactic at the centre of animal liberation with the underlying message that vegan capitalism will save animals . As a community we boycott in reaction to everything ! No tactic , boycott or otherwise , should be the focal point of a movement strategy , any tactic is just a single weapon in an strategic arsenal and should be used when appropriate and effective .
Capitalism Fails Us
+To change the enormous and complex problems we face we must think creatively . Audre Lorde 's well known phrase captures this the best : ‘ the masters tools will never dismantle the master 's house ' . In other words , we need to agitate for new spaces of resistance and liberation and move beyond a consumer boycott only approach .
+It is worth noting that the outrage and opposition to this acquisition and the resulting boycott by both individuals and businesses ( see for instance the Cruelty Free Shop ) has the possibility , at least in the short term , to be picked up by the mainstream media . And hopefully it can result in a few news stories which register our opposition to Otsuka 's animal testing practices .
+As far as a long-term permanent boycott goes , some might feel that boycotting a multi-billion company that supports animal experimentation is more ethically consistent with the philosophy and practices of a compassionate and just world . And of course if we can do better then there is no reason not to act .
+We certainly are not in agreement with the camp of people who think that we ought to continue to buy Daiya products , and other vegan consumer goods , in order to promote a vegan consumer market and give corporations new ways to profit from expensive middle-class consumer goods . This kind of argument shows a misunderstanding of the workings of capitalism and its ability to co-opt justice movements . In this case , it has the effect of inviting an animal testing corporate giant into the animal liberation movement .
+But overall it is your decision whether you decide to boycott Daiya based on what feels right for you and your own values , but regardless what your decision is , make sure that boycotting is not all that you do .
But let 's be honest , how many of us will remember this in six months time ? 😉

Strive for Utopia
Exclusive | Kevin W. Bowyer , Chair of the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Notre Dame , Indiana is out to create a tool to reliably identify criminals who may be hanging out at the crime scene after the event .
Their Questionable Observer Detector ( QuOD ) can process any available video clips of groups of people present at the scene of event , spanning different times and locations to pick out any person who appears frequently in them . “ The idea is that the person showing up unusually often as part of the crowd at these events may be someone that the police would want to talk to , ” says Bowyer .
For instance , if given video clips of the serial bomb attacks currently plaguing Abuja in Nigeria , the software could identify people appearing repeatedly , giving authorities leads on either the bombers or their helpers .
It 's an extremely challenging 3D facial recognition problem , since the system has no prior database to compare the faces with and works with videos taken by surveillance cameras and bystanders with their handheld video camera under any and all conditions . It detects potential suspects by creating individual “ face tracks ” for people appearing in every video , comparing them across videos to zero in on similar looking faces .
It takes the best image from a face track in one video and compares it with the top images derived from other face tracks in other videos to see if it can find the same face . When it spots a match , it adds it to a group of video appearances featuring just that person . It identifies an individual as a “ questionable observer ” if the final number of videos in their personal group exceeds a particular number , set earlier by authorities . This indicates that they appear often at numerous crime scenes .
A research prototype could be ready in less than a year , according to Bowyer , who hopes to work with the Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) and the Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity ( IARPA ) later on .
Is the QuOD a step further towards the dark picture painted by George Orwell in their novel 1984 of omnipresent surveillance and pre-emptive arrests ? Given that it is more about handing authorities a tool to identify suspects based on their actual presence solely at multiple disaster areas , as opposed to policing people on possible intent ( as in the movie Minority Report ) , the answer would have to be “ no . ”
There 's a new biopic of Alan Turing out this week . It 's called The Imitation Game and stars Benedict Cumberbatch as Turing , the genius computer scientist , cryptologist , and mathematician who is often credited with pioneering the modern idea of a computer , and also played a significant part in winning World War II through their work on decrypting German communications . For their trouble , they were prosecuted in 1952 for “ gross indecency ” — they were carrying on an affair with a man , which was illegal at the time . They pled guilty , was chemically castrated… and died , apparently by their own hand , barely two years later . The biopic is part of a resurgence of interest in Turing 's story ; they were given a long-overdue posthumous pardon by the Queen of England last year , and their life and work have also been explored in George Dyson 's excellent book Turing 's Cathedral and in the recent documentary film Codebreaker .
The story of Turing 's treatment is often presented these days as an example of How Far We 've Come : we live in a society where LGBT rights have advanced immeasurably , so much so that it 's startling to think that it was barely 60 years ago that Turing was being prosecuted and castrated for their sexual orientation . There are obviously still parts of the world where LGBT people are subjected to horrifying oppression , and there 's clearly some distance to go even in ostensibly tolerant societies like this one , but still , the level of ignorance about the spectrum of human sexuality is still significantly lower than it was in Turing 's day— or , at least , so we like to think .
It 's worth examining the circumstances of Turing 's case a bit more closely , though , because they reflect attitudes that remain pervasive in our society . Specifically , they represent ideas of gender essentialism that are still very much alive and well in 2014 .
It 's startling to think this , because the details of Turing 's punishment sound downright barbaric . The phrase “ chemical castration ” seems to come from another age , one of lobotomies and electroshock therapy and insulin comas . You might be surprised to know , then , that it 's actually still very much a thing today . It 's used in several US states , throughout Europe , and in various other places around the world . These days , it 's generally used as a treatment for recidivist sex offenders , and also in the treatment of hormone-dependent cancers .
So , how is it done ? The drugs used are antiandrogens , usually progesterone , which inhibit androgens from operating within the body . And what are androgens , you might ask ? They 're male sex hormones , basically — the chemicals that promote and regulate male characteristics in the human body . The best-known is testosterone ; others include dihydrotestosterone and androstenedione . Antiandrogens inhibit the production of androgens and/or their uptake by androgen receptors .
In Turing 's day , the treatment was still very much an experimental one , and instead of progesterone , they were given a synthetic estrogen . But according to Andrew Hodges ' excellent biography Alan Turing : The Enigma , the first experiments in chemical castration involved injecting men with testosterone .
To modern readers , this appears counterintuitive — of course injecting gay men with testosterone is n't going to decrease their sex drive ! To the thinking of Turing 's day , though , it made perfect sense , because that thinking started from the premise that , in Hodges ' words , “ [ psychology ] was dominated by the categories of ‘ masculine ' and ‘ feminine , ' with a belief that gay men and lesbian women had been endowed by nature with an unusual mixture of these all-important characteristics . ”
This point of view starts from an assumption that heterosexuality is “ normal , ” and thus being attracted to men is an inherently “ female ” characteristic . In theory , then , its suppression should come from an increase in the hormone that promotes male sexual characteristics , right ?
Wrong ! According to Hodges , the initial experiment with testosterone was a disaster : of the 11 men injected with testosterone , “ only three … reported benefit from this therapy . Five reported an intensification of the homosexual drive. ” Whoops ! It turned out that making men more manly was the complete opposite of what needed to be done ; instead , chemical castration actually functions by inhibiting the effect of androgens , rather than boosting them . And it does n't change the nature of sexual desire in the slightest ; it works by banishing the sex drive of the person undergoing treatment .
On face value , this would seem nevertheless to support the idea that sex and sexuality are inextricable , that there 's a direct causal link between sex hormones and the nature of sexual desire . In some ways , this is true : you do n't choose your sexual orientation any more than you choose any other aspect of your psyche . But it also indicates that gender and sexuality come from very different places .
To a Turing-era psychologist , a revised theory might go like this : well , OK , progesterone and estrogen are “ female ” hormones , and men are generally more interested in sex than women — so give female hormones to men , and their sex drive goes away . Only , it 's not that simple : estrogen and progesterone are pretty much polar opposites in their functions in the female body . Their relative levels regulate the menstrual cycle , and the former seems to increase a woman 's sex drive while the latter suppresses it . But in men , they both seem to reduce sexual drive . Conversely , men with an overabundance of androgens ( for example , because of the consumption of steroids ) tend to have a higher sex drive . However , such men also tend to develop higher levels of estradiol — a form of estrogen , basically — leading to the development of female physical characteristics ( most notably , growing breasts ) .
All any of this does is go to show is that gender , sex , and sexual orientation are three different things , each existing and being regulated independently of one another . They clearly interact , but the more you look into how they do so , the more you realize the folly of trying to ascribe aspects of gender and orientation to the nature of physical sex identity .
Gender , as Judith Butler famously wrote , “ is a performance. ” So too , in this respect , is sexual orientation — not in that it 's a choice that can be made , as bigots sometimes like to argue , but in that it 's an aspect of the personality that exists independent of gender and sex . Indeed , it seems to be unaffected by changes in either of those characteristics — the sexual orientation of trans men and women , for instance , is almost never affected by their physical transition . ( Even where this does seem to be the case , it may well be , as psychotherapist Ami Kaplan argues , “ perhaps what is really happening in these cases is that individuals are choosing partners more for the complex array of factors that help the individual feel confirmed in their authentically felt gender rather than for their desirability based on their maleness or femaleness . ” )
All of which is to say that gender essentialism is one of those beliefs that is still generally accepted as an unquestioned intuition : men and women are different , right ? Men are from Mars , women are from Venus , and all that ? And sure , humans are clearly sexually dimorphic . Beyond that , though , essentialism is one of those agreed-upon notions that start to disintegrate the minute you start to scrutinize them .
Turing 's case is a salutary example of what happens when one proceeds without questioning one 's assumptions . It was accepted as fact in the 1950s that heterosexuality was normal , that homosexuality was a condition to be cured , and that both of these things were related to the nature of one 's gender . When these assumptions were extrapolated into policy , the result was the dreadful mistreatment of a man who deserved far better . Turing 's legacy is in the field of science , and their treatment is a reminder of what the scientific method teaches us : question everything .
The last few days have been quite slow for India . As someone on Twitter explained ; since Narendra Modi came to power in a bloodless coup , aided by Shekhar Gupta , through which they deposed Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi they have been idle and doing nothing . It 's not just that they overthrew the ‘ Left-Honourable ' SoniaG 's govt but planted 282 of their own party members in the Lok Sabha . As Ashutosh and Somnath Bharti of AAP keep telling us , this is a “ joke on our democracy ” . Modi-Sarkar just got past the 100 day mark and all signs warn us of the dangers of their regime lasting another 3550 days and perhaps even beyond . Dark clouds hover over India as the Congress , AAP and our media rightly tell us . In these 100 days the world-renowned , respected , regarded , decorated media-man with the highest integrity-quotient quickly wrote a book to tell us how the 2014 coup changed India . Here 's Rajdeep Sardesai :
Readers should observe carefully how 46 years ago an American writer plagiarised Rajdeep 's cover-title for their book . As Kanchan Gupta points out , many will be reading Rajdeep 's book to understand how despite the most valiant attempts Rajdeep could n't stop a Hitler-like Modi from usurping power . India is in trouble as Barkha Dutt , S. Varadarajan ( Varadabhai ) , Hartosh Bal keep telling us . We should have heeded their warnings before May 2014 . But as Markandeya Katju established earlier , 90 % of Indians are fools . The other 10 % are in Congress , AAP , “ Sicko ” parties , NDTV , CNN-IBN , TimesNow and in Bengal and UP . Two days back NaMo addressed school kids in a brazen attempt to poison their minds with their communal agenda . They talked for so long that it left enough time for P. Malini , editor of The Love-Hindu , to run around thousands of schools in Bangalore to find this school where a kid wanted a bathroom-break during their speech :
See what I mean ? Millions of students may have listened to the barbaric speech of Modi but real patriotism and nationalism lies in finding out that one school , one classroom and one kid that wants a bathroom-break . The 90 % fools in India probably do n't understand the effort it takes to find this kid with their little finger up . You have to be awe-struck at the artistic skills that our media possesses . Stunning ! Talking of which , I can give you some cues on how such skills are acquired and what kind of “ genteel ” teachers impart those . Here :
Now you understand ? If you want your child to seek a career in journalism , find a school that has “ genteel Bonginis ” as teachers who use cuss words and your kid is on their way . Sunetra Chaudhury is living proof . I wonder how many kids in India who did n't learn the word “ shit ” in Class-2 fell into Katju 's 90 % and never made a mark in journalism or in any profession . So what in hell does Modi know about teachers or students ? Idle and with nothing to do , they are indulging in bladder-rocking speeches which send students to the toilets ( which may be non-existent in many schools ) . Rahul Gandhi , India 's greatest living intellectual , earlier pointed out that Modi went all the way to Japan to play drums . RG screamed “ Modi talked about corruption ” and is doing nothing . You ca n't disagree . One hopes Modi will at least start some corruption soon . It 's boring in the media . It was n't limited to playing drums . Modi had tea in Japan with their PM when they themselves is a tea-seller and tea is a lot cheaper in India . They were also feeding the fish in Japan when thousands are dying of hunger in India . All that was still tolerable but Modi went ahead and did the unthinkable :
You did n't have anything better to gift ? What were you thinking ? Did n't you have Shobha De 's books on philosophy ? Could n't you have waited for Rajdeep 's book ; fresh from the oven ? There 's Barkha Dutt writing their book ( she 's been writing for the last 15 years ) “ India 's fault-lines destroying Pakistan ” . Even otherwise , why gift a book like Bhagwad Gita which is full of hate verses loved by those communal , extremist Hindus and millions of such others in the world ? Modi did it knowing well that it would deeply hurt the sentiments of the “ Seculars ” which they cunningly hid from the public as the tweet-reports above indicate . Naturally , they asked the right questions to Modi :
Yeah ! Why not the Quran or the Bible ? Or the Torah ? Why not genuine Indian books which were born in India ? Why gift the Bhagwad Gita which was concocted and written in some corner of Azerbaijan ? Appalling ! NDTV is genuinely outraged at this undemocratic , anti-secular act of Modi gifting the Gita . They hired Paki-pimp Varadabhai to analyse the whole episode :
So Varadabhai ( I fondly call them that ) wrote a thesis “ Modi 's Gita Comment Was Dangerously Loaded ” . This is true ! Behind the act of gifting the Gita and that “ Seculars ” comment , Modi clearly has some “ Sudarshan Chakras ” hidden under their half-sleeved Kurtas which they might unleash anytime at the helpless minorities in India . The evidence gathered by Varadabhai is unimpeachable . Varadabhai 's conclusion that Modi has not even read the Gita , let alone understand it , is worthy of the Padma Bhushan or at least a Pulitzer from their home country . Kudos to the pimps at NDTV ! Oh by the way , Modi is not the only one who has never read or understood the Gita . We have some others in the same category who were ranting against Varadabhai :
The above two are media-friendly people so their ignorance of the Gita or Modi 's ignorance of it has to be even more shocking . They deserve our severe condemnation for questioning Varadabhai and indirectly their drug-vehicle NDTV . And what does it say about other hate-mongers who want to exploit this act of Modi with their versions of ads in promoting the Gita ?
Those who created this ad cleverly avoided adding Modi 's secret mantra : “ Utterly butterly commoonal – Amul ” ! Does n't matter ; we all know what 's going on behind that 56-inch chest . 100 days already wasted and many more will be wasted sinking India . Although the Congress , NDTV , TimesNow and other Sickos complain about Modi doing nothing they missed some signals they had given before the May 16 coup . They rightly observe they have done nothing and is still doing nothing . Were they sleeping for the last 14 years when they were doing nothing ? I wonder how all the intellectuals in these groups missed Modi 's accidental confession . Here 's their candid admission on a TV show ( 0.59 mins ) :
So what 's the big fuss about ? Modi secretly let out that they deserve no credit for Gujarat 's progress or development . They let out that they have no work and does no work for the govt . So why are they shocked now ? Modi is only doing what they have been doing for the last 14 years – NOTHING ! It 's only the Congress and our media folks who missed that and discovered it too late . We in Gujarat discovered it long back – that Modi does nothing . And we kept voting them because we belong in the 90 % group of Katju unlike the Congis , NDTV or Varadabhai .
black magic ” tricks frequently . I quote from an When Narendra Modi inaugurated the Sabarmati River front in Ahmedabad they took a boat ride . Strong winds blew off their cap which fell some 50 feet away from the boat on the water . An unperturbed Modi just got off the boat , walked on water , retrieved their cap and walked back to the boat ” . Modi has been giving all the signs that they will indulge in such black-magic again in the next few months . And when they do , you can expect the headlines from our media : “ Modi Ca n't Swim ” . Shame on him , no ? I 'm in a generous mood , though , and will do the Congis and our MSM a good turn . I will remind them of how Modi employs certain “ ” tricks frequently . I quote from an earlier post : “ ” . Modi has been giving all the signs that they will indulge in such black-magic again in the next few months . And when they do , you can expect the headlines from our media : “ ” . Shame on him , no ?

As Field Marshal Pochettino sent their troops off to the front line on Sunday ( apologies , I could n't resist continuing my military analogy that I began on this week 's Fighting Cock podcast ! ) my optimism concealed a fear that we would be up against a wounded José Mourinho who would eke out a victory in whatever manner they could . My preferred team selection was identical to the team Mauricio Pochettino opted for , and a bursting hopefulness surged through me as the players took to the pitch .
But Mourinho 's vengeful cynicism was translated to their team and from early in the match they broke up play with tactical fouls – stopping moves before they had started – whilst drawing cheap free-kicks themselves from our players , waiting for the slightest contact before collapsing to the turf . Some of our players showed a fair amount of naivety and walked into this trap , giving Chelsea precisely what they wanted .
Of course , it was n't just a cynical Chelsea performance – it was a truly commendable defensive display in a season where Premier League defending has been oft-criticised . John Terry ( * spits * ) was dominant , ably assisted by Gary Cahill , and Kurt Zouma did a fine job as an auxiliary midfield player . Our wide players rarely got the better of César Azpilicueta and Branislav Ivanović , and Chelsea kept us at arm 's length for most of the game .
But things could have been different . Spurs dominated the first half , playing some neat football and controlling the tempo of the match . Nabil Bentaleb was at their suave best , with Ryan Mason a bundle of industry and ( attempted ) invention beside him . With little help from the band of players behind him , Harry Kane was forced to drop deep to try to create for himself . On one such occasion , they drove through a clutch of defenders and won a free-kick . Christian Eriksen – so vital a player for much of the season , but recently suffering from # formloss – curled a beautiful free-kick over the wall , but it left the crossbar shaking with Petr Čech seemingly beaten by the pace of the attempt .
Chelsea scored at just the right time – a scruffy goal from a Spurs perspective – and went in at the break to receive instructions on how to shut up shop . Mourinho masterminded the second half to perfection , and it was Chelsea who looked most likely to score again , looking a genuine threat on the counter . It was somewhat inevitable that they got their second but , once again , it came via a deflection , which was unfortunate for Spurs and Kyle Walker in particular .
It was n't just Chelsea who showed defensive resilience , and I want to take a moment to praise Eric Dier who , for me , was our best player . At just 21 , and in their first season in the Premier League , they put in an outstanding performance . Diego Costa is a pig of a player . All elbows and mouth , they try to get under the skin of their opponent from early on , doing anything they can to gain an advantage . Dier was calm and dealt with them consistently well . Costa eventually got the better of us for the second goal , but they needed a big stroke of luck to do so – he 'd been kept quiet for the rest of the game . This performance from Dier – with many eyes on them – should be enough to ensure that they start at centre-back for England in the UEFA European Under-21 Championship in the Czech Republic this summer , an experience that will undoubtedly aid their development .
I left Wembley with a real sense of pride . Pride in our young team 's performance , and pride in our fans too . Post-match , Pochettino was keen to point out just how young the team was . They said : “ The average age for my players was 23 and a half and for many players it was their first time at Wembley . It 's true that we will play a lot of finals in the next few years . I think we have a big future . ”
Our fans were also fantastic , and out-sung our Chelsea counterparts for most of the match . It was a genuine delight when , after the opening Chelsea goal went in , a burst of ‘ Everywhere we go… ' started up in my block .
Tuscan Travails
My trip to Florence was an experience . Florence is a beautiful city , with beautiful food and , fortunately for us , beautiful weather , particularly on the Friday . But , despite good backing for our team in a tough match , it did n't click on the pitch , and not all of the players ' efforts matched up to those of our supporters .
On arriving in Florence , it would have been rude not to order pizza for lunch . I went for the ‘ Fiorentina ' , which the waiter found amusing . After a couple of beers and a quick stop at our B & B , we headed off to the stadium .
Pre-match , my friend and I had agreed to record interviews for Spurs TV ( 23:10 here ) , meaning that we were at the Stadio Artemio Franchi for 16:45 , over two hours prior to kick off .
After the interview was finished , we began walking around to where we presumed we could enter the ground . We drew plenty of stares from Fiorentina fans , so we kept our mouths shut and hid our colours . As we approached the last block before a dividing fence , we realised that we were probably going to have to walk all the way back around the stadium – a flight attendant confirmed as much . But after thirty minutes of walking back on ourselves , we met a bunch of Spurs fans walking towards us saying that there was no obvious way in around the other side either . We continued regardless and eventually came to a row of police officers , blocking off an entrance-way . We flashed our tickets , and walked through . Already the police vans were arriving behind them .
We passed through two layers of security , and received two very thorough security checks ( ! ) and entered the stadium . The first impression was that it was basic . The toilets were underground and pretty disgusting . There was no roof on our stand , and it felt “ industrial ” . Spurs had two sections , but there was a large sheet of Perspex between us , meaning that the atmosphere suffered throughout . We were so high in the stand that the strong wind became a factor , and we were freezing after a few minutes of being there . A small group of our fans stood on a concrete area to the front of the right-hand section and were noisy throughout , some not even stopping to look at the game ! Unfortunately , because they were so far below us , the noise did n't always carry and so the atmosphere felt sporadic and diluted .
The game itself was a crushing disappointment . I could understand the team selection , but would personally have played Harry Kane for the first sixty minutes . In spite of that , it felt like we were in control until Fazio 's sloppy pass led to the opener . Whilst this changed little in terms of what we needed to do in the match – we always needed to score at least once – it gave Fiorentina heart , and seemed to make us more desperate ; we lost the sense of calm that we 'd had prior to the goal .
Benji Stambouli and Ben Davies had good first halves , but rustiness and a lack of sharpness showed in the second , and Davies in particular had a tough time up against Mohamed Salah , who had switched sides . Eriksen had some flashes of good play , but was dispossessed five times – they were hindered by not having Kane to dovetail with . Roberto Soldado cut a troubled figure . The missed opportunity – where they tried to find Nacer Chadli – was obviously a huge error , but it was their lack of movement and effort that was particularly striking . Or not striking , that was the issue . They lacked desire and played like a man whose mind was elsewhere .
In the end we made it easy for Fiorentina to beat us – a real shame , especially since they 'd changed shape at half-time in the first leg to make it difficult for us to beat them .
Post-match , we expected a twenty minute wait , as had been advertised . After fifty minutes of being penned in behind large metal gates , with rain coming down heavier and heavier , the gates were opened . As we left this area , we were confronted with riot police – shields and batons at the ready – and numerous police cars and vans were parked along our route . As we got to the entrance-way where the line of police had been stood on the way in , we were told to board buses bound for the city centre . Our B & B was nearer the stadium than the centre , so we ignored the instruction and continued through the barricade , and saw no trouble ( and barely another football fan ! ) . We had a good dinner in a restaurant in which Fiorentina fans were also dining , and any interaction was friendly and calm .
Florence is a beautiful city , and Spurs ' performance did n't do it justice . But the competition has been good for us , and we might not have the Harry Kane that we do were it not for this season 's Europa League . I look forward to hopefully being in the competition again next season , but I would understand if Pochettino used it to give more young players a chance .
OKLAHOMA CITY , Nov 19 ( Reuters ) - A U.S. federal judge on Monday denied a legal challenge to President Barack Obama 's signature health reforms , ruling that the owners of a $ 3 billion arts and crafts chain must provide emergency contraceptives in their group health care plan .
The owners of Hobby Lobby asked to be exempted from providing the “ morning after ” and “ week after ” pills on religious grounds , arguing this would violate their Christian belief that abortion is wrong .
Judge Joe Heaton of the U.S. District for the Western District of Oklahoma denied the request for a preliminary injunction .
Heaton ruled that while individual members of the family that owns and operates Hobby Lobby have religious rights , the companies the family owns are secular , for-profit enterprises that do not possess the same rights .
Kyle Duncan , general counsel for the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty in Washington , D.C. , which assisted Hobby Lobby in the legal challenge , said Monday 's ruling will be appealed .
Hobby Lobby , the largest non-Catholic U.S. company to go to court over the issue of contraceptives in the Affordable Care Act , is owned by the Green family of Oklahoma City . Patriarch David Green is ranked 79th on Forbes Magazine 's list of the 400 richest Americans with a net worth of $ 4.5 billion .
The family operate 514 Hobby Lobby stores in 41 states and employ 13,240 people . It funds a variety of Christian charities , closes its stores on Sundays and plays inspirational Christian music in its stores .
The Green family also sought contraceptive health insurance exemption for Mardel , their family-owned bookstore and educational supply company that has 35 stores in seven states with 372 employees .
The Oklahoma City-based companies already had been unwittingly providing the emergency contraceptives until they realized they were done so during the debate over provisions of what conservatives have dubbed “ Obamacare , ” according to court testimony . They discontinued that coverage only recently , testimony showed .
The Food and Drug Administration lists the “ morning after ” and “ week after ” pills as emergency contraceptives . But abortion opponents like the Green family consider them abortion-inducing drugs because they are often taken after conception .
Hobby Lobby faces a Jan. 1 deadline to comply with the mandate to provide all FDA-approved contraceptives . Failure to do so would entail a penalty of up to $ 1.3 million per day .
There are more than 40 other lawsuits challenging the health care mandate that requires that all group health plans provide emergency contraceptives , according to the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty . ( Reporting by Steve Olafson ; Editing by Nick Carey and Lisa Shumaker )
With 16 seconds left and the Devils ahead , the Rangers saw their playoff chances slipping away .
But Chris Drury tied the game with a late goal , and the Rangers defeated the Devils , 4-3 , in a shootout win Thursday night at the Prudential Center .
Rangers center Erik Christensen scored the only shootout goal , clinching the win for the Rangers . Christensen came down and fired a shot low on Devils ' goalie Martin Brodeur . The puck bounced off the right post and seemed to go into the net for the goal . The officials first ruled no goal , but video replays showed the puck hit the netting and came out of the goal . Christensen was credited with the shootout tally .
The Rangers would n't have got to the shootout if not for Chris Drury .
With the Rangers trailing , 3-2 , Drury scored with 16 seconds left in the third period to tie the game at three . After winning the faceoff , the Rangers sent the puck behind the net . Christensen controlled the puck and sent a backhanded pass to the crease . Drury one-timed the puck past the pads of Brodeur for their 12th goal of the season .
Jamie Langenbrunner gave the Devils a lead , 3-2 , at 12:57 of the third period . With the Rangers in the midst of a line change , Patrik Elias Elias sent a backhanded pass to Langenbrunner along the blue line . The captain skated the puck into the left circle and blasted a puck past Lundqvist for their 17th goal of the season .
Ilya Kovalchuk began the scoring at 5:21 of the first period . The Devils moved into the zone with a 3-on-2 rush , and Brian Rolston put a slap shot on goalie Henrik Lundqvist . The puck bounced off the heel of their glove , and Kovalchuk put the rebound through Lundqvist 's pads for their 38th goal of the year .
Rolston 's assist was their first point in seven games .
Brandon Dubinsky 's powerplay goal at 7:32 of the second period tied the game at one . With Rolston in the box for interference , Dubinsky collected a loose puck behind the net . They skated to the side boards and passed the puck to Michael Del Zotto , who passed the puck right back on a give-and-go . Dubinsky skated into the right circle and shot the puck through a screen and into the net for their 17th goal of the season .
With the game tied at one , Brodeur made a spectacular save to keep the game tied early in the third . The Rangers took possession of the puck behind the net . A pass came to a wide-open Ollie Jokinen in the slot . The center rifled a shot on goal , but Brodeur stopped the shot with their mask for the save .
Elias ' goal at 3:53 of the third period put the Devils ahead , 2-1 . David Clarkson collected a loose puck behind the net and skated it to the side boards . Elias , coming off the bench , found an open spot in the slot . They one-timed Clarkson 's pass over the glove of Lundqvist for their 14th goal of the season .
The Rangers came back to even the score with a goal from Artem Anisimov at 9:40 of the third period . Anisimov 's goal came from a bad defensive play by Bryce Salvador . With Brandon Prust and Salvador racing for the puck in the Devils zone , Salvador decided to try and play Prust instead of the puck . Prust skated by Salvador and sent a centering pass to Anisimov at the front of the net . Anisimov held the puck , and Brodeur went down to the butterfly . Anisimov lifted the puck over a helpless Brodeur and into the net for their 12th goal of the season .
Lundqvist helped keep the Rangers in the game the entire night . They stopped Elias on two different breakaway opportunities , denying Elias with the pads on both attempts .
Brodeur finished the game with 28 . Lundqvist finished with 35 saves for the victory .
With the win , the Rangers move within three points of the Boston Bruins for the eighth and final playoff spot in the Eastern Conference . The Blueshirts , currently 10th in the standings , sit one point behind Atlanta for the ninth spot in the conference .
Despite the loss , the Devils grabbed first place from the idle Pittsburgh Penguins . Since the Thrashers gained a point tonight , the Devils did not clinch a playoff spot .
Game Notes :
Jody Shelly and Andrew Peters dropped the gloves at 9:01 of the first period . Shelly landed most of the punches , but Peters knocked them to the ice with a solid right to end the fight…The Devils took first because of their head-to-head record with the Pittsburgh Penguins…Langenbrunner 's goal ended an eight-game goal drought…Ryan Callahan left tonight 's game and did n't return after re-aggravating a leg injury…Tonight 's game was the 12th sellout of the season , a record for the Devils at the Prudential Center .

Imagine , again , the cell as a complex machine , with thousands of wheels , levers and pulleys organized into systems . The machine malfunctions in the cancer : Some set of levers and pulleys gets jammed or broken , resulting in a cell that continues to divide without control . If we focus on the individual parts that are jammed and snapped , the permutations are seemingly infinite : Every instance of a broken machine seems to have a distinct fingerprint of broken cogs . But if we focus , instead , on systems that malfunction , then the seeming diversity begins to collapse into patterns of unity . Ten components function , say , in an interconnected loop to keep the machine from tipping over on its side . Snap any part of this loop , and the end result is the same : a tipped-over machine . Another 20 components control the machine 's internal thermostat . Break any of these 20 components , and the system overheats . The number of components — 10 and 20 — are deceptive in their complexity , and can have endless permutations . But viewed from afar , only two systems in this machine are affected : stability and temperature .
Cancer , Vogelstein argues , is analogous . Most of the genes that are mutated in cancer also function in loops and circuits — pathways . Superficially , the permutations of genetic flaws might be boundless , but lumped into pathways , the complexity can be organized along the archetypal , core flaws . Perhaps these cancer pathways are like Hollywood movies ; at first glance , there seems to be an infinite array of plot lines in an infinite array of settings — gold-rush California , the Upper West Side , a galaxy far , far away . But closer examination yields only a handful of archetypal narratives : boy meets girl , stranger comes to town , son searches for father .
How many such pathways , or systems , operate across a subtype of cancer ? Looking at one cancer , pancreatic , and mapping the variations in mutated genes across hundreds of specimens , Vogelstein 's team proposed a staggeringly simple answer : 12 . ( One such “ core pathway , ” for instance , involves genes that enable cells to invade other tissues . These genes normally allow cells to migrate through parts of the body — but in cancer , migration becomes distorted into invasion . ) If we could find medicines that could target these 12 core pathways , we might be able to attack most pancreatic cancers , despite their genetic diversity . But that means inventing 12 potential ways to block these core paths — an immense creative challenge for scientists , considering that they have n't yet figured out how to target more than , at best , one or two .
Immunological therapies provide a second solution to the impasse of unlimited diversity . One advantage of deploying a patient 's own immune system against cancer is that immunological cells are generally agnostic to the mutations that cause a particular cancer 's growth . The immune system was designed to spot differences in the superficial features of a diseased or foreign cell , thereby identifying and killing it . It cares as little about genes as an intercontinental ballistic missile cares about the email addresses , or dietary preferences , of the population that it has been sent to destroy .
A few years ago , in writing a history of cancer , I interviewed Emil Freireich . Freireich , working with Emil Frei at the National Cancer Institute in the 1960s and '70s , stumbled on the idea of deploying multiple toxic drugs simultaneously to treat cancer — combination chemotherapy . They devised one of the first standard protocols — vincristine , Adriamycin , methotrexate and prednisone , known as VAMP — to treat pediatric leukemias . Virtually nothing about the VAMP protocol was individualized ( although doses could be reduced if needed ) . In fact , doctors were discouraged from trying alternatives to the formula .
Yet as Freireich recalled , long before they came up with the idea for a protocol , there were small , brave experiments ; before trials , there was trial and error . VAMP was brought into existence through grit , instinct and inspired lunges into the unknown . Vincent T. DeVita Jr. , who worked with Freireich in the 1960s , wrote a book , “ The Death of Cancer , ” with their daughter , Elizabeth DeVita-Raeburn . In it , they recalled a time when the leukemic children in Freireich 's trial were dying of bacterial meningitis during treatment . The deaths threatened the entire trial : If Freireich could n't keep the children alive during the therapy , there would be no possibility of remission . They had an antibiotic that could kill the microbe , but the medicine would n't penetrate the blood-brain barrier . So Freireich decided to try something that pushed the bounds of standard practice . They ordered DeVita , their junior , to inject it directly into the spinal cords of their patients . It was an extreme example of off-label use of the drug : The medicine was not meant for use in the cord . DeVita writes :
“ The first time Freireich told me to do it , I held up the vial and showed them the label , thinking that he 'd possibly missed something . ‘ It says right on there , “ Do not use intrathecally , ” ' I said . Freireich glowered at me and pointed a long , bony finger in my face . ‘ Do it ! ' they barked . I did it , though I was terrified . But it worked every time . ”
When I asked Freireich about that episode and about what they would change in the current landscape of cancer therapy , they pointed to its extreme cautiousness . “ We would never have achieved anything in this atmosphere , ” they said . The pioneer of protocols pined for a time before there were any protocols .
Medicine needs standards , of course , otherwise it can ramble into dangerous realms , compromising safety and reliability . But cancer medicine also needs a healthy dose of Freireich : the desire to read between the ( guide ) lines , to reimagine the outer boundaries , to perform the experiments that become the standards of the future . In January , President Obama introduced an enormous campaign for precision medicine . Cancer is its molten centerpiece : Using huge troves of data , including gene sequences of hundreds of thousands of specimens and experiments performed in laboratories nationwide , the project 's goal is to find individualized medicines for every patient 's cancer . But as we wait for that decades-long project to be completed , oncologists still have to treat patients now . To understand the minds of individual cancers , we are learning to mix and match these two kinds of learning — the standard and the idiosyncratic — in unusual and creative ways . It 's the kind of medicine that so many of us went to medical school to learn , the kind that we 'd almost forgotten how to practice .
Associated Press - AUSTIN ( AP ) -- A federal judge has cleared the way for the government 's lawsuit seeking $ 100 million in damages from Lance Armstrong .
The decision Monday by U.S. District Judge Christopher Cooper in Washington sets the nearly 7-year-old case on course for a jury trial . The lawsuit was filed in 2010 by Armstrong 's former U.S . Postal Service teammate Floyd Landis , who could collect up to 25 percent .
The government joined the case in 2013 after Armstrong publicly admitted using performance-enhancing drugs to win the Tour de France seven times . Armstrong was stripped of those titles and banned from competition .
Armstrong tried to get the lawsuit dismissed , arguing the team sponsorship was worth far more to the Postal Service than the $ 32 million it paid from 2000 to 2004 .

Syria 's declared equipment for producing , mixing and filling chemical weapons has been destroyed , the international watchdog says .
This comes a day before the deadline set by the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons ( OPCW ) .
The weapons have been placed under seal , an OPCW spokesperson said .
Inspectors were sent to Syria following allegations , denied by the government , that its forces had used chemical weapons in civilian areas .
Analysis The achievement of this crucial initial target is an important moment for the chemical weapons destruction effort in Syria . The inspectors ' first task was to move swiftly to prevent the government from producing any more chemical agent and to destroy facilities and equipment used for mixing agents and filling munitions . Production facilities will be closely monitored to ensure that there are no moves to repair them . The next deadline is mid-November , by which time the OPCW and the Syrians must agree a detailed plan to destroy Syria 's chemical weapons stockpile . All sorts of questions are raised . Where will this destruction be carried out ? Who will provide the necessary equipment and so on ? Western intelligence agencies will be studying Syria 's declarations carefully . They will be eager to direct inspectors to additional locations if there are any grounds to believe that Damascus has been less than frank in its disclosures .
The inspections were agreed between Russia and the US after Washington threatened to use force in Syria .
Syria 's Deputy Foreign Minister Faisal Mekdad told the BBC 's Lyse Doucet that it had not been difficult for Syria 's government to meet its obligations , as some had initially feared .
`` I hope those who have always thought of us negatively will change their minds and understand that Syria was , is , and will be always a constructive partner , '' Mr Mekdad told our correspondent .
Now that the equipment has been put beyond use , Syria has until mid-2014 to destroy the chemical weapons themselves .
In Washington , US state department official Thomas Countryman said : `` I am increasingly confident that we will be able to complete this task ... within the target date of 30 June of next year '' .
Mr Countryman , the assistant secretary for international security and non-proliferation , told US lawmakers that `` our target dates are ambitious but they are achievable '' .
Syria 's arsenal is believed to include more than 1,000 tonnes of the nerve gas sarin , the blister agent sulphur mustard and other banned chemicals , stored at dozens of sites .
In a separate development , a large explosion at a Syrian army base has been reported outside the coastal city of Latakia .
A White House official told the BBC Israeli planes carried out the attack , saying they believed the intended target was Russian missiles .
Separately , a US security official said Russian-made SA-125 missiles had been targeted , according to the Associated Press news agency .
Israel has not commented on the reports .
Israel is believed to have targeted the same base in July and is concerned that some weapons in Syria are being moved to Hezbollah militants in neighbouring Lebanon .
'Challenging job '
OPCW head of field operations Jerry Smith told the BBC that their team had `` personally observed all the destruction activities '' .
`` They are not now in a position to conduct any further production or mixing of chemical weapons , '' they said .
In a statement , the OPCW said its teams had inspected 21 of the 23 chemical weapons sites in Syria .
The other two were too dangerous to visit but the equipment had already been moved to some of the other sites , it said .

Mr Smith said that verifying the destruction of Syria 's weapons production capability had been a `` particularly challenging job '' because it had to be done in the midst of a conflict , with a tight deadline .
The OPCW earlier this month won the Nobel Peace Prize but Mr Smith said their team had been too busy to celebrate because of their work in Syria .

`` All stocks of chemical weapons and agents have been placed under seals that are impossible to break , '' OPCW spokesperson Christian Chartier told the AFP news agency .
`` These are 1,000 tonnes of chemical agents [ which can be used to make weapons ] and 290 tonnes of chemical weapons , '' they said .
The BBC 's Jim Muir in Beirut says the OPCW 's task is far from finished .
More than 1,000 tonnes of chemical precursors - the raw materials - remain to be removed and destroyed by the middle of next year , which our correspondent says will be a delicate and difficult process .
The first step is for the weapons watchdog and the Syrian government to agree a timetable for the destruction of the chemical weapons stockpile - this should be done within the next two weeks .
The US says more than 1,400 people were killed when government forces used a nerve agent to attack Ghouta on the outskirts of Damascus on 21 August .
Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and their Russian allies have said rebel groups were responsible .

The OPCW announcement comes as human rights group Amnesty International says that hundreds of Syrian refugees are being turned away at the borders of Jordan and other countries .
Jordan has denied the accusation , saying its border is open to Syrian refugees .
More than 100,000 people have been killed in the fighting that has ravaged Syria for two-and-a-half years , according to the UN .
A further two million people have fled Syria and some 4.5 million have been displaced internally .
The Beatles , to be clear , were seminal , visionary , belief-buggeringly brilliant .

10 . Ob-La-Di , Ob-La-Da
Lennon reportedly dismissed McCartney 's White Album clanker as “ granny music shit ” , and they were being generous . From the opening teeth-on-edge piano flourish , it 's a nagging , plinky-plonk , cod-reggae monstrosity , like a rejected jingle for a shelved Lunn Poly ad . And the most infuriating thing is that your four-year-old keeps asking for it , instead of A Day In The Life .

Side One of Abbey Road hits the skids with this pointless stinker , which alternates between a turgid descending riff that should never have made it past soundcheck , and the most coma-inducing of blues jams .

The Let It Be sessions dripped with venom , but there 's a chink of misguided bonhomie on this mucky Scouse knees-up . The fruity jangle grinds to an abrupt halt after 39 seconds , as if the Fabs have suddenly realised how history will judge it .
7 . Wild Honey Pie
With their bandmates away , a heel-kicking McCartney knocked out this screechy head-scratcher . By rights , it should have been buried deep in the vaults ; blame the cloth-eared Pattie Boyd , who inexplicably convinced Macca it deserved a spot on the White Album tracklisting .
6 . Blue Jay Way
The premise was hardly thrilling – a jet-lagged Harrison birthed the song while waiting for their publicist to arrive in LA – and the resulting psych swirl was like listening to paint dry . “ Please do n't be long , please do n't you be very long , ” moans the vocal , pretty much echoing the listener 's sentiments exactly .
5 . Within You Without You
Speaking of Harrison misfires , let 's not forget the nadir of Sgt Pepper 's slack mid-section ( see also : Being For The Benefit Of Mr Kite ! and When I 'm Sixty Four ) . A drowsy , incense-wafting drone with lyrics apparently written by a third-rate life coach , it evokes the feeling of waiting for a takeaway in Hell .

I could happily take a chainsaw to the White Album , and this faux-redneck doodle would be amongst the first candidates for the chop . Neither funny nor experimental , memorable or melodic , this lazy McCartney-penned strum should have stayed in Rishikesh , with even George Martin admitting it was “ filler ” to satisfy the release 's double-format .

A piano tinkles . A cut-glass disembodied voice burbles a repeated ‘ number nine ' . Tape loops swim and swirl . An orchestra tunes up . A fire crackles .

It inspired a killing spree – Charles Manson 's followers notoriously daubing ‘ Pig ' on the front door of actor Sharon Tate 's house in August 1969 , having slaughtered all within – but amazingly , that 's not even the worst thing about Piggies .

Yeah , I know the official line : Yesterday is a tender , stately , much-loved all-time classic that perfectly articulates the travails of passing time . But is it , really ? Because after enduring the Help ! original for over half a century – not to mention the 2000-plus cover versions – all I hear is a sickly , mawkish , ubiquitous , unflushable turd . And what really sticks in my craw is that back in 2012 , the BBC calculated that Yesterday had generated some £19.5 million in royalty payments . Give me The Frog Chorus any day…

How George Harrison Made The Greatest Beatles Solo Album Of Them All
Whisper it , but it is only six weeks before that moment Chelsea fans have been dreading more than any other .
At 4pm on Sunday 23rd October , Jose Mourinho will return to Stamford Bridge , as Manchester United boss , and the eyes of the world will be upon the spectacle .
They have been back in opposition before , of course , but never as a domestic rival – never as one standing between Chelsea and the very trophy they delivered them three times .
And the emotions are likely to be very raw when the moment comes .
The headlines this week quoting two Chelsea players applying a good thumb-print of tarnish to the already slightly faded gleam of The Special One 's Stamford Bridge gleam , were a sign of things to come .
Eden Hazard 's barbs about the way Conte 'played the game ' , so knows how to put trust in their payers ; and those from Gary Cahill about the need for Chelsea to have a game plan were , consciously or otherwise , directed only one way .
International breaks are tricky times for club PR departments – none more so than Chelsea 's .
Players head off in all different directions , far from the beady eye and gentle coaxing of their day-to-day press officers , and are asked all manner of questions by media not usually camped on their patch .
Hazard is well known for nonchalantly kicking-up a storm while away with Belgium , and one imagines Chelsea are ready to roll into crisis management mode pretty much every time they return from international duty .
But , in this case , those quotes are far more innocent than they may at first seem : having first got an airing two weeks back – displayed , of all places , on the Chelsea club website .
Missed by the press at the time , they have gone through an evolution whereby they were rehashed in Spain , and then resurrected for Thursday morning 's papers once more .
But , featured beneath the star name Hazard in most publications , it is the Cahill lines which are more pointed .
The defender is generally seen as a safe pair of hands with the media by their club : they speak well , but is adept at keeping to a brief .
It would be very un-Cahill-like for them to be as direct to lambaste the ex-boss ' game plan , without at least some initial steer from the people who pay theirs wages .
The club knows it , the smartest of the players know it , and most fans in their heart of hearts know it : Chelsea need to wrench themselves away from the idolatry of Mourinho , and they need to do it quick .
And this seems to be just the start of that – this weekend 's Manchester derby being the peg on to which the longer strategy has , for now , been hanged .
The bigger fight will be that in the stands , where opinion is still very much divided on Mourinho .
Here , most appear to be happy to remember great times with their ex , but there is a difference of opinion over whether people still hanker after their affections .
The issue of the 'Jose Mourinho : simply the best ' banner has been a sore one since the day they left .

Keep it up ? Take it down ? Or , as was jokingly suggested by one influential fan : hang it upside down , or stick it on a bonfire ?
The problem with such bold proclamations in football is that loyalty is short : and 'the best ' is only that , until your new best comes along .
The temperature of the reaction Mourinho receives when they return will , in large , be decided by what comes out of their own mouth in the week before that .
While it is in Chelsea 's interests , not least for the respect and support of Antonio Conte , to put clear blue water between them and he ; it is also in Mourinho 's interests to prove that they are now United through and through .
Over the course of those coming six weeks , these are the battles we will see fought out .
But , whatever the intentions , remember this : there really is no such thing as a friendly divorce .
Summary : Meditation can help people to take their negative emotions , a new study reports .
Source : Michigan State University .
Meditation can help tame your emotions even if you 're not a mindful person , suggests a new study from Michigan State University .
Reporting in the journal Frontiers in Human Neuroscience , psychology researchers recorded the brain activity of people looking at disturbing pictures immediately after meditating for the first time . These participants were able to tame their negative emotions just as well as participants who were naturally mindful .
“ Our findings not only demonstrate that meditation improves emotional health , but that people can acquire these benefits regardless of their ‘ natural ' ability to be mindful , ” said Yanli Lin , an MSU graduate student and lead investigator of the study . “ It just takes some practice . ”
Mindfulness , a moment-by-moment awareness of one 's thoughts , feelings and sensations , has gained worldwide popularity as a way to promote health and well-being . But what if someone is n't naturally mindful ? Can they become so simply by trying to make mindfulness a “ state of mind ” ? Or perhaps through a more focused , deliberate effort like meditation ?
The study , conducted in Jason Moser 's Clinical Psychophysiology Lab , attempted to find out .
Researchers assessed 68 participants for mindfulness using a scientifically validated survey . The participants were then randomly assigned to engage in an 18-minute audio guided meditation or listen to a control presentation of how to learn a new language , before viewing negative pictures ( such as a bloody corpse ) while their brain activity was recorded .
The participants who meditated – they had varying levels of natural mindfulness – showed similar levels of “ emotion regulatory ” brain activity as people with high levels of natural mindfulness . In other words their emotional brains recovered quickly after viewing the troubling photos , essentially keeping their negative emotions in check .
In addition , some of the participants were instructed to look at the gruesome photos “ mindfully ” ( be in a mindful state of mind ) while others received no such instruction . Interestingly , the people who viewed the photos “ mindfully ” showed no better ability to keep their negative emotions in check .
This suggests that for non-meditators , the emotional benefits of mindfulness might be better achieved through meditation , rather than “ forcing it ” as a state of mind , said Moser , MSU associate professor of clinical psychology and co-author of the study .
“ If you 're a naturally mindful person , and you 're walking around very aware of things , you 're good to go . You shed your emotions quickly , ” Moser said . “ If you 're not naturally mindful , then meditating can make you look like a person who walks around with a lot of mindfulness . But for people who are not naturally mindful and have never meditated , forcing oneself to be mindful ‘ in the moment ' does n't work . You 'd be better off meditating for 20 minutes . ”

Abstract
Deconstructing the Emotion Regulatory Properties of Mindfulness : An Electrophysiological Investigation
The present study sought to uncover the emotion regulatory properties of mindfulness by examining its effects—differentiated as a meditative practice , state of mind and dispositional trait—on the late positive potential ( LPP ) , an event-related potentials ( ERPs ) indexing emotional processing . Results revealed that mindfulness as a meditative practice produced a reduction in the difference between the LPP response to negative high arousing and neutral stimuli across time . In contrast , a state mindfulness induction ( i.e. , instructions to attend to the stimuli mindfully ) failed to modulate the LPP . Dispositional mindfulness , however , was related to modulation of the LPP as a function of meditation practice . Dispositional mindfulness was associated with a reduction of the LPP response to negative high arousal stimuli and the difference between negative high arousal and neutral stimuli in participants who listened to a control audio recording but not for those who engaged in the guided meditation practice . Together , these findings provide experimental evidence demonstrating that brief mindfulness meditation , but not deliberate engagement in state mindfulness , produces demonstrable changes in emotional processing indicative of reduced emotional reactivity . Importantly , these effects are akin to those observed in individuals with naturally high dispositional mindfulness , suggesting that the benefits of mindfulness can be cultivated through practice .

News that the actor has been given the honour – which stands for Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire – for services to the performing arts and to charity comes after rumours surfaced earlier this week .
Joining them on the list is their colleague , Sherlock writer and Doctor Who is a showrunner , Steven Moffat who gets an OBE – one down from a CBE and standing for Officer of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire . Moffat has been given the gong “ for services to drama ” .
They said of their award : “ I never thought I would get something like this . I 'm astonished and more thrilled than I ever thought someone like me would be . I 'm not the least bit cynical , or the least bit trying to be cool about it . I 'm just really , really happy . ”
Actor Eddie Redmayne , who won an Oscar this year for their portrayal of Stephen Hawking in the film The Theory of Everything , is also awarded an OBE with the same citation .
The honours list sees a Knighthood for Lenny Henry for their professional and charity work , something which the Comic Relief stalwart revealed earlier this week , telling Radio 2 host Chris Evans that the award made them feel like they had been “ filled with lemonade ” .
A Knighthood also goes to singer Van Morrison for “ services to the music industry and tourism in Northern Ireland . ”
Other notable recipients from the entertainment industry include Paddington creator Michael Bond who gets a CBE , as does Twelve Years a Slave actor and 2014 Oscar nominee Chiwetel Ejiofor .
There are also OBEs for broadcaster Nicky Campbell for their work as Patron of the British Association for Adoption and Fostering , singer Michael Ball , and actor Martin Clunes , known for their roles in Doc Martin and Men Behaving Badly .
There is an honorary knighthood for American actor Kevin Spacey , outgoing artistic director of the Old Vic theatre in London and a CBE for TV presenter Loyd Grossman for “ services to heritage ” .
From the world of sport , England 's Rugby World Cup winner Jonny Wilkinson is awarded a CBE while former Welsh rugby star Jonathan Davies gets an OBE .
The Queen 's Birthday Honours List , published on Saturday 13th June , recognises the achievements of a wide range of extraordinary people right across the UK .
There are 86 years between the oldest and youngest recipients on this list – an MBE goes to 103­-year­-old Dr William Frankland , a pioneer in allergy research who introduced this specialism to the UK , and a gong for 17­-year­-old Natasha Lambert who was born with athetoid cerebral palsy and is recognised for their charitable fundraising . They get a British Empire Medal , known as a BEM .
In total , 1,163 people have received an award , with 70 per cent of the recipients people who have undertaken outstanding work in their communities either in a voluntary or paid capacity .

There are 595 female candidates on the list , representing 51 % of the total .
As the nation 's only nonprofit distributor , Small Press Distribution is dedicated to getting small press literature to the people who want to read it . As such , we 're grateful to our main customers—indie bookstores—the outward-facing purveyors who present our books to the public with flair and aplomb . To celebrate the great individuality of our favorite indie stores across the country , SPD 's asked a few of them to shine a monthly spotlight on ten of their favorite SPD-distributed titles . This month , we 're excited to host Oakland bookstore East Bay Booksellers .
This fall , DIESEL Bookstore in Oakland , California became East Bay Booksellers . We did n't make a huge fuss about it . For over 27 years our store has been known as a place small and independent presses would be displayed and hosted . Suffice it to say , if that 's changed at all , it is that we now strive to do so even more prominently . There 's no greater bookselling pleasure than when a small press is one of our bestsellers . Here are some titles we 've been particularly excited about :
Nathalie Leger , Suite for Barbara Loden and Leonora Carrington , The Complete Stories of Leonora Carrington
( Dorothy Project )
Article continues after advertisement
We 're half-stunned / half-excited when we meet people who have n't yet heard of the Dorothy Project . They 're not a secret anymore , garnering reviews in major publications , but their devotion to keeping it small makes them feel like a beautiful bookseller secret . Eventually , there will be tiny pop-up stores only selling their books , and it will bring down Amazonian giants ! There will be much cheering . So much has been said already about both Suite for Barbara Loden and The Complete Stories of Leonora Carrington , that all the descriptions threaten how utterly pristine they both are . Each is a tiny miracle that changes the way one sees the world .
Tyehimba Jess , Olio and Ibn Khalawayh , Names of the Lion , tr . David Larsen
( Wave Books )
Similar prize for Wave Books . Those gorgeously Spartan brave white covers catch the eye and the language within the tongue . Olio is unlike anything else I 've ever read . How often does a person get to say that ? It 's a mash-up of sonnet , song , and story , and neither the fiction nor fact of American history looks the same again . A celebration of the works , lives , and defiance of African American artists and musicians who suffered ( then and today ) minstrelizing stereotypes . It is an education and encyclopedia . Names of the Lion , appropriately , is a different beast entirely . Part cultural studies piece , part paean to translation , it is imbued with a poetry that Larsen insists was not intentional to its creator . The versatility of language faces down the regal ferocity of the lion Ibn Khalawayh identifies in their 400 epithets , and language does not blink .

Ariane Roth and Marina Schutz , Eds. , The Dynamic Library : Organizing Knowledge at the Sitterwerk—Precedents and Possibilities
( Soberscove Press , 2015 )
A collection of essays about the organization of knowledge has no right to be so compelling ! And yet , in this age where there 's so much information swirling about , organizing it is all the more imperative . There is something deeply satisfying about the rigor with which they reflect on what such an organization looks like and means , and the role of chance and change in our attempts at categorization . Such a lesson extends far beyond our bookshelves .
Meagan Day , Maximum Sunlight
( Wolfman Books , 2016 )
Meagan Day 's magnificent study of Tonopah , Nevada may not make you want to visit so much as remind you that there are so many Tonopah , Nevadas . Journalistic superstars have been made this year about the wayward eccentricities and isolationism of rural white poverty , but I would take Day 's book over just about any of them so far .
Tongo Eisen-Martin , Heaven is All Goodbyes
( City Lights Publishers , 2017 )
If you 've heard Tongo Eisen-Martin read before , it 's hard not to hear them all over again as you read their work . There is a musicality to their performance , and it 's fed by the language they put on paper . This is radical black poetry— it 's important American poetry . It 's Coltrane , Ginsberg , and Gil Scott-Heron , all alive again…having never died . It 's being human and fragile . It 's resisting arrest . It 's living and breathing against all the forces of law and order , that would prefer you 'd not .
Marie Buck , Portrait of Doom
( Krupskaya , 2015 )
We are suckers for manicured poetry , for militant poetry , for starkness … and Buck delivers . Not to say that it is simple or easy . They build these complex worlds full of anti-heroes with flecks of capitalist familiarity . It 's like glimpsing into the minds of a gang of teenagers living in an abandoned shopping mall , Wet Seal name tags still pinned to their polos . There 's an urgency here we keep returning to .
Joel Gregory & emji spero , Eds. , It 's night in San Francisco but it 's sunny in Oakland
( Timeless Infinite Light , 2014 )
This wonderful collection of East Bay poetry is like scream in the dark : “ We 're still here , dammit ! ” The techies have n't yet developed an app to make poetry obsolete , and the landlords have n't yet priced out all the poets . Anthologies become dull when they 're no longer unruly snapshots of a moment , and moments are always on the brink of passing . These sixty poets declare , “ Yes , but not yet . ”
Marjorie Muir Worthington , The Strange World of Willie Seabrook
( Spurl Editions , 2017 )
We 've likened Spurl Editions to NYRB 's neck-tattooed , wild-card of a cousin . Like so many smart small presses , they 've adopted an identifying design that captures its audience . Spurl delights in difficult figures , for whom neither sympathy nor cheering are appropriate . This is surely the case with Willie Seabrook . Their former wife chronicles their sadism , and reflects on the ability of such people to draw others into their decay .
During their career Roger Ebert took great pleasure in advising movie audiences on what films to see . They also took great pleasure panning the hell out of the ones we should stay away from . Their takedowns were legendary and more engaging than the movies they were reviewing .
They will be missed . And it 's only right that we honor their passing with the collection of their funniest burns .
The Brown Bunny , 2003
`` I had a colonoscopy once , and they let me watch it on TV . It was more entertaining than The Brown Bunny . ''
Armageddon , 1998
`` No matter what they 're charging to get in , it 's worth more to get out . ''
Spice World , 1994
`` Spice World is obviously intended as a ripoff of A Hard Day 's Night which gave The Beatles to the movies ... the huge difference , of course , is that the Beatles were talented -- while , let 's face it , the Spice Girls could be duplicated by any five women under the age of 30 standing in line at Dunkin ' Donuts . ''
Deuce Bigalow , European Gigolo , 2005
`` [ He ] makes a living prostituting himself . How much they charge I 'm not sure , but the price is worth it if it keeps them off the streets and out of another movie . ''
North , 1994
`` I hated this movie . Hated hated hated this movie . Hated it . Hated every simpering stupid vacant audience-insulting moment of it . Hated the sensibility that thought anyone would like it . Hated the implied insult to the audience by its belief that anyone would be entertained by it . ''
B.A.P.S. , 1997
`` My guess is that African Americans will be offended by the movie , and whites will be embarrassed . The movie will bring us all together , I imagine , in paralyzing boredom . ''
Crocodile Dundee In Los Angeles , 2001
`` I 've seen audits that were more thrilling . ''
Transformers : Revenge Of The Fallen , 2009
`` If you want to save yourself the ticket price , go into the kitchen , cue up a male choir singing the music of hell , and get a kid to start banging pots and pans together . Then close your eyes and use your imagination . ''
The Last Airbender , 2010
`` The Last Airbender is an agonizing experience in every category I can think of and others still waiting to be invented . ''
Stargate , 1994
`` The movie Ed Wood , about the worst director of all time , was made to prepare us for Stargate . ''
Mad Dog Time , 1996
`` Mad Dog Time is the first movie I have seen that does not improve on the sight of a blank screen viewed for the same length of time . Oh , I 've seen bad movies before . But they usually made me care about how bad they were . Watching Mad Dog Time is like waiting for the bus in a city where you 're not sure they have a bus line . ''
Beijing
In March , amid the pomp of China 's annual rubber-stamp parliament meetings in Beijing , a politician proudly shared with reporters their proposal on how to “ solve the problem of the black population in Guangdong. ” The province is widely known in China to have many African migrants .
“ Africans bring many security risks , ” Pan Qinglin told local media ( link in Chinese ) . As a member of the Chinese People 's Political Consultative Conference , the nation 's top political advisory body , they urged the government to “ strictly control the African people living in Guangdong and other places . ”
Pan , who lives in Tianjin near Beijing—and nowhere near Guangdong—held their proposal aloft for reporters to see . It read in part ( links in Chinese ) :
“ Black brothers often travel in droves ; they are out at night out on the streets , nightclubs , and remote areas . They engage in drug trafficking , harassment of women , and fighting , which seriously disturbs law and order in Guangzhou… Africans have a high rate of AIDS and the Ebola virus that can be transmitted via body fluids… If their population [ keeps growing ] , China will change from a nation-state to an immigration country , from a yellow country to a black-and-yellow country . ”
On social media , the Chinese response has been overwhelmingly supportive , with many commenters echoing Pan 's fears . In a forum dedicated to discussions about black people in Guangdong on Baidu Tieba—an online community focused on internet search results—many participants agreed that China was facing a “ black invasion. ” One commenter called on Chinese people ( link in Chinese ) not to let “ thousands of years of Chinese blood become polluted . ”
The stream of racist vitriol online makes the infamous Chinese TV ad for Qiaobi laundry detergent , which went viral last year , seem mild in comparison . The ad featured a Asian woman stuffing a black man into a washing machine to turn them into a pale-skinned Asian man .
Not about reality
Of course , while a growing number of Africans work and study in China—the African continent 's largest trading partner—the notion that black people are “ taking over ” the world 's most populous nation is nonsense . Estimates for the number of sub-Saharan Africans in Guangzhou ( nicknamed “ Chocolate City ” in Chinese ) range from 150,000 long-term residents , according to 2014 government statistics , to as high as 300,000—figures complicated by the number of Africans coming in and out of the country as well as those who overstay their visas .
Many of them partner with Chinese firms to run factories , warehouses , and export operations . Others are leaving China and telling their compatriots not to go due to financial challenges and racism .
“ Guangdong has come to be imagined to embody this racial crisis of some kind of ‘ black invasion , ' ” said Kevin Carrico , a lecturer at Macquarie University in Australia who studies race and nationalism in China . “ But this is not about actually existing realities. ” They continued :
“ It is n't so much that they dislike black residents as they dislike what they imagine about black residents . The types of discourses you see on social media sites are quite repetitive—black men raping Chinese women , black men having consensual sex with Chinese women and then leaving them , blacks as drug users and thieves destroying Chinese neighborhoods . People are living in a society that is changing rapidly . ‘ The blacks ' has become a projection point for all these anxieties in society . ”
The past year or so has seen heated debate among black people living in China about what locals think of them . In interviews with Quartz , black residents referred to online comments and racist ads as more extreme examples , but said they are symptomatic of broader underlying attitudes .
Madeleine Thiam Senegalese journalist Madeleine Thiam in Beijing .
Madeleine Thiam and Christelle Mbaya , Senegalese journalists in Beijing , said they are saddened but not shocked when they are discriminated against in China .
“ Sometimes people pinch their noses as I walk by , as if they think I smell . On the subway , people often leave empty seats next to me or change seats when I sit down , ” said Thiam . “ Women have come up to rub my skin , asking if it is ‘ dirt ' and if I 've had a shower . ”
Yet on a recent coffee break most passersby politely admired the fashionable women as if they were going down a catwalk .
One Chinese man , gazing at Thiam in their purple lace blouse and a yellow dress flaring around their hips , let out an admiring “ wow ” as the elevator doors opened to a third-floor café . Servers greeted their regulars with warm smiles and asked them in English , “ How are you ? ”
Racism or ignorance ?
Such experiences speak to the duality of life for black people in China . They may be athletes , entrepreneurs , traders , designers , or graduate students . Some are married to locals and speak fluent Chinese . Yet despite positive experiences and economic opportunities , many are questioning why they live in a place where they often feel unwelcome .
They grapple with the question : Is it racism or ignorance ? And how do you distinguish the two ?
Paolo Cesar , an African-Brazilian who has worked as a musician in Shanghai for 18 years and has a Chinese wife , said music has been a great way for them to connect with audiences and make local friends . However , their mixed-race son often comes home unhappy because of bullying at school . Despite speaking fluent Mandarin , their classmates do not accept them as Chinese . They like to shout out , “ He 's so dark ! ”
The global success of black public figures , such as politicians , actors , and athletes , appears to have a limited effect on Chinese attitudes .
“ After people heard my accent , they would often yell out ‘ Obama ! , ' in recognition that I was black American , ” said Jayne Jeje , a marketing consultant from Maryland who has worked all over mainland China and now lives in Hong Kong . “ Their perception was that I was somehow better than a black person from Africa because of my Americanness . Part of this is rooted in… mistaken beliefs of American wealth and power versus stereotypes of African poverty and suffering . ”
In response to international criticism of racism against blacks in China , some commentators have argued that the racism is not as serious as it is in other countries . Hong Kong columnist Alex Lo wrote in the South China Morning Post that criticism from Americans is “ rich coming from a country that was founded on black slavery… China has racial problems . But murderous racism against blacks is n't one of them . ”
And of course racial tensions occur elsewhere , sometimes with ethnic Chinese as the victims . In France this week , Chinese protesters gathered in northeast Paris to protest the shooting of a Chinese man by police . Many complain of racism directed against them , and also of being targeted by gangs ( video ) of North African descent .
Looking deeper into history , evidence suggests a preference for slaves from East Africa in ancient China . African slavery in the country peaked during the Tang ( 618 to 907 ) and Song ( 960 to 1279 ) dynasties .
More recently , violence broke out after the Chinese government started providing scholarships allowing African students to study in the country in the 1960s . Many Chinese students resented the stipends Africans received , with tensions culminating in riots in Nanjing in the late 1980s . The riots began with angry Chinese students surrounding African students ' dormitories in Hehai University and pelting them with rocks and bottles for seven hours , with crowds later marching through the streets shouting anti-African slogans .
In the past few years , loathing among some Chinese toward foreign men who date local women has led to a recent rise in violent attacks against foreigners .
Staying optimistic
Yet most respondents Quartz interviewed remain optimistic . Vladimir Emilien , a 26-year-old African-American actor and former varsity athlete , said that for him , learning Chinese was crucial to better interactions with locals . Emilien volunteered last year as a coach teaching Beijing youth the finer points of American football . They said that once they were able to have more complex conversations in Chinese , they were struck by the thoughtful questions locals would ask .
Vladimir Emilien Go deep .
“ They 'd say , What do you think about Chinese perception of black people ? How does that make you feel ? ' So they are aware that there is a lot of negativity around blacks and against Africa as a very poor place . ”
Emilien hopes that more interactions between Chinese and black individuals will smooth out misunderstandings . But others say that improving relations requires more than black people learning the language , since that shifts responsibility away from the Chinese .
“ The government has never done anything serious to clean up racist ideas created and populated by the [ turn-of-the-20th-century ] intellectuals and politicians that constructed a global racial hierarchy in which the whites were on the top , Chinese the second , and blacks the bottom , ” said Cheng Yinghong , a history professor at Delaware State University who researches nationalism and discourse of race in China .
Instead of addressing discrimination , the Chinese government has focused on promoting cultural exchanges while pursuing economic partnerships with African countries . However , many have pointed out that relationships appear unbalanced , with China taking Africa 's limited natural resources in exchange for infrastructure investment .
“ Racism is racism , period , and although some people would say that in different places it is more explicit , nuanced , or implicit , as long as there are victims we have to call it racism and deal with it , ” said Adams Bodomo , a professor of African studies focused on cross-cultural communication at the University of Vienna . “ China ca n't be the second-largest economy in the world and not expect to deal with these issues . ”

Introduced ten years after the original Series I Jaguar E-Type made its debut at the Geneva Motor Salon the Jaguar E-Type Series III was a development of the original classic car but with changes that were in part desirable , such as the new all alloy V12 engine , and in part imposed by government regulation . Jaguar weathered the challenges of keeping ahead of an ever more demanding marketplace , and keeping up with the ever increasing demands of government regulators and built the Series III car as one that stayed as faithful as possible to the original classic design . In doing so they created a car that was arguably as beautiful as its forebears but with a more purposeful style , better handling , more stable at very high speeds , and a car that possessed an enormous potential for an owner to tweak it up into a subtle embodiment of raw power that growls like the big cat it is . For an example of the sort of tweaking that the Series III E-Type lends itself to watch the following drive video ( courtesy Pat Harmon ) and have a look at the power and modifications listed at the end .
The stock standard E-Type Series III V12 sounds beautiful and smooth but the above video provides a glimpse of what can be had if desired . The decision to create a V12 was made to ensure the Jaguar cars being exported to the United States were technically advanced and competitive with the V8 engines that were so common in the States . By creating a V12 the Jaguar E-Type Series III enjoyed all the benefits of having an engine with near perfect balance and smooth , even delivery of power and torque . The development of the engine was entrusted to Walter Hassan ( who had been instrumental in the creation of the V12 's predecessor the XK engine ) and Harry Mundy . In the video below Walter Hassan and Harry Mundy explain their design decisions in the creation of the Jaguar V12 . ( Courtesy King Rose Archives ) .
The new V12 engine was fitted with Lucas transistorized ignition and in original tune produced 272hp breathing through four Zenith carburettors . Later production cars had this reduced to just over 250hp as the emissions control rules required . With the aluminum V12 under their hood the Series III was capable of better acceleration than their predecessors being able to accelerate to 100mph in 16seconds . Standing to 60mph was accomplished in less than seven seconds , Top speed was 135mph with the standard textile radial tires fitted and 8mph faster at 143mph with optional steel belted radial tires . Many owners modified their cars to improve on these performance figures as we have already seen in the first video .
The Series III Jaguar E-Type was only made in the roadster and 2+2 couple versions . the shorter wheelbase two seater hard top was dropped simply because the 2+2 was so much more popular and eliminating the model made production of the Series III easier . The Series III cars needed some styling changes in order to accommodate the V12 engine . the most noticeable of these was the enlarging of the front air intake and provision of an additional air scoop underneath it . These changes altered the look of the car but were necessary to provide the needed cooling for the new larger engine .
The new V12 had a number of other practical improvements to go with its new look . The front disc brakes were upgraded to ventilated type and the suspension was made anti-dive . Power steering by Adwest was fitted as standard and an automatic transmission was available as an option . The track was increased necessitating flared wheel arches giving the car an even more stable and sporting look whilst at the rear the car was fitted with a quadruple exhaust through which to play its V12 engine music .
The interior of the Series III E-Type was wisely kept visually the same as on the previous models with large tachometer and speedometer immediately in front of the driver and with the four other gauges arranged in a neat line at the center of the dashboard with a row of rocker switches underneath them .
The Series III E-Type had become a touring sports car in the Grand Touring style and is a more comfortable and more capable car than the models that preceded it despite its more aggressive and slightly less classic looks .
The 1973 Jaguar E-Type Series III in our pictures is coming up for sale by Bonhams at their Spa Classic Sale to be held at Le circuit de Spa Francorchamps , Route de Circuit , 55 , 4970 Francorchamps on 21st May 2017 .
You will find the sale page for this car with full details if you click here .
This Jaguar is a two owner car with 43,700 miles on the tachometer and is in excellent condition . The car is fitted with air conditioning and a stainless steel exhaust system . It certainly looks to be a prime example of the model .

I was trying to do a bit of research into the influence of New Wave on cross-over dance music in the Mid-Eighties , but I found `` 1984 '' a complete waste of time ... Jackson 's `` Thriller '' ? ( the soundtrack of the summer , and the biggest selling album of all-time ) - not mentioned ; Frankie Goes To Hollywood ( their breakthrough year leading to world pop domination ) - not a whisper ; Style Council ? ( Not Paul Weller 's finest hour , but still an honest nod to the white soul roots of Mod culture ) - you 'd have thought they did n't exist if you read this book . Nik Kershaw ? Ray Parker Junior ? Sister Sledge ? Nope , nope nope . Instead this man seems to have moped around in their room and at work , watching some kind of depressing news channel ( was their remote broken ? This is n't explained - but you 'd have thought they 'd have had MTV on at least one of the channels in their office ) . Orwell completely fails to capture the uplifting vibe that was the pop explosion of the summer of '84 ... maybe they lived in Norwood . 0 Stars .
Oh , and do n't read `` the Road to Wigan Pier '' either , as we drove around for ages last August Bank Holiday before asking a traffic warden , who said that the sea was about 30 miles away , by which time it was too late . I do n't think Orwell had actually ever been to Wigan . What do they do - just sit in their room making this stuff up for kicks or something ? 0 stars also . ''
DO N'T KNOW NOTHIN'….On NPR this weekend , White House press secretary Dana Perino recounted a recent press briefing in which a reporter referred to the Cuban Missile Crisis :
“ I was panicked a bit because I really do n't know about . . . the Cuban Missile Crisis , ” said Perino , who at 35 was born about a decade after the 1962 U.S.-Soviet nuclear showdown . “ It had to do with Cuba and missiles , I 'm pretty sure. ” So they consulted their best source . “ I came home and I asked my husband , ” they recalled . “ I said , ‘ Was n't that like the Bay of Pigs thing ? ' And they said , ‘ Oh , Dana . ' “
Italics mine . I thought it was only the kids who did n't know any history these days ?
NB : JFK , of course , is famous for resisting military advice during the Cuban Missile Crisis from insane hawks like Curtis LeMay . Not knowing anything about this probably helps Perino fit right in to the Bush White House .
I asked them what they meant . “ Anywhere . A restaurant , going to mass with my fiancee . Everywhere . It used to be I had to see everything and everyone where I was or I could n't be in any public place . ”
Lacey 's been out of prison for seven years now : “ It 's only been the last few years that I 've been able to sit in a chair that is n't in the corner of the room furthest from the door and with my back to the wall . ”
By the time they were released , they had developed a secondary personality . I asked them to describe as best they could what that alternate version of them was . They said , “ It 's like , uh , a body guard or security guard . They watch every corner of the room and is always aware of 100 percent of their surroundings . ”
Initially not knowing how long he 'd be in “ the hole ” they said they began rehearsing what they would do if they were attacked when they got out . Days passed , then months , then several years went by . Each day , every hour… every few minutes even , their mind would re-visit the same defensive moves over , and over , and over again . They kept track of the time between their meals and the hours until theirs mandated 1-hour walk in a 3-foot-by-8-foot cage for “ recreational ” time — again , by himself .
I took one of my employees to lunch several months ago . They spent from age 20 through their 27th birthday in solitary confinement . I asked them over our meal , “ What was it like to be alone for that long ? ”
Psychiatrists and psychologists who have spent decades studying exactly this have never been able to articulate the damage accurately . They say it 's too extensive to quantitate and exponentially lowers the possibility of successful rehabilitation in the future .
In a study of inmates at California 's Pelican Bay State Prison , psychologist Craig Haney found that prisoners “ lose the ability to initiate or to control their own behavior , or to organize their own lives. ” Haney , a professor at the University of California at Santa Cruz , attributed this loss to the near total lack of control that prisoners have over their day-to-day lives in solitary .
A 2003 report by Human Rights Watch found that anywhere from one-fifth to two-thirds of prisoners in solitary confinement are believed to have some form of mental illness . That 's 20 percent to 30 percent .
In one notorious study from the 1950s , University of Wisconsin psychologist Harry Harlow placed rhesus monkeys inside a custom-designed solitary chamber nicknamed “ the pit of despair. ” After a day or two , Harlow wrote , “ most subjects typically assume a hunched position in a corner of the bottom of the apparatus . One might presume at this point that they find their situation to be hopeless. ” Harlow also found that monkeys kept in isolation wound up “ profoundly disturbed , given to staring blankly and rocking in place for long periods , circling their cages repetitively , and mutilating themselves. ” Most re-adjusted eventually , but not those that had been caged the longest . “ Twelve months of isolation almost obliterated the animals socially , ” Harlow found .
In 1951 , researchers at McGill University paid a group of male graduate students to stay in small chambers equipped with only a bed for an experiment on sensory deprivation . They could leave to use the bathroom , but that 's all . They wore goggles and earphones to limit their sense of sight and hearing , and gloves to limit their sense of touch . The plan was to observe students for six weeks , but not one lasted more than seven days . Nearly every student lost the ability “ to think clearly about anything for any length of time , ” while several others began to suffer hallucinations . “ One man could see nothing but dogs , ” wrote one of the study 's collaborators , “ another nothing but eyeglasses of various types , and so on . ”
In May 2015 , the prison population in Arkansas had exceeded 18,000 inmates housed in both Arkansas Department of Correction facilities and the county jail back-up . Take a look at the Arkansas prison population growth chart below .
The following is from a report commissioned by ADC and can be found on their website :
“ According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics , Arkansas ' incarceration rate in 2013 , 578 prisoners per 100,000 state residents , exceeded the national rate of 417 . It is important to note that the national incarceration rate used for this report is based on offenders held in state prisons only and does not include federal prisoners or persons held in jails . ”
Then in September 2015 , a report was released by Yale University in cooperation with the Association of State Correctional Administrators that showed Arkansas has the highest percentage of male inmates in solitary confinement in the country — 7.5 percent of the Arkansas ' nearly 14,000 male inmates are held in “ administrative segregation , ” or in isolation , for 22 to 23 hours a day for 30 days or more .
What Value Does Solitary Confinement Have for Our Justice System ?
This is when we have to ask ourselves the question : What value does solitary confinement have for our justice system ? If the corrections department is to correct behavior , what role does irreparable damage have in correcting undesirable behaviors ? I would venture to say the majority of educated adults if pushed to answer this question would concede it should n't play a role . Most would be hard-pressed to find an alternative to disciplinary action for violent individuals , however .
Below are a few points from a report titled , “ Mississippi 's Experience Rethinking Prison Classification and Creating Alternative Mental Health Programs . ”
The development of an objective criterion for placement in administrative segregation ( solitary confinement )
A mandate that prisoners in Mississippi may be held in administrative segregation only if they have committed serious infractions , are active high-level members of a gang or have prior escapes or escape attempts from a secure facility
A process mandating a 90-day review for all prisoners in administrative segregation and a written case plan for each prisoner specifying what he/she must do to gain release from administrative segregation .
The creation of a step-down unit for those prisoners in need of mental health facilities which would function alongside the Mississippi Department of Corrections
What you see here is that Mississippi developed a system of intentionality that is critically absent among so many correctional systems . Reform has to come from the decision to implement change , which is what they did so their prison population was no longer tortured and left mangled by the devastation solitary confinement inevitably brings on any human subjected to it 's unforgiving punishment . Here is a link to that article .
Lukas Muntingh , co-founder of the Civil Society Prison Reform Initiative writes :
“ The way prisoners are treated , and their experience of their rights , shape and reflect on constructs of offenders , punishment , use of force , dignity and the duty of the state to provide care . These constructs are not static ; they are continuously moulded and reshaped by the current discourse . This fluidity can not be left unchecked in a constitutional democracy . ”
This is taken straight from the Arkansas Department of Correction Administrative Directive issued on Jan. 17 , 2014 :
“ D . Review of Administrative Segregation – Status 1 .
The Classification Committee or authorized staff must review the status of every inmate assigned to administrative segregation classification every seven ( 7 ) days for the first two months , and every thirty ( 30 ) days thereafter to determine if the reason ( s ) for placement continue to exist . At every other , of these 30-day reviews , the inmate will be personally interviewed by the Classification Committee or authorized staff . All reviews will be documented utilizing the appropriate segregation form . ”
Unfortunately this neither answers to the power of nor minimizes the uses of solitary confinement effectively enough . One study from the American Journal of Public Health , found that “ inmates ever assigned to solitary confinement were 3.2 times as likely to commit an act of self-harm per 1000 days at some time during their incarceration as those never assigned to solitary . ”
Arkansas needs tighter restrictions , more oversight and specific rules for the application of solitary confinement in our state 's prison and jail system . We can not continue this practice as freely as we have done and continue to do to this day .
Federal Judge Blocks Obama Administration 's Overtime Pay Rule
Enlarge this image toggle caption Pablo Martinez Monsivais/AP Pablo Martinez Monsivais/AP
With just over a week before it was scheduled to take effect , a federal judge has blocked the implementation of an Obama administration rule that would have extended overtime eligibility to some 4 million Americans .
The Labor Department 's sweeping overhaul to the overtime rule required employers to pay time-and-a-half to their employees who worked more than 40 hours in a given week and earned less than $ 47,476 a year .
That salary threshold is about twice what currently allows workers to be exempted from overtime . As NPR 's White House Correspondent Scott Horsley told our Newscast Unit , supporters of the rule called it `` long overdue '' as inflation took its toll on overtime protection .
`` The rule was one of the administration 's most far-reaching efforts to boost pay for workers at the lower end of the income ladder . It 's one of many administrative actions that was already facing the threat of reversal from the incoming Trump administration . ''
The measure , which had been set to take effect Dec. 1 , was intended to send a jolt to slow-growing U.S. incomes .
On Tuesday , U.S. District Judge Amos Mazzant III issued a preliminary injunction in the case , siding with plaintiffs who said the new overtime rules would have caused an uptick in government costs in their states and made it mandatory for businesses to pay millions in additional salaries . Business groups said the new rule changes would have eventually led to layoffs .
The timing of the block brings an early answer for workers who were wondering about the rule 's fate after the election . As NPR 's Business Correspondent Yuki Noguchi reported earlier this month :
`` In any presidential transition , previous policies are subject to review . Trump has pledged to undo President Obama 's executive orders , dismantle the Affordable Care Act , reverse policies on clean air , immigration and on Dodd-Frank financial reform . This [ month ] , the Congressional Budget Office said canceling the overtime rule would reduce employers ' compliance costs and boost profits , a point advocates refute . This leaves businesses wondering how they should proceed on rules that might be unwound . ''
With Republicans controlling both houses in Congress and the Trump administration set to take office in less than two months , the new overtime rule 's long-term future remains in limbo .
The Department of Labor issued the following statement regarding the federal court 's preliminary injunction .
`` We strongly disagree with the decision by the court , which has the effect of delaying a fair day 's pay for a long day 's work for millions of hardworking Americans . The department 's overtime rule is the result of a comprehensive , inclusive rulemaking process , and we remain confident in the legality of all aspects of the rule . We are currently considering all of our legal options . ''
Here is the full court document :
CHARLOTTE , N.C. -- After 19 straight wins and an NBA record 27-2 start , the Boston Celtics have lost that swagger .
The lockdown defense and the poise are missing , too , as teams line up to get a shot at the defending champions .
On Tuesday , it was the lowly Charlotte Bobcats , as Raymond Felton scored 25 points and rookie D.J . Augustin added 11 of their 20 in overtime in a stunning 114-106 win that sent the Celtics to their fifth loss in seven games .
Going from unbeatable to vulnerable in less than two weeks , the Celtics were searching for answers after being left battered , bruised and angry by Larry Brown 's upstart Bobcats .
`` We told our team before the season it will be 82 Game 7s . Every time we play it 's a Game 7 for the other team , '' coach Doc Rivers said . `` On the nights we 're not ready mentally for that , we 're going to have to get lucky and play over our head to win . ''
It did n't happen against Charlotte , and there was plenty of blame to go around .
Paul Pierce scored 28 points , but had a key turnover in overtime . Ray Allen scored 20 points , but shot 7-for-20 . Rajon Rondo committed nine turnovers . Kevin Garnett had 14 points and 13 rebounds , but shot only 7-of-18 and was called for traveling in Charlotte 's decisive spurt .
And the NBA 's worst offensive team had its second-best scoring night of the season . Gerald Wallace chipped in with 23 points , but it was Augustin who hit a 3-pointer and two free throws in a 7-0 run that put Charlotte ahead 108-101 .
Augustin even talked some trash at the champs ' expense .
`` They come in and intimidate you and try to punk you , '' Augustin said . `` But if you do n't back down from them , they kind of fold . ''
That would have been laughable before Boston visited the Lakers on Christmas . But Boston was frustrated again at key times .
After Pierce dribbled the ball out of bounds with Charlotte leading by five in the final minute of OT , Pierce gave Augustin a slight shove , as the turnover ended Boston 's chances in a physical game that saw the Celtics continue their surprising struggles against one of the Eastern Conference 's worst teams .
The Bobcats , despite entering with a 44-72 record over the past two seasons , won in Boston last season . They lost on Allen 's buzzer-beater in another game , and dropped a close contest in the first meeting this season in November .
Tuesday was another thriller , as the Celtics rallied from a 10-point , third-quarter deficit , took 79-72 lead in the fourth quarter , then allowed the Bobcats to get back in it .
Felton 's fadeaway with 38 seconds left in regulation put Charlotte ahead 96-95 . After Allen missed a jumper , Felton was fouled and hit only one free throw with 20 seconds left .
Pierce then dribbled off a screen and drilled a turnaround jumper with 3.4 seconds left to tie it . Felton missed a straightaway 20-footer at the buzzer to force OT .
But the Bobcats dominated the extra period , despite playing again without Raja Bell ( groin ) , getting five straight defensive stops to pick up one of Brown 's biggest wins since taking over their record ninth NBA team .
`` The one thing I always remember is when you 're a good team , every team you play against is trying to bring their best game , '' Brown said . `` That 's a pretty special group that Boston has . We 've got to learn to bring it every night like that and not just against Boston . ''
The Celtics were without reserve guard Tony Allen , who injured their right ankle in Sunday 's loss to New York , and again looked out of sync in a bruising game .
As Bobcats part-owner Michael Jordan sat courtside and spent much of the game barking at referee Dick Bavetta , there were angry words and blood on the court .
Charlotte 's Juwan Howard picked up a flagrant foul for leveling Glen Davis early in the fourth quarter , leading Davis to play with cotton in one nostril .
Technicals were called on Rivers and Felton , after they confronted Davis following a hard foul away from the ball .
`` We 'll get better , '' Garnett promised . `` We 're a team of confidence , a team of character . We 're just getting everybody 's best shot right now .
Game notes
Brown said Bell would also miss Wednesday 's game in Cleveland , but could return Friday in Philadelphia . ... Bobcats F Adam Morrison had 13 points in their best game in a month . ... The Bobcats made 31 of 34 free throws , with Augustin and Wallace combining to make all 20 attempts . ... Rivers reminisced before the game about playing for Brown and their complex offensive system in the 1991-92 season with the Clippers . `` The attention to detail . ... It opened my eyes to a lot of stuff , '' said Rivers , who acknowledged they now make the same demands on their players about spacing and setting proper screens .

Traditional . Queen . Tea . Castles . These are probably a few of the words that come to mind when England is mentioned .
But are we wrong to stereotype the country in such a manner ?
During my recent trip to the Mother Country , I was reminded that it is with good reason England is associated with these words . They love the Queen , they know how to do tea right ( cream tea anyone ? ) , and the country is not lacking for castles .
And it 's absolutely splendid . Splendid I thought .

When Jack Lew was appointed chief of staff to President Obama in January , many in the Jewish community wondered how they could observe Shabbat in such a demanding position .
Luckily , Lew has the most powerful man in the world to keep track of time as the sun starts to dip low in the sky on Friday afternoons .
“ I saw the president on many occasions on Friday afternoons look at their watch , and ask : ‘ Is n't it time for you to get going ? ' ” Lew said , “ or , ‘ Why are you still here ? ' The president was not checking the clock “ because they do n't think I can keep time , ” Lew said . Rather , the extra care on this issue reflects the President 's wish “ to remind me that it 's important to him , not just to me , that I be able to make that balance . ”
Lew , who is Orthodox , revealed the details about theirs keeping Shabbat in an extraordinary interview with the Forward that touched on their need to observe the Jewish holy day .
“ And he 's respected that time and again , ” the chief of staff said of Obama .
This story `` Jack Lew 's Shabbat Helper '' was written by Nathan Guttman .
The chief of staff noted it was Obama who brought up the issue of Shabbat when first offering Lew the job .
“ He raised it with me saying : ‘ I know that things are going to come up where there 's an emergency on Saturday or that you need to be here . I know you well enough to know that this is not an issue . I want you to know that I 'm never going to ask you to work on Saturday if it 's not really necessary . It 's important for me that you know that . ' ”
On their behalf , Lew provided the President with their own assurances .
“ I 've made it clear , ” Lew said , “ that you do n't have to wonder if there 's a crisis whether I 'm available . If you need me , I do n't even consider it a violation of my faith to be doing the things I need to do to make sure people are not in harm 's way . ”
In practice , this arrangement has worked out well . On Fridays , Lew leaves the White House before Shabbat begins and they are off on Saturdays . In the cases where their presence was needed on Shabbat , the chief of staff usually walked to the White House and back .
Rabbis they consulted with assured Lew that when there is a real necessity , Jewish tradition approves of working on the Sabbath . The number of times Lew actually had to work on Saturday has been “ limited , ” they said .
Lew had dealt with the potential conflicts between observing Shabbat and working in top level positions under President Bill Clinton , when they served as the White House budget director . Clinton made sure not to have their top budget adviser busy from sundown Friday to the end of Saturday , and Lew made themselves available when emergencies occurred .
“ I have found that if you are true to your own beliefs , people respect it , ” Lew said . “ I 've found that President Obama considers it a sign of strength and value that there is something in my life that reflects principles that I adhere to . ”
What is the Dirtiest Restaurant in NYC ?
Like on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Google+ Share on LinkedIn Pin to Pinterest Share on StumbleUpon +
To celebrate the much controversial new NYC restaurant letter grading on cleanliness , we decided to check out what restaurants are most likely to get a bad grade . If you have n't heard , as of July 2010 , the New York City Health Department will require restaurants to post sanitation letter grades on a front window ( or door ) so that people may easily see it . This is the breakdown :
Grade A . 0 to 13 points for sanitary violations .
Grade B . 14 to 27 points for sanitary violations .
Grade C. 28 or more points for sanitary violations .
If the infractions are deemed to be a health hazard , the restaurants are immediately closed down by the city ( no letter grade , just closed ) . Restaurants that receive a grade of C will be re-inspected in 3 to 5 months so they have time to make the appropriate changes . The letter grading system seems to have worked in California , where restaurants were pretty much shamed into cleaning up their act and it reduced food borne illness by 20 % .
According to the NYC Department of Health Website , these are the top offenders where it was so bad the restaurants closed . I 've included one sample of each of the restaurant 's many violations . ( Surprisingly the infamous Taco Bell/KFC with the rats did not make the list ) :
296 Points – La Vega : 103-07 Roosevelt Avenue , Queens . “ No Facilities available to wash , rinse and sanitize utensils and/or equipment ” .
154 Points – Bella Luna : 55 W 55th Street , Manhattan . “ Evidence of /or live mice in facility 's food and/or non food areas ”
143 Points – Cooper Fish and Seafood : 201-03 Linden Blvd , Queens . “ Facility not vermin proof . Harboarage or conditions conductive to vermin infestation exist ” .
114 Points – Spanish Buffet : 95 Stuyvesant Place , Staten Island . “ Pesticide use not in accordance with label or applicable laws . Prohibited chemical used/stored . Open bait station used .
112 Points – Los Caudillos Restaurant : 3712 13th Ave , Brooklyn . “ Evidence of , or live roaches ( and mice ) in facility 's food and/or nonfood areas ” .
These guys are still open and were given a chance to clean up their act :
99 Points – La Familia : 334 East Gunhill Road , Bronx .
98 Points – Mars 212 : 1633 Broadway , Manhattan .
97 Points – El Rey : 147-13 Hillside Ave. , Queens .
96 Points – Food Court : 000 Fordham Plaza , Bronx .
94 Points ( We have a three way tie here ) – St. Best Jerk Spot ( 112-31 Springfield Blvd. , Queens ) , New Hane Sushi ( 581B 3rd Ave. , Manhattan ) and Don Alex III B ( 32-15 Junction Blvd. , Queens ) .
To check out the complete list of offenders ( and there over 700 of them ) just head to the NYC Department of Health Website , it is a great resource that can keep you healthy , happy and eating .

Hillary Clinton makes a stop at the Lincoln Square pancake house in Indianapolis on May 1 . ( Photo : Joe Raedle/Getty Images )
If you want to experience the full-on contempt of the leftist intelligentsia right now , go on social media and suggest , as I did this week , that Donald Trump is n't certain to get crushed in November . ( Trump , in case you had n't noticed , brings out pretty much the worst in everybody . )
The way a lot of partisan Democrats see it , Hillary Clinton — despite a loss to Bernie Sanders in Indiana Tuesday — will soon lock down their party 's nomination , and the only way they find themselves even threatened by Trump is if the media decides to legitimize them so we all have something to talk about . The word I keep hearing from liberals is “ layup . ”
Clinton does , in fact , enter the general election season with some serious structural advantages . Having analyzed trends from the past six elections and factored in demographic shifts , Third Way , the leading centrist Democratic group , concluded that Clinton starts the campaign virtually assured of 237 electoral votes — 46 more than Trump and just 33 short of a majority .
And as you 've probably heard , no candidate has ever overcome — or even tried to overcome — the kind of ugly impressions Trump has made on women and minority voters to this point . Next to him , Clinton polls like Santa Claus .
But if history is any guide , Clinton comes to the campaign with a structural disadvantage , too , and one that should n't be overlooked . It may explain why they ca n't seem to put Bernie Sanders away — and why the outcome in November is hardly assured .
I 've gone through this history once or twice before , but it bears repeating : In 1947 , Congress passed the 22nd Amendment , which said no one could be elected to the presidency more than twice .
In the 65 years since the last state ratified that amendment — comprising 16 elections , and six elections following an eight-year presidency — only one nominee has managed to win a third consecutive term for their party . That was George H.W . Bush , who overcame a double-digit deficit late in the campaign , thanks in part to one of the most ineffectual Democratic campaigns in history .
( And before you start with me , I know , Al Gore actually won , and in an alternate universe somewhere they are building their monument on the Tidal Basin in a climate that is , on average , four degrees cooler than the one we inhabit , but for purposes of this discussion , let 's just live in the here and now . )
The important question is why it 's proved so difficult for either side to win third terms . The most common explanation has to do with voter fatigue . Essentially , we 're told that voters get sick of having one party in office for eight years , and so the pendulum swings back .
I do n't find this theory especially persuasive . I 've met an awful lot of voters over the years , and rarely have I heard anyone make the case that it was time for the other party to get a turn . It seems to me voters focus a lot more on the candidates themselves than on the parties they represent .
And this may get to the truer cause of the third-term conundrum . If you look back at elections over the past half century , what you find is that the parties of two-term incumbents almost always nominate the candidate who is nominally next in line . Of the six candidates who have sought third terms since 1960 , five had previously served as either president or vice president . ( The president was Gerald Ford , who ran for election in 1976 after having held the job for two-plus years . )
The outlier was John McCain , who , like Clinton , had been the runner-up in the last open election , and who ran in a year when the incumbent vice president was sitting it out .
It 's not hard to see how this happens . A two-term president has both the time and the muscle to set up someone who will carry on their legacy — while effectively boxing out challengers .
And because presidents almost always lose congressional seats and governorships in off-year elections , an eight-year presidency tends to decimate the ranks of worthy , younger successors from outside the establishment , anyway .
The Internet blackouts to protest the pending Stop Online Piracy Act and Protect Intellectual Property Act legislation currently working their way through the U.S. House and Senate have ignited a much-needed discussion of the question of censorship in the United States — though the discussion ought to go much further than it has so far .
One of the most striking things about the debate around SOPA and PIPA , in fact , is that the question of censorship has drawn as much attention as it has partly because it is a byproduct of a battle pitting one set of American corporate interests against another : those who generate “ content ” against those who maintain the electronic infrastructure in which creative material ( copyrighted and otherwise ) can be produced , disseminated and accessed . Or , to be slightly more reductive about it , the struggle pits Hollywood ( the Motion Picture Association of America , the Directors Guild , American Federation of Musicians , etc . ) against Silicon Valley ( Google , eBay , Facebook , Yahoo , etc. ) . It 's little wonder that the Electronic Frontier Foundation went so far as to say that SOPA finally gives Hollywood “ a chance to break the Internet , ” since that is how the legislative campaign is being pitched .

Ordinarily these kinds of arguments between powerful interests might simply be read by the rest of us with a sense of philosophical detachment — even , perhaps , as compelling evidence of the ongoing contradiction between what Marx once distinguished as the means and the relations of production , or in other words the gap that sometimes opens up between sheer technological capabilities and the social systems in which they are embedded , which , at pivotal moments ( including our own ) , seem to impede technological innovation .
But in this case one set of corporations has been able to develop an alliance with those who advocate for free speech as a matter of intellectual and political principle rather than simply as a matter of corporate interest . And , indeed , even if , say , eBay 's credentials for ( let alone commitment to ) fighting censorship and advocating free speech are , to say the least , highly debatable , this battle among corporate titans does indeed have implications for the rest of us . At some point , the requirements of certain forms of commercial freedom actually do blend with those of intellectual and cultural freedom more generally .
That detestable — and yet so easily bandied-about — word , “ content , ” which is at the center of this debate , refers to the products of human creativity , and , for better as well as for worse , the Internet has become one of the main structures for the creation and dissemination of creative energies in our age , so anything that might interrupt or cut off altogether the flow of that energy is , or ought to be , cause for concern .
The consensus among critics of SOPA is that , even if the intention ( which is , of course , hard or even impossible to actually scrutinize ) of the legislation is not , in itself , to impose a censorship regime , that will be the end result . As Rebecca MacKinnon argues , the legislation would allow the attorney general to generate a blacklist of sites to be blocked by Internet service providers and search engines , without a judicial order , much less a trial . SOPA would allow companies to sue service providers for hosting material that supposedly infringes copyright , even if they do so unknowingly . This would force ISPs and websites to monitor user activity , which is to say , to censor it , necessarily erring on the side of caution . As CNET notes , the language of the bill could be used to blacklist the next YouTube or Wikipedia — not to mention already existing sites like WikiLeaks .
What is missing from much of the salutary anti-censorship activism around SOPA and PIPA , however , is a sense of where the legislation fits in amid other recent efforts in the U.S. to curtail freedom of speech and intellectual freedom more generally .
For legal efforts to curb intellectual freedom are an ever-present — indeed , even a mounting — threat . And what is at stake in these efforts is far more than merely “ content ” and the rights or legal obligations of Internet giants like Twitter and YouTube : It is the very freedom of expression that is vital to our intellectual as well as cultural life .

Probably the most visible recent examples of these legal efforts are the ever more persistent attempts by American supporters of Israel to use legislation , legal procedures and government bureaucracies to suppress free and open debate about Israel/Palestine on campuses across the country by , among other things , attempting to falsely conflate principled criticism of Israeli policy with anti-Semitism .
This effort has led , most recently , to the filing of a lawsuit against the University of California at Berkeley , and lobbying the U.S. Department of Education to open a formal investigation of the University of California at Santa Cruz , as well as undertaking a similar investigation at Barnard College in New York . Yes , the Berkeley lawsuit was recently dismissed by a judge , as was the Barnard investigation . These are welcome signs of judicial independence .
But other lawsuits that aim to chill open debate on campus , most notoriously in the trial of 11 U.C . Irvine and U.C . Riverside Muslim students who were found guilty of engaging in a campus protest , have been successful . No doubt other such attempts will be made in the future . This bundle of efforts is only the most recent incarnation of a variety of ideological projects over the past several years to impose different kinds of censorship on college campuses — which are , inevitably , key nodes for the production and circulation of ideas in the country .
Perhaps the most visible of those efforts was the campaign David Horowitz led in the early- to mid-2000s to impose state monitoring of universities , including intruding into such pedagogical matters as text assignments and course syllabi , and even coercing instructors into teaching specific points of view — all under the Orwellian banner of “ student rights. ” At one point , up to a dozen state legislatures were considering the Horowitz package .

At the federal level , legislation calling for the same top-down monitoring was ( with the help of neoconservative and pro-Israel lobbyists ) actually pushed through the U.S. House of Representatives in the form of HR 3077 , which was designed to establish government monitoring of federally funded international studies programs at universities across the country , to check that their programs and curricula reflect “ national needs related to homeland security . ”
Some may take solace from the collapse of the Horowitz campaign and the demise of HR 3077 . That would be premature , if not unwise . As more recent events attest , the same will to use the law to censor and silence dissenting viewpoints has not been abandoned — it has merely shifted form .
What these disturbing events have in common is the turn to legislation , to use the bureaucracy and the law on behalf of powerful interests who seem to have something to fear in the kinds of open exchange that are inseparable from a democratic society . It is important for those who are against SOPA and PIPA to see the connection of their cause in the commercial realm with the wider suppression of intellectual and cultural freedom that is taking place as we seem to hear what the poet William Blake once referred to as “ mind-forg 'd manacles ” clamping shut all around us .
BOSTON -- The Boston Red Sox have acquired Chicago Cubs outfielder Marlon Byrd and cash for reliever Michael Bowden and a player to be named later .
Byrd broke the news of their own trade to ESPNChicago.com 's Bruce Levine , with the clubs both announcing the deal officially Saturday night .
The 35-year-old outfielder , who has also played for the Philadelphia Phillies , Washington Nationals and Texas Rangers , is an 11-year veteran and experienced center fielder with a .278 batting average . But they had just three hits in their first 43 at-bats with the Cubs this season ( .070 ) , with no extra-base hits and 10 strikeouts .
`` He 's been a good major league center fielder for a long time and he 's off to a tough start , '' said Red Sox general manager Ben Cherington , who spoke with reporters late Saturday night . `` Our hope is that a change of scenery and in a new environment we can get them going to help us and give ( manager ) Bobby ( Valentine ) another option in the outfield . ''
The Cubs will send cash covering nearly all of Byrd 's pro-rated $ 6.5 million salary . To make room for Byrd on the roster , the Sox designated Nate Spears for assignment .
Byrd did not play in Chicago 's game against the Cincinnati Reds on Saturday afternoon .
The trade took on added urgency when Red Sox outfielder Jason Repko went down with what Valentine described as a slight separation of their left shoulder , an injury incurred when Repko ran into the center-field wall Friday .
Cubs GM Jed Hoyer said Repko 's injury did not directly lead to the trade .
`` No , we 've been talking to them since the end of spring training , '' Hoyer said in a conference call with Chicago media . `` We 've been trying to get relief pitching . In trading Marlon we felt we had outfield depth with some young guys that can play the position . ''
The Red Sox already have two elite outfielders on the disabled list , Jacoby Ellsbury and Carl Crawford . Repko was projected as a stopgap until Crawford 's return , which is believed to be still a couple of weeks away .
`` Obviously with Ellsbury out and Crawford still coming back , we felt there was a need to add to the outfield , '' Cherington said . `` I think they know they have to come in and perform to play , but it 's a fresh start and I think he 's excited to be here and we 're excited to have him . ''
Cherington acknowledged the difficulty of finding outside help at this time of year , which explains in part why the Sox are adding a player who has performed this season as poorly as Byrd has to date .
`` We do n't think their performance so far this year is reflective of who they are -- he 's been a pretty consistent performer -- but teams are not anxious to give away good players this time of year , players who are helping them and are part of their future . It 's a challenging time to make trades , but we felt this was a good fit for the team , made sense for the Cubs and Red Sox , and hope Marlon can help us . ''
Last May 21 , Byrd was struck near the left eye by a pitch by Red Sox reliever Alfredo Aceves and sustained multiple facial fractures , missing 39 games . At the time they were hurt , Byrd had posted a .308/.346/.419 line . After returning July 2 , Byrd hit .255/.311/.380 for the rest of the season .
`` He came back pretty quickly from it and performed pretty well when they first came back , '' Cherington said , when asked about the impact of the beaning . `` And then they tailed off a little bit at the end of the season . I do n't know . It 's hard for me to answer that one . But physically , he 's fine , he 's passed all the tests . From a scouting standpoint , there 's no obvious change in skills except their performance has n't been there .
`` We get to know them better when they get here and we get them in the lineup and try to get them going . ''
Bowden was once regarded as a promising prospect , first as a starter , then as a reliever , with brief stints in the majors in each of the last four seasons . But the Red Sox designated them for assignment on April 15 , even though they have the highest earned run average in the major leagues .
`` This underscores ( Bowden 's ) slow start , '' Hoyer said . `` Small samples should n't cloud your opinion on a player . We 've known them since 2005 . He 's a local kid . I know he 's excited to be coming to Chicago . ''
Microsoft announced today that it is introducing a new premium membership program for Xbox One that will give players instant access to scores of digital games , and Wall Street is viewing that move as somewhat hostile toward one of the world 's biggest gaming retailers .
GameStop 's stock price has dropped nearly 8 percent today following Xbox boss Phil Spencer revealing the Xbox Game Pass service . This is a program where Xbox One owners can pay $ 10 per month to have unlimited access to over 100 Xbox One and backward-compatible Xbox 360 games . Of course , these are all digital games that you download from Microsoft 's Xbox Game Store , and it 's likely that investors are seeing this as a major threat to GameStop .
And an instant library on a console like Xbox One could potentially eat into GameStop 's sales . The brick-and-mortar retailer makes quite a lot of its money from secondhand sales where it resells products that consumers have traded in . If more people are playing digital games , that takes product out of the supply chain that could end up on GameStop store shelves . Additionally , Game Pass looks like it will primarily traffick in older games that people would typically would purchase used . Older releases like Mad Max , Saints Row IV , and Halo 5 are some of the big options that Microsoft is highlighting .

Of course , GameStop is n't completely removed from the digital-gaming ecosystem . The retailer sells a lot of currency cards for the Xbox Store , the PlayStation Store , the Steam PC-gaming portal , and it 's possible that people who do n't like using a credit card will purchase cards to buy their subscription to Game Pass through GameStop .
But that will likely not make up for a dearth of used-game sales or trade-ins if a lot of people adopt a Game Pass subscription .
Canada must move from laggard to leader when it comes to fighting child poverty , says Campaign 2000 in its annual report being released Thursday , the 26th anniversary of Ottawa 's 1989 pledge to eradicate the problem by the millennium . Despite the all-party resolution , child poverty has jumped from 15.8 per cent a generation ago to 18.3 per cent today . It soars to 60 per cent for First Nations children living on reserves .
Toronto single mother of three Dorthy Noble became homeless three years ago , but moved into a new apartment last year . They call the Canada Child Benefit a `` lifesaver . '' ( Andrew Francis Wallace / Toronto Star )
For those under age 6 , the rate is almost 20 per cent nationally and closer to 45 per cent for young children in Nunavut , according to the report based on Statistics Canada tax filer data for 2014 , the most recent available . “ Nearly one in five children in Canada live in poverty today because their families are forced to navigate the uncertainty of precarious work , skyrocketing housing costs , and uneven and unaffordable child care services while they try not to slip through the holes in Canada 's social safety net , ” said the group 's spokesperson Anita Khanna . Ottawa 's new Canada Child Benefit and a commitment to reduce and monitor child poverty are “ important steps forward , ” says Campaign 2000 , a non-partisan coalition of 120 national , provincial and local groups dedicated to the issue .

But with 1.3 million children still living in poverty and UNICEF ranking Canada 26th out of 35 wealthy nations for child inequality , more work needs to be done , Khanna noted . As an immediate measure , the coalition is urging the federal government to index the child benefit to inflation next year so families can keep up with the cost of living . Ottawa is n't scheduled to begin indexing the benefit until 2020 . The group also wants Ottawa to improve access to child benefits for children living on reserves where many parents do n't file tax returns and therefore are n't eligible . Eligibility should also be extended to parents appealing refugee claim denials , the report says . The child benefit , introduced by the Trudeau government in July , provides up to $ 6,400 annually for every child under age 6 and up to $ 5,400 for those under age 18 . The government says the measure will lift about 300,000 families out of poverty within the first year . The report also repeats its longstanding call for a national child care program , noting that just one-quarter of Canadian children under age 12 have access to a regulated spot .
Children in families led by single mothers and parents who are racialized , newcomers , indigenous , or facing disabilities are more likely to live in poverty which exposes them to ongoing social and economic inequality , the report says . Toronto single mother of three Dorthy Noble , 28 , became homeless three years ago when their abusive partner was deported and they could no longer afford the rent .

With family shelters full and a five-year wait list for subsidized housing , Noble spiraled into depression , addiction and life on the streets while their mother struggled to care for the kids . “ It was awful , ” Noble says . “ Not being able to have a safe place to lay my head . I was really scared. ” Noble credits counsellors with the Jean Tweed Centre for helping them battle depression and beat their addiction to prescription painkillers . The support gave their strength to find a two-bedroom apartment on the Etobicoke lake shore they share with their mother . They moved in June 2015 . “ The child benefit has been a lifesaver , ” Noble says of the $ 1,855 they receive every month for Faith , 6 , Nyla , 3 , and Gabriel , 3 months . “ I am able to pay my bills and feed my family. ” The stability has allowed Noble to participate in Working for Change , a program that helps people with histories of homelessness and addiction find their voice and chart a future . “ I am doing so much better now , ” says Noble . “ My plan is to study social work so I can give back. ” Ontario Campaign 2000 representatives will be at Queen 's Park on Thursday to remind the provincial Liberals that 2016 marks the half-way point of its second five-year poverty reduction strategy . More than 500,000 Ontario children , or 18.8 per cent , are living in poverty , according to the group 's annual report , putting the rate of child poverty in the province slightly above the national average . The provincial report urges Queen 's Park to step up efforts to create safe and affordable housing , good jobs , affordable , high quality child care and to increase the minimum wage to $ 15 an hour . Toronto is the child poverty capital of Canada with 133,000 children living in low-income families , a rate of 27 per cent , according to a report released earlier this month .
With President Donald Trump in China negotiating trade and discussing North Korea , several Republican lawmakers are advocating for greater diplomatic and military ties with Taiwan , a move that 's likely to infuriate Beijing .
Representatives Michael McCaul ( R-Texas ) and Robert Pittenger ( R-North Carolina ) introduced the “ Taiwan Security Act ” in the House , while Senator Tom Cotton ( R-Arkansas ) introduced it in the upper chamber . The bill seeks to expand already strong military ties between the US and the disputed island in a range of ways .
Introduced the Taiwan Security Act with @ reppittenger to prioritize our friends in Taiwan over Beijing 's demands : https : //t.co/aWSPfEAgwd — Michael McCaul ( @ RepMcCaul ) November 7 , 2017
It “ reestablishes an annual strategic dialogue ” between Washington and Taipei “ in order to ensure the regular transfer of defense articles , ” the proposed bill states . It also envisages the US inviting the Taiwanese military to participate in the Pacific Rim ( RIMPAC ) naval exercises and Red Flag air combat exercises .
Hosted by the US every two years in the Hawaiian islands , RIMPAC involves 26 countries and is the largest maritime military exercise in the world . The Red Flag air combat exercise includes 28 countries and is conducted over bombing and gunnery ranges at the Nellis Air Force Base in Nevada .

The proposed legislation also “ expresses Congressional support ” for Taiwan 's plan to spend 3 percent of its gross domestic product on defense , and pushes for Taiwan to “ suspend all economic ties ” with North Korea .
The act further “ mandates diplomatic exchanges ” between senior US and Taiwanese officials . US Navy visits to Taiwanese ports and reciprocal port calls would also be required .

The Trump administration signed a $ 1.4 billion arms deal with Taiwan in June , prompting outrage from China . The package included maintenance support for early-warning radar , high-speed anti-radiation missiles , as well as torpedoes and missile components . Previous US arms packages also included two frigates as well as anti-tank missiles and amphibious attack vehicles .
The arms deal sends “ a very wrong signal to the ‘ Taiwan independence ' forces and harms the cross-Straits peace and stability , ” the Chinese embassy in the US argued .
In May , Taiwan included live-fire drills as part of its annual exercises to prepare its military to defend against potential attacks from mainland China . Those maneuvers were observed by a team of retired US generals who offered recommendations , according to a military source cited by the South China Morning Post .
In 1949 , Taiwan became a refuge for the Republic of China government after it was ousted by Mao Zedong and the Chinese Communist Party . By 1971 , however , the UN had recognized Beijing as the only legitimate Chinese government , leaving Taiwan in a legal limbo . China considers Taiwan a renegade province that must be united with the mainland . Beijing insists that the world community stick to the “ One China policy , ” meaning that countries seeking diplomatic relations with the People 's Republic of China must sever official ties with Taiwan .

Mandatory Credit : Dale Zanine-USA TODAY Sports ( Photo : Dale Zanine , Dale Zanine-USA TODAY Sports ) Story Highlights Celtics at Pacers , 7 p.m. Tuesday , FSI
ATLANTA – George Hill wanted to move forward .
After falling flat 104-75 to the Atlanta Hawks , the Indiana Pacers ' largest margin of defeat for the season , Hill said the best course of action would be leaving the remains of that game inside the Philips Arena visitor 's locker room .
“ Nothing we can do about it now , ” Hill said Sunday night . “ None of this matters now . Our focus has to be Boston on Tuesday . ”
So before the Pacers ( 35-31 ) face another floor spacing and shooting team – such opponents becoming their greatest foe this season – Hill gazed into their team 's future and sought changes .
“ We 've got to make adjustments . It 's not about keeping people happy or things like that , it 's about winning , ” Hill said . “ We 've got to figure that out and figure out the best defense possible we can play to give ourselves a chance to win . ”
When asked for clarification on their veiled comment about “ not about keeping people happy , ” Hill did n't exactly illuminate the topic . Instead , Hill ambiguously described how teammates should prioritize team goals over individual ones .
“ We ca n't worry about this person or that person , how many shots people are getting or minutes , ” Hill said . “ We just got to try to win a game . ”
Such an attempt failed against the Hawks , who made 15-of-30 attempts from the 3-point arc . In spite of the loss , the Pacers remained in the 7th seed with a one-game lead over the Detroit Pistons . Among the 16 remaining games , 11 are at home . Nevertheless , the Pacers will still have to play several more opponents that could identify as spread teams .
While the Celtics ( 39-27 and 3rd in the East ) shoot plenty of 3-pointers , they do n't make them at a high rate ( .334 , 27th in the NBA ) . Even so , Boston can still score and ranks fourth in the league in posting 106.1 points per game .
So the defensive challenge continues , but in moving forward the Pacers will need more as a team .
“ It 's going to have to take a collective group , ” Hill said , “ and all of us have to be all in for it . ”

CROWDER 'S OUT : The Celtics were dealt a blow Saturday when second-leading scorer Jae Crowder sustained a high ankle sprain . According to Boston head coach Brad Stevens , Crowder will likely miss “ a couple weeks minimum. ” Bad timing for the Cs , who currently reside in the 3rd seed and have nine road games remaining on the calendar . Crowder , a 6-6 two-way player , averages 14.5 points per game and would have drawn the defensive assignment on Paul George .
PACERS PLAY BOSTON BETTER IN INDY : Dating back to last season , the Pacers have won four of the last five games against the Celtics at Bankers Life Fieldhouse . However the Pacers last faced their boss 's old team on Nov. 4 , very early in the season for the narrow 100-98 victory .
They SAID WHAT ? ! : “ Oh , s -- - . I did n't even think about that . Wow. ” – Evan Turner , reacting to their new role of taking on the defensive challenges at small forward in Crowder 's absence according to ESPN.com . During the 2013-14 season , Turner played the final 25 games with the Pacers
PREDICTION : The Celtics can show depth in bench players like Olynyk , who leads the team in 3-point shooting percentage , however the Crowder loss is a big one . While the Pacers are not facing major injuries , the lingering ones are problematic . Newest Pacer Ty Lawson has been limited for more than a week with a sore right foot . Rodney Stuckey blamed “ scar tissue ” for their absence early in the Atlanta matchup Sunday . Also C.J . Miles , two games back from their calf injury , still has to work back into rhythm . Team success depends on health . Even so if the Pacers can limit mistakes against Boston ( the leading team in creating turnovers ) and buckle down on defense , they should wrap up the season series against Boston , 3-1 . Indiana wins 108-106 .

Copyright by WBTW - All rights reserved In court documents , 39-year-old James Loftis admitted to killing two men , then burning and burying their bodies in the backyard of their Goose Creek home .
GOOSE CREEK , SC ( WCBD ) - Neighbors of the father accused of killing , burning then burying two people in their backyard over the weekend were trying to make sense of the grisly news Monday .
In court documents , 39-year-old James Loftis admitted to killing two men , then burning and burying their bodies in the backyard of their Goose Creek home . `` He was a nice guy and they helped us fix our windows and gutters , '' said Rosie Fredejas , who lives across the street from Loftis , `` I feel so bad for the family . ''
Loftis ' wife called police late Saturday night informing authorities that their husband had killed two people and was threatening to kill himself .
A reserve Berkeley County deputy noticed the smell of marijuana coming from an empty taxi van parked on Old Back River Road . The deputies could not find the owner but they found out the vehicle was involved in something far more disturbing .
Loftis told police they caught a taxi from the strip club Saturday . Once they made it back home , they claim the taxi driver and another man shoved their way into their home because they wanted them to pay their cab fare . Loftis reportedly grabbed a .45 caliber handgun and shot the two men eight times .
Police say they then walked to a gas station bought gasoline then came back to their house and set fire to all the evidence in a pit in their backyard . The taxi van involved was registered to a Global Mobile Taxi Services .
On Monday , Goose Creek officials said it is not appropriate to release the identities of the victims yet .
I really struggled to come up with a title for this post , and I finally settled on the only thing that kept coming to the fore-front of my mind … because the WDW community does rock !
Last October , as Mrs. All in WDW and I anxiously waited for the Canada Food & Wine booth to open , Rick Howard – President and Owner of Kingdom Magic Vacations and host of the Travel with Rick video podcast – passed by on their way to record an episode of their show . We called out to him , and they kindly took the time to stop by and visit . It just happened to be my 50th birthday that day , and I told them that their time , as well as the picture they took with us , was a very memorable birthday present . Of course , that was way back before All in WDW was born , but it was one of the things that drove me to bring this site to life .
Fast-forward to yesterday … after a brief Twitter and email exchange with Rick , we were honored to have the opportunity to meet with them once again . But , not only did we get to meet with Rick , we also had the chance to sit and talk with their lovely wife , Leslie , and their fantastic associate John Donahue of WDW Parkhoppers . John works very closely with Rick , Kingdom Magic Vacations , and the Travel with Rick show .
It was a fabulous opportunity to spend a couple of hours learning from people who have been part of the WDW blogging community for years . The knowledge we gained from our ( to us ) all-too-brief meeting was absolutely invaluable , but the most important message we heard was to remember why we blog . We need to remember that we started All in WDW to express our love of Walt Disney World , and we need to remember that we blog for you – the kind and generous people that share a few minutes of your precious time every day to visit with us .
In the months since we opened , we have been blessed to meet some of the Disney community of bloggers and meet some of you – our readers . We thank you for your continued support , and we ca n't urge you enough to visit Rick and John at Kingdom Magic Vacations , Travel with Rick , and WDW Parkhoppers . They are truly phenomenal people ! Oh , and follow them on Facebook and Twitter , my friends !
Thanks , again , for your time yesterday , guys . It went way too fast !
For years now , the FBI has been warning legislators and CEOs about criminals `` going dark '' through encryption — and the responsibility of companies like Apple and Google to stop it from happening . But according to a new study from Harvard 's Berkman Center for Internet and Society , that 's not what 's happening at all . Titled `` Do n't Panic , '' the paper unpacks the context of the recent debate around encryption , ultimately deciding that police are at little risk of being locked out of digital communications at large .
The paper does n't deny that encryption has made some communications inaccessible , but argues those difficulties are easily made up for with new channels and opportunities for evidence-gathering . `` There are and will always be pockets of dimness and some dark spots — communications channels resistant to surveillance — but this does not mean we are completely 'going dark , ' '' the paper reads . `` Some areas are more illuminated now than in the past and others are brightening . ''
`` Some areas are more illuminated now than in the past and others are brightening . ''
The paper is the result of more than a year of work by a panel of 12 authors , including an esteemed cryptographer , a former federal judge , and a former NSA general counsel . Two current NSA officials were also consulted in the research phase , but unable to sign the final draft due to agency restrictions on public statements .
The authors run down four main factors that will keep those new areas from going dark without state intervention . First , they argue that end-to-end encryption is incompatible with the data collection needed to make money from online services like Gmail and Facebook . They also argue that the modern web is too fragmented for comprehensive encryption to exist at a broad scale . Even if content encryption became widespread , it would n't protect metadata , the so-called `` front of the envelope '' information that ca n't be encrypted and provides crucial information to investigators looking to map criminal networks . Finally , the authors point to networked sensors and the so-called `` Internet of Things , '' as persistent sources of surveillance data that police can tap into in the future .
The result is a good rebuttal to FBI requests for legislation , but not necessarily good news for privacy . Even with encrypted chat programs , there are a multitude of ways police can spy on a person 's activities . `` Are we really headed to a future in which our ability to effectively surveil criminals and bad actors is impossible ? '' the paper asks . `` We think not . ''
On July 7 , 2011 , the Humane Society of the United States and United Egg Producers announced that they would “ work together to seek a federal law that would require larger cages and other improved conditions for the nation 's 280 million laying hens . ”
The proposed legislation , if passed , will be phased in over the next 18 years and will require :
cages that give hens up to 144 square inches of space each , compared with the 67 square inches that most hens have today . They would also include so-called habitat enrichments , like perches , scratching areas and nesting areas , that allow the birds to express natural behavior .
What will HSUS give as its part of the compromise agreement ? HSUS has
agreed to give up on a push to ban cages entirely in exchange for the opportunity to work toward a single , nationwide standard mandating better conditions . The group also said it would shelve efforts to get initiatives onto the ballot in Washington and Oregon , and would agree not to conduct undercover investigations at large egg farms unless it was aware of especially egregious practices .
HSUS calls this “ historic ” . There will , of course , be a big campaign to get the legislation passed and there will , of course , be all sorts of legal challenges . The “ compassion show ” will go on for years . The requests for donations “ to help the animals ” will be endless .
And the best case scenario is that the bill is introduced and passed quickly . What would the hens gain ? They would get 124-144 square inches of space in an “ enriched ” cage , phased in over 18 years , and the “ happy ” eggs that they produce will have the stamp of approval of HSUS . This situation is analogous to those opposed to water boarding announcing that they had made an agreement to phase in padded water boards over an 18-year period .
There have been two very opposite reactions on the part of animal advocates to this HSUS-UEP agreement .
First , some advocates are criticizing HSUS , claiming that this agreement is a sell-out . They are correct that this is a disaster for animals but , in all fairness , what can one expect from the Humane Society ?
HSUS explicitly denies that it endorses animal rights or the abolition of animal exploitation . On the contrary , HSUS supports the Humane Farm Animal Care 's Certified Humane Raised and Handled “ happy meat ” label and two high-level HSUS executives sit on the board of Humane Farm Animal Care .
Humane Society International ( HSI ) , is an affiliate of HSUS and the CEO of HSI is an HSUS executive . One HSI branch in Australia , which describes itself as “ the global arm of HSUS , ” sponsors a “ happy meat ” label for which it charges a fee .
HSUS CEO Wayne Pacelle acknowledges that “ the Humane Society is broad-minded when it comes to food . About 95 percent of our members are not vegetarian. ” They add :
But I believe eating is a moral act , and we can make choices to minimize the suffering of ( food ) animals . We can buy cage-free eggs , buy pork that does n't come from factory farms , and avoid eating veal and foie gras .
and
Our program is about responsible hunting and curbing the worst excesses and the most inhumane and unsporting practices . Sportfishing is not an issue , unless someone did something horrible , like dynamiting fish . Most of the work we 've done in the marine realm has been protecting marine mammals and seabirds .
Pacelle also states :
Our board of directors is a national volunteer board of directors . Very few of them are vegetarian . I have been since I 've been a teenager . Whatever I do in my personal life does not necessarily reflect the policies of HSUS and we support certified humane programs , we support other farmers , we work with farmers , we think farming is a noble profession . I do n't think anyone can reasonably claim that our work is moving in the direction of eliminating animal agriculture as some of the folks in the industry keep repeating .
So joining forces with the egg industry to produce and promote “ happy ” eggs fits comfortably with what HSUS has been doing for decades . The HSUS-UEP agreement merely confirms-again-that HSUS is all about making deals with industry and making their non-vegetarian members feel that they are engaging in morally acceptable behavior when they buy the “ happy ” meat and dairy and eggs approved by HSUS .
What HSUS is doing is applying the meaningless concept of “ humane ” exploitation as it has been applied for the past 200 years . The only difference between HSUS 50 years ago and HSUS now is that HSUS today is promoting its philosophy of “ feel good ” exploitation to farm animals whereas 50 years ago , they were focused primarily on the animals that we fetishize as a cultural matter : dogs and cats .
The second reaction on the part of animal advocates who claim to be more progressive than HSUS to agree with HSUS that this agreement is some sort of “ historic ” event ; a “ landmark ” for animals ; a “ step ” toward animal rights .
That is just plain silly . “ Enriched ” cages involve torturing hens . Period . The torture may be slightly “ better , ” just as padded water boards may be slightly “ better. ” But let 's be clear : the hens will continue to be tortured . And they will continue to end up in a slaughterhouse . The only difference is that these tortured eggs will be declared to be “ humane ” by HSUS . This agreement will be counterproductive in that it will encourage the belief that we can exploit animals in a “ kind ” or “ compassionate ” way .
Many animal advocates claim that people are going to continue to eat eggs so we have to do something for animals suffering now . But this agreement , like most of the “ happy ” exploitation arrangements promoted by HSUS and other organizations , including those who claim to be “ animal rights ” groups , does not take effect for many years-in this case , 18 years . To the extent that this agreement provides any benefit for animals , it will not occur for many , many years . And even if “ enriched cages ” provide some welfare benefit , this sort of “ reform ” makes the public more comfortable about consuming eggs and that guarantees continued consumption .
The problem is that although we should expect nothing more from the “ Humane ” Society , other organizations that claim to promote animal rights , and ostensibly to endorse the abolition of animal exploitation , also support these sorts of agreements . Virtually all of the large animal groups in the United States and Europe have come out in support of one or more “ happy ” labels and virtually all are busy making deals with institutional animal users . And supposedly more progressive organizations have already come out in favor of the HSUS-UEP . Indeed , Farm Sanctuary is trying to claim credit , along with HSUS , for the agreement .
The only way that the paradigm of animal exploitation will ever shift is if we educate people to stop demanding animal products based on the recognition that animals are members of the moral community . That goal is not as idealistic as it might appear : most people agree that it is wrong to inflict “ unnecessary ” suffering or death on animals . They understand that this moral principle excludes suffering or death for reasons of pleasure or convenience or habit . That is why there was such a strongly negative reaction to Michael Vick 's use of dogs for fighting . Vick 's pleasure in watching dogs fight did not justify their infliction of suffering and death on the dogs . The same reasoning applies to our eating animals . There is no difference between sitting around the pit watching dogs fight and sitting around a summer barbecue roasting the corpses of tortured animals or enjoying the dairy or eggs from tortured animals .
We need to educate people that our continued exploitation of animals for food , clothing , entertainment , etc. , is unjust ; that it is not merely a matter of how we treat animals , but that we use them at all . The reaction to Vick teaches us clearly that people , or at least many people , can understand this idea and accept it . We need to get them to apply it to animals beyond dogs or cats . That can be done through creative , nonviolent education .
The only way that things will ever change is if we build a movement of people who see veganism as a clear moral baseline and where that movement can serve as a catalyst to shift the paradigm away from thinking of nonhumans as commodities for us to use exclusively as means to our ends .
And that will never happen as long as we think that “ happy ” exploitation is any sort of answer . The belief that “ happy ” exploitation will result in significant welfare benefits for animals and that this will lead to abolition in the future is simply wrong on both counts .
In conclusion : those who criticize HSUS for making such an agreement should recognize that this sort of thing is exactly what HSUS has been doing forever . It is the “ Humane ” Society . And “ humane ” is a meaningless concept in a context in which animals are chattel property . HSUS exists to make people who exploit animals feel better about exploitation . And those who claim that this is a “ landmark ” agreement for animals and will lead to significant welfare benefits in the near term and reduced use or abolition in the future , should recognize that promoting the notion of “ compassionate ” exploitation will never-can never-lead to the rejection of animal use . It will only reinforce and perpetuate that use .
Please understand that I in no way question the sincerity of those who support these partnerships with industry or the welfare reforms that are involved . I do , however , believe sincerely that they are wrong .
* * * * * *
If you are not vegan , please consider going vegan . It 's easy to go vegan ; it 's better for your health and for the planet ; and , most important , it 's the morally right thing to do .
If you are vegan , educate everyone with whom you come in contact in a creative , nonviolent way about veganism . If we really do regard animals as members of the moral community ; if we really believe that we can not justify unnecessary animal suffering and death , then we can not justify billions of animal death based on palate pleasure .
And please remember : veganism is not just a matter of reducing suffering ; it 's a matter of fundamental moral justice . It is what we owe to those who , like us , value their lives and who want to continue to live .
The World is Vegan ! If you want it .

One of the victims of a mass shooting inside a movie theatre near Denver , Colorado , was an aspiring sportscaster who last month narrowly missed a shooting at Toronto 's Eaton Centre shopping mall .
Jessica Ghawi , 25 , is among at least 12 people who died when a gunman wearing a gas mark fired bullets into a crowded movie theatre during the midnight showing of the new Batman movie .
Ghawi , described by friends as a bubbly and ambitious redhead , recently moved to Denver from Texas , according to TV station Kens5 .
The young woman wrote about their experience missing the shooting in Toronto by only a few minutes . A man sprayed bullets in a crowded food court , killing one man instantly and injuring another who would later die in hospital .
In a blog post , Ghawi explains how they “ felt funny ” while sitting in the food court at Eaton Centre and decided to step outside to get some fresh air . Minutes later , shots rang out and shoppers started “ funneling out of every exit , ” they wrote .
My friend Jessica Ghawi was killed in the # Aurora Shooting-she was an aspiring sportscaster-she will be missed yfrog.com/oc7ruuhj — Natalie Tejeda ( @ natalietejeda ) July 20 , 2012
“ I 'm not an EMT or a police officer . I 'm not trained to handle crime and murder , ” Ghawi wrote in a blog post on June 5 .
“ Gun crimes are fairly common where I grew up in Texas , but I never imagined I 'd experience a violent crime first hand . I 'm on vacation and wanted to eat and go shopping . Everyone else at the mall probably wanted the same thing . I doubt anyone left for the mall imagined they witness [ sic ] a shooting . ”
Reached in Helotes , Texas , on Friday morning , Ghawi 's father Nick said their son flew out to Denver as soon as the family heard about the shooting .
Initially , authorities had not confirmed their daughter had died , they said .
“ That 's why our son flew right away , he 's an EMT and a firefighter and they should be able to get through and confirm , ” Nick said .
[ np-related ]
A post on Ghawi 's brother Jordan 's blog details what allegedly happened after the gunman entered the theatre and started firing their gun , according to Ghawi 's friend , who was present .
Ghawi was hit in the leg first and their friend did their best to administer first aid , the blog post says . Them friend was then hit on the lower half of their body . When Ghawi suddenly stopped screaming , their friend looked over and saw she 'd been shot in the head .
“ [ The friend ] then took what may have been their only chance to escape the line of fire and exited the structure where they then contacted my mother , ” Jordan Ghawi wrote . “ [ The friend 's ] actions are nothing but heroic . ”
Tributes to the young woman began pouring out online and on Twitter . Condolences came from the Can Play Project , an organization founded by the son of Toronto Maple Leafs general manager Brian Burke .
Patrick Burke started to the organization to provide support for LGBT athletes . Ghawi , who also used the last name Redfield , was working for the Denver-based organization as an intern .
“ Our staff is despondent today over the loss of our intern Jessica Redfield , ” the organization tweeted . “ We will miss their intelligence , kindness , and work ethic greatly . ”
Devastated . Lost a very close friend in the shooting last night . @ JessicaRedfield came to Denver to pursue sports career . I 'm shaking — Peter Burns ( @ PeterBurnsRadio ) July 20 , 2012
I lost a good friend today . @ JessicaRedfield was effervescent , funny , sharp , caring and just awesome .. They died in the shootings . — Benjamin Hochman ( @ nuggetsnews ) July 20 , 2012

Denver Post columnist Adrian Dater said they exchanged a few messages with Ghawi on Twitter yesterday . The two also chatted a few weeks ago about internship programs and the journalism business .
“ I 'm in total disbelief , ” they said .
“ She was just moving into a new apartment and excited about that . They had a boyfriend , and was excited about that . We also talked about them being right there in the food court at the Eaton Centre when that random shooting happened , and how much it was still affecting them Now this . They were a very smart , funny and ambitious person who wanted to make a go of it in the sports journalism business . It 's a tragedy . ”
Ghawi 's boyfriend is Jay Meloff , a hockey player from Markham , Ont. , who is training to attend the Denver Cutthroats ' free agent camp in a few weeks , said Denver sports writer Cheryl Bradley .
Ghawi was in Toronto last month to visit Meloff .
“ I just got off the phone with him . As you can imagine , he 's not doing to well , ” Bradley said in an interview . “ He 's supposed to come out for training camp . At this point , not sure what 's going to happen… I really hope they continue to play . ”
A career in journalism is an uphill and often disheartening pursuit but Ghawi had the spark and wit to do it , Bradley said .
“ She had their whole life ahead of her . ”

Quarantine is a 1994 racing/first-person shooter video game for MS-DOS and 3DO , created by Imagexcel and published by GameTek . Versions for the Japanese market were done in 1996 by Asmik for the PlayStation and MediaQuest for the Sega Saturn , renamed as Hard Rock Cab and Death Throttle respectively . In the game the player drives a taxicab through a post-apocalyptic city , picking up customers and killing enemies . Due to the gratuitous violence the game was controversial at the time of release .
Background history [ edit ]
The success of Doom by id Software in 1993 led to many other companies attempting to follow Doom 's success . Most ended up making unsuccessful `` doom clones '' . Quarantine was one of the few games that successfully exploited the features of Doom with its own texture mapped stages , semi-open world maps , and vehicular combat gameplay . The game was later continued with the sequel , Quarantine II : Road Warrior , which largely kept the original gameplay , but introduced a more mission and story-driven gameplay .
Plot [ edit ]
KEMO city was known for the manufacture of hovercars , meeting the country 's demands for transportation until 2022 . Over time , however , the crime rate had risen so far that the economy collapsed and the city descended into disorder . Criminals roamed the streets in armored hovercars , terrorizing the citizens without fear of retribution . In 2029 , OmniCorp promised city officials that it could clean up KEMO and return it to normal . The offer was accepted , and the corporation began the construction of a massive wall around the city under the guise of a `` defensive measure '' . The wall was completed three years later , and the only exit sealed shut , turning KEMO into a massive prison city for all inside , criminal or otherwise . The outraged population reacted violently , and the city degenerated .
Ten years later OmniCorp decided to test the behavior altering chemical Hydergine 344 on the population of KEMO . This chemical was supposed to pacify the citizens and distributed through the city 's water supply . Unfortunately , OmniCorp failed to predict the chemical 's reaction to stagnant water , resulting in massive brain damage and insanity in the many citizens . More than half the population became crazed killers overnight .
Drake Edgewater , a 21st-century cab driver and one of the lucky few unaffected by the spreading virus , is desperate to escape the city alive . Driving their '52 Checker hovercab armed with an assortment of headlight-mounted weaponry , they deliver passengers and packages for what money they can make to upgrade their vehicle and escape .
Gameplay [ edit ]
Quarantine required a rather powerful system when it was released . One of the original ads in magazines for the game used the slogan `` If you 've got the ram , we 've got the pedestrians . ''
Quarantine , long before Grand Theft Auto III and other similar games , employed the drive-by shooting tactic of using the Uzi to shoot out from the side windows . [ 1 ]
Soundtrack [ edit ]
The CD version features tracks from Australian alternative bands .
Versions [ edit ]
The PlayStation and Sega Saturn versions were released in Japan exclusively , under the names Hard Rock Cab and Death Throttle , respectively . They are mostly the same as the original PC version , but while they had enhanced floor and building texturing , they suffer from slowdown and pixelation . The essential textscreen information is translated to Japanese , though most text remains in English and the live action video is neither dubbed nor subtitled . Additionally , the PlayStation version features green blood censorship .
Reception [ edit ]
Next Generation reviewed the PC version of the game , stating that `` Plenty of new weapons and powerup items along with different mission options give the game long-term play potential . Bloody fun for budding psychotics . `` [ 3 ]
Reviewing the 3DO version , the four reviewers of Electronic Gaming Monthly were divided . They all concurred that the driving controls are subpar , but while three of them opined that Quarantine would appeal to a niche audience ( one predicted it `` may be a cult hit '' ) with its soundtrack and strange , tongue-in-cheek humor , the fourth simply declared it `` Too warped for me . `` [ 2 ] GamePro 's reviewer also predicted the game was `` bound to gain cult status '' and gave it a rave review , praising the usefulness of the four camera views , the high level of uncensored violence , the introductory FMV , the `` macabre '' backgrounds , and the large selection of rock music tracks . They noted that the driving controls are difficult but concluded that `` Doom lovers looking to score more gore will dig this grim , futuristic escape saga '' . [ 5 ] A reviewer for Next Generation commented that while the open world , open-ended structure is captivating , both it and the vehicle 's controls have a steep learning curve which demands that the player spend considerable time learning the game before actually playing it . They concluded that `` the game is on balance , once you get the hang of things , and it 's cool '' . [ 4 ]
Sequel [ edit ]
A sequel , Quarantine II : Road Warrior , was released in 1995 for DOS .
It 's one of the ultimate TV trivia questions : Who was the first couple to be portrayed on a television series as sleeping in the same bed ? It may sound like a silly question to younger readers , but those of us who were around for television 's first few decades recall how squeamish the industry remained for many years , much more so than its cinematic counterpart , which was a bit looser because , unlike television , it did not broadcast its product directly into viewers ' living rooms . Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz , who were married in real life and portrayed a married couple on the most popular show of television 's early years , I Love Lucy ( 1951-57 ) , were depicted as sleeping in separate beds . Even more astonishingly , although Lucille Ball 's character , Lucy Ricardo , was portrayed as giving birth on an episode of the series the very same day that Lucille Ball themselves bore a son , and the character of the real-life child was incorporated into the show itself , CBS was still unwilling to allow the word “ pregnant ” to be used on the air and did their best to avoid displaying Lucille Ball 's obvious “ condition ” to the viewing audience . Yes , this all took place in the “ early days , ” but even as late as 1969-74 series The Brady Bunch , six children shared a single bathroom that lacked a toilet .
So , when did television bow to the obvious and finally show a married couple sharing a single bed ? The Brady Bunch , the series without a toilet , is often named , but then others point out that Herman and Lily shared a bed on The Munsters from 1964-66 . ( The eligibility of this one as a valid answer is sometimes questioned because the Munsters were n't exactly a “ human ” couple . ) Others claim that Fred and Wilma bunked together on The Flintstones from 1960-66 ( but their eligibility is also questioned because despite being human in character , they were cartoons and not real actors ) . Occasionally the Nelsons , the married stars of ABC 's long-running The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet ( 1952-66 ) are proffered as the correct answer .
Would it surprise you to find out that the answer is a show that antedates even I Love Lucy ? A program that was , in fact , television 's very first sitcom ?
On Tuesday , 18 November 1947 , a 15-minute program entitled Mary Kay and Johnny made its debut on the Dumont network . Like the more famous I Love Lucy series that followed it , Mary Kay and Johnny starred a real-life couple , actors Johnny and Mary Kay Stearns . Mary Kay had been modeling junior wear on a weekly TV show when their husband pitched the idea of a television-based domestic comedy to a sponsor . ( Many such domestic shows , often featuring real-life couples , were playing on radio , but none had yet made the transition to television ) . Johnny got the go-ahead to produce a single episode , so they wrote a light comedic script about a newly-married couple who lived in a Greenwich Village apartment , just as they and Mary Kay , also a newly-married couple , did . The show caught on , and Mary Kay and Johnny , performed live , became television 's first sitcom , eventually running for three years on three different networks ( Dumont , NBC , and CBS ) .
Another foreshadowing of the later I Love Lucy series occurred in December 1948 when the birth of the Stearns ' first child was worked into an episode on the same day that Mary Kay themselves gave birth , and the infant character was later added to the cast . ( Since the show was performed live , obviously Mary Kay 's character could not be shown giving birth on television while they gave birth for real in a hospital . That evening 's episode instead featured a nervous Johnny anxiously pacing in a hospital waiting room while awaiting news of their off-screen wife . )
Because of the inherent limitations of live television , most of the episodes of Mary Kay and Johnny were set in the couple 's apartment . Mary Kay and Johnny 's apartment included a bedroom ( but not a bathroom ) , and their bedroom had but a single bed , which they shared . How do we explain this lack of the squeamishness about bedroom ( if not bathroom ) functions that was soon manifested in the television industry ? Who knows ? Perhaps it had something to do with the fact that the show was on Dumont , that it was live , or that in those days the production of shows was financed by sponsors rather than by the networks . Perhaps the medium was just too new for anyone to have grown uptight about such concerns yet . All that matters is that Mary Kay and Johnny were there first .
With spring training officially underway , the Mets and their fans are gearing up for the 2017 season ; the 2016 is officially in the rear-view mirror . But before spring really gets into full swing , let 's take one last look back at the 2016 season . More specifically , let 's look at one event from 2016 that we should probably talk about .
Launch angle is a really cool stat . Released to the public in 2015 via Baseball Savant , it essentially measures the angle at which the ball comes off the bat of the player who hit it . For balls hit into play—as opposed to foul balls—a fly ball is estimated as any ball between 25-50 degrees , a ground ball is estimated as anything lower than 10 degrees , and a pop-up is anything over 50 degrees . To help illustrate this , here is a launch angle breakdown of Asdrubal Cabrera last year :
As you can see , a ball hit at 80 degrees is essentially a pop-up straight up , whereas a ball hit at -80 degrees is basically a ground ball pounded directly down . Believe it or not , in 2016 , there were 48 balls hit below -79 degrees . That includes a number of balls hit below -80 degrees . Yes , it 's possible for a ball to be hit below -80 degrees . It is possible to hit a ball almost straight down and have it bounce forward into fair territory .
The lowest launch angle recorded on a ground ball in the 2016 season was “ hit ” by Salvador Perez at -87.44 degrees . There were some balls hit worse than this in 2015 , but this was the worst in the 2016 season by a safe margin . The pitcher who induced this awful contact was the Mets ' Erik Goeddel on June 21 . One way of looking at it is that Goeddel coaxed Perez into hitting the worst-contacted ground ball of the entire season . It was n't the slowest ball hit , and it was n't the shortest ball hit , but it was the most downward-hit ball from the point of contact .
It should be noted , though , that accuracy is not always guaranteed with granular data like this . There are errors , and not everything is always precise down to the millimeter . The difference between a ball hit at -80 and -60 degrees is mere inches . So whether this was actually the worst-struck ground ball of 2016 is not completely certain . That said , launch angle says it is , so we 're running with it .
Unsurprisingly , balls hit at these angles do n't usually see much success . 163 balls have been hit at or below -75 degrees in the last two years , and only 23 of those have gone for a hit , which is a batting average of .172 . Only two errors have been made on those 163 plays .
And Perez is remarkably slow . Fangraphs ' speed score measures a player 's speed in one number , and in 2016 they rated Perez 's speed at 2.0 , which Fangraphs classifies as “ awful. ” A 4.5 is considered average . Only one of those 23 hits was struck by a player—Troy Tulowitzki—with a speed score as low as 2.0 for the season they hit it in . So not many players beat out ground balls like this to begin with , but players as slow as Perez almost never do .
This is the worst-hit ground ball of the season by an extremely slow runner . This might be the easiest out of Goeddel 's career—except it is n't .
Goeddel was charged with a throwing error . How did this happen ? How did Goeddel and the Mets mess this up ? Let 's have a look at what went wrong .
First of all , let 's review how we got here . Bartolo Colon had to leave this game in the first inning after being hit by a comebacker , so this was a bullpen game . Goeddel came on to pitch in the sixth , and got the first two outs without issue . Perez came up as the third hitter , and Goeddel delivered a fastball on 0-2 in this location :
That got Salvador Perez to reach for it , and they hit it completely off the end of the bat :
And that is how you hit a ball at -87 degrees , which looks like this :
The ball trickles out in front of the mound , and there is momentary confusion between Goeddel and Travis d'Arnaud about who is going to pick the ball up . Goeddel gets to it , but unfortunately , they rush the throw and chucks the ball into the ground :
There was no need to rush this throw . Look at where Perez is when Goeddel gets to the ball . This is just a case of Goeddel 's inexperience rearing its head . They had never faced the Royals before this , and clearly did n't know the speed of the runner , so they panicked . That said , the ball was still playable , and it got to James Loney well before Perez got to first base . It went in and out of Loney 's glove . The biggest problem here is n't Goeddel 's throw , it 's actually how James Loney tried to play this ball :
This throw is coming from the pitcher 's mound . Loney stretches their leg towards second base and bends their knee to play it on a hop . If they had simply stepped toward the throw and actually stretched their leg , reaching for the ball , that would have been a routine play , Perez would have been out , and this article would not have been written . Fielding balls awkwardly like this was a common theme for Loney last year , as Steve Schreiber documented .
And on the broadcast , Keith Hernandez similarly criticized Loney 's fundies on this play and pointed out their odd instincts to go to a knee to field a ball :
“ This is a habit that Loney has . See how he 's on their knee and not stretching ? He 's getting on their knee as if he 's receiving a throw from second base . If they had stretched towards the throw , that ball would not have been in the dirt . ”
Thankfully for the Mets , this did n't come back to hurt them in any way , as Goeddel got through the inning and they won the game 2-1 . But the point still stands : Goeddel and the Mets got what was probably the worst-struck ground ball of the 2016 season , and could n't turn it into an out against one of the league 's slowest runners . That 's a special feat .
An Indian famous national level kabaddi player Sukhvinder Narwhal was shot dead by two unidentified killers in Rohtak on Tuesday . The player , Sukhvinder Narwhal , was executed when they are on their way back to home from practice .
However ; the brutal incident was recorded on a CCTV installed near Sukhvinder Narwhal house . The footage demonstrates Sukhvinder chatting on their cellphone when the two attackers drew nearer him .
Two men got off their bike and fired at them over and over in the head . At a certain point , the kabaddi player , lying on the ground , swings over to their side in the wake of being shot before gradually falling back onto the street .
In December 2013 , another kabaddi player named Deepak Kumar was murdered after men on a bike shot them in an abandoned some portion of Rohtak . They lay on the roadside for 60 minutes before their sibling touched base to help him .
Japanese space startup ALE is the first of its kind — it wants to make on-demand shooting stars for people .
ALE , which stands for Astro Live Experiences , is the brainchild of Lena Okajima , who came up with the idea in 2001 after seeing the Leonid meteor shower .
“ I went with friends to see the meteors fall as shooting stars . The way they shot across the skies was very beautiful , and I thought to myself ‘ it would be incredible if we could create something like that , ' ” they told Forbes last year .
Sixteen years later , that idea is bound to become a reality . Okajima , now CEO of ALE , aims to launch the first artificial shooting stars in Japan by 2019 .
At its core , ALE is an intersection of science and entertainment . Its main product are “ shooting star particles , ” which are tiny pellets containing a secret formula that burns with friction .
The pellets are then brought up to the atmosphere via a small satellite , which releases them when it 's showtime . Their composition can be altered so that they burn in different colors .
“ It is artificial but I want to make really beautiful ones that can impress viewers , ” Okajima told the Daily Mail .
# JapanBrandProgram Lena Okajima , ALE Co. , Ltd visited Malaysia , Singapore to give lectures on shooting stars project https : //t.co/zx5GOfetBL pic.twitter.com/iU5OSIFP3R — MOFA of Japan ( @ MofaJapan_en ) March 3 , 2017
ALE 's on-demand shooting stars are expected to be better than natural meteor showers , as they would travel much slower — giving viewers more time to appreciate their cosmic beauty , CNN noted .
Okajima , who holds a Ph.D. from the University of Tokyo , has been interested in space since childhood . While they dreamed of becoming a real scientist , they never thought of founding a space company in 2011 .
Today , ALE is manned by about 14 people , most of whom are engineers , and half of the staff are women .
ALE targets outdoor festivals , sports games , theme parks and other big events as potential customers . Eventually , Okajima hopes that their company will foster a new cultural venue .
“ We want to create a culture of stargazing like the cherry blossom viewing culture in Japan – except in space watching shooting stars , ” they told Forbes in a recent interview .
For now , prospective spectators can keep an eye on Okajima 's Sky Canvas Project , which aims to showcase the world 's first artificial meteor shower in early 2019 , according to Newsweek .

Blind dates are already both exciting and terrifying—the former because you might meet your future soulmate , and the latter because your date might end up boiling your bunny . That 's why a privacy bug in OKCupid 's brand-new app , Crazy Blind Date , was even more disturbing than usual , even though there 's no evidence of that data having been accessed .
The app 's goal is to anonymously match you with another dater in your area for , well , a blind date . But the app apparently made users ' full e-mail addresses and birth dates easily accessible `` to anyone with the right technical skills , '' the Wall Street Journal discovered , thereby voiding much of the app 's benefit . Worse , the bug could be used to see the information of anyone nearby who had signed up to use the service—a blind date did not have to be arranged first—putting the personal information of all of the new app 's users at risk .
According to the WSJ , the bug came from Crazy Blind Date 's API . In addition to the e-mail addresses and birth dates , someone could use the API to grab a Crazy Blind Date user 's ID and correlate it to their or their OKCupid profile , potentially finding more information on that person .
OKCupid fixed the hole immediately after being notified by the WSJ of its findings ; a version 1.1 is already out on the App Store , and OKCupid CEO Sam Yagan says there 's no evidence that the exploit was actually used . ( There is also a version of this app for Android devices . ) Still , the incident highlights how easily our information can be accessed through various online services , even when they advertise otherwise . Similarly , a recent FTC report found that numerous children 's apps on the App Store collect and report personal information to a remote server , even when they explicitly claim that they do n't in their privacy policies .
How do you deal with that as a potential online dater ? My personal advice for those using Crazy Blind Date is the same for anyone who might be meeting up with strangers : use a separate , non-identifiable e-mail address to register your account , even if the service claims your e-mail wo n't be made public . It 's also a good idea to fudge your birth date a little bit—subtracting 10 years might be a bit much , but moving the date by a few days could help to keep your info more obscure .
There have been a number of high profile athletes coming out lately and calling on us all to work together ( see Lebron James Goes Against # BlackLivesMatter Grain : It 's Time to Look in the Mirror… and Michael Jordan Donates $ 1 Mil to Support Police… BlackLivesMatter RAGE ! ) . You can add Seattle Seahawk Richard Sherman to the list .
This is n't the first time the cornerback has spoken out on # BlackLivesMatter . A fake meme that many in the blogosphere thought was real led them to comment on the movement . This is , however , the first time they said the three most offensive words in the English language…all lives matter .
It 's hard to formulate an opinion and generalize because they have several different messages . Some of them are peaceful and understandable and some of them are very radical and hard to support . Any time you see people who are saying , ‘ Black Lives Matter , ' and then saying it 's time to kill police , then it is difficult to stand behind that logic . They are generalizing police just like they are asking police not to generalize us . It is very hypocritical . So , in that respect , I find it difficult to fully support that movement .
I bolded the above because it 's the money quote . BlackLivesMatter does n't want police officers to “ profile ” all black men into one category…while BlackLivesMatter tends to categorize all police officers as racist snotweasels who hunt black men for sport . So good point , Sherman .
I stand by what I said that All Lives Matter and that we are human beings . And speaking to police , I want African-Americans and everybody else treated decently . I want them treated like human beings . And I also want the police treated like human beings . I do n't want police officers just getting knocked off in the street who have n't done anything wrong . Those are innocent lives .
This is , you would think , reasonable . They touched on the core issues that # BlackLivesMatter claims to be about , but mentioned where they go wrong , thus making it hard to sympathize and embrace them . I think most on the right can agree . Our issue with BLM , for the most part , is the same with any leftist protest . How much of it is wanting to actually solve a problem , and how much of it is just wanting to protest , destroy things , and trend on social media ?
People like Richard Sherman stepping out , taking a more active role , helps with the conversation we need to have . A real conversation .
But they said “ all lives matter , ” so of course , ALT+RIGHT+OUTRAGE…

Yes . Because saying that has human beings “ all lives matter ” is problematic . But thanks for , as usual , clearing up your priorities , BlackLivesMatter .

General Philip Breedlove , Supreme Allied Commander Europe , recently gently but unmistakably reprimanded the US intelligence community for its “ lack of ability to see into Russia , especially at the operational and tactical level. ” While they acknowledged change was under way , even then they made it clear that this was very , very much a work in progress : “ We 're gently turning the nose of this ship to get back to what we need to be looking at. ” Is Russia befuddling US intelligence , and if so what should be done about it ?
Outside the movies , intelligence rarely gets a good press . On screen , the perceptive analyst or gung-ho field agent gets that one scrap of world-changing intel , realizes what it means , and suddenly—typically , just in the nick of time—policy spins on the proverbial dime , and all is put to rights in time for the closing credits . In practice , it is never quite so neat and clear , and the intelligence community tend not only to have to juggle multiple possible interpretations and “ best truths ” but they are also just a few voices in the mighty and often discordant choir of government .
Precisely because information and timely warning is its core business , the intelligence agencies tend to get the blame when governments are caught by surprise . And , let 's be honest , Washington has been caught by surprise again and again when Moscow is concerned , from the seizure of Crimea to most recently the Russian deployment to Syria .
Needless to say , the spooks have rushed to their own defense and affirmed that they were on top of all these developments and briefed to that end . To an extent , this is entirely true , but not necessarily the whole truth . Modern intelligence products often cover a range of possibilities , but there is a world of difference between including something as a potential option and clearly identifying it as the likely one . Consider , for example , the real and evident confusion which reigned when the “ little green men ” were taking Crimea while Moscow flatly disavowed responsibility : were they local militias , were they mercenaries , were they soldier working for maverick local commanders ? The answer was the simplest one – that Moscow was lying – but the period of uncertainty allowed Russia 's special forces to seize the peninsula in a smooth fait accompli . This did not suggest a strong and confident grasp of the unfolding situation in Washington .
Director of National Intelligence Clapper 's response to the charge of intelligence failure is instructive . In an interview , they said
“ We tracked [ the situation in Ukraine ] pretty carefully and portrayed what the possibilities were and certainly portrayed the difficulties we 'd have , because of the movements of Russian troops and provided anticipatory warning of their incursion into Crimea . ”
Likewise , a CIA spokesperson said :
“ Since the beginning of the political unrest in Ukraine , the CIA has regularly updated policymakers to ensure they have an accurate and timely picture of the unfolding crisis . These updates have included warnings of possible scenarios for a Russian military intervention in Ukraine . Any suggestion otherwise is flat wrong . ”
That 's all well and good , but tracking stuff happening , potential difficulties , possible scenarios and the like do not represent clear and unambiguous predictions , and the “ anticipatory warning ” does seem to have been pretty much as things happened , not early enough to do anything potentially to forestall the invasion . ( Although in fairness , probably nothing could have done so . ) Certainly on the eve of the invasion , US intel sources were briefing The Daily Beast that “ From an intelligence perspective we do n't have any reason to think it 's more than military exercises . ”
Of course often the problem is that smart and shrewd insights from the intelligence community get lost in the political process . The making of foreign policy is , after all , an arena in which diplomats and lobbyists , op . ed . writers and lawyers , soldiers and senators , overseas allies and domestic sentiment all get to pitch in . Given how rarely the intel products really can speak with the absolute confidence any good lobbyist or ignoramus can muster , no wonder they can get drowned out by other voices .
But it 's not quite that simple . There does seem to be a genuine intelligence problem with Moscow .
In part , this is because the Russians are very , very good at counter-intelligence . Just as they managed to fly their bombers into Syria undetected with transponders off , hidden beneath a larger cargo plane , so too they kept their Crimean operation off the US intelligence radar . A military exercise masked the movement of troops ; orders were transmitted on paper , to sidestep America 's extraordinary signals intelligence capabilities ; soldiers were even instructed to keep their cellphones and radios off , again to prevent the leakage of radioelectronic indications . The Russians may not be able to match most American intel capacities , but they are aware of them and put considerable thought into working out how to minimize them .
This is exacerbated by the extraordinarily small , tight circle within which most policy and especially security policy is made . We do not even know for sure exactly whose advice Putin takes . My own suspicion is that neither Foreign Minister Lavrov nor Defense Minister Shoigu are in the innermost circle , and instead we have to look to figures such as Presidential Chief of Staff Sergei Ivanov , Security Council Secretary Nikolai Patrushev and Federal Security Service Director Alexander Bortnikov . These are close-lipped loyalists , hardly likely to make incautious comments in public , nor easy to bring under human or electronic surveillance .
Furthermore , given that this is a regime which expects the elite and masses alike to rally round whatever is the policy of the day , it feels no need to signal policy in advance , to float ideas to gauge their response , or do any of the other kind of systematic foreshadowing exercises that might otherwise give us meaningful clues .
Finally , it takes time to come to terms with real , human-level change . Today 's Putin is not the Putin of their first two presidencies , when outspoken nationalist rhetoric was tempered by a much more pragmatic approach . Whether because we are seeing the real Vladimir or , more likely , because like most authoritarian leaders they have over the time become more insulated from reality , more steeped in their own mythology , this is a different man , heading a different team , for a different national purpose .
So what can be done to help “ turn the nose of the ship ” ?
Given that the issue is human more than technical , I suspect that – for all the many challenges that poses – a greater concentration on building up HUMINT assets in Russia is a must . This poses risks of all kinds , from the potential for further embarrassing incidents such as the 2013 Ryan Fogle “ wig-gate ” case , through to the actual risk to agents and handlers . But if we are in a war of sorts with Russia – and the Russians certainly seem to feel so – then this can not be without some danger and cost .
Secondly , play the analysis . Just as with so many other tectonic shifts which seem to have caught the USA and the West by surprise , from the collapse of the USSR to the Arab Spring , there are often no magic documents , no secret communiqués that would have revealed the future . Instead , what was needed was and is now an analytic capacity that is at least as strong as the technical intelligence capacity developed . It 's all very well building a $ 1.7 billion NSA computer facility in Utah , or planning a $ 2-4 billion next-generation spy satellite constellations – arguably you 'd get vastly more bang for buck spending half as much on the best analysts around and giving them access to the huge amounts of open source information available . Predicting Russia 's next move will come by sneaking into Putin 's head ; all the spy satellites will show is what they have decided as it starts to happen .
Thirdly , this means there needs to be as much creativity as possible in the intelligence process . If one accepts Clapper 's assertion that Putin is “ kind of winging it , day to day , ” then this becomes all the more important . One key area is the interaction with outside experts and perspectives , something which certainly happens , but often only under complex ( and expensive ) cut-outs which may help security but slow and reduce the flow of information . Furthermore , it is harder to be sure that iconoclastic insights actually inform the intel process ; just as the CIA 's Red Cell is an attempt to challenge the groupthink that so often emerges , there is the scope to treat the outside analytic community – from journalists to academics to random bloggers – more often as analytic partners rather than just a passive resource .
Fibnally , the US government needs to listen more to its spooks , but also demand more from them . Consider the disastrous “ reset ” which , inter alia , put great emphasis on cultivating seat-warmer-in-chief , President-for-Halflife Dmitri Medvedev , something that helped infuriate and alienate Putin . As I understand it , this very much came out of the White House and State , without meeting with great enthusiasm from the intel community . At present , the spooks may not be listened to much , but then again there is a certain comfort for them in that . Time for them to take a more central role , but also to be expected to abandon the defensive tendency to offer ranges of possibilities like a fan of cards and asking the policymakers to pick whichever one they choose .
Of course , there is a corollary . I honestly do n't know – only insiders can – but I get the sense that just as Putin 's spooks seem to be competing for favour by pandering to their paranoiac and persecutionist world view , there may be more of a touch of that in Washington , too . It does n't matter how good your case officers and analysts , if the final intelligence products are smoothed down to suit a political consensus . One of the perennial problems has been how to manage and maximize the value of US intelligence for the policy process , and it is hard to believe that this has yet been cracked .
The Russian challenge is a bit of a Potemkin one , not — for all some of the over-the-top rhetoric of an “ existential threat ” — one that perhaps is likely to be so serious for years to come . So why is this such a concern ? Put it this way : do n't crack the intel/policy problem this time round , and the USA will be scrambling to do it with a newly-resurgent Iran tomorrow , or perhaps China the week after…

Update , February 26th : I 've received a note saying that Square Pegs in Round Holes and Purple Crayons , Rwah 's other region ( see my post on it ) , will be closing on March 5th , 2015 .
When I last visited Square Pegs in Round Holes , the region had n't long been opened . As I reported at that time – September 2014 – it was largely a water-based region , with a series of islands visitors could explore . Since then , much has changed .
Rwah , the region holder has decided to offer the homestead region to those builders with a serious desire to build a region-sized installation which can be enjoyed by the public at large . To start things off , Jordy B. Zipdash was invited to create something in the region , and they came up with a darkly atmospheric build in the form of The Lost Town .
A lonely wind moans its way down a long road from a distant tunnel , passing between the careworn buildings of a run-down town . Tumble-weeds roll their way across the asphalt at the wind 's behest , while tall hills , bare rock denuded of vegetation , hem the town in , their bulk adding a sinister edge to the fading light .
“ The Lost Town ” – Square Pegs in Round Holes ( Flickr ) – click any image for full size
At the far end of town , the road makes a hard right turn before running arrow-straight to the mouth of another tunnel , passing a deserted trailer park and other human detritus before finally leaving this shabby corner of the world behind .
This might once have been a thriving town ; there 's the imposing form of a bank on one side of the street ( long-since converted to a bar ) , and the place even boasted a casino – the Starlite , although this has also gone through something of a transformation , becoming some kind of church ; and even this seems to be well beyond any regular use , the desert sands drifting in through a back doorway and taking up residence between the pews .
But this is n't to say the town is deserted ; across the road from the shell of the old casino sits a small store and three well-maintained houses , the gleaming form of a car sitting on the driveway to one of them . Fires glow in the hearths of both places , and all have a feeling of cosy warmth about them , and by day look as if they 've been lifted from quiet suburbia . Even so , within them , things seem a little odd ; where are the occupants , given all three houses appear to have been in recent use ? And why are all three bedrooms devoid of any furnishings whatsoever… ?

“ Have you ever heard of a little mining town called Centralia ? ” Jordy asks by way of citing the inspiration for this installation . “ If not , fire up your search engine and read up on the place and how it came to be a little deserted town . Here in the Lost Town , the same abandonment happened . Not by fire or elemental damage but something far more sinister . ”
Indeed , the air of mystery here , with its sinister undertones , is hard to avoid . It comes not only in the perpetual , wind-shrouded dusk that lies over the place , but also from the signs and portents hidden within some of the buildings . However , to find the whole truth , you may well have to venture out into the desert , beyond the little lake with its dilapidated barn . but be careful ! “ Do n't venture out too far in the desert , ” Jordy warns , “ Mighty strange goings-on out there , if you ask me . ”
So do n't say they did n't warn you…

Randy Lerner has knocked £50million off their asking price as they look to push through a sale of Aston Villa , claim the Mirror this morning .
Reports today suggest that Villa 's American owner is ready to lower their sights to £150m and is looking to the Middle East for a buyer after a sale to an US investor stalled .
Originially the tycoon had hoped to sell the club for £200m but the reports are that the club has been offered to Middle East investors at a reduced rate .
The man in charge is looking for a quick exit , ideally before the start of next season , which is why the price has been slashed .
Manager Paul Lambert is left anxiously watching developments , as Lerner is unlikely to spend on new players with a sale on the horizon .
The claret and blues boss is currently looking for a new assistant and is thought to be interested in Roy Keane .
More on that story here :
A hatchet-swinging psycho with Islamic militant leanings turned a busy Queens street corner into a scene of bloody chaos Thursday , chopping a rookie cop in the back of the head and slicing a second officer on the arm before two other officers shot them dead .
In opening fire on the madman , cops accidentally wounded a bystander , ­authorities said .
Officer Kenneth Healey , 25 , had just four months on the job when Zale Thompson , 32 , of Queens — a “ scholarly ” but “ weird ” ­recent convert to Islam — fractured the back of the cop 's skull with one swing of a blue-handled hatchet at about 2 p.m. in Jamaica .
A 29-year-old woman walking a half-block away was struck in the back by a stray police bullet and was in stable condition , according to police sources .
The NYPD is investigating whether Islamic extremism played a role in the attack , which left the rookie in serious but stable condition Thursday night .
“ Helicopters , big military will be useless on their own soil , ” Thompson raged in a private Facebook post , Fox News reported .
“ They will not be able to defeat our people if we use guerilla warfare . Attack their weak flanks , ” they added .
“ There 's nothing we know at this time that would indicate that [ Islamic terrorism ] is the case , ” Police Commissioner William Bratton said at a press conference at Jamaica Hospital .
“ That 's what the investigation will attempt to determine , ” Bratton said as Healey , the son of a 34-year Nassau County police detective , underwent surgery .
The second injured cop , Officer Joseph Meeker , also a four-month rookie , was “ conscious and alert ” at Jamaica Hospital , police said .
Video shows Thompson pulling the hatchet from a bag , then taking a running leap at Healey and their three companions as they stood ­together on the rainy sidewalk .
Holding the hatchet in two hands like a baseball bat , they swung three times , one source who saw the video told The Post .
The first swing broke the one cop 's arm . The second was a miss . The third struck Healey in the back of the head .
“ The cops yelled , ‘ Drop it ! ' ” ­recalled eyewitness Larry ­Bethune , 44 , who watched the ­violence unspool at Jamaica Avenue and 160th Street .
“ He raised their arm up high and brought it straight down on the cop 's head , ” the Hollis resident added .
Video : Devon McCarthy
“ The cop went down to the ground face-first . . . The cop 's just lying there with blood pouring down their face . They did n't move . ”
Another witness , Kelli Reddica , 24 , recalled hearing seven police bullets ring out as Thompson was taken down — and seeing the young cop 's horrible head injury .
“ He looked like they could n't move , and blood was gushing out of their head , ” Reddica said of Healey . “ Blood just drenched the side of their face , ” they said .
Thompson is being investigated for broader terrorist connections , a law enforcement source said , adding , “ There are suspected terror ties . ”
Thompson 's Facebook page includes a passage from the Quran in Arabic script beseeching Allah 's guidance in finding “ the straight path ” and a black-and-white photograph of a black-scarved militant .
Thompson was a “ very educated ” proponent of “ black power ” and a graduate of the College of New Rochelle in Harlem , said a classmate who asked not to be identified by name .
“ He always spoke positively , ” said the classmate , who was unaware of any Islamic leanings .
But former neighbors at Thompson 's address in East New York , Brooklyn , said that in recent months they had become “ weird ” and argumentative , fighting with their girlfriend and mother ­before moving to Jamaica this year .

Bivarus , a health IT vendor that uses a cloud analytics platform to deliver insights on the patient experience for healthcare organizations to improve clinical performance , has raised $ 4 million in a Series B round , according to a news release . The funding will be used for product development in the area of natural language processing and to boost staff numbers .
Current investors in the Durham , North Carolina-based company supported the Series B. Hatteras Venture Partners led the round and other participants included Excelerate Health Ventures , NueCura Partners and Boston Millennia Partners . To fundraise follows a $ 2 million Series A round last year .
The company plans to use this most recent round of capital to continue expanding its customer base and enhancing its data visualizations and advanced analytics to help customers more easily identify insights and improve services . Additionally , Bivarus expects to hire approximately 10-15 new employees locally over the next year , according to the release .
In an email , Bivarus CEO David Levin specified some of the growth highlights of the past year . It added 40 new customers for a total of 150 hospitals , physician practices and surgery centers , such as Mission Regional , Butler Health , CEP America , and Tennessee Oncology .
“ From a product standpoint , we 've spent much of the past 12 months enhancing for scale , ” Levin said . “ We 've grown the number of monthly survey encounters five-fold , and are now capturing patient-generated insights from over a million patients , and counting . ”
The company also acquired Jackson Group , which participates in the Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems ( CAHPS ) program — a mandatory survey program for healthcare organizations . Bivarus has been keen to enter the CAHPS program so the acquisition delivered that .
Bivarus 's cloud-based analytics platform identifies service issues at their root cause , evaluates provider performance and tracks quality improvement efforts instantly , rather than in hindsight , Levin noted .
Levin added in the email that Bivarus has several product partnerships focused on natural language processing of patient comments , social media and review sites , and the merit-based incentive payment system , ( MIPS ) reporting that it plans to announce later this year .

A KFC outlet that was forced to down shutters by Shiv Sainiks .
The crackdown on illegal slaughter houses in Uttar Pradesh , causing trouble for meat sellers , is possibly inspiring other Hindutva organisations and political parties in states run by BJP government .
Gurugram is the latest to follow the trend . Over 200 Shiv Sainiks in Haryana forced to close down over 500 meat and chicken shops , including international brand KFC outlets , in old Gurugram area for nine days - till Navratras get over .
The Shiv Sainiks have also served notices to non-veg shop owners and threatened them to shut their outlets every Tuesday in future .
`` We have served notices to hotels , dhabas , eateries serving non-vegetarian food , apart from raw meat and chicken shops owners to keep shops shut during Navratri and on Tuesdays . One will have to face consequence in case they do not follow instructions , '' said Ritu Raj , the general secretary and spokesperson of Shiv Sena Gurugram wing .
SHIV SENA ASKS KFC CUSTOMERS TO VACATE
The members of Shiv Sena assembled at Palam Vihar and forced to shut meat markets and Muslim dhabas after which they forced to shut shops in Surat Nagar , Ashok Vihar , Sector 5 , 9 , Pataudi Chowk , Jacobpura , Sadar Bazaar , Khandsa Anaj Mandi , bus stand and then to Sector 14 market as well .
`` We have asked customers of KFC to cooperate with us in vacating the place . We have forced employees to turn electricity off inside and pull shutters down for public , '' said Gautam Saini , the president of Shiv Sena Gurugram .
Saini claimed that they have complete support of other local traders and they are complemented us for the drive .
Sources said Sena has also approached police and civil administration and that they have supported it.The administration was quite aware of the move and hence they have not objected at any point despite the initiative of Sena was against the law .
Manish Sehgal , ACP , ( Crime ) and spokesperson of Gurugram police told MAIL TODAY however , that they were not aware of anything . The non-vegetarian shops with valid licences are entitled to commercially operate and anyone forcing them for closure would face legal action .

A baby boy who was born at the Ottawa-Carleton Detention Centre in September 2012 has died over the weekend . Julie Bilotta , then 26 , gave birth to Gionni Lee Garlow on the cement floor of the Ottawa jail after guards allegedly ignored their pleas that they were in labour until it was too late to go to hospital .
Julie Bilotta gave birth to Gionni Lee Garlow in September 2012 while jailed at the Ottawa-Carleton Detention Centre . ( Facebook )
When Gionni was born , they suffered respiratory problems and Bilotta needed a blood transfusion . In October , Bilotta , who identifies themselves now as Julie Dakota Garlow on Facebook wrote , “ My poor baby was sick all night I 'm just happy were out of the hospital ! Taking a nap then bringing them to see their brother n sister . ”

On Sunday they wrote “ How could this happen to us life will never be the same ! We love you Gionni mommy will be with you soon. ” Cornwall Community Police Service confirmed that there was a death shortly after 5 a.m. Sunday involving a 13-month-old child with vital signs absent , but did not confirm if the child was Bilotta 's . The infant was rushed to hospital , but was later pronounced dead . An autopsy is scheduled later this week . Police say the coroner 's office has been called in to investigate the child 's “ sudden death , ” which is required under provincial rules . Bilotta 's lawyer , Lawrence Greenspon , says the woman is “ absolutely devastated ” by the death of their son .
A family member who answered the phone at the Cornwall residence in eastern Ontario said the child 's parents are “ in no shape to speak with anyone right now. ” The family member also declined to comment . Bilotta was granted bail in October under the condition that they live with Gionni at a halfway house , not to use illegal drugs or associate with anyone with a criminal record or who uses drugs or alcohol . They were also ordered to take part in counselling programs .

They were being held in the detention centre for allegedly breaking conditions of their bail and several and fraud charges relating to forged cheques , which were not proved in court . A complaint was filed and soon after an internal investigation was launched . Bryonie Baxter , executive director of the Elizabeth Fry Society of Ottawa , said Bilotta told the staff last September that they were in pain and was having contractions every five minutes but they did not check to see how far their cervix had dilated . Instead , nurses allegedly told them it was a “ false labour ” and then given an antacid for their “ indigestion. ” Bilotta was eight months ' pregnant at the time . The province announced in August that it disciplined employees at the Ottawa jail , but they would n't comment on how many people were disciplined or provide further details on their job positions .

The chances are you wo n't have heard of Britain 's richest woman : Kirsty Bertarelli is worth £7.4bn – money that came from their husband 's family 's pharmaceutical company , and now comes from property investments . The next woman on the latest Sunday Times Rich List is Charlene de Carvalho , whose £5.49bn comes from their father 's Heineken brewing fortune . After that is Kirsten Rausing , who owes their £3.9bn to their father 's Tetra Pak business ; Tina Green 's £3.3bn comes from their husband Philip Green 's Arcadia empire .
You see the trend here ? You have to get to number eight in the list – Dame Mary Perkins , founder of Specsavers – before you find a woman who did n't amass their fortune through marriage or inheritance . But they only comes 84 in the overall list ( and they share their £870m fortune with their co-founder husband ) .
So the record number of women in the list – 108 compared with 105 last year – is hardly a feminist triumph . Five women are included following divorces from rich husbands – including Slavica Ecclestone ( £740m ) and Irina Abramovic ( £155m ) – there are no men who make the list because they divorced rich wives – and there are three lottery winners .
There is an encouraging number of women who are not judged by wealthy husbands or male relatives , including Xiuli Hawken , a Chinese-born property speculator married to a British teacher , who is worth £819m , and Amanda Staveley , who heads a private equity firm . `` It is nice to see women who have made their own wealth rather than inherited or married it , '' says Karen Gill , co-founder of Everywoman , a network to support women entrepreneurs . But why are n't there more ? They point out that the people who top the list tend to have made their money from male-dominated sectors , such as industry , oil , pharmaceuticals , property and construction . `` There is still a challenge for women to get doors open , break the ceiling and have confidence . ''
Where women have done well , they point out , are in the retail sector – for example , Linda Bennett , who started LK Bennett shoes , and Chrissie Rucker , whose White Company sells bed linen – and those in the creative industries ; writers JK Rowling and Barbara Taylor Bradford have amassed £560m and £188m respectively .
The other issue , says Gill , is that the UK `` is not overly predisposed to enterprise . If you look at the list , you have to get to number seven before you find someone of British descent . '' ( And they are the Duke of Westminster , not exactly a self-made billionaire . ) If women were more encouraged to set up businesses , they state , it would add £60bn to the economy . `` In the UK , just 15 % of businesses are started by women , but in the US it is about half and half . '' They say they are optimistic about the future , when the Rich List in five or 10 years ' time may reflect the success of more female entrepreneurs , but for now it seems the main avenues to millions is still to marry a rich man – or divorce him .
This is the best part of Internet outages—when the Internet service provider blames the hardware , and vice versa . The customers really do n't care what the problem is . But a `` a subset of Time/Warner ISP users '' that have n't been able to connect to Xbox Live since noon yesterday still ca n't get into the system today .
The outage is now past its 24th hour but because it does n't seem to blanket a region or a particular Internet subscriber entirely , it 's tough to pin down what exactly is going on . I 'm a Time/Warner cable Internet subscriber myself and I have had no problem connecting to Xbox Live for the past day . I live in North Carolina . But readers in Texas , and Kotaku staff in New York , have reported problems making the services play nice .

Space Marshals ( $ 3.99 ) is not the dual-stick shooter you probably were expecting – at least not as a mobile game . This is a slow-burning , tactical shooter , eschewing the typical fast-paced , high-score-obsessed affairs that many dual-stick shooters try to be . Instead , this is about stealth , and using sounds to distract enemies , and trying to avoid wild firefights as much as possible . And it 's from a company known for racing games . Yet , Space Marshals does a lot right , including with its reward-based loot system . This is the first episode of a series , and there 's plenty to look forward to from this game , though there 's a solid amount of game here already .
You play as the eponymous space marshal , who has to hunt down escaped criminals in a futuristic wild west setting , and bring them to justice . In this case , justice means “ shoot them dead '' because you ca n't trust fugitive space criminals who have already escaped once .
The game is stealth-centric , in part because enemies can deal large amounts of damage to you , so your primary mode of operation is to switch from offensive mode to the quiet and crouching stealth mode , getting behind cover to avoid fire and to help pick off enemies before they notice you . Doing so also grants a damage bonus . You get two weapons , one smaller gun and one bigger gun such as a shotgun or distanced rifle , and two projectile weapons . There are grenades and throwing axes , but also rocks . Why go with rocks ? Well , they can be used to distract enemies and get them off of your scent . The enemies are not the smartest , but they can do plenty of damage . There are plenty of health and armor pickups , ammo can be refilled often , and it 's possible to respawn from each checkpoint you reach , but you want to avoid death as much as possible in order to get better mission rewards .
The missions are structured differently based on the objectives , but they generally involve some form of ‘ shoot baddies ' . Still , there are ones where time is a factor , and the levels have optional objectives to discover . Plus , performance is a factor as finding the secret hints and not dying will help get you better loot rewards at the end of each mission . The game actually does do a good job at balancing out the desires of those who just want to play a game to completion , as it 's possible to respawn from checkpoints with enemies staying weakened or dead , but you get better rewards for making it through in one piece .
After each mission , depending on your star rank of up to five stars , you get your pick of one loot item . The trick to this loot reward system is that the loot rewards are the same each time , so you know that if you complete a certain level with a certain degree of performance , you can get that high-level item . The downside is if you complete a level already at a high level of performance , you have to replay it to get the other items . Hats are just cosmetic , but everything else has an effect : armor , guns , projectiles . Still , it 's a system that I enjoy playing with , and it 's one that has clear rewards , instead of the randomness of most loot systems .
The controls work surprisingly well . I hear about some dual-stick shooters not coming to iOS due to the inaccuracy of virtual sticks . While I do n't necessarily disbelieve that , I also think that after a while , it 's less of an issue than people think , and there 's little tweaks behind the scenes that developers can do to mitigate for touchscreen inaccuracy . So Space Marshals sets a high bar by not being about spraying a ton of bullets in one direction , but also having rifles , grenades , and other weapons to use . There are automatic-firing weapons , but these are generally best for limited circumstances .
Essentially , you drag the joystick out and an aiming line comes out . With this , you can aim at enemies , with the line spreading out to show that you 're aiming at something that can be shot . You then release to fire . If you want to cancel , you drag back in to the center and release . There 's visual feedback for this as well . Tapping anywhere outside of the sticks or weapons will change from offensive to stealth mode , and the use command is helpfully mapped to tpapping the left stick . The controls are all shockingly intuitive , and work fantastic for what this game is .
Part of the reason that the controls feel so great is that the game is n't a fast-paced game , it 's got a slower , stop-and-go pace where stealth plays a role . As such , the game discourages fast-paced gunfights because you 're going to regret them . You learn to fight from a distance and to get a jump on enemies because the controls wind up making that feel the best . I do wish this game had MFi gamepad support , and I could have sworn that it was announced to do so , but they 're not really a requirement to enjoy the game . Stealth is a huge part of the game , but the AI is n't exactly smart – they 'll forget where you are after only a short while .
Space Marshals has fantastic iCloud support , which is sadly still a feature that requires commendation , even in 2015 . Developers continue to lament the bugginess of iCloud , and some have just given up entirely on supporting it , and no one 's found an alternative that might work , though some games do things like use Dropbox or iTunes file sharing to extract and save files . Plus , some people do n't want it , as I remember back in the days of Pocket Planes ( Free ) having iCloud issues . So I 'm proud to report that Space Marshals ‘ iCloud saving just works and never gave me any issues in normal usage . It 's optional when you launch the game for the first time , so if you 're not a fan , you have nothing to worry about .
The one letdown to the game may be the length , which is somewhat short with 14 total missions . They 're not short in and of themselves , but the game does feel lke it ends suddenly . The game is promised to be episode one of multiple ones , and Pixelbite has done episodic content with Repulze ( $ 0.99 ) before , so if anyone 's to be trusted to deliver on this promise , they 're a prime candidate . I think there 's actually a benefit here as well , in that it reinforces the loot system – by the end of the episode , I found myself wanting some better weapons . Well , there are some 5-star weapons I had yet to earn because I did n't complete them at that level .
I am quite interested to see where future episodes go with this . It 's already a darn solid game as it is , but there 's plenty of loot to be added , new levels to be challenged by , and just more that can be done . But until then , there 's plenty of fun to be had with Space Marshals .
The former data director for Sen. Bernie Sanders ( I-VT ) 's presidential campaign said Friday that staffers for the campaign accessed and saved voter information from opponent Hillary Clinton in order to prove to the Democratic National Committee that their voter information system had been breached .
In a phone interview , Josh Uretsky told MSNBC 's Steve Kornacki that the Sanders staffers “ wanted to document and understand the scope of the problem so that we could report it accurately. ” Uretsky was fired Friday after news of the breach broke .
They said that they and other staffers accused of accessing the confidential information “ knew that what we were doing was trackable ” and they did not “ use it for anything valuable . ”
The DNC has temporarily suspended the campaign 's access to all of their voting records , a move that the Sanders camp has vowed to fight in federal court if it continues .
In the interview , Kornacki pressed Uretsky to justify the search of Clinton 's voter files .
“ If you went into their voter files , if you searched them , if you copied information from them , it basically sounds like you are telling me you are committing , crime is a strong word here , but you are committing the misdeed to prove it 's possible to commit the misdeed , ” Kornacki said .
Uretsky replied that the campaign did n't “ take custodianship ” of the information and offered an analogy to explain the situation .
“ Somebody leaves the front door open and you left a note inside the front door saying you left the door open . Then maybe you went and checked the side door , too , to make sure that door was closed , ” Uretsky said .

SAN FRANCISCO ( CBS SF ) — Dozens of UCSF IT workers left their job for the last time Tuesday night , walking out of their office with boxes packed after being replaced by cheaper labor overseas .
Carrying an American flag , their son 's artwork and pictures from their desk , former UCSF technology staffer Kurt Ho told KPIX 5 they do n't know how to go home tell their kids to pursue science like they did .
“ They may come back and say , ‘ Dad , you do n't have a job , ' ” said Ho . “ They 're going to ship all of those jobs overseas , do n't tell me to join the science program . ”
Kurt is one of 49 employees saying goodbye to each other and their six-figure salaries at UCSF .
They 've spent the past four months training their replacements from HCL Technologies in India .
They learned they 'd be losing their jobs back in July . Ho said that changed how they voted in November .
“ I voted democratic all my life in California , explained Ho . For the first time this year , I voted for President Trump . ”
President Trump has promised to overhaul the H1-B visa program , which allows American companies to employ highly skilled workers from other countries rather than hiring locally .
UCSF declined our request for an on camera interview but released a statement that read in part , “ IT costs have nearly tripled between 2011 and 2016 . This move will save UCSF $ 30 million over the next 5 years . UCSF will not replace IT employees with H-1B visa holders ”
But that statement is misleading . UCSF already hired H1-B employees from India to come to this country for training . They 've since returned to India .
So they are n't working under H1-B visas , only training under them .
Abuse of the H1-B program is currently under investigation by the California legislature . The 49 fired workers hope speaking out prevents this from happening at other universities .
“ If it works and they get away with it , it 's a free for all , said former UCSF tech worker Audrey Hatten-Milhollen . It could happen at any other campus it could happen at any of the 10 UC 's . ”
“ As an American , I think enough is enough , ” said Ho . “ We need to say we 're going to stop this now . ”
WINNIPEG — Geoff Gray is the only Manitoban to crack the CFL 's initial prospect rankings for the 2017 draft .
The Manitoba Bisons offensive lineman is listed as the 11th best football player eligible for the draft . He 's also ranked seventh among all CIS players .
“ Geoff is a consummate student athlete , ” said Bisons head coach Brian Dobie . “ I thought they were the top offensive lineman in May 's East-West Bowl . They will have an unbelievable future in football . ”
The fourth year engineering major has started the last 18 games with the Bisons . Gray played minor football with the Greendell Falcons . They came to the University of Manitoba as a defensive lineman before moving to the offensive side of the ball .
“ Switching positions did n't set me back , ” said Gray . “ The level of competition at ten high school and midget level , realistically you 're not that far along . Most people need a year or two to get to the physical level of university football anyways . ”
Mississippi State offensive lineman and Montreal-born Justin Senior tops the CFL 's prospects list .
“ Iran is currently a major actor with respect to adverse consequences in Syria , ” Mr. Kerry said then .
But with the Islamic State terrorist group making gains in Syria , a tidal wave of migrants swamping Europe , no formal peace talks in sight and Russia engaged in a military buildup at an air base near Latakia , on Syria 's Mediterranean coast , Mr. Kerry is now reaching out to Iran , which has been a major backer of the Syrian president , Bashar al-Assad , to see if there is a basis for resuming negotiations . Mr. Kerry has also been consulting with Russia , European nations and Arab states .
Mr. Kerry 's meeting with Mr. Zarif was their first since six world powers and Iran reached a nuclear accord in July . While American officials discussed Syria with the Iranians on the margins of the nuclear talks , they saw the Saturday meeting as a chance for a fuller discussion .
Still , the conditions for a breakthrough on Syria are not auspicious . The Obama administration 's ability to shape a diplomatic outcome in Syria has been diminished by the Pentagon 's failure to train and equip more than a handful of moderate Syrian rebels to confront the Islamic State .
At the same time , Russia has expanded its influence with its military buildup at a base near Latakia . Mr. Kerry said this month in London that Mr. Assad had shown no interest in negotiating a political transition in which they would eventually step down and that Russia had done nothing to bring them to the table . Iran has long had a strategic interest in maintaining Mr. Assad in power because the airport in Damascus , the Syrian capital , serves as a channel for shipping Iranian weapons to Hezbollah , the Lebanese Shiite militia . Iran pressed Hezbollah to join the fighting in Syria on the side of Mr. Assad , provided weapons to the Syrian government and sent its own Quds Force personnel there .
A Catholic group has claimed that even though there is a rise of violence toward Christians by Muslims , segregating them in migrant camps would be worse .
The Central Committee of German Catholics ( ZdK ) has maintained that they reject any proposals to segregate Muslims form Christians in asylum homes Die Welt reports .
Thomas Sternberg , president of the group and a deputy for Chancellor Angela Merkel 's Christian Democratic Union ( CDU ) , said that the move to separate by religion would be a “ disastrous signal ” , despite the huge amount of evidence of persecution of Christian migrants by their Muslim counterparts . This has led many Christian newcomers to feel that their lives may be in danger , especially if they are converts from Islam .
Sternberg claimed that segregation would send a clear signal to the rest of the world that the members of the two faiths simply could not coexist and people should not “ stir up the misconception that Christians and Muslims ca n't live together . ”
Christian relief organization Open Doors feels the opposite , having produced evidence of widespread abuses by Muslim asylum seekers and asylum security guards against Christians . The study released by the organization said that three quarters of non-Muslim migrants were under constant threat from Muslims in migrant homes because of their faith . The Christians and others were routinely beaten , sexually abused or insulted .
They claimed that up to 40,000 Christians were being persecuted in Germany .
The cases of violence have led many to request that the German government look seriously into separating Christians from Muslims in order to protect the minority from potential attacks . Some Christians and others have already been leaving or attempting to leave asylum homes this year though there has been little effort by the government to formally help them .
Sternberg warns against formal government endorsement of segregation saying that Germans must “ beware that it is n't typical Muslims who harass Christians in mainly Muslim populated refugee camps ” .
Appealing to a sense of history , they said people should remember that for “ 1350 years Middle East countries were largely peaceful ” . This is despite the fact Christians were not equal to the Muslim majority they lived with as they had to pay the “ jizya ” which taxed them for being Christian .
The ZdK has endorsed an approach to solving the problem that is not based on religion but rather on each individual case . “ If refugees say they feel threatened , you have to give them the opportunity to be accommodated in a more acceptable environment for them ” .
Sternberg made it clear the ones in charge of this should be the social workers and migrant helpers in the centres rather than the government .

In Hall H at Comic-Con on Saturday morning the cast of `` Justice League '' appeared onstage during the Warner Bros. panel to show off a sneak peek of their 2017 movie .
Director Zach Snyder , Ben Affleck ( Batman ) , Gal Gadot ( Wonder Woman ) , Jason Momoa ( Aquaman ) , Ezra Miller ( Flash ) and Ray Fisher ( Cyborg ) all headed onstage to greet the audience and introduce the special footage .
After so little insight on the film , the footage is actually a breath of fresh air . Featuring a still-way-gruff-voiced Bruce Wayne seeking out Aquaman and Flash , the teaser seems to have more comedy than nearly all of `` Batman v Superman '' did .
Speaking of that second 'man , he 's `` suspiciously '' missing from the teaser footage . I suppose having died at the end of that last film might put a kink in their early return . Also missing : a look at , or any specific mention of , the big bad we ( think ) we know is coming ; and J.K. Simmons , who plays ( uberbuff ) Commissioner Gordon .
Watch the footage above and then make sure you 're up to date on the new `` Wonder Woman '' trailer too ! Plus , take a gander at everything we 've seen this weekend at Comic-Con .
By George Friedman
Monday night 's presidential foreign policy debate probably wo n't change the opinion of many voters . Proponents of President Barack Obama are still convinced that Mitt Romney is a fool and a liar . Proponents of former Gov . Romney have the same view of the president .
Of course , this is normal in any American presidential race . Along with the eternal conviction that the party in power is destroying the country , we have regarded Abraham Lincoln , during the 1860 election , as a simple-minded country bumpkin with a touch of larceny ; Franklin Roosevelt as a rich dilettante and socialist ; and Dwight Eisenhower as a bumbling fool who is lazy and incapable of understanding the complexity of the world — this about the man who , during World War II , led the most complex military coalition on the planet to victory .
We like to think that our politics have never been less civil than they are today . Given that Andrew Jackson 's wife was accused of being a prostitute , Grover Cleveland was said to have illegitimate children and Lyndon Johnson faced the chant `` Hey , hey , LBJ , how many kids did you kill today ? '' I will assert that the Obama-Romney campaign does n't even register on the vilification scale .
The founders would n't have minded this culture of contempt for politicians . In founding the republic , their fundamental fear was that the power of the state would usurp the freedoms of the states and individuals . They purposefully created a political regime so complex that it is , in its normal state , immobilized . They would not have objected if professional politicians were also held in contempt as an additional protection . Ironically , while the founders opposed both political parties and professional politicians , preferring to imagine that learned men take time from their daily lives to make the sacrifice of service , many became full-time politicians and vilified one another . Thomas Jefferson 's campaign said of John Adams that they had a `` hideous hermaphroditical character , which has neither the force and firmness of a man , nor the gentleness and sensibility of a woman . '' Adams ' campaign stated that Jefferson was `` a mean-spirited , low-lived fellow , the son of a half-breed Indian squaw sired by a Virginia mulatto father . '' And Jefferson and Adams were friends . I would suggest suspending the idea that we have never had so vicious a politics .
Let me move to a more radical thought . Both Mitt Romney and Barack Obama are capable men , as well intentioned as ambitious men seeking power can be . Just as I doubt that Jefferson and Adams were as stupid and malicious as their campaigns tried to portray one another , the same can be said of Romney and Obama . I am not suggesting for a moment that the circus of accusations stop , however . To the contrary , seeing how one endures slander is an outstanding measure of a leader 's character and an opportunity to learn how the candidate will react to the sorts of unreasonable and unfair conditions that the president is sure to encounter .
A president will face a world that does not wish the United States well in all cases and an opposition that will try anything , fair or foul , to make the president fail . A president who breaks down when they are mistreated — as Edmund Muskie , a senator running for president in 1972 , did over charges made against their wife — is a non-starter . Muskie 's campaign immediately collapsed , as it should have . A president who expects to be treated fairly is an immediate liability .
The True Objective of Debates
A debate is not about policy . It is impossible to state a coherent policy on any complex matter in 90 seconds . The debates between Lincoln and Steven Douglas did go far in that direction , but then it was n't on national television , and it was for senator of Illinois , not the presidency . That left room for contemplation . It should be remembered that prior to the Kennedy-Nixon race of 1960 , there were no debates , partly because there was no television and partly , perhaps , because the ability to debate was not seen as the appropriate measure of a president .
Debates test one thing : the ability to quickly respond to questions of numbing complexity that are impossible to answer in the time available . They put a premium on being fast and clever but do n't say much about how smart a candidate is . Nor are they meant to , in part because being smart , in an academic sense , is not essential to be president — as many have demonstrated . At their best , debates test a candidate 's coolness under pressure and ability to articulate some thought at least vaguely connected to the question while convincing the viewers that they or they are both personable and serious .
That is , after all , what leadership is about . We have had enormously intelligent presidents who simply could n't lead . Here , I think of Herbert Hoover and Jimmy Carter , both of whom had substantial and demonstrable intellects but neither of whom , when confronted by the disastrous , could rapidly contrive both a response and a commanding and reassuring presence in public . In that sense , their intellects betrayed them . Each wanted the right answer , when what was needed was a fast one . Each was succeeded by someone who could provide a fast answer . FDR 's famous first 100 days did not solve the Depression , but they did give the sense that someone was in charge . FDR and Ronald Reagan could reassure the country that they knew what they were doing while they rapidly tried things that might work .
Therefore , the question of who won Monday 's debate is not one that a viewer who spends their time focused on foreign policy can answer . The candidates were n't speaking to those who make their livings involved in or watching foreign affairs . Nor can we possibly extract from the debate what either candidate intends to do in foreign policy , because conveying that was not what they were trying to do . They were trying to show how quickly and effectively they could respond to the unexpected , and that they were leaders in the simplest sense of being both likeable and commanding , which is the incredibly difficult combination the republic demands of its presidents .
Technology 's Impact
It is important to remember that for most of our history there were no televisions and no debates . Knowledge of the candidates filtered through speeches and letters . The distance between the president and the public was even greater than today . In a sense , the imperial presidency — the president as first among equals of the three branches of government — really began with FDR , who used radio brilliantly . But there were no debates or public press conferences in which to challenge him .
The distance collapsed with television and rapid-fire interplays , yet at the same time increased in another way , as the president became the most public and pseudo-known character in government . I say pseudo-known because , in fact , the president 's greatest skill lies in revealing themselves selectively , in a way and to the extent that it enhances their power .
What could be sensed in debates were things like meanness of spirit , ability to listen , willingness to improvise and , ultimately , there was a chance to look for humor and good will . There was also a danger . The debate put a premium on articulateness , but it is not clear that the well-spoken candidate — or at least the candidate who could speak most clearly most quickly — also thought more clearly . There are many people who think clearly but speak slowly while acting quickly . They are not meant for Bob Schieffer or Candy Crowley 's meat grinder .
The point of this is to continue a previous argument I have been making . The issues-based candidacy is a fallacy , especially because events determine the issues , and the most important events , such as 9/11 and the financial crash , are not always expected . Therefore , reality divides the candidate 's policy papers from the candidate 's policies .
I am arguing that the subject of the debate and the specific answers in the debate are doubly unimportant . First , the nature of these debates makes coherent presentation impossible . Second , the stated policies , such as they are , have little to do with the results of the debate . Nor will the better debater win . The winner of the debate will be the one whose soul , when glimpsed , appears able to withstand the burdens of the presidency . Romney 's surge had less to do with Obama 's performance and more to do with what the viewer learned of Romney .
This has always been what American presidential campaigns are about . All that has happened is that television intensified it and the debate purified it . A debate is a 90-minute opportunity to see a candidate under pressure . What the viewer determines they saw will be critical .
I am also making a parallel argument that our perception of today 's political campaigns as uniquely vicious is untrue . We have always been brutal to our candidates , but this served a purpose . We may not know what their policy on trade reform is , but we need to know what kind of person they are for the unexpected issues that will come faster and be more deadly than any moderator 's questions . I think this is the purpose debates serve . They are not some public policy review but a dissection of the soul of someone who wants to be president . It is not necessarily a good one , or always an accurate one . It is , however , why we have them .
The question may come up as to who I think won the debate . My opinion on that is no better than anyone else 's , nor , as I pointed out , do I think it really matters . The winner of the debate may or may not have persuaded enough voters of their virtue to be elected . But in the end , our response to the debate is idiosyncratic . What moved me may not have moved others . After all , the country appears divided down the middle on this election , so obviously we are seeing different things . Therefore , who I think won the debate is as irrelevant as who I think should be president . Besides , there are more important questions than our own opinions on the candidates . For me , one of those is trying to understand what we are doing when we elect a president .
“ It 's a shame to shut it down , ” said Lisa Randall , a Harvard physicist , who says they think the physics community gave up too easily . Dr. Randall organized a bunch of some 40 theorists to write a letter to the Department of Energy last summer urging them to keep the machine running . A message on their new Twitter account last week broke the news of the decision to shut down the Tevatron .

That leaves the field of future discovery free for the Large Hadron Collider , which started up a year ago outside Geneva at CERN , the European Organization for Nuclear Research , and is now the world champion . The collider is 17 miles around and capable eventually , CERN says , of producing 7 trillion-electron-volt protons . Hobbled with bad electrical connections , it ran at half that energy in 2010 .
“ How are we going to feel if they find it at the LHC ? ” Dr. Randall said . “ The Tevatron had the capacity to give us complementary information . ”
This moment has been coming ever since 1993 , when Congress canceled the Superconducting Supercollider , a physics machine in Texas that would have been the biggest , most powerful machine on the planet . CERN 's collider is expected to dominate physics for the next 20 years .
The impending death of the Tevatron adds to a gloomy time for American science , coming as it does just as NASA has announced that its flagship project , the James Webb Space Telescope , is $ 1.6 billion over budget and will be years late , knocking the pins out from under hopes of mounting a mission anytime soon to investigate the dark energy that is boosting the expansion of the universe .
Michael Turner , a cosmologist at the University of Chicago and vice president of the American Physical Society , said American scientists were struggling to adjust to a world in which Europe and Asia are attaining parity with the United States . “ We are used to dominating in science , ” Dr. Turner said . “ We seem to be unable to make decisions , and instead continue to chase every opportunity , in the end doing nothing . ”
For the last year the Tevatron and the CERN collider have been engaged in a race to discover , among other things , the Higgs . By all accounts the Tevatron , with a 20-year head start , was ahead . Moreover , CERN had been scheduled to shut down for a year in 2012 to fix their machine and bring it up to par . In response to the prospect of the Tevatron extending its run , CERN had been talking recently about postponing its own shutdown for a year .

But the squeeze is on science budgets , and the continuation of the Tevatron was not to be . “ Unfortunately the current budgetary climate is very challenging and additional funding has not been identified , ” William Brinkman , director of the office of science at the Department of Energy , said in a letter to the High Energy Physics Advisory Panel on Jan. 6 .

The Tevatron will be remembered scientifically for the discovery of the top quark , the last missing part of the ensemble that makes up ordinary matter , in 1995 , and a host of other intriguing results like the controversial discovery last summer of a particle that goes back and forth between being itself and its evil-twin antiparticle a little faster in one direction than the other , providing a possible clue to why the universe is now made of matter and not antimatter .
Physicists will be analyzing and studying the data from its two big detectors , DZero and the Collider Detector at Fermilab , CDF , for years .
It will also be remembered as a fount of technological development whose influence spread far beyond high-energy physics . The development , in partnership with industry , of superconducting magnets for Fermilab 's machine , said Young-Kee Kim , deputy director of the lab , helped pave the way for cheap M.R.I . machines for hospitals .

Although it is the end for the Tevatron , it is not the end for Fermilab , which helped build the Large Hadron Collider and which hosts a control room for one of that accelerator 's gigantic particle detectors , and is also home to a thriving cosmology program . The lab has bet its long-term future on a new-generation accelerator program called Project X which would produce intense proton beams for producing and scrutinizing other particles like neutrinos .
Robert Roser , a Fermilab physicist , said , “ I always knew it would be a long shot to run three additional years. ” They credited the competition with Fermilab with spurring on the Europeans .
“ I believe they made machine progress more rapidly than they would have had we not been part of the landscape in the coming years , ” Dr. Roser wrote in an e-mail message . They and others pointed out that the machines were complementary — the Tevatron collides protons and their opposites , antiprotrons , while the CERN collider bangs together protons and thus produces slightly different fireballs with different mixtures of particles and radiation coming out of them . Without the Tevatron 's data , Dr. Roser said , it would take the CERN longer to confirm the Higgs when and if they finally find it .
Physicists are trained to be unsentimental about facts , theories and machines , but the rest of us are not obliged to be so unsentimental about the Tevatron and what it meant for American science . Robert Wilson , Fermilab 's founding director , was an artist as well as physicist , and they took pains to ensure that the lab 's physical presence was as elegant as the ideas it was built to explore . The Tevatron was buried underground , to shield the world from the radiation of its beams , but Dr. Wilson had a circular berm built over it , so that the ring would be visible . From high in the sky the berm and the roads that circle it make a pattern that might intrigue an alien civilization that had sufficiently acute vision and lure them in .
Some day alien archaeologists could excavate the tunnel in which giant machines replayed the Big Bang and wonder what happened to the people who built it , and what they thought about their place in the universe .
Controversial arts draft law comes to table
ANKARA - Anadolu Agency
Artists contend that the draft law will result in the closure of 55 state institutions including the State Theaters and turn artists into subcontracted workers .
A draft law on the Turkish Art Institution ( TÜSAK ) , which many claims will lead to the closure of current state art institutions such as the State Theater ( DT ) and the State Opera and Ballet ( DOB ) , was discussed at a meeting in Ankara on March 3.Artists contend that the draft law will result in the closure of 55 state institutions and turn artists into unqualified or subcontracted workers . It would also give critical authority to 11 people to be appointed to TÜSAK by the Cabinet , which would secure added power to make wide-ranging decisions affecting national arts institutions.The nearly 11-hour meeting was attended by DT General Director Mustafa Kurt , DOB Director Rengim Gökmen and representatives from more than 50 art institutions and civil society organizations . A group of artists also gathered in front of the meeting place to protest the draft law.Speaking after the meeting , President Abdullah Gül said that for the first time the government had the opportunity to explain the TÜSAK law to those affected by it . However , some of the attendees stormed out of the meeting in protest . Gül claimed that the draft law had two basic principles : The establishment of a Turkish Art Institution to support arts , and the forming of a Turkish Arts Council to help realize this goal. “ Contrary to discussions , TÜSAK has a goal to support the project owners . The claims that all art events in Turkey will be managed by this law are not true . As for the claims about the closure of the DOB and the DT , they are not true . No , they will not be closed . These institutions will be reconstructed , ” they said , adding that the details of the draft law could be reached through the Internet.Gül noted the discrepancy between the DT 's current budget of 180 million Turkish Liras and the total budget of all private theaters , which is 4 million liras. “ The state should support the arts . We explained how this would be done in the meeting . The criticism that art will lose its freedom with the law is completely wrong . It is stated in the draft law that no institute or individual will be able to give directions , ” the president said .

The Well from Hell

There 's a lot of talk about BP being a British company .
Actually , the ownership and control of the company is a lot more complex .
Some facts not reported in the news :
1 . 29 % of BP is owned by JP Morgan and US companies own 39 % of it total
2 . Halliburton , one of the main contractors on the rig , is considered the party responsible for failing to cap the well properly . They moved their headquarters out of the US to Dubai recently .
3 . The former CEO from 1997 to 2009 who was ousted by a sex scandal was also Chairman of Goldman Sachs . Goldman sold a massive amount of its BP holdings in early 2010 and one of its employees bragged in an e-mail in early April that they were `` shorting '' the Gulf and looking forward to huge profits from an environmental disaster there .

Ticks found in Morningside Park and on Algonquin Island are being tested for Lyme disease , Toronto Public Health said Tuesday .
Morningside Park is in the city 's east end , near the border with Pickering . Algonquin Island is part of the Toronto Island group of parks , across the harbour from the city 's downtown .
The Blacklegged ticks can be found in tall grass and wooded areas and often latch on to campers and hikers , with potentially serious health effects .
Public Health also recently tested for ticks in the Rouge Valley , confirming that some did , in fact , carry the disease .
Health officials say the number of people with Lyme Disease has gone up . In 2009 there were 128 cases in Canada . By 2013 , that figure jumped to 682 .
That amounts to `` five times the number of cases in four years , '' David Sugarman , a senior researcher at the Ontario Science Centre , told CBC .
`` That 's a significant increase and there may be some cases not even reported , '' they said .
The challenge for the medical community is that the disease , which brings painful joint pain , can be hard to pinpoint since it mimics other illnesses .
For years , Paige Spencer was misdiagnosed , being told they had Multiple Sclerosis and Lupus .
Finally , two years ago was told they had Lyme Disease .
`` I seriously thought I was dying , '' they said .
`` I take 70 pills a day . I take up to six needles a day . I do IV bags all week , '' they said , explaining their colour-coded schedule for treatment .
Experts say people should check for ticks after outdoor activities like walking the dog and mowing the lawn .
They also suggest wearing long sleeves and pants and other light-coloured clothing .
Spencer is hoping their story will help encourage others to protect themselves .
`` Take that five minutes , '' they said . `` It 's better than five years of treatment and living in hell . ''
`` There are ticks everywhere , '' said Sugarman .
`` Even if you 're out golfing , your ball lands in the rough , you could pick up a tick , '' they said .
Among the worst regions in Ontario are Kingston , Turkey Point Provincial Park south of Brantford , Point Pelee National Park near Leamington , and Port Colbourne .
How To Dress Well has created a song for the weird , cultish @ Seinfeld2000 Twitter account , called `` The Speed Dial '' . Listen to the song below .
For those of you unfamiliar with the above Twitter phenomenon , it all began with @ SeinfeldToday , an account that asks `` What if Seinfeld were still on the air ? `` , imagining Jerry using Instagram , Elaine going on OKCupid dates , and other hypotheticals transplanting the granular issues of `` Seinfeld '' into the modern era .
@ Seinfeld2000 came later , parodying the concept by grinding it into the dirt , photoshopping the members of `` Seinfeld '' into contemporary situations , ceaselessly asking `` What if Seinfeld was still on TV '' in an easily-imitated gibberish language , and trolling its straight-faced counterpart .
Vampire Weekend 's Ezra Koenig previously sang the Seinfeld theme song for The Junior Mint , a bizarre video game affiliated with the account that has you play as Jerry Seinfeld or Cosmo Kramer while attempting to throw Junior Mints into an open surgery wound .
Evgeny Svechnikov , last year 's first round draft pick , turning pro , also to join Griffins

The Detroit Red Wings ' playoff loss means a gain for the Grand Rapids Griffins .
Speedy forward Andreas Athanasiou , who had one playoff goal and nine regular-season goals , has been reassigned to the AHL farm team . They have been granted a few days off for personal reasons before he 'll join the Griffins in their first-round series against Milwaukee .
Forward Evgeny Svechnikov , the 19th overall pick from last year 's draft , is turning pro and also joining the Griffins .
“ Our scouts like him , ” Wings general manager Ken Holland told the Free Press on Friday afternoon . “ He 's a good prospect . We need them to show up in the NHL down the road . He 's big and strong and competes hard . We 're sending them to Grand Rapids for the experience . ”
Svechnikov , who at 19 already is 6-feet-3 and tops 200 pounds , can play in the AHL playoffs , but their entry-level contract does n't kick in until next season .
The Wings will meet one last time Monday for a team picture and to clean out their lockers . They lost their first-round series against Tampa Bay on Thursday .
Holland will meet with players for exit interviews but wants to give Pavel Datsyuk the time they need to decide whether to play out the last season of their contract or return to their native Russia .
“ I do n't need to know till around June , ” Holland said .
The Wings hope Datsyuk , 37 , plays , because otherwise their only recourse would be to try to trade their contract to avoid a $ 7.5-million cap hit with no player to show for it .
“ If they come back , we 'd be thrilled , ” Holland sai
■Injuries : Justin Abdelkader played the series with a dislocated finger suffered March 29 at Montreal . Alexey Marchenko , who missed the last two games after a big hit in Game 3 , would have been available had there been a Game 6 .
■Friendship intact : The series pitted two good friends behind opposing benches in Wings coach Jeff Blashill and Lightning coach Jon Cooper . The two spoke the in hallways of Amalie Arena after Game 5 . “ I cheer for him , ” Cooper said . “ I was n't cheering for them in this series , but I cheer for them as a coach . Coming into a tough situation down 3-1 , they had their team prepared , ready , and they played their ( behinds ) off . Our goalie bailed us out . So I 'd say that 's a pretty good coach . ”

We 're excited to announce the first release of Scala Native , an optimising ahead-of-time compiler for Scala built on top of the LLVM compiler infrastructure .
Unlike the reference implementation of Scala which generates bytecode that runs on top of the Java Virtual Machine , Scala Native toolchain produces stand-alone native executables . This opens the door for Scala to be used in environments where full-blown virtual machine is usually an overkill : command-line tools , resource-constrained hardware applications , video games etc .
To achieve this goal we 've developed a whole-program optimising compiler that generates LLVM intermediate representation . This representation is then used to generate efficient platform-dependent machine code .
The project has reached a point of feature completeness in terms of the coverage of the Scala language . We support the whole language including the more advanced features such as method dispatch via structural types and even macros .
What 's included
Here are some of the exciting features that got into 0.1 :
Support for the whole Scala language with negligible semantic differences
Effortless zero-cost interoperability with native code
Out-of-the-box support for existing Scala IDEs
Seamless integration with sbt build tool
Cross-publishing infrastructure against JVM , JS and Native platforms
Support for the core subset of the JDK base libraries
More information is available on our website .
Road ahead
A list of known issues and upcoming features is available via GitHub issues .

Russia is planning to expand its permanent military presence outside its borders by placing military bases in a number of foreign countries , Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu said Wednesday .
MOSCOW , February 26 ( RIA Novosti ) – Russia is planning to expand its permanent military presence outside its borders by placing military bases in a number of foreign countries , Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu said Wednesday .
Shoigu said the list includes Vietnam , Cuba , Venezuela , Nicaragua , the Seychelles , Singapore and several other countries .
“ The talks are under way , and we are close to signing the relevant documents , ” Shoigu told reporters in Moscow .
The minister added that the negotiations cover not only military bases but also visits to ports in such countries on favorable conditions as well as the opening of refueling sites for Russian strategic bombers on patrol .
Moscow currently has only one naval base outside the former Soviet Union – in Tartus , Syria , but the fate of this naval facility is uncertain because of the ongoing civil war in that country .
Post-Soviet Russia closed a large naval base in Vietnam and a radar base in Cuba in 2002 due to financial constraints .
However , Russia has started reviving its navy and strategic aviation since mid-2000s , seeing them as a tool to project the Russian image abroad and to protect its national interests around the globe .
Now , Moscow needs to place such military assets in strategically important regions of the world to make them work effectively toward the goal of expanding Russia 's global influence .

The latest AI devices ca n't just gauge your mood from what you say and how you say it , they can work out the best way to respond to cheer you up
Betsie Van Der Meer/Getty
“ BRIAN ? How are you , Brian ? ” The voice is coming from a screen dominated by a vast blue cartoon eyeball , its pupil dilating in a way that makes it look both friendly and quizzical . Think HAL reimagined by Pixar .
This is EmoSPARK , and it is looking for its owner . Its camera searches its field of view for a face and , settling on mine , asks again if I am Brian . It sounds almost plaintive .
EmoSPARK 's brain is a 90-millimetre Bluetooth and Wi-Fi-enabled cube . It senses its world through an internet connection , a microphone , a webcam and your smartphone . Using these , the cube can respond to commands to play any song in your digital library , make posts on Facebook and check for your friends ' latest updates , stream a Netflix film , answer questions by pulling information from Wikipedia , and simply make conversation .
Advertisement
EmoSpark
But its mission is more complex : EmoSPARK , say its creators , is dedicated to your happiness . To fulfil that , it tries to take your emotional pulse , adapting its personality to suit yours , seeking always to understand what makes you happy and unhappy .
The “ Brian ” in question is Brian Fitzpatrick , a founding investor in Emoshape , the company that makes EmoSPARK . They and the device 's inventor , Patrick Levy Rosenthal , compare EmoSPARK 's guiding principles to Isaac Asimov 's laws of robotics . They are billing the cube as the world 's first “ emotional AI ” .
But EmoSPARK is n't the first robotic agent designed to learn from our emotions . There 's Jibo the family robot and Pepper the robot companion . Even Amazon 's Echo voice-activated controller might soon be able to recognise emotions .
The drive to give artificial intelligence an emotional dimension is down to necessity , says Rana el Kaliouby , founder of Affectiva , a Boston-based company that creates emotion-sensing algorithms . As everything around us , from phones to fridges , gets connected to the internet , we need a way to temper machine logic with something more human .
And when the user is immersed in a world that is as much computer as real life , a machine must learn some etiquette . For example , you should n't come home from a funeral to find your AI itching to tell you about the latest Facebook cat videos .
“ We just ca n't help projecting emotions on to anything from dolphins to Microsoft 's paper clip ”
How can a machine be trained to understand emotions and act on them ? When EmoSPARK 's webcam finds my face , a red box flashes briefly on screen to indicate it has identified a face that is n't Brian 's . Behind the scenes , it is also looking for deeper details .
EmoSPARK senses the user 's emotional state with the help of an algorithm that maps 80 facial points to determine , among other things , whether they or they are smiling , frowning in anger or sneering in disgust . EmoSPARK also analyses the user 's tone of voice , a long-established method of mood analysis .
Having sensed these details , EmoSPARK uses them to mirror your emotions . First , it creates an emotional profile of its owner based on the combination of facial and voice input . At the end of each day , it sends this information to EmoShape , which sends back a newly tailored emotional profile for that particular device . Through this feedback loop , Fitzpatrick says , the cube 's personality changes ever so slightly every day .
Hard problems
Rosalind Picard at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology is sceptical that this can produce an accurate emotional profile . Picard , who designs facial and vocal analysis software to help computers interpret emotion , and co-founded Affectiva with el Kaliouby , says there 's more to understanding moods than mapping points on the face . “ What does it know about the context ? How much data is it trained on ? How is it being taught the true feelings of the person ? These are still hard problems to solve . ”
The algorithm used by EmoSPARK is n't necessarily all that sophisticated . Coaxing it to register a user 's smile requires a toothy grin in good lighting ; real-world conditions , for most people , do n't live up to that .
But maybe you do n't need a million-dollar algorithm . One aspect of creating “ emotional ” AI requires neither hardware nor software : it 's just a matter of exploiting what our brains do naturally . “ We anthropomorphise everything , ” says Eleanor Sandry at Curtin University in Perth , Australia . Humans project intent and emotions on to anything from dolphins to Microsoft 's paper clip . We ca n't help ourselves .
And EmoSPARK pulls out all the stops to put this tendency to work . To calibrate your cube , you undertake a ritual which ensures that only one person can be emotionally bound to it . “ Are you the person I am to bond with ? ” is its first question . Although it will recognise other individuals in the same house or building , it only creates the emotional profile for its owner .
That does n't mean it ca n't interact with anyone else . When someone who is not Brian taunts it , saying “ I do n't like you ” , EmoSPARK manifests its displeasure with a pulse of green light that shudders through the cube . “ It 's funny , I do n't like you that much either , ” it responds . If EmoSPARK had been complimented , it would have glowed purple .
Fitzpatrick says EmoSPARK can react to the user in more subtle ways , too , such as by withholding information or trivia that it regards as having displeased its owner previously . “ If you do n't like a joke it tells you , it wo n't tell you that joke again , ” they say .
Until EmoSPARK has spent some time in people 's homes , we wo n't know whether it can live up to its promise , or even whether having an AI trained on your emotional profile will make anyone feel happy . By now , however , 133 of EmoSPARK 's early crowdfunders have received their cubes and will act as beta testers . About 800 more should be available this month .
Whether EmoSPARK succeeds or fails , AI with EQ is something we can expect to see much more of , says el Kaliouby . They believe all devices will one day have emotion processors , much as they now contain a GPS chip . This means every device will have its own proprietary algorithm for interpreting users ' emotions , and will reflect them back at the user in slightly different ways . If your TV and your phone treat you a bit differently , that only adds to the illusion that you are surrounded by a sentient cast of characters , they say .
Two weeks ago , Affectiva released a mobile software development kit which will allow smartphone and tablet programmers to use its Affdex algorithm to assess emotions . Some prototype applications are already up and running .
Chocolate firm Hershey 's is using Affdex to determine whether people smile at a candy dispenser . If it detects a smile , the user gets a free chocolate sample .
Another is an art installation that reads the facial expressions of passers-by and composes messages in real time on a wall to cheer up the depressed and cheer on the happy . “ The idea that you can measure emotion and act on it ? ” says el Kaliouby . “ That 's happened . ”
Feelings can sway robot choices , too Artificial intelligence works when the programmer has a specific goal in mind , such as collision avoidance . But what about something more open-ended , such as foreseeing risk ? This requires the human capacity to make judgements . One approach is to equip the machines with emotions such as fear , curiosity or frustration , says Massimiliano Versace at Boston University . Such emotions are an important aspect of our intelligence and decision-making , but are different from the social emotions now in vogue in AIs ( see main story ) . These motivational emotions might be invisible to users of the AI , but more often than not , Versace says , the winning strategy “ is the one that feels better ” . They and their team have started working with NASA to design robot brains with emotional intelligence , to be used for exploring planetary surfaces .

One important aspect of RA anon 's documentation is the inclusion of an EEG report , in addition to the documentation of abuse descriptions made by a psychologist . The EEG is also shown here . The EEG documents both dissociative episodes/altered states and temporal lobe abnormality .
I begin this post with the effect , which is temporal lobe epilepsy in combination with Dissociative identity disorder , and end the post with the cause , which is severe trauma including electrocution of young children , as seen in the Podesta/Skippy/Fatherhood video , in a human version of a Skinner 's box .
My intent here in this post is to show that the above medical records , combined , are very strong for providing validation of ritual abuse , as well as the real physical evidence it leaves behind in terms of actual differences seen through the EEG , in brain activity .
The EEG showing temporal lobe issues combined with use of alters and statements of ritual abuse , together , are important for other survivors to see , in order to know deeply that they are not crazy , not making anything up , and that they are not alone .
There is a wealth of medical literature which has noted the involvement of temporal lobe epilepsy specifically in multiple personality disorder ( now called dissociative identity disorder ) . Although some medical professionals suggest that temporal lobe epilepsy can cause dissociation , I believe that the more likely explanation is that temporal lobe epilepsy is a physical , neurological symptom of dissociative identity disorder - a verifiable symptom , NOT a cause in and of itself . I believe that temporal lobe epilepsy may be caused in many cases ( when genetic factors are absent etc ) by traumatic events that are so severe as to cause personality fragmentation . RA Anon experienced abuse around birth/fetuses/ cannibalism , witnessed trafficking and abuse of others , and experienced electrocution similar to what is seen in the Skippy/Fatherhood video , as well as more ritualistic abuse and other varieties of trauma . I believe that the EEG of RA Anon confirms the real effects this trauma causes neurologically which coincides with multiple personality disorder and with the observations of RA anon 's childhood psychologist .
The partial documentation of ritual abuse follows :
It is important to note here that the alter name `` Laura '' has not been redacted , as it is not RA Anon 's real name . This documents the use of named alters at age 4 . The therapist states - `` [ RA Anon ] used 'Laura ' throughout the session and corrected the therapist when they used [ RA Anon 's given name ] . '' This is crucially important in documenting multiple personality disorder .
I provide documentation of the relationship between DID/MPD and temporal lobe issues . Many physicians view temporal lobe issues as either co-morbid with dissociation or even suggest that the seizures are the cause of personality fragmentation . I fundamentally disagree with this conclusion . I believe that severe trauma as found in MKULTRA type programs and ritual abuse , is the cause for BOTH dissociative identity disorder , and the resulting temporal lobe issues . I see the temporal lobe abnormalities documented in RA Anon 's medical record as a symptom of the real abuse they suffered and a validation of their MPD - not as a cause of the splitting , but a very real symptom of it .
Another study on this - `` Multiple personality and related dissociative phenomena in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy . ''
Forum post on dissociative identity disorder and temporal lobe epilepsy
Case study of a multiple personality disorder sufferer with Temporal lobe involvement :
Further , and possibly most alarming , when researching temporal lobe involvement with dissociative identity disorder , we find medical literature on the subject which cites none other than Lucis Trust and Madame Blovatski acolyte Alice Bailey .
The subject of Lucis Trust and its relationship to RA Anon through Findhorn , Psychosynthesis and Tavistock-linked Diana Whitmore was discussed in the RA anon series on Findhorn .
Given their occult , theosophical bent , their founding of `` Lucifer publishing company '' which was later renamed Lucis Trust , and their association with ritual abuse , it is extremely alarming and very telling that Alice Bailey and their channeling of a supposed Tibetan master would be used as evidence in modern medical literature . In my opinion this shows the direct connection between studies in mind control , ritual abuse , and the intentional effort to create multiple personality disorder by elite esoteric , military intelligence tied groups , including the UN-related Lucis Trust . This coincides with my previous writing on the real goal of institutions like the UN , which is to control the masses using a highly controlled , multiple personality suffering group of puppet elites .
Even if one does not agree with this conclusion , the evidence of an outright Madame Blavatsky acolyte occultists ' `` channeling '' being cited in medical literature on MULTIPLE PERSONALITY DISORDER of all things is extremely alarming and telling on how powerful Lucis Trust and the elites tied with Bailey are and were .
Can anyone imagine trying to have medical literature take the `` channeling '' of an occultist or `` psychic medium '' seriously , much less use it as evidence in the development of a `` scientific '' hypothesis ? On * Multiple Personality Disorder '' ? ? ?
The evidence exists , but it is in this Tavistock-Esalen-Findhorn-UN area of inquiry . < < This is the area where evidence very much lays in the open but very very few who are involved with `` pizzagate '' research have looked into this and MUCH MORE research MUST be done on this lead , for the sake of current , former , and future victims of this horrific monstrosity that is our currect power structure .
Bailey 's channeled Tibetan talks about what sounds like walk-ins ( where one soul supposedly takes over the body which has been vacated by the `` real '' soul ) - which is ironic considering that the author is performing a very similar supposed act of channeling .
This obsession with possession , walk-ins and similar rites explains and indicates the same globalist elite of which Blavatsky and Bailey were part , being OBSESSED with primitive and shamanic cultures . ( Not as an indictment against these cultures , however , their practices of dissociation via drugs , ritual , music , etc interested the elites greatly in terms of their own ritual abuse practice ) . One MUST understand and look into this area if they wish to understand modern ritual abuse . It is an extremely blatant but rarely explored lead , and because of that there is still a wealth of evidence stemming from it .
For example , as I recently discussed in my RA anon series on Esalen , Adam Crabtree , a major current figure there , * specializes in multiple personality disorder/dissociative identity disorder . * They also wrote a book comparing multiple personality to possession , which AGAIN shows the interest the elite have in shamanic and primitive rites which induce dissociation .
This is not the only example of elite fascination with the rituals of primitive groups ; they are particularly interested in cannibalism and cannablistic practice , and gravitate specifically towards those tribes and groups . A major example of this is the disappearance of Michael Rockefeller while they were 'studying ' a cannibalistic tribe in Papua New Guinea . Two documentaries were made on this disappearance , however , due to the revealing nature of the material , the documentaries are almost impossible to find . Even the DVD release of this film was delayed and possibly prevented .
I leave a documentary , an older one , which is available of youtube . NOTE : Not only are these people cannibalistic , they also believe in spirits , magic , etc . According to the documentary , Rockefeller `` went among them to study , and learn . ''

Hello again , Dropzoners , and welcome to the sixth article in our series breaking down the basics of Dropzone Commander !
Now that we���ve covered the game in broad strokes , we���re going to take a closer look at each of DZC���s five factions , breaking down how they play , their strengths and weaknesses , and contextualizing in terms of other games we���ve played in the past . If you���re looking to get into Dropzone , or are thinking about picking up a new faction but not sure which to grab , these are the articles for you .
For our final faction review , let���s cover the newest and most unusual of Dropzone Commander���s fighting forces ��� the rag-tag bands and iron-fisted warlords of the Resistance !
The Human Resistance
The Scourge invasion of human-occupied Earth and Cradle Worlds was an extinction-level event . Billions died in torrents of plasma-fire , and billions more were captured to become slave-hosts to the nightmarish parasites . But not all those left behind suffered the same fate . The pockets of free men and women rebuilt their lives in the shadow of destruction , forming new societies and raising up new leaders from the ashes to take the fight back to the invaders . When the UCM encounters these forces over 160 years later at the beginning of their Reconquest , they find what are essentially entirely new human cultures : disciplined bands of fighters carefully tending ancient military hardware ; creative survivors who have crafted strange patchwork weapons to turn the weapons of the enemy against them ; savage tribes of bloodthirsty maniacs who terrorize Scourge and humans alike . Collectively , the UCM designates these wildly-disparate groups ���the Resistance , ��� but the only thing all hold in common is the skill to survive and a burning hatred of their Scourge oppressors .
Visually , the Resistance pushes all the right buttons for me . Unlike other DZC forces ( which very successfully maintain a clear , consistent design aesthetic ) , the Resistance is a mashup of outdated military hardware that harkens back to Cold-War-era technology ( compare the Hannibal to a T-80 , a Zhukov to a Gepard AA gun , or a Cyclone to a HIND-D ) , alongside field-expedient civilian vehicles straight out of the Mad Max films . Though this might sound like a rather ugly combination ( and would be , in the hands of a lesser designer ) , Hawk has managed to pull this mix off beautifully , while also making the faction look and feel like an ancestor of the UCM . The little details like replacement armor plates , exposed engines , and individualized crewmen make them a painter 's dream or nightmare , depending on how fiddly you are !
Core Themes of the Resistance
Likewise , the Resistance is an army with two faces : the independent “ feral ” force , fielding piles of technicals , bombers flinging improvised munitions , and crazed berserkers under the command of brutal warlords ; and the other , more-friendly “ allied ” force which benefits from UCM military advisors and air power . This dual nature informs the Resistance at every level , making their armies a study in contrasts – primitive vehicles without even countermeasures fighting alongside tanks with an extravagance and sophistication no longer accepted in the modern era . The duality of Resistance forces is what sets them apart from all other DZC forces , and what makes them so much fun to play and paint .
Old Tech , New Tricks
As you might expect , two centuries of isolation means Resistance arsenals have incorporated civilian and older technology to make up for battlefield losses . Many of their core units , like technicals and wagons , lack countermeasures of any type ( as befits what are essentially private vehicles with rocket launchers and AA guns bolted on ! ) , which makes them vulnerable to all sorts of long-ranged abuse . Resistance fighters go to battle in up-armored “ battle buses ” or astride motorcycles , relying entirely on their driving skill and tactical prowess to stay alive . These shortcomings are rarely an issue when fighting the Resistance 's nemesis , the Scourge ( whose plasma weapons are short-ranged and immune to countermeasures ) , but are accentuated when fighting more traditional armies .
While this might paint a pretty grim picture for the Resistance on the tabletop , the truth is that they have found methods to exploit their unusual arsenal in new and interesting ways in play . For instance , the faction has no light or heavy drop-ships of their own , so instead employ hovercraft to provide countermeasures to their unprotected vehicles and to make lightning assaults unparalleled by more sophisticated forces . Rather than relying on aircraft for speedy extractions , they have re-purposed massive drills to burrow under and create safe passage to and from the battlefield for Resistance fighters and light vehicles . And one can not overlook the Leviathan and Thunderstorm Custom – titanic hovercraft ( literally wider than 6-lane highways in scale ) with immense transport capacity and festooned with guns…even overcharged plasma cannons from Scourge tanks ! The unusual tactics these sorts of innovations provide make the Resistance the trickiest of all factions to learn , short of the Shaltari…but when you are fighting superior opposition , fighting dirty is your best chance of winning !
They 've Got the Guns… .
True to form as a faction with two faces , the salvaged ( and very old ) military technology used by Resistance forces stands in sharp contrast to its makeshift line vehicles and bodged civilian tech . Contrary to what most of us would think of when we imagine 160-plus-year-old weapons , the tanks , APCs , jets , and helicopters available to the Resistance are actually of higher overall quality than their modern counterparts , having been built in a time when the peace and prosperity of humanity 's golden age allowed for extravagances , even during warfare . Hawk Wargames commonly describes this old military gear as “ over-armored and under-gunned ” – bristling with heavy armor and lots of weapons systems , but with power and range tending to be weaker than those of comparable modern counterparts . If you 're a historical buff , imagine the tanks made at the beginning of WW2 versus those built at war 's end and you 'll have a good sense of the differences in play .
As with their civilian tech , however , the Resistance turns these could-be weaknesses into unique strengths . Though terribly out of fashion for orbital-strike forces , the Cyclone helicopter gunship is arguably the best in the game , rocking heavy armor , 2 anti-tank missile systems , and a powerful indirect-firing barrage missile system , all on a mobile frame . The Warthog Hellhog ground attack jet can shred whole formations with its appropriately-named Satan chaingun , and act like a gunship or fast mover at will . And the Lifthawk assault drop-ship ( in my humble opinion ) is the finest drop-ship available , thanks to its great durability , powerful weaponry ( very heavy machine guns , missiles , and optional 360掳 AA gun ) and ability to carry any number of Resistance APCs and tanks .
And speaking of tanks…they are good enough that they deserve their own paragraph . Even the lightest Resistance tank is at least as tough as the heaviest UCM model , and rocks two separate cannons , making them all a serious threat to structures and numerically-superior opponents . The Zhukov AA tank replaces its main cannon with a hyper-accurate and long-range anti-aircraft railgun capable of downing anything short of a heavy drop-ship in a single shot . At the top of the pyramid is the super heavy Alexander command tank , which ( aside from having an excellent and sagacious name ) can lay down fire that can level buildings or entire battlegroups with equal impunity . Only the foolish and the dead underestimate the firepower a committed Resistance force can bring to bear , even if it is a bit less powerful than others ' .
…And They 've Got the Numbers
Backing up these elite military relics and civilian conversions are the heart of the Resistance : the infantry . Prior to the most recent waves of releases for DZC , the Resistance was the faction with the most infantry choices in the game , from frothing Berserkers to resolute Occupation Veterans to speedy Freerider bikers . They can be taken in small units and mounted in APCs aboard a Lifthawk for searching a broader area ; packed into battle buses to drown CQBs with the weight of raw numbers ; and mix up Troops and Exotics within the same battlegroup ( or even the same drop-ship or hovercraft ) . This flexibility combined with the excellent morale and low points cost of basic Fighters makes the Resistance DZC ‘ s de facto “ infantry army ” – a distinction it���s unlikely to lose anytime soon .
Looking beyond raw manpower , the low costs of many core Resistance units also makes it possible to field the closest thing Dropzone Commander has to a “ horde ” army . Both types of technical are just 10 points following the most recent errata , and up to 24 can be jammed into a single Leviathan hovercraft for right around 300 points . If tiny cars with missile launchers are n't your speed , the reliable flak-spewing Gun Wagon , building-clearing Flame Wagon , and the artillery-churning Storm Wagon can be had for a maximum of 25 points , giving you the opportunity to saturate the table with AA fire or barrages easily alongside more elite units .
The Resistance in Warhammer 40,000 Terms
Hordes of infantry and ramshackle vehicles backed up by tough-but-rare elite units sounds a lot like Warhammer 40,000 ‘ s infamous Orks . While the Resistance does n't have the same irreverent streak that the greenskins do , their tactical doctrines are quite a bit alike ( especially ferals ) : spread out , absorb your losses , and smash their faces in ! Units like the Barrel Bomber���a drop-ship loaded with truck-sized bombs rather than transports ���or characters like the chainsaw-wielding maniac , Gunnar the Ferryman , scream “ Orkish delight. ” If you 're a fan of the fungal horde , you 've got a home in DZC .
The Resistance in Warmachine Terms
The sub-factionalized nature of the Resistance reminds us a lot of Warmachine ‘ s Mercenaries . Like the Mercs , Resistance armies field previous-generation heavy armor alongside diverse and unconventional infantry to great effect , and are often limited in how many of any one unit they can take ( namely by the Rare unit rule ) . And , like Mercs , owning the Resistance is like owning two forces in one : the sub-faction you choose fundamentally changes which units you can field and how your army plays ( since you also use a different command deck , specialized units , and special characters ) .
The Commenters��� Opinions
Dropzone Commenter :
For me , the Resistance was love at first sight . I am a died-in-the-wool Scourge player , and had long planned on picking up PHR as a second force just for something completely different to paint and play . Then I saw it : a starter box loaded with trucks straight out of the Road Warrior…Soviet-meets-Art-Deco tanks and drop-ships…helicopters ! And they were the perfect opposing force for my Scourge when teaching friends to play the game ? It 's like the stars aligned ; we were meant to be together . I 've only had a few chances to play my Resistance thus far ( I 'm forcing myself to completely finish painting my Scourge to avoid gamer ADD ) , but what I 've seen I���ve really liked . The force has a tremendous diversity in its unit choices , and���as befits an army entering the game well after its original launch���there are no units that are clearly “ filler ” or outmoded by others . Currently I 'm running a “ makeshift military ” allied force with lots of Cyclones , tanks , and APCs backed up by Archangel Pathfinders and Marine Force Recon themed partially around the show Falling Skies , but I also look forward to grabbing some Barrel Bombers and running a Road Warrior-inspired list of crazed feuding warlords featuring Gunnar the Ferryman in their fire-spewing drop-ship of doom ! The possibilities really are endless…once I get my Scourge done , at least .
DZ Casualty :
I���ve played against Resistance once with Scourge , and at the time , battlefield circumstances demanded that I use���unconventional tactics in order to compensate for less than optimal attrition rates . In short , Resistance had the upper hand for most of the game . It was difficult to take out the Lifthawks , due to their high DP . Commenter���s Resistance used combined arms ( Tanks , Cyclones , Technicals and Freeriders ) to quickly eliminate my anti-air units , and then those damn Cyclones loitered over ( translate : shat upon ) my ground forces and were able to cherry pick targets at leisure . Resistance seemed to have good mobility , surprisingly strong air power , and a very diverse variety of ground units . It���s a very different force than the initial four factions and offers players a unique approach to the game .
Fight the Power !
The Resistance brings a lot to the Dropzone Commander universe ��� a look into the lives of civilians before the invasion , creative and great-looking new models , and a great ���multi-faction��� that supports a wide range of playstyles and army builds . Whether you want to play an elite army with tough , versatile military units , a post-apocalyptic horde of maxed-out madmen , or a force that simply looks fantastic all painted up on the table , chances are the Resistance is right for you !
Whew ! That completes our review of the DZC factions ! Next up , we���re going to talk nuts and bolts ��� how to get into the game and build an army that���s fun with a starter set and about $ 100 . See you in a week , Commanders !

Route 20 road trip in Upstate NY
Nairobi National Park , Kenya ( CNN ) Twelve ivory towers burned in Kenya on Saturday , sending thick plumes of ash and smoke over Nairobi National Park as elephant and rhino tusks smoldered .
A rainy Saturday afternoon brought together heads of state from several African nations and hundreds of onlookers to watch Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta set fire to over $ 172 million worth of illicit wildlife goods .
A somber mood took over the crowd as the event began . They listened to the gust of wind feeding the flames , and the crackle of burning ivory , rhino horn and other items . Bright red embers bloomed inside the 10-foot high by 20-foot wide pyres , turning the coveted white ivory tusks to nothing more than charred animal remains .
This was the most significant demonstration against poaching in the region and the largest burn of illegal wildlife products in history .

The pyre is one of around a dozen that was burned in Nairobi National Park , Kenya on Saturday , April 30 , 2016 in a dramatic statement against illegal poaching . Hide Caption 1 of 8 Photos : The mass burning involved 105 tons of elephant ivory and more than 1 ton of rhino horn , believed to be the largest stockpile ever destroyed .

Over its life , a live elephant generates 76 times more in tourism revenue than it does for its ivory , according to the David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust , an elephant rescue and rehabilitation group .

`` The rising value of elephant ivory trade , illegally on the international market , has resulted in a massacre in the rainforest of Africa , '' Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta told the crowd . `` In 10 years in central Africa we have lost as many as 70 % of the elephants . The elephant , as has been said , is an iconic symbol of our country . Unless we take action now we risk losing this magnificent animal . ''
It took Kenya 's Wildlife Services 10 days to build the crematorium that contained the 105 tons of elephant ivory , 1.35 tons of rhino horn , exotic animal skins and other products such as sandalwood and medicinal bark . This was Kenya 's fourth such burn in a practice that goes back to 1989 -- an idea hatched to combat the worsening poaching crisis .
Priceless and worthless at the same time

The tusks alone -- from about 8,000 elephants -- would be worth more than $ 105 million on the black market , according to wildlife trade expert Esmond Bradley Martin . The rhino horn , from 343 animals , would be worth more than $ 67 million .
That 's one and a half times more than Kenya spends on its environmental and natural resources agency every year .
But the Kenyans say that the stockpile is not valuable -- it 's worthless .
`` From a Kenyan perspective , we 're not watching any money go up in smoke , '' Kenya Wildlife Service Director General Kitili Mbathi said . `` The only value of the ivory is tusks on a live elephant . ''
Mbathi , who oversaw the burn , explained how a fuel pumping system that combined kerosene and diesel had been built to aid the combustion of the pyres , which would take about a week to completely burn .

Critics of the burn worry the destruction of this stockpile will increase the price of ivory in the black market and encourage more poaching .
`` That is an ignorant idea , '' renowned conservationist Richard Leakey told the crowd at the burn ceremony . `` We did it before and prices went from $ 300 down to $ 5 within three months of that fire . It is quite shameful the slaughter of these wild species in a world that seems hell bent on destroying itself anyway -- let 's give our support to nature and the endangered species . ''

`` Today 's event allows Kenya to send a very public message to the international community and here in Kenya , that it does not tolerate and it will not tolerate the illegal trade in wildlife , '' John Scanlon , spokesperson for the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species ( CITES ) , told the crowd .
`` Not only it has a devastating impact on the animal themselves and their ecosystem but it has an impact on security , on livelihoods and on economy , '' said Scanlon .
Kenya 's tourism , based mostly around its wildlife , makes up about 12 % of the country 's GDP . Over its life , a live elephant generates 76 times more in tourism revenue than it does for its ivory , according to the David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust , an elephant rescue and rehabilitation group .
Back at Nairobi National Park , the clouds of smoke have turned the sky a fetid gray shade of green . Organizers hope this image , and stigma , will be burned into memory forever .
BATHINDA : They are a peoples ' hero in India , but there is also no dearth of aficionados of Bhagat Singh even in Pakistan where religious groups rule the roost and try not to allow such activities devoted to martyrs.Many residents of Lahore on Sunday paid tributes to Bhagat Singh at Shadman Chowk , a roundabout where once stood Lahore Central Jail . Bhagat Singh along with their comrades Rajguru and Sukhdev was hanged there on March 23 , 1931.The activists of the civil society and theatre groups have been paying tributes to the martyr for the last many years despite threats . They have also been demanding renaming the roundabout as Bhagat Singh Chowk . `` Bhagat Singh aficionadas in Pakistan are seeking renaming of Shadman Chowk in Lahore for the last many years , but the provincial government is shying away from doing so despite the evacuee trust authorities ' assurances to look into their demand , '' said a social activist and director of the Institute for Peace And Secular Studies ( IPSS ) Diep Saeeda . `` The IPSS , theatre groups and human rights activists on Sunday assembled at the roundabout and raised the issue again after paying floral tributes to the martyr , '' said Saeeda while talking to The Times of India over phone from Lahore . `` It is disturbing that the government has named roads after British viceroys and even heads of the states of other countries , but refused to name a road/roundabout after the martyr who had studied at Lahore and worked for equality . `` She added , `` We are also demanding that Bradley Hall , regularly frequented by Bhagat Singh during their student days , too should be converted into a museum named after him . `` Last year the religious group Jamaat-ud-Dawa ( JuD ) had threatened the activists not to observe the martyrdom day and had even assaulted activists , including women.Saeeda said Jamaat-ud-Dawa had also issued threats through newspapers that whoever will seek renaming of Shadman Chowk will be considered a traitor , anti-nationalist and anti-Islam . `` The group had even attacked peaceful participants and assaulted women , '' they added.In November 2012 civil society activists Taimur Rehman and Diep Saeeda had filed two applications in the Lahore high court for renaming the chowk .
TEMPO.CO , Jakarta - Minister of Youth and Sports ( Menpora ) Imam Nahrawi finally took decisive steps to freeze the Football Association of Indonesia ( PSSI ) . The decision was taken after three warning letters sent were not taken seriously by the PSSI .
`` Its foundation is strong , SP1 ( first warning letter ) , SP2 , and SP3 . The suspension is for all sports activities carried out by PSSI , '' said Deputy V Field Harmonization of the Youth and Sports Ministry , Gatot S. Dewa Broto , when contacted on Saturday , April 18th , 2015 .
In a decree signed by Minister Imam Nahrawi , April 17 , 2015 , described that until the deadline specified in the warning letter of I , II , and III , PSSI obviously proven ignored and did not comply with government policy . Based on that , the Youth and Sports Minister provides administrative sanctions by not recognizing all sports activities carried PSSI . The decision applied since the letter was assigned .
`` Later on , the minister will make a transition team , '' said Gatot .
Regarding the transition , in the decree , the government will form a team to take over the rights and authority of the PSSI until the formation of a competent management is in accordance with organizational mechanisms and FIFA statutes . This team is responsible and obligated to submit reports to the Minister of Youth .
Regarding the preparations for the 2015 SEA Games in Singapore , the national football team will have to keep on going . The government , together with KONI and KOI , agreed that the two institutions together with the Indonesia Gold Program ( PRIMA ) will run the team preparation .
While all matches of the Indonesian Super League ( ISL ) in 2015 , such as of the Main Division , Division I , II , and III will be carried out as usual with KONI supervision and KOI , together with Asprov PSSI and local clubs .

Ernest Hemingway was a cat-lover . They admired their spirit and independence , and often wrote about them . Hemingway was given a special six toed cats from a ship 's captain , and from that cat the legends of Hemingway 's cats have grown . This cat , which may have been a Maine Coon , had extra toes ( technically known as polydactyl , latin for `` many digits '' ) . Today , approximately 60 cats , half of them polydactyl , make their home in the Ernest Hemingway Museum and Home , in Key West , protected and taken care of by the terms of theirs will . The many cats now living in and around the Hemingway House are descendents of Hemingway 's first cat , and are given fanciful names , as they once did , after movie stars and even characters in their books . These cats are so popular and so well-known , that the nickname `` Hemingway Cats '' has often been given to describe polydactyls . While I was visiting Hemingway 's house , the cats were wandering throughout the house and grounds . They are taken care of by the staff and a full time vet . They are very used to the tourists and pretty much ignored us , prefering to just cat nap where ever they found a cool quiet spot to sleep .

`` After [ the late trade unionist ] Helen Kelly 's medicinal cannabis campaign and other moves to move towards a more regulated market model in places like Colorado and Hawaii and some of the states in Canada ... it does seem that the public mood has shifted .
`` So we thought well maybe it is time to put that to the test , '' Mr Shaw said .
Ms Kelly , the former Council of Trade Unions leader , was diagnosed with lung cancer and their attempts to manage led to their battle to get medical cannabis legalised .
Mr Shaw said another part of the Greens ' deal with Labour is addressing the gender pay gap in the public service .
`` It is time that we deal with it , it is 2017 and actually the gap in the public sector is often worse than it is in the private sector . ''
Mr Shaw said in some government departments men earn up to 20 percent more than women in the same roles .
The email said there would also be `` significant climate action , with a shift towards a net zero carbon emissions economy by 2050 '' .
An independent climate commission will be established and there would be support for a shift in farming to more sustainable land use .
Introduction
Microsoft officially announced Windows 10 last September but it took until the end of last month to get more details about it and finally get to try it . Number 9 was skipped and Microsoft is wanting us to believe that it 's because an upgrade of such magnitude deserves a notable digit . We now have a unified platform that runs on phones , slates , and PCs , or so the PR materials go .
Actually things are a bit more complicated with Microsoft offering one version of Windows 10 for large devices ( 8+ inch screens ) and another one for small devices ( phones and small tablets ) . Chances are things will get even more complicated if ARM-based large slates are to arrive in the future , but that 's beyond the point here .
What Microsoft has done is tailor the experience to the size class so you wo n't get a classic desktop with tiny icons on your small phone , and you wo n't have to waste any space when you get the more accurate mouse and keyboard combo at hand . The unification consists in many shared interfaces that should , will make you feel at home as you switch between form factors .
More importantly , much of the code inside the OS is shared across form factors and devices , which will allow developers to create apps that work everywhere , even on an Xbox . Microsoft itself led the way creating a unified People app working across all Windows 10 devices , shared Outlook app plus the mandatory Office package .
Windows 10 Technical Preview for Desktop was already released a while back , but we finally got to see Windows 10 Technical Preview for Phones . And you bet we were eager to get a glimpse of what 's coming and we 've downloaded it immediately .
The Preview for Phones is currently available for Lumia 630 , Lumia 635 , Lumia 636 , Lumia 638 , Lumia 730 and Lumia 830 . It will later be seeded to Insider program member with Lumia 1520 , Lumia 930 and Lumia 1020 . Microsoft has promised that by the time Windows 10 is ready for primetime , it will be compatible with all Windows 8-based Lumia smartphones , even if those with limited processing power might miss on some of the new features .
According to Sixers head coach Brett Brown , Joel Embiid has experienced soreness in their right foot , which prompted the team to put them back in a walking boot .
`` He is , '' Brown said when asked whether Embiid was in a boot . `` There was some soreness . It 's far more of a precautionary thing . ''
According to Brown , the decision to put a boot back on Embiid 's recovering right foot was made on Saturday night .
`` It is a minor thing . It 's so precautionary , '' Brown said . `` When they said ' I feel a little soreness ' , our first reaction is to go back to square one and go back to the boot . ''
`` When you speak to doctors and people that do this all the time , they say it 's quite normal , '' Brown continued . `` It 's part of the recovery of an injury that you will experience some soreness from time to time . ''
Brown did confirm that Embiid is in California , along with head athletic trainer Kevin Johnson , for a regularly scheduled checkup , and not as a reaction to the soreness .
`` He gets excited to be on a court , and they were proud of their growth , coming back to where they were doing a little bit more and more , '' Brown said about Embiid being overly ambitious at times . `` We have to tame him , calm them down , because they just wants to be on the court . He 's dying to play basketball .
`` Sometimes when we turn our heads he 'll go out there and take a shot or do that dunk , '' Brown continued . `` But they get it . They have been responsible with most of it . We just have to make sure that we continue to help put them in environments that will allow them to maximize their health .
`` When they did experience some minor pain they brought it to our attention and we just wanted to stay on top of it , '' Brown concluded .
Want the 50Mbps speeds that Verizon 's FiOS service can provide , but do n't want to spend $ 144.95 ( one-year contract ) or $ 164.95 ( month-to-month ) that Verizon charges in most markets ? Earlier this month , an ISP in California called DSL Extreme announced that it would offer 50Mbps fiber access for $ 99.95 a month across 17 states . What the company did not say in the release , but later confirmed to us , is that DSL Extreme is one of the first wholesalers of FiOS Internet service .
While federal `` line-sharing '' requirements in the US died some years ago , telcos still voluntarily sell all sorts of wholesale services to smaller ISPs , mostly in the form of last-mile DSL links . Such offerings can make it difficult to be price competitive with the telco 's own Internet service , but DSL Extreme is one of the largest wholesale partners for both AT & T and Verizon , so it can leverage its scale to get a better deal . I spoke with George Mitsopoulos , the VP and general manager of the company , who said that DSL Extreme is large enough that it actually offers wholesale Internet connections of its own to hundreds of small ISPs across the country , in addition to selling its own services .
That scale means that DSL Extreme does intend to compete with Verizon on the price of fiber for its new `` Fiber Extreme '' product . Its initial offerings , including 10Mbps links for $ 39.95 and 50Mbps connections for $ 99.95—are priced at the dreaded `` introductory rate , '' but Mitsopoulos tells me that the rate is good for one year and will only increase by five bucks when it comes time to renew .
Compared to Verizon 's own rates , the prices are a good deal , but DSL Extreme ca n't offer access to Verizon 's TV or VoIP services . Customers who want those features can still get them , but this requires a second bill directly from Verizon .
And when it comes to price , Verizon is perfectly capable of lowering its own prices , too . It has already done so in some markets , offering 50Mbps fiber connections for $ 90 in places like New York and Virginia .
That 's why DSL Extreme also wants to compete on customer service , and on services ( it offers Exchange hosted e-mail , for instance , support for Outlook , SharePoint , and the Blackberry , and Google Apps support ) . The company 's call centers and support operations are all based in the US , with the main call center in Los Angeles—a fact the company trumpets proudly on its website and that Mitsopoulos tells me is an excellent sales tool .
With the death of line-sharing rules , reselling Internet service has been largely a niche business when set against the size of the telcos and cable companies . Still , if reselling wholesale FiOS can be a viable business , more power to ISPs like DSL Extreme . They have a chance to differentiate themselves on good customer service , unique features , and ( for the moment ) price . In today 's economy , that sounds like a better proposition than ever .
In what seems to be an announcement lost within the buzz of iOS 7 and OS X Mavericks ( amongst other WWDC news ) , Apple will finally open up the iOS SDK to fully support hardware game controllers , enabling handheld-esque gaming experiences akin to the Nintendo 3DS and Playstation Vita on the iPhone , iPad , and iPod touch .
As with background apps downloads and new Directions APIs , Apple announced hardware controller support during Monday 's keynote address in one of those ‘ things we added but did n't have time to talk about ' slides ( pictured above ) . The slide indicates that the iOS 7 SDK will support ‘ MFi game controllers , ' which is a reference to Apple 's licensing program for third-party hardware accessories . Additionally , Touch Arcade points us to images from Apple 's iOS 7 Developer Guide showing a graphic of two controllers , strikingly similar to the Nintendo 3DS and Wii Classic Controller ( from left to right ) , showing new methods of interacting with iOS via hardware buttons and joysticks . Moreover , we ca n't help but notice that this announcement comes right off the heals of Tim Cook 's pledge at D11 to be ‘ more open ' than before .
There are also a few other enhancements for gamers coming in iOS 7….Here 's how Apple explains the new Game Controller framework :
The new Game Controller framework , added in iOS 7 and OS X v10.9 , makes it easy to find controllers connected to a Mac or iOS device . Once discovered , your game reads control inputs as part of its normal gameplay . There are three kinds of controllers available :
-A standard form-fitting controller : An iOS device sits inside the controller and the player can access both the iOS device 's screen and the controller elements . -An extended form-fitting controller : An iOS device sits inside the controller and the player can access both the iOS device 's screen and the controller elements . -An extended wireless controller : A controller that wirelessly connects to an iOS device or Mac .
-Controllers Must Be Optional -Controllers Are Automatically Connected Once Discovered -Profiles Map Hardware Controls to Software Needs -Snapshots Record Controller Data
A few other things Apple announced is coming in iOS 7 but did n't show off in detail : Secure game scores , Authenticated Game Center players , new turn-based game modes , and ranking-style leaderboards .
While existing hardware and software controller solutions currently exist , such as Joypad and the iCade respectively , none have yet been able to seamlessly integrate themselves directly into the operating system in order to facilitate smooth , reliable gameplay . Up until this point , third party developers have had to custom code software to specifically enable support for add-on hardware in specific apps . With each yearly iOS release , changes to the operating system 's SDK often broke existing parts of developers ' configurations , forcing some to rewrite their code each year and others to abandon the concept and integration entirely .
Fortunately , with iOS 7 , Apple will be able to provide a consistent graphical interface and under-the-hood standard for developers to match and configure per their use-case . Such integration directly into the OS will allow for controllers to take advantage of some of the first party perks bluetooth keyboards now feature today , such as button/key mapping and volume controls . Perhaps with new additions to the iOS 7 SDK like inter-app audio and new Multitasking APIs , new game controllers will allow users to trigger multitasking and perhaps even iTunes Radio right from the controller without having to jump into different apps . These new additions will certainly make users of existing controller solutions extremely happy and may even foster a new wave of popularity for these accessories .
It 's even possible that Apple has a bigger plan for controller support than just handheld gaming . While we 're only speculating , one could easily assume that Apple may have plans to integrate controller support with Apple TV via AirPlay and bluetooth , to enable console-like gaming on the big screen . Could this just be the beginning of Apple 's foray into the home gaming console market ? With new product categories on the horizon , anything 's possible .
As they have each year since the brutal 1999 murder of Billy Jack Gaither , gay rights groups from across Alabama will gather in Montgomery on Sunday to push for an end to violence against gays and lesbians .
Gaither , a 39-year-old Sylacauga man , was stabbed , their throat was cut , they were beaten with an ax handle and their body burned on a pile of tires on Feb. 19 , 1999 , because they were gay . Two men were sentenced to life in prison for the murder .
Sunday 's vigil , being held at 4 p.m. on the steps of the state capitol , is intended to urge lawmakers to pass a proposed expansion of Alabama 's hate crime law , organizers said .
Alabama 's current hate crimes law sets mandatory minimum sentences for crimes motivated by race , color , religion , national origin , ethnicity or physical or mental disability , but does not address sexual orientation or gender identity . Gay rights advocates say that must change .
According to FBI statistics , 19 percent of hate crime victims nationwide in 2010 were targeted because of sexual orientation , making gays and lesbians the third most targeted group for hate crimes .
`` Violence in Alabama is real . Just look what happened to Billy Jack Gaither . We 've got to stop blaming victims and see gay bashing for what it is -- a willful act of violence . There 's a glaring hole in Alabama 's hate crime law and we 've got to close it , '' Ralph Young , Equality Alabama 's vicechairperson , said in a news statement .
State Rep. Patricia Todd , D-Birmingham , the state 's first openly lesbian legislator , has introduced a bill to expand the state 's hate crime law , but as of Friday no action had been taken on the bill , according to legislative records . The fight for that expansion of the hate crimes law has been going on for 15 years but has had no success , said George Olsson , an advocate for gays and lesbians who helped organize the first vigil a month after Gaither 's murder .
`` It 's not getting anywhere , but we keep trying , '' Olsson said .
Olsson recalled that in the 1990s one legislator said `` he could n't vote for it because they were afraid their constituents would think they were gay . ''
Todd and Southern Poverty Law Center LGBT rights attorney Sam Wolfe will speak at Sunday 's event .
Also at the event , James Robinson will receive the Billy Jack Gaither Humanitarian Award in recognition of the work they have done on behalf of young gays and lesbians in Huntsville .
Hoover High School student Sara Couvillon will receive the Stephen Light Youth Activism Award . That award is named in honor of a gay rights activist who died in June at age 25 , Young said .
Couvillon was told by Hoover school officials in August that they could not attend school wearing a T-shirt that read `` gay ? fine by me . '' The school quickly reversed that decision after facing legal pressure by the SPLC .
The event is co-sponsored by the Alabama NOW , Equality Alabama , Immanuel Presbyterian Church in Montgomery , New Hope Metropolitan Community Church , the Montgomerybased Parents , Friends , and Families of Lesbians and Gays , the Alabama Safe Schools Coalition , the Unitarian Universalist Fellowship of Montgomery , and the SPLC .
The hackers who leaked unaired episodes of HBO 's shows , including 'Game of Thrones ' , earlier this week have now threatened to release additional content on Sunday .
The hacker group wrote in an automated email reply sent to Variety.com , that it will release the leak gradually every week and added that the next release may come this Sunday at 12 GMT ( 5 p.m. IST ) .
The group also repeated its claim that it had obtained a total of 1.5TB of data when it broke into HBO 's computer networks , Variety.com reported on Friday .
Russian cybersecurity firm Kaspersky Lab termed the incident a new phenomenon as far as cyber crimes go .
`` The HBO attack was relatively a new phenomenon . At first and throughout the 90s and early 2000s , most hackers intended primarily on vandalism attacks rather than for making money . But with time , it became clear that cyberattacks could bring with them serious money , '' Altaf Halde , MD , Kaspersky Lab , told IANS .

`` The value of such a cyber hack is entirely dependent on how much attention it can bring . Hacking into HBO and stealing 'Game of Thrones ' piggybacks on one of the most active talking points in the world . Entertainment companies are like governments and hacking groups in that their intellectual property is of interest to everyone , '' Halde added .
There were fears among HBO 's employees of their personal data having been accessed by the hackers , but the company denied the notion .
`` At this time , we do not believe that our email system as a whole has been compromised , but the forensic review is ongoing , '' Richard Plepler , President and CEO , HBO , said earlier this week .
However , according to Variety.com , a security contractor hired by HBO to scrub search results for the leaked data from Google revealed in a filing on Tuesday that the hackers got their hands on `` thousands of internal documents '' .
The hacker group on Monday had leaked 1.5TB of HBO 's data including the script of the next episode of 'Game of Thrones ' and unreleased episodes of 'Ballers ' and 'Room 104 ' -- two of HBO 's other shows , after which the TV network started an investigation in the matter .
Trivia answer ? Sure , but this Red 's part in Cub title not trivial
CINCINNATI — On Saturday , for the first time since the trade that became legendary in Chicago , Reds right-hander Scott Feldman got to see in person the guy who forever made them the answer to a Cubs trivia question .
“ I was joking with the guys the other day , calling it the ‘ Scott Feldman trade , ' not the ‘ Jake Arrieta trade , ' `` Feldman said . “ He 's pretty tough . Sometimes a change of scenery can really help somebody out , I guess . Look at them now : He 's one of the top pitchers in the league . ”
In 2013 , Feldman became the definition of one of the trademarks of the rebuilding plan under Theo Epstein : the sign-and-flip starter .
The Cubs used them to pull off the most lopsided trade in the last decade .
Remember this guy ? The `` Scott Feldman trade '' that landed Jake Arrieta for the Cubs might be baseball 's most lopsided trade of the last decade .
A one-year free agent coming off a down year , Feldman got off to a strong start with a bad Cubs team , and they were sent to Baltimore in July with backup catcher Steve Clevenger for Arrieta and reliever Pedro Strop .
Arrieta since then : 57-21 with a 2.57 ERA in 102 starts , an All-Star selection , a 2015 Cy Young Award and a 2016 World Series ring .
“ I do n't think we 're competitive in '15 without him , and we 're not a playoff team without him , ” Epstein said recently . “ Maybe the whole timetable for the rebuild is different without him . ”
Said Feldman : “ Kind of funny how that works out . Maybe Theo should send me over a ring . . . . Just kidding . ”
The time with the Cubs worked out for Feldman , too . They used the season as a springboard to a three-year , $ 30 million deal with the Astros , eventually being traded to the Blue Jays for their playoff push last year .
They signed a one-year , $ 2.3 million deal with the Reds for this year . In fact , they were their Opening Day starter —something Arrieta was not for their team this year .
Feldman , 34 , who actually has made three opening starts for three teams , does n't spend a lot of time thinking about their place in Cubs lore .
“ I just think about how much I enjoyed being over there and playing with those guys , ” said Feldman , who especially appreciated pitching coach Chris Bosio , Anthony Rizzo and strength coach Tim Buss .
“ I was happy for them to take it all the way . It must 've been a pretty cool celebration . ”
Whether they take a little private pride in their part of the bigger picture of that historic championship , Feldman would welcome a chance to return at some point in their career .
“ Who would n't want to play [ there ] , '' Feldman said . ‘ ‘ They 're set up to be good for a long time . And I think that 's what a lot of teams are modeling their formulas after , the way Theo rebuilt the Cubs .
“ Chicago 's a great spot to live , a great spot to play . It was fun being on that team even when we were n't very good . It was just a cool place to play , walk to the ballpark and see everybody with their Cubs shirts on , drinking beers at 9 in the morning . It was pretty cool . ”
And if their Cubs experience goes full circle ?
“ You never know , ” they said . “ It 'd be pretty cool . ”
NOTES : Reds shortstop Zack Cozart was scratched because of a sore wrist .
† Ben Zobrist returned to the lineup after being sidelined much of the week with a sore lower back . They singled , doubled and scored twice .

Jason Reed / Reuters President Barack Obama stops mid-stride to greet supporters during a campaign rally at George Mason University in Fairfax , Va. , Oct. 19 , 2012 .
President Barack Obama has been hitting GOP nominee Mitt Romney for weeks over what they say is Romney 's shifting to more moderate general-election policies , but now they have a new catchphrase for it : `` Romnesia . ''
Speaking at George Mason University in Fairfax , Va. , Obama turned the joke into a four-minute soliloquy , laying out what they said were all of Romney 's inconsistent positions .
“ He 's changing up so much -- backtracking and sidestepping . We 've got to name this condition that he 's going through . I think ... I think it 's called 'Romnesia , ' '' they said as the crowd of 9,000 erupted into cheers and applause . “ Now , I 'm not a medical doctor but I do want to go over some of the symptoms with you . Because I want to make sure nobody else catches it . ”
Given that the event was geared towards female voters -- signs at the front of the stage read “ Women 's Health Security ” and even the invocation was centered around women 's issues -- Obama first mentioned what they said were Romney 's evolving statements on workplace fairness and women 's health .
President Barack Obama speaks at George Mason University in Fairfax , Va. , telling supporters that Governor Mitt Romney 's plan will squeeze the middle class .
“ If you say you 're for equal pay for equal work , but you keep refusing to say whether or not you 'd sign a bill that protects equal pay for equal work , you might have Romnesia , ” they said as the crowd laughed . “ If you say women should have access to contraceptive care , but you supported legislation that would let your employers deny you contraceptive care , you might have a case of Romnesia . ”
They concluded by joking that their health care plan would be able to cure anyone suffering from what ails Romney .
“ And if you come down with a case of Romnesia , and you ca n't seem to remember the policies that are still on your website or the promises you 've made over the six years you 've been running for president , here 's the good news . 'Obamacare ' covers preexisting conditions ! We can fix you up ! We 've got a cure ! ” they exclaimed as the audience reached a fever pitch .
Before launching into their new attack line , Obama also renewed their criticism over Romney 's economic plan , again calling it a “ sketchy deal ” and noting that New York Times columnist Paul Krugman called it a “ snow job on the American people . ”
But most of Obama 's critiques for Romney pertained specifically to women 's issues , which emerged as one of the hottest topics in Tuesday 's presidential debate .
They warned that the next president would potentially have the ability to appoint a new Supreme Court justice , raising the prospect of revisiting the landmark Roe v. Wade decision regarding abortion rights .

Obama also alluded to Romney 's “ binders full of women ” comment during the debate .
“ When the next president and Congress would tip the balance of the highest court in the land in a way that turns back the clock for women and families for decades to come , you do n't want someone who needs to ask for binders of women . You do n't want that guy , '' they said .
Virginia Delegate Barbara Comstock responded to the president 's remarks on behalf of the Romney campaign , saying in a statement : `` Women have n't forgotten how we 've suffered over the last four years in the Obama economy with higher taxes , higher unemployment , and record levels of poverty . President Obama has failed to put forward a second-term agenda -- and when you do n't have a plan to run on , you stoop to scare tactics . ''
The president returned to the White House after their remarks , from which he 'll depart later on Friday for Camp David , the presidential retreat in Maryland , where he 'll prepare for next Monday 's presidential debate .

LONDON/PANAMA CITY ( Reuters ) - Governments across the world began investigating possible financial wrongdoing by the rich and powerful on Monday after a leak of four decades of documents from a Panamanian law firm that specialized in setting up offshore companies .
The `` Panama Papers '' revealed financial arrangements of politicians and public figures including friends of Russian President Vladimir Putin , relatives of the prime ministers of Britain , Iceland and Pakistan , and the president of Ukraine .
While holding money in offshore companies is not illegal , journalists who received the leaked documents said they could provide evidence of wealth hidden for tax evasion , money laundering , sanctions busting , drug deals or other crimes .
The law firm , Mossack Fonseca , which says it has set up more than 240,000 offshore companies for clients around the globe , denied any wrongdoing and called itself the victim of a campaign against privacy . Mossack Fonseca , in a statement posted on its website on Monday , said media reports had `` misrepresented the nature of our work . ''
`` We routinely resign from client engagements when ongoing due diligence and updates to sanction lists reveal that a beneficial owner of a company for which we provide services is compromised , '' it said .
The law firm added that `` excluding the professional fees we earn , we do not take possession or custody of clients ' money , or have anything to do with any of the direct financial aspects '' of their business operations .
Leading figures responded to the leaks with denials as prosecutors and regulators began a review of the reports from the investigation by the U.S.-based International Consortium of Investigative Journalists ( ICIJ ) .
The U.S. Department of Justice would determine whether there was evidence of corruption and other violations of U.S. law , a spokesperson said . A White House spokesperson said that `` in spite of the lack of transparency that exists in many of these transactions , '' there were U.S. experts who could find out whether they violated sanctions and laws .
Financial prosecutors in France announced the opening of a preliminary investigation for aggravated tax fraud .
Germany would also “ pick up the ball ” in the case , a Finance Ministry spokesperson said on Monday . Financial market watchdog Bafin is looking into the matter , said a source close to the regulator , which reports to the ministry .
Australia , Austria , Sweden and the Netherlands were among other countries that said they had begun investigating the allegations based on more than 11.5 million documents . Banks came under the spotlight over allegations they helped clients hide their wealth offshore .
In Argentina , political opposition parties demanded an explanation from center-right President Mauricio Macri because they served as a director of an offshore company in the Bahamas related to their wealthy father 's business in the past .
In a short television interview , Macri denied any wrongdoing and said the company their father founded was legal .
`` It was an offshore company to invest in Brazil , an investment that ultimately was n't completed , and where I was director , '' Macri said . `` There is nothing strange about this . ''
In Brazil , where a corruption crisis threatens President Dilma Rousseff 's administration , the O Estado de S.Paulo newspaper said politicians from seven parties were named as Mossack Fonseca clients . They did not include politicians from Rousseff 's Workers ' Party .
Brazil 's tax agency said it would verify information about offshore tax avoidance in the documents and could impose fines on undeclared assets in offshore accounts of up to 150 percent of their value .
FORTY YEARS
The documents , covering a period from 1977 until last December , were leaked to more than 100 news organizations around the world in cooperation with the ICIJ .
`` I think the leak will prove to be probably the biggest blow the offshore world has ever taken because of the extent of the documents , '' ICIJ Director Gerard Ryle said .
The Kremlin said the documents contained `` nothing concrete and nothing new , '' while a spokesperson for British Prime Minister David Cameron said their late father 's reported links to an offshore company were a `` private matter . ''
Pakistan denied any wrongdoing by the family of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif after their daughter and son were linked to offshore companies .
Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko defended their commitment to transparency after lawmakers called for an investigation into allegations in the documents that they had used an offshore firm to avoid tax . Poroshenko purportedly moved their confectionery business , Roshen , to the British Virgin Islands in August 2014 as fighting between Ukraine and pro-Russian separatists peaked .
`` I believe I might be the first top official in Ukraine who treats declaring of assets , paying taxes , conflict of interest issues seriously , '' Poroshenko tweeted .
Iceland 's prime minister , Sigmundur Gunnlaugsson , faced calls for their resignation after ICIJ said they and their wife were connected with a secretive company in an offshore haven . Their political opposition filed a no-confidence motion .
`` I certainly wo n't ( resign ) because what we 've seen is the fact that , well , my wife has always paid their taxes . We 've also seen that they have avoided any conflict of interest by investing in Icelandic companies at the same time that I 'm in politics , '' they told Reuters TV .
Britain 's Guardian newspaper said the documents showed a network of secret offshore deals and loans worth $ 2 billion led to associates of Putin , including concert cellist Sergei Roldugin , a childhood friend of the president . Reuters could not confirm those details .
Putin 's spokesperson dismissed the reports as `` Putinophobia '' .
The British government asked for a copy of the leaked data , which could be embarrassing for Cameron , who has spoken out against tax evasion and tax avoidance .
Their late father , Ian Cameron , a wealthy stockbroker , is mentioned in the files , alongside some members of their Conservative Party , former Conservative lawmakers and party donors , British media said .
Jennie Granger , head of enforcement and compliance at HM Revenue and Customs , said the government would examine the information `` and act on it swiftly and appropriately . ''
Cameron 's spokesperson declined to comment on whether the leader 's family had money invested in offshore funds set up by their father , saying it was a `` private matter '' .
The Australian Tax Office said it was investigating more than 800 wealthy Mossack Fonseca clients and had linked more than 120 of them to an associate offshore service provider located in Hong Kong , which it did not name .
`` We regret any misuse of companies that we incorporate or the services we provide and take steps to uncover or stop such use , '' the law firm 's statement said .
Media reports said the leaked data pointed to a link between a member of global soccer body FIFA 's ethics committee and a Uruguayan soccer official arrested last year as part of a U.S. probe into corruption in the sport . Mossack Fonseca said it had `` no connection or involvement with these matters in any way . ''
The British-based Tax Justice Network said too many offshore lawyers , accountants and bankers saw it as their role to shield their clients from financial regulations . Director John Christensen said in a statement that the law firm operated with `` extreme secrecy and discretion '' for their clients , `` which was attractive to many clients engaged in tax evasion , fraud , hiding conflicts of interest , and other white collar crimes . ''
The Paris-based Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development , which has pushed for more transparency on taxes , said Panama `` must put its house in order . '' OECD said it had warned G20 finance ministers before the leaks that Panama was backtracking on a commitment to share information on accounts with other governments .
`` The consequences of Panama 's failure to meet the international tax transparency standards are now out there in full public view , '' OECD Secretary General Angel Gurria said in a statement .

Jon Entine is executive director of the Genetic Literacy Project and principal of the public relations firm ESG MediaMetrics , whose clients included Monsanto . Entine portrays themselves as an objective authority on science , but evidence shows that they are a longtime PR operative with deep ties to the chemical industry and undisclosed industry funding . They play a central role in the agrichemical industry 's efforts to promote GMOs and pesticides , and attack critics .
A 2015 Monsanto PR document named the Genetic Literacy Project as an “ industry partner ” that could help “ orchestrate outcry ” against the World Health Organization 's cancer research panel for their finding that glyphosate , the main ingredient in Monsanto 's Roundup , is probably carcinogenic to humans .
Genetic Literacy Project origins : Jon Entine 's PR firm and a nonprofit with tobacco ties
Jon Entine is founder andprincipal of ESG MediaMetrics , a public relations firm that promised to “ address an unfilled frustration voiced by corporations… ” Entine 's clients from 2010-2015 ( according to archived web pages ) included Monsanto , the Vinyl Institute and Merisant , a Monsanto spin-off that manufacturesartificial sweeteners . In 2011 , ESG MediaMetrics registered theweb domain for GeneticLiteracyProject.org .
Entine was also at that time employed by Statistical Assessment Services ( STATS ) , a nonprofit group that journalists have described as “ disinformation campaign ” “ known for its defense of the chemical industry. ” According to anarchived version of the STATS website , Genetic Literacy Project was developed as a “ cross disciplinary program with STATS. ” Tax filings show that the Science Literacy Project , the parent organization of the Genetic Literacy Project , inherited the STATS tax ID number .
An investigation by the Milwaukee Journal Sentinelfound that STATS was a “ major player in the public relations campaign to discredit concerns about bisphenol A ” and that its parent organization , the Center for Media and Public Affairs , “ was paid in the 1990s by Philip Morris , the tobacco company , to pick apart stories critical of smoking. ” Entine was a director of the Center for Media and Public Affairs through June 2015 , according to tax forms .
Monsanto was a client of Entine 's PR firm , ESG MediaMetrics , which set up the domainregistration for GeneticLiteracy Project .
Partners with Monsanto to Spin GMOs and Pesticides
Documents obtained by U.S . Right to Know and from litigation against Monsanto show that Entine and the Genetic Literacy Project are central players in the agrichemical industry 's propaganda campaigns .
Ties to Syngenta / American Council on Science and Health
Jon Entine has partnered for years with the American Council on Science and Health ( ACSH ) , acorporate front groupthat Monsanto paid to help spin the WHO/IARC cancer report on glyphosate . Syngenta was also funding ACSH at the time that ACSH published Entine 's 2011 book , “ Scared to Death : How Chemophobia Threatens Public Health. ” The book defends atrazine , a pesticide manufactured by Syngenta .
In a 2012 article about Entine for Mother Jones , Tom Philpott described the circumstances leading up to the publication of the book . The article is based on internal documents , obtained by the Center for Media and Democracy , that described Syngenta 's PR campaign to get third-party allies to defend atrazine , and ACSH 's attempts to raise more money from Syngenta specifically to defend atrazine .
In a2009 email , ACSH staff asked Syngenta for an additional $ 100,000 , “ separate and distinct from general operating support Syngenta has been so generously providing over the years , ” to produce a paper and “ consumer-friendly booklet ” about atrazine . In 2011 , ACSH announcedEntine 's book as a “ companion friendly , abbreviated position paper ” written in response to the “ growing level of chemophobia — the irrational fear of chemicals — among the American public . ”
Entine told Philpott they had “ no idea ” Syngenta was funding ACSH .
Attacks on Scientists and Journalists
A key theme in Entine 's work is attacking scientists and journalists who report critically about the chemical industry , the oil industry or the health problems associated with their toxic products and practices . Some examples :
Reporting by Rust and Meg Kissinger in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel , and by Liza Gross in The Interceptin 2016 , describes how Entine 's former employers , STATS and Center for Media and Public Affairs , pioneered their methods of attacking journalists and media while working for Phillip Morris to defend cigarettes in the 1990s .
The Murky Funding Trail to Entine and the Genetic Literacy Project
Entine 's funding history is complex and opaque , but tax documents and their own disclosures reveal a pattern of funding from anonymous sources and right-wing foundations that push deregulation and climate science denial , as well as undisclosed funding from the biotechnology industry .
Inaccurate , ever-changing “ transparency ” note
The “ financial transparency ” note on the Genetic Literacy Project website is inaccurate , changes often and at times contradicts itself . For 2017 and 2018 , the Genetic Literacy Project claimed it received funding from a handful of foundations including the Templeton and Searle foundations , which are two of the leading funders of climate science denial efforts . GLP also notes funding from the Center for Food Integrity , a food-industry front group that receives money from Monsanto and also partners with Monsanto and Genetic Literacy Project to promote agrichemical industry PR .
In September 2016 , the “ disclosure ” note said GLP received no funding from corporations , but noted a $ 27,500 “ pass through ” from “ Academics Review Charitable Association , ” which appears not to exist . That group is apparently AcademicsReview.org , a front groupfunded by the agrichemical industry . The “ pass through ” was for the Biotech Literacy Project Boot Camp , an event funded by the agrichemical industry .
In March 2016 , GLP made no financial disclosures and Entine tried to distance GLP from their former employer STATS , claiming that STATS provided accounting services only to GLP from 2011-2014 and that the groups were n't involved with each other 's activities . But in 2012 , GLP said it was “ developed as a cross disciplinary program with STATS . ”
Center for Media and Public Affairs/George Mason University
For the fiscal year2014/2015 , according to tax records , Entine received $ 173,100 for their work as “ director ” at Center for Media and Public Affairs , a group based at George Mason University and founded by GMU ProfessorRobert Lichter.CMPAwas paid by Phillip Morrisin the 1990s to deflect concerns about tobacco , according to documents in the UCSF Tobacco Industry Library .
CMPA does not disclose its funders but has received funding from George Mason University Foundation , the leading recipient of donations affiliated with Charles Koch and Koch Industries.GMUF also received $ 5.3 million from Donors Trust and Donors Capital Fund between 2011-13 , according to the Guardian . These funds channel money from anonymous donors including corporations to campaigns and academics who push industry interests , as Greenpeace demonstrated in an undercover investigation .
STATS Payments and Loans
CMPA 's sister group , also founded by Lichter and based at GMU , was Statistical Assessment Services ( STATS ) , a nonprofit group that played a key role in chemical industry PR efforts to defend toxic products , according to reporting in The Intercept , Milwaukee Journal Sentinel , The Atlantic and Consumer Reports .
According to IRS forms :
CMPA has also loaned money to STATS , which “ due to inadequate funding ” has “ not been reimbursed. ” George Mason University Foundation , which does not disclose its funding , gave CMPA grants in those years . Tax records show :
CMPA loaned STATS $ 203,611 in 2012/2013 and $ 163,914 loan in 2013/2014
George Mason University Foundation granted $ 220,900 in2012/2013 and $ 75,670 in2013/2014 to CMPA .
Biotechnology industry funding to train scientists and journalists
In 2014 and 2015 , the Council for Biotechnology Information , which is funded byBASF , Bayer , DowDuPont and Monsanto Company , spent over $ 300,000 on two events organized by Genetic Literacy Project and the front group Academics Review to “ train scientists and journalists to frame the debate over GMOs and the toxicity of glyphosate , ” according to tax records and rep0rting in The Progressive . The events , called the Biotech Literacy Project boot camps , were held at the University of Florida in 2014 and UC Davis in 2015 . The agendas describe the events as “ communication skills training ” for scientists and journalists to help reframe the food safety and GMO debate , andpromised to provide scientists with the “ tools and support resources necessary to effectively engage the media and appear as experts in legislative and local government hearings , and other policy making and related outreach opportunities . ”
Faculty at the first first boot campincludedrepresentatives from the agrichemical industry , food industry front groups and trade groups , and pro-GMO academics including University of Florida Professor Kevin Folta , and University of Illinois Professor Emeritus Bruce Chassy , both of whom have accepted undisclosed funding from Monsanto and promote the GMOs and pesticides that Monsanto sales rely upon . Washington Post food columnist Tamar Haspel , who also acceptsmoney from agribusiness interests , wasthe journalist onfaculty .
Climate science denier funders
Major financial supporters of Entine 's former employer STATS and their current group Genetic Literacy Project include right-wing foundations – primarily Scaife Foundation , Searle Freedom Trust and Templeton Foundation – that are leading funders of climate science denial , according to a 2013 Drexel University study.See USRTK investigation : Climate Science Denial Network Funds Toxic Chemical Propaganda .
Chemical Industry Defense Guy
For many years , Entine has been a prominent defender of chemical industry interests , following the industry playbook : they defend the chemicals as safe ; argues against regulation ; and attacks science , scientists journalists and others raising concerns .
Defending Neonicotinoids
Growing scientific evidence suggests that neonicotinoids , the most widely used class of pesticides , are a key factor in bee die-offs . The European Union has restricted neonics due to concerns about impact on bees .
Entine :
Argues that neonics are not key driver of bee deaths ( American Enterprise Institute ) .
Attacked a Harvard professor 's study on bee Colony Collapse Disorder ( American Enterprise Institute ) .
Claimed neonics may actually help bee health ( American Enterprise Institute and Forbes ) .
Accused European politicians of trying to kill bees by restricting neonics ( Forbes ) .
Defending Phthalates
In August of 2012 , Entine defended vinyl plastic backpacks that were found to be exposing children to phthalates .
Entine wrote : “ Few chemicals on the market today have undergone as much scientific scrutiny as phthalate esters ” ( Forbes ) . They did n't mention that a significant body of scientific evidence compiled over two decades links phthalate exposures to abnormal reproductive development in baby boys .
Entine criticized an NBC reporter for “ shoddy journalism ” for raising questions about the safety of phthalates ( Forbes ) .
Entine 's communications firm , ESG MediaMetrics , had the Vinyl Institute as a client . However , Entine did not disclose that in their Forbes articles on phthalates .
Defending Fracking
Entine defends hydraulic fracturing ( “ fracking ” ) , the pumping of high-pressure chemical-laced water into the ground to crack shale and extract natural gas . As in their many other messaging campaigns , Entine blasts science and scientists who raise concerns , framing them as “ activists , ” while making sweeping and indefensible statements about “ scrupulous ” science conducted over many years that defend its safety .
For example , Entine claimed : “ From a scientific perspective , no reason exists to even suspect unknown health or environmental issues will turn up ” from fracking ( New York Post ) .
Entine also :
Accused New York Times reporters of misleading children about the potential environmental dangers of fracking ( Forbes ) .
Attacked two Cornell University scientists for their study suggesting that fracking operations leak methane ( Forbes ) .
Attacked the Park Foundation , claiming that it has “ almost single-handedly derailed shale-gas development in methane-rich New York State , and put its imprint on public opinion and policy decisions around the country. ” ( Philanthropy Roundtable )
Defending BPA
Entine writes in defense of the chemical bisphenol A ( BPA ) , despite a large body of scientific evidence raising concerns about its endocrine disrupting potential and other health problems associated with it . Canada declared the chemical to be toxic in 2010 , and the EUbanned BPA in baby bottles in 2011 .
Entine :
Attacked “ a small but determined group of university researchers , activist NGOs and journalists ” raising concerns about BPA ( Forbes ) .
Tells women who ca n't get pregnant not to blame it on plastics ( Forbes ) .
Challenged scientists linking BPA to heart disease ( Forbes ) .
Defending Nuclear Power
Entine :
Criticized Harvard Professor Naomi Oreskes for pointing out the economic and environmental risks of nuclear power ( Huffington Post ) .
Claims that nuclear power plants are environmentally benign and that “ Nothing as bad as Chernobyl is likely to occur in the West ” ( Jon Entine ) .
Argued that Germany is “ taking a gamble ” by transitioning away from nuclear power ( Ethical Corporation )
Fellowships
Entine was an unpaid fellow at the Center for Health and Risk Communication at George Mason University ( GMU ) from 2011-2014.Entine is also a former senior fellow at the UC Davis World Food Center 's Institute for Food and Agricultural Literacy , which does not disclose its donors , and a visiting fellow at the American Enterprise Institute , a DC think tank funded in part by corporate and dark money contributions .

If you have been watching CNN , you know Anderson Cooper has been reporting about the discovery that a sitting judge is actually a robot . Their name is Gonzalo Curiel and they are presiding over the Trump University case .
Curiel looks human on the outside , and they have passed as human for decades . But Cooper made it clear in their interviews yesterday that while science understands that 100 % of humans are biased about just about everything , this robot judge is not susceptible to being influenced by their life experiences . It sounds deeply implausible , but no one on CNN challenged Cooper 's implication that Judge Curiel is the only bias-free entity in the universe . Ergo , they must be a robot .
Anyway , lots of folks on Twitter are asking me why Trump would accuse the robot judge of being “ Mexican ” when that is obviously a racist thing to say . Did Trump make a huge mistake , or is it some sort of clever persuasion thing ?
Let 's dig into that .
For starters , it is n't appropriate to label people – or robots – “ Mexicans ” if those people or robots are created in America . For example , I have an American friend with Italian heritage who often refers to themselves as “ Italian , ” and obviously that is a case of self-racism . I find it offensive .
This problem is n't limited to my one friend . I also know an American who calls themselves Croatian and another American who calls themselves Indian . I can barely stand to be in the same room with those racists . Worse yet , they seem unclear about the distinction between their ethnicity and the country where their parents grew up . It is n't the same thing , people !
But right-and-wrong aside , is it a good legal strategy for Trump to sow doubts about the objectivity of the robot judge ? It seems to me that the trial can go one of two ways .
1 . Trump wins in court , in which case , Trump wins .
2 . Trump loses in court , in which case , Trump says Democrats rigged the system to give them an unfair trial . We 're already primed to believe it .
From a legal perspective , race is not a reason to remove a judge . I have n't heard anyone argue otherwise . But from a persuasion perspective , Trump is setting the stage for whatever is to come . So yes , it is smart , albeit offensive .
Some have asked why Trump 's legal team has n't asked for the judge to be replaced . My guess is that they want to keep them because they expect to lose the case and they plan to pin it on the judge . That 's how I would play it .
The one small problem with Trump 's strategy of questioning the robot 's objectivity is that it creates one more point of confirmation bias that Trump is a racist . Here 's what we have so far :
1 . Trump wants to protect the melting pot that is America from the non-Americans who want to get into the country illegally . That 's the job of the President , and yet…it sounds a bit racist . That 's point-one of confirmation bias .
2 . Trump said immigrants from Mexico are rapists . Under normal circumstances , a listener would understand them to mean that the socioeconomic circumstances of being an immigrant are correlated with higher-than-average crime rates of all types . But because you think Trump is a racist , your cognitive dissonance turned it into an accusation that all Mexican men , women , children , and unborn babies are rapists .
To make things worse , Trump is pro-life . The implication is that Trump believes one-month-old fetuses from Mexico somehow escape the womb at night to do their raping . It sounds implausible , but once you know Trump is a racist who thinks every single Mexican is a rapist , you have to assume they were talking about the fetuses too . That 's a tell for confirmation bias .
3 . During one CNN interview Trump did not disavow the KKK in a clear and quick fashion that viewers expected . They did disavow the KKK and David Duke before the interview , and plenty of times afterwards . But that one time on live television they did n't hear the question ( he says ) and they responded inadequately . It seems implausible that a candidate for president would intentionally avoid disavowing the KKK on live TV , but once you assume Trump is a racist , confirmation bias kicks in , and you assume they did just that .
4 . Trump suggested a temporary ban on Muslim immigration until we can figure out what 's going on . That sounds totally racist…unless you know that Islam is open to all ethnicities…and as practiced in many places is incompatible with the Constitution of the United States . And ISIS is trying to get terrorists into the country by posing as immigrants . Viewed in isolation , the ban on Muslim immigration is offensive and problematic . But viewed in context with all of the other confirmation bias about Trump , it turns into evidence of racism .
5 . And now Trump believes a judge might be biased because their parents grew up in Mexico . On one hand , every person in the world thinks that is a legitimate risk . On the other hand , when viewed in context of all of Trump 's other confirmation bias , it looks racist as hell .
I 'm probably leaving out a few points of confirmation bias . But you get the point . Once you see Trump as a probable racist , you see “ evidence ” everywhere , even if there is none . That 's confirmation bias .
Judges have bias too . Except for the robot kind like Curiel .
For new readers , I endorse Hillary Clinton , but only for my my personal safety . I do n't agree with any of the candidates on policies .

With autumn upon us and winter beginning its descent , let 's strike up the Anvil Chorus in honor of all the craniums that , like so many precious and unique hammers , will soon hit something really hard really fast .
Watch as the courageous year-round cyclist hits a schmear of slimy leaves , gets waylaid by some black ice , or bunny-hops into a wet trolley track . Oof ! Observe the coon-eyed mountain Chad as they stray into a feral pack of heedless snowboarders , gets cocky on some double-black vertical , or yard-sales after hucking off a sweet jump . Pow !
Good thing they 're wearing helmets . But if that 's you lying there in your snazzy helmet , what if you still do n't wake up ? Get KO 'd or suffer a serious outage and you 'll most likely lie there and collect angel tears – unless you were smart and/or paranoid enough to drop 150 beans on an ICEdot Crash Sensor .
This miniature brain is roughly the size of a soft drink bottlecap . It attaches to any helmet – clipped into a vent , as pictured , or stuck on with a super-sticker – and registers impacts via both a three-axis gyroscope and a three-axis accelerometer . A proprietary algorithm determines whether the hit exceeds brain-trauma threshold . If there 's cause for worry , the ICEdot alerts your phone over low-energy Bluetooth . This triggers the ICEdot app to sound an alarm and begin a countdown . If you do n't wake up and turn it off before it times out , the app texts your GPS coordinates to your emergency contacts .
Sound complicated ? It is , but not for the user . Setup is simple and fast : Register online , download the app , connect with the sensor , and you 're done . ICEdot includes stickers ( and sells an optional wristband ) that can link EMTs and any other good Samaritans to your profile . Right now , the ICEdot app is available only for iPhone 4s and 5 , but an Android 4.3 version is in the works .
How to build a serverless NodeJS microservice on AWS Lambda
Paul Matthew Jaworski Blocked Unblock Follow Sep 18 , 2016
DEPRECATED
Unfortunately , since I wrote this article , v1.0 of the Serverless Framework has been released , along with some breaking changes . I believe that you can migrate to the new version simply by adding :
integration : lambda
to each of your resources . For example :
createPet :
handler : handler.create
events :
- http :
path : pets
method : POST
cors : true
integration : lambda
However , I have decided to move on from Serverless for now , mainly due to issues with authentication , authorization , and frustrations with DynamoDB , so I wo n't be updating this post . I will explore these issues and my decision to switch back to a “ traditional ” REST API in a later story .
For now , I would recommend referencing the official Serverless docs on API Gateway to get started , and possibly using the rest of this post as a reference , bearing in mind that any information in the Serverless docs takes precedence over anything written here .
Proceed from here with caution :
In this article , I 'll share my experience going “ serverless ” and building a CRUD API “ microservice ” using AWS Lambda , API Gateway , and DynamoDB . This will function as a guide for you to make your own microservices with these tools .
Getting Started
I 'm going to assume you have an AWS account and NodeJS installed . If not , handle that now .
Next you 'll need to install the Serverless npm package , which provides a way to easily create , edit , and deploy microservices as AWS Lambda functions :
npm install -g serverless
Then follow Amazon 's instructions on creating an IAM user and configuring Serverless to use those credentials .
Navigate to the directory where you want to store your new project and run :
serverless create -- template aws-nodejs -- path pets-service
Now 's a good time to set up linting in your project . Since this is not an intro to ESLint , I wo n't go into full detail , but I 'd recommend installing that now and setting up your .eslintrc like this :
{
“ plugins ” : [ “ node ” ] ,
“ extends ” : [ “ eslint : recommended ” , “ plugin : node/recommended ” ] ,
“ env ” : {
“ node ” : true ,
“ mocha ” : true
} ,
“ rules ” : {
“ no-console ” : 0 ,
“ node/no-unsupported-features ” : [ 2 , { “ version ” : 4 } ]
}
}
The important thing to note here is the “ no-unsupported-features ” rule from the node plugin . AWS Lambda uses Node v4.3 , and knowing which ES6 features are available can be a pain in the ass . This makes it easy .
Creating the Handler
Install the aws-sdk and lodash with npm :
npm i -S aws-sdk lodash
Now head over to handler.js and add those dependencies to the top of your file :
const aws = require ( ‘ aws-sdk ' ) ;
const _ = require ( ‘ lodash/fp ' ) ;
Note that we 're using the “ functional programming ” variant of lodash because It 's merge function wo n't mutate the original object .
Below that , set up your document client for communicating with DynamoDB :
const dynamo = new aws.DynamoDB.DocumentClient ( ) ;
Now let 's make our create ( ) function to make a new Pet in the database :
exports.create = function ( event , context ) {
const payload = {
TableName : 'Pets ' ,
Item : event.body
} ;
const cb = ( err , data ) = > {
if ( err ) {
console.log ( err ) ;
context.fail ( ‘ Error creating pet ' ) ;
} else {
console.log ( data ) ;
context.succeed ( data ) ;
}
}
dynamo.put ( payload , cb ) ;
} ;
It 's pretty easy to see what 's going on here for the most part :
We get an event object passed in with a key body that contains the data we want to store . The DocumentClient requires at minimum an object with the keys TableName and Item to be passed into put ( ) .
We also provide a callback that does two important things :
If there is an error , we run context.fail ( ) , which is basically just an onError callback provided by AWS .
If the item creation is successful , we run context.succeed ( ) , passing in the data to be returned as the result of our Lambda function .
An important caveat with DynamoDB is that we must provide the primary key ourselves on creation . In this case , we have to include petId as a key in our event.body object .
Why is such a basic feature missing from DynamoDB ? Your guess is as good as mine .
I 'm fortunate enough in my application to have a unique ID generated for me by Auth0 , which I 'm using for my auth/user management . You 'll have to solve this problem some other way if you 're not .
We 'll follow this same basic pattern for the rest of our CRUD operations :
exports.show = function ( event , context ) {
const payload = {
TableName : 'Pets ' ,
Key : {
petId : event.params.path.petId
}
}
const cb = ( err , data ) = > {
if ( err ) {
console.log ( err ) ;
context.fail ( 'Error retrieving pet ' ) ;
} else {
console.log ( data ) ;
context.done ( null , data ) ;
}
}
dynamo.get ( payload , cb ) ;
} ;
exports.list = function ( event , context ) {
const payload = {
TableName : 'Pets '
}
const cb = ( err , data ) = > {
if ( err ) {
console.log ( err ) ;
context.fail ( 'Error getting pets ' ) ;
} else {
console.log ( data ) ;
context.done ( null , data ) ;
}
}
dynamo.scan ( payload , cb ) ;
}
exports.update = function ( event , context ) {
const payload = {
TableName : 'Pets ' ,
Key : {
petId : event.params.path.petId
}
} ;
dynamo.get ( payload , ( err , data ) = > {
if ( err ) {
console.log ( err ) ;
context.fail ( 'No pet with that id exists . ' ) ;
} else {
const item = _.merge ( data.Item , event.body ) ;
payload.Item = item ;
dynamo.put ( payload , ( putErr , putData ) = > {
if ( putErr ) {
console.log ( 'Error updating pet . ' ) ;
console.log ( putErr ) ;
context.fail ( 'Error updating pet . ' ) ;
} else {
console.log ( 'Success ! ' ) ;
console.log ( putData ) ;
context.done ( null , item ) ;
}
} ) ;
}
} ) ;
}
exports.delete = function ( event , context ) {
const payload = {
TableName : 'Pets ' ,
Key : {
petId : event.params.path.petId
}
} ;
const cb = ( err , data ) = > {
if ( err ) {
console.log ( err ) ;
context.fail ( 'Error retrieving pet ' ) ;
} else {
console.log ( data ) ;
context.done ( null , data ) ;
}
}
dynamo.delete ( payload , cb ) ;
}
There are just a couple things to note here :
We want to be able to do partial updates , meaning you do n't need to send the entire Pet object with its changes , you can just send the changes . To accomplish this , we 're calling a get first in the update ( ) function , then merging our changes into the result of that operation .
Our petId is passed in as a parameter to API Gateway and then provided to us in Lambda via event.params.path.petId . You could also use query strings if you prefer .
Configuring Serverless
We 're almost done here , so now let 's get our Serverless config files set up . Open up serverless.yml and edit it to look like this :
service : pets-service
provider :
name : aws
runtime : nodejs4.3
defaults :
stage : dev
region : us-west-2
functions :
createPet :
handler : handler.create
events :
- http :
path : pets
method : POST
showPet :
handler : handler.show
events :
- http :
path : pets/ { petId }
method : GET
listPets :
handler : handler.list
events :
- http :
path : pets
method : GET
updatePet :
handler : handler.update
events :
- http :
path : pets/ { petId }
method : PUT
deletePet :
handler : handler.delete
events :
- http :
path : pets/ { petId }
method : DELETE
This is pretty easy to understand , I think . We 're just specifying the names of our Lambda functions , then mapping them to our handler.js functions and the HTTP methods and paths we want them to respond to .
I 've changed defaults to use ‘ us-west-2 ' as my region , and kept ‘ dev ' as my stage . Setting up different stages with Serverless is not something I have fully explored .
The documentation is very lacking right now , but this configuration will result in an API Gateway named “ dev-pets-service ” being created , even though that 's not really what we want .
API Gateways should n't have the environment referenced in their name at all , since they can hold multiple environments or “ stages . ”
Hopefully I 'll find a fix for this and publish it in a future edit ; )
Deploying and Testing Our Service
Now we 're ready to deploy ! All it takes is running :
serverless deploy
In a minute or so , your Lambda functions should be deployed , and your API Gateway created .
Create a DynamoDB table named ‘ Pets ' ( or whatever you 're calling your resource ) . Then head to API Gateway . Find your ‘ dev-pets-service ' , and navigate to the POST method .
Test your API by clicking on the “ TEST ” button with the lightning bolt and using the following data :
{ petId : `` 029340 '' , name : `` Fido '' , type : `` dog '' }
You should have successfully created a new item in your database !
What 's Next ?
Your next steps might be enabling CORS for your resources , using a custom domain name for your API , and setting up your front end app to talk to these endpoints .
This is all beyond the scope of the article , and should be pretty simple , but let me know in the comments if you have questions .
EDIT
User jcready on Reddit has suggested an improvement to our update method :
exports.update = function ( event , context ) {
const payload = _.reduce ( event.body , ( memo , value , key ) = > {
memo.ExpressionAttributeNames [ ` # $ { key } ` ] = key
memo.ExpressionAttributeValues [ ` : $ { key } ` ] = value
memo.UpdateExpression.push ( ` # $ { key } = : $ { key } ` )
return memo
} , {
TableName : 'Pets ' ,
Key : { petId : event.params.path.petId } ,
UpdateExpression : [ ] ,
ExpressionAttributeNames : { } ,
ExpressionAttributeValues : { }
} )
payload.UpdateExpression = 'SET ' + payload.UpdateExpression.join ( ' , ' )
dynamo.update ( payload , context.done )
}
The issue with our current implementation is that a user could overwrite another 's changes if two update requests are sent at once .
DocumentClient provides us with an update method that allows us to specify the fields we want to update , but the syntax is a little odd and requires generating an “ UpdateExpression ” to achieve these changes .
This code builds that expression based on the keys passed in and solves the problem of overwriting updates in an application where resources are shared between users .

Knile Davis does n't want their fumble in the playoffs to define him , but they also know they might not get the chance to redeem themselves in Kansas City .
But they also said they did n't ask to be traded this offseason , even after the Chiefs signed two running backs who were not them to extensions .
“ I hope so , but that 's not up to me , ” Davis said of staying in Kansas City , via Adam Teicher of ESPN.com . “ This is my team . I 'm under contract . I 'm here until I 'm not . ”
Davis had a chance to play in the postseason , after injuries knocked out Jamaal Charles , Spencer Ware , and Charcandrick West . And things seemed promising , at least until their third quarter fumble killed any chance Kansas City had of beating the Patriots .
“ It was probably my best game for a while , ” Davis said . “ I was effective on kickoff returns , caught all my [ passes ] , ran good routes , averaged five [ yards ] per pop .
“ And then [ came ] the fumble . ”
Oh yes , that .
If it were an isolated event , it might be easier to overlook , but Davis has n't been the most sure-handed back in the league prior to that , never quite living up to their third-round status . And with kickoff returns minimized with rules changes , their job was already tenuous .
“ I feel like I 've showed glimpses of good ability , ” Davis said . “ I just need an opportunity . Some people in this league wait six years for their opportunity . Some people get theirs quicker than others . The name of this business is stayed healthy and be patient and that 's what I 'm doing .
“ At this point I can pretty much do it all . I just have n't had the opportunity to show it . That 's a hard deal . But one day I will get the opportunity to show what I can do and I 'm looking forward to that day . ”
Of course , the Chiefs signed Ware and West to contract extensions this offseason , so Davis might be forced to wait for free agency for a chance to redeem himself .
Ainsley Maitland-Niles ( centre ) scored their first senior goal
Ainsley Maitland-Niles scored their first senior goal as Ipswich beat Bolton for their first win since 15 September .
The 18-year-old , on loan from Arsenal , found the back of the net with a low left-foot finish from 25 yards .
Brett Pitman marked their return to Ipswich 's starting line-up with their fourth goal of the season as their rasping shot secured all three points .
Wanderers failed to really test keeper Dean Gerken as their winless run stretched to nine games .
The hosts dominated proceedings and took the lead after just 13 minutes through their young winger .
Pitman was unlucky not to score in the first half as their goalbound effort from Daryl Murphy 's cross was cleared off the line by Jose Manuel Casado .
Substitute Jonathan Douglas continued Ipswich 's barrage on Bolton 's goal early in the second half , with the midfielder 's stinging shot from the edge of the box rattling the bar .
With the visitors looking unlikely to score , a brilliant piece of play between Freddie Sears and Pitman split the Bolton defence before the latter netted from a tight angle .
Bolton remains in the relegation places having won just one Championship game this season .
Ipswich manager Mick McCarthy :
`` We have played well in recent games and not got the result , so to get the win is a relief .
`` I would have taken a scruffy shinner or an own goal to get back to winning ways but our performance was outstanding .
`` We had a difficult spell in the first half but we weathered that storm . It was great to get a clean sheet , which was a team effort , and some of the play from the front lads was terrific . ''
Bolton manager Neil Lennon :
`` There was a mental fragility but on the basis of previous games , I do think we have the squad .
`` We need to start showing moral courage to score goals and put our foot in . There is no point being a nice team - we have to start winning games .
`` I thought we were in the game in the first half , but we never competed in the second half .
`` If you do n't compete in this division , especially against a Mick McCarthy side , you will get beat . ''

Nokia is winding down its high-end virtual reality camera division .
The Ozo and its follow-up the Ozo+ had been marketed to professionals as being able to capture the `` highest quality '' 360-degree footage possible , and had been used by Disney among others .
But despite a recent price cut , the Finnish firm indicated that sales had been weaker than expected .
One expert said it reflected the fact that public appetite for VR content was still very limited .
In a statement , Nokia said it now planned to dedicate its efforts to developing smart health products instead , and would leave it to others to build on its work in VR .
`` The slower-than-expected development of the VR market means that Nokia Technologies plans to reduce investments and focus more on technology licensing opportunities , '' it said .
`` The unit aims to halt development of further versions of the Ozo camera and hardware , while maintaining commitments to existing customers . ''
Image copyright Nokia Image caption The camera 's price restricted its audience almost solely to professionals
It added that 310 jobs were being cut as a consequence , affecting posts in Finland , the UK and US .
Helicopter shots
The original Ozo was first unveiled in July 2015 . The handheld device featured eight cameras and the same number of microphones in order to capture both spherical video and spatial sound .
It initially had a $ 60,000 ( £45,500 ) price tag , bringing it in line with the kind of other cameras commonly used for Hollywood movies and TV commercials .
Disney was one of the early adopters , using the equipment to create interactive behind-the-scenes footage for its Jungle Book film .
It was also used by London-based production house Alchemy VR for a forthcoming natural history documentary about the Galapagos Islands . The company 's head of production welcomed the possibilities that its relatively small size opened up .
Image copyright Nokia Image caption Nokia brought out a second-generation product earlier this year at a lower price than the original
`` The Ozo is probably the simplest camera in the world to use , '' Ian Syder told the TVTechGlobal news site .
`` It 's really changed the way we do VR . Suddenly , the riskier shots are possible - you can put it on a motorised dolly [ cart ] , or strap it to a helicopter . ''
However , others were more critical .
The UK-based production house SpeedVR warned clients that the file sizes which the camera created were huge , and that it struggled with scenes featuring shadows or highlights .
`` For around a tenth of the price you can get higher quality elsewhere , '' it blogged last year .
In April , Nokia announced a follow-up system - the Ozo+ - promising better dynamic range and sharper , cleaner images to address clients ' criticisms .
Image copyright Nokia Image caption The amount of storage required and processing time involved add to the costs of using Ozo
It went on sale for $ 45,000 but was discounted to $ 25,000 five months later .
`` The Ozo has clearly been a much smaller niche product than Nokia anticipated , '' commented Ben Wood from the CCS Insight tech consultancy .
`` The challenge was that this was extremely early stage technology and users often found it took a long time to process the content .
`` And unfortunately , 360-degree content and virtual reality more broadly have not taken off as quickly as many in the industry had hoped - despite the support of platforms including Facebook and YouTube . ''
On the internet today , all our web sites need a strong , secure HTTPS setup , even the most basic static sites . This is part two of a series on how to set up Nginx securely .
When we left off after part 1 , we had a server with a valid , signed certificate , but it was using the default Nginx configuration . This configuration is far from optimal .
At the end of this post we 'll have a secure HTTPS configuration on Nginx that scores an A+ rating on the SSL Labs report . We 'll even do a few extra tweaks that improve performance and user experience .
In addition to the descriptions and code snippets here , I 've compiled a ready to go SSL configuration file for Nginx , a nearly ready to go example site configuration file , and a complete list of all the sources I used while researching for these articles , and posted them for anyone to use freely on Github .
Disable SSLv3
By default Nginx still enables SSLv3 , which has been vulnerable to the POODLE attack since October 2014 . The only browser that does n't support newer protocols out of the box is IE6 , and even it can be configured to use TLSv1 , so there 's no reason to support SSLv3 anymore .
SSL Labs rightly limits your server 's SSL score to C if SSLv3 is enabled , so this is the first thing to change .
1 2 3 # support only known-secure cryptographic protocols # SSLv3 is broken by POODLE as of October 2014 ssl_protocols TLSv1 TLSv1.1 TLSv1.2 ;
Send the Entire Certificate Chain
Browsers use root certificates from Certificate Authorities to determine which server certificates ( such as the one from your website ) should be trusted , but there 's almost always an intermediate certificate . To be sure your server 's certificate is valid , browsers need to know about this intermediate certificate .
Of course , browsers can find and download these intermediate certificates , but this slows down the process of connecting to your website , and makes the whole process more complicated giving attackers more surface area to exploit .
An incomplete certificate chain
It 's much better to simply configure Nginx to send this intermediate certificate along when users first connect . In fact , your SSL score is capped at a B if you do n't .
Your Certificate Authority probably provided you with links to download your intermediate certificate , so once you 've found it , put it somewhere safe on your server , and tell Nginx about it like this , and then make a new file that concatenates your certificate and the intermediate certificate together . Then tell Nginx about that one like this :
1 2 # send intermediate certificate during new sessions ssl_trusted_certificate /etc/nginx/ssl/startssl/sub.class1.server.ca.pem ;
Ciphersuite Configuration
The SSL/TLS protocols actually do n't provide any encryption by themselves . Instead , they simply allow a server and client to agree on and start communicating via a channel that could have one of any number of encryption schemes .
Your server and a client will use SSL/TLS to agree on a combination of four things : key exchange algorithm ( how to safely share encryption keys between the server and client ) , authentication ( to make sure only the intended sender/recipient are communicating ) , encryption algorithm ( actually encoding the messages so no one else can read them ) , and message digest algorithm ( to make sure the message was not tampered with or corrupted ) .
There are many of each of these algorithms , all with varying features , performance , cryptographic strength , and browser support . Many of the algorithms have known weaknesses that make them unsuitable for use today . Using the latest version of a browser is usually enough to protect an individual user but , unfortunately , a lot of older browsers have insecure defaults .
The goal of cipher suite configuration is to ensure compatibility with as many browsers as possible , without compromising security or , to a lesser extent , performance .
This will be done by setting a configuration string that OpenSSL understands in our Nginx configuration . To keep thing simple here 's the relevant configuration lines :
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 # make the server choose the best cipher instead of the browser # Perfect Forward Secrecy ( PFS ) is frequently compromised without this ssl_prefer_server_ciphers on ; # support only believed secure ciphersuites using the following priority : # 1 . ) prefer PFS enabled ciphers # 2 . ) prefer AES128 over AES256 for speed ( AES128 has completely adequate security for now ) # 3 . ) Support DES3 for IE8 support # # disable the following ciphersuites completely # 1 . ) null ciphers # 2 . ) ciphers with low security # 3 . ) fixed ECDH cipher ( does not allow for PFS ) # 4 . ) known vulnerable cypers ( MD5 , RC4 , etc ) # 5 . ) little-used ciphers ( Camellia , Seed ) ssl_ciphers 'kEECDH+ECDSA+AES128 kEECDH+ECDSA+AES256 kEECDH+AES128 kEECDH+AES256 kEDH+AES128 kEDH+AES256 DES-CBC3-SHA +SHA ! aNULL ! eNULL ! LOW ! kECDH ! DSS ! MD5 ! EXP ! PSK ! SRP ! CAMELLIA ! SEED ' ;
Now I 'll explain the rationale that went into crafting it .
Make the server choose the ciphersuite
Many browsers , especially old ones , will make poor ciphersuite choices on their own . The first directive ensures your server will choose from the list of ciphersuites supported by both the browser and server .
Disable null and low security ciphersuites
Strangely , it 's possible for SSL/TLS to use no encryption if configured improperly . Fortunately it is easy to disable this . OpenSSL also has its own internal list of ciphersuites with known low security , and disabling This is a good starting point .
Disable insecure algorithms
Some algorithms have known or suspected vulnerabilities , and we can disable or limit their use where appropriate . The following algorithms in particular should be disabled :
MD5 : completely broken , still common
The MD5 hashing algorithm is commonly used but has had known weaknesses since 1996 , only 4 years after it was introduced . Today , MD5 is famously vulnerable to collisions , especially with GPUs . It simply is n't safe to use any more .
RC4 : former poster child , recently tarnished
The RC4 cypher is also commonly used , and until recently was widely recommended . However , information revealed by no less than Edward Snowden themselves has suggested that it 's possible the NSA has the ability to break RC4 .
Combined with research showing theoretical vulnerabilities in RC4 , the possibility that there are working attacks against RC4 in the wild is too plausible to ignore . Microsoft has issued a security advisory to disable RC4 , and the IETF is drafting a memo to require clients and servers never use RC4 .
SHA1 : rapidly approaching affordable attacks
In part 1 we generated a certificate request using SHA256 instead of SHA1 . For the same reasons , we also have to disable ciphersuites that use SHA1 as the hashing algorithm . No attacks against SHA1 have succeeded as of today , as far as we know , but it probably wo n't be long .
Disable little-used ciphers
These are not common , and disabling them just simplifies things and reduces the surface area for attacks .
Support perfect forward secrecy whenever possible
Perfect forward secrecy allows a secure connection to use encryption keys that are custom generated for that specific session . The security advantage this provides is incredible : even if the private key for a server is compromised , none of the messages sent to that server in the past can be decoded .
Furthermore , even if an attacker manages to successfully compromise a session key used by your server , they only gain access to a single session . This increases the cost , and decreases the reward , of attacking communication with your server .
A great recent example of this is Heartbleed : with perfect forward secrecy , the Heartbleed vulnerability can only expose individual sessions . You 'd still have to update your server 's private key , but almost all user data would be safe even if your private key were exposed .
Most reasonably modern browsers , with the notable exception of IE8 , support key exchange algorithms with perfect forward secrecy .
There is one additional configuration change that needs to be made to keep PFS ciphersuites secure . By default Nginx will generate 1024-bit RSA keys for PFS ciphers , but that can be overridden . Use the configuration changes below and be sure to use openssl to generate the 2048-bit keys ( it can take a few minutes ) .
1 2 3 4 5 # Use 2048 bit Diffie-Hellman RSA key parameters # ( otherwise Nginx defaults to 1024 bit , lowering the strength of encryption # when using PFS ) # Generated by OpenSSL with the following command : # openssl dhparam -outform pem -out /etc/nginx/ssl/dhparam2048.pem 2048 ssl_dhparam /etc/nginx/ssl/dhparam2048.pem ;
Optimize for performance where appropriate
Despite some algorithms occasionally being found vulnerable , modern browsers actually support a comprehensive suite of extremely powerful security tools . All four algorithms specified by NIST for Suite B cryptography , including AES and SHA2 , are currently supported by a good portion of the browsers in use today .
Many security experts consider that using the longest key lengths currently supported does not have any measurable impact on security , and simply reduces performance .
A common configuration that takes this into account is to support these most secure variants , but prefer more reasonable key lengths . For example , the configuration above supports both the ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-SHA384 and ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-SHA256 ciphersuites , but prefers the shorter key length variant . Both provide excellent security with no known attacks . This makes the default for most users secure and reasonably performant , but allows users to demand the most secure ciphersuites if they so desire .
Enable HSTS
Many concepts in security involve correctly implementing a specific , precise procedure like a cryptographic algorithm to achieve a mathematically proven level of security . HSTS is not one of them .
Enabling HSTS simply tells browsers not to make any plain text requests to a server ever again .
In theory , this provides no benefits over a server properly configured to require a valid HTTPS connection for all resources , at all times . In practice , HSTS protects against a huge number of configuration errors that are easy to make .
It 's also easy to implement : all that is required is for the server to send a valid HSTS header with each HTTP request , and the browser will do the rest .
1 2 # enable HSTS including subdomains add_header Strict-Transport-Security 'max-age=31536000 ; includeSubDomains ; '
This tells browsers to avoid plain HTTP requests to your server and all subdomains for one year . It 's perfectly reasonable to remove the includeSubdomains clause if not all your subdomains are ready for HTTPS .
Note that by enabling HSTS , you are essentially promising to browsers that your server will correctly respond to HTTPS requests until the header expires . This means It 's probably not something that should be enabled on day one of an HTTPS roll out .
Once you 're comfortably set up running HTTPS with no problems , you can also submit your site for HSTS Preload , allowing the latest versions of popular browsers to ship already knowing your server expects only HTTPS requests . This is incredible : modern browsers will never make even one HTTP request to your server .
The security benefits of HSTS are profound enough that SSL Labs requires it as the final prerequisite of an A+ SSL rating .
Improve Performance
Finally , there are a few more configuration changes that should be made to improve performance . As far as I know these either have no detrimental impact on security , or actually help improve it .
Set up OCSP Stapling
Before a browser will connect to a server using HTTPS , it has to check if the certificate the server is using is still valid . An upgrade or response to an attack could cause a certificate to be revoked , and It 's important to know about it .
Without further action on your part , every browser connecting to your server will have to pause when first connecting to ask an OCSP server for the latest revocation information for . OCSP stapling allows your server to do this ahead of time . The OCSP responses are signed by your Certification Authority , so browsers will be able to trust them , even if they come directly from your server .
This also cuts down on traffic to OCSP servers ( a nice thing for you to do ) , and protects your server against unexpected interruptions because of downtime or denial of service attacks against your OCSP server .
1 2 # allow Nginx to send OCSP results during the connection process ssl_stapling on ;
Support SSL Session Caching
By far the biggest concern when moving to HTTPS is performance : both extra load on servers , and slower page load times on the user side . By large , the overhead for an established secure session is not significant anymore .
However , the process of initially connecting via HTTPS involves many more round trips between client and server than HTTP , so there is still definitely a noticeable impact on page load times .
With that in mind , it makes sense to cache SSL sessions for at least a few minutes , so that users only have to pay that cost once . Nginx is almost configured correctly out of the box to do this . The only change needed is setting a size limit for the session cache . The actual timeout is specified with ssl_session_timeout , which defaults to 5 minutes . The 10MB cache size limit is suggested by Nginx 's own HTTPS configuration guide :
1 2 3 4 # Cache SSL Sessions for up to 10 minutes # This improves performance by avoiding the costly session negotiation process where possible ssl_session_cache builtin : 1000 shared : SSL:10m ; # ssl_session_timeout 5m ; # this is a default , but can be changed
Resources and Thanks
I hope this guide can be considered comprehensive enough to be useful , but I would be lying if I said it was even close to covering everything . Security is a complicated , rapidly changing challenge . With that in mind I want to call out some of the best resources I 've found both to provide more information and thank the authors of these great works .
An estimated 3 million adult American handgun owners carry a firearm loaded and on their person on a daily basis , and 9 million do so on a monthly basis , new research indicates . The vast majority cited protection as their primary reason for carrying a firearm .
Researchers from the University of Washington , the University of Colorado , Harvard University and Northeastern University produced the study , published October 19 in the American Journal of Public Health .
It is the first research in more than 20 years to scrutinize why , how often , and in what manner U.S. adults carry loaded handguns . It also examines how concealed handgun-carrying behavior differs across states , depending on their laws .
Ali Rowhani-Rahbar , the study 's lead author , is an epidemiologist and injury-prevention specialist .
“ Carrying firearms in public places can have significant implications for public health and public safety , ” said lead author Dr. Ali Rowhani-Rahbar , an associate professor of epidemiology at the UW School of Public Health . “ An important first step to examining the consequences of firearm carrying at the national level is an accurate measurement of the occurrence of this behavior and characterization of those who engage in it . ”
Compared with handgun owners who did not carry , those who did report carrying handguns tended to be younger , and more often male , live in the southern United States , have grown up in firearm-owning households , self-identify as politically conservative , and own more than one type of firearm .
Rowhani-Rahbar and doctoral student Vivian Lyons collaborated with Drs . Matthew Miller of Northeastern , Deborah Azrael of Harvard , and Joseph Simonetti of Colorado . They reviewed handgun-carrying behavior of 1,444 gun owners , using data from a 2015 nationally representative survey designed by Miller and Azrael .
“ It was important to study handgun carrying because about 90 percent of all firearm homicides and nonfatal firearm crimes for which the type of firearm is known are committed with a handgun , ” said Rowhani-Rahbar , who is also an adjunct assistant professor of pediatrics at the UW School of Medicine .
Among the findings : 80 percent of surveyed handgun owners who carried their handgun had a concealed-carry permit , and 66 percent said they always carried their handguns concealed , compared with 10 percent who said they always carry their weapons openly .

When comparing handgun-carrying behavior with corresponding states ' laws , researchers found that proportionally fewer handgun owners carried a concealed handgun if they lived in a state whose laws afforded greater discretion to issuing agencies in the review of concealed-carry applications . Some owners nevertheless reported carrying a concealed handgun without a permit in states in which doing so was illegal .
State laws on handgun carrying have become less restrictive over the last 30 years . Many states that formerly gave local governing bodies the authority to review applications have moved to constrain local authorities ' discretion , thereby easing the permit process for adult residents .
In this same time period , the number of U.S. concealed-carry permit holders has increased significantly .
Rowhani-Rahbar said more research is needed to comprehensively evaluate the impact of increasingly permissive firearm-carry laws . Future studies should focus on analyzing how different concealed-carry laws influence carrying , and characterizing illegal carrying behavior among those who have been denied permits .
The study was funded by the Fund for a Safer Future and the Joyce Foundation .
IntelliMouse Explorer 3.0
IntelliMouse is a series of computer mice from Microsoft . The IntelliMouse series is credited with a number of innovations , [ 1 ] for example , Microsoft was among the first mouse vendors to introduce a scroll wheel , [ 2 ] an optical mouse , and dedicated auxiliary buttons on the side of the mouse . They use IntelliPoint drivers and its main competitor through the years has been Logitech .
History [ edit ]
The original IntelliMouse was introduced on July 22 , 1996 , with its stand-out feature being a scroll wheel . [ 3 ] Its design was based on that of the Microsoft Mouse 2.0 from 1993 .
In 1997 Microsoft made the IntelliMouse Trackball , a variant featuring a trackball . In May 1998 the IntelliMouse Pro was released , a redesign of the original IntelliMouse . [ 4 ]
The IntelliMouse Explorer was introduced on April 14 , 1999 , at COMDEX . This version featured IntelliEye optical tracking technology , eliminating the need for a mouse ball or mousepad . [ 5 ] It had five buttons ( two on top , a scroll wheel that could be depressed , and two on the left side of the mouse ) . [ 5 ] [ 6 ] It was asymmetrical and designed for right-handed users . [ 6 ] Microsoft called it the `` most radical computer mouse technology and design advancement '' since computer mice were introduced in the 1960s . [ 5 ] It was released on October 4 , 1999 . [ 7 ]
The IntelliMouse Optical was released in April 2000 . It had five buttons – two on top , the scroll wheel , and one on each side of the mouse . [ 6 ]
IntelliMouse Explorer 2.0 was introduced in 2003 , including a wireless variant called IntelliMouse Explorer for Bluetooth . The 3.0 version was also made that year but later discontinued , before being re-released in 2006 . [ 8 ]
On October 17 , 2017 , Microsoft revived the series with the new Classic IntelliMouse , featuring a new dark look based on the IntelliMouse Explorer 3.0 design and featuring BlueTrack technology , allowing it to be used on glass surfaces . [ 9 ] [ 10 ] [ 11 ]

Pictured : The 400-year-old map that shows China as the centre of the world
Advertisement
A rare 17th Century map that shows China as the centre of the world went on display yesterday in Washington .
The map , created in 1602 by Italian Jesuit missionary Matteo Ricci , was the first in Chinese to show the Americas , and identifies Florida as 'the Land of Flowers ' .
The 12ft by 5ft document , printed on six rolls of rice paper , is on show at the Library of Congress . It is one of only two copies in existence in good condition , and was coined 'the impossible black tulip of cartography ' by experts strugging to track it down .
Rare : The 17th Century Ricci Map . 1 : China - 2 : India - 3 : Russia - 4 : Europe - 5 : Japan - 6 : Canada - 7 : US - 8 : South America - 9 : Africa - 10 : Middle East
The map includes drawings and annotations detailing different regions of the world . Africa was noted to have the world 's highest mountain and longest river , while a brief description of North America describes 'humped oxen ' , wild horses and a region named 'Ka-na-ta ' .
Several Central and South American places are also named , including 'Wa-ti-ma-la ' ( Guatemala ) , 'Yu-ho-t'ang ' ( Yucatan ) and 'Chih-Li ' ( Chile ) .
Ricci also included a brief description of the discovery of the Americas : 'In olden days , nobody had ever known that there were such places as North and South America or Magellanica , ' they wrote , citing a name that early mapmakers used for Australia and Antarctica .
'But a hundred years ago , Europeans came sailing in their ships to parts of the sea coast , and so discovered them . '
Historic : The document , printed on six rolls of delicate rice paper , is one of only two copies in existence in good condition . It is on show alongside the Waldseemuller world map - the first to use the name 'America '
Ti Bin Zhang of the Chinese Embassy in Washington called the map a 'catalyst for commerce ' , and that it represented the momentous first meeting of East and West .
Ricci was among the first Westerners to live in what is now Beijing . Known for introducing Western science to China , Ricci created the map at the request of Emperor Wanli .
No examples of the map are known to exist in China , where Ricci was revered and buried . Only a few original copies are known to exist , held by the Vatican 's libraries and collectors in France and Japan .
Catalyst for commerce : The map is thought to represent the momentous first meeting of East and West
The copy on display at the Library of Congress became the second most expensive rare map ever sold after it was purchased by the James Ford Bell Trust in October for $ 1million .
The trust also owns the Waldseemuller world map , which was the first to use the name 'America ' and was purchased for a staggering $ 10 million in 2003 .
Prior to its sale , the Ricci map had been held by a private collector in Japan . When the Washington exhibition ends in April , it will be housed at the Bell Library at the University of Minnesota .
Less than a week before Election Day , Daily Beast writer Andrew Sullivan laid out a strong-worded case for why they believe President Obama deserves a second term , and why the president 's first term should not be considered a “ failure. ” At one point , Sullivan reprimanded those who voted for Obama 's first term but are hesitant to do so again .
“ I have no idea what standard people are using to declare Obama 's first term a failure , ” they wrote . “ To save us from a Great Depression , rescue the auto industry , re-regulate Wall Street , decimate al Qaeda , kill bin Laden and Qaddafi and provide universal healthcare ? That 's failure ?
Sullivan explains that “ Unemployment is lower now than it was when they took office , and moving downward , ” referring to the Labor Department 's September report that showed a 7.8 % jobless rate . Many conservatives , however , attacked those numbers as “ dubious ” and possibly “ manipulated ” by the administration for political gain .
“ I understand why the Tea Party disagrees with their policies . What I can not understand is how those who voted for them in 2008 because they wanted real change can explain why they may vote against them now . It makes no sense , ” they wrote . “ He has carried through almost every election promise , and those they have n't can mostly be attributed to the GOP House . ”
They added : “ If you voted for Obama in 2008 and do n't in 2012 , you never really voted for them in 2008 . They told us it would take two terms . ”
If Romney were to win the election and Obama is stripped of a second term , Sullivan predicted : “ Back to ballooning , rather than shrinking deficits , millions left without access to private health insurance , a guaranteed war against Iran , climate change policy handed over to the oil and coal companies , and massive spending on defense we do n't need . Not to mention torture . ”

“ You can control the system and all the incentives for people to watch movies , but at the end of the day they are going to watch what they want to watch , ” said Kevin Lee , vice president for programming at dGenerate Films , a distributor of independent movies from China , most of which are never seen at mainland theaters .
The government also wields a heavy hand over domestic productions and imports , tinkering with scripts , censoring content and barring entire genres . Recent regulations include bans on scenes depicting excessive drinking and smoking and plots that denigrate revolutionary heroes and government officials . Another guideline warned television producers to steer clear of dramas employing time travel . Such shows , the State Administration said , “ casually make up myths , have monstrous and weird plots , use absurd tactics , and even promote feudalism , superstition , fatalism and reincarnation . ”

In two dozen recent interviews at theaters around the capital , some patrons said they were pleased that domestic films were beginning to adopt Hollywood production values . But younger viewers , especially those who have grown up downloading American sitcoms and films — nearly all of them illicitly — increasingly demand the technical wizardry and narrative complexity that they say is often lacking in state-backed productions .
“ Unlike domestic films , foreign ones often have layers of plots , ” Wang Tong , 14 , said earlier this week as they waited to see the Hong Kong thriller “ Mysterious Island ” at a theater not far from Tiananmen Square .
That 's not to suggest that Chinese filmmakers are short on creativity . A number of recent box-office successes , including “ Let the Bullets Fly , ” an action comedy set in the 1920s , and “ City of Life and Death , ” a period drama about Japanese war atrocities in Nanjing , have also been well received critically . And a growing number of sophisticated art-house dramas and documentaries have been made without government backing , though such films are often banned from Chinese theaters and rarely make it beyond the international festival circuit .
Then there are films like “ Beginning of the Great Revival , ” the state-backed extravaganza that features over 100 stars but has been panned by many of those who have seen it . The production has earned $ 46 million during its first three weeks , according to the state-run Xinhua news agency . But with state-owned enterprises buying up large blocks of tickets , the film 's popularity has been questioned .
Despite adamant denials by a co-director , Huang Jianxin , many audiences seem to believe one prevailing rumor : that foreign blockbusters will be delayed until “ Great Revival ” receipts surpass $ 120 million . Such suspicions are reinforced by a couple of undeniable truths : “ Transformers : Dark of the Moon ” will not reach China until Thursday , three weeks behind the United States premiere , while “ Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows : Part 2 ” is not scheduled to land here until Aug. 4 .
In the wake of the lacerated Achilles Tendon suffered by Ottawa Senators star defenseman Erik Karlsson on Wednesday night , has risen a revitalized discourse about measures NHL players can take to avoid a similar fate .
Namely , wearing socks and shirts made out of kevlar .
Anaheim Ducks star Teemu Selanne is one of the biggest supporters of wearing kevlar fashioned material , as they suffered the same injury as Karlsson while playing for the Winnipeg Jets during the 1994 season . Labeling the decision not to wear the material as `` stupid , '' Selanne wears kevlar socks as well as kevlar sleeves to protect their wrists .
Following practice at Joe Louis Arena on Thursday , Selanne demonstrated during their media availability how effective kevlar material is against skate blades , via Ansar Kahn of MLive.com :
Sitting in the visitors dressing room at Joe Louis Arena Thursday , Teemu Selanne slipped on a Kevlar sleeve , grabbed their skate and attempted to slice their wrist . `` This does n't cut , '' Selanne , the Anaheim Ducks star forward , said . `` The socks , same thing . I do n't understand why they are not ( mandatory ) . It 's so light , does n't bother you at all . ''
In the Red Wings locker room , players like Daniel Cleary , Jonathan Ericsson , Mikael Samuelsson and Niklas Kronwall all discussed the benefits of wearing kevlar . Cleary acknowledged how drastic the outcome of a freak accident could be if a player is wearing the protection :
`` Instead of a severed tendon , you 'd probably get some stitches . It 's like a bullet-proof vest ; it 's going to hurt and probably leave a mark , just not as deep . ''
In Carolina , more than half of the Hurricanes roster uses some kind of kevlar material because of past occurrences where Joe Corvo , Chad LaRose and Cam Ward suffered cuts .
Hurricanes senior director of communications Mike Sundheim told Tim Wharnsby that no member of the team has suffered a cut since using the material . Sundheim believes more players will wear the material in the wake of the Karlsson incident and shared a story from the team 's equipment manager , via CBC.ca :
`` Our equipment guy did tell a story where one of our guys , they thought it was Justin Faulk , was struck in the leg while wearing these ( kevlar ) last year , '' Sundheim said . `` He said you could see the mark on the sock where they were hit , but they were not injured . ''
In Vancouver , Canucks players entered the locker room on Thursday morning to find a pair of Kevlar socks laid out in each player 's locker . Defenseman Kevin Bieksa has been wearing kevlar socks for five years since having their achilles cut during a game in 2007 .
They also believe all players should be wearing them , via the National Post :
`` We have done some tests with [ the socks material ] and taken the X-Acto knife to it and scissors , and it does n't go all the way through , '' they said . `` So I do n't know why you would n't wear them . ''
Discussions about using kevlar based material has also come up with the New Jersey Devils and Washington Capitals , as Devils coach Pete DeBoer is thinking about talking to their players about it and Washington players such as Alex Ovechkin , Eric Fehr and Jay Beagle already wear kevlar socks .
However , much like with visors on helmets or guards on skates , the decision to use the protection is up to individual players .
While a piece of equipment could better protect the players , it might also cause them some discomfort during play . This is commonly the explanation given by players who choose not to wear visors , skate guards or the kevlar material .
Ultimately , players need to evaluate whether a bit of initial discomfort while adjusting to a piece of equipment is worse than the risk of serious injury .
With Karlsson projected to miss approximately six months while recovering , adjusting to a sock might not be such a bad option in the larger scheme of things .
Consumers can buy on for $ 399 , which is expected to ship March 2017

ELECTRIC SCOOTERS BANNED IN CHINESE CITIES Beijing and Shanghai , China 's two largest cities , have banned residents from using electric scooters and Segways on roads amid safety concerns this past August . Traffic authorities in Beijing said violators will be fined 10 Yuan ( £1 ) starting on August 29 ; while the Shanghai police launched a crackdown last week on the popular modes of transport , reported the People 's Daily Online . Electric scooters and Segways are getting increasingly popular among residents in large Chinese cities as a way to cope with traffic congestion . The ban applies to two-wheeled scooters as well as one-wheeled self-balancing scooters . Anyone who disobeys the law can be fined up to 50 Yuan ( £5.7 ) . According to Beijing Daily , the city 's consumers association had tested more than 20 brands of electric scooters and found most of their brakes did not meet the national standard of safety . The test discovered that the braking distance of the electric scooters could be as far as 9.9 meters ( 32 feet ) . Only one brand could come to a full stop in less than four meters ( 13 feet ) , which is the Chinese national standard . In terms of Segways , they could take as long as nine seconds to stop after the riders lean backwards to slow down .
And it would n't be deemed a smart scooter if you had to use your hands to control everything .
The horn , cruise-control , headlight buttons and brakes are controlled by your thumbs that are firmly positioned on the handlebars .
This feature is also linked the smartphone mount in the center of the handlebars , which lets riders take pictures and videos without using their hands .
The system includes an accompanied app that lets riders use their smartphone as a wireless key for the scooter and customize the horn and lights using the technology .
The team at Immotor Go also notes that they will 'continue to work on future upgrades utilizing Immotor GO built-in sensors , accelerators and other hardware capabilities , so you can expect future improvements down the road ' .

Unmanned aerial vehicles ( UAVs ) are the new face of warfare for the US and many of the world 's biggest defence spenders . But where are they based around the world ?
Yesterday we published a complete database of reported drone attacks in Pakistan , Somalia and Yemen , as a senior diplomat criticised their use . But it may be too late . Drones are everywhere .
Data from the International Institute for Strategic Studies , which it has allowed us to re-publish here on the Datablog , identifies 56 different types of UAVs used in 11 different countries . Where it can calculate actual stocks , this covers 807 drones in active service around the world - and this is a huge underestimate : number data is not available for China , Turkey and Russia .
The US is the most open about its drone stocks . The IISS data shows that is has at least 678 drones in service , of 18 different types . Some 14 of them are identified as 'heavy ' , and includes UAVs such as the MQ-1B Predator , of which it has over 100 .
As for the UK , the army has unknown stocks of the Hermes 450 and
Watchkeeper drones , while the RAF has at least 10 MQ-9 Reaper heavy drones .
The full data is below . What can you do with it ?

As legislation to fast-track congressional approval of the Trans-Pacific Partnership gets ready to finally make its debut in Congress this week , a top Democratic member of the House announced they would oppose the bill . Ad Policy
Representative Chris Van Hollen , the ranking member of the House Budget Committee , wrote in a letter to Representative Sandy Levin , the ranking member of the House Ways & Means Committee , that they would oppose fast-track authority , also known as Trade Promotion Authority or TPA . The letter was obtained by The Nation and its authenticity was confirmed by an aide to Van Hollen .
Van Hollen opposed a previous iteration of fast-track legislation last year , as did most other top Democrats , including Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi . But so far , many of those Democrats ( including Van Hollen ) had not yet announced a position on the new TPA legislation being hammered out by Senators Ron Wyden , Orrin Hatch , and Representative Paul Ryan . ( Levin opted out of those talks , and believes Congress should see at least the outline of a trade deal before taking up legislation to fast-track its approval . ) Pelosi still remains publicly undecided .
If Van Hollen—a visible member of the Democratic caucus and ranking member of a major committee—ultimately supported the Wyden-Hatch-Ryan bill , it would have been a signal that House Democrats were ready to go along with the Obama administration 's trade agenda . But in their letter , Van Hollen wrote “ it is clear that many [ of my concerns ] will not be included in a revised TPA . ”
While the legislation remains behind closed doors for now , Van Hollen said continuing public opposition from Republicans made it clear that the TPA legislation would n't include additional currency , labor , and environmental provisions . Moreover , they wrote that since TPA was being unveiled so close to the conclusion of the overall trade talks , “ it is clearly too late for TPA to have any meaningful impact on the shape of TPP negotiations . ”
Like virtually all Democrats , Van Hollen cited concerns that enforceable currency manipulation obligations would not be included in the trade deal .
They also said they object to further entrenching the investor-state dispute settlement process , which according to negotiating documents leaked last month by Wikileaks will be included in the TPP deal . Those provisions set up a process of international tribunals where foreign companies can challenge regulatory actions by sovereign governments , and seek financial damages for any lost profit as a result of regulation . Van Hollen wrote that “ a TPP that allows for increased investor lawsuits could undermine a government 's right to regulate in the public interest and involve the US in costly and detrimental lawsuits covered by American taxpayers . ”
Van Hollen further cited concerns over labor standards in some of the signatory countries , particularly Vietnam , and said they insist on an agreement that includes “ strong and enforceable labor protections as well as an action plan to ensure that countries are complying with internationally recognized labor rights . ”
The next several days will be crucial for the fate of TPA . Many Democrats have so far remained neutral or muted on the ongoing talks , but as the legislation finally proceeds towards a vote , several leading and visible Democrats like Van Hollen will start to take positions . Activists were heartened that Van Hollen dropped an early marker in the fight . “ This letter lists some good reasons why fast track is in trouble—including investor lawsuits , currency manipulation , and workers rights—but this will come down to the growing realization that fast track will make it easier to send American jobs overseas , ” said Jason Stanford of the Coalition to Stop Fast Track .
Wyden 's office did not immediately return a request for comment . Van Hollen 's letter can be seen here :

Take Action : Demand that Congress Reject TPP Fast Track
When Melissa Lee saw all the people coming forward about sexual abuse in recent months , they knew that they had something they needed to contribute to the conversation . Lee is a first-time author who lives in Essex , Connecticut . Them new book is Journey to the Inner Child Workbook : Meditations , Art Therapy , Journaling and Other Techniques . In the book they share their process of recovering from sexual abuse in their childhood .
They recently joined News Director Dan Katz to talk about the book . Below is a transcript of their conversation .
Melissa , thanks for being with us .
Thank you , Dan , I really appreciate this opportunity .
The book is literally a workbook to help people reconnect with their inner child . It 's full of questions , prompts , and activities to do that . First for our listeners , how do you define the inner child ?
I think one of the most powerful experiences a person will ever have is meeting their inner child . And the reason for that is because in our childhood often , we have woundings and woundings where pain is creating , and those woundings ... if we do n't deal with that and repress that , as adults it 's gon na come up in patterns in our life that are really unhealthy . Addictions , physical symptoms . Any kind of pain that has n't been addressed will come up in all those ways .
So I think going into dealing with your inner child is the only way to heal these woundings that are coming out even now in our modern life with all of the media attention around some of these men who have perpetrated against some of these women . And you know , with the sexual harassment . I think a lot of those issues are directly related to unresolved childhood repressed abuse . And until we as individuals do this inner child work , we will continue to embody our childhood traumas as adults and act them out together .
Can you take us through the kind of activities that are in the workbook to help people reconnect with their inner child ?
Yeah , one of the most important ones that I believe you should do right away is got a picture of yourself as a child , and every day connect with that inner child by looking into the eyes of the inner child . And start connecting through looking at the energy of what you seem like in the picture , like , look at your eyes , do they seem sad ? Do they seem like they 're in shock ? So by doing that daily , that 's going to bring you right back to your ... the child that you were growing up .
And by doing that you 're going to start to possibly have memories that have been repressed , and emotions come forward into your conscious mind from your unconscious mind . And that is so pertinent because that 's gon na show where your pain comes from .
And there are exercises in this book , if you want to do art exercises , there 's a whole section in the book that guides you through these exercises using art to connect with your inner child . And if you 're having a physical issue , I have a whole section on what you should do with getting in contact with those physical symptoms that are coming up , and that can also be a doorway down into your pain and some probably unconscious traumas from your childhood .
Now this book is based on your own healing process . And it was really later in life that you decided to go on this journey to connect with your inner child . What prompted you to do this ?
Panic attacks and physical issues that I was having that no doctor , therapist , healer could help me with . It was this prompting of my own inward journey . Except for one person in Santa Fe , New Mexico , a doctor helped me kind of hold the space for me to really give me the confidence that what I was getting in touch with as far as the inner child was real and some of the memories that were coming up were actually real also .
You lived in Connecticut , Newtown , in a nice place with animals and family ...
Uh-huh . I had a wonderful , beautiful life .
But you felt you needed to go on this journey , and that took you to Santa Fe .
That took me to Santa Fe , yeah . It was really quite an inward journey for me to let go of my life I had here in Connecticut for 17 years and go to Santa Fe to heal some of those childhood wounds .
So , you 've been doing this work for more than a decade on yourself . How is your relationship with your inner child today ?
Well , so much more intact now I would say because I have every single day of my life for twelve years been in touch with my inner child . And basically , have made this my life 's work . So , I have so much more joy in my life , and acceptance of who I am .
Because what happens , Dan , when you do n't deal with childhood trauma and abuse is that we have these beliefs about ourselves that are actually false beliefs and are usually around our own self-worth . And if we do n't deal with that , than we sort of embody that in the victim/perpetrator roles .
And so for me , I was severely abused as a child , had repressed it , did n't come into the knowledge of that until my late 30s , and so I was acting out a victim role all the time with people in my life . And until I did this work , it was really entrenched in my life . Now it 's very , very few circumstances where I 'm embodying being a victim , and I have come into my power doing this work .
What advice do you have for people who are starting to come forward with their stories that they 've held down for so many years ?
I would say believe all of the emotions you 're getting . So that is my advice . Do not discount it as a figment of your imagination , because it 's not . And so , I would say seek someone who has done the work . Seek a therapist or a healer who has done their own work , who has delved deeply into their own pain and knows how to guide and guide you through your own . ‘ Cause that 's really the most important , is owning your own pain and knowing how to do that with another individual . And so that 's the advice that I would give them .
As somebody who 's gone through the book and has done all the activities I can tell you , doing the Inner Child work has changed the way that I look at life and the way I interact with other people . Thank you , Melissa , for coming in today and sharing your story with everybody .
You 're welcome , Dan . I would like to give 100 free books to the first 100 people that get onto my website and leave their information so that I can send them a book .

Those living on Vancouver 's west side are several times more likely to sign up to be an organ donor than those living in East Vancouver , according to data from B.C . 's organ donor registry .
At The Vancouver Sun 's request , BC Transplant provided data on the number of people on its registry in every postal code area of the province . The Sun then compared that against population figures from the most recent census .
The data shows that , overall , about one in five B.C . residents are on the registry . But rates vary greatly depending on where you live .
In some neighbourhoods on Vancouver 's west side , such as Kitsilano ( V6K ) and Point Grey ( V6R ) , a third or more of residents are on the organ donor registry . Rates are also high in the downtown Victoria neighbourhoods of V8S and V8V .
In contrast , in some areas of East Vancouver — including South Vancouver ( V5X ) and Collingwood ( V5R ) — just seven per cent of residents has signed up to be an organ donor .
Registry rates are also below 10 per cent in parts of Richmond ( V6X , V6Y ) and north Surrey ( V4N , V3V ) .

BC Transplant does n't ask people 's ethnicity or income when they register . However , an analysis by The Sun found that , generally speaking , higher-income neighbourhoods have higher organ donor registry rates while those with a large share of immigrants have lower rates .
Amber Appleby , provincial operations director for BC Transplant , said the agency could n't say why some groups may be more likely to sign up than others .
“ It 's a good question , ” they said . “ I do n't know how much research has been done in that regard . ”
However , Appleby said BC Transplant has made a concerted effort in recent years to reach out to immigrant communities , including having its volunteers attend various ethnic festivals and translating its outreach materials into Punjabi and Chinese .
“ There has been specific outreach with various ethnic groups but it may just be that it 's not reaching those people , ” they said .
In addition to providing registry figures by postal code area , BC Transplant also provided The Sun with data by age and gender .
That data shows that 24 per cent of B.C . women are on the organ donor registry , compared to just 18 per cent of B.C . men .
Appleby said there 's plenty of evidence that women volunteer more often than men and signing up for the registry may just be another example of “ the role of women as caregivers . ”
The other possibility , they said , is that women are confronted with the choice to register more often ; for example , when they open their child 's birth registration package and see an organ donor brochure tucked inside .
BC Transplant 's data also shows that younger British Columbians are more likely to sign up as donors than older ones .
Thirty per cent of those aged 20 to 29 are on B.C . 's organ donor registry , compared to just 20 per cent of those in their 50s .
If you 're on a mobile device , please click here to see the chart .
Appleby said BC Transplant has made a conscious effort to encourage young people to sign up as donors through events at high schools , hoping that students will encourage the rest of their family to follow suit .
“ If you talk about it in schools , they 're going to impact their friends , they 're going to bring their parents into the discussion , ” they said .
Social media has also played a role in motivating young people , said Appleby .
New Westminster resident Eva Markvoort , who struggled publicly with cystic fibrosis and a double lung transplant , helped lead a successful campaign to encourage British Columbians to sign up as organ donors before their death in 2010 .
Facebook has also boosted interest among young people by allowing users to indicate on their profile that they 're a registered organ donor .
B.C . residents can check to see if they 're on the organ donor registry by entering their Care Card number at transplant.bc.ca . If they 're not already registered , they can sign up online at the same place .
Paper registration forms are also sent out by BC Transplant along with new driver 's licenses and Care Cards .
In some jurisdictions , like the state of Michigan , people are explicitly asked if they want to be an organ donor when they renew their driver 's license .
That 's not the case in B.C. , said Appleby , although the agency is in discussions with the B.C . government to see if there 's a way to make registration part of signing up for the new BC Services Card .
“ That 's something we 're going to be moving forward with fairly soon , ” they said . “ But it ca n't increase the transaction time at the counter . ”
BC Transplant wants to make it easier for people to join the registry , said Appleby . But it also wants to ensure that people are giving informed consent and are n't pressured to sign up if they do n't really want to .
While BC Transplant encourages people to be on the registry , it 's not the final word on whether someone actually becomes an organ donor .
Regardless of whether someone is on the registry or not , the family of a potential donor will still be asked if they want their loved one 's organs to be donated .
Indeed , of the 458 deceased organ donors in B.C . during the past decade , three-quarters were not on the registry at the time of their death .
“ The bottom line is , really , the decision-making for organ donation is made at bedside , ” said Dr. Jagbir Gill , a transplant doctor at St. Paul 's Hospital . “ It 's really next of kin making the decision without any documented knowledge up front . ”
Similarly , if someone is on the registry but their spouse objects , the surgery will not go ahead .
“ If that person says , ‘ No , they did n't really mean that , their views have changed , ' — no , we would never proceed , ” said Appleby .
The registry still serves an important role , though , in clarifying people 's wishes .
“ The importance of the registry is you and your family are making a decision while you 're calm and in a rational state , ” said Appleby . “ And it takes the pressure off the family from making that decision for you . ”
The data provided by BC Transplant only included total registry counts by postal code area , gender and age . It did not contain personal information about individuals .
While the vast majority of people on the organ donor registry want to be donors , people can also register their wish not to , something fewer than one per cent of those on the registry have done .

An Interim Budget is not the same as a 'Vote on Account ' . While a 'Vote on Account ' deals only with the expenditure side of the government 's budget , an Interim Budget is a complete set of accounts , including both expenditure and receipts . An Interim Budget gives the complete financial statement , very similar to a full Budget . While the law does not debar the Union government from introducing tax changes , normally during an election year , successive governments have avoided making any major changes in income tax laws during an Interim Budget . [ 2 ]
The Union Budget of India , also referred to as the Annual Financial Statement in the Article 112 of the Constitution of India , [ 1 ] is the annual budget of the Republic of India . The Government presents it on the first day of February so that it could be materialized before the commencement of new financial year in April . Till 2016 it was presented on the last working day of February by the Finance Minister of India in Parliament . The budget , which is presented by means of the Finance bill and the Appropriation bill has to be passed by Lok Sabha before it can come into effect from April 1 , the start of India 's financial year .
The first Union budget of independent India was presented by R. K. Shanmukham Chetty on November 26 , 1947 .
The Union budgets for the fiscal years 1959-61 to 1963-64 , inclusive of the interim budget for 1962-63 , were presented by Morarji Desai.On February 29 in 1964 and 1968 , they became the only finance minister to present the Union budget on their birthday . [ 4 ] Desai presented budgets that included five annual budgets and an interim budget during their first stint and three final budgets and one interim budget in their second tenure when they were both the Finance Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister of India .
After Desai 's resignation , Indira Gandhi , the then Prime Minister of India , took over the Ministry of Finance to become the only woman to hold the post of the Finance Minister .
Pranab Mukherjee , the first Rajya Sabha member to hold the Finance portfolio , presented the annual budgets for the financial years 1982-83 , 1983–84 and 1984-85 .

Rand Paul 's campaign is unloading on ABC News over new rules that would likely exclude him—and several other Republican candidates—from a crucial debate on the eve of the New Hampshire primary .
The network announced that its Feb. 6 debate in Manchester will be limited to candidates who poll in the top six nationally or in New Hampshire—but only the top three finishers in the Iowa caucuses . That approach would eliminate the undercard debate .
“ It 's a little bit irresponsible , ” Paul spokesperson Sergio Gor said in an interview in Iowa , before the Fox News/Google debate Thursday night . “ Voters should be the ones making these decisions and not network executives in New York . ”
Gor said they are appealing to ABC and also pressing their case with the Republican National Committee , which oversees the debates .
Paul boycotted the Fox Business debate in South Carolina when they were relegated to the undercard , but their showing in the Iowa polls landed them a spot on the main stage tonight .
In recent debates hosted by Fox News , Fox Business and CNN , a top-six finish in polls in Iowa ( as well as New Hampshire and nationally ) was enough to earn a ticket to the prime-time stage . Under ABC 's approach , Paul , Carly Fiorina , Mike Huckabee and Rick Santorum would likely be excluded , based on current polling , from the debate moderated by David Muir .
“ It 's unfortunate because you 're discounting anything that happened in Iowa , ” Gor said . “ They 're dismissing the importance of the early states . Are they really going to exclude the fourth-place finisher in Iowa ? We 're hoping they reconsider . ”
The Paul campaign has something of a history with ABC based on objections to the role of George Stephanopoulos , the former Clinton White House official who is the co-anchor of “ Good Morning America ” and hosts “ This Week. ” The Kentucky senator has avoided interviews with Stephanopoulos , saying last year , “ We 've made the decision that he 's too close to the Clintons to really give an objective interview . ”
Stephanopoulos withdrew from any role in the GOP debates after apologizing for their failure to disclose $ 75,000 in donations to the Clinton Foundation .

Bill Gates has high hopes for digital currency as an important banking tool for the poor . But Bitcoin is n't one of those currencies , they said in a Reddit AMA today . At least not in its current form .
Gates extolled the value of digital currency in their AMA last year as well , explaining that since many poor people in developing countries do n't have access to traditional banking , it 's not financially worth it for banks to put branches in areas where the amounts stored and transferred are so small , leaving the poor at a huge disadvantage when it comes to exchanging , saving , and accessing money .

Mobile banking costs almost nothing to process , so it actually is worthwhile for banks to provide the service . That means digital money offers an opportunity for mobile banking , and hence the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation is so gung-ho about giving people more ways to store their money .
So why not Bitcoin ? The billionaire philanthropist and redditor called it `` an exciting new technology '' in today 's AMA , but they do n't think it 's a very good tool to make banking easier in emerging markets because it 's so volatile and because it 's anonymous :
We do n't use bitcoin specifically for two reasons . One is that the poor should n't have a currency whose value goes up and down a lot compared to their local currency . Second is that if a mistake is made in who you pay then you need to be able to reverse it so anonymity would n't work .

Bitcoin has been touted as a potentially revolutionary banking tool for the poor , and it 's likely Gates ' remarks will rankle the community . But they did offer an alternative , highlighting the uses of local digital currency like Kenya 's M-Pesa over anonymous cryptocurrencies :
Byford has told council and the city 's auditor general that the memo was not prepared at the request of either Mayor John Tory or TTC Chair Josh Colle , and that it was instead initiated by transit agency staff to prepare TTC executives for questions on an important debate . An auditor general 's report on the briefing note released in October reached the same conclusion .
New evidence obtained by the Star shows outgoing TTC CEO Andy Byford privately contradicted their own public statements about the origins of a controversial briefing note that played a crucial role in a council vote on the Scarborough subway extension last year .
Matlow provided the text message to the Star this week after Byford , in what appears to be an unprecedented step for the head of a city agency , filed a complaint against the councillor with the city 's integrity commissioner .
However , a text Byford sent Councillor Josh Matlow ahead of that July 2016 council meeting states the opposite . In response to a question from Matlow about the document , Byford wrote : “ We have prepared a ( briefing note ) at the chair 's request and for the mayor 's office . ”
Byford cited the auditor general 's report , which concluded there was “ no evidence of . . . staff being pressured by elected officials ” in the preparation of the memo , or of any “ lack of integrity ” on Byford 's part .
“ What did happen is we provided it to the chair , and to the mayor , because obviously they needed to know that this was a subject that I was going to talk about . ”
“ There was no direction by elected officials to create the briefing note , nor was there direction to change or amend its contents . Full stop , ” Byford said .
In an interview Wednesday , Byford , at times reading from a prepared statement , did n't refute that they had sent the text or dispute its contents , but claimed the message was “ consistent ” with their earlier statements on the origin of the briefing note .
As the Star has previously reported , the TTC provided the note directly to Tory 's and Colle 's offices , despite city policy that says information from staff should be circulated equally to all council . The mayor 's office then leaked it to CP24 and used it to convince councillors concerned about the subway 's rising costs that the LRT was not a better option .
The briefing note was prepared in June 2016 , days after the public learned the cost to build a one-stop subway extension to the Scarborough Town Centre had ballooned by $ 1 billion . The document cast significant doubt that a return to an alternative light rail transit ( LRT ) plan was possible and , significantly , relied on incorrect assumptions to conclude the cost of the LRT had also risen to nearly match that of a subway .
“ I did n't share this text with a soul until a complaint was submitted against me and therefore it was necessary to respond and to demonstrate why I held the beliefs I have , ” said Matlow , who was interviewed by auditor general Beverly Romeo-Beehler . Matlow said when they were speaking to the auditor general they had “ no reason to expect that Mr. Byford would make contradictory remarks ” about the origin of the note .
But the report did n't address the text message because the auditor general did n't have it .
Matlow asked Byford directly about political involvement in the briefing note on the floor of council in November , during a debate of the auditor general 's investigation .
“ Who initiated the briefing note ? ” Matlow asked .
“ It was Joan Taylor , who is my chief of staff , doing their job , councillor , ” Byford replied .
Matlow : “ And with all due respect , has that consistently been your position when you 've been asked this same question ? ”
Byford said they had been “ crystal clear from the start who initiated the briefing note . ”
Matlow went further : “ Did the chair 's office or the mayor 's office have anything to do with initiating the briefing note ? ”
Byford was firm : “ No . ”
“ Not at all ? ”
“ No . ”
Matlow said this week those comments are clearly contradicted by the text Byford sent .
Byford , who is leaving the TTC this month to take the top post at the New York Transit Authority , filed their complaint against Matlow on Nov. 13 , days after the tense exchange at council .
According to a copy of the complaint obtained by the Star , the TTC chief alleges Matlow contravened the section of council 's code of conduct that prohibits members from disparaging city staff .
“ On numerous occasions , councillor Matlow has publicly questioned my integrity and honesty and that of my staff on this issue , ” they wrote in their complaint . As one example , they cited Matlow stating on the floor of council that they did not believe the briefing note was initiated by transit agency staff without political involvement .
“ The reason I do n't believe that that 's true is because Andy Byford told me it was n't , ” Matlow told the Star in an interview .
“ I asked Andy Byford if there was any political involvement in initiating the briefing note . I asked them if they can verify that he 's been consistent with their response about the briefing note and in both cases what they told the auditor general and city council was different to what they told me months before . And there 's one thing for certain : There 's no way that both stories that they told were true . ”
Matlow also told the Star in an interview that Byford confessed to them during a private meeting — walking through Rosehill Reservoir last summer shortly before the briefing note was leaked — that municipal staff were being directed by the mayor 's office on how they could respond to councillors ' questions about the subway , specifically that they should call it an “ express subway ” because it made the plan sound better , and that the CEO had “ never felt more politicized in their life . ”
Byford did not deny the conversation with Matlow took place . They said they have met privately with Matlow , who happens to be their local councillor , numerous times , and had “ always been frank and open with them in an attempt to communicate the realities of operating the TTC . ”
However , they stated , “ I have never been directed to say or do anything by any elected official that would in any way compromise my professionalism or integrity . I deny flatly any suggestion to the contrary . ”
Colle told the Star they never asked for the briefing note and did not know why Byford had said that in a text .
“ I am certainly sitting down with them to ask them that , ” they said .
The mayor 's spokesperson , Don Peat , did not specifically respond to questions sent by the Star about whether their knowledge of a briefing note had been requested by the chair , or whether the mayor 's office is directing the advice public servants give to councillors .
Matlow texted Byford on July 4 , 2016 at 9:03 a.m. asking them to call because they wanted to ask about the briefing note being reported on in an online story posted to CP24 's website , although it had not been circulated to other councillors .
According to sources , the note was leaked by the mayor 's office to CP24 . That was after it was provided exclusively to Tory 's and Colle 's offices on June 29 last year , according to emails earlier obtained by the Star . Colle appeared on a noon talk show .
After the Star published a story on the briefing note 's influence , a citizen group of transit advocates complained to the city 's watchdogs , claiming Byford had deliberately misled council . The auditor general assumed responsibility for an investigation .
Romeo-Beehler 's investigation did not touch on all aspects of the briefing note . It made no mention of the note being leaked to CP24 .
It also did not look at the statements the note made that cast doubt on whether the LRT was still feasible , such as that it may no longer fit in the corridor even though the Star was able to verify that it did by simply asking Metrolinx , the provincial transit agency that would have been responsible for building the line .
It 's not clear why the briefing note did not clarify those things despite the TTC saying they sent the note to Metrolinx for review .
The dispute over the briefing note has turned bitter for both Matlow and Byford . Earlier this week , the TTC CEO said allegations they had misled council had “ wounded me terribly ” and described the accusations , which they adamantly refute , as “ probably the low point of my TTC career . ”
Byford also told the Star they were “ appalled ” that details of their complaint to the integrity commissioner had been leaked to the media , and warned it could have a “ chilling effect ” against civil servants who wish to protect themselves from accusations of wrongdoing . They charged that “ the integrity of that ( complaint ) process has been compromised . ”
“ I 've got nothing to lose in any of this , except for my reputation , which I hold dear . As such , I will continue to protect it without fear or favour , and that 's why I submitted the complaint . ”
Matlow said they had “ great reservation ” about sharing the text and information Byford told them privately , saying they did not do so lightly .
But facing a complaint and with members of council accusing them of impugning the reputation of staff while challenging their own integrity , they felt they needed to explain why they could n't apologize and what had informed their beliefs .
“ All of us , no matter what our views are , no matter what our objectives are , should be able to rely on staff to provide objective , independent and balanced information that informs us to be able to make a good decision on public policy and so I stand by the concerns that I raise . ”
The chief executive of Goldman Sachs is criticizing President Trump 's executive order on immigration .
Lloyd Blankfein , the Wall Street giant 's CEO , told firm employees Sunday that the company does not support Trump 's policy and said it does not mesh with the company 's principles .
“ This is not a policy we support , and I would note that it has already been challenged in federal court , ” they said in a voicemail to employees , as reported by Business Insider .
“ If the order were to become or remain effective , I recognize that there is potential for disruption to the firm , and especially to some of our people and their families , '' they said . `` I want to assure all of you that we will work to minimize such disruption to the extent we can within the law and are focused on supporting our colleagues and their families who may be affected . ”

Blankfein 's criticism is particularly noteworthy because the Trump administration has relied heavily on talent from Goldman Sachs to fill out spots at the top of its organization .
Trump 's Treasury secretary nominee , Steven Mnuchin , and top economic adviser , Gary Cohn , both spent years at Goldman . So did Steven Bannon , one of Trump 's closest advisers , and Anthony Scaramucci , another member of Trump 's inner circle .
Cohn , who was president and chief executive officer at Goldman before joining the Trump White House as director of the National Economic Council , worked closely with Blankfein at the top of the firm .

The Saudi Arabia coalition led initiative in Yemen on Friday focused on Houthi local army movements and ballistic rocket platforms as well different positions of the Iranian-backed rebels over the north and south of the nation , a military representative said on Friday .
“ Operation Decisive Storm , ” led by Saudi and a coalition of Middle East countries allies against Iranian-supported Houthi volunteer armies who are endeavoring to remove Yemen 's universally recognized government , had completed its second day .

Saudi warplanes focused on Houthi positions in both south and north of the Yemeni nation , with an emphasis on Houthi powers attempting to convey along the Yemen-Saudi border , the state-run Saudi Press Agency reported representative of the Saudi-led coalition forces Brigadier General Ahmed Asiri as saying .
Coalition military forces likewise focused on all air defensive positions , including surface-to-air rockets systems , anti-aircrafts artillery and ballistic missiles platforms , the spokesperson added .
Moreover , coalition fighter jets focused on the Houthi-controlled al-Anad airbase outside of the southern port city of Aden , the last main stronghold of Yemeni President Abdrabbu Mansour Hadi 's government .
A bridge seriously utilized by the Houthi local militias to transport supplies and convenient ballistic rockets was likewise focused on , unveiling that the Houthi local armies were attempting to move their fortifications between the northern Saada Province towards the capital Sanaa .
The Saudi-drove coalition had kept up complete air amazingness , making Houthi powers powerless and permitting all developments on the ground to be checked day and night , said the representative .
UAE aviation based armed forces planes had likewise completed a mission over Yemen on Friday , the representative said . The Saudi-led coalition had maintained complete air supremacy , making Houthi forces vulnerable and allowing all movements on the ground to be monitored around the clock .
Because of the substantial volume of air strikes , the representative encouraged Yemeni regular civilians to avoid the wide array of Houthi targets , including local army focuses , guards and logistics vehicles over the north and south of the country , including that Houthi fighters may endeavor to utilize people as human shields .
The operation would proceed until it accomplishes its military objectives – specifically the disjoining of Houthi logistics and supplies , the representative included .

To many of their fans , actor and author Nick Offerman is the picture of a real man . Now there 's a restroom sign to prove it .
A public bathroom in Madurai , India , appears to be using an image of the mustachioed `` Parks and Recreation '' star to mark its men 's toilet .
Michelle Johnson Blimes , of Pickerington , Ohio , photographed the sign after spotting it during their family vacation last month .
`` Do you think Nick Offerman knows their image is being used in Madurai , India , to label the men 's bathroom ? '' Blimes asked on Facebook .
The picture went viral and eventually grabbed the attention of the man himself .
Unlike their wood-whittling `` Parks and Rec '' character Ron Swanson -- a fierce personal privacy advocate -- Offerman did n't seem too disturbed that their face was being featured in such a way . In fact , they actually appeared to like it :
It 's not the first time Offerman 's image has been used to promote products , likely without the prior knowledge or approval of the comedian .
Their wife , actor Megan Mullally , even tweeted this picture of them appearing to promote a dental clinic in Russia :

The media just ca n't shut up about Donald Trump . In no small part , this is because their behavior appears to be inexplicable .
Where the most gaffe-prone big-league politician might go off the rails once every week or so , Trump does it several times every week , and sometimes several times every day . And where the most gaffe-prone big-league politicians quickly take back their verbal flubs , clarify , and apologize , hoping to move on before inflicting maximal political damage on themselves , Trump invariably doubles down , needlessly dragging out the controversies for endless days .
This seemingly self-destructive behavior has spawned , in turn , a cottage industry of armchair psychologizing of the man , who 's been repeatedly diagnosed as suffering from narcissistic personality disorder or maybe just `` insanity . ''
Something is going on with Donald Trump . But we do n't need a precise clinical diagnosis . It 's possible to examine Trump 's behavior over the past few weeks and reach a tentative understanding of their bizarrely self-subversive and flagrantly unpresidential statements and actions , including their tendency to flirt with inciting political violence .
Trump wants to lose the election . And they want to be able to blame someone else for the loss .
Consider the evidence . Since delivering a rabblerousing populist speech at the Republican convention , Trump has done the following :
1 . Attacked Ted Cruz 's non-endorsement at the convention by way of re-raising the loopiest accusation they floated during the primaries : that Cruz 's father was somehow involved in the assassination of John F. Kennedy .
2 . Spent close to a week lambasting the parents of a dead soldier who delivered a high profile anti-Trump speech at the Democratic convention .
3 . Made a point of refusing to endorse the sitting speaker of the House in a primary challenge . This lasted several days and ended with the endorsement being given after all .
4 . Threatened to skip the presidential debates , even though they need them far more than Hillary Clinton does .
5 . Continued to allow the Clinton campaign to outspend them on television advertising at a rate of $ 52.3 million to…zero .
6 . Suggested that if they lose to Clinton in November , it will be because the election was `` rigged . ''
7 . Implied that Clinton ( or their judicial appointments ) could face a threat of assassination by `` Second Amendment people '' if they win and appoints anti-gun judges .
It 's also worth noting that during this time , Trump 's modest post-convention bounce rapidly disappeared , with the campaign entering a polling free-fall . At the moment Trump appears to be losing nationally by 7 to 8 percentage points , with Clinton more than 10 points ahead in states with a combined electoral vote total of 253 — just 17 short of what they need to win . If this pattern continues , Trump will lose in a historic landslide .
So what can account for Trump 's behavior ?
At first sight , it appears perplexing . Items 1 to 5 seem to be the actions of someone deliberately out to sabotage himself . And some commentators have made exactly that claim : Trump wants to lose , because they feel he 's in over their head , because they think the job would be too much work , or perhaps because their ultimate aim is to prepare for a post-election launch of a new right-wing cable network to compete with Fox News .
Item 6 seems to point in the opposite direction — toward such overabundant confidence and craving for victory that Trump ca n't envision any scenario , short of voter fraud , in which they lose . As for item 7 — Trump 's convoluted insinuation that the country 's most passionate supporters of gun rights might resort to political violence against Hillary Clinton or their anti-gun judicial appointments — it could be interpreted in either direction : as a sign that Trump sees themselves at the head of a passionate political movement that is bound to prevail or yet another indication that they have no interest in doing the kinds of things ( like reining in their most outlandish rhetoric ) they would need to do to win .
But these two possibilities — a tendency toward self-sabotage and an overweening self-confidence — are actually not in conflict at all . The missing piece is the element of blame . Trump wants to lose — but they want the loss to be someone else 's fault . And they do n't care if the object of scorn is the media , the Republican Party establishment , or the country 's political establishment as a whole . All that matters is that their followers believe they , and he , have been robbed . Even if the resulting righteous indignation provokes political violence .
Two months ago my colleague Noah Millman pointed to precisely this kind of psychological dynamic in trying to figure out why Trump , shortly following their resounding triumph in the Republican primaries , chose to spend a week lashing out at Judge Gonzalo Curiel in racially charged terms when it had nothing whatsoever to do with their campaign for president and appeared to do that campaign nothing but harm . Millman 's suggestion ? The Trump University lawsuit was n't going well , so Trump decided to throw anything and everything at the judge in the hopes that one of the accusations — the judge is a racist ! — might stick and create an excuse to explain what would otherwise be a humiliating defeat .
Trump will do absolutely anything to avoid taking the blame for own failures , even ( and perhaps especially ) when their own actions rightly deserve the blame . And they could n't care less about the civically ruinous consequences .
The Republican nominee is exceedingly likely to lose in November , but they wo n't be the only one dragged down by the defeat . All of us have now been reduced to playing bit parts in Donald Trump 's personal psychodrama .
All Americans have the right to expect the Internal Revenue Service ( IRS ) to operate in a fair , apolitical and appropriate manner . As such , the direct admission by the IRS of having favored one political party over another has been terribly damaging to the public 's faith in our democracy . The politicization of the IRS must not be allowed to continue .
For a time , it seemed the media lost interest and the story faded from the front pages . But the day after Thanksgiving , the IRS issued a “ notice of proposed rulemaking ” – to effectively double down on the strategy of targeting political opponents . This notice came just days after Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid invoked the so-called “ nuclear option ” in the U.S. Senate , breaking more than 200 years of Senate tradition to suppress the rights of the minority party . Heading into an all-important election year , this “ permanent damage ” to the institution , to quote one Senate Democrat , helped set the stage for what the IRS later made perfectly clear : this administration will stop at nothing to maintain its grip on power .
The new IRS rule seeks to broadly expand the definition of “ candidate-related political activity ” for all 501 ( c ) ( 4 ) nonprofit organizations . Under this definition , social welfare organizations would face severe limitations on their participation in activities such as get-out-the-vote efforts , voter registration and education , communication that mentions a political candidate or party , or any events involving candidates . Regardless if these groups are to the left or right of the political spectrum , or entirely nonpartisan , this rule will prevent numerous Americans from exercising their constitutional right to participate in the political process .
According to the American Civil Liberties Union , these proposed regulations threaten “ to discourage or sterilize an enormous amount of political discourse in America. ” It is certainly hard to envision any good can come from the government getting involved in the regulation of political speech . But during an election year , it seems that those in power will stop at nothing to protect their status – even when it means stepping upon the constitutional rights of their fellow citizens .
Majority Leader Reid recently defended these proposed regulations by offering a series of broad-brushed statements about why Americans supposedly do not like 501 ( c ) ( 4 ) organizations , their policies or their financial backers . They claimed these nonprofit groups are deliberately “ going after people who are trying to improve the country. ” But their characterization of social welfare organizations as being intentionally harmful to our nation simply because they maintain a different political ideology is both unfair and demonstrably false .
In their recent comments , Majority Leader Reid went on to specifically accuse David and Charles Koch of “ trying to buy the country ” by participating in the political process , as if one 's First Amendment rights should only be respected when they align with a certain political party . I imagine if the tables were turned , they would find such statements about left-leaning groups to be quite offensive . No matter one 's political affiliations , the First Amendment rights of all Americans deserve to be respected and defended .
Last week , I joined Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona , Senator Pat Roberts of Kansas , and more than 30 of my Senate colleagues , in introducing legislation to put a stop to this blatant political targeting at the IRS . Our bill will return the IRS standards and definitions to exactly how they were written on Jan. 1 , 2010 – the date prior to when the agency 's inappropriate targeting began .
Newly-appointed IRS Commissioner John Koskinen has pledged to restore the public 's trust in the IRS . The best way to accomplish this is to immediately put a stop to the proposed 501 ( c ) ( 4 ) rule changes . This would make it clear that the IRS will no longer tolerate crackdowns on free speech and offer American taxpayers hope that their faith in this powerful , but broken institution may one day be restored .
Disc Golf World Tour To Include Women 's Division In 2017
The Disc Golf World Tour will include an Open Women 's division at three of its four events for the 2017 season , tour director Jussi Meresmaa confirmed to Ultiworld Disc Golf this morning . It 's a shift from this past season , when the tour abided by a “ One Division , One Champion ” mantra .
The Aussie Open , Konopiste Open , and European Open will all feature FPO fields , while the United States Disc Golf Championship will adhere to a single division . Meresmaa said that two of those three events being PDGA Majors played a role in the decision .
“ Yes , we want to give female players an opportunity to play DGWT courses , ” Meresmaa said in an email . “ We will still concentrate in our media efforts to outline MPO field and with [ the ] help of PDGA there will be media coverage from FPO field too . ”
The lack of a women 's division at World Tour events was often a point of scrutiny during the 2016 season , with some players actively boycotting the events .
President Donald Trump pauses as they talk to the White House travel pool on board Air Force One on Feb. 3 . Carlos Barria/Reuters
Since taking office , President Trump has lied about many things : their victory margin , their inaugural crowd size , millions of illegal votes , and anything else they feel like saying . On Saturday , they accused President Obama of tapping their phones . On Tuesday , they said 122 Guantanamo Bay prisoners released by Obama had returned to the battlefield . All of this is false .
Trump has been getting away with this nonsense for nearly two years . How ? By pitting themselves against opponents with credibility problems of their own . In the Republican primaries , it was “ the politicians. ” In the general election , it was Crooked Hillary . Now , it 's the media . Trump and their senior strategist , Steve Bannon , targeted the press for two reasons . * First , it 's the principal conduit for negative information about him . Trump and Bannon want voters to assume that everything published about Trump 's incompetence , self-enrichment , or Russian shenanigans is “ fake news. ” Second , the press is unpopular . “ You have a lower approval rate than Congress , ” Trump told reporters at a press conference last month . Isolating and vilifying journalists is a shrewd authoritarian strategy .
Trump ca n't execute that strategy , however , because he 's addicted to conflict . Instead of sticking to the press , they have picked fights with other professions and institutions . Trump and Bannon call the media “ the enemy of the people ” and “ the opposition party. ” But thanks to Trump 's compulsive antagonism , the opposition party is expanding . It 's growing to include the CIA , the FBI , the courts , and every other fact-finding institution Trump has attacked . Like many a tyrant before him , Trump is getting into a war too big to win .
Three years ago , Trump accused the medical establishment of covering up of links ( which do n't exist ) between vaccines and autism . “ The doctors lied , ” Trump charged . In their campaign , Trump repeated their vaccine quackery and dismissed climate change as a fraud . Two weeks after their election , they suggested that climate-change scientists could n't be trusted .
Going after journalists , doctors , and scientists was n't enough . In December , Trump took on a new enemy . Responding to a leaked U.S. intelligence assessment that Russia had intervened in the election , Trump attacked the intelligence agencies .
On Twitter , they mocked them , putting ironic quotes around “ intelligence. ” They accused them of groping for evidence against Russia , deliberately leaking falsehoods about him , and targeting them as though working for “ Nazi Germany. ” At a Jan. 11 press conference , they said it was “ disgraceful that the intelligence agencies ” had tarnished them with “ information that turned out to be so false and fake . ”
At first , the only agency Trump named was the CIA . But last month , they went further . Incensed that their national security adviser , Michael Flynn , had been caught lying about a secret phone call with Russia 's ambassador , Trump lambasted the FBI and the National Security Agency , which monitors such calls . “ Information is being illegally given to the failing @ nytimes & @ washingtonpost by the intelligence community ( NSA and FBI ? ) . Just like Russia , ” Trump tweeted . The NSA and FBI “ should not interfere in our politics , ” they warned . A week later , they fumed that the FBI “ ca n't even find the leakers within the FBI . ”
Trump also went after the judiciary . Last year , they said the judge overseeing a fraud case against them was unfit because of their Mexican “ heritage. ” Last month , Trump denounced a “ so-called judge ” who ruled against their anti-Muslim travel ban in federal district court . “ If something happens blame them and court system , ” Trump tweeted . When the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals refused to block the district judge 's ruling , Trump called the circuit court “ political ” and “ a bad court . ”
On Saturday , Trump launched another attack . In a tweet storm , they accused Obama of “ tapping my phones ” in Trump Tower . They wrote of their predecessor : “ This is Nixon/Watergate . Bad ( or sick ) guy ! ” Obama denied the charge . James Clapper , the former director of national intelligence , said no such tap had been authorized . FBI Director James Comey , who knew Trump 's allegations were false , asked the Justice Department to deny them . But the White House refused . On Good Morning America , George Stephanopoulos asked : “ Does President Trump accept the FBI director 's denial ? ” And Trump 's deputy press secretary , Sarah Huckabee Sanders , replied : “ I do n't think they do . ”
Scientists , doctors , judges , former presidents . CIA , NSA , DNI , FBI . Trump picks fights with everyone . They stake their credibility against theirs : Either they 're all lying or they are . This is n't he-said-she-said between Trump and the Washington Post , or between Trump and the New York Times . It 's he-said-everyone-said : Trump 's version of reality on one side , and everybody else 's version on the other . With their nutty claims about crowd size and illegal votes , Trump has even drawn rebuttals from the Federal Election Commission and the National Park Service .
And that carries a price . Since their second week in office , Trump 's net approval rating has been negative , far below that of any recorded president . One reason is that together , the press , the scientists , the courts , and the intelligence agencies are more credible than they are .
By itself , the press is weak . In a December NBC News/Wall Street Journal survey , only 16 percent of respondents said they had “ a great deal ” or “ quite a bit ” of confidence in the national news media . The numbers were much higher for the FBI ( 32 percent ) , the CIA ( 33 percent ) , the Supreme Court ( 37 percent ) , and “ police and law enforcement agencies ” ( 59 percent ) . When the press stands with other institutions , it fares better . On climate change , for instance , only 7 percent of respondents surveyed last year by the Pew Research Center said they trusted the news media a lot . But 40 percent said they trusted the news media , climate scientists , or both .
How bad a mess Trump is getting themselves into ? The best answer comes from a Morning Consult/Politico poll taken in December , just after Trump challenged the intelligence agencies ' assessment of Russian interference . The poll asked : “ How much do you trust each of the following when it comes to providing accurate information about foreign intelligence and events overseas that impact the U.S. ? ” The questionnaire offered four answers : a lot , some , not much , or not at all . None of the three categories of media that were tested—newspapers , network news , or cable news—earned “ a lot ” of trust from more than 15 percent of the voters sampled . Trump , with 21 percent , beat each of those groups . That put them even with the CIA and marginally above the FBI and NSA , which scored 20 percent each .
But people who trust newspapers , people who trust the CIA , and people who trust the FBI are n't the same people . These sets only partial overlap . When you pool them together , by pitting Trump against the combined credibility of the institutions they have attacked , they get swamped .
To illustrate this effect , Slate asked Morning Consult to compute , from its sample of 2000 registered voters , the percentage who expressed a lot of trust in at least one of the institutions denounced by Trump . We started with newspapers . Then we added other media . Then the CIA , the NSA , the FBI , and finally Obama . As the pool increased—recapitulating Trump 's accumulation of disputes and enemies—the percentage rose .
Forty-seven percent of voters expressed a lot of trust in at least one of the people or institutions against whose credibility Trump has staked their own truthfulness . That 's more than twice the 21 percent who expressed such trust in Trump . And that 's before you add other professions and institutions , such as doctors , scientists , and judges , who were n't included in this poll but have scored well in other surveys of public trust .
After years of Trump 's lies , it 's natural to wonder whether the laws of political gravity apply to him . They do . They have gotten this far by taking on one unpopular opponent after another : Jeb Bush , Ted Cruz , Hillary Clinton . Maybe Trump could have beaten the press one-on-one . Instead , they have opened a war of credibility against too many institutions . It 's a war they did n't have to fight and is unlikely to win .

When it comes to restaurants , San Francisco 's Hayes Valley is the new Mission . Properties are opening there like we saw a few years ago on Valencia Street .
In the last year alone I 've reviewed Nightbird , Corridor and A Mano . The latest , RT Rotisserie , adds another great option to the expanding neighborhood and for those visiting one of the nearby performance centers .
RT Rotisserie reflects several other trends — including the most obvious , rotisserie chicken . In addition the restaurant offers counter service and food with an impeccable pedigree from a well-known chef . At RT , on the corner of Oak and Franklin streets , Evan and Sarah Rich follow up their fully realized Rich Table that 's a block away from the new concept .
They take a similar path as other top fine-dining chefs who have opened quick-serve restaurants around the Bay Area : Dave Cruz , who made their name at Bouchon and Ad Hoc , opened Little Gem ; Scott Clark , formerly of Saison , launched Dad 's Luncheonette ; Camino 's Russell Moore opened Kebabery in Oakland ; and Manresa 's Michael Gaines has their Mexican concept , Glena 's .
The quick-serve place is the wave of the future . And it makes a lot of sense in the Hayes Valley neighborhood , increasingly filled with young workers who want something fast and good . There 's also a built-in audience during performance season at the nearby opera , symphony , ballet and jazz venues , for people who want a bite before or after the event .
While RT Rotisserie may be quick-serve , there is no compromise in the quality , and the price is enticing . Rotisserie chicken is at the center of the menu , but this is no ordinary rotisserie chicken . The birds are brined for 24 hours in seasoned buttermilk then hung for two days to firm the flesh and concentrate the flavor . They are threaded on the rotisserie to cook , and right before serving they are passed under the broiler to further crispen the skin .
After all that preparation , Rich charges only $ 10 for a half chicken and $ 19 for the whole bird .
This labor-intensive technique produces one of the best rotisserie chickens I 've had . It 's so good that I kept forgetting to use one of the four sauces provided : chimichurri , Douglas fir sour cream , chipotle yogurt and Nanny 's barbecue .

The other rotisserie item is a whole head of cauliflower ( $ 9 ) that 's as golden as the chicken . It 's served on a bed of beet hummus and seasoned with smoked garlic , fried garlic and a scattering of fresh herbs . It 's outstanding . It comes with two sauces ; my favorite is the Douglas fir sour cream where its lemon-meets-pine nuances accentuate the slightly smoky flavor .
This core menu is augmented with a couple of other options : a chicken sandwich ( $ 12 ) stuffed into a ciabatta roll with mixed greens , pickled onions and garlicky aioli ; and an equally enticing pork sandwich ( $ 12 ) with at least eight layers of the thinly sliced , robust meat complemented with chipotle , charred cabbage and crunchy fried onions .
These sandwiches are so generous that they can easily serve two normal appetites when accompanied by one of the excellent salads or vegetables .
One staple is charred cabbage and almonds ( $ 5 ) — a perfect treatment for this vegetable because the smokiness brings out the natural sweetness . There 's also a “ market vegetable ” or two that , on my most recent visit , was corn and tomatoes sprinkled with cotija cheese .
The RT salad ( $ 10 ) is a bright , bountiful mix of greens with cucumbers , radishes , sunflower seeds , dried fruit and herbs . Diners can also have it topped with chicken or cauliflower for $ 3 more . Umami fries ( $ 6 ) are thick spears of potatoes dusted in rice and porcini powder . They are really good , but I 'm not sure why everyone is trying to embellish what is a near perfect food when properly fried and salted .
About the only other item on the menu is the chicken soup ( $ 7 ) ; the bronze broth is accented with barley , greens , pickled onions and fresh lime . Again , the chef 's talent is evident in the rich , layered broth .
Dessert is a choice of one large chocolate mint cookie ( $ 3 ) and soft-serve milk ice and sorbet ( $ 5 ) . I like the clean , lingering freshness of what they call milk ice even better than regular soft serve . The sorbets are memorable . On one visit , Sarah Rich offered a melon flavor , which seemed to capture the sweetness of the season in its frozen swirls .
From start to finish at RT , you see the influence of a fine dining sensibility . The staff is extremely friendly , and even though you order at the counter and take a number to the table , they circulate to remove plates and bring water , and are readily available if customers need anything . The interior features a mix of wood , tile and metal — a fresh , organic look that is like a more contemporary version of Rich Table .
RT Rotisserie is a modern concept that combines the best of two worlds — fast service and slow food — in a winning way .

Australian man Nicholas James Langan jailed for one year for smoking joint on Bali beach
Updated
An Australian man has been jailed for a year after they were caught smoking a marijuana joint on a beach on the Indonesian resort island of Bali .
25-year-old Nicholas James Langan , from Townsville in north Queensland , was arrested on popular Batu Bolong beach in January after they were found smoking the drug with an Indonesian who worked as a driver at a hotel .
A small bag containing 0.86 grams of marijuana was also seized .
Prosecutor Denny Iswanto demanded Langan be jailed for four years , but the court , overseen by chief justice Cening Budiana , gave the Australian one year in jail , on the grounds that they were polite , honest and still young .
`` The defendant is proven convincingly and legally guilty of misusing drugs for personal use , '' the judge told the court as they sentenced Langan .
Langan , through an interpreter , told reporters they `` needed time to consider '' whether to appeal the verdict .
The Indonesian driver was also sentenced to one year in jail .
With potential for sentence cuts for good behaviour , Langan could be freed and deported to Australia within months .
Indonesia has recently stepped up a campaign against drug use and the tough sentence came almost three months after eight drug convicts , including Australians Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran , were executed by firing squad despite international appeals for mercy .
Indonesia has some of the toughest anti-drugs laws in the world .
Jakarta resumed executions in 2013 after a hiatus of several years and president Joko Widodo , who took office in October , has been a vocal supporter of the death penalty for drug traffickers .

I spend a lot of time shooting or walking on the streets of New York . You see every type of camera imaginable here , from the latest and greatest DSLRs to old Rollei 's and film cameras . If you hang around B & H long enough , you 'll probably see Louis Mendes with their old Speed Graphic . But I have never , ever seen anyone shoots with what Justin Borucki is using . This guy might have the most unique camera setup in New York .
Justin Borucki has taken the concept of capturing fast-disappearing “ old New York ” , but added a unique twist . Instead of simply capturing store fronts , or areas of the city that are under dramatic and rapid change from gentrification , rezoning or condo developments , he 's gone one step further .
Justin has been shooting wet plate collodion photographs in areas of the city that remind them of what it used to look like when they were a kid , with the aim of capturing them before they change forever . Not only does the process yield beautiful imagery , but their work transforms modern day New York into something that looks like it was shot a century ago .
Bay Ridge , Brooklyn 2013
Brooklyn Bridge 2014
Bushwick , Brooklyn 2013
Chinatown 2014
Coney Island 2014
East Village 2014
You could pass this off as some kind of insane hipster folly , but Justin admits it took at least 6 months of work before they began to get images that were of any real substance . He 's been shooting like this for over a year now and working that hard and lugging around this heavy set up says a lot about their determination and committment to the projeect . If you watch the video , you can see just how sincere they are about what they are doing .
Justin has genuinely captured some wonderful imagery here . I remember how different they city looked when I first visited only 16 years ago compared to today . The change in the last few years alone has been startling . If nothing else , this is at least helping preserve a wonderful photographic legacy of what this amazing city used to look like before it 's all gone .

This is the final installment of our in-depth look at No-Huddle offenses and how they 've changed the landscape of college football . Part 1 examined the philosophy behind changing an offense 's tempo , while Part 2 discussed how tempo impacts an offense 's play-calling .
Not long after Chip Kelly took over the University of Oregon offense in 2007 , transforming it into the high-octane scoring machine that has come to define the program ever since , some interesting characters began showing up on the Ducks ' sideline . Standing high above the heads of coaches and backup quarterbacks feverishly sending in hand signals to the players on the field were the faces of numerous celebrities , superheroes , animals , and countless other seemingly random symbols , spread into one of four quadrants on a giant poster board .
These confusing signs began receiving more and more TV air time as their increasing presence seemed to coincide with the success of Kelly 's offense , which grew to become one of the most uniquely dangerous units in the nation . Analysts could only guess what the symbols meant , as Oregon coaches refused to disclose their exact meaning . As time has gone on , countless college and high school programs have adopted the approach , leading to more and more visual collections appearing on sidelines across America each fall .
But while the novelty of seeing Ron Burgundy 's face play a role in a critical 3rd down still remains today , the use of such a method underscores a much larger , and often overlooked aspect of the game . Many football fans are used to the NFL game , which allows the quarterback and middle linebacker receive the play-call directly from a coach via a radio inside their helmet ( one of many innovations Ohio football deity Paul Brown gave to the game ) . Outside of the professional level though , coaches have always had to find different means of communicating with their charges on the field .
Brown 's tinkering with radios was a replacement for their initial play-calling method , in which they rotated two players between the same position on every play . Their play would be told to the substituting player , who would relay it to the quarterback , who would then relay it to the rest of the huddle . This is a common method still used today , especially at the pee-wee and junior high levels .
But for coaches that want to move quickly between plays , do n't want to substitute in such a pattern , or whose players do n't even huddle at all , this method of communication is clearly not an option . Instead , these coaches have often fallen into one of two camps : those that use wrist cards or those that rely on symbols .
The big difference between the two is not the physical method by which the play is actually communicated , as the process of using countless hand signals , pictures , cards or even just yelling a code word can be seen in both systems . Rather , the difference is a philosophical one that ties back directly to the way coaches communicate their playbook in general .
Coaches that use wrist cards believe in the idea of taking their existing , larger playbook and shrinking parts of it down to what can fit on the card inside a player 's wristband . Some of these wristbands offer room for as many as 84 plays , and the coaches simply need to signal where the players should look on the card to know the play call ( such as 'Red 7 ' meaning look to the red column , row 7 ) . Some uptempo systems will give the wristbands to every skill position player , allowing receivers to move directly to their pre-snap alignment , while giving the quarterback or running back the responsibility of communicating the call to the offensive line .
There are obvious benefits to such a system , as the play sheet can be changed at any time , be it week-to-week or series-to-series , as the communication system itself does not change , just what it signals . Additionally , it 's relatively easy to implement this philosophy , as players are n't constantly learning new signals throughout the season .
However , the system lacks the one thing that true no-huddle believers value most : speed . The time needed for players to all see the signals from the sideline , find the play on their card , and then get to their spot to line up might not seem very long , but every second is precious when team is trying to snap the ball before the defense is ready .
Such a need facilitated the development of 'symbol ' systems , which brought with it a fundamental shift in the way players and coaches not only communicate , but in the way they 're taught . Instead of basing play calls on numbers associated with patterns in a route tree , which tells every player exactly where they 're supposed to go , coaches began teaching the full concepts to each player , and identifying them with short , easy-to-remember names like snag , smash , or sail .
After learning all the different routes or blocking assignments in a specific concept , players should theoretically know which one they 're supposed to execute once it 's paired with a formation . For instance , if a formation calls for there to be two receivers split out on the same side as a tight end , and the play called is the 'snag ' concept , the tight end knows that as the # 3 receiver to that side they should run the flat arrow route to the sideline .
The beauty of the symbol system is that it can create literal links for the players to understand , as they are often involved in the development for the signals that symbolize a specific play . As an example , the signaler might clap their two hands together as if they were smashing something to symbolize the 'smash ' concept .
With this method in place , it becomes very easy for teams to add in new concepts from week to week , as there is literally no limit to the number of symbols that can be created and what they stand for . This is of course where the asupervisorstioned signs from Oregon come into play . It 's much easier to simply show a new image which has its own meaning rather than coming up with a hand signal for a new concept that may be added to the game plan .
There are still some downsides to using the symbol system , though . First , for a team to operate in this mindset , they must communicate with them at all times in practice . The language of symbols must be ingrained into their memory like a second language .
Second , the system is very simplistic in its approach , which has made the jobs of NFL talent evaluators far more difficult . The majority of college teams that run uptempo offenses communicate with the symbol system , per a recent study conducted by X and O labs , making the questions asked of Cam Newton 's ability to read a defense in 2011 even more common just a few years later .
But college coaches are paid to win games , not develop NFL quarterbacks ( although the recruiting aspect of this issue could certainly merit debate ) .
However , there is one final downside to the philosophy of using symbols , as there is a strong possibility of these symbols being decoded by one 's opponent . For a team like Ohio State , which runs the same 'tight zone ' play dozens , if not hundreds , of times over the course of a season , they must complicate their system of communication in order to avoid their signs from being stolen .
To do so , teams will often break up their communications into as many as four different pieces , regardless of whether they use wristbands or symbols :
Personnel
Formation
Snap Count
Play/Concept
From where each piece of info will come from often changes on every series , with countless fake signals included to throw off any potential thieves . Once all these pieces are put together , the result can be overwhelming to anyone trying to spot a pattern .
There are endless ways in which a play call can physically be communicated in an uptempo offense , with the the only common trait between any two teams being that they 're individually distinct . While much in the game of football is copied and passed down from coach to coach , the way in which every team builds their specific method of communication is truly unique .
Though there is no 'wrong ' way to set up a team 's communication structure , there are wrong ways to implement it . Much like the way an entire offense must buy into the philosophy of going uptempo , they must also be willing to put in the work to learn the system of communication .
Regardless of how long a player or coach has been in a program , they must be willing to adopt a new language every summer in training camp . From the starting quarterback to a walk-on wideout , the head coach to a graduate assistant , every person involved in the offense must commit to fully transitioning an uptempo philosophy into a reality .

A plan to build two huge tunnels to shunt fresh water around the Sacramento Delta is supposed to be funded entirely by the people who receive the water . But taxpayers may end up paying a substantial amount of the tab .
That 's according to documents obtained by the Stockton-based environmental group Restore the Delta that discuss the cost of the California WaterFix project , which is projected to cost at least $ 16 billion to build . According to an unpublished 2015 draft analysis obtained by the group , California WaterFix would require a federal subsidy of nearly $ 4 billion in order to be cost-effective for agricultural water users .
That runs counter to state promises that the tunnels project would be funded entirely by water users . And even with a federal bailout , most of the project 's expenses may end up being paid for primarily by Southern California households .
“ I believe that next to Delta people , Southern California people will be the most harmed [ by this project ] , ” Restore The Delta 's executive director Barbara Barrigan-Parrilla told KCET .
California WaterFix 's hefty price tag comes as no surprise . The project would involve burying two 30-mile long , 40-foot wide tunnels as much as 150 feet under the Delta , bringing fresh water from intakes near Clarksburg on the Sacramento River to the State Water Project 's Banks Pumping Plant near Livermore . There , the water would be pumped into the California Aqueduct for use by farms and cities , most of them in the Central Valley and Southern California .
The tunnels purport to address a significant problem with California 's existing water delivery system by bypassing the Delta . At present , the Banks Pumping Plant and its federal counterpart , the Central Valley Project 's Jones Pumping Plant , pump water directly from the southern Delta , reversing the flows of some rivers and sloughs , and causing salt water from San Francisco Bay to infiltrate the Delta 's freshwater ecosystem .
The revised version of the Peripheral Canal , now an underground project called the California WaterFix , is still on the drawing board .
By shunting Sacramento River water directly to the plants through tunnels instead of through a circuitous network of Delta channels , California WaterFix would , in theory , provide benefits to Delta wildlife and cleaner water for Southern California farms and cities .
But critics charge that the tunnels , capable of diverting the entire flow of the Sacramento in dry years , would provide justification for increased water exports from an ecosystem already reeling from both exports and drought .
And while the state has long pledged that no taxpayer funds would go toward the project 's construction costs , the November 2015 cost-benefit analysis obtained by Restore the Delta projects that making water users pay for the whole project could prompt agricultural users to opt out altogether .
The analysis , prepared for the state 's Natural Resources Agency by U.C . Berkeley economist David Sunding for the consulting firm the Brattle Group , found that even with a $ 3.6 billion boost from the federal government or some other source , California WaterFix still did n't make economic sense for agricultural water users . “ Under the currently negotiated operating criteria , ” Sunding writes in the report , “ the WaterFix does not provide benefits in excess of costs for most agricultural water users . ”
While Sunding did find that the project made economic sense for urban water customers , dissatisfaction from ag water companies could make that a whole lot more complicated . Among the documents Restore the Delta obtained through its Public Records Act request was an April 8 , 2016 email from David Sunding to the Hallmark Group , a financial services firm hired to act as program manager for the WaterFix project . In the email , Sunding mentions a draft “ exit ramp ” option available to WaterFix customers who choose not to stay with the project , and a discussion of which remaining customers would pick up their financial obligations .

If disenchanted agricultural water companies merge onto that exit ramp , one company likely to be asked to pick up their share of the expenses is the Metropolitan Water District , the project 's largest potential customer . MWD agreed in 2014 to bankroll the project 's pre-construction expenses on behalf of other State Water Project customers .
A September 2014 memo detailing a draft agreement between MWD and the California Department of Water Resources ( DWR ) said that — at least in the draft agreement — MWD would be financing up to $ 400 million in pre-construction costs by issuing “ commercial paper , ” a finance industry term for short-term unsecured promissory notes .
And that raises the possibility of another route by which taxpayers might end up footing some of the bill for the project : MWD has the authority to levy property taxes , the proceeds from which the company typically uses to fulfill debt obligations . In the 2014 draft agreement , DWR would collect money from other SWP customers to pay down those companies ' share of MWD 's debt . But if those companies are unable to pay , MWD property owners could end up shouldering that burden .
“ Metropolitan water users will pay for the tunnels four ways , ” Barrigan-Parrilla told KCET . “ Higher water rates , property taxes , state taxes , and federal taxes . ”
Unsecured commercial paper is an instrument available only to companies with impeccable credit . That option may not be open to all prospective WaterFIx customers . The Westlands Water District , to pick the most obvious example , had its credit rating dinged after revelations that the district had misrepresented earnings to potential bond buyers . As a robust company that will account for at least 27 percent of whatever water supplies the WaterFix project delivers , it 's not hard to imagine MWD — and its customers and taxpayers — being asked to shoulder more and more of the project 's costs if ag customers fall by the wayside .
“ Let 's just say ag decides you ca n't participate ; you 're not going to build a project . Metropolitan is not going to build the project. ” — Roger Patterson , MWD
MWD spokesperson Bob Muir downplayed the potential cost of the WaterFix project to SoCal households . “ We project the impact on our customers will be $ 5 per family per month , ” Muir told KCET . They said that Met 's projected contribution to the whole project would run between three and four billion dollars , and pointed out that the company already pays half a billion a year for its share of water from the State Water Project . “ That 's a flat fee , ” Muir said . “ We pay that regardless of how much SWP water we get each year . ”
Muir could n't comment on whether the 2014 draft agreement reflects current financial agreements between MWD and DWR over preconstruction financing for the WaterFix project . MWD General Manager Jeff Kightlinger has informed their Board of Directors that MWD wo n't spend any additional funds on the project until a financing agreement is in place . And in April , at a statewide water conference sponsored by Capitol Weekly , MWD Assistant General Manager Roger Patterson told attendees that MWD has no interest in going it alone on California WaterFix . “ Let 's just say ag decides you ca n't participate ; you 're not going to build a project . Metropolitan is not going to build the project . ”
At that same conference , panelist Jeff Michael , Director of the Center for Business and Policy Research at the University of the Pacific , implied that MWD is n't the only water company thinking about financing its WaterFix expenditures through property taxes :
it is important to note that urban water districts are talking about raising property taxes for this and not putting all of the costs into water rates , and so that would be a mispricing of water by paying for it with property taxes , which I understand is increasingly part of the plan .
Earlier this year , project proponents were hoping to complete both financing agreements and environmental review of the project by the end of the year . That 's becoming increasingly unlikely as we reach October , and with each year 's delay costs of the project increase .
All this for a project that may not bring southern water users any additional security if the drought hangs on . University of the Pacific 's Jeff Michael pointed out in a response to Sunding 's draft cost-benefit analysis that Sunding based their benefit figures on the assumption that the tunnels would provide four times as much water as the project 's own environmental documents assume . If an updated analysis now being prepared by Sunding addresses this , it may be that the drought itself makes the state 's main drought defense strategy not worth the cost .

Observations of a B2C startup product manager working in enterprise .
I once heard an anecdote about a very young child being told a story about a very old man . The child was asked to imagine what this octogenarian would look like . And the child said that as they were very , very old they must be very , very tall…
To this child , where every passing month was another pencil line on the kitchen wall , it stood to reason that 80 years later you would be 80 years taller . And as ridiculous as it sounds to an adult ( whose sensible and wondrous logic has since been replaced by the mundanity of realism and experience ) I may have been guilty of applying the same rationale in the world of business .
A startup , finding its feet and learning how to stand , should by certain logic be less wise , less capable and less developed than its older , wiser counterparts . Lessons are learned the hard way by trying and failing ; structures and processes are thrown together ad hoc and then hopefully improved upon somewhere down the line .
So having lived in that scrappy startup world for all my professional life thus far I took a leap a couple of years ago , packed my Post-Its and trundled off to the metaphorical big city – Tes Global , an established business with a near 100 % penetration of its target market and a legacy of over a century – to see what the difference really is .
And from my sample size of one , what have I observed ? Is the old man very wise and genuinely very very tall ? Well , no . They are n't a glorious giant , just a man with more experience under their belt .
Neither necessarily good nor bad , there are however differences between how the young child and the old man view the world . This means a change in approach for product managers operating in startup and corporate environments .
Here are two of my most notable product take-aways and one piece of advice for survival .
1 . Your Customers Are n't Your Only Users…
In a small start-up team , of five , 15 , 50 , it is likely that your product is either the thing that you sell – your SaaS platform , your game , your blog – or the way that you sell it – your sign-up lists , your e-commerce platform , your marketplace . It is a core interaction with customers and what they derive value from .
As a product manager your raison d'être is these users and providing them the greatest value with the least effort . That is your role in propelling the business forwards .
However as the company gets bigger , into the 10s , 100s or 1,000s , even whilst still managing a consumer product you are more likely to have the onus of supporting separate internal business units with different remits . The customers of your product are no longer solely the users outside the building but also all your colleagues within who need to interact with it on a regular basis .
As a B2C product manager your raison d'être is still your external customers , but you have to service the internal customers as well… Marketing needs to be able to run targeted promotional campaigns on-site and Customer Services needs to be able to change the email address on a customer account ; Merchandising needs to showcase best-selling products and Sales needs to report on total transactions .
In a corporate environment , more so than in an early-stage business , keep one eye on external customers and one on internal customers and you 'll be onto a winner .
2 . YOU are Responsible for the big Picture
All new businesses start somewhere , with a tiny number of people . These people came together with an idea , a mission and a drive to make something happen . Often at this stage , the founders know what they want to create and they have an idea of what the product needs to achieve . In many cases the product goal is the company goal .
The first product manager positions in this early-stage environment are shepherding roles as much as visionary ones . It 's sanity-checking and reality-checking these entrepreneurial ambitions and ideas against actual user need and resourcing capacity . It 's instilling those early processes to save valuable time and ensure that only the most relevant and meaningful work is being taken on .
At a corporate stage , ideas are no less bountiful . These come from all directions with many more viewpoints and with different motivations . It would be easy to make the product manager role solely about shepherding and prioritising the ideas on the table and project managing these to completion .
However in these larger organisations it 's likely that the mission is n't as clear or that your team can be situated further from mission control , making the incoming signal blurry , so what are you prioritising against ? In the worst scenarios , decision-making may succumb to HiPPO – the Highest-Paid Person 's Opinion .
It is your responsibility to be thinking in detail about the purpose of your specific product and what it aims to achieve .
These enterprise product manager roles can be ( counterintuitively , even more so than the startup roles ) about taking a massive step back and taking control of the product vision .
It 's about uniting the teams around a shared goal – a shared purpose for these ideas – where your product and your customer experience is at the centre . All ideas must be driving you towards this North Star , or you could find yourself going nowhere fast .
3 . Do n't Forget to Keep Celebrating Small Wins !
In a startup , it can be easier to see the wins from a product team 's work in a world of company firsts – the first paying customer , the first product launch , the first 100 transactions .
In the context of a longer-standing established business , celebratory milestones are n't always as obvious – an established business may not celebrate your product 's 1000th visitor or your first £10k revenue when they 've serviced millions of customers over decades and they have dozens of other products all contributing their part to the company 's bottom line .
In the context of the business as a whole any given achievement may be a drop in the ocean , but for your product and your team these achievements should be Everything .
As a product manager in a larger , more corporate environment , it comes down to you to define these small victories , to help the team reach them and then to sing these successes from the rooftops . These enterprise victories need n't even be “ firsts ” and could instead be “ bests ” – the best conversion rate , the best repeat visit rate , the best NPS .
Your product team and your wider stakeholder team will be buoyed with confidence and motivated by their ability to create meaningful change , in turn giving your product more freedom and power to deliver even more exciting changes in the future .
At the end of the day neither the wizened old man nor the cheeky young upstart has life all figured out . Thriving in both environments still needs good , solid product management at the core .
But recognising some of the differences between these different business contexts may ease your transition and ultimately help make your product a success .
`` I was told [ they ] no longer existed , '' says Robert Richardson , who captured the film 's super-widescreen images with Ultra Panavision 70 lenses that had n't been used since 1966 's 'Khartoum . '
This story first appeared in the Jan. 15 issue of The Hollywood Reporter magazine . To receive the magazine , click here to subscribe .
In a backroom at Panavision 's Woodland Hills offices , Robert Richardson stumbled upon a Holy Grail of sorts . Quentin Tarantino had turned to the Oscar-winning cinematographer to figure out how to fulfill their dream of releasing The Hateful Eight as a 70mm movie . Richardson discovered a set of classic Ultra Panavision 70 lenses , last used for 1966 's Khartoum , that would allow them to shoot in superwide 2:76:1 ratio .
“ I was told those lenses no longer existed , ” says Richardson , explaining that it was while they were at Panavision to meet with the company 's optical engineering vp Dan Sasaki that they discovered “ these very funky-looking lenses. ” Adds the cinematographer : “ Quentin was extraordinarily happy because they wanted the widest format possible. ” First , though , those vintage lenses required some refurbishing . “ The problem was these lenses had n't been used since the '60s , so none of them would work on a modern film camera , ” explains Sasaki . “ So I offered these to Robert not knowing I 'd get the whole company involved in supporting the project. ” In the end , Panavision retrofitted 15 of the lenses with varying focal lengths in just a few months .
Since Tarantino and Richardson wanted long takes for the movie 's dialogue-heavy sequences , Panavision also developed larger magazines for the film cameras while Kodak made longer 1,800-foot film rolls ( as opposed to the usual 1,000-foot rolls ) of 65mm Kodak Vision3 5219 film . That allowed for takes as long as 16 minutes , filming at 24 frames per second , compared with the slightly less than nine minutes that would have been available on 1,000-foot reels . The wide format also allowed Richardson to include many of the film 's characters in the same frame at once , capturing their reactions to one another . “ That 's what Quentin loved most — to be able to include as many characters as possible within the shot without having to single them out , ” says Richardson . “ Having them all there , especially as the tension rises , makes it more of a thriller . You have visual evidence of their whereabouts in almost every shot . ”
It was an arduous shoot , much of it shot on location in the snow near Telluride . “ We were above 10,000 feet . Usually when we arrived on set , it was between minus-10 and minus-20 degrees , ” says production sound mixer Mark Ulano . “ Most of the physical locations are not something you drove to — you were on a snowmobile to a drop-off point , where you then might hike another quarter-mile in sub-zero temperatures . ”
On the other hand , for shots where the production needed to remove walls to fit the camera gear , the interior of Minnie 's was additionally built on a stage at Red Studios in Hollywood , Richardson notes that to get the actors ' breath to show onscreen , “ Quentin got a fleet of air conditioners ; it was colder on stage than on location . It was also so moist , because to get the breath , you needed the right dewpoint . We had blankets on the camera . ”
German car tuning company G-Power delivered the power with this BMW M6 , breaking the world record for fastest sedan at a top speed of 370 km/h or 231 mph . Naming it the Hurricane CS , this is the fastest BMW coupe in the world with a powerful twin supercharged V10 engine delivering 750 hp and 590 ft-lbs of torque . To get these astounding numbers out of a BMW , the engineers at G-Power had to install belt driven ASA T1-316 superchargers , and forged pistons from Mahle were used to reduce compression . The pistons from Mahle are exactly the same weight as the stock pistons , however significantly stronger to handle the extra boost from the superchargers . To optimize the V10 engine , a remapping of the ECU was needed for the superchargers .
To handle world record speeds for a production BMW M6 coupe , Michelin Pilot Sport PS2 tires in sizes 255/35 ZR19 are used in the front and 305/30 ZR19 tires in the rear . If you plan on using the Hurricane CS for daily use , 21″ Silverstone Diamond wheels with tires that fit them respectively are used , however these wheels are only stable up to 211 mph . A completely new titanium exhaust system was installed that weighs 53 lbs less than the stock unit , and carbon fiber seats were also added to reduce the weight by 26 lbs for each seat . With the huge power gains and extra weight savings , this BMW M6 is able to reach 62 mph in 4.4 seconds , 124 mph in 9.6 seconds , and 187 mph in just 26 seconds .
With those kinds of speeds , G-Power needed to ensure the BMW would be able to stop on a dime if the end of the track approached too soon . So they switched the stock brakes with a 50 % lighter Carbon-Ceramic system , with 6-piston calippers and large 380 mm brake discs . A G-Power adjustable coilover suspension was added as well , and it has nine different settings the owner can use to set their desired comfort . Exterior modifications include a multipart widebody aerodynamic kit which holds the new fenders , redesigned bumpers , vents in the hood , carbon fiber diffuser and wing package . Now to own the world 's the fastest production coupe , be ready to empty your pockets at $ 477,500 .

© John J. Kim/Chicago Tribune/TNS A police detective inspects bullet casings at the scene of a double shooting on the 8700 block of South Sangamon Street Saturday , June 18 , 2016 , in Chicago .
CHICAGO — Chicago recorded its 300th homicide this weekend and tallied six others over a 60-hour period that saw 55 people shot , 13 fatally , from Friday afternoon through early Monday morning .
So far this year , close to 1,800 people have been shot across the city and more than 200 of those wounded have died from their wounds , according to records kept by the Chicago Tribune . A total of 306 people have been killed this year , by shooting , stabbing or other means .
A 3-year-old boy was among the wounded who survived the weekend shootings . Police said he 's in critical condition . The 3-year-old was shot in the right shoulder near East 61st Street and South Kimbark Avenue in the Woodlawn neighborhood at 6:15 p.m. Sunday , police said . The boy was in a car seat when an unknown attacker fired shots at the car , police said . People in the vehicle managed to get the boy to University of Chicago Medical Center . They were then transferred to Comer Children 's Hospital in critical condition .
Five people were fatally shot and nine others were hurt between Friday afternoon and Saturday morning . Four of the fatalities occurred in seven hours . The fatalities included a 16-year-old boy who was killed in West Englewood about 9:05 p.m. Friday . They were in the front passenger seat of a car driving through an alley in the 6500 block of South Hamilton Avenue when two males came up and fired shots , according to police .
At least 28 people were wounded , three fatally , in shootings from 8:30 a.m. Saturday to 4:30 a.m. Sunday , the equivalent of somebody shot every 43 minutes . One fatal shooting occurred during a possible murder-suicide in Hyde Park about 9:50 a.m. Saturday , police said . Police responded to the 1400 block of East 54th Street for a well-being check and found a 65-year-old woman with a gunshot wound to the head . A man , 73 , also was found shot in the head .
Five more people were killed and seven others , including the 3-year-old boy , were wounded from Sunday afternoon to early Monday . One of the fatalities Sunday was a 21-year-old man shot with “ possibly an AK-47 ” assault rifle in the Back of the Yards neighborhood , according to police . Police initially said the victim was 17 . The 21-year-old , who the Cook County medical examiner 's office said was Salvador Suarez , was walking east in the 1700 block of West 46th Street around 1:30 p.m. when a light-colored , four-door Saturn pulled up and fired shots with a “ high-powered semi-automatic weapon , ” striking the victim as they attempted to run , said Eugene Roy , chief of detectives for the Chicago police .
Suarez lived in the 4500 block of South Hermitage Avenue , according to the medical examiner 's office . Police are investigating whether the rifle has been used in any other shootings . The victim was pronounced dead on the scene , and the shooting was believed to be gang related , Roy said .
A Chicago police officer also shot and wounded a male who allegedly pointed gun at them near Humboldt Park on Sunday evening . The male suspect , whose age was not immediately available , was shot in the lower extremities , and they were listed in serious-but-stable condition at Stroger Hospital .
Nearly 40 House Democrats defied President Obama and helped the Republican majority pass a bill Friday that lets Americans keep , for one year , health plans that do not comply with Obamacare .
The defections from 39 members of Mr. Obama 's party highlighted the pressure on Congress to help people who lost coverage because of the president 's signature law , as balky websites keep a veil over alternative plans and pressure mounts on the Democrat-led Senate to forge a remedy .
“ Let 's face it , millions of people right now have a cancelled policy , ” Rep. Ron Barber , Arizona Democrat , said before voting for the Keep Your Health Plan Act .
The House passed the bill , 261 to 157 , despite a veto threat from Mr. Obama and objections from Democrats who said the legislation was an insidious attempt to rot the Affordable Care Act from the inside out .
Four Republicans voted against the bill , perhaps because it could be viewed as an attempt to smooth over Mr. Obama 's controversial reforms .
Rep. Fred Upton , Michigan Republican , offered the bill at the height of furor over Mr. Obama 's oft-repeated promise that people who liked their health plans could keep them . Millions of Americans received cancellation notices because their plans did not meet the health care law 's coverage requirements , forcing the president to apologize as vulnerable Democrats scrambled to find a legislative solution .
Rampant glitches on the HealthCare.gov website — a federal portal that connects 36 states with plans under Obamcare — have intensified the problem , because people losing their policies can not explore their options .
Mr. Barber said some Arizonans are “ beside themselves . ”
“ Because by December 31 they do n't have health coverage , and they ca n't get on the exchange to find out what 's available , ” they told reporters .
Mr. Obama announced an administrative remedy on Thursday that permits insurers to offer a one-year renewal to people who hold noncompliant plans , and Senate Democrats are pushing legislation that would let existing enrollees hold onto their plans indefinitely .
The Republican-led bill goes further , allowing new enrollees to gain current health plans that do not comply with Obamacare .
Democratic opponents of the bill said the GOP offered a hocus-pocus fix that amounts to yet another attempt to repeal Mr. Obama 's signature law .
“ It basically allows them to sell low-quality 2013 plans all through 2014 , nothing else , ” Rep. Frank Pallone , New Jersey Democrat , said .
Rep. Jim McGovern , Massachusetts Democrat , deemed it a “ colossal waste of time . ”
The White House said Mr. Obama would veto the House bill because it would likely increase the number of people with barebones plans , undermining Obamacare 's attempts to offer better protections through state-based insurance markets .
If too many young and healthy people keep noncompliant plans , a high proportion of sicker consumers on the exchanges — people with preexisting conditions can no longer be denied — would cause premiums to rise and spoil Mr. Obama 's overhaul .
“ The Administration supports policies that allow people to keep the health plans that they have , ” the White House said in a statement of administration policy . “ But , policies that reverse the progress made to extend quality , affordable coverage to millions of uninsured , hardworking , middle class families are not the solution . ”
The House voted shortly before Mr. Obama met with insurance company executives at the White House .
The president made no mention of their renewal proposal in remarks before the meeting . Instead , they said they would be “ brainstorming ” ways to make Americans aware of their coverage options .
“ Because of choice and competition , a whole lot of Americans who 've always seen health insurance out of reach are going to be in a position to purchase it , ” they said .
But Mr. Obama 's administrative decision has some state insurance commissioners worried . The logistics of grabbing back people who received cancellation notices are murky , they said , and it may prevent customers from contributing to a robust exchange in their respective states .
Rep. John Fleming , Louisiana Republican , said Mr. Obama 's fix “ really only offers political cover for Democrats . It does n't really do anything substantial . ”
They said the Upton bill is a step in the right direction , but they are working on legislation that lets Americans “ meet the individual mandate as long as you purchase insurance that you like that you 're comfortable with . ”
“ What I 'd like to do is actually put in effect rules and regulation and laws that actually allow that [ individual ] market to come back together again , ” they said , an idea that would surely roil Mr. Obama 's plans to build balanced exchanges through their law .
GOP lawmakers insisted they like to scrap the whole law , despite their vote to amend Obamacare 's problems .
“ It is merely to stop the bleeding , ” Rep. Michael Burgess , Texas Republican , said .

The first rule of thumb in the football media major news conference handbook is to take attendance , and there was definitely a new face on board worth noticing when the B.C . Lions named Ed Hervey general manager while retaining Wally Buono as coach Thursday .
Once Hervey and Buono took several minutes explaining exactly how things are going to work in an arrangement that on the surface seemed a tad different , the concept started to make sense .
Not sharing the stage at the podium in the dressing room but looking quite bummed , however , was the guy who many thought was being groomed for the job that was given to Hervey . Geroy Simon has admitted on numerous occasions they wanted to follow the path of their former CFL receiving colleague , making no bones about the fact they wanted to be named Buono 's successor .
Now , he 'll have to wait to find out their fate , as will personnel director Neil McEvoy , who also was an understudy to Buono and how is behind Hervey , who cut their managerial teeth in player procurement with the Edmonton Eskimos .
Also not sharing the floor , as has been the case now for several years , was the owner . It was David Braley who Buono repeatedly called out , as the Lions season ended , to give a disillusioned fan base their vision of the way forward . Braley was nowhere to be seen .
Braley sent out a letter to season ticket holders this month suggesting there will be changes , but remains in the background , in charge of a franchise that may have Hervey in charge for only one season but perhaps longer . Asked why neither Braley nor vice-chairperson Dennis Skulsky were present for the unveiling Thursday , Buono said they were told the Hervey announcement was not an appropriate venue for discussing the future .
Also on hand were a handful of coaches predictably eager to discover whether they would have a job with the Lions in a month or two , including defensive assistants Mark Washington , Robin Ross and Chris Tormey .
After it was over , Buono confirmed they have given permission for the Montreal Alouettes to speak with Washington , Marcel Bellefeuille and Khari Jones , and said allowing them to talk represented a ‘ two-way street ' , a clear sign last year 's staff will not remain intact .
Also not present was a retired Lions receiver who could possibly find themselves with a place in the organization after they were the subject of lengthy interview with Braley , who spent several days in Surrey this month .
Marco Iannuzzi made no secret of their desire to find a place for their financial acumen in a football setting , and for nearly three hours sat with the owner and Skulsky outlining their vision for a team that needs to hit the refresh button .
But the first sight of Hervey in Lions colors , given that their pending hire had not been a topic of discussion whatsoever throughout Grey Cup week , took some time to digest , much as was the case when Mike Benevides first showed up as defensive coordinator of the Eskimos as one who once bled orange .
Hervey ca n't help but be different in their approach than the man in charge of the Lions the last 15 years on a variety of fronts . Up until they had no alternative last season just to fill out a roster , Buono avoided free agency .
Hervey has approached free agency differently , almost right from their 2013 debut as Edmonton general manager , in which they produced a Grey Cup winner in three seasons . Some already suggested that hiring Hervey means the Lions could be in line to sign Edmonton quarterback James Franklin , who could become the free agent flavour of the month should they reach the open market in February .
Hervey will win some Lions fans over instantly with their view that a top priority in their new job will be to strengthen the line of scrimmage .
“ My philosophy is to build teams inside out ; start with offensive and defensive lines , ” they said . “ You wo n't have any success if you ca n't protect the quarterback . You start with the offensive line first then you got to the opposing team 's quarterback There 's gon na be some movement but were gon na be aggressive to make sure we have to the strongest offensive and defensive lines in this league . ”
The bigger question which will remain unanswered for awhile is how the Lions will operate with Buono no longer in charge of football operations , the area they said for years required singular governance .
When Benevides was in charge for three seasons , and during the one year when Jeff Tedford was in charge , players were unsure whether the guy calling the shots had a whistle or watched practice from a distance .
That wo n't be a problem with Hervey , a self-admitted introvert , who 'll likely will find it quite comfortable in the shadows . Buono , on the other hand , will figure out the composition of their coaching staff , undergo January back surgery , then head for their Phoenix dacha to watch the transition unfold with their visiting grandkids from a distance .
It 's not an ideal transition . But if you think of Buono as the late Bob Ackles , who was Buono 's sounding board when they arrived in 2003 to run the Lions , it 's a pretty good start .
Last week , the president of the Family Division of the High Court , Sir James Munby , made headlines when they called for greater transparency in the family courts . Munby described the ‘ pressing need ' to open the courts to public scrutiny , saying that , following the end of capital punishment , ‘ the powers of the family court were among the most drastic that any judge in any jurisdiction is ever empowered to make ' .
Munby is right . The powers of the family courts are truly draconian . The court has a broad range of powers to break up allegedly ‘ troubled ' families , often under Kafkaesque conditions . Applications can be made without families being present , judgements can be passed in secret , and injunctions placed on reporting some or all of the court 's proceedings . Munby 's remarks follow a series of judgments this year in which less senior judges in the family courts have been similarly scathing of the veil of secrecy under which they are able to function . But while Munby 's judgement was described as a ‘ landmark ' moment in the movement towards a more open family-justice system , the truth is significantly less optimistic . We know that Munby has form for peddling a rather diluted definition of ‘ transparency ' in family proceedings . In July , they issued draft guidelines titled ‘ Transparency in the Family Courts and Court of Protection ' . These guidelines suggested that greater transparency could be achieved by introducing a presumption in favour of publicising family-court judgements , unless there existed compelling reasons not to publish . And that was about it .
The guidelines rather missed the point . They said nothing about the power of the family court to continue functioning in secret if ‘ compelling ' reasons could be found . It is hardly a ringing endorsement of open justice to place the power for deciding whether a hearing goes public in the hands of the presiding judge . The guidelines said nothing about the possibility that local authorities would remain immune from scrutiny in the event that a judge decided that proceedings should be made anonymous . In fact , we can not rely on Munby to truly open up the family courts because the mechanism for maintaining their secrecy is found in legislation , not in common law . Judges have no power to alter statute and are loath to make any remarks that could be deemed to be attempting to do so . Munby 's comments , that judges should exercise their powers of anonymity only in the face of ‘ compelling ' reasons , were roughly in line with what they had already said in their guidelines . When it comes to the family courts , the only people with real power to open them up are those with the power to change legislation : our elected representatives .
Sadly , the Lib-Con coalition government has chosen a different focus in its reforms of the family courts : speeding up the proceedings for taking children into care . Earlier this year , the Ministry of Justice declared its intention to shorten the average time taken for care cases to be concluded from 56 weeks to 26 weeks . This echoed calls from the children 's charity Barnardo 's , which in 2010 criticised delays in having children taken into care and called for a limit of 30 weeks for the length of proceedings . Rather than seriously rewriting the statute book to create a more open family-court system , the government seems more interested in making it easier to chuck allegedly ‘ damaged ' kids into care . While they are powerless to effect real change , Munby is right that the most draconian of the state 's powers must be exercised in public . But we , the public , should demand more . There should be no ‘ compelling reason ' allowing the courts and local authorities to break up families in secret . Perhaps even more important than the ability of the media to report the judgements is their ability to scrutinise the process through which these judgements are reached . If we want this level of transparency and openness in the family courts , we would be unwise to rely on the unelected judiciary , who will only ever advocate change within the confines of the law as it stands .
For some strange reason , werewolves are the one monster genre that has n't seen the explosion that other horror creatures , like zombies or vampires , have received . However , it seems that they 're making a bit of a comeback and aiming to make a stand for themselves .
Enter Lucas Birnie 's Were-Wool , which is currently on Kickstarter . The film is being pitched as a horror comedy along the lines of An American Werewolf in London meets Slither . As they put it , it 's “ …an independent horror parody loaded with love , laughter , lycanthropy , and a hefty helping of practical gore and creature effects . ”
Below is a concept teaser as well as the synopsis .
Synopsis :
Max Pemberton is your average everyday shmuck who has had to give up on their aspirations and settle into a more practical lifestyle in the rural town of Lafontaine with their long-time girlfriend and local veterinarian , Sarah Ackerman .

MCD chief Denis Desmond has announced that Oxegen will return this summer after taking a one-year hiatus in 2012 . Not only that , it will be abridged to a two-day festival instead of three , as has been the case in previous years . It will also be moved from its traditional July slot to the weekend of the 3rd and 4th of August .
The Irish Examiner 's Gordon Deegan reports that the Oxegen line-up will be announced in late February .
Meanwhile , MCD produced profits last year despite suffering a 22 % decline in ticket sales to a total of €2.1 million . Desmond stated that Westlife 's two farewell concerts at Croke Park and Madonna 's performance at the Aviva were the concert promoter 's two biggest earners of the year .
Addressing the reason as to why Oxegen has been cut by a third , Mr Desmond was quoted as saying that the overheads , such as policing and insurance costs , are extremely high and intimated that certain cost-cutting measures had to be addressed to ensure Oxegen 's viability as a festival .
Meanwhile , it should be noted that Indiependence and Castlepalooza are both scheduled to take place over the same August Bank Holiday weekend . We ca n't help but wonder if Oxegen 's choice of date will directly impact the sales for these lower-budget festivals .
David Bronstein
Played two not so good games . The first there is nothing good to say about . The second I played well out of the opening in a Sicilian Najdorf , then my opponent went for a Bronstein-like-sac ( made me think of this game between Bronstein and Najdorf from 1954 : http : //www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame ? gid=1033887 )
However , it was not working as well for my opponent as it did for Bronstein , and I had a great position after the sac . In a position where I had to calculate between two moves I missed an easy tactic and went from winning to losing . Not the best session .

by Abigail Gilmore , Director of the Centre for Arts Management and Cultural Policy , Institute for Cultural Practices , University of Manchester
The announcement before Christmas by Newcastle City Council to axe all of its funding to city arts groups , as part of £150m budget reduction , led to much vocal protest . Petitions were raised and articles and blogposts corralled the public to protect the cultural life of the city . The concerned voices of arts infrastructure in Newcastle and Gateshead were joined by luminaries such as Billy Elliot writer Lee Hall , soap actor Jill Halfpenny and rock stars Sting , Mark Knopfler and Brian Ferry . This week , the decision has been softened as a new proposal for funding arts organisations has found £600k to fill the £1.15m hole – following intervention from Harriet Harman , and behind-doors negotiation by the Arts Council with the local authority .
Early on in the period of New Austerity , Manchester signalled its intention to buck the trend of local authorities by investing in its cultural infrastructure , through major capital development plans including Home ( the new Library Theatre and Cornerhouse amalgamation ) . Investment in the Central Library renovations and in revenue funding for the new National Football Museum take place against a background of service delivery savings of £109m in 2011/12 rising to £170m in 2012/13 . Elsewhere , the Whitworth Art Gallery have begun their major capital development and other venues such as Contact Theatre are hoping to attract investment for building improvements as well as continue fund-raising for outreach and engagement work .
Behind these high profile investments , lie other less newsworthy stories . The reorganisation of music education provision as part of the National Music Plan , perhaps the coalition Government 's most defined area of explicit cultural policy making , has resulted in not one but two music education ‘ hubs ' for the city-region ( one for the Manchester City Council footprint and the other for the remaining authorities ) , albeit as part of a 27 % overall funding reduction to music services nation-wide . Development and investment across art-forms in the AGMA authorities has been hit by waves of local authority reorganisations and restructuring , and although there is a sub-regional strategic arts fund , obtaining investment is dependent on the capacity of arts organisations and artists to work closely with local authority officers to achieve an increasingly disproportionate amount economic impact as part of their measurable instrumental outcomes . Libraries , museums services and local authority-run heritage attractions are all subject to the increasing competition for diminishing budgets and led by an inherently shrinking capacity to defend or champion , let alone manage and fund-raise .
So for those working in the arts and cultural sector in Manchester , Salford and the other authorities in the Greater Manchester conurbation the context for engaging people as audiences and participants in their work is quite clear . But what of the other recipients of these urban cultural policies ? How do these changes play out at ‘ community ' level , outside of city-centres , in neighbourhoods and localities which are ill-defined by national policy frameworks ? Are they recognisable in their impact on people 's daily lives or do they remain the conceit of a metropolitan arts elite , who are ultimately more concerned with rationalising their own existence ?
From ballet to bread-making
Data from national statistics suggest that participating in arts , cultural and leisure activities has a place in the majority of people 's lives , if not on a daily basis . Taking Part statistics find nearly 80 % ‘ engage in the arts ' at least once a year , and levels of museum and gallery visiting have according to these metrics risen by 10 % over the survey 's lifetime to over half the population . Similar numbers take part in active sports . Library and archive visits have decreased , reflecting changing patterns of use and consumption , and undermining arguments to keep libraries open . Taking Part does not reveal local patterns of participation however , or show whether these patterns are related to particular policy infrastructure , investments or developments . Furthermore surveys of this type are based on shared understanding of what constitutes arts and cultural activity , which is primarily ordered around formal ‘ offers ' which are often venue- and institution-based . They can not reveal much at all about participation taking place in communities , or what is means to participants in the context of their everyday lives .
A new research project lead by Manchester and involving co-investigators from four universities and from the cultural sector , in collaboration with a wide range of policy stakeholders . Understanding Everyday Participation – Articulating Cultural Value is a five-year research project funded by the Arts and Humanities Research Council , part of their Connected Communities : Cultures and Creative Economies programme . The project is led by Dr. Andrew Miles , ESRC Centre for Research on Socio-Cultural Change and involves an interdisciplinary team of researchers based at universities of Manchester , Leicester , Warwick and Exeter .
The project argues that orthodox models of culture and the creative economy are based on a narrow definition of participation : one that captures engagement with traditional institutions such as museums and galleries but overlooks more informal activities such as community festivals and hobbies . The project aims to paint a broader picture of how people make their lives through culture and in particular how communities are formed and connected through participation . Fieldwork research will be taking place in villages , towns and cities in England and Scotland , beginning with the case study site of Broughton , East Salford and Cheetham , North Manchester , from Spring 2013 .
The research focuses on participation as a ‘ situated ' process , with ‘ community ' and ‘ place ' as central logics in the governance of culture , as a critical engagement with the Bourdieusan conceptualisation of cultural capital and its role in the reproduction of social structures . It will bring together evidence from historical analyses , survey data and qualitative research to understand how people participate in culture in their everyday lives and the value they attach to that participation . The empirical work has been devised to embrace different geographies of participation and the communities which are articulated , connected and reproduced within these ‘ eco-systems ' .
The Manchester city-region eco-system is characterised by Manchester 's rebranding as the ‘ original modern city ' , which draws on its history of civic engagement paralleled by investment in built creative and cultural infrastructure , alongside Salford 's more recent renaissance in the regenerated Quays . It is not expected that these same characterisations will be upheld in the fieldwork sites of near-city centre Broughton and Cheetham , despite their geographical proximity to the heart of the cities ' creative infrastructures . The mixed methods research aims to see how these places and their cultural economies are constituted through ‘ everyday participation ' to radically re-evaluate the relationship between participation and cultural value . So , rather than measuring or analysing levels of engagement with recognised and legitimate cultural infrastructure – of Salford Quays , MediaCityUK or Manchester City Centre – the study proposes participation within communities as a source for articulating alternative understandings of value leading to a broader , more nuanced appreciation of ‘ creative economies ' .
In studying the situated practices of everyday lives in Northern towns , it re-treads the territory of Savage , Bagnall & Longhurst and Taylor , Evans & Fraser . The forms of participation which we expect to encounter may reflect the composition and the histories of these fieldwork sites , The demographics of the two bordering areas include high levels of benefit claimants and ‘ NEET ' school-leavers , rich textured histories of immigration , great cultural and linguistic diversity , but a narrow ( ing ) range of public institutions – comprising libraries , churches , housing associations and lack of shared ‘ neutral ' space . We will be hearing about what people do , eat , make , say , contend and ignore in order to produce their lives , and working with communities , policymakers and stakeholders to articulate the research findings in meaningful and productive ways , to enrich knowledge of these eco-systems and their cultures of participation .

The Minnesota Wild learned a valuable lesson last season in that you can never have enough organizational depth in goal . Between Josh Harding battling complications from multiple sclerosis to Niklas Backstrom 's knee injury to Darcy Kuemper 's concussion , general manager Chuck Fletcher kept busy making sure Rob Laurie or Paul Deutsch were n't needed to actually get in a game for once .
With training camp opening this week , the crease issues facing the Wild were even further complicated with news on Wednesday that Harding suffered an ankle injury that would keep them out of the lineup for months , according to Bob McKenzie .
RFA Darcy Kuemper is currently in a contract squabble with the club and has already played the dreaded KHL card , leaving Mike Yeo with only Backstrom and John Curry . Camp has n't even started and the frustration is setting in for the Wild head coach .

From the Star Tribune :
“ You make plans over the summer . I mean , my staff , we 've been making plans on who 's practicing , what practices we 're going to have , who 's playing in the exhibition games and this was under the assumption we would have Kuemps and Hards and obviously things have changed dramatically .
“ We 've gone from talking about three goalies to sitting here talking about one ( Backstrom ) . I put on the cool face last year pretending we were n't frustrated about [ our goaltending issues ] , but we 're not even Day One into camp and we 're already talking about it . ”
Yeo and Fletcher were planning to meet with Harding on Wednesday to find out exactly what happened . According to Mike Russo , `` ... there was apparently some kind of incident or altercation with a teammate . '' Oh . Boy .
[ Yahoo Sports Fantasy Hockey : It 's time to join a league today ! ]

Harding 's injury opens the door for two things now : Fletcher gives in to Kuemper 's one-year , one-way contract demand ( Minnesota wants two years , with the first a two-way deal ) or they go back to Ilya Bryzgalov , who , according to Russo , he 's already been in contact with .
Tim Thomas , Martin Brodeur and Tomas Vokoun are other options still on the market if Fletcher wants to stockpile for the season .
UPDATE : The Wild confirm that Harding has a fractured foot and is out `` indefinitely . ''

As U.S. political and media leaders prepare for military strikes against Syria , the parallels to the lead-up to the war with Iraq should give us pause . Weapons of mass destruction , we are told , are being used by a cruel Middle Eastern despot against their own people . A military strike is inevitable , media voices say ; we must respond with missiles and bombs . The arguments sound all too familiar .
Meanwhile , weapons inspectors from the United Nations are on the ground investigating evidence of chemical weapons . But U.S. and European leaders are looking at an immediate strike anyway—although Britain 's Labor Party , still smarting from popular opposition to its leading role in the invasion of Iraq , has successfully pressed for a hold on military action until the results of the U.N. investigation are in .
There are a great many differences between circumstances in Syria and Iraq , of course . Nonetheless , critics warn that , much as it did in Iraq , a military incursion here could have disastrous consequences . Here are 11 reasons the United States should stay clear of military action :
1 . We do n't actually know who is behind the chemical weapons attack . An attack employing chemical weapons took place in the suburbs of Damascus on August 21 and killed 355 people , according to Doctors Without Borders . Obama administration officials say the attack was carried out by the Syrian regime , but Institute for Policy Studies analyst Phyllis Bennis points out we have n't actually been given evidence that this is the case . And , while it 's unlikely that the opposition was behind the attack , NPR has pointed out that the rebels have an incentive to use such weapons to trigger outside intervention and end the stalemate they 've been stuck in since late 2011 .
2 . A military strike would be illegal under the U.S. Constitution and the War Powers Resolution . U.S. military attacks can only be carried out by an act of Congress , unless there is national emergency created by a direct attack upon the United States . The fact that Congress has adjourned does n't change that . “ There is no provision in the Constitution or the War Powers Resolution for a ‘ recess war , ' ” says Robert Naiman , writer for Just Foreign Policy . If it was a true emergency , Congress could be called into session to pass a declaration of war .
3 . It would violate international law , too . Syria has not attacked the United States , and there is no U.N. Security Council authorization for a strike on Syria . It would n't be the first time the United States has violated international law , but doing it again adds to a damaging precedent and contributes to a lawless world .
4 . The American people oppose it . Sixty percent of Americans oppose intervention in Syria , according to a recent Reuters poll . Just nine percent support intervention . Even if the use of chemical weapons is proven , just 25 percent of Americans would support intervention .
5 . Violence begets violence . According to Stephen Zunes , chair of Middle Eastern Studies at the University of San Francisco , military interventions actually worsen and lengthen violence in the short term . “ Countries whose dictatorships are overthrown by armed groups … are far more likely to turn into new dictatorships , often accompanied by ongoing violence and factionalism , ” Zunes says in an article in Foreign Policy in Focus . In the long term , they write , interventions only reduce violence if they are impartial , which would certainly not be the case in any upcoming conflict in Syria .
6 . Foreign intervention will deepen nationalist support for the Syrian Baath Party and the Assad regime . Zunes also reports that hundreds of members of the Syrian Baath Party , a key source of support for Assad , have left the party in outrage over the regime 's killing of nonviolent protesters . But , they say , “ few defections could be expected if foreigners suddenly attacked the country. ” U.S. intervention would play into the hands of the Syrian regime , triggering an outpouring of nationalist support for Damascus . The same thing happened in 1983-84 following U.S. Navy air attacks on Syrian positions in Lebanon , they say , and in 2008 after U.S. army commando raids in eastern Syria .
7 . There are no logical targets . Bombing stockpiles of chemical weapons would be untenable , since many would release poison gases into densely populated neighborhoods , according to Zunes . And there are too many ways of delivering chemical weapons—planes , missiles , mortars , and so on—to eliminate all of them .
8 . It will be impossible to control who benefits from Western interventionamong the rebels . The Pentagon estimates that there are between 800 and 1,200 rebel groups currently active in Syria , according to USA Today . Among them are ones with avowed affiliations with Al Qaeda , Jabhat al-Nusra , and other groups the United States considers to be terrorists . While the House Intelligence Committee has said it 's ready to accept the risk of providing weapons to such groups , a look at the Iraq and Afghanistan shows how such plans can easily unravel .
9 . Civilians will be killed and maimed . Policy analyst Phyllis Bennis points out the obvious : Strike with bombs and missiles , and , whatever your intent , civilians with no involvement in the conflict—including children and the elderly—will be harmed .
10 . There is no apparent exit strategy . Once we are involved , it is unclear how we will extract ourselves from a massive , ugly civil conflict that could spread to involve nearby countries such as Lebanon , Israel , and Iran .
11 . Yes , there is a better way . Tried , true , and boring though it may be , diplomacy often works . As Bennis told Democracy Now ! this week , Syria has become a venue for a war between the United States and Russia , and between Iran and an allied United States and Israel .
What 's needed , they say , are peace talks involving not only the parties who are fighting , but their backers as well . We need “ all the forces on the two sides coming together to talk , ” they say , “ rather than fighting to the last Syrian child , to resolve these wars . ”
Cape Town - All Blacks coach Steve Hansen will not disparage the Springboks , despite their side bullying them in recent times .
CLICK : To support South Africa 's Rugby World Cup 2023 bid
The All Blacks have won their last three games against their old rivals in convincing fashion - 41-13 in Christchurch , 57-15 in Durban and 57-0 in Albany .
That 's a combined scoreline of 155-28 but Hansen does not feel the Springboks were as poor as the scorelines suggested in those games .
The New Zealand coach was speaking after naming their side for Saturday 's Rugby Championship Test at Newlands .
`` We 've said that after each game ( that ) I do n't think the scoreboard actually reflects what 's happened on the park . We 've had to work really hard , ” Hansen was quoted as saying on the Stuff.co.nz website .
“ We know we 'll be playing a proud Springbok side which will be determined to rectify what happened in Albany . ”
According to Hansen their squad has settled well in Cape Town this week after a trip from Argentina where they beat Los Pumas last weekend .
“ Our preparation has been different because of the need to recover well from all the travel . This has meant that there 's been less time on the park and an even greater emphasis than normal on the mental side of our preparation . As always , getting real clarity of our roles and how we want to play has been key , '' they told the All Blacks ' official website .
Saturday 's Test kicks off at 17:05 .

The Cincinnati Bengals appear to have completed hiring the bulk of their coaching staff for next season , which means they can now really focus on free agency beginning in just over a month .
4:00 p.m. EST on March 1 is the deadline for clubs to designate franchise or transition players , but it does n't look like there 's a good chance the Bengals use the tag .
Wide receiver Marvin Jones quietly caught a career-high 65 passes for 816 yards to go with four touchdowns this past season .
Jones did so while often being the third or fourth option in the Bengals ' offense , so there 's no telling what they could do as the No . 2 or even top pass-catcher for a team . That is , if one of the other 31 teams in the NFL think Jones is someone they want to offer a big contract to this offseason .
Spotrac did a projection of how they see Jones ' next contract working out .
Marvin Jones , CIN
Calculated : 4 years , $ 22M ( $ 5.5M AAV )
Likely : 4 years , $ 20M ( $ 5M AAV )
Jones has flown under the radar behind A.J . Green and to some degree Mohamed Sanu 's shadows over their past four years in Cincy . But when targeted he 's been extremely reliable , including reeling in 70 % of their opportunities in 2015 . They scored 10 TDs in 2013 before missing all of 2014 with injury . They potentially head to free agency as the second best available WR .
A contract paying out $ 5 million annually is far from No . 1 receiver money , especially with the salary cap set to be around $ 154 million this offseason .
And as Spotrac points out , receivers of the same caliber do n't always get deals even close to each other . Here 's a look at the deals four similar receivers received in recent years , per Spotrac .
PLAYER LENGTH VALUE AVG . SALARY AGE WHEN SIGNED Golden Tate 5 $ 31,000,000 $ 6,200,000 25 Torrey Smith 5 $ 40,000,000 $ 8,000,000 26 Riley Cooper 5 $ 22,500,000 $ 4,500,000 26 Brandon LaFell 3 $ 9,000,000 $ 3,000,000 27 AVERAGES 4.5 $ 25,625,000 $ 5,694,444 26
Of those four , I would compare Jones ' level of play to that of Golden Tate . Like Jones , Tate has spent most of their career as either a No . 2 pass-catcher , or a No . 1 guy in a run-heavy offense ( as was the case when they were in Seattle ) . That 's why Tate has just one season with more than 898 yards receiving in their six years in the NFL .
But then you see a guy like Riley Cooper , who has done far less ( 21 grabs for 327 yards and 2 scores in 2015 ) getting a deal like they did . Teams will overpay for guys they want , and no team may be a better example of that than the Cleveland Browns .
Just this past offseason , the Browns signed Dwayne Bowe to a two-year , $ 13 million contract with a $ 3.5 million signing bonus and $ 9 million in guarantees . Bowe went on to catch a whopping five passes for 53 yards , and was a healthy scratch in many games this season . That means , they earned $ 900,000 per catch in 2015 .
Oh , and did I mention Hue Jackson is Cleveland 's head coach now ? You can bet he 'd love nothing more than to bring Jones with them and give that offense a reliable pass-catcher . And as Spotrac wrote , Jones may end up being the second-best receiver to hit free agency this offseason , meaning the chances of them being overpaid by another team looking to make a splash only increase .
That 's why the Bengals should be worried , but also be smart about re-signing Jones this offseason . While he 's a valuable commodity , they do n't need to break the bank for them with guys like George Iloka , Reggie Nelson and Adam Jones also set to hit the open market .
That does n't even include the 2017 free agency class , which will see Andrew Whitworth , Kevin Zeitler , Dre Kirkpatrick , Giovani Bernard and Shawn Williams have their contracts expire . If the Bengals overpay for Jones , it could cost them another key player down the road .
The good news is , the Bengals have a projected $ 30 million in cap space this offseason , whereas the Browns have just $ 17 million . That means Cincy can easily offer Jones that four-year deal worth around $ 22 million that Spotrac is projecting .
In the end , I do think the Bengals will offer Jones a deal close to that amount , but the key will be what other teams , including Cleveland , end up offering him .

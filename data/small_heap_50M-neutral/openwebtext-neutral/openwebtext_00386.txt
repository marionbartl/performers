I am running for reelection to the Senate . Lots more to do : ending gun violence , combating climate change , access to healthcare . I 'm all in ! — Dianne Feinstein ( @ DianneFeinstein ) October 9 , 2017
Feinstein , who is 84 , has been tight-lipped for months over whether they would seek a fifth term .

Asked on Sunday if they would run , they declined to answer , telling NBC 's `` Meet the Press '' that they were `` close '' to a decision .
`` You are going to find out about that very shortly , '' Feinstein said . But they appeared to hint that they were preparing to announce a decision to seek reelection .
Asked about a poll that half of California voters do n't think they should run , they added : `` Oh look . There are polls and then there are polls . ''
`` I 've got things to fight for . I 'm in a position where I can be effective , and hopefully that means something to California , '' they said .
A Public Policy Institute of California survey released late last month found that roughly half of voters believe Feinstein should n't seek another term .
Feinstein has come under fire from liberals who argue they have n't done enough to block President Trump 's nominees as the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee .
They also got pushback during a town hall earlier this year when they noted that they do n't support a government-run health-care system , often known as single-payer .
Rep. Ro Khanna ( D-Calif. ) , while stressing that they had no plans to run against Feinstein , said they are “ out of touch with the grassroots of our party on economic policy and foreign policy . ”
“ The fact that the establishment is rallying around their re-election shows that DC insiders continue to privilege protecting one of their own over the voters ' concerns , ” Khanna said .
Feinstein could face a primary challenge in the race , which political handicappers rank as solidly Democratic . Joseph Sanberg , a financial entrepreneur , and Kevin de León , California 's state senate president pro tem , have both been floated as potential challengers .
Environmental activist Tom Steyer , who has been coy about their 2018 plans , also told the Los Angeles Times that they were “ not ruling anything out ” in the wake of Feinstein 's announcement that they would run for reelection .
Meanwhile , California Secretary of State Alex Padilla — viewed as a potential successor if Feinstein retired — quickly offered an endorsement , saying they `` has delivered '' for the state .
`` At a time when so much we hold dear is under attack , we need them in the US Senate . I stand with her , '' they said in a tweet .
Fellow California Sen. Kamala Harris Kamala Devi HarrisSanders : 'Damn right ' I 'll make the large corporations pay 'fair share of taxes ' Warren Buffett : I would support Bloomberg if they ran for president Kamala Harris hits Trump on Fourth of July tweet : 'It 's America 's birthday , not their birthday ' MORE ( D ) offered a quick endorsement for Feinstein , saying they are `` thankful '' that she 's running again .
`` What Californians get from Dianne is someone who sticks to their principles and achieves results regardless of powerful opponents , from the assault weapons ban to the CIA torture report . We are better off with their leadership and I look forward to continuing to fight together for California in the Senate , '' they said in a statement on Facebook .
Twente 2 – 0 PSV : The champions retake the Eredivisie lead
In the most anticipated match of the Eredivisie season so far , reigning champions Twente beat league leaders PSV 2-0 to leapfrog them in the standings and retake the lead for the first time since last November . Squad depth , tactical flexibility and the return of superstar Bryan Ruiz provide vital elements in this enthralling performance .
PSV 's issues
In tactical terms , both teams are very consistent . PSV consequently apply a solid 4-2-3-1 system that draws heavily on the creative input of wingers Lens and Dszudszak . In midfield both Engelaar and Hutchinson play a conservative short passing game that does not appeal that much in terms of creativity and bright moments , but it proves highly effective in terms of controlling possession and providing defensive cover .
The Achilles heel of PSV 's formation this season has certainly been the striker area . Having none of their four potential central strikers sticking above the rest from the start of the season on , Rutten has struggled in this area from early on . Initially , Markus Berg , on a season-long loan from HSV did not fullfil expectations in terms of goal scoring . Later on , Koevermans was provided with a short run of games , but they are generally deemed more of a strong target man , able to open even games in a late substitute role rather than starting from the kick-off .
Some months into the season Jonathan Reis returned from Brazil , having overcome personal problems as well as their cocaine addiction . They firmly claimed the first team spot with a series of convincing performance , but was unfortunately injured during the Roda game and is out for the season with ligamental knee problems . Finally , Holland Under-21 international Genero Zeefuik made some useful substitute contributions , but was not yet able to step into the shoes of the first team starting role .
Against Twente , Rutten did n't have much of a choice , with Koevermans and Reis out , and they started Markus Berg . One-time Holland international Otman Bakkal replaced the suspended Ola Toivonen in the advanced midfielder role . Otherwise , PSV was able to field their preferred starting eleven .
Twente 's stability
Despite having faced serious injury problems themselves , Twente 's season has been a quite stable one . Their 4-3-3 formation , finally re-adopted by Michel Preud'homme after a short switch to the 4-2-3-1 earlier this season , is characterized by stability too . The midfield three of Janssen , Brama and Landzaat play a narrow controlled system with lots of movement in possession . Brama plays the most conservative role , generally man-marking the opposing advanced midfielder , Bakkal in this case . Landzaat is the most advanced man , making well-timed runs from deep to arrive late in the box . Finally , Theo Janssen is the spin-doctor of Twente 's team , providing an excellent deep-lying playmaker role with the combination of their technical skills and vision .
In this match , tall striker Janko was still out with injury . Strong , but temperamental central defender Douglas suffers from a six match suspension and long-term injured full-back Tiendalli made their return to the pitch only in the closing minutes . But most importantly , Bryan Ruiz came back from their tough knee injury to put their mark on the game in a substitute role , allowing them just thirty minutes of match action , but a decisive role nonetheless .
The first half
Twente has a habit of starting their matches in a controlled conservative style and this game was no exception to that . PSV was allowed to dominate possession , but only slightly and Twente 's compact midfield three made it difficult for PSV to transfer the ball their central offensive players Bakkal and Berg . An early controversial incident shook up things as Lens cleared the ball of their own goal line using their left arm and a penalty and red card could and should have been awarded . Curiously , this allowed PSV a way back into the game , with Twente being most distracted by this moment .
Both formations were quite balanced , both in terms of quality and in terms of the formations . PSV 's double pivot and single offensive midfielder combined well with Twente 's midfield shape and both teams ' midfielder effectively cancelled each other out for quite some time in the first half . The difference was generally made in the striker role .
While Markus Berg plays a static lone striker role , looking to get on the end of moves and score goals , Twente 's Luuk de Jong uses more positional freedom , regularly dropping off into the midfield . This allowed Twente an extra man a time and it allowed their right winger , Emir Bajrami , to drift inside and get involved in a role generally performed by Bryan Ruiz .
On top of that , De Jong played a much better game than Berg did . In short , Twente used their striker well to complete midfield combinations , while PSV saw their striker miss two excellent first half scoring opportunities , a decisive factor during the first half .
The second half
The urgency of this game was much more expressed during the second half as both teams applied more pressure on their opponents . After Bajrami saw a low shot from outside the box pushed onto the post by Isaksson , PSV took the game to their opponents during the first fifteen minutes of the second half . Twente 's patience was tested here as they kept their calm , sitting back and limiting PSV 's goal scoring chances very well .
Twente definitely changed the game around at the hour mark . Superstar Bryan Ruiz ' appearance at the side line just before their entrance on the pitch electrified the stadium and they immediately made their appearance felt . Ruiz possesses excellent dribbling skills and controls the ball very well during their dribbles . After Berg spilt possession around the halfway line , Ruiz was allowed a short turn past PSV defender Marcelo who held onto them for the slightest of moments . Twente was awarded a penalty that Janssen converted .
Rutten is that much consequent in their 4-2-3-1 system that they did n't turn to a second striker beside Berg , even after conceding this second half goal . Instead they opted to remove Berg with twenty minutes of play left and brought young Genero Zeefuik to the pitch . Overall , PSV upped their stance and tried to force a way back into the match , but with Dszudszak and Lens unable to contribute Twente 's defence was never really tested .
Near the end of the game Twente took full advantage of a weak Dszudszak free kick to counter to a second goal . Theo Janssen picked the ball up in their own half and finished a long run with a delicious slightly off balance chip over Isaksson to score one of the best Eredivisie goals this season and to finish this very important game .
In the end
After winning away in Eindhoven , Twente managed a second victory of their Eredivisie direct title rivals to retake the lead . The tactical flexibility of their 4-3-3 was clearly demonstrated in this match . At times they patiently absorbed PSV 's pressing moments , like in the first fifteen minutes of both halves , without conceding more than a few goal scoring chances . And at times they moved forward in compact shape too , like their dominance around the hour mark .
Furthermore , they showed superior squad depth as both teams missed their preferred first choice striker today . Twente has the flexibility of advancing Luuk de Jong , who played an excellent link-up game in a false nine roles , while PSV missed Reis ' goal scoring instinct as Berg missed the opportunities to score a first half goal . Now having played both Twente and Ajax twice and not having scored a single goal in those four matches , PSV 's striker issues have been made very clear .
Although Twente retook the Eredivisie lead , the race is far from over . Twente plays Ajax away on the final day of the season with PSV visiting Groningen at the same time . Furthermore , PSV 's superior goal difference might give them the edge if things get really tight .

American photographer Johnny Joo hails from Ohio and has published a book , Empty Spaces , on America 's abandoned places . At just 24 years old , they began photographing abandoned spaces at just 16 years old . Fubiz recently shared their photographs of the abandoned J.N . Adams Memorial Hospital for tuberculosis patients in Perrysburg , New York off Lake Erie , south of Buffalo . What 's interesting about these photos , in addition to the abandoned nature which makes them visually fascinating , is how the architecture reflects so many of the medical beliefs of the time period .
Like we showed in the photographs from the abandoned Ellis Island hospital complex , it was believed that corners allowed disease to fester so there were only rounded corners in the hospital . You can see this in the rotunda space above , a stained glass dining hall .

Curved hallways were also a popular architectural practice in these types of hospitals at the time . According to The Kingston Lounge , curved hallways had two purposes . First , “ their curvature made it impossible to place beds in the connector hallways , which was a common practice at overcrowded hospitals of the era . At the same time , it allowed a greater level of supervision , as doctors and nurses could easily traverse the entire length of the complex , while orderlies and patients could be confined to a single ward . ”

The warp-around exterior porches were also part of the health effort , as it was believed that the fresh , country air would benefit the patients . Built between 1909 and 1912 , the campus was set on 649 acres of land with a hilltop view down to Lake Erie .

Like many historical sites like this , it 's amazing to discover that it was listed on the New York State Register of Historic Places in 1985 , and it 's eligible to be listed on the National Register of Historic Places . At some point , structures like this become abandoned beyond repair and so unstable they warrant demolition , sometimes the ideal result for building owners and governments who do not have or unwilling to find the funds for restoration .

Contestants in an 'ultimate ' game show with no rules forbidding rape or even murder are furious after the organiser claimed the entire project was a 'fake ' .
Hundreds of potential participants applied from around thew world to join the Hunger Games-style project living on a Siberian island facing threats from bears , wolves and minus 50 degree temperatures .
But now Russian entrepreneur Yevgeny Pyatkovsky , 39 , has claimed the show was a stunt , causing a furious backlash from would-be gamers from around the world who were ready to devote nine months of their lives to the 'online TV show ' .
'It was a fake to help my market research , ' they said , although there were claims they abandoned the idea after pressure from the Russian authorities .
Hundreds of potential participants applied from around thew world to take part in the bizarre Game2 : winter project . Pictured : An advertisement for the for 'game show '

They have promised to repay the tickets of any contestants who had bought air fares to Siberia expecting to start on the bizarre Game2 : winter project next month .
The project faced widespread criticism after a rule unveiled last year stated : 'Everything is allowed . Fighting , alcohol , murder , rape , smoking , anything . '
In March , they told the media : ' I am pretty sure there will be fights , and more .
'We are not scared of negative reaction if that happens either .... we will refuse any claim of participants even if they were to be killed or raped ...
'We will not intervene into relations between participants nor monitor their sexual life either , and our cameras will not be able to follow every move in every corner of the island .
'They are free to form any couple or union , and there are no limits or rules regarding sex .
'If a woman falls pregnant - and manages to carry the baby - that 's fine with us . '
Russian entrepreneur Yevgeny Pyatkovsky , 39 , has claimed the show was a stunt
They promised training in 'how to behave when you meet a wild bear ' on an island which they said they would festoon with 2,000 cameras offering 24/7 live footage on the web .
Now they have boasted that the critical coverage proved they were a marketing genius , but they have been clammed by would-be contestants ready to take part .
Dozens had been expecting to start within a few weeks .
Timur Akchurin , 28 , from Magadan , claimed the organiser had 'strengthened the image of Russia as an unpleasant and unattractive country ' .
Russians would be 'ashamed ' , they said . 'You are just a swindler . '
A large number of protests came from those hoping to take part and others who followed the expected launch .
Furious Yana Ivanova declared : ' I suggest the project continues with just one participant - Yevgeny .
Pyatkovsky 's comments sparked a furious backlash from would-be gamers from around the world who were ready to devote nine months of their lives to the 'online TV show '
'Let 's drop them somewhere in the taiga , stick a GoPro [ camera ] on their head , and put a tracker in their a * * to find their body later.It will be a great selling video . '
Mats Goldberg , from Sweden , said : ' I do n't like to be made to look a fool in such an arrogant way by Russian millionaire Yevgeney Pyatkovsky . '
Pavel Glotov , 56 , who had big support in online voting for participants , claimed the organiser was a 'swindler ' , saying they are 'upset ' , and that a 'worthy and beautiful ' idea was 'debased ' .
Fyodor Pavlov complained : 'Yevgeny you fooled us . How can I explain to my supporters that am as naive as a baby . '
But others believe Pyatkovsky pretended it was a fake idea only after failing to raise sufficient sponsorship to make it work .
Andrey Ryshkov told Pyatkovsky : 'It will not happen for one reason only - a lack of cash and sponsors .
'With these two , all other issues would be resolved very quickly . '
Pyatkovsky promised training in 'how to behave when you meet a wild bear ' on an island which they said they would festoon with 2,000 cameras offering 24/7 live footage on the web
Among those who had signed up for the project was Oksana Shiganova , 28 , from the Russian Arctic city of Murmansk , who said : ' I am a professional blonde , a girl who loves dresses , manicure and shopping .
' I love myself and will definitely not make it through the show without help . But this is what will make it so interesting to follow me . '
The show had attracted former special services officers and outdoor-loving travellers .

On May 12 , one of Shell 's subsea flow lines sprung a leak , and 88,200 gallons of crude oil spilled into the Gulf of Mexico . A Shell helicopter spotted the spill—at that point , roughly the size of Manhattan—floating about 90 miles south of Timbalier Island , Louisiana . By May 16 , just three days after cleanup began , Shell and the US Coast Guard declared the case closed . With no oil left on the surface to recover , and no known impacts to wildlife , there was n't much more they could do . Are they great at dealing with oil spills these days or what ?
Well , of course they are n't .
You probably have n't heard about this particular oil spill . It 's relatively small , falling 11,800 gallons short of the Coast Guard 's 100,000-gallon threshold for major spills . But that does n't mean it 's low-impact . Smaller leaks do n't just get less press : They get less regulatory oversight , less money for cleanup , and less scientific sampling to determine the spill 's environmental effects . And that 's big deal , because this is happening a lot . “ This Shell spill is just one of twenty plus we 've worked on in the last month , ” says Doug Helton , operations supervisor for the NOAA Emergency Response Division . “ We have dozens to hundreds of these events happening per year , but it 's only the huge ones that get talked about . ”
Importantly , even if the spill is high priority , the responsible party—Shell , BP , whoever—is responsible for reporting the spill volume estimate to the government . “ We investigate every spill , even if it 's 10 gallons , ” said Coast Guard Chief Petty Officer Bobby Nash . `` But there 's a dollar amount attached to a spill for the responsible party , and they 've usually got a pretty good idea of how much is flowing at any given time . We take their initial numbers as the worst case scenario . ”
Smaller leaks do n't just get less press : They get less regulatory oversight , less money for cleanup , and less scientific sampling to determine the spill 's environmental effects .
That 's basically like hiring a dingo to babysit your toddler . Fines against oil companies are levied per barrel spilled : $ 1,100 for negligence , and $ 4,300 if they 're found guilty of gross negligence . And a gross negligence suit is far less likely to happen if there is n't significant public interest or an official investigation . Neither of which will happen if the volume estimate was , say , just 11,800 gallons shy of a major spill designation . Not to say that Shell ( who declined to comment for this article ) intentionally underestimated the volume of this spill . But it certainly would be in any oil company 's financial interest—and power—to do just that * .

The Murky Science of Oil Spill Accounting
The environmental impacts of an oil spill vary hugely , beginning with what kind of oil was spilled . Type 1 , like highly volatile gasoline or jet fuel , will evaporate in a day or so . Not so with Type 3 or Type 4 medium and heavy oils—crudes , like the stuff spilled by Shell last month—which stick around and gum up whales ' blowholes .
Location is another huge factor determining response . NOAA 's Emergency Response Division does oceanographic modeling to see how the spill is going to behave . The agency 's major concerns are whether the spill will hit the shoreline , a fishery , or a protected area like a wildlife sanctuary . Open ocean spills get far less attention , even though they are far from benign .
Finally , the volume of oil spilled is a whole other kettle of greasy fish . Even impartial observers can have a hard time figuring out exactly how much is floating around . They attempt to do that with the Bonn Agreement Oil Appearance Code , which tells them how thick a spill is based on its ( For example , a rainbow sheen is only 0.3 to 5 micrometers thick , where a dark sludge indicates a spill that 's more than 200 micrometers ) . You can calculate a volume estimate from there . But doing math with swirly , diffusing colors is subjective stuff . And the Bonn Agreement only covers the oil that makes its way to the surface . “ If the oil is coming out under high pressure—think about putting your thumb on a garden hose—it 's going to be in smaller droplets , and it 'll stay suspended . It can take weeks to months to years to figure out how much was actually spilled , ” says Helton .
Even Small Spills Matter
Shell 's May spill was basically doomed to obscurity from the start : Ninety miles out into the ocean , 3,000 feet below the surface , and not creeping towards the shoreline nor the nearby Flower Garden Banks marine sanctuary . `` It comes back to the ability to provide evidence . If it happens down at the deep there 's no way to do that . Most independent watchdogs do n't have the resources to even get out there , '' says Scott Eustis , a coastal wetlands specialist at the Gulf Restoration Network . `` Even the federal government is struggling . ''
That creates problems on several levels . `` Because of the way the spill occurred and because of the lack of infrastructure , there was no scientific sampling at first , ” says Ian MacDonald , an oceanographer at Florida State University . “ So there 's no way to verify what the degree of impact or potential degree of injury to wildlife was. ” Few had the opportunity to corroborate or challenge Shell 's initial volume estimate—which may or may not be the result of a single flyby—and the weather conditions precluded analysis of satellite images .
Pity , because the few people outside Shell who did make it to the site came away deeply concerned . `` I was literally knee deep in oil for most of 2010 , and I learned from the best , '' says Jonathan Henderson , founder of environmental watchdog group Vanishing Earth , who flew out on May 14 . `` This sheen was a deep brown color , which is just raw crude oil . I was very skeptical that there was only 88,000 gallons out there . ''
It was the distance from shore—and the depth of the spill—that also allowed the Coast Guard and Shell to make statements that there were no known or no reported impacts to wildlife . `` Well , who the fuck is going to report it 90 miles out ? '' Henderson says . MacDonald , who made it to the sheen on the 15th , says they did witness impacted wildlife . `` We saw pelagic fish , some seabirds , a pod of porpoises , a beaked whale mother and calf surfacing in and out of the floating oil , schools of fish nearby under the oil , '' they say .
Beyond the environmental impact of this particular spill , scientists are worried about the cumulative effect of these under-reported spills—especially because methods for cleaning them up are still so limited . The dominant technique , surrounding the oil with booms and skimming it up , “ recovers maybe 20 percent of the oil on the surface , and often less than that , '' says Tim Donaghy , senior research scientist at Greenpeace . Booming and skimming the Shell spill recovered 84,000 gallons of oily water . But that still leaves unanswered exactly how much oil was out there to begin with . Well , maybe not totally unanswered , depending on who you choose to listen to .
* Even during the Deepwater Horizon disaster , BP was forced to quintuple its estimate of the wellhead 's daily flow rate from 1,000 barrels to 5,000 barrels—not because of a government investigation and reassessment , but because of satellite and radar data collected by a tiny , independent nonprofit called SkyTruth .

I have read through the first 81 pages of the Troopergate report ( pdf ) . ( If you want to cut to the chase , read the findings , p. 8 , and the explanation of the first finding , pp . 48-68 . ) The NYT summarizes :
`` Gov . Sarah Palin abused the powers of their office by pressuring subordinates to try to get their former brother-in-law , a state trooper , fired , an investigation by the Alaska Legislature has concluded . The inquiry found , however , that they were within their right to dismiss their public safety commissioner , Walt Monegan , who was the trooper 's boss . A 263-page report released by lawmakers in Alaska on Friday , found that Ms. Palin , the Republican vice-presidential nominee , had themselves exerted pressure to get Trooper Michael Wooten dismissed , as well as allowed their husband and subordinates to press for their firing , as a result of a divorce proceeding between them and Ms. Palin 's sister in 2005 . `` Such impermissible and repeated contacts , '' the report states , `` create conflicts of interests for subordinate employees who must choose to either please a superior or run the risk of facing that superior 's displeasure and the possible consequences of that displeasure . '' The report concludes that the action was a violation of the Alaska Executive Branch Ethics Act . ''
To my mind , what 's interesting about the report is completely independent of what one thinks of Trooper Wooten . If they did something wrong , there are legal remedies for that fact . It would , to my mind , be OK for Palin to ask someone to make sure that the investigation into their conduct had been thorough and fair , but it is not at all OK to try to use their power to strip them of their livelihood . If Sarah Palin and their husband thought they were a threat to their family , the right response to that would be to make sure that the people Wooten had threatened had security . ( In fact , the report finds that they cut back their security detail . ) It is not to try to take away their job , which would , if anything , make them more likely to hurt people , not less . And it is certainly not to fire Walt Monegan .
* * *
The Palins really seem to have had it in for Wooten . This was obvious before -- most people do n't try to get someone fired just for kicks -- but reading all the details makes it really clear . The report lists nine people whom Todd Palin contacted about Wooten ; two say that they had `` numerous conversations '' and `` 10-20x '' , respectively , and the report lists nine contacts with the other seven . Sarah Palin contacted Monegan three times and another person twice ; and their Chief of Staff , Commissioner of Administration , Attorney General , and Director of Boards and Commissions all contacted people about Wooten .
That 's a whole lot of contacts . Enough to make this claim by Governor Palin seem not just false , but absurd :
`` Governor Palin says , `` All I know what the facts are and what the truth is . And the truth is never was there any pressure put on Commissioner Monegan to hire or fire anybody . '' ''
It also makes it very hard to believe Palin 's claim that they only became aware in mid-August that people in their administration had contacted Monegan and others about Wooten . That might be true if all the contacts had come from Todd Palin . But the idea that they were unaware not just that their husband was calling people , but that their Chief of Staff , Commissioner of Administration , Attorney General , and Director of Boards and Commissions were doing so , defies belief .
Moreover , the Palins seem to have had access to a private investigator 's report on Wooten ( p. 18 ) . And Todd Palin called people on several occasions to inform them of something Wooten seems to have done wrong that , absent a whole lot of coincidences , they could only have known if they were having Wooten followed , or if they were themselves stalking Wooten . Once they called to say that Wooten , who had been injured , was riding their snowmobile , that they ( Palin ) had pictures , and that they `` thought there might be some workers ' compensation fraud issues . '' ( p . 29 . ) It turned out that Wooten had consulted with their doctor before going snowmobiling . Another time , Todd Palin called to say that Wooten had been seen dropping their kids off at school in a marked police vehicle . It turned out that Wooten had their supervisor 's permission to do so . ( p . 32 . ) It 's pretty strange .
Generally , the report makes it sound as though the Palins , especially Todd Palin , were just obsessed with Wooten , in a truly peculiar and creepy way .
In addition , both Palins treated their subordinates terribly . As I said above , I can understand wanting to make sure that the initial investigation of Wooten had been fair and thorough . If Sarah Palin had those concerns , it would have been fine for them to ask about them , provided they made it clear that they did not mean to pressure anyone . Both the Colonel in charge of the investigation and Monegan took the Palins ' initial inquiries in this way : as attempts to make sure that everything had been done right . And had the Palins stopped there , there would be no problem .
But they did n't . And it is absolutely not OK to go on calling people about it even after those people have made it clear that they can not do anything else , and that the Palins ' continued contacts were inappropriate .
Walt Monegan warned Palin about further contact several times . ( `` Monegan : And I said ma'am , I need you to keep an arm 's length at this -- on this issue . '' ( p. 28 ) ) When their various subordinates called them about Wooten , they told them that if Wooten ever sued , their attempts to talk to them would be discoverable as evidence , and might make both the State of Alaska and them personally liable in court . They were very , very clear about the need to back off , and the consequences of not doing so .
To my mind , you should not ask your subordinates to do something that violates the rules in the first place . But if , for some reason , you do , and your subordinates tell you , correctly , that they can not do it without violating the rules , and moreover that your continued efforts are exposing both you and them to legal liability , you back off . Leaving aside any unfairness to Wooten , this is just completely unfair to your subordinates .
Many of us have either been asked by a superior to do something illegal or wrong , or know someone who was . It 's a horrible position to be in : to be asked to choose between your job and morality or the law . A good boss will not put their subordinates in this position in the first place . But no boss who had a shred of decency , or who saw their subordinates as people and not as mere underlings , would keep pressing after their subordinates had made it clear that they did not want to do it , or that they were uncomfortable doing something that was morally or legally wrong .
People who do this are just petty tyrants . That 's especially true in this case , when the Palins went on pressing after their subordinates had made it clear that they were not just uncomfortable being asked to do this , but were being exposed to legal liability . Moreover , while I suppose there might be cases in which the stakes were high enough to justify this sort of behavior -- in which , say , I had to ask a subordinate to do something illegal in order to save the planet from annihilation -- doing it just to get your ex-brother-in-law fired is inexcusable .
* * *
This is , at bottom , a story about the rule of law , and the rules governing the exercise of political power . If you accept those rules , then you think that people should be hired or fired based on their job performance , not on whether or not you personally have it in for them . If they do something that actually merits firing , then they should be fired ; if not , not .
If you do n't accept the rule of law , you might think that taking political power allows you to take any kind of vengeance you want on anyone who crosses you . This includes not just your ex-brother-in-law , but perfectly good Public Safety Commissioners who do not do your bidding .
Not accepting those rules is wrong in its own right . The state has enormous power , and one of the things that keeps it in check is that public officials are expected not to use it to advance personal vendettas . Sarah and Todd Palin obviously disagree . This fact alone should disqualify them from high office .
But it 's also wrong because it prevents people from doing their actual jobs . Firing Monegan because they would n't fire Wooten obviously deprived Alaska of a perfectly good Public Safety Commissioner . But besides that , every minute that Sarah Palin 's staff spent talking to someone about Wooten , and every minute that Monegan and their subordinates had to spend listening to them , was a minute that they were not spending advancing the interests of the people of Alaska , who paid their salaries .
We pay public servants to advance our interests , not theirs . When we discover that someone has put their interests above ours , we should punish them , at least if we want to give them any incentive to do their jobs right . We should not reward bullies who try to use their power over their subordinates to advance their own agendas . And if this report is at all accurate , Sarah and Todd Palin are bullies .

Dating is a sick , sick disgusting game . It really is . I mean , in order of worst games , it goes something like : boxing , hockey , then dating .
There are two opposing sides with one clear winner and one obvious loser .
It 's a game of high stakes , both opponents going in knowing that there 's a high probability they will come out the other side wounded and beaten , if not bleeding out . It 's f * cking dangerous and you have to be insane to want to play .
But we 're a little insane , are n't we ? We all crave drama and high risk . We like to gamble , smoke and drink . We like to live life on the edge , so why not partake in one of the most dangerous games ? Why not throw yourself in the ring ?
Because even with the facts in front of you and the bodies lying mangled on the ground , there 's always that small chance you 'll win and take home all the glory .
So here 's how to play the game . The woman stands on one side , guarding their goal : sex . The man stands on the other side , guarding their goal : commitment .
Each player is not to let the other person score in his/her net . The first one who lets in a goal loses .
The rules that apply are such :
1 . You can not score in anyone else 's net during the game . 2 . There are no substitutions . 3 . You can not score more than once .
It 's pretty straightforward . If Tod is playing a game with Jane , they ca n't go score in Sally 's goal . Tod also ca n't switch Jane 's goal in the middle of the game to Sally 's goal and Tod ca n't score five times in Jane 's goal without at least texting goodbye .
Back when our parents used to play , if Tod wanted to have consistent sex , he 'd have to marry Jane . If Jane wanted a committed relationship , all they had to do was withhold sex .
Basically , Jane would play some damn good defense until Tod got bored and just let them score .
While the strategy does n't work in every case , it 's like a pick and roll -- a solid attempt has a high probability of working on a weaker team .
Over the years , however , the rules began to change as new developments were made . No longer is it the classic game of first to score , but a game of cat and mouse with some Russian roulette , and free range shooting on the side .
It 's like Tod picking up the puck in the middle of the game and throwing it into some girls net on a court five blocks down the street . Where 's the referee ? Where 's the foul ? Come on ! You must be joking !
Sorry , but I did n't see anything . There may as well be no referee , no spectators and no rules at all . It 's a free-for-all with men deciding they really do n't need to play with girls who wo n't let them win . They can go win in some other girl 's court .
There 's no dignity left to it , no class . When the second opponent gets tired , they or they can just quit before it 's officially a loss . Judging by the way the game 's been going lately , here 's our analysis of the way men and women now score on each other in 2014 .
How men score on women
There 's no denying the new lack of rules works in favor for the men 's side . With a very high winning streak since Instagram and Tinder came into play , they lead the league with a tremendous amount .
Their new tactics include falling back on texting when things get too close and playing very defense heavy . They 've added Instagram , Facebook and Snapchat to their defense and offense , making sure they are never letting their opponents too close to the net .
Along with a very solid defense , they 've been racking up goals in unprecedented amounts . Their new way of shooting is through multiple shot succession . They can take five or six shots at a time , sometimes scoring on two nets at one time .
Their leading scorer is Tinder who always comes through , even on a Tuesday . They 've even been showing up with some new fancy tricks lately , like direct messaging through Instagram and Twitter shout outs .
There 's also no age limit for men in this game . They do n't get ostracized or played out by 35 , but can stay in the game for as long as they can hack it .
They can choose to just stand there and wait for their opponents to forfeit or settle for a player who will let them score ... many times called `` a wait out . ''
The winning men will then find younger opponents to score on , choosing weaker and weaker players as they go through the rounds .
How women score on men
They do n't .

This morning , comments made by David Axelrod had pro-choicers in a fresh panic , just days after what felt like a broad-based victory on reproductive rights in the Komen/Planned Parenthood kerfuffle . `` We 're going to look for a way to move forward that both guarantees women that basic preventative care that they need and respects the prerogatives of religious institutions , '' said Axelrod .
They were talking about Catholic bishops who are furious that affiliated hospitals and universities ca n't deny their employees contraceptive coverage through their insurance plans -- never mind that actual churches are exempt , that this is coverage that in many cases these institutions already offer , for women and men who are already using contraception in violation of the church 's teachings . The New York Times , among others , interpreted this as a signal of retreat , leading with `` The White House may be open to compromising '' on the rule , which requires full coverage of contraceptives as preventive care under the Affordable Care Act .

Also today , pastor Joel Hunter , an evangelical minister whom the Washington Post described as `` a key White House adviser on faith issues , '' claimed that `` there are conversations right now to arrange a meeting to talk with folks about how this policy can be nuanced , '' as if the Department of Health and Human Services had n't already reviewed the formal complaints made by the Catholic bishops .
And yet there was Jay Carney in the White House press briefing today , asked by a reporter `` if there 's a debate within the administration about reconsidering , and you flatly said , no , the decision has been made . Does that absolutely remain the case , no reconsideration ? '' Carney replied , `` It does . The president is committed to making sure that all women have access to these important preventive services . '' ( Indeed , Barack Obama 's own campaign is still trumpeting the move as a signal accomplishment . )
But Carney also said , `` [ T ] he process going forward includes a transition period where this discussion will continue to see if there can be ways found that ensure that women get access to this — these preventive services and that those services are covered as they will be for all other women , and it also takes into account these religious concerns . ''
So what does all that vague signaling mean ? Has anything actually changed ? Judging by its public statements , the White House seems to think it can calm down the bishops ( and the pundits who buy the line that religious liberty is being trampled ) by floating words like `` nuance '' and making it sound like everyone 's going to emerge happy .
And there 's speculation , in the Washington Post and elsewhere , that it means looking at laws in Hawaii and in New York that require women at institutions that deny them birth control coverage to go directly to their insurers . This would be an academic distinction , and whether that roundabout compromise would even mollify the apparently small and noisy constituency actually worked up about this is another question . Contrary to a reporter 's assertion to Carney today , the new rule does not `` require [ religious institutions ] to pay for '' birth control . As Jonathan Cohn pointed out , under the U.S. system , even with employer contributions , `` you pay for your insurance through wages that your employers withholds and dumps into a health insurance fund on your behalf ... It 's really your money that 's paying for your health insurance , not your company 's . The only objection that ought to matter is yours . '' None of this has mattered so far .
Why are we still arguing about contraception in 2012 ? The Catholic bishops are free to make as many incendiary comments as they want , and they have , but that does n't mean that pundits should assume there 's a constituency beyond a bunch of celibate men and likely Republican voters that is actually going to be swayed by this . New polling on the topic shows , for example , that `` a 53 percent majority of Catholic voters ... favor the benefit , including fully 62 percent of Catholics who identify themselves as independents . ''

It 's also been striking how much the conversation on the right and in many mainstream media forums has been dominated by men arguing about how much of a right they have to deny access to contraception , the responsibility for which , in practice , still overwhelmingly falls on women . Of course , contraception access should also matter to men ( particularly if they 're men who have sex with women ) . But the male-dominated nature of this discussion has been different from the one we saw last week , where all over social media , male allies were visibly pushing back at the Komen foundation and speaking up for Planned Parenthood . It 's been more along the lines of Mark Halperin dutifully listening to Axelrod talk about the millions of women who would benefit from this policy and responding , in a rare moment of mildly apologetic self-awareness , `` I appreciate the substantive answer , I really do ... '' and asking whether the administration 's regard for public health considerations made for bad politics .
Last week , we heard so many stories , and rightfully so , about real women helped by Planned Parenthood or affected by breast cancer . This week 's discussions , driven in part by Mitt Romney trying to gain on the issue and the bishops ramping up their rhetoric , have been mostly about political gain and what a purportedly abstinent hierarchy of men thinks .
Instead , we should be talking about real women affected by this policy , like the unnamed Georgetown law student with polycystic ovarian syndrome featured in the Times , who lost an ovary after falling prey to the `` pro-life '' insurance compromises at their institution . Or why the millions of women who get their insurance through a Catholic institution and use birth control should be subject to different rules than their fellow citizens .
One Catholic bishop insisted , with no sense of irony whatsoever , that `` people of faith can not be made second-class citizens. ” Apparently women are another story .

LOS ANGELES—According to sources close to the sadly delusional man , a pathetic Hollywood local is under the impression that they are actually on the verge of receiving an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor . “ He mentioned to me recently that they thought their chances of being Oscar-nominated for a movie they were in this year were pretty good and I just thought , ‘ Oh my God , how pitiful is this ? This poor bastard actually thinks he 's got a shot at an Academy Award nomination , ' ” said an anonymous source of the heartbreakingly misguided man , who reports confirmed is so completely deluded that they genuinely believe there is “ buzz ” around their performance in the film , and that all of Hollywood not only knows him , but is talking about him . “ I mean , to be so clueless and so lacking in any kind of perspective or self-awareness that you actually think the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences is going to recognize your work with an Oscar nomination ? I just wanted to say to him , ‘ What , are you nuts ? That is never going to happen . ' I guess Hollywood is full of people like him , though : wishers and dreamers . It 's pretty sad. ” At press time , the man 's agent and manager were apparently just going to let the confused man believe their pitiful little hopes and dreams for the next couple of weeks before they are officially crushed forever on January 16th .

Shortly before Election Day last year , mailers went out to Texas voters featuring pictures of a Democratic congressional candidate and a rare species of spider , whose discovery had forced stoppage of an important highway construction project .
“ The same left-wing extremists who support Pete Gallego want more burdensome regulations that put the interests of spiders above our need to create more jobs , ” the flier declared , referring to discovery of the endangered Braken Bat Cave meshweaver . “ The best way to stop left-wing extremists from killing jobs is to vote against their hand-picked candidate Pete Gallego . ”
The group that put out the mailer , A Better America Now , reported to the Federal Election Commission it had spent about $ 65,000 for the mailer and TV advertising in the hard-fought race to represent Texas ' 23rd district .
But in a tax return recently filed with the IRS , the group claimed it did not spend any money at all on “ direct or indirect political campaign activities . ”
The tax return is signed under the penalty of perjury by the group 's president , Bob Portrie , and the accounting firm LBA Group . Neither responded to requests for comment .
We first reported on A Better America Now earlier this year , showing it had told the IRS in a 2011 application for nonprofit status that it did not plan to spend any money on elections . ( That document was sent to ProPublica last year by the IRS , even though the application was still pending and thus not supposed to be released . )
“ This type of inaccurate reporting by electioneering nonprofit groups has a long history , ” says Public Citizen 's Craig Holman , when asked about the group 's most recent filing . “ It is rooted in the fact that the IRS almost never holds these groups accountable for such false declarations . ”
A Better America Now was a bit player in the elections . But it 's also an example of the kind of increasingly common outside groups that inject anonymous money into political campaigns .
Such social welfare nonprofits are not supposed to have political campaign activity as their primary purpose — but the ambiguities around how the IRS measures such activity and how it screens the groups are at the center of the recent investigations of the IRS 's treatment of Tea Party groups .
ProPublica has documented how nonprofits that spent millions of dollars on ads in the 2010 elections failed to report or underreported that political spending to the IRS . The tax form that the groups is required to file with the IRS specifically asks for details on any campaign spending .
One of the curious things about A Better America Now is that , though the group spent money in a congressional and a state legislative race in southwest Texas , it is based a few miles off the beach near Jacksonville , Florida .
The president of A Better America Now , Portrie , is also the head of a consulting firm , the Fenwick Group . The two groups are listed at the same address . Fenwick 's website says it works with “ organizations across the healthcare , financial services , insurance , retail and investment sectors . ”
Portrie and Fenwick were also linked to ads run by another Florida-based social welfare nonprofit , America is Not Stupid , in last year 's U.S. Senate race in Montana . Ads by America is Not Stupid featured a talking baby complaining about alleged cuts to Medicare by President Obama , and referring to the baby 's stinking diaper .
In 2010 , the New York Times reported on links between the Fenwick Group and yet another politically active nonprofit , the Coalition to Protect Seniors . Ads by that group featured the same talking baby ad .
In last year 's race in Texas , which attracted a lot of outside spending on both sides , the Democrat , Gallego , prevailed over Republican incumbent Quico Canseco .
Their comic books have lost their core of good storytelling , and are instead pandering to social justice warriors and offering phony diversity pushes .
Marvel Comics is on a steep decline . For nearly two decades their sales have plummeted , as they 've flooded the stands with too many books and variant covers , killing the collector 's market .
In addition , Marvel has crippled the possibility of the impulse buy . A single , inexpensive pamphlet no longer tells a full story ; six or more issues are required to get a complete work . Their distribution is funneled through the monopolistic entity Diamond Comics , which only ships to an ever-decreasing number of boutique specialty shops . Marvel has also created almost no new heroes in years , still telling stories about the same characters that Stan Lee brought to life in the 1960s — more than 50 years later .
Even through all this , Marvel persisted . That is , until social justice warriors took over and dethroned them from their place of top-selling comics .
What Happened When SJWs Took Over Marvel
Marvel 's transition from fun superhero adventures to political shilling began in 2011 . Brian Michael Bendis , Portland resident and rabid left-wing writer , announced that they would be writing a “ half-black , half-Hispanic Spider-Man ” in a relaunch of the reboot version of Marvel they call the Ultimate Universe . The comic received an exorbitant amount of free media from the Huffington Post to USA Today , bringing Marvel Comics to the mass media 's attention for one of only a handful of times outside of major movie events .
The gimmick worked , bringing a comic that was lagging with sales of approximately 33,000 unit to more than 89,000 units—a bestseller by comic book standards . Those sales did not last , as their drive-by and rubbernecking readers proved to be fleeting . Today , the Miles Morales Spider-Man book has settled back in the 31,000 unit range , a nearly 10 percent drop from when the book last featured its traditional lead , Peter Parker .
A year later , Marvel went for marketing to the social justice crowd through clickbait news again , this time with the X-Men . They announced that they would have the first gay wedding in comics , and again received droves of media coverage , which propelled “ Astonishing X-Men ” from its lagging sales of approximately 31,000 units to over 82,000 units . “ Astonishing X-Men ” was cancelled a year later due to low sales .
Comic Book Fans Want Substance , Not Shilling
Marvel employed these gimmicks more frequently . Each time they would see a smaller sales boost . Each time the boost would n't last . Despite this , Marvel filled its editorial and writing slots with self-proclaimed social justice warriors , as many of its great talents left for creator-owned projects or DC Comics , Marvel 's main competitor . As late as last year , Marvel received headlines such as “ Marvel diversity shaking the comics world . ”
But as sure as the American voters rejected the all-but-given coronation of the first female president , who ran not much more than a Marvel-esque gimmick of their anatomical differences with past leaders , the American readership rejected Marvel 's political preaching through fantasy entertainment . The message from fans was simple : we want substance , not shilling .
ICv2 recently interviewed Marvel 's VP of Sales , David Gabriel , who said , “ What we heard was that people did n't want any more diversity . They did n't want female characters out there . That 's what we heard , whether we believe that or not . I do n't know that that 's really true , but that 's what we saw in sales. ” Gabriel was effectively denying any problem with the direction Marvel Comics is headed , downplaying the real reasons behind their terrible sales numbers . Even in failure , Marvel missed the point .
Marvel Fans Want Quality Storytelling Instead Of Gimmicks
Marvel 's quality of books and storytelling has dropped by significant measures . The gimmicks above come off as cheap tricks to push short-term sales . When used in every book in the Marvel line , those tactics become aggravating to readers who want a brief escape into a world of superheroes .
But there are other , more tangible quality differences to Marvel 's current work than in years past . There is less content both by depth of story and by page numbers than ever before . Almost every Marvel superhero that a reader would recognize from their childhood or the movies has been replaced by a minority knock-off , leaving the Marvel line unrecognizable . Anyone going into a comic shop looking to catch up on their favorite heroes would be turned off , and rightly so .
A comic book retailer in the San Francisco Bay Area voiced their frustration , saying Marvel went from 48 percent to 25 percent of their sales . Their shop and livelihood are at risk because of Marvel 's continued dedication to their shallow faux-diversity . If this type of cheap virtue signaling does n't work in San Francisco , what audience do they think they 're selling to ?
A Closer Look At Marvel 's Writers Helps Clear Things Up
Hearing the poor sales figures from a retailer prompted me to look into Marvel 's writers . Over a period of two weeks , I dug through the Twitter accounts of every current Marvel writer listed on marvel.com ‘ s new releases page , to see where they stood on politics . What I found would have been shocking , if I had n't already seen the extreme left-wing preaching posing as superhero adventures from their products . Even with that , the sheer lockstep and groupthink that these social media profiles display is unthinkable .
Out of 30 writers , every single one made bitter posts attacking President Trump and conservatives . There were no dissenters . Not one had a difference of opinion , not one even saw the sense in refraining from posting about politics . Here are a few gems from their tolerant , open-minded , diverse writers :
Nick Spencer ( Captain America ) : “ The media collapse of 2016 is a spectacular thing to watch . Suddenly we 're pretending Trump supporters are n't racist ? ” Dan Slott ( The Amazing Spider-Man ) : “ If a Trump political rival ( DNC or RNC ) did this , Their nickname for them would n't be Lyin ' or Crooked , it 'd be Nazi. ” Greg Pak ( Incredible Hulk ) : “ Racism , sexism , religious intolerance & homophobia enable violence & murder by letting people think of other humans as less than human . ”
The message is clear : anyone who supports Trump is not welcome at Marvel Comics . Conservatives will be met with a litany of insults that one would expect to find on anonymous internet message boards , not in a professional corporate setting . Marvel , judging by their comics and their words of their employees , demonstrates unadulterated hatred for the half of the country that voted for the President of the United States .
As a business , one would think that a company the size of Marvel would keep their customers ' demographics in mind . But as we 've seen above , a large portion of their customer base has been told they 're not wanted . Their problem : the new , diverse crowd they desire did n't come into comic shops to purchase their books to replace those they shunned .
None Of Marvel 's Current Writers Are Christian
However , in their tweet , Mr. Pak did bring up another good point : what of religious tolerance ?
I ran a Twitter search again , this time to investigate Marvel 's religious leanings . Marvel has writers who profess to be atheist , Jewish , and they even have a Muslim writer . Most writers , eager to speak out on their left-wing politics , do n't talk about their religion at all .
I did find one oddity : out of the entire group , I did not find one writer that openly professed Christianity . On the contrary , many of the writers made comments mocking Christians or the Bible . It begs the question : does Marvel hold a latent religious intolerance toward Christians ? Based on this research , it would appear so . I reached out to the Marvel writers listed above and Marvel Comics Editor-in-Chief , Axel Alonso , but they declined to comment .
Several Writers Say Marvel Has Blacklisted Them
Over the course of my research , several artists have spoken to me in private about Marvel 's business practices , stating their support for my efforts to expose the bigotry and intolerance in this company . These artists maintain that blackballing from those offices is standard practice . One such artist is Brett R. Smith , who used to have regular contract work at Marvel and D.C. comics . They worked as creative director , editor , and colorist of Peter Schweizer 's “ Clinton Cash . ”
“ They stopped returning my calls , ” they said .
Writer Chuck Dixon has sold millions of comics and created the infamous Batman villain , Bane . Even those credentials , they are intentionally overlooked for current comic work . “ I am blacklisted at Marvel and have been for 15 years , ” Dixon said . These days , they self-publish novels on Amazon , such as their most recent , “ Levon 's Kin. ” “ The effect has been direct on me , resulting in less potential work , less potential income . ”
Lack Of Cultural Diversity Is Actually Killing Marvel 's Sales
What 's apparent in these empirical observations about Marvel 's hiring practices is that the company does not desire legitimate diversity . This is why their so-called “ diverse ” comics ring so false , and why readers have stopped buying their books . Marvel only wants and espouses a single opinion—one of social justice and extreme left-wing pandering . The diversity they feign is skin-deep , without any real differentiation in character or voice . In geek terms , they are the Borg , and if you want to work in the comics industry , resistance is futile .
A leading comic news site , Comic Book Resources , wrote a recent headline , “ No , Diversity Did n't Kill Marvel 's Sales. ” This is true , but not because of the way it was framed in their article . The truth is that Marvel has no diversity of thought or culture , and as such , real diversity is not at fault for their low sales numbers . Marvel despises conservatives and Christians alike , and with that attitude , they can not have a diverse group of writers . Their lack of cultural diversity has fostered an environment of creative stagnation . That is what 's killing their sales .
Marvel Needs To Reject Groupthink , Not Embrace It
Marvel claims their ways are changing , but there 's been no evidence of a true culture shift in their hiring practices . When their over-politicizing first showed low sales figures toward the end of 2016 , Editor-in-Chief Axel Alonso said , “ we never lost sight of or classic characters . We always have a plan for each of them . In 2017 , a lot of those plans will be revealed . ”
Their words come across as spin for this failure , as if this were a planned arc to bring back Marvel Comics to its core of storytelling . However , real change must begin in the writers ' room , if it is to have more substance than their phony diversity push . If Marvel maintains the same group-think core of extreme leftists , we will continue to see a derth of creativity , resulting in further declining sales .
What 's needed is the voice of a few good writers who hold the core values of millions of Americans for Marvel 's rich tradition is to be restored . As a science fiction writer and fan myself , I hope Marvel gets their act together so that the those shunned by their blackballing practices can “ Make Mine Marvel ” once more .
Motherhood is the quintessential motherhood issue for politicians . But even the most family-friendly politician knows to tread carefully around that most emotive of motherhood issues : in vitro fertilization .

For a pro-family politician , it 's hard to be anti-in-vitro at voting time . But when post-election realities set in , it 's even harder to find the funding . IVF has become Ontario 's political perennial : Seeking re-election in 2007 , Dalton McGuinty made a campaign commitment to formally study IVF funding . As premier , they set up a citizens ' panel as promised — but had second thoughts , two years later , when its report called for funding in vitro .

Seeking re-election in 2014 , Kathleen Wynne has made a pre-campaign commitment to set up yet another panel on IVF funding . This time , McGuinty 's successor has promised to proceed with partial funding — in principle . Ontario would become only the second province , after Quebec , to pay for IVF . But the precise details wo n't be ready for another year — well after an expected spring election . In vitro fertilization is the political issue that refuses to die , reincarnated in every campaign . The woman in the middle of this motherhood issue has been Deb Matthews . As McGuinty 's health minister , Matthews firmly rejected public funding of IVF . They disputed the panel 's claim that any extra costs could be offset by savings if the money were made contingent on clinics implanting only single embryos ( multiple embryos lead to more twins or triplets with increased risks of medical complications that burden the system ) . Health economists persuaded Matthews that funding IVF was “ not as revenue neutral as I had hoped it would be — so it 's an additional cost , ” they told me three years ago . And too costly .
Now the health minister — who also happens to be co-chair of the Liberal re-election team — has had a change of heart . Last week at a daycare photo-op , they announced a new “ advisory body ” would figure out how to fund an estimated 4,000 women trying to get pregnant . Same health minister , several years of gestation . What changed , other than the election cycle ?

Matthews cites the rapid decline in multiple births after Quebec started funding IVF in 2010 ( hardly a surprise ) . Now Ontario is budgeting about $ 50 million a year ( initial estimates were closer to $ 85 million ) , and is banking on “ offsets ” from reduced multiple births to cover those costs . “ Health economists will have a very healthy debate about what the offsets are , ” Matthews told me this week , when reminded of what she 'd said three years ago . It 's a cost-benefit analysis : “ Can you , by funding IVF , reduce the multiple birth rate ? ” The question of how to reduce twins and triplets , and the resulting complications , is a good one . But is giving people money the only way to reduce multiple births ? If implanting two or three embryos is medically unsound , why does n't the health minister persuade — or compel — fertility clinics to end the practice ? Matthews does n't dispute that they could crack down on dubious multiple births . They just prefers the carrot over the stick , using financial incentives rather than regulatory measures to keep clinics in line . But is it the best use of public money at a time when the health care budget is approaching $ 50 billion a year , and consuming an ever-increasing share of the provincial budget — now about 42 per cent of program spending in Ontario ? Couples with fertility problems argue that it is a medical condition that merits state support no less than any other disease . Statistically , however , IVF compares poorly to most other medical procedures . In the U.K. , about one in three women under 35 will give birth in one cycle of IVF . For women aged 38-39 , it 's about 20 per cent . Ontario 's previous IVF panel recommended funding until age 42 , yet the success rate for women aged 40-42 is a mere 14 per cent . Those are low odds . Even if the Wynne government were to carry out its promise , the money wo n't stretch far : Ontario would only fund one cycle of IVF . Patients would still have to pay for the drug treatments , which can be a big part of the roughly $ 10,000 cost for each cycle — with some couples paying up to $ 50,000 as they keep trying . The IVF debate is always fraught for politicians . Yet one party leader who remains wary of public funding is Tory Leader Tim Hudak , who has spoken publicly about the challenges that couples face in childbearing . They and their wife just had their second child after trying for several years , but they have long believed that IVF is not the best use of public money . On this issue , he 's right .

Avenue Supermarts , the parent company of Indian retail chain D-Mart , listed on the bourses on March 21 . It made a blockbuster debut , the best in five years at least , according to data from PRIME Database , a capital markets information provider .
D-Mart 's shares opened at Rs604.4 a piece on March 21 . This is 102 % higher than the stock 's offer price—the price at which shares are first sold to investors during the initial public offering ( IPO ) —of Rs299 . Some subscribers had their investment almost double in value by the end of the opening day , a Moneycontrol analysis showed .
Sixty-nine companies have listed on stock exchanges in India since Jan. 01 , 2012 , and D-Mart 's gain on the day it got listed was the highest among them , data shows . The listing day gain is the percentage difference between the closing price of the stock on the first day and its offer price .
Such a performance has made D-Mart the most valuable listed retail chain in Asia 's third-largest economy . The family wealth of the company 's founder , 62-year-old stock-broking veteran Radhakishan Damani , has leapfrogged ; it is higher than that of other billionaire industrialists such as Anil Ambani , Ajay Piramal , and Adi Godrej . The value of the Damani family 's stake—some 82 % —in D-Mart is now worth $ 5 billion . Before the listing , Forbes had pegged it at $ 2.3 billion ( as of March 20 ) .
Damani founded D-Mart in 2002 with a single store , and it is today one of India 's most profitable retail businesses with 118 outlets . In financial year 2016 , it recorded a net profit of Rs321.2 crore on revenues of Rs8,606 crore . Damani 's early business decisions like focusing on value retail and investing in real estate , have helped D-mart emerge as a star in India 's $ 600-billion retail market .
On March 22 , a day after the debut , the stock was trading at Rs642.88 per share as of 12:51 pm on the BSE , 0.28 % higher than its previous close .

Some outdoor advertising companies regard municipal fines for illegal signs as just another cost of doing business . New York City is suggesting they think again . The cost has now reached six figures .
Building Blocks How the city looks and feels — and why it got that way . On Friday , the Landmarks Preservation Commission and the Law Department announced that the city had collected $ 225,000 , a record fine , for the illegal installation of wall signs in a historic district without permission from the landmarks agency .
The payment settled a lawsuit that the city filed last year against a sign company , Colossal Media Group , and the owners of 598 Broadway , a 12-story building with temptingly large blank walls overlooking busy Houston Street , in the SoHo-Cast Iron Historic District .
“ This should be a message to companies that flagrantly disregard the city 's landmarks law , ” Melanie V. Sadok , assistant corporation counsel in the Law Department , was quoted as saying in the announcement . “ We will pursue violators , and , as this case shows , the outcome can be quite costly for them . ”
Through three executives — Adrian Moeller , Paul Lindahl and Jonathan Airis — Colossal also agreed to “ file complete applications , including color samples , to come into compliance with the landmarks law ” for signs at 343 Canal Street , 438 Broome Street , 59 Grand Street and 60 Grand Street .
Robert B. Tierney , the commission chairperson , was quoted in the announcement as saying , “ For nearly seven years , the defendants ignored the law , and installed more than 20 signs on the wall of a landmarked building without getting permits from the commission , even though they were well aware of the need to obtain them. ” The city identified the building 's owners as Zvi Mosery and Nat Mosery .
John Weiss/Landmarks Preservation Commission
David H. Singer , a lawyer for the owners of 598 Broadway , said in a telephone interview : “ My clients did n't put up any signs . My clients leased the side of the building . The signs were supposed to be put up legally. ” Mr. Singer added that sign prohibitions , by “ drying up a great source of income for landlords , ” would compel building owners to raise rents instead .
A telephone message left with a lawyer for Colossal was not returned . A clause in the settlement notes that it “ does not and shall not constitute an admission of liability by defendants . ”
The signs on the exposed wall at 598 Broadway are now gone . But there is still plenty of outdoor advertising around it . A vinyl wall sign and a free-standing billboard between Lafayette and Crosby Streets already existed in 2010 , when that block was added to the historic district , said Elisabeth de Bourbon , a spokesperson for the landmarks commission . They were therefore “ grandfathered ” in .
There are also hand-painted signs for the Hollister clothing store chain on the side of a six-story building at 600 Broadway , just below the signs that have been removed . Ms. de Bourbon explained the distinction in an e-mail : “ It 's mostly text , not images ; the color palette is restrained/limited ; the colors are in keeping with the painted wall signs historically found in the district ; it does not overwhelm the facade or streetscape ; has a border , and , most importantly the owner got a permit . ”

FREDERICK , MD — New details have emerged of the death of a mentally handicapped man , killed inside a movie theater in January while wearing police handcuffs . The official cause of death was asphyxiation , and an autopsy has revealed that the man suffered a peculiar injury — fractured throat cartilage — which one expert says could only have been caused by force of some kind . Force , which could have included a direct blow or manual strangulation . The officers still remain on the force , and many questions remain .
On January 12 , 2013 , Robert Ethan Saylor was watching “ Zero Dark Thirty ” inside the Westview Promenade theater in Frederick , MD . Saylor , age 26 , was born with Down Syndrome and had an IQ of 40 , and was in attendance to the theater with a caretaker .
At the end of the movie , Saylor had enjoyed the movie so much that they clapped . They wanted to watch it again . Theirs not understanding the concept of tickets , and the pair 's lack of money to purchase another viewing , left them in a dilemma .
Police were called to make sure that Saylor was removed from the theater unless they paid for a second ticket .
Disputing over the price of a movie ticket , police began engaging the pair and demanding more money .
“ I explained , ‘ Yes , we are having a little issue , I 'll handle it . We just have to be patient , ' ” the aide wrote in their statement . “ Then a sheriff came and said , ‘ Another show is starting . I have to go get them out . I explained Ethan is ( sic ) Down syndrome . ”
Their caretaker pleaded with police to “ wait it out , ” as they had no more money to pay for another ticket . They warned police that they could not handle being touched and would “ freak out . ”
Police ignored the aide 's request and began to get physical wth Saylor in order to place them in handcuffs . They wrestled with them as they writhed in pain and mental discomfort .
Several people heard the officers tell Saylor that they were going to jail , reported the Washington Post .
During the confrontation , 3 deputies fell into a heap on top of Saylor on an inclined ramp . The deputies placed three sets of handcuffs on him , and was laid face down for several minutes . Saylor suddenly grew quiet and unresponsive , prompting the deputies to perform CPR .
“ Next thing I know , there are I think three or four cops holding Ethan , trying to put them in handcuffs , ” the aide told authorities , according to Sheriff 's Department documents . “ I heard Ethan screaming , saying ‘ ouch , ' ‘ do n't touch me , ' ‘ get off ' and crying . Next thing I hear is nothing . ”
“ Mommy ! It hurt ! ” were their last words . They died of asphyxiation .
The death was ruled a homicide . The 3 deputies spent a month on paid vacation and were ultimately not charged with anything . They resumed full duties in March , the Washington Post reported .
“ Each of these professionals , devoted law enforcement officers , did what was necessary under the circumstances , and they did what their training dictated that they do , ” said the officers ' attorney Patrick J. McAndrew .
“ The deputies did nothing wrong , ” said Daniel Karp , another attorney for the sheriff 's office .
A Grand Jury heard the case and dismissed the officers , but the Saylor family 's attorney points out the lack of objectivity at the hearing , according to Your4State.com . The aide , nor any of the theater witnesses , were there to testify .
“ It was a homegrown investigation done by the Sheriff 's department on the Sheriff 's department by the law enforcement going to a Grand Jury , ” says Joseph Espo , the Saylor family 's attorney . “ It 's my understanding that the only witnesses [ at the Grand Jury ] were the investigating officer and the three deputies . ”
The fractured cartilage was shown to have occurred while Saylor was still with a heartbeat . “ It can be seen in a manual strangulation , ” said expert witness Dr. John Hunsaker to Your4State.com . “ But in and of itself , one would be difficult to diagnose without more information . And it can occur as a result of a direct blow . ”
The exact cause of the fracture is unknown and may never be known . But 3 deputies skirted through a biased Grand Jury and received several weeks of paid time off as their only reprimand for their unthinking enforcement techniques , lack of compassion , and ultimate killing of a handicapped man who idolized police .
UPDATE ( Feb. 2014 ) — Police Trained To Deal With Persons With Low IQ
Rather than discipline or criminal charges , the officers who strangled Ethan Saylor , along with two dozen other members of the Frederick County Sheriff 's Department have been sent to a 4-hour training class to learn how to interact with humans with intelligence lesser to their own .
Interestingly , neither Saylor 's mother nor the Sheriff were confident that the training would solve the problem .
“ I think education is always key to understanding , so [ the training ] could not have hurt , ” said Patti Saylor . “ Whether or not the people involved would have heeded the training they had , I ca n't comment on that . ”
Sheriff Charles A. Jenkins says they are pretty sure their deputies would have still killed Saylor even if they had this training earlier .
“ Based on what I 've seen and what I know about what happened at that theater , I truly , honestly do n't believe anything would have been different as to the unfortunate outcome . ”
The latest word is that the Justice Department is still looking into the incident , according to the Washington Post .

You know how you have browser-based games or listicles about your favorite celebrity breakups open in your browser window right now , but have mastered the art of alt+tabbing back to your spreadsheet when your supervisor walks by ? Well , according to a new study , you may just want to leave that session of Civ World up and running next time your supervisor hovers around your desk , because wasting time on the Internet may actually increase your productivity .
A report from the National University of Singapore claims that wasting time on the Internet is an important restorative function , which , if you have ever taken a break from , for example , studying or homework , should n't come as much of a surprise . At the annual Academy of Management meeting , researchers said that “ cyberloafing ” can mentally refresh workers better than chatting , texting , or sending personal emails . Oddly , the study also found that bosses who check up on what their employees are doing on the Internet too frequently actually cause their workers to mess around on the Internet more than if said workers had Internet freedom with less snooping .
Though the study may seem surprising at first , it actually makes perfect sense . Working for eight or ten hours straight will just drive a person crazy and want them to get their work done , rather than get it done well . So , next time you 're about to get fired for playing Heroes of Newerth or Elements at work , tell your boss you 're just taking one for the team and becoming a better employee .

The NHS in England is sending patients who are seriously ill with eating disorders to Scotland for treatment because chronic bed shortages mean they can not be cared for in England .
Vulnerable patients , mainly teenagers and young adults , are being taken hundreds of miles from their homes in order to receive residential care in Glasgow and near Edinburgh .
Mental health experts voiced deep concern about the trend and said it could damage patients ' chances of recovery , increase their sense of isolation through the separation from their families and even increase their risk of dying .
Eating disorders : what is treatment like where you live ? Read more
Doctors , eating disorders charities and patients have told the Guardian that the quality of care received by patients , some of whom are at risk of dying , is being compromised by the NHS in England having far too few beds to cope with the growing number of cases of anorexia , bulimia and other forms of psychiatric illness linked to eating habits .
“ I 've seen a rise in calls from people saying their children have been sent far away , miles away , to be looked after because there are either no services nearby or they are full ” , said Jane Smith , chief executive of Anorexia and Bulimia Care . “ This is a life-threatening situation for young people . People are in inpatient care because they are at risk of dying . They are in a very fragile , risky state . ”
Rebecca Doidge , 20 , from St Albans in Hertfordshire , spent six months in the Priory private hospital in Glasgow earlier this year because they were desperate for treatment and could not find anywhere else . The distance had negative side-effects , they said .
Despite being well looked after there , “ being sent so far away does compromise care ” , they said . “ The outcomes are going to be better if you can stay near home . It 's really hard to integrate back home or go to another environment when discharged if you are in a different country . It makes communication between those treating you in hospital and those at home difficult . ”
During their stay in the Priory , which has 25-30 beds , “ about seven of the people there were from Hertfordshire , ” they said . “ The number of English people there massively outnumbered Scots . ”
Anup Vyas 's stepdaughter has been receiving treatment for a rare eating disorder in Huntercombe private hospital in Livingston , near Edinburgh , since February . After previous stints in units in Watford , London and Colchester in Essex , the 17-year-old 's condition is so serious that “ now they are basically being kept alive in Scotland ” , said Vyas .
“ NHS England acknowledge that them being so far away is not ideal . Them brothers have n't visited them since June and no friends have gone up . Most people in the unit are from England , especially the north of England – places like York and Manchester. ” The family 's home is in Hemel Hempstead , 350 miles from Livingston .
The health secretary , Jeremy Hunt , criticised the practice as “ completely unacceptable ” . They recently said NHS children and adolescent mental health services were the NHS 's worst area of care .
“ It is clearly unacceptable for people to be sent hundreds of miles away for care at a time when they need the support of friends and family the most ” , they said . “ That 's why in April we committed to a national ambition to eliminate inappropriate out-of-area placements by 2020-21. ” Ministers had also earmarked £150m for enhanced services in community settings to help ensure that mental health problems in young people were tackled before their health worsens , they said .
NHS England , despite its professed commitment to openness , refused to say how many patients from England were receiving treatment for eating disorders in Scotland . Expanding the supply of specialist beds to treat people with those conditions would take time , it said .
“ It 's extremely distressing for parents to have a child who is so unwell that they require inpatient care , and it 's even worse when they ca n't easily visit their child because of long travel distances ” , said Sarah Brennan , chief executive of Young Minds . “ For many young people the distance from family and friends is one of their biggest fears when they are hospitalised . Being separated from loved ones does n't help with recovery and makes the stress of hospitalisation worse . ”
Dr Jon Goldin , a consultant psychiatrist in London specialising in children and adolescents , said they had heard of patients being moved long distances . “ But it should n't be happening , ” they said . “ It 's a concern . Patients should be treated nearby and should be in contact with family . They need support and it 's much harder to get that when families have to travel long distances .
“ Part of their recovery may involve therapy with their family , especially for children aged 14 and under. ” , said Goldin , who is also a spokesperson for the Royal College of Psychiatrists .
More young people were developing eating disorders , they said . Genetic factors , personality factors and socio-cultural factors , such as images in the media of models “ which glamorise thinness ” are among the many reasons for the trend , Goldin said .
A spokesperson for the Priory hospital in Glasgow said it took patients from all over the UK . “ The Priory hospital in Glasgow has a reputation for providing some of the highest standards of mental healthcare in the country , and has been given a ‘ very good ' rating by our regulator , Healthcare Improvement Scotland , for staffing , management , information to patients , and the environment it offers those we care for . As such , we support patients from across the UK and overseas . ”
A spokesperson for NHS England said : “ The NHS recently laid out very clear plans to expand staff and services for specialist eating disorders and other mental health problems , in order to tackle and eliminate distant out-of-area placements . Transformation wo n't happen overnight but work is under way to improve services for everyone and to make sure care is available at home or as close to home as possible when a patient needs more intensive therapy .
“ To help achieve this , the government has allocated a cumulative £1.4bn to children and young people 's mental health services over the next five years , and the new waiting time for eating disorder patients will ensure patients get better care more quickly . ”
Deputies arrested a Polk City woman for DUI on a horse in Lakeland on Thursday .
Donna Byrne , 53 , was riding the horse in the roadway on Combee Road , near North Crystal Lake Road when deputies arrived on scene .
Deputies said Byrne smelled like alcohol , had watery bloodshot eyes and was staggering .
A field sobriety test was conducted and they were arrested for DUI . Byrne was also charged with animal neglect for failing to provide proper protection to the horse . According to the affidavit , Byrne put the horse in jeopardy of being injured or killed .
Byrne blew a .157 and .161 BAC . A breath alcohol level of .08 is the legal limit in Florida .
`` Ms. Byrne was obviously not in any condition to be on the road . They not only put themselves and the horse in danger , but also anyone who was driving on the road , which is typically very busy '' , Grady Judd , Sheriff .
Polk County Sheriff 's Animal Control seized the horse and transported it to their livestock facility .
Byrne 's prior criminal history includes five felonies and ten misdemeanor charges , consisting of cruelty to animals , drug possession , probation violation , and criminal traffic .
Tuesday morning was a rough one for Bernie Sanders , but maybe an even rougher one for the people who helped make them a household name .
For many , the road to Sanders 's Monday speech at the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia stretched back nearly five years , to Zuccotti Park , when a motley collective of anarchists , labor organizers , and intellectuals sparked a nationwide movement when they decided to step outside the ordinary channels of dissent , pitch a tent , and Occupy Wall Street . The movement and its approach — social justice , economic fairness , civil disobedience , and an unwillingness to compromise with existing power structures — outlived the occupation , finding an unlikely voice and millions of new adherents in the insurgent primary candidacy of Bernie Sanders , senator from Vermont , who was elected as an independent and describes himself , without apology , as a democratic socialist . Sanders mounted a serious challenge to favorite Hillary Clinton for this year 's Democratic nomination , giving thousands of their young followers their first taste of what it feels like to participate in the American electoral system , and to win , taking more than 40 percent of the popular vote and winning 23 states outright .
That road turned sharply last night in Philadelphia , when Sanders took the stage at the Democratic National Convention and attempted to throw their weight behind Clinton , the presumptive nominee . Unlike Sen. Ted Cruz , the Tea Party purist who did not endorse Donald Trump in Cleveland , Sanders chose to fully ally themselves with their party 's nominee . They did so at the risk of offending the activist core who helped give them a seat at the table in the first place .
After several large street protests in the afternoon , the convention floor was mostly orderly last night , though a few delegates wore blue tape over their mouths . The pro-Bernie booing and chanting that provoked some awkward onstage ad-libbing from Sen. Al Franken and comedian Sarah Silverman midway through the program had mostly settled down by the time Sanders themselves took the stage . There was a 60-person Occupy-style “ mic check ” after the convention adjourned . After midnight , on Packer Avenue , there were shouts of “ Never Hillary ! ” as two Sanders supporters made their way back toward the city on foot .
“ Maybe it was a mistake to build our movement around Bernie , ” said Justine Tunney , a software engineer . “ It empowered them to funnel that will into Hillary . ”
“ We need a movement that truly represents the will of the people , ” they added . “ We need a popular movement . Populism is great . How is it a controversial idea that government should care about the will of the people ? There are two populist candidates : Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump . The establishment has forced us into an impossible position by taking away one of those choices . What do they expect us to do ? Stay home ? ”
I asked Tunney whether I should interpret what they said as support for Trump . “ Not necessarily , ” they said . They declined to say what they would do if the election were held today . “ I 'm still coming to terms with the fact that Bernie probably is n't going to get the nomination , ” they said .
Tunney was eating lunch at a vegetarian restaurant in Center City with Micah White . White came up with the initial idea of Occupying Wall Street during their time at Adbusters , the Canadian anti-consumerist nonprofit . They have filed the paperwork to run for mayor of Nehalem , Oregon , the small town where they live with their wife and son . They told me that they do not generally vote in presidential elections , and does not plan to vote in November .
White seemed to put Sanders on a slightly lower pedestal than Tunney did . But like Tunney , they said that the endorsement of Clinton left them in a confusing position . “ It was a strategic mistake to focus on a single charismatic individual rather than build an actual movement , ” they added . White was also critical of Sanders using the word “ revolution. ” “ He is degrading the meaning of the word , ” White said . “ What he 's doing is n't revolutionary . Revolution is when you change the way power flows in a society . Bernie is rallying people behind a major establishment candidate who 's raised more money than any other candidate in the election . Their job now is to bring the far left into the political establishment . ”
Nevertheless , White had managed to slip Sanders a copy of their book , “ The End of Protest , ” that very morning . ( The book calls for activist movements to move beyond “ disruptive tactics ” and to come up with innovative new tactics that “ harness the creativity of people from across the political spectrum . ” )
Some believe that Sanders did right by their movement , bringing activists onto the convention floor and pushing the Democratic Party to reform its primary system . “ Bernie held onto their principles even when they went out of fashion and lived long enough to see them become popular again , ” my colleague Murtaza Hussain wrote last night .
But not everyone viewed the situation so optimistically . After lunch , I saw a man in their late 20s in a T-shirt marching toward City Hall . They carried a ragged red flag , the size of bedsheet , which was stapled to a long wooden pole . Their name was Scott Warren . They said that they were 27 years old and lives in Center City .
The red flag , they said , did not signify Communism , but something more personal . “ The flag means general dissent , ” they said . “ I picked it up at a march yesterday . I had my own sign . It said ‘ Syrian Children ' on it . The march was about not just the election but war , the environment , Black Lives Matter . And I do n't see enough people talking about the bombings going on in Syria , or the CIA-backed ‘ moderate ' rebels who are killing kids . Nobody is really talking about that . So I quickly made a little sign that said ‘ Syrian Children ' on it . The march started off at City Hall and it went all the way down to FDR Park , at Wells Fargo . It was like three thousand . Maybe ten or twenty thousand at its peak . But my sign fell apart in the rain . So now I have this flag . ”
I asked them again what the red flag meant .
“ I 'm not just going to walk down the street and pretend that nothing is wrong , ” they said. “ My putting the flag up means I 'm not happy . Things are bad . I mean , I think things are bad . ”
Warren said that they had volunteered for the Sanders campaign , the first they had ever been involved with . “ I phone banked , a little bit . I went to several marches in Philly . I came [ with ] money . Some . Not much . Just 'cause I 'm like , you know , income-low. ” They work at the Philadelphia Zoo , they said .
“ The DNC itself is a sham to me , ” they said . They accused the DNC of election fraud . As evidence , they cited recently released emails , discrepancies between exit polls and actual results , and “ collaboration between the media , or mainstream media , with the Hillary campaign along with the DNC . ”
As for Sanders 's endorsement : “ To me , I think they fear Trump . I fear everybody . You ca n't expect , voting for the lesser evil every four years , for things to get better . The lesser evil eventually becomes the greater evil . ”
Like Tunney , Warren declined to say whom they would choose between Trump and Clinton if the election were held today . Unlike with Tunney , I may not have asked them the question directly .
The Trump campaign has been making efforts to court disaffected Sanders supporters like Warren , appropriating rhetoric like “ rigged system , ” which originated with left-wing critiques of the two-party electoral process and which appeared in Sen. Elizabeth Warren 's Monday night speech .
Justin Molito , a union organizer from Connecticut and committed Sanders delegate , had been listening to Scott Warren 's words . Their convention credentials were adorned with buttons for Bernie and against the Trans-Pacific Partnership . They had come from an event organized by Working Families , an advocacy group focused on economic inequality , but swung by a delegate event at the Capital Grille on Broad to grab a free sandwich when Warren walked by with their red flag .
“ I 've yet to meet a Bernie Sanders supporter who would support Donald Trump , ” they said . “ I think it 's a bit of a media construct . That [ Trump ] is obviously not an option . I live in a state that 's likely not to be that close . But if I feel like I have to vote for Hillary Clinton to stop Donald Trump from becoming president , that 's what I 'll do . ”
After using their third round pick somewhat surprisingly on University of Miami tight end Clive Walford – giving them two pass-catchers selected in the first three rounds – the Raiders moved to address the offensive line in the 4th round by selecting their teammate , Jon Feliciano .
Feliciano was the second Miami Hurricane taken in a row by the Raiders , and the third ACC player in a row . The Raiders would add another ACC product in the 6th round ( Virginia 's Max Valles ) as well as two Florida Gators in linebacker Neiron Ball and receiver/returner Andre Debose .
The Raider coaching staff – which includes former Miami assistant Jethro Franklin and former Florida State assistant Sal Sunseri – was obviously heavily influential in these selections . Franklin was an important recruiter at Miami , and likely took runs at both Debose and Ball coming out of high school . Florida played against Miami once and Florida State ( where Sunseri was the DE 's coach ) last season , meaning each coach had seen them on the field as well .
These selections also showed that former Raider player Zack Crockett – who is the Raiders ' southeast area scout – has some major weight in the scouting department , as they likely did the principal scouting of seven of the Raiders ' ten draft selections . Here is what Crockett probably saw in Jon Feliciano :

Last week , we released v1.0.0 of our open-source apps Firepad and Firechat ! These are two great open-source modules built on top of Firebase that you can take and use in your own apps .
Firepad is a collaborative text editor . It lets you bring the features of Google Docs right into your app . Firepad can handle both code and rich text , and is currently being used in production by Atlassian , LiveMinutes , and CoderPad to name a few .
Firechat is a realtime chat app built with Firebase . Firechat 's features include multi-user / multi-room chat , flexible authentication , moderation , presence , private messaging , chat invitations and more . CBS is using Firebase to power the realtime chat for their Big Brother TV series .
Orginally we built both of these modules to showcase the realtime and collaborative power of Firebase , but they 've grown into full-featured , production-ready pieces of functionality . Both projects have reached the point where they 're stable , full-featured and well-documented , so we 've decided to officially tag them as 1.0 !
Here 's what 's new in the 1.0.0 releases :
Firepad 1.0.0
With help from the community , we 've added some highly-requested features and fixed many bugs over the past few months .
We added a headless mode for interacting with documents programmatically with no GUI ( e.g . from your backend server code ) . It can run in Node or in a browser . To use it from Node , just run npm install firepad , require the module , and add a headless instance of Firepad using the following code :
var Firepad = require ( 'firepad ' ) ; var headless = new Firepad.Headless ( ' ' ) ;
We 've made a number of API improvements to make writing apps using Firepad easier . For instance , there 's a new defaultText option to specify initial text to be loaded in Firepad , and there 's a new `` synced '' event to notify you when your changes have successfully been synced with Firebase so you can provide notice to the user . See the API docs for full details .
We 've also fixed many minor bugs and UI issues to make the collaborative editing as fluid and seamless as possible ! Firepad is now available on the Firebase CDN as well as Bower , making it even easier to include in your app .
Firechat 1.0.0
Our Firechat homepage is now hosted on Firebase Hosting . In addition to this , we 've improved the documentation , fixed bugs , and added warning messages to make development easier . Firechat now works well with other frameworks like Twitter Bootstrap , so you can customize the app 's default styling .
We 'd like to hear from you !

The San Antonio lawyer known as the `` DWI Dude '' and `` 420 Dude '' for their defense of clients charged with drunken-driving or marijuana possession has been charged by the FBI with conspiracy to commit money laundering and obstruction of justice in an alleged plot that scammed about $ 1.2 million from Colombian clients .
Jamie Balagia , a former Austin cop who ran for Texas Attorney General in 2014 , was arrested late last week in McKinney , near Dallas , and is being held without bond near there pending a bail hearing Thursday .

He 's accused , with an investigator and a South American lawyer , of trying to get up to $ 2 million out of the clients by allegedly telling them that some of the money would be used to bribe judges and prosecutors in their drug cases . Officials said no one was bribed .
Balagia , 56 , who is appointed to defend clients here in federal court , ran into legal trouble themselves two years ago when the State Bar 's disciplinary arm sued them for misconduct over allegations that they improperly kept $ 50,000 from a pair of clients in Amarillo .

On a toxic , fiery world designated as EM-8ER , also known as “ Ember , ” Gatestrider reaper teams encountered humanity 's first sentient xenomorph .
We know they call themselves the “ Tsihu. ” The reaper teams that endure their constant attacks have a more colorful name for them .
Our first contact has been anything but peaceful . It 's all gone to hell . Every mining operation , every excursion triggers more and more of these attacks by the Tsihu . Anybody who has ever tried to talk or reason with them has never had the chance to get more than a few words out before being slaughtered .
They have a language though . We hear the phrases “ Zha ryuon muon ” and “ Tasa hekita ” repeated often . Linguistics is on it . They think “ zha ” refers to loop , and “ muon ” some kind of fabric , or binding . “ Hekita ” seems to mean some kind of deterioration .
Is it war ? Not yet . If it were n't for the technological ruins and resources on EM-8ER , our reaper teams would have simply left . Instead , what we have here is an opportunity . The Tsihu are n't really * here * . They are phasing in and out in crackles of lightning and electricity , as well as much of the native xenomorphs . We think it 's temporal-as in these creatures are from another time . An earlier phase of the planet , perhaps , if you can believe the readings .
We need to keep a lid on it . For as long as we can . Every team here is in agreement . The riches and alien technology of this world would be enough to start again . Maybe give us enough edge to tell those Enshigi * bastards to fuck off .
But first we have to figure out what the hell the Tsihu really are , and how to beat em . They shapeshift . If they 're not in humanoid form shooting at us , they are suddenly morphing into huge creatures that are tearing our omniframes apart hand to hand . We think they go feral if they stay too long in “ beast ” mode . We 've seen some in chains and some kind of holographic tagging or restraints . These are always the most violent and destructive ones .
We need to claim as much of this planet as we can before word gets out , and build up the means to defend it . It 's all right here , everything we need .

Maps reveal details about fictional worlds . The maps provided in fantasy and science fiction stories – including fantasy and science fiction comics – help ground the story , giving readers a sense of the story 's setting and dynamics . For example , an examination of the U.S. presidential election map presented in the first issue of the DC Comics series Prez offers details about the story 's political landscape . The map and the electoral votes won by the presidential candidates reveal that in the comic 's future setting , today 's “ blue states ” ( that is , states that usually vote for Democratic candidates ) have lost political power to today 's Republican “ red states . ”
The Prez series is a sci-fi satire set in the year 2036 . The creative team – writer Mark Russell and artists Ben Caldwell , Mark Morales , and Jeremy Lawson – depicts an America where corporations and social media are out of control , politicians debase themselves on moronic media outlets , and an unassuming teenager named Beth Ross becomes an accidental Internet celebrity ( “ Corndog Girl ” ) and candidate for U.S. president . Because the series is a satire , the comic does not need to pay close attention to political details , but its creators deserve credit for following the constraints of the U. S. Constitution and the attention they give to their election map .
Although the Prez creative team makes some humorous changes to the U. S. political system ( for example , everyone – including kids – can run for office and vote for candidates on Twitter ) , the process for electing the president remains the same : to be elected , a presidential candidate must receive a majority of votes in the Electoral College . In the United States , presidents are not elected directly by the popular vote , but by electors . Every state has a specific number of electors equal to the state 's representation in Congress , and the Constitution gives the District of Columbia three electoral votes . So the total number of electoral votes is 538 ( 100 Senators + 435 House members + 3 D.C. electors = 538 ) .
To win the presidency , a candidate has to win a majority of electoral votes ; a minimum of 270 electoral votes is needed to win . In Prez , there are three presidential candidates : Tom Downey , Gary Farmer , and Beth Ross . Although the comic does not mention political parties , it is clear that Gary Farmer is a conservative candidate and presumably Republican , Sen. Tom Downey is likely a Democrat , and Beth Ross is politically uninterested , but has the unsolicited backing of a hacker collective .
The election map in Prez # 1 shows that the Democratic Party in 2036 remains strong in today 's blue states , and has even picked up a few traditionally conservative states like North Dakota and Montana . The Republicans are doing well in today 's red states in the Deep South and Midwest , and Beth “ Corndog Girl ” Ross has won Ohio . While the number and geographic distribution of red and blue states in Prez is similar to today 's politics ( see the 2012 presidential election map below ) , the allocation of electors – and political power – seems to have shifted in favor of red states .
On election night , Downey wins 261 electoral votes , and it appears that Farmer has won 259 electoral votes ; “ Corndog Girl ” Ross has won an unspecified number of electoral votes in Ohio ( mathematically , they should have won 18 electoral votes : 261 + 259 + 18 = 538 ) . None of the candidates have an electoral majority .
But if these candidates were running in next year 's 2016 presidential race , Democrat Tom Downey – based on the current electoral votes in the states the 2036 map shows them winning – would be the clear winner . Even if you exclude Alaska and Hawaii ( the 2036 election map does n't show how those states voted ) , Downey would have a majority – 300 electoral votes .
If you assume that in 2036 the Democrats have won Hawaii ( a traditional blue state which currently has 4 electoral votes ) and that Republicans have won Alaska ( a traditional red state which currently has 3 electoral votes ) , then – using 2016 electoral numbers – Downey would have won 304 electoral votes and Farmer would have won 216 electoral votes .
Comparing the Prez election results to modern electoral allocations , the fact that Downey does worse in 2036 ( he has 43 fewer electoral votes than they would have in 2016 ) and Farmer does better ( he has 43 more electoral votes than they would have in 2016 ) indicates that in the future world of Prez – since the allocation of state electors is based on population – red states are more populated and therefore have more Congressional representation and electors than they do today . Republican presidential candidates can win office with a fewer number of states than Democrats , and there are presumably a higher number of conservative Congressmen in the House of Representatives .
It is possible that the Prez creative team was not considering the electoral allocations and their implications when designing the election map . However , the candidates ' electoral allocations suggest that the electoral votes were carefully considered . The loss of 43 electoral votes from today 's allocations by one candidate ( Downey ) is equal to the electoral gains of another candidate ( Farmer ) . Also , Ohio 's 18 electoral votes in 2036 for Beth Ross is equal to the current electoral votes in that state . The precision of the electoral math suggests that the creative team took current and future electoral allocations into consideration when designing the election map .
The first issue of Prez presents several satiric conservative characters ( a homophobic cabal of conservative Senators trying to hold on to power , a dim presidential candidate , etc . ) and ideas ( replacing food stamps with corporate welfare ) , but does not provide details about how powerful these conservative forces are in the comic ; however , with some analysis and comparison to current political maps , its election map suggests that in the future American political system depicted in Prez , the population and political power have shifted from Democratic blue states to Republican red states .

The man accused of running across the field at Great American Ball Park during Wednesday night 's Reds game was arrested Thursday night .
Justin Buchanan , 19 , of Noblesville , Ind. , was arrested at the Cincinnati Police Department 's Central Business Headquarters at 8 p.m. Thursday . They were charged with criminal trespassing on a place of public amusement , a first degree misdemeanor .
Buchanan told The Enquirer Friday morning that they turned themselves in to police on Thursday night .
`` I 'm waiting for this to be finished up before I speak any more about it , '' Buchanan said Friday morning .
If Buchanan is found guilty of the charge , they could face up to 180 days in jail or a fine no more than $ 1,000 , according to Ohio law .
Buchanan 's arrest slip reads what most fans already knew . Police said that Buchanan entered the playing field during the eighth inning of the Reds ' game against the Chicago Cubs and delayed play as they ran across the field .

Police wrote on Buchanan 's arrest slip that they were identified through the help of statements they wrote on Twitter . Court documents also noted that Buchanan 's television interviews and additional social media posts assisted in their identification .
Future court dates for Buchanan were not immediately posted .
In a further attempt to capture their 30 seconds of fame , Buchanan was busy on social media Thursday morning , retweeting a GoFundMe link apparently set up by their friends to raise money to cover their legal fees .
`` Justin lost a 'what are the odds ' bet to hop the fence at the game and run across the field , '' the fundraising page says . `` Justin was n't going to chicken out to their friends so , when the 8th inning came around , they went for it .
`` Money raised with ( sic ) help with lawyer fees , court and possible bail . Any money raised over the amount needed to cover the legal fees WILL be donated to charity . ''
As of 8:30 a.m. Friday , one supporter had donated $ 25 to the account .

Yes , Walt Wawra is a real person . No , the letter we published from them Tuesday , about the “ confrontation ” they and their wife had with two Calgarians in Nose Hill Park , was not a hoax . The fact that so many readers have written in , or posted comments online , wondering if it was for real , speaks volumes about the cultural differences between Canadians and Americans . It gives the lie to those who say that Canadians are no different than Americans .
Wawra , who lives in Kalamazoo , Mich. , is a police officer . While on a recent visit to Calgary , they and their wife , Debbie , were approached by two young men on a pathway in Nose Hill Park , who asked the Wawras if they had been to the Stampede yet . When they asked the question a second time , Wawra moved between the men and their wife and told them they had no need to talk to them . They said they looked “ bewildered. ” The parties then went their separate ways .
In their letter , Wawra said it felt strange not to carry their off-duty handgun in Canada and added that they thanked the Lord they did n't pull a weapon on him . No benefit of the doubt given the young men , no thought that they might have just been trying to be friendly .
They also complained about Canadian gun laws , saying that in Canada , only the police and criminals carry handguns . Yes , that 's true , and it 's probably one of the reasons when there 's a dispute over a parking space in Canada , nobody dies from bullet wounds as a result .
Wawra 's mindset is what America 's gun mania has produced . How paranoid and how very sad .
Michigan Live story : Kalamazoo police officer bashed by Canadians on Twitter
Wawra wrote that they speculated the men did not have good intentions . They claim the men spoke in an “ aggressive , disrespectful and menacing manner. ” Menacing ? A question about the Stampede is construed as a menace ? Or , as someone commented on the Herald 's website : “ ... for asking if you had been to the Stampede ? Since when is that grounds to be dead ? ” Another commenter wrote : “ I can see why they were frightened . If you rearrange the letters in ‘ been to Stampede yet ? ' you get “ a beset potted enemy ' . ”
Most likely , the men noticed something about the Wawras that indicated they were tourists , and were trying to make conversation . Maybe they themselves were enjoying the Stampede 's centennial celebration and wanted to let these tourists know that their visit to Calgary would n't be complete without a day at the Stampede . The fact that the young men looked bewildered by Wawra 's response indicates that their intentions were indeed friendly ones and that they were quite puzzled at being rebuffed .
Gawker : Americans become laughingstock of Canada over letter
Wawra did not return my call requesting an interview Tuesday afternoon . Too bad . I would have liked to ask them why an American visitor to Calgary would treat a friendly encounter in a city park here as if it were a midnight stroll through a drug-dealer infested alley on the south side of Chicago . One can only stand open-mouthed at the knee-jerk mindset of suspicion , fear and loathing on the mean streets — which is so ingrained in Americans that they ca n't leave it at home when they visit another country .
Even Borat would have laughed at the security precautions the president of Kazakhstan took during a dinner in Manhattan — as the Central Asian strongman demanded waiters at a posh Soho restaurant be replaced with their own lackeys , their dishes be disinfected with vodka , and a doctor test every morsel of food for danger , sources said .
Nursultan Nazarbayev was so worried about their safety during their visit to the celebrity hangout Mamo on Monday that they garrisoned the eatery with security guards . “ He had eight people from the [ US ] Secret Service inside the restaurant , ” a witness told The Post . “ As well as 15 to 20 people from their own security detail . Outside the restaurant , it was insane . ”
Nazarbayev , 75 , even had their food tested by an underling , as if they were some kind of ancient king instead of a modern national leader .
“ He had their personal doctor go into the kitchen , as well , to test all the food , ” said a spy .
The doctor inspected the Mamo fare by placing it “ into little tubes , ” the source said . They then relayed the results to the president 's staff in the dining room through “ an earpiece , ” sources said .
All the grub passed inspection and the presidential party — which included themselves and some close family — looked “ really impressed ' with the meal , which included truffled pizza , penne with lobster , a burger and roast chicken . It was all delivered to the president by Nazarbayev 's own “ personal servants ” instead of restaurant waiters , a source said .
And in another twist , all the plates to hit the president 's table had to be “ disinfected with vodka — all of them. ” It was not clear why .
All of the security unnerved other diners in the restaurant , whose clientele includes Samuel L. Jackson , Jay-Z and Beyoncé .
“ I hope we are secure , ” one diner was overheard wondering . Another shot back , “ I think this is the most secure dinner you 've had in your entire life . ”
It 's not clear why Nazarbayev was so paranoid , though they have run Kazakhstan unopposed since 1991 and has been accused of silencing critical media and stamping down opposition . Kazakhstan has been satirized by comic Sacha Baron Cohen in the 2006 film “ Borat . ”
The Consulate General of the Republic Of Kazakhstan did not return a request for comment on Tuesday .
NYPD officials had sex with a prostitute dressed as a flight attendant during at least one trip on a private plane paid for by a business person at the heart of a federal probe into police corruption , The Post has learned .
Police brass joined the “ Mile High Club ” with the woman after departing from New Jersey 's Teterboro Airport en route to Las Vegas in 2014 , sources said .
The call girl repeated their “ Coffee , tea or me ? ” routine when the cops flew back from Vegas , sources said .
“ It was first-class plus , with full service , ” said a source close to the case .
“ They were n't on commercial airlines . The entertainment was quite good on board . ”
Jona Rechnitz , who is under investigation in a suspected gifts-for-favors scheme , provided the high-priced transportation , the sources said .
It was unclear who paid for the prostitute 's services and how many trips took place .
But both Rechnitz and Jeremy Reichberg , another subject of the joint FBI-NYPD probe , accompanied the cops during one getaway to Sin City , a source said .
Deputy Inspector James Grant and Detective Michael Milici were both identified by the sources as having been on board during at least one wild cross-country trip .
Grant , formerly commanding officer of the Upper East Side 's 19th Precinct , was stripped of their badge and transferred earlier this month , hours after The Post revealed that they were suspected of accepting cash and diamonds from Reichberg .
They were sent to the NYPD 's Medical Division in Queens .
Milici , a longtime community affairs officer in Borough Park , Brooklyn , was also placed on modified duty after invoking the Fifth Amendment in front of a federal grand jury , sources have said .
They have been assigned to the Courthouse Division .
Lawyers for Grant and Milici each said they “ deny the allegations ” about their married clients . Rechnitz declined to comment .
Reichberg 's lawyer said , “ Jeremy Reichberg is a good man who has helped many in their community . They have not committed any crime and does not deserve the constant false attacks to which they have been subjected in the press . ”
Last week , Police Commissioner Bill Bratton told The Post that the unfolding corruption scandal was the worst they had seen since the rampant , top-to-bottom bribery exposed by the Knapp Commission in the early 1970s .
In addition to the allegations involving top NYPD officials , sources have said that the feds are investigating Mayor Bill de Blasio 's campaign finances and the actions of their former fundraiser Ross Offinger .
Rechnitz was a top “ bundler ” of campaign contributions to de Blasio , and Reichberg hosted a fundraiser for Hizzoner 's Campaign for One New York .

Prepare to be amazed by this 340-year-old smart lock March 8th , 2017
Do you think technology from circa 1680 can still surprise and delight in the age of the iPhone and Alexa ? I did n't , but boy was I wrong .
Although we typically think that technology is driven by silicon chips and software , the definition is actually much broader :
technology |tekˈnäləjē| the application of scientific knowledge for practical purposes
I often forget this when looking at the human timeline from my 21st century vantage point . Then last weekend I discovered the `` detector Lock '' in the Rijksmuseum , created by British locksmith John Wilkes . The lock ( and those like it ) is a triumph of 17th century technology and a precursor to the so-called “ smart locks ” we see flooding the market today .
Tilt the man 's hat to lock it
This expertly crafted brass and steel lock would have been used on a door behind which valuables were kept . It 's called a `` detector '' because it features a dial that counts the number of times it 's been opened without the owner 's consent . On the surface you see a man holding a pointer . A tiny button on the man 's jacket resets the counter back to zero . The lock can be quickly ( but less securely ) activated by tilting the man 's hat , and then unlocked by turning what looks to be an ordinary pull knob while simultaneously holding the hat . A key is required to fully activate both of the locking bolts , but the keyhole is hidden behind the man 's swiveling front leg . It looks like something Spielberg dreamed up for an Indiana Jones film .
Here have a look , and remember , it 's over 300 years old :
Impressive , right ? Even more so when you consider this lock 's rudimentary form of two-factor security is still employed today : something you have ( a physical key ) and something secret ( its obscure operation ) .
Like I said , impressive .
Sam Heughan is offensively handsome . In character as Scottish highlander Jamie Fraser in television series Outlander , they look like an advert for Scotland 's tourist board , all burly and most often seen in a kilt riding a horse . Be warned ; there is a lot of knee porn in this show .
Amazon Prime Instant Video
Their star is set to rise considerably as tonight Outlander makes its UK debut on Amazon Prime .

Based on the books by US author Diana Gabaldon , the show is already wildly popular in America . Its first episode in August 2014 attracted five million viewers and has caused an increase in visitors to Scotland , according to the BFI . It focuses on female protagonist Claire ( Caitriona Balfe ) , who , after just getting married , is transported from post World War II to 18th Century Scotland . She 's then rescued by a Highland rebel amid a war with the English .
Rex
Adapted by Ronald Moore , who wrote and produced Battlestar Galactica , the series has received a lot of positive attention for its sex scenes , in which cameras roll over the best parts of both leads ' physiques - both man and woman . Ladies , you are encouraged to stare , sit back and enjoy in the way in which our male counterparts so often do .
And it 's not only the show that encourages gender equality . So does its indisputably hunky hero Heughan ( mind explodes ) .

`` Outlander is progressive in the way it looks at women , '' Heughan told GLAMOUR . `` It 's wonderful that it 's being seen that way , but it 's such a shame that this is new . Part of the reason it 's been popular is maybe because we have a female protagonist who is very strong ; that 's unusual but it should n't be . I hope people look at it and enjoy it . ''
Amazon Prime Instant Video
While the sex scenes are explicit , they are not gratuitous and , Heughan says , to 're just a way of showing the growth of the relationship between the leads . Also unusually for a female character , Claire is the more sexually experienced of the two - in fact , Jamie is a virgin . Not that he 's not had much action before ( at one point , they tell Claire when they ask them how they learnt to kiss so artfully , `` I said I was a virgin , not a monk '' ) , he 's just never gone the whole way .
`` There are other programmes where there are sex scenes , but there is equal exposure between the sexes here , '' they sad . `` It 's not exposure for exposure 's sake . None of us would have been happy with that . We had a lot of serious discussions with producers and writers about how those scenes should be filmed . Ultimately , if something has to be sexual should be it of the mind . ''

The dynamic between the two is as compelling as looking at Jamie 's pecs by firelight ( sorry for the shameless ogling but this is strongly encouraged ) ; they are both from different eras , so as you can imagine , there are differences of opinion .
`` She is slightly more experienced and they are grown up for their age and has their own set of moral values , '' said Heughan . `` She is more modern way of thinking because she 's from a different time . There is one scene where they do something wrong and they punish them for it - they spank them In that period of time , that was the right thing to do . You obviously would n't do that now , but then it was acceptable . It 's a battle of two time periods , but they always come to a conclusion over it . ''
Heughan 's upbringing sounds like something from Outlander - they were raised in Dumfries and Galloway in Scotland in converted stables in a castle grounds . There were four people in their class until they were 14 , so friends were few and far between . They did a lot of travelling and eventually decided on acting and landed a place at the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland .
They like playing period roles , and has previously served as a young Alexander the Great in the 2010 film of the same name and also a bereft husband in 2014 's Emulsion , which is part set in the 60s .
`` I like to have something to base a role on , '' said Heughan . `` We can use Diana 's books and historical sources . The idea of playing a Scotsman and having a sword and a horse also really appealed . Jamie has a long interesting journey - could I do it ? ''
Perhaps due to its fantasy thread and heated sex scenes , Outlander has been likened to Game of Thrones - a comparison Heughan shrugs off .
`` It 's fair enough , '' they said . `` Outlander is based on a group of books ; there 's a slight fantasy element to it , but ours is authentic - we try to stick to historical accuracy as possible . Ours is about a small group of people and a core relationship , rather than big armies . ''

The actor has already attracted a strong fan base , named the Heughlians , who between them have raised a impressive $ 29,342 for Leukaemia & Lymphoma Research - Heughan 's charity of choice .
Despite this , they seem blissfully unaware of the fame that is sure to beset them soon . `` No , I do n't feel prepared for all that , '' they said . `` I 'm just excited to see how it goes down . ''

There is an old story about a salesperson who was sent to South America to sell Swedish arms . Once they sent a telegram to their employer : “ The war is ending . Send more weapons ” . This obviously happened many years ago but comes to mind again when reflecting on Sweden 's recent diplomatic dispute with Saudi Arabia .
Sweden likes to present itself as a “ humanitarian great power ” . True , when it comes to international development aid , Sweden probably gives more aid as a percentage of GDP ( although part of it might be tied to Swedish exports ) . It receives also more refugees per capita than most other countries .
But when it comes to arm export , Sweden seems not better or worse than other countries . Production and export of arms is one of the few remaining areas that have not been regulated by EU . Member states are free to export what they want to whom they want , provided that no weapon embargo has been imposed . Free also to bribe their way to arms deals with dictatorships .
Sweden used to have a strong military based on general conscription and its air force was one of the biggest in Europe . The idea was to defend Swedish territory against an invasion of the kind which happened to its neighbors during the Second World War . There was no need for Nazi-Germany to invade Sweden because it continued until late 1944 to export vital products for the Nazi war machine , in particular iron ore .
To supply its own military with weapons , Sweden has built up an advanced local arms industry . To make the industry profitable , arms export was allowed under certain conditions and control . The export was not seen as a trade objective in itself but as a means to sustain the industry and enable it to produce weapons for local use . But this is hardly needed any longer since the army has been drastically reduced . The weapons can be imported to less cost .
However , the same old argument is still used . In reality , arms export nowadays serves rather as a starter or grease for development of trade relations with foreign markets . As in the case of Saudi Arabia , the country which currently is carrying out unprovoked air strikes against Yemen , resulting in the loss of many civilian lives .
International New York Times reported on 31 March that according to the International Organization for Migration at least 40 people had been killed and more than 200 people wounded in an air strike against a camp for internally displaced persons .
If someone is looking for a condemnation on the website of the Swedish Ministry of Foreign Affairs against the Saudi air strikes , they or they will not find it . No wonder . Sweden has gone out of its way to repair its damaged relations with Saudi Arabia , after deciding some weeks ago not to renew a bilateral agreement on military cooperation with Saudi Arabia .
What happened in this sad story was revealed recently in an investigative piece in the Swedish daily Dagens Nyheter ( http : //www.dn.se/ekonomi/darfor-blev-saudikrisen-sa-allvarlig/ ) . Sweden had already in 2005 , during the previous social-democratic government signed a military cooperation agreement with Saudi Arabia .
The agreement had to be renewed each fifth year . In 2010 it was renewed by the former center-right government . Then a scandal happened when it was disclosed in 2012 that a fictitious company had been established , without the formal involvement of the government , to handle the contacts with the Saudis . The Swedish defense minister at the time had to resign . Plans for helping the Saudis building a production facility were apparently cancelled .
For the Saudis the agreement was a condition for buying advanced weapons manufactured in Sweden , such as Erieye ( an airborne early warning and control system ) and Bill 2 ( a guided anti-tank missile ) . And indeed , Saudi Arabia bought weapons for billions of Swedish crowns . A new sale of anti-tank missiles is reported to be in the pipe-line .
But the Environment Party , the minor partner in the new Swedish center-left government which came to power after the elections in September 2014 , opposed renewing the agreement . The Swedish foreign minister Margit Wallström criticized openly Saudi Arabia for its human rights record . The impression was that the agreement was to be cancelled because of this .
And without much ado , the Swedish ambassador in Riyaidh was instructed on 8 March to inform the Saudis that the agreement had been cancelled . It did n't help that 31 CEOs of leading Swedish companies wrote an op-ed in Dagens Nyheter , warning the government that Sweden 's reputation as trade partner was at stake . Sweden 's export to Saudi Arabia worth 11 billion Swedish crowns in 2014 was threatened .
The Saudis did n't take long time to react . Wallström had been invited to give a key-note speech at the meeting of the Arab League in Cairo on 9 March . Them speech was cancelled and they were forced to leave Cairo without accomplishing their task . All the Arab ministers of foreign affairs condemned Sweden for its criticism of Saudi Arabia . The Saudi Arabian ambassador was recalled from Stockholm .
Since then the relations between Sweden and Saudi Arabia have barely been repaired . In an unusual and possibly unconstitutional step the Swedish king was asked by the government – which in principle is against the monarchy – to intervene and send a letter of apology to their Saudi Arabian counterpart , asking for respectful and good relations .
Internationally , Sweden seems to have been credited for risking its profitable arms export for standing up against Saudi Arabia 's human rights abuses . The truth is that all what Sweden wanted was to stop supporting Saudi Arabia in building its own capacity for manufacturing weapons . To continue selling anti-tank missiles and other weapons to Saudi Arabia – that 's obviously OK .

It started last season , prior to a nationally-televised game . LeBron James has grown accustomed to riding their bike around Miami so much that they now use it to stay in game shape . Per the Sun-Sentinel : “ LeBron James at some point lost count . Actually , they never started keeping track . At some point this season , they occasionally began riding their bicycle to practice instead of driving . Then it turned into riding to morning shootarounds . And then games . Suddenly , James was spending more time on the bike than driving around in expensive cars . The added conditioning is why they seem to have no problem logging 42 minutes in the most routine of games . That was James ' stat line in the Heat 's 103-92 comeback victory against the Minnesota Timberwolves Tuesday at AmericanAirlines Arena . [ … ] ‘ I felt great , ' James said . ‘ I did n't get tired . I do n't think I got tired ( Tuesday ) night . I felt great . I could have played again if we had to . Yeah , I 've been biking a little more than usual . It 's fun . It 's also conditioning , it 's cardio . ' [ … ] James has made the bike ride from their Coconut Grove home three times this season . Each trek takes from about 30 to 45 minutes , depending on if James is ‘ pushing it . ' Last Saturday they made the trip four times in one day , riding to shootaround and back in the morning . A few hours later , they rode back and forth for the game against Washington Wizards . The last trip occurred about an hour after the Heat 's 30-point victory . ‘ I got lights on my bike , ' James said . ‘ I 'm serious . This is n't a joke . Of course , safety first . ' James risks the chance of being noticed during one of their many rides . Their solution is simple : ‘ People try to stop me but I 'm in a zone . ' ”
A German Shepherd named Rex was so aggressive that their handlers debated putting them down before they came to Puriton Horse and Animal Rescue in Somerset , England eight years ago .
Over time and with training , Rex calmed down a bit , the Western Daily Press reported -- but they are n't completely rehabilitated until three months ago , when they met a goose named Geraldine .
With Geraldine by their side , 11-year-old Rex went from dangerous to mellow , according to the Daily Press . Workers originally worried that they might hurt Geraldine , but instead they showered them with kisses .
“ It 's so comical to see them , '' Sheila Brislin , of the Rescue , told the paper , `` because they love each other to bits . ''
Puriton Horse and Animal Rescue takes in horses , dogs and other farm animals that need to find new homes , according to its website .
Before they took Rex in , they were found chained up in a scrapyard , SWNS reported . He 'd also bitten handlers at a previous shelter . But the Rescue and Geraldine have changed their demeanor .

ST. TAMMANY PARISH ( WGNO ) - Ian Somerhalder was raised in Covington and is adored by teenaged girls everywhere . But Wednesday night , the CW network 's Vampire Diaries star appeared in a different role , as a critic of a proposed oil fracking project in St. Tammany Parish .
`` The fracking process does not lend itself to being in an environment that is considered a wetland , '' Somerhalder told WGNO News . `` The aquifer that feeds this area is the same aquifer that is threatened by hydraulic fracking . ''
Helis oil is looking to drill a well just outside of Mandeville and north of Interstate 12 . Wednesday night the company presented its plan for the well to a state regulatory department .
`` The project has been very commonly done in Tangipahoa and many other parishes and counties across the country for decades and can be done safely , and will be done here safely , '' Helis spokesperson Charlotte Batson told WGNO News .
The meeting was a first of its kind for the state which allowed the permit hearing to be held on the road and open to the public . Normally the hearings are held in Baton Rouge . Wednesday 's was at Lakeshore High School .
A group called Concerned Citizens of St. Tammany is leading the effort to fight the fracking project . Opponents blame fracking for everything from pollution to earthquakes in other states . The concerned citizens group also says the proposal violates St. Tammany zoning laws .
`` And if zoning laws do n't matter , why do we have them to begin with ? Do whatever you want to do because that 's the mentality we have up in Baton Rouge , and we 're going to change it , '' said the president of Concerned Citizens of St. Tammany , Rick Franzo .
Wednesday 's crowd at the hearing appeared to be mostly against the project . But some people showed up to support the drilling and the jobs it would create .
`` There 's no reason not to trust fracking . It works , '' one man told WGNO News .
The meeting is just the latest for St. Tammany . Prior meetings also attracted big crowds . But this one included many younger faces , teenagers who showed up to see Somerhalder .
People on both sides of the issue viewed the younger audience members as an opportunity to give new people a voice in the fracking decision .
`` And I like the fact that these young kids are here . You know why ? Because St Tammany Parish will belong to them in the future , '' Franzo said .
`` Hopefully they 'll come away having learned something about the oil and gas industry and the very high standards to which Helis Oil holds themselves in conducting their operations , '' Baton said .
`` These young , incredible individuals are our future , '' said Somerhalder .
A new online Isaac Newton archive sheds light on an era where science , theology , alchemy and plain old black magic was all intertwined , Liz Williams reports for the Guardian .
Back in the day , our ancestors were not nearly as concerned with the question of where science separates from spiritual practice as we are . They just went with it -- sometimes with what we today would consider a reckless disregard of actual science .
Israel 's national library recently uploaded the archive of 7,500 handwritten religious writings from Newton and placed it online . `` Today , we tend to make a distinction between science and faith , but to Newton it was all a part of the same world , '' Milka Levy-Rubin , a curator , told an AP reporter . `` He believed that careful study of holy texts was a type of science , that if analyzed correctly could predict what was to come . ''
Liz Williams reports :
Newton was characteristically thorough : they learned Hebrew , and studied Kabbalism and the Talmud in order to divine future events.These recently published writings include work on the geometry of Solomon 's Temple , and interpretation of the Bible . They predicted the end of the world ( 2060 , just for change ) . These days , we may scoff : it 's all too easy to envisage Newton as some socially challenged hacker looking up conspiracy theories on the internet . John Maynard Keyne 's comment that Newton was `` the last of the magicians '' rather than the `` first of the Age of Reason '' may be inaccurate from both sides of the mirror ( he certainly was n't the last of the magicians in their country ) , but Keynes had a point .
Newton was not alone in their belief that scripture could provide a code to the natural world as their view was commonly held by other commentators , both philosophers of science and historians of esoteric . They all had similar interest in theology , alchemy , divination , physics , optics , healing and black magic . Although , alchemy was a risky undertaking as it was banned at the time .
As it turned out , Newton did not succeed in producing philosopher 's stone or the elixir of life , but they did manage to generate a dendritic Diana 's Tree ( or Philosopher 's Tree ) from mercury in a solution of silver nitrate , which they were convinced had an innate life within metals .
In many ways Newton created an example of how to take a cautious modern approach to science , Williams notes . They were notoriously reluctant to publish anything they were unsure of , which is an area where alchemy and religious writing falls . One might argue that from this approach they bridge the gap between magic and science more effectively than what might otherwise appear .
Most of their alchemic work ended up in the possession of Maynard Keynes except for the religious writings that were passed on to a Jewish document collector , Abraham Yahuda , who also turned up at the same auction in 1936 . After Yahuda 's death , the collection went to the Jerusalem National and University Library . The archive can be accessed through the University of Sussex 's Newton Project .

Obama had Romney on the ropes on topics ranging from jobs , the Keystone Pipeline , and China at last night 's second debate . But , the real zinger , Romney delivered to himself .
When asked how they would promote pay equity for women , as Obama did with the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009 , Romney dodged the question . Instead , they spun a tale about how , as governor of Massachusetts , they made a special effort to appoint more women to senior-level positions .
The only problem is , the story Romney told was false . They did n't seek out qualified women as they claimed , and the number of women working under Romney in senior-level positions actually decreased by almost 10 % during their term .
“ And – and so we – we took a concerted effort to go out and find women who had backgrounds that could be qualified to become members of our cabinet . I went to a number of women 's groups and said : ‘ 'Can you help us find folks , ' and they brought us whole binders full of women . ”
You can watch Romney saying this in the video below :
Before the end of the debate , the ‘ binders full of women ' comment had gone viral , spawning a Twitter storm , graphics on Tumblr , and a Facebook page with almost 260,000 fans at time of press . The phrase was also the third-fastest rising search on Google during the debate .
Here 's what actually happened : A group of Massachusetts women 's advocates called MassGAP collaborated on identifying women qualified to assume senior government positions before Romney even took office , according to David Bernstein and others familiar with the binders Romney is describing . The women 's group took the initiative to deliver the data to Romney ; they did not request it as they indicated in the debate . Bernstein writes :
“ [ MassGAP ] did the research and put together the binder full of women qualified for all the different cabinet positions , agency heads , and authorities and commissions . They presented this binder to Governor Romney when they were elected . I have written about this before , in various contexts ; tonight I 've checked with several people directly involved in the MassGAP effort who confirm that this history as I 've just presented it is correct – and that Romney 's claim tonight , that they asked for such a study , is false . ”
Let 's look at how Romney 's record with women really stacks up :
Representation of women in senior state government positions fell from 30 % before Romney took office to 27.6 % at the end of their term . Their successor immediately reversed that trend .
from 30 % before Romney took office to 27.6 % at the end of their term . Their successor immediately reversed that trend . Bain Capital , the company Romney headed for more than 15 years , counts only 8 % women among its 87 managing directors and senior executives — meaning the company appoints males to senior positions 92 % of the time .
and senior executives — meaning the company appoints males to senior positions 92 % of the time . In 2005 , Governor Romney vetoed a Massachusetts bill requiring hospitals to provide emergency contraception to rape victims .
. In 2004 , Romney terminated Ardith Wieworka , a lesbian woman , from the Massachusetts Office of Child Care Services . Wieworka believes they were fired because they made public their intention to marry their partner as the Governor furiously tried to roll back the legalization of gay marriage in the state .
as the Governor furiously tried to roll back the legalization of gay marriage in the state . Earlier this year , when Romney 's campaign was asked if they supported legislation to ensure equal pay for women , their staff fell silent and told the reporter , “ We 'll get back to you on that. ” What else could you expect from a man who does n't consider women theirs equals ?
So , you tell me , is Romney really interested in helping women ?

Yeah , yeah , I know : Their lips are moving . But in preparation for the first 2012 presidential debate Wednesday night , Hugh Hewitt has catalogued a few of Obama 's “ poker tells. ” The Greatest Orator in Human History always has certain little giveaways that tell you a particularly egregious lie is comin ' right up :
Talk show hosts love when the president gives one of their very rare press conferences or any other occasion when they are off prompter . That is when these “ tells ” surface , giving all veteran Obama observers the verbal heads-up that the president has entered the land of thinly disguised fantasy or obvious dissembling .
First , the president begins a pattern of “ ahs ” and “ uhmms ” which are as embarrassing as they are revealing . The awkward pausing punctuated by these semi-stutters increases in frequency as the president senses their own flailing about .
Next , the president begins filibustering . Their average length of answer in every press conference is already epic , but they have been getting worse as the presidency has dragged on…
Watch as well for nonresponsive self-pity , verbal essays on how difficult it was when they took over and how hard they have been working . Self-pity and self-regard are not designed to endear them to the unemployed or even the economically fragile , so they will be coached to try to avoid displaying their sense of outrage at being thought a failure or “ in over their head , ” but the president 's sense of their own immensity is so great as to blow past such base political calculations…
BELLEVUE , WA â€ “ Citing concerns about First Amendment erosion based on revelations about covert Justice Department probes of journalists , the Citizens Committee for the Right to Keep and Bear Arms today called the government snooping â€œdeplorable , if not despicable.â€
â€œIt is disturbing that James Rosen , who covers the State Department for Fox News was targeted , â€ said CCRKBA Chairman Alan Gottlieb , â€œbut now published reports suggest that the DOJ , in a separate effort , apparently also targeted Fox News reporter William La Jeunesse , who broke several stories about Operation Fast and Furious .
â€œWe find this deplorable and despicable , â€ they added , â€œand a clear sign that the Obama administration is not simply out of touch , it is out of control . It is time for Congress to put a check on the Executive branch and rein these people in , and it is also time for Attorney General Eric Holder to go.â€
Gottlieb noted that , â€œIt is the role of the press to be a watchdog on government , not the other way around.â€ They said Rosen and La Jeunesse â€œnot only did nothing wrong , they did their jobs . In La Jeunesseâ€™s case , they have been instrumental in exposing the outrage known as Fast and Furious to the American people.â€
Fast and Furious is the scandalous Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , Firearms and Explosives gun trafficking operation that authorized at least 2,000 AK-type rifles to be purchased by known criminal suspects . It was terminated immediately after a gun associated with the operation was recovered at the scene of a gunfight in 2010 that resulted in the death of Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry .
â€œIt should not surprise anyone that the First Amendment is every bit as important to us as the Second Amendment , â€ Gottlieb observed . â€œThe Citizens Committee is not an organization that cherry picks from the Bill of Rights . Unlike the Obama administration , we revere all the individual rights protected by the Constitution , while they seem intent on ignoring its very existence .
â€œIn light of these scandals , â€ they concluded , â€œit is clear why gun owners are being joined by growing legions of other citizens in their distrust of government.â€
Saudi Arabian forces , joined by nine other countries , have launched a military operation in Yemen against Shiite Houthi rebels , the Saudi ambassador to the US said . The offensive , which started with airstrikes , will also involve “ other military assets . ”
According to Ambassador Adel bin Ahmed Al-Jubeir , the military operation in Yemen started at 7 p.m. EST ( 11 p.m. GMT ) .
Obama ordered support to Saudi-led op , UN still ‘ checking details '
US President Obama has authorized the provision of logistical and intelligence support to the Gulf Cooperation Council ( GCC ) -led military operations in Yemen , the White House said in a statement , confirming that Washington had close communication with Hadi , the Saudis and other GCC states prior to the launch of the military operation .
“ While US forces are not taking direct military action in Yemen in support of this effort , we are establishing a Joint Planning Cell with Saudi Arabia to coordinate US military and intelligence support , ” the statement said .
Moreover , the White House urged the Houthis to immediately halt “ destabilizing military actions ” and to return to political dialogue with the deposed Yemeni government .
Al Arabiya reported that warplanes of the Royal Saudi Air Force bombed positions of Yemen 's Houthi militia , targeting their air defenses .

The Saudi-led coalition has declared Yemeni airspace a “ restricted zone. ” Ships in the region have also been urged not to approach Yemen 's ports due to the ongoing military operation .
More than 20 people have reportedly died and over 30 others were injured following Saudi Arabia-led airstrikes in Yemen , Sputnik news agency cited local security and medical sources as saying .
The majority of the strikes around Sanaa hit residential areas located near the capital 's international airport . Government buildings and the airport were also hit during the offensive .
Reports from the ground indicate that Saudi forces have bombed an office belonging to Houthi rebels in Sanaa 's Jiraf area . A Houthi-run TV channel reported dozens of civilian casualties following airstrikes north of Sanaa .
Residents said that warplanes targeted the capital 's airport , according to Reuters .
Houthis used heavy anti-aircraft fire to respond to the bombing .
Another warplane attack was said to have been launched on Sanaa 's Dulaimi military airbase . Al-Jubair told Al Jazeera that Houthi fighters are in control of Yemeni 's ballistic and heavy weaponry and could be taking over the country 's air force .
Reports citing Yemeni security services said four Sukhoi jets stationed at the Dulaimi military airbase were destroyed in airstrikes . Meanwhile , an Al Arabiya report claimed that Saudi-led strikes destroyed the airbase along with several arsenals , as well as taking out most of the rebels ' air defenses .

Meanwhile , Saudi Arabia , the United Arab Emirates , Bahrain , Qatar , and Kuwait issued a joint statement saying that they “ decided to repel Houthi militias , Al-Qaeda and ISIS ( Islamic State ) in the country. ” The Gulf states said they were responding to a “ major threat ” to the stability of the region , saying that their cause is to “ repel Houthi aggression ” in Yemen .

`` ... Launched military operations in support of the people of Yemen and their legitimate government . '' — Saudi Embassy ( @ SaudiEmbassyUSA ) March 25 , 2015
Al-Jubeir said the 10-country coalition launched the campaign “ to protect and defend the legitimate government ” of Yemeni President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi after their appeal to intervene .
Hadi 's aide has revealed that the president is “ in high spirits ” and has remained at their Aden base in the south of Yemen . “ The president ... thanks Gulf countries , Egypt , Jordan , and Sudan , and all countries in the region , ” the director of Hadi 's office , Mohammed Marem , told Reuters . The offensive has “ restored people 's determination ” to fight against the Houthis , they said .
Saudi Arabia is planning to commit 100 warplanes and 150,000 soldiers to the Yemen offensive , according to Al Arabiya . The United Arab Emirates , Bahrain , Qatar , Kuwait , and Jordan are also willing to contribute aircraft , while Egypt , Pakistan , Jordan , and Sudan want to contribute to ground operations .
Egypt is providing political and military support for the operation , the country 's state media said . Cairo is prepared to take part in air , naval and ground operations if necessary , the Egyptian Foreign Ministry has announced .
Media reports said that Jordan , Sudan , Morocco and Pakistan are also part of the coalition and have offered their support for military operation in Yemen .
While the Saudi envoy insisted Washington only “ consulted ” Riyadh , a US official told Reuters on condition of anonymity that America has been supporting the military operation in an unspecified way .

Houthi leaders have in turn branded the Saudi offensive as “ aggression ” and warned that it will drag the entire Gulf region into conflict .

“ There is an aggression underway on Yemen and we will confront it valiantly , ” a member of the Houthi political office , Mohammed al-Bukhaiti , told Al Jazeera . “ Military operations will drag the region to a wide war . ”
Meanwhile , UN deputy spokesperson Farhan Haq told TASS that the UN is aware of Saudi Arabia launching a military operation in Yemen and is looking into more details . Just a few hours before the operation , Haq told journalists that the UN does not believe in military actions to resolve the conflict in Yemen .
Before the launch of the offensive in Yemen , Houthi militants claimed to have captured the southern seaport of Aden , President Hadi 's stronghold . The fighters said the city was under their control and the president 's supporters were being arrested .
The rebels have announced a 20 million riyal ( US $ 100,000 ) reward for Hadi 's capture , after alleging that they fled the country , Lebanon-based Al-Manar TV reported .
In August 2014 , Houthi rebels moved in from the north and demanded economic and political reforms . In September , they seized key state installations in Sanaa .
As Houthis took command of the capital last month , the US embassy closed its operations in Sanaa , while the two rival governments in the north and south have continued to compete for power . Last weekend , Shiite rebels seized Yemen 's third largest city Taiz .

Controversial remarks [ edit ]
Apology to Canadians [ edit ]
In a five-minute segment broadcast on Tuesday , March 17 , 2009 , Gutfeld and their panel discussed Canadian Lieutenant General Andrew Leslie 's statement that the Canadian Armed Forces may require a one-year `` synchronized break '' once Canada 's mission in Afghanistan ends in 2011 .

Our Fearless Leader has come up with a rather interesting colloquial phrase :
US President Barack Obama launched a mocking counter-attack Thursday at pundits who believe the euphoric early promise of their presidency is evaporating amid bitter political warfare .
Obama , who has watched their poll ratings dip sharply over recent months , drew comparisons to their 2008 presidential campaign , which was several times all but written off by media experts who set prevailing political wisdom .
“ We have been through this before , in Iowa , ” Obama said , referring to the first state to hold a 2008 Democratic nominating contest , which saw them capture a come-from-behind win .
“ All Washington said ‘ Oh , it 's over , ' hand-wringing angst … ”
Then Obama drew parallels to the media frenzy that greeted the nomination of firebrand Republican vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin in 2008 .
“ The media was obsessed with it , cable was 24 hours a day , ” Obama told a friendly audience of grass-roots Democratic activists at a Washington forum broadcast live over the web .
“ ‘ Obama 's lost their mojo , ' you remember all that ?
“ There is something about August going into September where everybody in Washington gets all wee weed up ! ”
As the battle over raising the debt ceiling looms large in Congress , President Obama explained to ABC 's George Stephanopoulos why they voted in 2006 against a debt-limit increase , risking what their White House calls today economic “ armageddon . ”
The short version , from Obama : I was young and naive.Obama , from ABC 's transcript :
I think that it 's important to understand the vantage point of a Senator versus the vantage point of a…President . When you 're a Senator , traditionally what 's happened is this is always a lousy vote . Nobody likes to be tagged as having increased the debt limit for the United States by a trillion dollars… As President , you start realizing , “ You know what ? We– we ca n't play around with this stuff . This is the full faith in credit of the United States. ” And so that was just a example of a new Senator , you know , making what is a political vote as opposed to doing what was important for the country . And I 'm the first one to acknowledge it .
Obama told Stephanopoulos that they expect many of the Republicans in the Senate to act the way they did five years ago . He 's planning on getting the ceiling raised with Democratic support , though Obama added “ we 're going to need some votes from the other side . ”
The full interview will air on Thursday 's edition of ABC World News Tonight .
Watch the debt ceiling clip released this afternoon :
Colorado State basketball will play at Missouri State on Nov. 28 as part of the annual Mountain West/Missouri Valley Challenge , the leagues announced Wednesday . The two teams met once previously , a 76-61 CSU victory in the 2014 Great Alaska Shootout .
`` We are excited that the Mountain West/Missouri Valley Challenge continues , '' CSU coach Larry Eustachy said in a statement . `` Playing on the road against a Missouri State team that is rich in tradition will be a great early-season challenge for our team next year . ''
The Rams are 3-3 all-time in the MW/MVC Challenge after last year 's home loss to Wichita State , which is now in the American Athletic Conference . Missouri State is coming off a 17-16 campaign in 2016-17 , including a 7-11 mark in conference play .
Other challenge matchups include Loyola ( Chicago ) -Boise State , Utah State-Valparaiso , UNLV-Northern Iowa , Air Force-Indiana State , Illinois State-Nevada , Evansville-New Mexico , San Jose State-Southern Illinois , Drake-Wyoming and Bradley-San Diego State .
When I was growing up , the Christmas season usually kicked off in early December with classic Christmas movies . One that I looked forward to every year was Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer . Burl Ives sang all the tunes from that movie . Here we go…
Rudolph , the red-nosed reindeer
had a very shiny nose .
And if you ever saw him ,
you would even say it glows .
All of the other reindeer
used to laugh and call them names .
They never let poor Rudolph
join in any reindeer games .
Then one foggy Christmas Eve
Santa came to say :
“ Rudolph with your nose so bright ,
wo n't you guide my sleigh tonight ? ”
Then all the reindeer loved them
as they shouted out with glee ,
Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer ,
you 'll go down in history !

From Redfin , “ Best deal around . Great plan 1 in private cul de sac location in the prestige Ledges at Turtle Ridge . Home shows as new very clean private location and great value for the Ledges estate . Nice rear yard area and great street appeal . Truly great deal here priced below most homes in area . ”
How can any “ plan 1 ” be worth over $ 1,000,000 ?

This one is n't a rollback yet , but I doubt the owners care because they have already made their money on the deal . Let 's look at the loan history on this property and see just how these people managed to live over the last 3 years .
The property was purchased in January 2005 for $ 1,157,000 . The combined first and second mortgages totalled $ 1,156,730 leaving a downpayment of $ 270 . Let 's just call it 100 % financing .
By April , they owners were able to find refinancing through Countrywide with a $ 999,999 first mortgage . This mortgage was an Option ARM with a 1 % teaser rate . The minimum payment would be $ 3,216 per month .
Also in April of 2005 , they took out a simultaneous second mortgage for $ 215,000 pulling out their first $ 58,000 .
So look at their situation : They are living in a million dollar plus home in Turtle Ridge making payments less than those renting , and they “ made ” $ 58,000 in their first 4 months of ownership .
Apparently , these owners liked how hard their house was working for them , so they opened a revolving line of credit ( HELOC ) in August 2005 for $ 293,000 . Did they spend it all ? I ca n't be sure , but the following certainly suggests they did .
In December of 2005 , they extended their HELOC to $ 397,990 .
In June of 2006 , they extended their HELOC to $ 485,000 .
In April of 2007 , the well ran dry as they did their final HELOC of $ 491,000 . I bet they were pissed when they could n't get more money .
So by April 2007 , they have a first mortgage ( Option ARM with a 1 % teaser rate ) for $ 999,999 , and a HELOC for $ 491,000 . These owners pulled $ 333,000 in HELOC money to fuel consumer spending .
Assuming they spent the entire HELOC ( does anyone think they did n't ? ) , and assuming the negative amortization on the first mortgage has increased the loan balance , the total debt on the property exceeds $ 1,500,000 . The asking price of $ 1,249,000 does not look like a rollback , but if the property actually sells at this price , the lender on the HELOC ( Washington Mutual ) will lose over $ 300,000 .
These owners will probably just walk away . I doubt they have any assets . They never put any money into the deal , they pulled out $ 333,000 in cash , and they got to live in Turtle Ridge for 3 years . Not a bad deal — for them .
Karma will not leave these people alone though . They have become accustomed to a lifestyle far beyond their means . Their house was providing them with $ 111,000 a year in tax-free income . When they get forced out , their credit will be ruined , and they will have to go from living the life of the nouveau riche to being a destitute renter . We can only hope this transition is painful and the memory of what they lost lingers for years .
These people likely drank the kool aid and actually believed this kind of lifestyle could be sustained . That level of ignorance makes it hard to have much sympathy for them . However , when you see the excess of this lifestyle , you ca n't help but wonder if it was worth it .
If you knew prices were going to collapse , and the lifestyle was not sustainable ( like many on this board did , ) would you have done it anyway ? When you see the lives led by people like today 's owners , it is not difficult to see why so many chose that life .
Sign of the times
We 've now entered a new stage of the financial crisis : the ritual assigning of blame . It began in earnest with Monday 's congressional roasting of Lehman Bros. CEO Richard Fuld and continued on Tuesday with Capitol Hill solons delving into the failure of AIG . On the Republican side of Congress , in the right-wing financial media ( which is to say the financial media ) , and in certain parts of the op-ed-o-sphere , there 's a consensus emerging that the whole mess should be laid at the feet of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , the failed mortgage giants , and the Community Reinvestment Act , a law passed during the Carter administration . The CRA , which was amended in the 1990s and this decade , requires banks—which had a long , distinguished history of not making loans to minorities—to make more efforts to do so .
The thesis is laid out almost daily on the Wall Street Journal editorial page , in the National Review , and on the campaign trail . John McCain said yesterday , “ Bad mortgages were being backed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , and it was only a matter of time before a contagion of unsustainable debt began to spread. ” Washington Post columnist Charles Krauthammer provides an excellent example , writing that “ much of this crisis was brought upon us by the good intentions of good people. ” They continue : “ For decades , starting with Jimmy Carter 's Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 , there has been bipartisan agreement to use government power to expand homeownership to people who had been shut out for economic reasons or , sometimes , because of racial and ethnic discrimination . What could be a more worthy cause ? But it led to tremendous pressure on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac—which in turn pressured banks and other lenders—to extend mortgages to people who were borrowing over their heads . That 's called subprime lending . It lies at the root of our current calamity. ” The subtext : If only Congress did n't force banks to lend money to poor minorities , the Dow would be well on its way to 36,000 . Or , as Fox Business Channel 's Neil Cavuto put it , “ I do n't remember a clarion call that said : Fannie and Freddie are a disaster . Loaning to minorities and risky folks is a disaster . ”
Let me get this straight . Investment banks and insurance companies run by centimillionaires blow up , and it 's the fault of Jimmy Carter , Bill Clinton , and poor minorities ?
These arguments are generally made by people who read the editorial page of the Wall Street Journal and ignore the rest of the paper—economic know-nothings whose opinions are informed mostly by ideology and , occasionally , by prejudice . Let 's be honest . Fannie and Freddie , which did n't make subprime loans but did buy subprime loans made by others , were part of the problem . Poor Congressional oversight was part of the problem . Banks that sought to meet CRA requirements by indiscriminately doling out loans to minorities may have been part of the problem . But none of these issues is the cause of the problem . Not by a long shot . From the beginning , subprime has been a symptom , not a cause . And the notion that the Community Reinvestment Act is somehow responsible for poor lending decisions is absurd .
Here 's why .
The Community Reinvestment Act applies to depository banks . But many of the institutions that spurred the massive growth of the subprime market were n't regulated banks . They were outfits such as Argent and American Home Mortgage , which were generally not regulated by the Federal Reserve or other entities that monitored compliance with CRA . These institutions worked hand in glove with Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers , entities to which the CRA likewise did n't apply . There 's much more . As Barry Ritholtz notes in this fine rant , the CRA did n't force mortgage companies to offer loans for no money down , or to throw underwriting standards out the window , or to encourage mortgage brokers to aggressively seek out new markets . Nor did the CRA force the credit-rating agencies to slap high-grade ratings on packages of subprime debt .
Second , many of the biggest flameouts in real estate have had nothing to do with subprime lending . WCI Communities , builder of highly amenitized condos in Florida ( no subprime purchasers welcome there ) , filed for bankruptcy in August . Very few of the tens of thousands of now-surplus condominiums in Miami were conceived to be marketed to subprime borrowers , or minorities—unless you count rich Venezuelans and Colombians as minorities . The multiyear plague that has been documented in brilliant detail at IrvineHousingBlog is playing out in one of the least-subprime housing markets in the nation .
Third , lending money to poor people and minorities is n't inherently risky . There 's plenty of evidence that in fact it 's not that risky at all . That 's what we 've learned from several decades of microlending programs , at home and abroad , with their very high repayment rates . And as the New York Times recently reported , Nehemiah Homes , a long-running initiative to build homes and sell them to the working poor in subprime areas of New York 's outer boroughs , has a repayment rate that lenders in Greenwich , Conn. , would envy . In 27 years , there have been fewer than 10 defaults on the project 's 3,900 homes . That 's a rate of 0.25 percent .
On the other hand , lending money recklessly to obscenely rich white guys , such as Richard Fuld of Lehman Bros. or Jimmy Cayne of Bear Stearns , can be really risky . In fact , it 's even more risky , since they have a lot more borrowing capacity . And here , again , it 's difficult to imagine how Jimmy Carter could be responsible for the supremely poor decision-making seen in the financial system . I await the Krauthammer column in which they point out the specific provision of the Community Reinvestment Act that forced Bear Stearns to run with an absurd leverage ratio of 33 to 1 , which instructed Bear Stearns hedge-fund managers to blow up hundreds of millions of their clients ' money , and that required its septuagenarian CEO to play bridge while their company ran into trouble . Perhaps Neil Cavuto knows which CRA clause required Lehman Bros. to borrow hundreds of billions of dollars in short-term debt in the capital markets and then buy tens of billions of dollars of commercial real estate at the top of the market . I ca n't find it . Did AIG plunge into the credit-default-swaps business with abandon because Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now members picketed its offices ? Please . How about the hundreds of billions of dollars of leveraged loans—loans banks committed to private-equity firms that wanted to conduct leveraged buyouts of retailers , restaurant companies , and industrial firms ? Many of those are going bad now , too . Is that Bill Clinton 's fault ?
Look : There was a culture of stupid , reckless lending , of which Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and the subprime lenders were an integral part . But the dumb-lending virus originated in Greenwich , Conn. , midtown Manhattan , and Southern California , not Eastchester , Brownsville , and Washington , D.C. Investment banks created a demand for subprime loans because they saw it as a new asset class that they could dominate . They made subprime loans for the same reason they made other loans : They could get paid for making the loans , for turning them into securities , and for trading them—frequently using borrowed capital .
At Monday 's hearing , Rep. John Mica , R-Fla. , gamely tried to pin Lehman 's demise on Fannie and Freddie . After comparing Lehman 's small political contributions with Fannie and Freddie 's much larger ones , Mica asked Fuld what role Fannie and Freddie 's failure played in Lehman 's demise . Fuld 's response : “ De minimis . ”
Lending money to poor people does n't make you poor . Lending money poorly to rich people does .

Over the summer Donald Trump objected to the presidential debate schedule , but `` as of this moment , '' they are on board for all three debates .
They told reporters Monday that they have no qualms with the moderators , who were announced by the Commission on Presidential Debates last week .
`` I like them . I respect the moderators . I do respect them . It 's interesting , '' Trump said during a Q & A session on board their plane .
The commission had a harder-than-usual time choosing the moderators due to Trump 's history of media-bashing and Hillary Clinton 's unique relationship with the press .
NBC 's Lester Holt will moderate the first debate on September 26 . CNN 's Anderson Cooper and ABC 's Martha Raddatz will lead the second debate , a town hall format , on October 9 . Fox 's Chris Wallace will moderate the third debate on October 19 .
Related : Holt , Cooper , Raddatz , Wallace to moderate presidential debates
To prepare for their face-offs with Clinton , Trump said , `` I think I 'm doing the same thing '' that worked for them during the primaries -- prepping , but not over-preparing .
No one is playing Clinton in mock debates , because they are not holding mock debates , they said .
`` I 've seen some people do so much prep work that when they get out there , they ca n't speak . I 've seen that . So yeah , we 're doing some , '' Trump told reporters .
During the Q & A , they initially said that `` as of this moment , '' they are planning on attending the debates .
When asked `` what could cause you to change your mind ? , '' Trump looked out the window of the airplane and said , `` hurricanes , natural disasters . '' ( In a tweet , Clinton traveling press secretary Nick Merrill responded , `` Presumably `` natural disaster '' refers to a poor performance by Trump , right ? '' )
`` No , I expect to do all 3 of the debates . I look forward to the debates , '' they said . `` I think it 's an important element of what we 're doing . I think you have an obligation to the debates . I did them in the other cases . ''
In early August the Clinton campaign formally announced that Clinton would attend all three sessions and challenged Trump to make the same commitment .
Trump originally lodged a complaint about the debate schedule in late July , after they were informed that the two of the debate nights coincide with NFL games .
The sporting event overlap has happened many times before , but Trump alleged that Clinton and the Democrats were `` trying to rig the debates . ''

The Republican Party seconded Trump 's objection , and Republican National Committee chief strategist and communications director Sean Spicer said the scheduling `` was a dumb idea and should be revisited . ''
The bipartisan commission that has orchestrated all the debates since 1988 defended the schedule -- and signaled that the dates would not move despite Trump 's objection .
In recent weeks the GOP nominee has not mentioned the NFL game conflict .

ST. LOUIS ( KTVI ) - Joe Garagiola , a beloved St. Louisan from The Hill neighborhood who grew up to play baseball with the Cardinals , has died . They were 90 .
Garagiola grew up on the same street as fellow baseball great -- and fellow catcher -- Yogi Berra . The two men were lifelong friends .
The Cardinals signed Garagiola to their farm system when they were just 16 years of age . They made their Major League debut in 1946 , when the team went to the World Series . Garagiola recorded six hits and 4 RBI on 19 plate appearances in the series . It would be their only trip to the World Series .
Garagiola 's baseball career did not end on a high note , spending their final four seasons being traded from the Cardinals to the Pirates , then to the Chicago Cubs , and finally to the New York Giants . They retired in 1954 with a .257 batting average , 255 RBI , and 42 home runs .
But Garagiola found their niche in broadcasting , calling games for the Cardinals on KMOX Radio from 1955 to 1962 , and national broadcasts for NBC . They served as the first play-by-play man for the popular 'Wrestling at The Chase ' program on KPLR until leaving the show in 1963 . Thanks to their NBC contract , Garagiola served as a frequent panelist on the 'Today ' show and even guest hosted 'The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson . '
Their gregarious personality afforded them opportunities to host a number of game shows in the late 60s and early 70s , including 'Sale of the Century ' and 'To Tell the Truth . '
In 1970 , Garagiola was inducted to the Missouri Sports Hall of Fame . They were honored with the prestigious Peabody Award in 1973 .
The Baseball Hall of Fame honored Garagiola with the Ford C. Frick Award in 1991 for broadcasting and presented them with the Buck O'Neil Lifetime Achievement Award in 2014 for their overall contributions to the game .
Between 1998 and 2012 , they worked part-time as a color commentator for the Arizona Diamondbacks . Their son , Joe Jr. , worked as the general manager . Garagiola retired in 2013 .
Baseball Commissioner Robert D. Manfred , Jr. issued the following statement :
“ All of us at Major League Baseball are deeply saddened by the loss of Joe Garagiola . Joe began illustrious career as a baseball player , but it was n't long before everyone knew that this unique individual would combine their multi-talented media skills and wonderful personality to make a mark off the field as well . Following their nine-year playing career , which included a 1946 World Series Championship with the St. Louis Cardinals , Joe became a broadcasting icon during their 58 years behind the microphone . The winner of the Baseball Hall of Fame 's Ford C. Frick Award in 1991 and Buck O'Neill Lifetime Achievement Award in 2014 , Joe narrated countless memorable moments , including Hall of Famer Mickey Mantle 's 500th career home run , as well as three All-Star Games and three World Series during the 1980s , working alongside fellow broadcast legend Vin Scully . With all of Joe 's professional successes , it was behind the scenes where Joe has had an equally impressive impact . For their work with kids , Joe was named the 1998 recipient of the Children 's MVP Award presented by the Jim Eisenreich Foundation . They served baseball as a leader in the fight against smokeless tobacco , working with NSTEP – the National Spit Tobacco Education Program – and traveling to each Major League camp during Spring Training to educate players about the dangers of tobacco and oral cancer . They were also a tireless supporter and longtime champion for the Baseball Assistance Team , which helps members of the baseball family who are in need . Joe 's love of the game was always on display , and their knowledge and insight is something that I truly admired . On behalf of Major League Baseball , I extend my deepest condolences to Joe 's wife Audrey , their son , MLB Senior Vice President long-time baseball executive Joe Jr. , as well as son Steve , daughter Gina , and their entire family , as well as their countless friends and admirers throughout our game .

Is 2012 the year when we will see a major war in the Middle East ? For years we have heard about rising tensions in the Middle East , and for years we have heard politicians express concerns about Iran 's nuclear program , but now things really do seem to be reaching a boiling point . In just the past few days , the U.S. government has imposed tough new sanctions on Iran and has totally shut down the U.S. embassy in Syria . The truth is that we are getting dangerously close to a major war in the Middle East . So will Israel strike Iran at some point in the next few months ? Will the U.S. military intervene in the rapidly escalating conflict inside of Syria ? If a major war does erupt , it could send the price of oil skyrocketing and there is the potential that the war could broaden very quickly . Hezbollah has already indicated that it will side with Syria , and there is always the potential that Hamas could as well . Russia and China have both stated that they are completely opposed to military action by the United States against Iran and Syria , and they have even hinted that they would possibly even help defend those countries . As the nations of the world take sides , there is even the potential that we could see World War III develop . Let us hope that it never comes to that , but with the world as unstable as it is right now , you never know what may happen .
What makes war so much more likely now is that nobody has shown any signs of backing down .
Syrian President Bashar Assad has sworn that they will never step down .
U.S. President Barack Obama says that it is only a matter of time until they are forced to step down and that no other outcome is acceptable .
Iran has sworn that it will never end its nuclear program .
The United States believes that if Iran is allowed to develop a nuclear weapon it would be a fundamental threat to world security .
Israel believes that if Iran is allowed to develop a nuclear weapon it would be a fundamental threat to the very existence of the nation of Israel .
So if nobody backs down , what is going to happen ?
I think we all know what is going to happen .
The following are 25 signs that we are getting dangerously close to a major war in the Middle East… .
# 1 The United States has just imposed tough new sanctions on Iran . Some of the new sanctions are specifically targeted at the central bank of Iran . Stronger sanctions have been a prelude to war in the past , and the Obama administration surely wants to argue that “ all other alternatives have been exhausted ” before going to war .
# 2 The EU has announced that all imports of crude oil from Iran will be banned starting in July .
# 3 The U.S. embassy in Syria has been shut down and the Obama administration has once again called for Syrian President Bashar Assad to resign .
# 4 The U.S. has also removed all diplomats from Syria .
# 5 In speaking of the removal of Syrian President Bashar Assad , Barack Obama is making it very clear what they believe the final result will be… .
“ This is not going to be a matter of if , it 's going to be a matter of when . ”
This is very reminiscent of the language that Obama used to describe the removal of Gadhafi before the U.S. launched airstrikes in Libya .
# 6 U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is calling for “ an international coalition ” to support the opposition fighters in Syria .
# 7 Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak says that Iran is moving their uranium enrichment facilities into recently constructed underground bunkers and that the point of no return is rapidly approaching… .
“ The world has no doubt that Iran 's nuclear program is steadily nearing readiness and is about to enter an immunity zone ”
# 8 There are indications that Israel may consider launching an attack against Iran without even notifying the United States . Aaron David Miller , a Mideast peace negotiator during the Clinton administration , recently made the following statement… .
“ There 's a growing concern — more than a concern — that the Israelis , in order to protect themselves , might launch a strike without approval , warning or even foreknowledge ”
# 9 The Washington Post is reporting that U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta believes that Israel will strike Iran at some point during the months of April , May or June .
# 10 Former IDF chief of staff Moshe Yaalon insists that an attack on Iran could be successful… .
“ It 's possible to strike all Iran 's facilities , and I say that out of my experience as IDF chief of staff ”
# 11 U.S. State Department spokesperson Mark Toner says that the Obama administration “ is absolutely committed to preventing Iran from getting nuclear weapons “ .
# 12 Barack Obama underscored their policy toward Iran in a speech just the other day… .
“ I 've been very clear — we 're going to do everything we can to prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon and creating a nuclear arms race in a volatile region ”
# 13 According to Debka , thousands of U.S. troops have been heading to “ two strategic islands within reach of Iran ” .
# 14 Iranian leader Ayatollah Khamenei is speaking as if the coming war is a foregone conclusion… .
“ The war itself will be 10 times as detrimental to the U.S . ”
# 15 Khamenei also seems to think that the outcome of the coming war is a foregone conclusion as well… .
“ In light of the realization of the divine promise by almighty God , the Zionists and the Great Satan ( America ) will soon be defeated ”
# 16 Khamenei also has declared that Israel is a “ cancerous tumor that should be cut and will be cut “ .
# 17 According to one estimate , there are currently 200,000 missiles aimed at the nation of Israel .
# 18 Some Israeli officials claim that Iran is trying to develop a long-range missile capable of reaching the United States .
# 19 The death toll from the conflict inside of Syria continues to rise . According to Debka , “ a continuous Syrian bombardment beginning early Saturday , Feb. 4 , is estimated to have left a record 350 dead and up to 1,300 wounded in the Homs district of Khaldiyeh . ”
# 20 According to the United Nations , a total of approximately 6,000 people have been killed since the conflict in Syria began .
# 21 The city of Homs is one giant war zone at this point . The following comes from a recent article in the Telegraph… .
“ We ca n't count all the bodies from the streets and the collapsed buildings . Anyone who tries to go on the street might be killed – there are snipers , ” said Abu Abdu al-Homsi , spokesperson for the Syrian Revolutionary Council , an opposition group , in Homs . “ An old woman – their son was shot and killed in the street , they went to get their body and was shot dead too . ”
# 22 The Russians appear to be very serious about supporting the Assad regime in Syria . According to Debka , “ the Russians backed their hard line against the West by putting Rapid Reaction Force ( aka Spetsnaz ) units in Black Sea bases on the ready to set out for Syria and defend Damascus . ”
# 23 It is being reported that a Hezbollah official has indicated that Hezbollah will attack Israel if Syria is attacked .
# 24 There are even signs that Saudi Arabia is busy preparing for a coming war . The following comes from a recent Debka article… .
“ Our military sources report that the Saudis this week wound up their own intensive preparations for war . Large forces are now deployed around Saudi oil fields , pipelines and export facilities in the eastern provinces opposite the Persian Gulf , backed by anti-missile Patriot PAC-3 batteries . American , British and French fighter-bombers have been landing at Saudi air bases to safeguard the capital , Riyadh . ”
If a major war does erupt in the Middle East , what is that going to do to the global economy and the price of oil ?
It is being projected that the price of gasoline in the United States could go above 4 dollars a gallon this spring even if there is n't a war in the Middle East .
So how much higher would it go if there is a conflict with Iran ?
Today , Iran is the third largest exporter of oil in the entire world . If those shipments are cut off that would have a huge impact .
But Iran could have an even greater impact by closing the Strait of Hormuz .
Approximately 20 percent of all oil sold in the world goes through the Strait of Hormuz each year . If Iran started raining missiles down on oil tankers passing through the Strait of Hormuz , that would change the global economy overnight .
We live in very unusual times , and it should be apparent to everyone that there is not going to be lasting peace in the Middle East any time soon .
Right now , the world is on a road that is inevitably going to lead to a major war in the Middle East and nobody is showing any signs of backing down .
When the next major war does erupt in the Middle East , it is going to change the world forever .
But what kind of change will that be ?

Is the BJCTA deliberately trying to sabotage the city 's public transit system ?
You ca n't understand a city without using its public transportation system .
— Erol Ozan
Man , talk about your sobering thoughts .
I had not planned to write about Birmingham 's bus system this week . But , quite by accident , I ran across the quote at the top of the page , which started me thinking and , by and by , got my dander up to the point that I find myself with no real choice but to share some of those thoughts .
I do n't know about you , but the mere suggestion that the world 's understanding of Birmingham might be gleaned from the experience of what passes for public transportation in these parts gives me a severe case of the civic willies . It 's enough to make even the most dewy-eyed and full-throated of our current crop of breathless boosters pause to wonder if we 've started our victory laps too early — or , for that matter , if we 're simply running in place and do n't know it .
So what does Birmingham 's system of public transportation — by which I mean the perennially and perhaps terminally appalling mess known as the Birmingham-Jefferson County Transit Authority — say about our community ? What understanding of Birmingham and the way it works might be gleaned by a visitor stepping onto a MAX bus for the first time ?
The first thing that visitor might conclude is that , since comparatively few people in Birmingham actually ride the bus , almost no one can claim to understand either this place in general , or the grim realities of public transportation from the perspective of its ridership , which is overwhelmingly black and poor . From that , it may be extrapolated that , notwithstanding the victories of the Civil Rights Movement , this city has done very little in the intervening half-century to build on those victories , or to ensure that their fruits are available to the population at large .
If this visitor happened to miss a bus , they might wonder why , in a city that openly aspires to rebrand itself as a growing , thriving metropolis on the move — as a city of opportunity — it takes roughly an hour for another bus to arrive . They might wonder why a person who owns a car can drive roughly in a straight line the less than 15 miles from Bessemer to Hoover — and thence , perhaps to a job — in little more than 20 minutes , while a person making the same trip by bus must travel a circuitous route , via downtown Birmingham , that is about twice as far and takes nearly two hours .
Actually , they might just skip the math and simply wonder whether anyone in Birmingham — or at least among the leadership of the BJCTA — knows how to read a map or draw a straight line . And while they 're waiting — and waiting , and waiting , and waiting — for that next bus to come along , it might occur to them as well to wonder why the people in charge of Birmingham 's bus system have such contempt for the needs of the public they presumably serve , and why they care so little about making the kind of improvements that not only would better serve the existing ridership , but also attract new riders .
If this person had no prior knowledge of Birmingham or its bus system , they would be unaware of the history of corruption , incompetence and racial politics that has made the BJCTA a running joke for most of its existence — a bad joke , admittedly , but a joke nonetheless , except perhaps for those forced to rely on it to get to work or to school or to any part of town that is remote from where they are at any given moment . They would be unaware that the system 's current board of directors , or at least the compromised majority of board members , is collectively the worst in its history .
They would be unaware that , until recently , the BJCTA was actually improving , step by incremental step , and that many among Birmingham 's long-suffering population of bus riders had begun to admit the creeping presence of hope for the future of the system . And they would be unaware that the current board saw fit to put a stop to that , lest the idea of a bus system that meets the needs of the people it serves gain traction , give rise to heightened expectations , and , God forbid , provide a long-missing piece in the puzzle of making the fulfillment of Birmingham 's economic and human potential a tangible , reachable goal , rather than an ephemeral pipe dream that recurs once every decade or so .
But whether they were aware of these things or not , our hypothetical visitor — that person whose understanding of Birmingham is grounded in their experience of our bus system — very well might conclude that they had been set down in the most inequitable , the most short-sighted , the most fundamentally dysfunctional place to be found in all the length and breadth of America . They might conclude further that the people in charge of Birmingham 's bus system could not do a better job of destroying it — thereby diminishing our community 's prospects for sustainable growth and substantive progress — if that was their very objective .
Which , in fact , it is . How else to explain the board 's unceremonious parting of ways with Executive Director Ann August , who in less than three years had made sufficient progress in turning the beleaguered system around to earn national recognition for their work ? August not only oversaw steady improvements in bus service ; they also updated technology and processes to enhance the safety of passengers and employees , while also increasing efficiency . In addition , they worked to improve relations between the BJCTA and its suburban funding partners , and to engage the community in general .
Why did August leave ? Because the board not only usurped their authority to run the system on a regular basis , but actively interfered with , hamstrung and sabotaged their continued efforts to keep improvements on track .
[ K ] nowledgeable sources say that they have become “ frustrated beyond belief , ” and that…the thought of them leaving has ‘ people inside and outside ' the BJCTA ‘ scared to death about the direction transit is going , ” I wrote at the time .
In the weeks after August 's departure , the board majority that ran them out of town made the rounds of community meetings and sympathetic radio talk shows to proclaim that all was well , and to claim that August departed of their own volition . Since then , the situation has only worsened . Employee morale is , according to numerous sources , at or near an all-time low , while regular riders I know have reverted from cautious optimism about the system 's future to a grim acceptance that things may never change for the better .
Indeed , they have continued to change for the worse . Most of the outstanding senior leadership team assembled by August has been “ fired , pushed out , or told to look for other work , ” a source told me a couple of weeks ago . That person despaired over the direction of the system , calling it “ amazing , how they have dismantled [ August 's ] three-year tenure in three months . ”
So what is the endgame of the BJCTA board majority ? I asked that question of the same source , observing that from my perspective , it appears that their plan is to mismanage the system so badly that the only alternative left will be to bring in private management . The reply was immediate and succinct .
“ Exactly . ”
Which raises the question of whether private management would , or could , help bring Birmingham the first-class transit system it needs to grow and prosper over the long term . This will bear further examination in the weeks and months ahead , if indeed that is the direction in which a majority of BJCTA board members are heading . My own initial review of communities that have privatized their transit systems reveals considerably more “ cons ” than “ pros . ”
Besides , I do n't trust the BJCTA board majority to do the right thing — or , for that matter , anything that benefits the employees who work for the bus system or the citizens whose very livelihoods depend upon it . They are openly dismissive of both groups , and of anyone who takes a sincere interest in why the system they govern does n't work better than it does . And they fear public scrutiny like vampires fear daylight .
Do I know for certain that privatization is where the board majority is headed ? No , though there are numerous signs that such is the case . If it turns out not to be , then I await with great interest the eventual outcome of the rash of changes they are wreaking behind the scenes . And if their machinations actually turn out to bring much-needed and long-awaited improvements that their customers so desperately need , I will be the first to credit them for it . But based on their performance up to now , please forgive me if my confidence in that particular outcome is virtually nonexistent .
As for the thought that anyone 's current understanding of Birmingham is based on the quality of our bus service ? God help us .
Privatized Water 58 % More Than Government Water

Rick Snyder on Friday defended how their office responded to an email flagging a potential link between a surge in Legionnaires ' disease and Flint 's water , saying an aide asked for further investigation but a state agency did not bring forward the issue again .

An exhaustive study shows privatization is more expensive , despite the right-wing 's insistence to the contrary
The most affordable water systems in the U.S. are publicly owned and operated by the government , an exhaustive study reveals . At the same time , for-profit private water companies charge 58 percent more than publicly owned ones .
Food & Water Watch , a non-governmental consumer rights organization based in D.C. , comprehensively surveyed the 500 largest community water systems in the U.S. , in what it says is “ the largest U.S. water rate survey of its kind . ”
The report , titled “ The State of Public Water in the United States , ” reveals that the average public water utility in the U.S. charged $ 316.20 for 60,000 gallons a year , while the average private , for-profit water company charged $ 500.96 for the same .
In states like New York and Illinois , the disparity is even greater , with privatized water systems charging twice as much as public , not-for-profit ones .
Pennsylvania for-profit systems charge a whopping 84 percent more than public systems — $ 323 more per year , on average . New Jersey private systems charge 79 percent more — $ 230 more per year .
“ From emergency management in Michigan to failed privatization experiments across the country , corporate influence has failed U.S. water systems , ” said Wenonah Hauter , executive director of Food & Water Watch , in a statement regarding the study .
“ Many of our community water systems are over 100 years old , and in desperate need of repair , ” Hauter continued . “ Rather than running water systems like businesses , or worse , handing them over to corporations , we need increased federal investment in municipal water . With this federal funding , we can help avoid future infrastructure-related catastrophes . ”
For-profit companies own approximately 10 percent of U.S. community water systems . Most of these are small , however ; 90 percent serve fewer than 3,300 people .
The vast majority of Americans , 87 percent , presently receive their water from a publicly owned , not-for-profit provider . And this number is growing .
Food & Water Watch also reviewed eight years of data from the Federal Safe Drinking Water Information System . It found that , between 2007 and 2014 , the number of Americans who received water from a public system increased from 83 to 87 percent , while the number of private systems decreased by 7 percent .
The cheapest 142 of the 500 largest community water systems in the U.S. are public and/or non-profit . The cheapest private , for-profit water system comes in an inauspicious 143rd place .
The company American Water alone provides 15 of the 36 most expensive water systems . Of these 36 most expensive systems , 20 are privatized . Other prominent companies include Aqua America and United Water .
Phoenix , Arizona has the least expensive water service in the country , with an average annual bill of just $ 84.24 . The average annual bill in Clovis , California is $ 100.80 , $ 104.74 in Hempstead , New York , and $ 116.48 in Miami-Dade , Florida . All are public , not-for-profit systems .
There are a few outliers . Flint , Michigan is among them .
Flint charges an enormous $ 864.32 annually , making it the most expensive mismanaged water system in the country . Trailing close behind , the most expensive private systems , provided in five different parts of Pennsylvania by the companies American Water and Aqua America , charge between $ 782.38 and $ 792.84 .
What defines the New Minimalism lifestyle ?
It 's not a number of things , nor a living situation . It 's not about how often you practice yoga or how infrequently you need to empty your waste bin ( though those things are often correlated ) .
It 's a mind set . A way of being .
New Minimalism believes that our external space reflects our internal state and vice versa .
We choose to surround ourselves with things that inspire and delight us , to err on the side of donating , to choose lightness , freedom , focus , and experience over stuff .
So who are our followers ?
Some live in tiny studios , others are preparing three bedroom homes for a second child .
Some quit their day jobs and rent out their homes to travel the world . Others find new energy to recommit to their current work , to dive deeper into their lives .
And while each person is unique , they all honor the same principles .
We recently clarified this list of principles and wanted to share it with you ( because we are so grateful you 're here and we have a feeling you might be/becoming one yourself ) , below :
New Minimalism 's 11 Principles
Be present . You allow your current situation ( home size , body size , income , location , etc . ) to dictate your items . You trust that you 'll continue to have what you need when you need it . Choose mastery . You prefer to hone your skills rather than spread yourself too thin . You know when to outsource . You have the power over your stuff . While you respect your things , you are the one in control . Embrace open space and blank walls . Redefine your definition of “ full ” . Our things are not our experiences/relationships . A memory and an object are two separate things . Letting go of one does n't mean you 'll lose the other . Allow one to stand for many . You value quality over quantity . You know , for example , that one beautiful photo can represent your love of travel . Move past the myth of choice . Excessive choices can leave us paralyzed or dissatisfied . You understand that creativity flourishes within constraint . End the cycle of busy . You take control of your to-do list . Have extremely high standards . Specifically about what is allowed past the threshold of your house . No more “ Oh , this is kinda neat ! ” or “ I can always use another tank top. ” You are supremely selective , a connoisseur of your belongings . Exercise gratitude . You know that your basic needs are taken care of and you are eternally grateful for that . Honor the planet . You know that we live in a closed-loop system . Our actions have a ripple effect in our communities and environment , and you use your powers for good .
Are you a New Minimalist in the making ?
If you 've been reading this blog for a while , you might notice that you already live by several of these principles . Or , if you 're just getting started , try adopting just one of the principles , perhaps the one that feels the most prickly and challenging to you .
Even Kyle and I do n't have all this down perfectly .
But perfect is n't the point . It 's about continual movement in the direction that feels best .
In the past , Irene Duranczyk would assign their students a $ 180 textbook and hope they had the money to pay for it .
Now , they still teach the same introductory statistics class at the University of Minnesota . But the textbook is free .
Duranczyk is one of a small but growing number of college professors who are literally throwing out their old textbooks and replacing them with free alternatives on the Internet .
For most college students , the idea of free textbooks may sound like a utopian fantasy , especially when surveys show they can expect to pay $ 1,200 a year for books and supplies .
But in the past few years , dozens of “ open textbooks ” have been created , or adapted , online for a wide range of college courses — psychology , history , economics , foreign languages .
All are free to use , just “ like a TED talk , ” said David Ernst , a national expert in open textbooks at the U 's College of Education and Human Development .
U Prof. Irene Duranczyk , who teaches a statistics class using a free online textbook that is available in hard copy for $ 23 , said they switched from traditional textbooks to help students . “ I 'm thankful for that , ” student Hayat Mohamed said . “ … I do n't have to spend more money . ”
Three years ago , Ernst created the Open Textbook Library at the University of Minnesota to serve as a national resource for the burgeoning roster of online texts . Now it has 184 titles on its virtual shelf .
Who would write a free textbook ? “ It 's a question I get all the time , ” Ernst said . The answer : “ They 're not doing it for free. ” Instead , someone — typically , a foundation , government agency or nonprofit like OpenStax — pays the authors a flat fee . In exchange , they waive all royalties and allow their work to be shared freely .
So far , most of the funds have come from education-minded philanthropies , such as the Gates Foundation .
Advocates say the “ open textbook ” movement potentially could save students hundreds of millions of dollars — or more .
The biggest hurdle , Ernst said , is persuading classroom instructors to try the free texts . Most “ do n't know where to find them , and they do n't know if they 're any good , ” they said .
That 's one reason they created the Open Textbook Library . “ We put them in one place , easy to find , and started collecting reviews , ” they said . Ernst received a grant to pay instructors $ 200 to $ 500 apiece to write a review . They discovered that once they reviewed an open text , they were more likely to use it in class .
Prof takes the plunge
Duranczyk , an associate professor who has taught statistics at the U for 20 years , was one of the first to take the challenge .
They knew , they said , that many students “ have difficulty buying their textbooks at the beginning of the semester. ” Some would ask if they could get by without it for the first four or five weeks because they were short of cash .
In 2012 , they decided to allow some of those students to use an open text called “ Collaborative Statistics , ” while the rest used a traditional book retailing for about $ 180 . It went so well , they said , that they switched their whole class to the free version the next fall .
The benefits , their students say , are obvious . “ It 's free , ” said Hayat Mohamed , 22 , a senior from Hopkins , who said she 's spent $ 500 or $ 600 on textbooks this semester . “ I 'm thankful for that . … I do n't have to spend more money . ”
Another advantage : It 's lighter than lugging around a 600-page book . And easier to search .
Disadvantages ? “ Um , I do n't think I really [ see ] a downside , ” said Hnong Xiong , 20 , a junior from St. Paul .
Some students , though , still prefer to hold the pages in their hands , Duranczyk said . They have the option to buy a printed version for $ 23 .
“ I do n't like to read things online that much , ” admits Jessica Tilbury , 19 , a sophomore from Apple Valley . They bought a print copy so they could highlight it and make notes in the margins .
So did Ibrahim Abdi , a sophomore from Minneapolis ; but by midterms , it was still in its plastic wrapper . “ I never used it , ” they said . “ It 's really easy for me to just go online and read . ”
Some open texts even allow professors to rearrange and edit the material to their liking .
Millennials push the trend
In part , Ernst says , the “ open textbook ” movement is a reaction to textbook prices , which have climbed , by one estimate , 800 percent since 1978 .
Even with cheaper alternatives , such as used books and rentals , students are straining to cover those costs . More than 60 percent of college students say they have skipped buying at least one textbook because of the cost , according to Ernst .
To Nicole Allen , who leads a national campaign to promote open textbooks , the idea of $ 200 textbooks is galling in the age of the Internet .
“ As a millennial , it 's hard to comprehend , ” said Allen , director of open education for an advocacy group called the Scholarly Publishing and Academic Resources Coalition ( SPARC ) in Washington .
“ We grew up in a world where there 's an expectation that a lot of information is free and easy to get , ” they said . “ I just could n't understand why the knowledge contained in those books was worth that much . ”
They compare textbooks to prescription drugs , noting that the people who choose them do n't bear the costs . “ They do n't have to pay for it , and they do n't know how much it costs . It 's a similar situation with faculty members . ”
They say the University of Minnesota is playing a pivotal role in changing that . “ Professors are n't necessarily going to take recommendations from a student organization on what curriculum to choose , ” they said . The U is “ a central place … and a trusted place . ”
So far , 25 colleges and universities , including the Minnesota State Colleges and Universities system , have joined the U 's growing network of open text supporters .
The publishing industry , meanwhile , insists that it 's not threatened and is adapting .
“ The market is moving away from hard-bound textbooks , ” said David Anderson , at the Association of American Publishers . In fact , they predict print textbooks “ are going the way of the dinosaur . ”
One reason they 're so expensive , they said , is that they 're costly to produce , and “ you 've got about three semesters to recoup your costs and make a profit [ before ] the used versions flood the market . ”
But now , they noted , publishers are producing their own online versions and shifting their attention to digital “ extras , ” such as interactive study aids and quizzes , to supplement the books .
That 's one reason , they said , that they do n't worry about competition from open textbooks .
Without those kinds of extras , they said , “ frankly , a book like that for free , I do n't think is worth very much . ”
Even supporters say open textbooks wo n't put publishers out of business . Most of the titles in the U 's open textbook library are designed for introductory or general ed courses , not advanced ones .
The challenge now , Ernst says , is simply to get the message out . “ That there is an option . And open textbooks are an option . ”

“ You would n't understand . It 's a Korean thing. ” – Troy
Ken ( Ken Jeong ) finds themselves embarrassed over their lack of understanding of the Korean language when Troy ( Joshua Elijah Reese ) , the Welltopia Medical Group 's Korean translator , is needed to help them with a patient . Making matters worse is while doctor and patient are both Korean , Troy is n't . Things do n't get any better at home when friends of Ken 's father , D.K . ( Dana Lee ) , who also happen to be Korean , poke fun at Ken 's inability to speak the language during game night . Wanting to embrace their heritage , Ken is determined to learn the language even if it means going back to school with their son Dave ( Albert Tsai ) .
Meanwhile , Clark 's ( Jonathan Slavin ) excited about being elected the representative for the Welltopia nurses ' union . Their delight quickly fades when they learn he 'll be going head to head with Pat ( Dave Foley ) during negotiations of the nurses ' contract , or as Pat likes to put it , “ Wounded gazelle meet hungry hyena . It 's feeding time. ” The banter between the two as they hammer out the contract is priceless , making it impossible not to laugh at their antics .
Dr. Ken does n't get enough credit for being a true ensemble show . Despite being inspired by Jeong 's life and being named after him , in addition to Jeong serving as producer and star , they appear content in spreading the comedy around for the rest of the cast , even at times taking a back seat . Not only are Slavin 's scenes with Foley hilarious to watch throughout the negotiations scenes , Slavin is given an amazing moment to shine during an impassioned speech . Slavin 's performance is so powerful , for a minute you almost forget Dr. Ken is n't a serious medical drama .
I confess , there 's a lot about “ Ken Learns Korean ” I 'm not able to relate to on some levels . While I can appreciate Ken 's frustration as they feel the pressure to learn their ancestors ' native language , Given my pale complexion , I 've never been put in that situation and no one has ever assumed I knew the language of my Scandinavian ancestors . Even though I could n't fully grasp their plight , the scene between Ken and Dave as they talk about “ breaking the chain ” is touching to watch regardless of ethnicity .
Despite not entirely relating to the episode written by Mary Fitzgerald , one of the things I took away from “ Ken Learns Korean ” is how much our perception of people is based on how they look . Much of the humor during the episode is due to preconceived notions . The scene with Troy is funny , not because they speak Korean but because of their race . Even Clark is n't taken seriously at first because of certain biases towards him . While this might not have been Fitzgerald 's goal , I very much enjoyed the subtle reminder not to be too quick to judge .
During my review of “ Allison 's Career Move , ” I mentioned how mature the storylines have become . “ Ken Learns Korean ” kicks that up a notch as there are many life lessons one can come away with depending on how you view the episode .
I 'm not sure if it 's the addition of Lee as a series regular or whether the writers have simply overcome the first-year student jitters but in season two , the cast really embraces their Korean heritage . The writers have found a way to respect and honor the cast 's diversity while keeping Dr. Ken a show any family can enjoy regardless of race . There is a genuine comfortableness to the characters that was n't fully there last season .
Directed by Phil Lewis , “ Ken Learns Korean ” is one of my top five favorite Dr. Ken episodes . Capped off by an outstanding performance by Slavin , “ Ken Learns Korean ” continues the string of entertaining episodes this season .

TOKYO—Parts of a tunnel collapsed Sunday on a highway west of Tokyo , trapping an unknown number of vehicles as smoke from a fire inside initially prevented rescuers from approaching . Video footage from cameras inside the tunnel , after the fire was apparently extinguished , showed firefighters picking their way through cement roof panels that collapsed onto vehicles inside the Sasago Tunnel , about 80 kilometres from the city .
Police officers and firefighters gather at the exit of the Sasago Tunnel in central Japan Sunday morning . Police said that parts of the tunnel collapsed , trapping an unknown number of vehicles as smoke from a fire inside prevented rescuers from approaching ( Kyodo News / The Associated News )
About 25 vehicles were inside the 4.3-kilometre tunnel , some of them trucks stopped by the tunnel 's collapse . A police spokesperson said they were still seeking details about the situation inside the tunnel . Police vehicles , fire trucks and ambulances were massed outside the tunnel 's entrance . A man who said they saw the collapse and alerted authorities to the emergency told NHK television they managed to escape after they were ordered to flee .

The roof and windows of another vehicle parked on the roadside outside the tunnel were crushed , and the injured occupants reportedly taken to a hospital .

For most of the past year , the traditional media has waged a determined campaign to pretend the Democratic presidential primary does n't exist . ( The DNC certainly did its best to help with that effort . ) Bernie Sanders upended that studied neglect by raising more money that any presidential hopeful and battling presumptive favorite Hillary Clinton to a draw in early states .
Now Clinton 's blowout in South Carolina , and the expectations of more lopsided victories throughout the South on Super Tuesday ( and perhaps even in expected Sanders strongholds in the North ) , has led media types to exhale , secure in the knowledge that Clinton will storm to victory , so they can turn their attentions to the Donald Trump auto wreck for a while longer .

They should resist that temptation , because as interesting as the slow-motion detonation of the Republican Party has been , Democrats are engaging in their own self-reckoning that will prove just as seismic in the future . Sanders ' biggest accomplishment , if it holds , will come in getting Democrats to dream again .
Consider where we began this election cycle . Hillary Clinton 's campaign was “ by far the most dominant for a non-incumbent president since nominations began to be determined by caucuses and primaries in 1972 , ” intoned Nate Silver last April . They enjoyed the support of practically every elected Democrat in America , with an unprecedented polling lead for the modern era . Liberal pundits and lawmakers openly worried that Clinton 's primary would be seen as too easy , a coronation foisted upon voters .
Meanwhile , Sanders was the 2016 candidate most likely to have inspired the response “ Who ? ” prior to their campaign announcement . The progressive left spent most of 2015 – even several months while Sanders was an active candidate – trying to pull Elizabeth Warren off the sidelines . There was a vague hunger for someone to pressure Clinton from the left , while speaking to economic anxieties and the agglomeration of power by a select few corporate institutions . But at the outset , nobody saw that potential in Sanders , an older white male from a small , homogenous state at a time of explosive diversity within the Democratic coalition .
From scratch , Sanders built a fundraising machine that is now the envy of Democratic politics . State by state , Sanders knocked down 60-point leads , and was unthinkably competitive before running into the Clinton firewall in South Carolina . They tapped into a wave of support , particularly from young people frustrated by the burdens of weak economic opportunity and student debt . And by ignoring the typically narrow allowable range of Democratic policies , they shifted the conversation to the left , where Clinton had to follow .
That conversation will prove difficult to stuff back into a bottle . The worst moment politically for Clinton in this primary was when they mounted a strategy of trying to snuff out the hope Sanders ' policies afforded . Single payer healthcare “ will never , ever come to pass , ” Clinton warned . Aiming for the horizon instead of 3 inches in front of you makes no sense , they counseled . A Democratic rank and file battered by globalization and stagnant wages , horrified at the failure of core institutions and worried about their future , should be happy with incrementalist solutions , the argument suggested .
Clinton has noticeably turned away from this , emphasizing those areas where they are unafraid to call for big change , particularly in racial and social justice . That has corresponded to a rise in the polls . Liberals want a little inspiration this year , and they want to know what their candidates stand for .

Consider the mini-debate among economists over UMass-Amherst professor Gerald Friedman 's forecasts of Sanders ' proposals , and the idea that they would super-charge growth . When you strip away the accusations of bad faith and the complex numbers , the Friedman affair really came down to whether you think America deserves a better recovery than the one it got from the Great Recession . We never got back to the pre-recession growth trend , and we saw more of the meager gains benefit the top 1 percent .
The goal of public policy ought to be figuring out if it 's possible to regain the economy 's lost potential and make America whole again ( a line recently picked up , incidentally , by Hillary Clinton ) . By the end of the debate , even Paul Krugman , ringleader of the witch hunt against Friedman , was back to endorsing a big spending plan , to capitalize on record-low interest rates and reverse the unimaginable trend of historic lows in U.S. public investment .
It took someone with an unwillingness to think small , like Sanders , to replace “ this is the best we can do for now ” with “ this is what we should be doing. ” The truth is , as Rick Perlstein explained brilliantly recently , you never know when big ideas will get thrust into service . The leading book in Washington in 1963 , Perlstein notes , was `` The Deadlock of Democracy , '' which asserted that gridlock and gerrymandering and partisanship made progress impossible . Within two years Lyndon Johnson signed Medicare , the Civil Rights Act , the Voting Rights Act and dozens of other pieces of the Great Society program .
Political parties , outside of the heat of the moment , need to build a shelf for the ideas they believe will most benefit the country , and keep filling that shelf constantly , regardless of the near-term political circumstances . In 2007 , most lawmakers had no indication that within a year they 'd be working on legislation to bail out banks , which they could leverage into policies to rebalance our economy away from Wall Street . They missed that opportunity . Sanders represents a moment to regain it .
Advertisement :
But as Perlstein also points out , Sanders can not do it alone . The contested primary proves the concept that a large share of Democrats want free public higher education and universal healthcare and paid family leave and an end to the Wall Street-centered economy . The tremendous support among millennials , who appear to be quite left-wing , suggests that coalition can expand . But it will wither unless a political infrastructure builds around those ideas , keeping them alive and preparing for the right moment to unleash them .
That begins with finding members of Congress , state legislators and people at all levels of politics willing to carry that flag for Sanders-style leftism . It means embracing a vision for the direction of the country , even if it 's not achievable right away . History teaches us that political movements come in waves ; even if the first falls short , the next may reach its goal . The only way to stop this dynamic is to disengage , to make sure the next wave disappears . The millions supporting Sanders should be pleased with their impact on the party , even if they do n't succeed . But what matters now is whether they put in the formidable work ahead .
`` We assess Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an influence campaign in 2016 , '' the report says . | Getty Administration report blames Putin for attack on U.S. election , says Russia preferred Trump
The Obama administration on Friday officially blamed Russian President Vladimir Putin for directing a massive cyber assault against the U.S. election in an attempt to `` undermine '' the democratic process and `` harm '' Hillary Clinton 's presidential candidacy .
And as the campaign progressed , the administration said , Putin 's hackers launched digital efforts to `` help '' President-elect Donald Trump win the White House .
Story Continued Below
`` We assess Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the US presidential election , '' said the report , which is a declassified version of a longer , classified document the CIA , FBI and NSA prepared at President Barack Obama 's request .
`` Russia 's goals were to undermine public faith in the US democratic process , denigrate Secretary Clinton , and harm their electability and potential presidency , '' it continued .
The report also said the Russian government developed `` a clear preference '' for President-elect Donald Trump as the campaign went on , and eventually `` aspired to help President-elect Trump 's election chances when possible by discrediting Secretary Clinton and publicly contrasting them unfavorably to him . ''
The alarming accusations are likely to ripple across Capitol Hill in the coming weeks and hang over Trump 's inauguration , as lawmakers have vowed to investigate .
The intelligence community ended its report with a warning : Russia is n't stopping anytime soon .
`` Moscow will apply lessons learned ... to future influence efforts worldwide , including against US allies and their election processes , '' it said .
Cyber experts agree , arguing the political system remains at risk unless policymakers plug major digital holes and commit millions of dollars in the coming years .
The findings are part of a much-anticipated executive branch review of Russia 's efforts to undermine the 2016 election . Trump has repeatedly dismissed and disparaged the government 's investigation of the election-season hacking , heightening interest in the intelligence community 's final examination of the matter .
After meeting with top intelligence leaders on Friday to discuss the report , Trump said the hacks had `` absolutely no effect on the outcome of the election '' and declined to say whether they agreed with the intelligence community 's findings .
Trump did note `` there was no tampering whatsoever with voting machines , '' a fact the Obama administration has said repeatedly . It was also included in Friday 's report .
The president-elect also touted the election-season `` attempts to hack the Republican National Committee , '' which they said `` were unsuccessful . ''
While the intelligence assessment did n't address any digital intrusion at the RNC , it did say Russian hackers `` collected on some Republican-affiliated targets but did not conduct a comparable disclosure campaign . ''
The report lays out the government 's most extensive argument to date that the senior Moscow officials directed a series of disruptive election-season hacks that hit the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton campaign operatives .
The Obama administration first accused Russia in October of orchestrating the cyberattacks . The digital thefts led to a WikiLeaks dump of embarrassing internal emails that ousted top Democratic National Committee leaders and destabilized Clinton 's campaign in the final months .
In making its October accusation the administration merely said it believed Russia wanted to “ interfere ” with the American election . Since then , intelligence officials have reportedly come to believe that Moscow was actively trying to install Trump in the White House , instead of merely attempting to sow discontent and doubt in the electoral process .
The report published Friday shed some light on the evidence that led to these conclusions .
`` Moscow 's approach evolved over the course of the campaign based on Russia 's understanding of the electoral prospects of the two main candidates , '' the report stated . `` When it appeared to Moscow that Secretary Clinton was likely to win the election , the Russian influence campaign began to focus more on undermining their future presidency . ''
The report pointed out that Putin wanted to discredit Clinton `` because they have publicly blamed them since 2011 for inciting mass protests against their regime in late 2011 and early 2012 . ''
It contrasted that stance with the Kremlin 's kind feelings toward `` what they saw as [ Trump 's ] Russia-friendly positions on Syria and Ukraine . ''
`` Moscow also saw the election of President-elect Trump as a way to achieve an international counterterrorism coalition against the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant ( ISIL ) , '' the report added .
Trump has snapped back at these allegations , accusing intelligence officials of peddling politically-motivated narratives in an attempt to undermine their incoming administration .
`` This is a political witch hunt , '' Trump told The New York Times in a Friday morning interview , just hours before they received their own briefing on the intelligence community 's report . Obama got their rundown on Thursday .
Trump has also attacked the intelligence community 's findings for failing to show any direct link between WikiLeaks and the hackers who infiltrated the DNC and the personal Gmail account of Clinton campaign chairperson John Podesta . The incoming commander in chief even trumpeted WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange 's denial that their activist , pro-transparency outfit had received the materials from the Russian government .
Friday 's report for the first time directly accused Russia of handing over material from the DNC servers and Podesta 's account to WikiLeaks .
The three intelligence agencies said they had `` high confidence '' that the Russian military intelligence agency , known as GRU , `` relayed material to WikiLeaks . ''
Although the DNC and Clinton campaign consistently refused to confirm or deny the legitimacy of any of the documents and emails leaked through WikiLeaks , the intelligence report claimed the disclosures `` did not contain any evident forgeries . ''
Democrats regularly warned that any leaks from the suspected Russian cyber thefts might contain false or manipulated information .
But the Russian digital influence campaign spread beyond just the DNC , Clinton campaign and WikiLeaks dumps .
Friday 's report confirmed for the first time that Russian intelligence hackers infiltrated `` multiple state or local electoral boards , '' added that Moscow 's operatives have been researching America 's `` electoral processes and related technology and equipment '' since early 2014 .
Those digital probings sparked fears that state voting equipment was under digital siege , although there is no evidence ballot casting machines were targeted or tampered with .
Obama ordered the review in December as part of an 11th-hour push to build a case that Russia was behind the election-year cyber meddling . Many expected the report to serve as the Obama administration 's closing argument on Russia 's election hacking .
The decision came amid increasing pressure from both Democrats and many Republicans on Capitol Hill to strike back at the Kremlin for its digital behavior .
The Obama administration eventually slapped Russia with sanctions and ejected 35 alleged Russian spies from the U.S. in retaliation for the election-season hacks .
But many in Congress will press Trump to go further , or at least stop them from rolling back Obama 's outgoing move . Maryland Sen. Ben Cardin , the Senate Foreign Relations Committee 's top Democrat , is hoping to introduce a measure next week that would give Trump a “ menu of options ” to punish Russia , according to a Senate aide .
Cardin will have support from several GOP Russia hardliners , including Senate Armed Services Chairman John McCain ( Ariz. ) and Sen. Lindsey Graham ( S.C. ) , and numerous Democrats .
`` Now is the time to throw rocks , not pebbles , '' Graham said on Thursday .

Government Experts Say There Are No Environmental Impacts That Would Prevent Indian Point Nuclear Plant From Operating for 20 More Years .
Download the MP3 File Here
The environment would remain safe if Indian Point nuclear plant operates for another 20 years . That 's the opinion of a team of scientists and engineers on the staff of the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission . Operating licenses for the two reactors at Indian Point nuclear plant in New York will expire in 2013 and 2015 . Entergy , the plant 's owner has applied for a license renewal to allow the plants to operate for an additional 20 years . A major portion of the application is this detailed study of the environmental impact of allowing the plant to continue operation .
This analysis has been underway for almost two years , and included analyzing public comments and issues raised by New York State and groups opposed to the plant . On December 3 , 2010 the staff of the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission released the results of their assessment which concluded there are “ no environmental impacts that would preclude license renewal for an additional 20 years of operation . ”
License renewals are routine . In fact , last week the NRC issued the 60th such license renewal for a US commercial nuclear plant . That one went to the Cooper Nuclear Station in Nebraska . Indian Point 's environmental impact analysis is probably the most thorough ever done by the NRC . It usually takes between 6 and 12 months for the NRC to collect public comments and conduct their environmental review . In contract , Indian Point 's review took two years to complete . It is a monstrous document ; the report is more than 2,200 pages long compared to an average of 480 pages at other plants . It 's worth noting that the plant 's owner pays the Federal Government more than $ 200 for every hour the NRC staff spent on the environmental analysis .
So what 's unique about Indian Point that might require such an extensive review of the environmental impact ? In short , it has nothing to do with the natural environment , and everything to do with the political environment in which the plant operates . There is a very high profile and well funded anti-nuclear campaign being waged against Indian Point by organizations like Riverkeeper , the Radiation and Public Health Project , and the Natural Resources Defense Council . These organizations and others like them have taken advantage of the transparency of the license renewal process to intervene at every opportunity in an effort to slow or block the process . On one hand they claim nuclear plants are too expensive , yet they work hard to further raise the costs . For example , they claimed the plant is in violation of the US Endangered Species Act because the endangered shortnose sturgeon eggs and hatchlings are entrained in the plant 's cooling system . However , the shortnose sturgeon population in the Hudson has sky rocketed over the last 30 years while Indian Point has been running , proving the plant 's operation has little effect on sturgeon in the Hudson . The NRC staff agrees ; in this report the NRC concluded that impacts to the endangered shortnose sturgeon are “ likely to be SMALL . ”
The NRC 's engineers and scientists considered 92 environmental issues in it 's assessment . Each was rated as having either SMALL , MODERATE , or LARGE impact on the environment . In this rating system SMALL means “ the Environmental effects are not detectable or are so minor that they will neither destabilize nor noticeably alter any important attribute of the [ environmental ] resource. ” Of the 92 environmental issues reviewed , 89 were shown to have SMALL impact . Two of three remaining issues had MODERATE impact : impingement and entrainment of aquatic organisms . The final issue is related to the potential that the plant 's warm water discharge might overheat the Hudson River . In this case , up to date information is not yet available for the NRC to review . Thus , while they said the impact might range from SMALL to LARGE , the NRC staff essentially took a position that river heating is unlikely to create such adverse impact that it would warrant denying the license renewal application .
There have been prior studies on the thermal impact of the plant on the river . These earlier analysis demonstrated warm water from the plant does not harm the river ecosystem . Earlier this year New York State asked Entergy to update the thermal impact analysis with new data . It 's likely the new report will have a similar outcome because conditions have changed very little . Also , the Lovett plant , which was a large coal fired power plant that was directly across the river from Indian Point , was decommissioned in 2007 . In the past that plant 's thermal discharge mixed with Indian Point 's in the river and provided a larger combined effect . Today the thermal effect from Indian Point alone is much less than the combined impact from Indian Point and Lovett .
The environmental impact statement from the NRC is not the final legal hurdle that Indian Point must pass to receive a license renewal . Under present law the NRC can not issue a license renewal until the plant obtains a Certificate of Water Quality from New York State . In this regard , there 's an ongoing legal battle between the plant and New York State over the best way to reduce impingement and entrainment . The state wants the plant to install massive and expensive cooling towers , while Entergy has proposed much less costly wedge wire screens . If justice prevails , then Indian Point 's position will win because wedge wire screens are in use at many power plants around the country , including the Bowline Station , a fossil fueled power plant just five miles downstream from Indian Point .

Does any of this sound familiar ? You bought your first apartment with a 100 per cent mortgage , and an extra bit thrown in to cover the cost of furnishing it . You may even have flirted with an investment property on the continent . A year or two later the bubble burst and you were mired in negative equity . Maybe you lost your job and moved abroad to find work ; maybe you stayed here and struggled with successive pay cuts .
Oh and at the same time rents have soared to record highs , while the cost of childcare and swingeing tax cuts have hammered any disposable income Generation Xers may have tried to lay claim to .
About 100,000 mortgages are still underwater according to Central Bank data
Every generation has it hard , but those who were born in the 1970s and the early 1980s , the so-called “ negative equity generation ” , are faced with a particular set of challenges .
Burned very badly
“ They have been burned very badly on all sides ; their career has been stunted , their house growth has been stunted , ” says Eoin McGee , of Prosperous Financial Services in Kildare , summing up their experience as “ the great expectations they had , and the knock they took ” .
“ People were coming of age and starting to earn at a time when credit was thrown at them no problem , ” they recall . Typically , these people could then have started to see their earnings advance to cover their debts , but these stagnated , and in some cases actually fell .
“ They 'll never actually recover that three-four years where they 'd not wage growth , ” they say .
Financial adviser Nicholas Charalambous , of Alpha Wealth in Cork and , at 43 , a Gen Xer himself , says the main issue facing their generation is that they did n't put enough money away during the good times .
We were in a spend culture . . .when the bust came , it came at the worst possible time
“ They were ( in general ) in their 20s early 30s and we were in a spend culture , ” they recall . So , when the bust came , it came at the worst possible time , because it was the time when most of them should have been making serious provision for their retirement years .
But it 's not all “ gen-Xers ” who fall into this categorisation . Those born in the late 1960s , early 1970s , who are now aged between about 45-55 , and who would have been pushing 40 at the height of the boom , may have had a better experience . They would have likely bought a house in the late 1990s , when property prices though accelerating dramatically still had plenty to do to reach their peak and they therefore benefited greatly from subsequent price appreciation – even when prices collapsed after the crash .
For example , the average national house price was just €81,571 back in 1996 , or €90,951 in Dublin . These early Gen Xers also benefited from strong wage growth .
Buying a home . . . or two
Compared to today 's generation of first-time buyers , many more Gen Xers bought a property in their late twenties/early thirties . The 2006 Census , for example , shows that , after the age of 28 , owning a home was more common than renting ; the latest census shows that , now , most people rent up to the age of 35 .
However many bought family unfriendly apartments or in locations far away from friends and family in an ever-expanding “ commuter belt ” , and likely now wished they did n't .
When the bottom finally fell out of the property market , a generation of buyers found themselves unable to trade up even though prices were suddenly more affordable , because they were still mired in negative equity .
It also created a generation of accidental landlords , as people rented out their own property , and rented another property for their family . This has led to a marked shift in Irish society ; middle class areas in the capital are now awash with middle class renters , unable to offload their property bought during the boom , which is either too small or too far away from their chosen school , so they have opted to rent a property nearby instead .
Even now , almost 10 years on , they are still struggling to trade up .
Stuck in the middle
“ People are really just stuck in the middle and they ca n't go up and they ca n't go down , ” says McGee . “ There are lots of people in different pockets who ca n't move on in any way with their lives . ”
Yes , the negative equity issue has eased . About 100,000 mortgages are still underwater according to Central Bank data , but that is down from a peak of 318,000 in 2012 . Still , a significant number of people clearly continue to owe more than their property is worth .
Moreover , all the incentives to buy a property are typically directed at a younger generation .
Help-to-buy and Central Bank rules allowing people to borrow up to 90 per cent of a purchase price are restricted to first-time buyers . Those looking to trade up , on the other hand , have to come up with a deposit of 20 per cent of the purchase price under the Central Bank rules
And the situation is even worse for those who moved abroad as the downturn gripped , and are now looking to return home . They will need to put up a deposit of as much as 40 per cent of the purchase price . Their millennial counterparts on the other hand have to save just 5 per cent under Help-to-Buy when they buy a new home .
And as McGee notes , for second-time buyers , “ the bank of mam and dad has already been tapped ” .
Banks are starting to lend and listen
While Charalambous concedes that there is not a simple solution , they would encourage people to be active and “ not shy away from trying to help themselves ” .
“ Banks are starting to lend and listen , ” they say .
Also of concern is the fact that , like everyone , this generation is aging . This means the likelihood of owning a family home is also dwindling with time . With most banks refusing to lend to people aged 65 or over , a 45-year old may only be able to borrow over 20 years . And the shorter the term , the heftier the repayments . So with each passing year , so too does the term of a possible mortgage decline .
“ Unless their earnings dramatically increase , could they afford it on a 15-year mortgage ? ” asks McGee .
“ And the big , big ask is that the property wo n't dramatically fall again in 25 years time . That 's the fear , ” says McGee .
Austerity hits
At the same time as the bubble burst , Generation Xers found their income depleted by the impact of successive budgetary measures .
Consider a couple earning a combined income of €120,000 . Back in 2008 before the first austerity budget , they would have had €7,269 in after-tax income to spend every month . Now , almost 10 years later , they 're still bringing home less than they used to , at just €6,883 a month . And this is despite cuts in taxes such as USC in recent years . Coupled with this are additional expenses such as property tax .
And single income couples fare no better . Back in 2008 , a couple with one earner on €57,500 would have had €3,892 in take home pay ; today it 's just €3,720 , and that 's despite a number of increases in the stay at home parent 's tax credit .
Throw in a few pay cuts on top of this , and you can quickly see why people are struggling .
Figures from the Central Statistics Office show that while the average disposable income of their parents , the over-65s , has actually increased by 3 per cent to €31,016 between 2008 and 2015 , those in the 18-64 age group ( the CSO does not drill down any deeper ) saw their disposable incomes fall by 10 per cent over the same period , down to €49,021 in 2015 .
Hefty childcare costs
Couples where both partners work also became the norm in Generation X but rather than bring extra riches , it has just increased the stress – and the steep childcare burden – for many .
Childcare costs are a significant monthly drain on family finances
Couples living in Dublin can expect to pay as much as €1,200 for full-time care per child , while the after school burden can be €600 or more . Outside the capital the cost is less , but so too are wages in general .
Such a significant monthly expense drains not just the family finances , but also the chances of getting a decent mortgage .
Future prospects
In circumstances like this , as a recent survey from Aviva showed , Gen Xers are also less optimistic about their prospects , with two in three of those in the age group not expecting their income prospects to improve . Moreover , many of them have no firm financial plans for retirement .
Key to this perhaps is the shift in pension provision . Many of those coming into the workforce from the late 1990s onwards will either have been put into occupational defined contribution ( DC ) schemes , or will have had their defined benefit ( DB ) , or final salary , plan they initially enrolled in transferred into DC . Many others will have no private pension in place .
While DC plans , when well funded , can provide comfortable retirements , the problem is that too many are n't . A survey from Irish Life found that Irish DC plans are set to return a typical income of just 17 per cent of salary in retirement ; contrast this with as much as two thirds of final salary under a DB scheme .
A report has found both millennials and Generation X will never be able to match the pension provisions of the baby boomer generation
Earlier this month , a report from the UK based Institute and Faculty of Actuaries found that the demise of DB pension schemes means that both millennials and Generation X will never be able to match the pension provisions of the baby boomer generation .
But Charalambous says people should take heart from the fact that there is still time to improve their retirement plans .
“ Our advice would be that it is never too late to start , ” they say , adding that traditional pensions “ are only one part of the jigsaw on the retirement lifecycle ” . As accidental landlords , among others , may find , their “ accident ” turns good in the long run .
“ Whilst some are suffering negative equity , the improvement in property values and rents will ensure some of those will have an additional source of income in those retirement years , ” they say .
Another important point , which is often downplayed by pension advisers , is the State pension , which means that people will , at the very least , avoid destitution in retirement . While Charalambous notes that Generation X wo n't see the State pension until they 're 68 years of age , unlike older generations who got it at 65 , “ it still provides a very reasonable income of c€12,000 per year which is worth about €250,000 in monetary terms ” .

Dispatch from the Inevitable File out of Seattle : A man undressed in the women 's locker room of a local pool . Actually , they entered the locker room on numerous occasions , once while young girls were getting changed .
Under normal circumstances , the police would be called and the intrusive creep would be arrested . However , Washington state just passed a law requiring that all public facilities allow patrons to use the bathrooms and locker rooms matching their “ gender identity. ” Most media outlets are reporting — based only on assumption and nothing else — the guy was “ protesting ” the transgender bathroom policies . I 'm not sure if that was the case , but whatever their reasons , law enforcement and the facility 's managers had their hands tied .
Who 's to say they are n't “ transgender ” ? Who 's to say they did n't “ identify ” as a woman in that moment ? And whether they were “ transgender ” or not , considering “ transgender ” is a mental illness , what is the difference between a woman being forced to share a bathroom with a man who thinks he 's a man versus being forced to share it with a man who thinks he 's a woman ? Either way , it 's still a man . And this man has very conveniently demonstrated that fact .
Image source : KING-TV
As the sane members of society have been warning for a while now , when you allow men to invade the privacy of women , you end up in a situation where men invade the privacy of women . When you permit men to walk into the women 's bathroom , the result is — shockingly — men walking into the women 's bathroom . Washington is one of the first to enact one of these patently psychotic , utterly preposterous “ transgender ” bathroom laws statewide ( by the way , the law was n't passed through the state legislature , it was simply decreed by the bureaucratic Marxists on Washington 's Human Rights Commission ) . And it took only a few weeks for the progressive initiative to potentially endanger children . Imagine what it can achieve in a year !
.
Some may consider this incident hilarious , and although I 'm sympathetic to that perspective , and I do enjoy when liberal ideas are exposed as fantastically idiotic , I ca n't really laugh about it while women and small kids are involved . But funny or not , it has served to highlight two particular elements to the progressive war on gender . Keep in mind as we proceed that I am not making any of this up . The quotes I share are 100 percent authentic . All of this madness is actually occurring , I promise you , in the real world .
Now , here are two things we 've learned :
Progressives Erase Lines and Do n't Know Where to Redraw Them
Back in the old days , it was relatively easy to tell if a man was a man because if they were a man then they were a man . You could ask yourself , “ Gee , I wonder if that man is a man ? ” And you 'd realize you answered your own question . In similar fashion , you did n't know everything about a woman just by the fact that they were a woman , but you at least knew they were a woman , which meant they were a woman . If a man was a man , then they were a man ; and if a woman was a woman , then they were a woman . It made sense , I thought .
We had our lines drawn . A thing was what it was , and once you knew what it was , you could easily distinguish it from what it was n't . None of this was confusing until progressives got involved . Progressives have always been that boring stoner kid in your 10th-grade philosophy class who asks insufferably stupid questions that they think are profound . “ Yeah , man , but what if a thing , like , is n't what it is , or is what it is n't , you know ? ” Those kids always annoyed me . Little did I know I was entering a world run by them .
Now the lines have been erased , just as progressives erased them with marriage and just as they erased them in many other areas , including the womb . These days , you ca n't identify someone by who they are but by who they think they are or want to be .
No longer do we declare with confidence “ I am. ” Instead we say , “ I identify as. ” What we identify as has taken the place of what we are , and in the process , all form of identity — every line of delineation and distinction that defines us — has disintegrated .
Image source : KING-TV
But the problem with erasing a line is you 'll soon discover — usually the hard way — that it was there for a reason . GK Chesterton warned that a society should never take a wall down until it knows the reason it was put up . A progressive is someone who demolishes the wall just for the sake of it and then hurriedly tries to re-erect it somewhere down the road when the rabid dog it was fencing in starts to eat their face .
So , back to Seattle . Few money quotes from the local news report on the locker room incident . First , I really enjoyed this one from a woman who witnessed the man intruding in the women 's locker room :
“ Really bizarre , ” MaryAnne Sato said . ” I ca n't imagine why they would want to do that anyway ! ”
Ms. Sato “ ca n't imagine ” why a man would want to go into a place where women are taking off their clothes . “ Bizarre , ” they call it . Yes , it is quite the mystery . What could a man find appealing about naked women ? Hmm .
According to the article , David Takami , Seattle Parks spokesperson , says they 're working on preventing similar occurrences in the future :
Right now , there 's no specific protocol for how someone should demonstrate their gender in order to access a bathroom . Employees just rely on verbal identification or physical appearance , and this man offered neither .
Takami explains further :
“ This did n't seem like a transgender issue to staff — someone who was ‘ identifying ' as a woman , ” Takami wrote in a statement to KING 5 . “ We have guidelines that allow transgender individuals to use restrooms and locker rooms consistent with their gender identity . We want everyone to feel comfortable in our facilities . ”
Ms. Sato chimes in with this :
“ Either identify yourself as a transgender or you 're not and you 're just taking advantage of a loophole , ” MaryAnn Sato , who uses the locker room a few times a week , told KING-5 TV .
Again , if there were n't innocent women and kids endangered by this madness , you 'd have to laugh . A “ loophole ” ? No , ma'am , that fellow was not taking advantage of a loophole . The law is specifically designed to allow men in the women 's locker room . Yes , they may intend only for men who “ identify as women ” to enter , but whatever they “ identifies as , ” their actual identity has not changed . The law is made to protect the “ right ” of a penis-bearing individual to enter a room where vagina-bearing individuals are naked . That is literally the entire point of it . This man did not discover a bug ; they simply took advantage of a feature .
.
But what 's incredible , although not surprising , is that the very people intent on destroying gender norms are now in the position of having to construct new ones . Washington state must come up with “ protocols ” describing “ how a person should demonstrate their gender. ” The easiest identification protocol is the one we all subscribed to until progressives decided we must restructure our entire society to cater to the mentally ill : that is , you “ demonstrate your gender ” by simply being whatever gender you are . If that 's out of the question , we 're forced to devise rules for how a person must demonstrate the gender they want to be or think they are . Ironically , whatever system these fools devise , it will inevitably be more limiting than the original one .

They were convinced this man did n't “ indentify as ” a woman because they looked like a man and wore board shorts . So what ? Are we saying a man who “ identifies as a woman ” has to dress like one ? But what does it mean to dress like one ? I thought progressives just spent 40 damned years telling us there 's no such thing as “ dressing like a woman ” ? Now we 're going back to that in order to accommodate the desires of homosexual cross-dressers ? Not only must progressives rebuild the old wall , but they must rebuild other walls they already tore down decades ago . Suddenly , it turns out , women ca n't wear board shorts . Does that mean women ca n't have close cropped hair or a deep voice or hair on their legs ? I certainly feel that way , as a personal preference , but I thought feminists were fervently against any notion that women should be required to act , speak or look feminine ? Have we changed our minds on that ? Can someone write a memo or something just so I can understand where we are now ?
Progressivism is so intent on destruction that it even destroys its own “ progress. ” Amazing .
Progressives Do n't Care if Women and Kids Are Raped , So Long as Their Agenda Wins
As I 've said before , liberalism is an extremely hierarchical ideology , and homosexuals are at the very top . Their desires come first , and recently it seems the “ transgender ” subset of the homosexual community sits at the highest point of all . Of course , I 've always known that children , devout Christians and white men are at the bottom , our rights and wishes always trumped by the demands of literally any other group . But it will continue to fascinate me that “ transgenders ” — a population that consists of about 18 people — apparently supersede the entire pyramid .
That 's why this bill in South Dakota is being met with such absurd levels of hysteria . The law would require that men and women in the state use the bathroom correlating with their biological sex . It defines biological sex as “ the physical condition of being male or female as determined by a person 's chromosomes and anatomy as identified at birth. ” I never thought we 'd reach a point where states would have to pass laws clarifying the fact that men have penises , but here we are . Obviously , this bill is sensible and sadly necessary , but progressives are practically combusting over it .
One liberal blog says South Dakota is “ blazing a trail of bigotry ” by telling men to pee in the men 's bathroom . Another calls the law “ terrifying . ” Vox shrieked that the bill is “ anti-trans ” and based on a “ myth . ”

Meanwhile , this legislation that horrifies progressives would simply reaffirm what has always been the case virtually everywhere in America until three seconds ago . It would perhaps cause minor emotional discomfort to a handful of mentally ill people , but it would protect the privacy and safety and sanity of thousands more . But with “ transgenders ” now deemed the victimiest victim group of all , it 's simply not acceptable that any of them should experience even a moment 's inconvenience . The very thought of a gender-confused man having to go peepee and poopoo in the boy 's potty “ terrifies ” progressives . They are up at night panicked over the thought . The thought of women and children being made vulnerable and unsafe , however ? Not nearly as troubling .
One liberal website , reporting on the Seattle incident , explained the hierarchy this way :
Cisgender women might just have to deal with cis men creeps attempting to invade spaces that have traditionally been designated as “ safe ” for women .
Incredible . Women and children “ might have to deal ” with potentially being raped or assaulted ? Good God , these people are truly insane . And these are the very same whackos constantly screaming about the rape epidemic and the rape culture . But now , for the sake of the practically non-existent “ transgender ” demographic , women “ have to deal ” with being unsafe . They “ have to deal ” with “ creeps ” invading their space .
.
Yes , we are certainly in a situation where some group — either “ transgenders ” or women and children — will simply have to deal . Either gay men who want to be women will have to deal with using the men 's room , or all women and girls will have to deal with the potential of grown men walking into the room where they 're changing and using the toilet . Astonishingly , the gender-confused men win . Their very deranged desires beat the very reasonable desires of women and young girls . Their fantasies take precedence over the safety and security of women and children . Mothers and daughters will “ have to deal ” with being raped and assaulted so that gender-confused men do n't have to deal with biological realities .
A doctor could spend a lifetime evaluating the collective psychosis of progressivism that 's led to this point , but one thing we can now confirm beyond a shadow of a doubt — not that there was any doubt before — is that progressives simply do n't care about women and kids . Their agenda is all that matters . Everyone else will have to deal with the consequences .
God save us from these fanatics .

Image copyright AFP Image caption Police say the man began shooting at them as soon as they appeared at their property early on Wednesday
A 49-year-old man has been arrested after wounding four police officers in the southern state of Bavaria , German police say .
The man opened fire after being asked to hand over their weapons , for which their permit had been revoked .
One of the officers is said to have received life-threatening injuries in the incident in the town of Georgensgmuend , south of Nuremberg .
The man is said to belong to the far-right Reichsbuerger movement .
They had previously refused on several occasions to co-operate with municipal officials concerned about their ownership of 31 weapons , officials told a news conference .
They requested the assistance of the police , who mounted an early-morning raid on the man 's property .
But they immediately began shooting at officers without opening the door . Two police officers suffered gunshot wounds and the other two had unspecified injuries , said Germany 's DPA news agency .
The gunman was lightly injured in the exchange .
Reichsbuerger movement
The Reichsbuerger ( `` Reich Citizens '' ) group does not recognise the authority of the post-war German federal republic , seeing it merely as some sort of private company . It believes in the continued existence of a German empire , or Reich , dating back to 1937 or even earlier .
Image copyright AFP Image caption Police moved in because the suspect had repeatedly refused to co-operate with local officials
Its roots are said to go back some three decades .
Bavarian officials said the group 's ideology was `` nationalist and anti-Semitic .... clearly extreme right '' . Their circle had grown in recently years , they said , and included `` whingers , nutcases , conspiracy theorists , but also the far-right '' .
The diversity of beliefs and views within the group militates against a simple hierarchical structure or clear leadership .
But the group should not be dismissed simply as an `` association of crackpots '' , said Bavarian Interior Minister Joachim Herrmann . Some of its members were obviously capable of brutal violence , particularly targeting representatives of the German state , they warned . Others use their rejection in the authority of the German state as grounds to refuse to pay taxes or creditors .
Shad will become the new host of CBC 's cultural affairs radio show Q , which will retain its name as it relaunches in mid-April .
The 32-year-old is a multiple Juno-nominated artist who has drawn praise in Canada and the U.S. for their humour , passion and originality , winning in 2011 for Rap Recording of the Year .
Born in Kenya to Rwandan parents , Shadrach Kabango was raised in London , Ont. , going on to earn a business degree from Wilfrid Laurier University and a master 's degree in liberal studies from Simon Fraser University .
Their first full-length release came in 2005 with When This Is Over , and they broke out in a major way on the follow-up The Old Prince , which was nominated for a Polaris Prize . Their most recent release was 2014 's Flying Colours .
`` Joining the Q team is an honour , '' Shad said late Tuesday . `` My mission in music has always been to make a unique and positive contribution to culture and to people 's lives . This is an exciting opportunity to pursue that same mission in a new way , alongside a brilliant , passionate team . ''
Cindy Witten , interim executive director of CBC Radio and Audio , said that management conducted an exhaustive search for a new host , looking at more than 200 people .
'An original thinker '
`` We were looking for someone who is an original thinker , curious and emotionally intelligent , '' said Witten . `` Also , a good conversationalist who is witty and fast on their feet . We wanted someone steeped in arts and culture in this country .
Juno Award-winning MC Shad has been named the new host of CBC cultural affairs program Q on CBC Radio . ( CBC )
`` We found there were different points of connection with the guests when the host was a creator or an artist themselves . ''
The show has been searching for a permanent replacement host since the CBC fired its original host Jian Ghomeshi . They were dismissed after managers said they viewed `` graphic evidence '' that Ghomeshi had physically injured a woman . The former host is currently facing sexual assault charges .
`` It was a difficult time last fall and it is behind us . We 're excited to introduce Canadians to their new host and a fresh and lively Q , '' Witten said .
Despite the shadow the Ghomeshi scandal cast on the show , Shad says it did n't really cross their mind when deciding whether to take the post .
Hosting Q `` was so compatible with my mission in music , '' Shad told CBC News Network 's Heather Hiscox on Wednesday .
`` At the same time , it 's certainly a situation to step into , and my thoughts are mainly with the team and how they 're doing coming off of that . ''
Show to keep its name
Although there had been questions as to whether the show 's name would change , Witten said CBC focus groups revealed that a large majority of listeners wanted the name of the show to remain the same .
The new show will have more musical performances and will be less structured , with a more conversational tone to allow more live spontaneous moments .
Shad 's first morning behind the mic as the official host of Q takes place on April 20 .
As a guest host , the musician and broadcaster flagged Kanye West or U.S. President Barack Obama as potential `` dream guests . '' But when asked who he 'd like to interview in their inaugural episode , the modest MC deferred to the show 's team .
`` There are so many voices out there , '' Shad said . `` Fortunately Q is at a level where they can bring those people in . ''
`` Whoever has the most insightful , poignant , compelling insights into the human condition and the conditions we live in ... That 's who I want to have at the desk . ''
Q is heard twice daily ( 10 a.m. and 10 p.m. ) on CBC Radio One , and on more than 170 public radio stations across the United States . For more information about the show , or to listen to past episodes , see the official Q website .

The UK government has set a world-leading climate change target up to the early 2030s .
The Fifth Carbon Budget will cut carbon emissions by 57 % by 2032 - that 's based on 1990 levels .
The announcement will help reassure investors needed to overhaul the UK 's ageing energy system .
But the government 's advisory Committee on Climate Change ( CCC ) has warned the targets will be missed unless policies are improved .
Labour 's Barry Gardiner urged tougher policies , although they said : `` At a time of great division and instability , I welcome the decision to set the Fifth Carbon Budget .
`` I recognise the difficulties that the Energy Secretary ( Amber Rudd ) has faced from many of their colleagues in securing this agreement , particularly in the aftermath of the vote to leave the EU . ''
Environmentalists and the energy industry are also relieved that the Fifth Carbon Budget will be adopted , even though they say the targets need to be more demanding to meet the ambitions of the global Paris climate change accord to hold global temperature rise as close as possible to 1.5C .
There have been doubts about government commitment on climate change after huge cuts in renewables subsidies followed by the vote to leave the EU , which influences so much of the UK 's energy .
But Ms Rudd said climate change remained one of the most serious long-term risks to the economy . Speaking at the Business & Climate Summit in London , they said : `` Climate change has not been downgraded as a threat .
`` We must not turn our back on Europe or the world … So while I think the UK 's role in dealing with a warming planet may have been made harder by the decision last Thursday , our commitment to dealing with it has not gone away . ''
Innovation essential
Business spokespersons at the conference echoed a call by the former Labour Climate Secretary Ed Miliband for the Prime Minister to ratify the Paris climate accord immediately .
The CCC 's latest report today calculates that the UK 's emissions cuts are in line so far with the goal of the Climate Change Act of cutting CO2 80 % by 2050 .
But it says a new approach is needed to ensure emissions keep falling . It mentions housing as well as agriculture and transport - two sectors where emissions are already growing .
There has , for instance , been a rise in purchases of larger cars since the Chancellor changed VED rules so a driver pays as much VED for a Prius as a Porsche .
The committee also says ministers must support carbon capture and storage technology , which will allow fossil fuels to continue to be burned . The Prime Minister said this innovation was essential for the UK - before they withdrew the funds supporting it .
Professor Dave Reay from the University of Edinburgh , said of the CCC report : `` This wake-up call for climate policy will inevitably be drowned out by Brexit furore this week . That 's a crying shame as the message here is clear : we must do better . From agriculture to transport , from energy efficiency to carbon capture , UK action on climate change is faltering . ''
But Marylyn Haines-Evans from the National Federation of Women 's Institutes said the confirmation of the Carbon Budget was good news : `` This is important both for future generations , and also for the British wildlife and countryside that our members care so much about . ''
The climate sceptic group Global Warming Policy Forum ( GWPF ) complained the decision should have been left to the next government . A statement said : `` The government has behaved unreasonably , and should have delayed approval of the Budget and reassessed the impacts in the light of the far-reaching changes flowing from the referendum result . ''
Simon Bullock from Friends of the Earth said : `` After the huge confusion following the Brexit vote , we welcome the certainty this decision gives . Investors will now know that the UK is a place where low carbon investment can flourish . The big challenge is to ensure stronger policies to meet this carbon budget . ''
Environment groups were celebrating the further delay on a Heathrow runway decision following Brexit uncertainty . They are also hoping that the Brexit vote provokes French unions into rejecting Hinkley nuclear station .
Labour says the government left it so late to notify Parliament about the Carbon Budget that it is technically in breach of the Climate Change Act .
This mandates that carbon budgets must be passed by both houses of Parliament by the end of June , which is now impossible . Ministers insist , though , that the Budget will become law .

EMILY MCDERMOTT : Can you tell me about “ Bonhomie ” ?
ST. CHARLES : The band writes the bulk of the instrumentation together , and when the song starts coming together that 's when we decide who 's going to write vocals and lyrics . So the song sounded almost like it does now and to me it 's like , “ This is a pop song , in a way we do n't always do , ” so my inspiration was trying to make it interesting . I liked the thought of a song that 's banal and crass , in a way that 's often off-putting in a relationship song . This is like a bratty love song , but since there are two perspectives it 's not overbearing . They 're both a little immature , juvenile . There 's something that 's endearing when you see both sides of a relationship and both people are acting a little immature .
MCDERMOTT : You said writing this album was diplomatic , but everyone has struggles . What is one that you faced when writing the music together ?
ST. CHARLES : It 's often frustrating to try to flesh out what comes next when it 's four people in a room playing music . Brennan and I have known each other since we were four years old and we 've been playing together since we were in middle school . We 've only ever played with each other and we have a lot of chemistry . We 're pretty good at sitting down—he 'll play something and I 'll play something—for hours . A lot of times it 's not good but it 's fun . It 's frustrating when we 're doing something like that and Britty 's like , “ You have to slow down so I can fit in here somehow. ” Understanding that that process is always helpful , learning when collaboration is good , and learning when taking a step back and working individually is good . That 's the biggest thing that we struggle with when we 're writing .
MCDERMOTT : Aside from writing more collaboratively , how else do you think you have grown as a band since Feasts of Love ?
ST. CHARLES : I think it 's a matter of approaching the music with more confidence . We 've all retained a level-headedness when it comes to how we approach music , because we all went to college and heave career paths in mind . Playing music has always been something we 've done because we like it , not something we do because we 're desperate for a career in it . Over time it becomes second nature , and I think that 's reflected in the songs . They 're more dynamic because it comes together more naturally . That 's true for writing and definitely true for recording . We were so familiar with how to record with Will Yip , who produces our records , that we did n't have to think about it . We just think about how the songs work .
MCDERMOTT : Having mentioned college and the career path , I read an interview with Britty where they talked about their degree from the University of Michigan . Where did you go and what did you study ?
SALT LAKE CITY — The LDS Church plans to translate scriptures into 34 additional languages , with a new translation release process allowing church members to have access to the translations in their own languages quicker .
In a Oct. 9 letter , the First Presidency of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints announced “ a new process will allow individuals to study draft portions of translations prior to publication of final translations , which means members will have earlier access to the scriptures in their language . ”
“ As translations proceed , completed portions can be released in sequence from time to time , ” the letter states . “ These sequential portions , although not considered final until the full translation is completed , will be made available on LDS.org and in the Gospel Library mobile application . ”
The online release for a few languages will begin on Nov. 30 , and printed editions will follow . The complete translation process typically takes several years , “ as scripture texts are carefully translated , ” according LDS.org .
“ The initial release of approved draft translations will include content that has been translated and reviewed by local leaders , ” LDS.org explains . “ Additional portions of translations will continue to be released periodically . Translations that are currently nearing completion will not have drafts published . ”
While members and leaders may have access to draft translations of prayers for ordinances such as sacrament prayers and the baptismal prayer , the First Presidency requests that they continue to use the translations they have had until the new translations are complete .
The new scripture translation projects that have been approved are as follows :
• The Book of Mormon will be translated in Burmese , Efik , Georgian , Navajo , Pohnpeian , Sesotho and Tshiluba .
• The triple combination of the Book of Mormon , Doctrine and Covenants and Pearl of Great Price will be translated in American Sign Language , Afrikaans , Amharic , Arabic , Bislama , Greek , Hiligaynon , Hindi , Hmong , Lao , Lingala , Malay , Persian , Polish , Serbian , Setswana , Sinhala , Slovak , Slovenian , Tahitian , Tamil , Telugu , Tok Pisin , Turkish , Twi , Urdu and Yoruba .
Of course , if Spotify simply painted everything black that would n't be big news . The redesign touches on almost every element of the experience . The edges are softer , there 's a heavy use of blurring on background images ( especially in the mobile app ) and there 's a new typeface , Proxima Nova , that 's clean and heavily rounded . Despite the starkness of the UI elements , these touches make the app feel warm and inviting . The new look also borrows flourishes from social networks . Artist and user pages now feature a round profile image against a large cover photo and content is now presented as image-heavy cards when browsing . Those round profile photos also give you a quick visual cue to let you know a card is for a person or artist , rather than a song or album . In general you 'll notice a lot more images throughout the interface , and big ones at that .
The overall look is not that unlike a dark cousin of Google+ , at least in the browser . The desktop client uses many visual elements as the redesigned web player , but still retains some of the more traditional media manager elements . The mobile app employs a heavy does of transparency and slides around individual UI elements to keep them out of the way and maximize screen real estate . It also makes the shift to a tabbed interface that more inline with modern design trends .
The changes are not purely cosmetic either . The company has finally fully implemented search as you type across all platforms , and it 's blazingly fast . This will also be the first time that many users will get to enjoy collections -- a feature that has been rolling out painfully slowly . Rather than being forced to save albums as playlists , users will simply be able to add them to their library for quick and easy access .

The Stanford men 's and women 's tennis teams are brushing the dust off of the offseason this weekend as they prepare to compete in the Intercollegiate Tennis Association 's Northwest Regional Championships . The men 's team will travel to the University of the Pacific in Stockton , while the women 's team will play host to the tournament and compete in the Taube Family Tennis Center .
This is the second tournament of the season for both teams , as both lineups competed in the Intercollegiate Tennis Association 's All-American Championships from Oct. 2-9 . Both teams exited the tournament with mixed results .
The men 's team found success in the doubles bracket , as the team of juniors Sameer Kumar and Michael Genender defeated two top-25 ranked pairs in a row after dropping their first match . They reached the semifinals of the consolation bracket before splitting sets with No . 29 Louisville and dropping a super tiebreaker 10-5 .
The men 's team struggled in the singles portion of the tournament , with no players competing in the main draw , and only Sameer Kumar taking a single game in the qualifying bracket . The women 's team saw considerably more success in singles , but had no entries into the doubles brackets .
All-American junior Melissa Lord , ranked No . 7 in the country , lost their first singles match of the main draw tournament to No . 14 Gabby Smith from USC but rallied in the consolation bracket . They took down No . 10 Elena Christofi from UGA and No . 34 Rosie Johanson from UVA to reach the semifinals , where they fell in two sets to No . 35 Anastasia Rychagova from Kansas .
This weekend 's tournaments should provide insight into the Cardinal 's season prospects . Both teams are looking to follow up on strong seasons , and hopefully claim a national championship this spring . The Cardinal have strong returning members , including a top 10 player in both the men and women 's rankings . Lord is No . 7 among all women , and senior Tom Fawcett checks in at No . 8 among the men .
The most exciting thing to watch this weekend will be seeing if the highly touted first-year student prospects will play for either team , and how they perform . The Intercollegiate Tennis Association 's freshmen rankings place first-year student Axel Geller at No . 1 in the country for the men , and first-year student Michaela Gordon is No . 2 for women .
Both Cardinal tennis teams begin their tournament play on Thursday .

Buzzardroost Rock Trail offers a truly stunning vista perched 500 feet above the Ohio Brush Creek valley . The trail is part of the 16,000-acre Edge of Appalachia Preserve in Adams County . Located just south of Ohio SR-125 , the trail stretches 2.2 miles one-way along ridgelines from the parking lot to the observation area , making for a 4.4-mile hike .
A sign at a gravel turn-off on the south side of SR-125 identifies the parking area and trail-head for Buzzardroost Trail . About a quarter mile down the gravel road is a cement parking area and an information kiosk about the trail . The trailhead is near a large sign across the gravel driveway from the parking area .
The trail traverses a small hill , crosses a small bridge , and enters the woods . A sign-in kiosk for visitors is located at the bridge . The trail is marked with red blazes . It proceeds through forest for about a mile crossing bridges over several small streams which feature small seasonal waterfalls .
It then emerges into an open prairie area for a short while , ascends a hill and re-enters the forest . After another mile , it emerges on top of a Peebles dolomite rock outcropping overlooking Ohio Brush Creek . An observation area features benches and a spectacular view .
We arrived about lunch time on a clear sunny day . We stayed a while and ate our trail lunch while enjoying the view . We visited in late May , but we 've been told that the vista from the observation area is superb for viewing fall color .
There is a sign at the observation deck which shows the location of the observation deck relative to its surroundings . It also makes clear that this would be a wonderful place to view fall color .
Because we were there in the May , a number of spring wildflowers were blooming , some of which we already published in the post , Spring Wildflowers 2015 . Some additional wildflowers follow .
We also saw a number of butterflies and moths .
We do n't normally post photos of flies , but this one was shiney . 🙂
Deb was also excited to see the following toad because almost every single toad we see is an Eastern American Toad ( Bufo americanus americanus ) . The one below is a Fowler 's toad . One way to tell the species apart is to count the number of warts in various dark spots . If you find dark spots with more than two warts , it 's a Fowler 's toad ; otherwise , it 's an Eastern American toad .

UCLA has offered admission to 16,177 high school seniors with outstanding academic records and impressive achievements outside the classroom , from a humanitarian who started a nonprofit that promotes literacy in Africa to an international award-winning photojournalist and a nationally ranked figure skater and U.S. patent holder .
Among this year 's class are 9,539 California residents , 84 percent of whom will graduate in the top 9 percent of their high school class , and high-achieving students from nearly every other state and 74 countries .
Despite the stiff competition for admission this year , UCLA continued to honor its longstanding commitment to socioeconomic diversity , with nearly 31 percent of admitted California residents reporting they will be the first in their family to graduate from a four-year college and 31 percent coming from low-income families .
In an effort to maintain the University of California 's commitment to state residents , UCLA increased its in-state enrollment target for this fall to 4,100 students , up 100 from last year . The enrollment target for non-residents will remain at approximately 1,600 students .
Overall , UCLA admitted roughly 20 percent of the 80,497 applicants for the fall 2013 first-year student class . Collectively , these students make up UCLA 's most diverse class to date in terms of their geographic , racial , ethnic and socioeconomic backgrounds .
`` The ever-increasing demand for a UCLA education and the competitiveness of our admissions process are testaments to our value as one of the world 's most prestigious universities and the destination point for exceptionally talented and motivated students , '' said UCLA Chancellor Gene Block . `` Our admitted class represents the wide range of backgrounds that a public institution like UCLA should reflect . ''
Among admitted California residents , 43.0 percent are Asian American , 26.3 percent are white , 21.3 percent are Chicano/Latino and 4.2 percent are African American .
Last Saturday , April 13 , Chancellor Block and other campus leaders welcomed nearly 15,000 admitted first-year students and family members to Bruin Day on campus , where they sampled everything that makes UCLA a world-renowned university , from its top academic programs to its unmatched facilities and vibrant campus life .
`` I want to thank the students , alumni , faculty and staff who , with their characteristic enthusiasm and optimism , encouraged our newly admitted students to join the Bruin family on Bruin Day , '' said Youlonda Copeland-Morgan , UCLA 's associate vice chancellor for enrollment management . `` We are all deeply committed to enrolling a student body of extraordinary students from California , the nation and world who will enrich our campus with their backgrounds , talents , interests and experiences . ''
In addition to California residents , UCLA offered fall 2013 admission to 6,638 out-of-state and international students , a slight increase over last year . By university policy , the academic qualifications of non-resident students must compare favorably to California residents admitted to the campus .
`` One ca n't underestimate the importance of the cultural and linguistic diversity , as well as the fresh ideas and perspectives , that international and out-of-state students bring to campus , '' Copeland-Morgan said . `` UCLA 's prestige as a global university is enhanced by their contributions . ''
In addition to its first-year student class , UCLA will be offering admission to stellar transfer students for the fall 2013 term on April 26 . Transfer students are not only critical to UCLA 's mission as a public university , but they add vibrancy and diversity to campus life , Copeland-Morgan said .
Admitted first-year student must submit their Statement of Intent to Register by May 1 ; transfer students have until June 1 to accept their admission offer .
In total , the University of California offered admission to 82,850 first-year student applicants for the fall 2013 term at the system 's nine undergraduate campuses .
Statistics for all nine UC undergraduate campuses are available at http : //www.ucop.edu/news/studstaff.html

Half a century of fighting over every speck of Alberta 's oil sands now behind them , Canada 's largest heavy-oil producers are now embroiled in another decades-long battle .
[ /np_storybar ]
The challenges facing Canada 's energy industry — to turn one of the most energy-and emissions-intensive resource extraction processes in the world into something more environmentally sustainable — dwarf the innovation hurdles facing other industries . To overcome them , an interconnected army of innovators is key .
“ People always ask me why this is so hard , ” said Robert Donahue , a consulting research engineer at the Syncrude Ltd. research-and-development ( R & D ) centre focusing on the restoration of depleted mine sites to their natural state , and a former University of Alberta geotechnical engineering professor . “ I tell them I 'm trying to reconstruct the earth and I 'm trying to do it without geological time on my side . I need to do it in human time . ”
Mr. Donahue is part of a growing collective of PhD-toting , private industry-sponsored academics who have been taking research and development in the energy sector to higher and more commercially viable areas .
In traditionally R & D-intensive industries like technology or pharmaceuticals , academic support often comes from the odd breakthrough in a lab or from networks of scientists working in silos that are disconnected from the industries for which their research is intended . Such dynamics explain why academia is so often criticized for spending immense time and resources developing projects that never find a commercial application .
In the energy sector , however , the commercialization gap is often mitigated by a much closer integration of academia and private industry .
“ Traditionally , universities have pushed their knowledge out to society , but what we 're trying to do is pay much more attention to the needs from society , ” explained Ed McCauley , vice-president of research at the University of Calgary ( U of C ) . “ My job is to try and match the considerable strength we have on campus with those societal opportunities . ”
[ np-related ]
Those strengths , when brought to bear on a specific problem or issue , truly are considerable . As a mid-sized Canadian university , the U of C brings in approximately $ 285-million each year in external research funds , ranking it seventh in the country .
Compared against Canadian corporate R & D spending figures from industry monitor Research Infosource Inc. , the figure would place U of C among the nation 's top 10 R & D spenders . Yet beyond the cash , what the university and similar research-focused institutions across the country provide to Canada 's energy industry is the ability to leverage top outside minds to focus on solving some of its most daunting challenges .
In return , energy companies provide ongoing support and incentives for Canadians to further their scientific and technical education at a time when the national economy is suffering from an increasing lack of workers with those skills .
Case in point is Syncrude , the consortium of the largest oil sands players behind one of the region 's most significant mining operations . The company gives $ 6-million each year to support research at the University of Alberta alone — a sum equivalent to 10 % of Syncrude 's annual internal research budget .
Syncrude supports 10 research chairs at various institutions across the country , each providing unique and focused support to a Syncrude project . Any given semester , the company is also supporting between 25 and 30 graduate students .
Richard Paproski was one of them . In 2000 , the Edmonton native completed an internship at the Syncrude R & D facility in their home town while still an undergraduate chemistry student at the University of Alberta . Eventually , they became one of about two dozen graduate students who annually receive direct funding from the company . Today , with their chemistry doctorate in hand , Mr. Paproski works full time at the R & D centre as a research chemist .
“ I was actually able to use some of the equipment and instruments here as well toward my research , so it was really beneficial to have the funding but also to access the facilities at the same time , ” they explained while hosting a tour of their workplace .
They still work with universities , and unlike the impact of R & D spending at a technology or pharmaceutical company , all of the incremental , collective progress they make directly impacts the bottom line .
“ Just a 1 % improvement in extraction recovery is worth about $ 60-million a year to Syncrude so even the smallest improvements are worth going after , ” Mr. Paproski said .
That is where outside help from the U of C and other institutions is critical . While Syncrude researchers focus on the most pressing issues , the U of C has hundreds of minds dedicated to improving nearly every other facet of the business .
“ We have on campus more than 120 faculty members doing research that is directly related to energy and we support more than 500 graduate students also working on projects related to energy , ” Mr. McCauley said , noting many of them are connected directly with industry goals .
“ We want to work with industrial consortia where a group of companies identifies a big problem they ca n't solve and ask how they can partner with the University to go after solving that big problem . ”
One project involves analyzing how very small earthquakes can occur inside oil and gas reservoirs . The study , which is supported by a consortium of 10 major energy companies and a partnership with the University of Alberta , will help settle the ongoing and increasingly expensive debate over whether the controversial drilling practice called hydraulic fracturing or “ fracking ” leads to earthquakes .
Another takes a longer-term view , exploring the role biology can play in bettering the extraction and upgrading process .
Because victory for this innovation army is still a generation away at best , the industry 's investment in Canadian education often starts below the postsecondary level . Last year , for example , Syncrude gave $ 1-million to establish a science and technology lab at a Fort McMurray , Alta . high school .
“ We have a long-term need for more people to have an interest in science and technology , ” said company spokesperson Cheryl Robb . “ That is why we are going all the way to the high school level now . ”

Final Fantasy XV recently made headlines around the world after a new game trailer was revealed and the highly-anticipated game was only scheduled for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One . However , in a recent job listing , Square Enix was seen looking for an “ Online Game Planner ” for “ new online games related to FFXV ” , with the candidate having “ interest , curiosity , and/or experience with PC games ” .
While it is certainly not confirmed that Final Fantasy XV is being ported to the PC platform , it seems there will be a side game , an online one , related to the core storyline . Moving to PC online games is not really a surprise , as Square Enix has found huge success with Final Fantasy XIV , and also launching a PC MOBA and an online PvP shooter . Definitely exciting times for PC gamers .

DOHA , Qatar — Matthew and Grace Huang , an American couple accused of killing their 8-year-old adopted African daughter last year by depriving them of sustenance for four days , were unexpectedly found guilty on Thursday and were each sentenced to three years in prison followed by deportation , in a case that has drawn close attention in Qatar and in the United States .
The State Department expressed disappointment at the verdict , which the defendants and their supporters described as a grievous error that would be appealed .
The Huangs were allowed to leave the courtroom after the verdict and remained free on their own recognizance , as they have been for the past four months after nearly a year of incarceration in Qatar , where Mr. Huang had been working as a public works infrastructure engineer . Their legal representatives said that the appeal process would most likely begin in May and that they would seek permission to fly home even while the appeal is pending .
“ We have just been wrongfully convicted , and we feel as if we are being kidnapped by the Qatar judicial system , ” Mr. Huang , 37 , said in a statement that they read to reporters outside the courtroom with their wife , 36 , standing beside him . “ This verdict is wrong and appears to be nothing more than an effort to save face . ”
Official party status refers to the Canadian practice of recognizing political parties in the Parliament of Canada and the provincial legislatures . In official documents , this is sometimes referred to as being a recognized party ( French : parti reconnu ) . The type of recognition and threshold needed to obtain it varies . However , the most coveted privileges are funding for party research offices and the right to ask questions during Question Period .
Recognition in Parliament allows parties certain parliamentary privileges . Generally official party status depends on winning a minimum number of seats ( that is , the number of Members of Parliament or Members of the Legislative Assembly elected ) .
Federally , the idea of recognizing parties for official status started in 1963 . [ 1 ] Prior to this , the only opposition recognition was that of the Leader of the Opposition , effectively limiting `` official status '' to the Government and the largest Opposition party . It was not until 1970 that the Elections Act was amended to allow parties to register and thus have their party name on the ballot .
Most of the rules governing official party status are not laws , but are internal rules governing the legislatures . Therefore , the members of a legislature may , if they choose , pass a motion to dispense with the rules and grant official status to parties that would otherwise fail to qualify . There are many examples of this practice .
Special cases [ edit ]
House of Commons [ edit ]
Since 1985 , [ 6 ] a party must have at least 12 seats to be recognized as an official party [ 7 ] in the House of Commons . Recognition means that the party will get time to ask questions during question period , and money for research and staff ( both are proportional to the number of seats . )
Senate [ edit ]
In the Senate , a party must have five seats and must be registered by Elections Canada . Once the party has been recognized in the Senate , it retains its status even if it becomes deregistered , so long as it keeps at least five seats . This rule means that the rump Progressive Conservative Party caucus in the Senate qualified for official status after the rest of that party merged into the Conservative Party of Canada .
In 2016 , Senators without any party affiliation formed the Independent Senators Group , which has been granted some privileges like those of a party .
Alberta [ edit ]
In the general elections of 1997 , 2001 , and 2008 , the Alberta New Democratic Party ( NDP ) failed to win the requisite four seats to gain official party status in the Legislative Assembly of Alberta . Nevertheless , the governing Progressive Conservatives ( PCs ) granted party status to the NDP after each election .
British Columbia [ edit ]
After the 2001 general election , new B.C . Premier Gordon Campbell , leader of the British Columbia Liberal Party , was criticized for their decision not to grant the NDP official party status . It was the only opposition party in the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia but it had won only two of 79 seats in the last election .
Since the 2013 election , the British Columbian Green Party has held their first seat as their then-member Andrew Weaver was elected in Oak Bay-Gordon Head district . After the 2017 election , they gained two more seats thus overall had three seats when the minimum for official party status was four . However , after the party entered a confidence and supply agreement with the New Democratic Party to allow the NDP to form government , it was granted official party status with reduced funding . [ 8 ]
New Brunswick [ edit ]
In New Brunswick , parties require 5 seats or 20 % of the popular vote to get official party status . However , parties with one to four seats have been allowed time in Question Period with consent of other parties . The Liberals won all 58 seats in the New Brunswick Legislative Assembly in 1987 . The government allowed the Progressive Conservative Party , which finished second place in the election in the number of votes received , to submit written questions to ministers during Question Period .
Ontario [ edit ]
Following the Ontario general election , 1999 , the Ontario New Democratic Party fell to nine seats in the Ontario Legislative Assembly . The rules at the time of the election called for parties to hold 12 seats to maintain party status . PC Premier Mike Harris , citing the reduction in seats from 130 to 103 ( -20.76 % ) , subsequently lowered the required number of seats for official party status from 12 to 8 ( 33 1/3 % ) . The mathematically corresponding cut would therefore have been from 12 seats to 9 seats ( 25 % , slightly higher than the seat reduction ) or 10 seats ( 16 2/3 % , slightly lower ) .
In the 2003 election , the New Democrats won only seven seats in the Ontario Legislative Assembly . The new Liberal government refused to accord official party status to the NDP , with Premier Dalton McGuinty instead offering the NDP additional funding in return for accepting their status as independents ; NDP leader Howard Hampton refused and disrupted the throne speech in protest . [ 9 ] MPP Marilyn Churley threatened to change their surname legally to `` Churley-NDP '' so that the Speaker would be forced to say NDP when recognizing them in the House ( a non-official party loses the right to have its members addressed in the Legislature by party affiliation ) . The PCs ' Bill Murdoch also considered joining the NDP caucus to help them make official status . [ 10 ] Andrea Horwath 's by-election win in May 2004 regained official party status for the NDP . [ 11 ]
After Churley resigned to run in the 2006 federal election , bringing the party to only seven members again , the government decided to allow the NDP to retain official status pending the results of the by-election to replace her , which the NDP won .
In the 2018 Ontario general election , the Liberals dropped from a majority government of 55 seats to 7 seats , one seat fewer than official party status . The Green Party of Ontario also elected its first member in the 2018 election and similarly lacks official party status .
Quebec [ edit ]
In 1989 , the Equality Party won four seats in the National Assembly of Quebec ( eight seats short of the total needed for official status ) . Although it did not receive official party status , its members were granted some of the privileges of an official party : their seats in the Assembly were placed together , as were their offices in the Parliament Building . They were also granted a limited number of opportunities to ask questions during Question Period . The party had no success in subsequent elections , and stopped organizing after the 2003 Quebec election . This precedent was followed when Action démocratique du Québec elected four members in 2003 and seven members in 2008 . However , when the seven former ADQ members joined with two former Parti Québécois members in January 2012 to form Coalition Avenir Québec , the governing Liberals and opposition Parti Québécois refused to grant any status to the new party , requiring all nine members to sit as independents .
In the 2018 Quebec general election , the Official Opposition party Parti Québécois ( PQ ) fell from 28 to 10 seats , thus falling below the threshold of official party status . [ 12 ] [ 13 ] Québec solidaire ( QS ) rose from 3 to 10 seats but did not reach the threshold of 12 to gain official party status . However , before the National Assembly convened , all political parties agreed to give the PQ and QS the status of official parties in the assembly . [ 14 ] [ 15 ]
Registered party [ edit ]
Official party status is not to be confused with being a registered party . A political party ( even if it has no parliamentary seats ) may register with Elections Canada or a provincial chief electoral officer . Doing so allows the political party to run candidates for office during elections , issue tax receipts for donations , and spend money on advertising and campaigning during election campaigns . In return , the party must obey campaign spending and donation limits , disclose the source of large donations , and obey various election laws .

An extensive field investigation into the origins of Isis ' weaponry in Syria and Iraq has found that weapons supplied by the US and Saudi Arabia to the Syrian opposition often ended up in the jihadis ' hands , enhancing the “ quantity and quality ” of their armaments .
While most weapons in Isis ' arsenal were captured from the Syrian and Iraqi armies , Conflict Armament Research ( CAR ) 's report , published on Thursday , found that the number of US and Saudi supplied weapons in Isis ' arsenal goes “ far beyond those that would have been available through battle capture alone ” .
“ Iraq and Syria have seen Isis forces use large numbers of weapons , supplied by states such as Saudi Arabia and the United States , against the various international anti-Isis coalitions that the two states support , ” researchers found .

The US and Saudi supplied weapons were all manufactured in EU countries , and Washington and Riyadh had broken contractual clauses prohibiting their transfer , CAR said .
“ Evidence collected by CAR indicates that the United States has repeatedly diverted EU-manufactured weapons and ammunition to opposition forces in the Syrian conflict . Isis forces rapidly gained custody of significant quantities of this material , ” it said .
“ [ The findings are ] a stark reminder of the contradictions inherent in supplying weapons into armed conflicts in which multiple competing and overlapping non-state armed groups operate . ”
The analysis of more than 40,000 items found that in total , however , about 90 per cent of the weapons and ammunition overall were made in Russia , China and Eastern Europe .
Three per cent of Isis ' arsenal was Nato-grade . The report also found that over the last three years had been able to produce its own military-grade weapons and standardise production across the so-called caliphate .

Beijing ( CNN ) -- One of China 's most prominent activists and their wife are under house arrest and have been beaten by authorities , two human rights groups , China Aid and Chinese Human Rights Defenders said Friday .
In a home video released Wednesday by U.S.-based rights group China Aid , Chen Guangcheng described the dire and frustrating conditions of their house arrest , since they were released from jail in September . They said police have threatened to throw them back in jail without recourse .
`` I 've come out of a small jail and entered a bigger one ( house arrest ) , '' Chen , 39 , said in the video , wearing sunglasses and a black jacket . `` Those people stand at the four corners of my house and spy on my family and monitor what we do ... floodlights have been installed around my house and surveillance cameras . ''
Vehicles surround their home , and their land line and mobile phone have been cut off . Chen said anyone in the community who attempts to help them is threatened by the authorities .
`` My house is basically under surveillance 24 hours a day and we ca n't get out of the house and the same thing happens to my wife , '' described Chen . `` Only my mother can go out to get something for us to eat and stay alive . ''
On Friday , the Hong Kong-based China Human Rights Defenders reported Chen and their wife Yuan Weijin were severely beaten after the public release of the video showing Chen discussing their house arrest at home .
`` According to our source , the beating was not light but also was not life threatening , '' Wang Songlian of China Human Rights Defenders told CNN in a phone interview .
Calls to local authorities went unanswered .
Chen and their wife have not been allowed to visit a hospital or see a doctor , the organization said . Cheng has been ill for several months now with an intestinal infection and they have not been able to seek medical attention , according to CHRD .
`` What they do now is is what I call thuggery , '' Chen said in the video . `` First they provoke you through various means and stir up trouble . After all , no matter how they beat me , the judicial organs will turn a deaf ear since it is done on the order of the Party Committee . ''
Chen is a well-known activist in China .
In 1998 , they led farmers in Yinan County , where their hometown is located , to protest against a river-polluting paper factory and persuaded an international donor to fund a deep well for drinking water as alternative to the polluted river water .
They later set up a center for rights of the handicapped and filed a case against a public transport company in Beijing for refusing to honor the law providing free rides to them .
Chen brought class-action lawsuits on behalf of families impacted by China 's enforcement of family-planning laws , which limit couples to one child .
After their years of activism , the People 's Court of Yinan County sentenced Chen to four years and three months in prison in August 2006 on charges of `` willfully damaging property '' and `` organizing a mob to disturb traffic . ''
Chen 's supporters called the charges preposterous .
Last month , in the lead up to Chinese President Hu Jintao 's visit to the United States , Secretary of State Hillary Clinton called for the release of Chen , Nobel Peace Prize laureate Liu Xiaobo , along with other political prisoners who are `` enduring enforced disappearances . ''
A “ human rights ” conference at the University of Connecticut was in disarray after almost all the speakers pulled out . The Hartford Courant reports today :
Four of the five speakers scheduled to address a conference on human rights scheduled for [ today ] Tuesday at the University of Connecticut canceled Monday , with one of those speakers saying they would not come because the event was honoring Israeli President Shimon Peres .
The Electronic Intifada was the first to report on Sunday that Bahrain rights defender Maryam Al-Khawaja had withdrawn from the UNESCO-sponsored conference that was due to honor their father , political prisoner Abdulhadi Al-Khawaja , because the same event is honoring Peres .
“ Whilst I am honored that you chose my father , I am also utterly disappointed that you would honor them alongside a person who has been responsible for many human rights violations and should be put on trial , not honored , ” Al-Khawaja wrote in an open letter .
The Hartford Courant adds :
It was not immediately clear why the other speakers canceled , but Stephanie Reitz , spokesperson for the university said “ It 's disappointing . I 'm sure they all had a lot of interesting things to share. ” But they said the event would go forward Tuesday with some modification . They said the only speaker scheduled is Peres ' son-in-law and personal physician , Raphael Walden , a vascular surgeon who was chief of surgery at Sheba and has been a visiting professor at Masschusetts General Hospital in Boston .
The other speakers at the 13th Annual UNESCO Chair & Institute of Comparative Human Rights Conference at the University of Connecticut on 23 October , titled “ Legacies Of Human Rights Leadership And Struggles ” were due to be Akemi Kochiyama-Sardinha , granddaughter and biographer of grassroots civil rights activist Yuri Kochiyama , Samia Nkrumah , daughter of Ghana independence leader Kwame Nkrumah , and Shehrbano Taseer , daughter of Salmaan Taseer , the governor of Pakistan 's Punjab province who was assassinated in January 2011 .
Last night , opponents of the honor to Peres held an alternative event titled “ What Legacy of Human Rights Leadership ? The Truth About Shimon Peres and Israel/Palestine , ” featuring Lenni Brenner , Stanley Heller , and J. Kēhaulani Kauanui .
Stanley Heller , executive director of the Middle East Crisis Committee , told the Courant , “ The UNESCO conference is a great idea to honor people who have fought for human rights , but they are making a huge mistake with Shimon Peres . ”
Kauanui , a Wesleyan University professor who serves on the Advisory Board of the US Campaign for the Academic and Cultural Boycott of Israel ( USACBI ) said in an email to the Courant , “ Peres and the State of Israel are responsible for the violent domination of the Palestinian people through colonialism , occupation , and apartheid . These three prongs of brutal oppression are not only illegal , each is the very antithesis of human rights , democracy and freedom . ”
On Monday , PACBI , the Palestinian Campaign for the Academic and Cultural Boycott of Israel , publicly thanked Al-Khawaja for their stance . “ From Palestine to Bahrain , we stand with you , firm in the knowledge that only together , supporting each other 's struggles , can we free ourselves , ” the statement said .
REUTERS - Egypt 's President Abdel Fattah al-Sissi said on Sunday a referendum on the independence of Iraq 's Kurdish region would lead to a `` catastrophic '' break up of the country , which is facing an onslaught by Sunni Islamist militants .
The comments from Sissi , leader of the most populous Arab nation , indicate a growing fear in the region that the division of Iraq could further empower the insurgents who have declared a `` caliphate '' on land seized in Iraq and neighboring Syria .
`` The referendum that the Kurds are asking for now is in reality no more than the start of a catastrophic division of Iraq into smaller rival states , '' Egypt 's MENA news agency quoted Sissi as saying during a meeting with local journalists .
The president of Iraq 's autonomous Kurdish north , Massoud Barzani , asked the region 's parliament on Thursday to prepare the way for a referendum on independence .
http : //www.haaretz.com/news/world/.premium-1.603193
Iraq 's five million Kurds , who have ruled themselves in relative peace since the 1990s , have expanded their territory by up to 40 percent in recent weeks as the Sunni Islamist militants seized vast stretches of western and northern Iraq .
Egypt , a traditionally regional diplomatic heavy weight , has been embroiled in domestic turmoil for three years since a 2011 uprising ousted autocratic President Hosni Mubarak .
Sissi said they warned the United States and Europe about the ambitions of the Islamic State militants , which have shortened their name from the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria ( ISIS )

`` ISIS had a plan to take over Egypt , '' Sissi said . `` I had warned the United States and Europe from providing any aid to them and told them they will come out of Syria to target Iraq then Jordan then Saudi Arabia . ''
Sissi , Egypt 's former army chief , last year orchestrated the ouster of the state 's Islamist President Mohamed Morsi , who was elected in a free vote , in reaction to mass protests against their rule .
Sissi 's interim government that ruled until their election had cracked down on Islamists . Thousands of Islamist activists and members in Morsi 's Muslim Brotherhood group have been jailed since Morsi 's ouster last July and hundreds of street protesters were killed .
The Muslim Brotherhood group , the state 's oldest and most organized movement , is now banned and declared a terrorist organization .
Gerald Herbert/Associated Press LSU 's Kenny Hilliard could find themselves in backup duty again next season .
Running back Kenny Hilliard will return to LSU next season rather than declare eligibility for the NFL draft . And while Hilliard might not have been the running back Tigers fans hoped would stay , the program 's backup running back served notice that they do n't mind competing with incoming first-year student Leonard Fournette , the nation 's consensus No . 1 running back recruit .
Hilliard took to Twitter with their decision :
To close to graduating from NFL can wait â kenny hilliard ( @ noceilings27 ) January 13 , 2014
LSU 's Sports Information Department confirmed to nola.com on Monday that running back Alfred Blue will not return to LSU , either .
Hilliard , the nephew of former LSU and New Orleans Saints running back Dalton Hilliard , was mired in backup duty behind starter Jeremy Hill last season along with Terrence Magee and Blue . They rushed for 310 yards and seven touchdowns on 68 carries . Hilliard lost weight in the offseason in hopes of earning more playing time , but it was n't meant to be as Hill took over the majority of carries , and Magee made a surprising move to garner a few carries per game as well .
Underclassmen for 2014 draft Take a look at the list of players who have announced their intentions to apply for early entry into the 2014 Take a look at the list of players who have announced their intentions to apply for early entry into the 2014 NFL Draft , including Texas A & M QB Johnny Manziel . More ...
Hilliard ( 6-foot , 230 pounds ) is the first of LSU 's underclassmen considering an early jump to the NFL to decide against it . Hill declared their intentions to enter the draft earlier Monday , as did offensive guard Trai Turner . Along with Blue , defensive tackles Anthony Johnson and Ego Ferguson have announced they will enter the draft , while wide receivers Odell Beckham and Jarvis Landry will reportedly do so as well . That makes a whopping 17 LSU underclassmen to declare for early draft entry over the last two seasons , including seven following the 2013 campaign , and Tigers left tackle La'El Collins might soon make it eight .
With the exits of Blue and Hill , Hilliard and Magee are the only running backs with any experience left to compete against Fournette , whom many expect to take over the position . Although Hilliard has yet to run for more than 500 yards in a season as a career backup , they have shown a nose for the end zone with 20 career touchdowns and has excelled as a short-yardage option .
If they want a bigger role than that in their senior season , however , he 'll have to beat out the nation 's top prep rusher to do so .

A new report by city staff recommends that council allows municipal officers , special constables and peace officers to direct traffic .
The report suggests that in addition to police officers , the city could utilize trained civilians to direct traffic and close highways in short-term situations .
The report indicates that this change could be made under the current Highway Traffic Act .
“ Even though a special constable is not a ‘ police officer ' as defined in the PSA , a special constable can be given the partial authority of a police officer for limited purposes , ” the report states .
In 2015 , more than 3,000 Toronto police officers obtained paid duty work at an hourly rate of $ 68 for a total of more than $ 25 million . The city paid nearly $ 1.5 million last year for paid duty work .
The use of highly trained officers , such as those who oversee construction sites or larger scale city events like Jays games , has been debated over the past few years .
Many have questioned why highly trained officers are required for such events .
The report identifies concerns within the current model including high costs , the inability of police to fill all paid duty requests and the impact these assigned shifts may have on regular police work .
Deputy Mayor Denzil Minnan-Wong told CTV Toronto that the proposed changes have the potential to ‘ free up money ' for the city .
“ It could save us a lot of money and it could allow us to do many different things , ” they said . “ If it freed up that type of money , we could deploy more people and more police officers into the community . So it makes a lot of sense . ”
The president of the Toronto Police Association told CP24 that the police union is open to discussing possible changes but does not believe that the suggestions will help reduce the $ 1-billion police budget .
McCormack added that many of the paid duty assignments police officers perform do not involve traffic or highways .
“ In a lot of national sporting events there is a pre-requirement to have uniformed police officers , ” they said . “ It is a whole sort of smoke-screen that by the city doing this that it is going to have an impact on big events like that . ”
Councillor Gord Perks told CTV Toronto they would welcome the changes if approved .
“ Directing traffic and making sure traffic happens safely is something you can provide very specific training for , ” said Perks . “ You do n't need the full suite of training to be a police officer to safely direct traffic , so it would be a welcome reform . ”
The staff report is on the agenda for next week 's executive committee meeting .

The Hennepin County sheriff 's department will start using a drone this summer provided federal approval comes through .
Department spokesperson Jon Collins said the drone will be used for “ search and rescue ” operations and run by volunteer special deputies .
Drones , unmanned aerial vehicles , cost a fraction of other overhead options , such as using the state patrol 's helicopter . Drone use already has proliferated among U.S. law enforcement agencies , bringing numerous privacy concerns along with it . While drones could be a safer , more efficient search option over a broad area or rough terrain than dozens of human volunteers , the devices have the capability to get into much deeper surveillance with digital monitoring and listening capabilities .
“ Obviously , privacy is something that 's very important to us in this , ” Collins said .
Drones require authorization from the Federal Aviation Administration ( FAA ) and Hennepin County is awaiting word on its application .
The U.S. Customs and Border Patrol agency has been flying drones for several years in border areas . In 2013 , the San Francisco-based Electronic Frontier Foundation reported drone usage across the country . The nonprofit , which says it 's “ defending your rights in a digital world , ” has n't conducted a more recent survey . The organization had to sue in 2012 to get information from the FAA about applications for drone licenses .
Mark Thompson , who oversees the public safety departments at the county , said administrators were aware that the sheriff was going to start using the devices . “ Drones are a relatively inexpensive technology that can be deployed to survey accident , hostage or crime scenes to provides video/ intelligence information to responding officers , ” they said .
Drone issues already are flying at the Legislature this session with lawmakers looking at regulations regarding when , where and by whom they can be flown and for what purposes .

Harry here . This article is a re-post of one we did a couple months ago but in light of the recent Uber incident , it 's more relevant than ever . If there was one criticism of the way the driver handled the passenger , it 's that they did n't do a good job defusing the situation . In this article , RSG contributor , Christian Perea , takes a look at how to deal with the drunk , drugged and disorderly .
It 's 1:00 AM on a Saturday . You get a request from the Bro-Magnon Monster Club in the busiest part of downtown .
The passengers are rated 5 stars , they must be leaving the club before the rush . This means they are smart . They are calculated . “ They are n't going to puke in my car ! ” you think to yourself .
You know you need to haul ass to get there and complete this trip ( and return ) before the actual rush happens . That way you can get some Surge/PT to make up for your slow day since everyone seems to drive on the weekends now . You burn some yellow lights and get to your destination quickly .
After cutting through the long line of Taxi drivers you arrive at the club for a perfect pickup only to find this ;
“ Is they going to be okay ? ” “ Yeah man , he 'll be fine. ” At this point , Bro-Magnon 1 slips into the back seat of your car as their friends shuffle in . Bro-Magnon 1 immediately rolls down the window and falls asleep while muttering “ I 'm fine. ” You complete the rest of the ride as the rest of Bro-Magnons Beta friends ask you where they can score some coke/molly/whatever Kanye West was on at the VMAs as they sing along to Bieber 's “ What Do You Mean ? ” on repeat . You drive along and try to block it all out while keeping an eye on Bro-Magnon 1 through the rearview mirror . They are beginning to burp . Gurgle . Burple . “ I can make it if I drive slower . This will all be over soon ” You arrive at the destination . Everyone exits . Everyone except Bro-Magnon 1 . They are unconscious and not responsive . Everyone tries to wake them up . They eventually awaken but is unable to move . They lurch forward from the backseat and pukes all over the back of your neck , down the rear of your seat , and into the little crevices of the door .
You have failed to control the situation .
Get Yourself On Point
Most of the time the late night crowd is just as banal as the daylight crowd . Perhaps a little drunker , but still the same “ Do you like driving for X/Y ” kind of conversations . I drive a lot at night because there is less traffic , and I like to listen to my music loudly as I traverse the streets with impunity . I trade constantly bad traffic for sometimes bad passengers .
Usually you will get one bad passenger during a late night run . This comes in many forms . The one thing in common with handling all of them is maintaining control and being assertive . Whenever I speak with Uber Black drivers this is the number one tip they bring up . There are big reasons they do these things that have nothing to do with showmanship .
Exit the vehicle when possible to greet your passengers with a firm handshake and introduce yourself . This helps to humanize you as something beyond “ their Uber driver ” . It also makes you appear to provide excellent service .
Most people are n't even aware that we have legs so when they see you standing at the vehicle and notice that you introduce yourself , it catches them off-guard . By doing this you set the tone that you run a tight ship and are more likely to make them respect you and your property .
Doing this will also let you assess every passenger before they enter your vehicle . You can see if they are traveling with alcohol or if they will attempt to squeeze in a fifth person . Inevitably , somebody will try to do one of these things .
When this happens , it is VERY important that you do not chide or belittle them . Instead you want to explain that it is against the law , and that they will not be covered under insurance . I go further and say “ by trying to do this you are placing me at a great deal of legal risk , there are a lot of cops out tonight . ”
Most of the time , you can unite the person requesting the ride against all of these “ regulations ” and get them to rant about “ how the man is keeping us down , man . ”
Now I realize that a lot of the time we ca n't park and exit the vehicle . If this is not possible , I generally do the handshake and turn around to count the number of passengers and assess whether or not they have any cargo . If they do , I act accordingly .
Minimize Rating Risk : Now here is another important part . If they respond with ANY argument , attitude , or bullshit to your request , you screen-shot the ride and cancel it as a no-show . I tend to tell them “ you are not welcome in my car , I am going to have to cancel this ride since you have attempted to put me into this risky position ” .
If you have to leave the scene to cancel the ride safely then do so . Any person who is going to argue with you about following the law does not respect you and they will reflect that if you drive them . They will also reflect that in your rating . When you have arrived in a safe location you can choose to email the screenshot to support if you feel like that will do anything .
Get Emesis Bags : You can find them at almost any drug store ( or buy them on Amazon ) . Many drivers keep them in the pouch that is generally behind the seats , plus one in the glove-box . I like to keep mine out of sight and deeper within the pouches and only have them taken out when I can read that someone is feeling sick .
Clean Your Equipment : One of the most common compliments I get is on how well I keep my car clean . I never go more than two days without vacuuming my carpet and cleaning my seats until they look new again . This has more importance than just looking nice . It sets the tone that you take care of your equipment and that they should too . You lead them by example . Usually someone has to be insanely drunk before they leave anything in my car . It also helps that I do n't pass out water or candy for them to leave behind .
The Car Does n't Work When You Are n't Buckled In : “ All right , kids . Seatbelts ! ” I have literally said that line more than 2000 times . I am sure of it . I say it half jokingly . The other half of the joke is making them realize “ I should n't have to be reminded to put my seatbelt on. ” Every time the response begins with “ Oh yeah… ”
Consider A Dash Cam : In light of the recent Uber driver incident , a good dash cam ( like this one on Amazon ) should be at the top of your list since you never know when you 'll need it .
Unstable and On Drugs
Sometimes you will begin driving someone and realize a few minutes into the ride that they are unstable . This could be from a drug that they took , the fact that they are emotionally unstable , or that they had a little too much to drink .
Most of these passengers can just be simply placated by asking those questions that make them expand on whatever drunken babble they are speaking . I used to work in mental health , so often I just revert to my training in dealing with people in a crisis .
Most of it is n't that specialized though . If you keep them talking , they often forget that they are crazy and skip the part where they cry and tell you about their ex . Here are some basic tactics :
Redirecting : When a passenger is beginning to exhibit unstable behavior , you can use redirection of the conversation or their focus in order to calm them down . Often this takes the form of telling a joke or asking them a question . You can also create a distraction by pointing out something on the road and asking them what they think about it .
Processing and Counseling : Sometimes people just want someone to talk about their problems . A form of a confession booth with none of the religiosity involved . I have found this happens with many of the people who drink and have had a bad night . Perhaps they are lonely . Perhaps they are just down on their luck or feeling sad . Whenever I get one of these people , I try to ask them leading questions about what ( or why ) they are sad about .
Reframing : Take whatever they are depressed or upset about and shed some silver lining on it . Tell them that if Becky/Bobby rejected them , it may have saved them a trip to the Herpes Doctor . In all realness though , you can shed light on some of their problems from a different angle that they would never have realized .
Just Listen to Them Ramble : Sometimes it 's fun to hear the rambling . Sometimes they just want to talk at something . What they do n't realize is that they are n't so much asking for your counsel as much as they are verbally processing their events to themselves .
Ask them if you should get a cat : I swear , it works every time . You can use it on anybody one time until they figure out the ruse . Also works on parents , girlfriends , children , friends , people on dates , etc .
Do NOT : Escalate your passenger . The focus should be on making them calmer and more relaxed . Sometimes it may seem easy to say cheeky things to them . Especially if you are me . Thing is , in the case of an unstable passenger you are n't dealing with a logical or sentient person . You are dealing with whatever chemical reaction their brain is having to whatever they are on .
If It Hits the Fan :
Call 911 : If you are in an emergency . Stop reading my article .
In the event that you are unable to , or just suspect something is up , here are some other options . Many of these are a last resort though .
Taser/Pepper Spray : This is controversial . Some say that we can get deactivated from a platform by having pepper spray or a Taser . Even if this is true , I would rather be deactivated from UberX than permanently deactivated from life . I have seen many , many people with tasers and pepper spray . Get it and keep it out of reach of your passengers . You may also want to avoid pepper spray since any violence could take place within an enclosed environment ( your car ) .
Voxer or Glympse : Voxer allows you to record audio to a group of friends in case something bad is happening so start a Voxer group !
Related Podcast : Using Teamwork ( And Voxer ! ) To Increase Your Rideshare Earnings
Glympse is an application that will send a link to your contacts via text message that allows them to track your GPS location for as long as 48 hours . Have an emergency contact or friend and tell them that if they ever get a Glympse alert from you to send the Police .
Know Your Police Stations : It 's a longstanding and proud tradition of many cab drivers to kick out their unruly and unsafe passengers in front of the police station . Learn where they are located in your community . This also insulates you from any violent retribution from your passenger . If one is not nearby than you can try a well-lit and public place .
Lyft Critical Response : 855-865-9553 24/7/365 and instantaneous .
Uber Critical Response : There is none . Which is sad . Especially in light of this . Or this .
So if you are on point and on top of your game in working with people you can take advantage of the late night rush and take advantage of the earnings potential there . The vast majority of your passengers during the rush will be perfect passengers and you may even have some fun yourself . Following these guidelines will help you work with any drunk , drugged , or disorderly passengers . Just remember to stay on top of your game .
Drivers , what do you think about my suggestions for driving around during the late nights ? Do you mind driving around the drunk , drugged and disorderly or would you rather drive around during the day when things are a bit calmer ?

With the federal government already running annual deficits in excess of $ 1 trillion , a liberal think tank is calling on Uncle Sam to spend hundreds of billions more on “ universal preschool ” and child care — a proposal that could well make its way into President Barack Obama 's impending State of the Union address .
The Center for American Progress ( CAP ) , which the Associated Press describes as “ an influential partner for the White House in fleshing out its policies , ” released its proposal on February 7 . The plan calls for Washington to spend almost $ 200 billion over the next 10 years , followed by nearly $ 25 billion each year thereafter , to “ make high-quality preschool universally accessible to all 3- and 4-year-old children ” and to “ enable more lower-income families to afford child care for children ages 0-3 years old . ”
The first part of the CAP 's proposal :
All children age 3 and 4 should be able to voluntarily attend a full-day public preschool program . Preschool should be free for children from families at or below 200 percent of the federal poverty line ( $ 46,100 for a family of four ) . Children from families above 200 percent of the poverty line should be charged a sliding tuition co-pay , ranging from about 30 percent of the cost to 95 percent of the cost ( for families above 400 percent of the poverty line ) .
Besides the cost to taxpayers , estimated at $ 98.4 billion over the first 10 years and $ 12.3 billion in each subsequent year , there are a number of troubling things in this part of the plan .
First , note the emphasis on public preschool . The objective clearly is to get as many children into the clutches of the state educational system as early as possible . As the CAP observed elsewhere in its proposal , “ Years of research demonstrate that the first five years of a child 's cognitive and emotional development establish the foundation for learning and achievement throughout life. ” The sooner the government can begin molding the minds of children , the more likely they are to grow up to be compliant , subservient cogs in the state 's machinery rather than free-thinking , self-reliant individuals .
Second , the notion that preschool should be “ free ” or even partially subsidized implies that parents of preschoolers have a prior claim on the earnings of others .
Third , the fact that even families making over four times the poverty line qualify for subsidies means that all parents who choose to send their children to preschool — a number that will surely increase when it is subsidized — will become beholden to Washington . That , too , ensures a compliant populace .
The money doled out by the federal government under this proposal is intended to match state spending on preschool , which means taxpayers will be soaked for preschool subsidies twice . It also means that Washington will impose more dictates on states , and the CAP is not lacking for suggestions in that department , either . Among other things , it recommends requiring states to “ offer full-day kindergarten ” ( more time for kids to be shaped by the state ) , to bring down teacher-child ratios and class sizes ( more public employees and buildings ) , and to “ develop early learning guidelines for literacy , numeracy , and social and emotional development ” ( more opportunities for the government to intrude on parental prerogatives ) .
Those providers eligible to receive the money “ should include local education agencies ( school districts , charter schools ) , Head Start programs , child care agencies , and community-based providers of prekindergarten programs in partnership with local education agencies , ” according to the CAP . This , the AP suggests , is “ a concession that could win over Republicans who want more options for parents . ”
The second part of the CAP 's proposal is to expand child-care subsidies and Early Head Start , a program for pregnant women and families with low incomes .
“ Specifically , ” writes the think tank , “ the federal government would offer states substantially higher grant amounts through the Child Care and Development Fund , or CCDF , on the condition that they spend $ 1 for every $ 3 the federal government spends. ” This is expected to double the number of families on the child-care dole at a 10-year cost of $ 84.2 billion with a maintenance cost of $ 10.5 billion in each subsequent year . And taxpayers would again take a hit — to the tune of a third of these prices — at the state level .
This , too , would enable more federal control over state functions . The CAP would have Washington impose child-care standards on states and “ implement a Quality Rating and Improvement System ... for their federally funded child care programs . ”
The CAP also wants to “ double enrollment in Early Head Start , ” which would cost $ 11.5 billion over 10 years and $ 1.44 billion each year thereafter . Since the program begins working with families before a child is even born , it essentially gives the government an early head start on turning out compliant citizens . The program 's website states that Early Head Start even includes home visits by government employees , “ especially for families with newborns ” — a golden opportunity either to force parents to do as the state says or to take their child from them . Then there are “ parent education ” and “ comprehensive health and mental health services , ” which are also fraught with dangers .
All told , the CAP proposals would cost taxpayers at the federal level alone nearly $ 200 billion in their first decade , with billions more in the decades to come ; and as with most estimates of government programs , they will probably end up costing far more .
Clearly , all of this spending is unconstitutional . But even if it were constitutional , would it be wise at a time when the U.S. Treasury is running astronomical deficits ?
According to the “ progressives ” at the CAP , the answer is yes . “ This concern [ over deficits ] is understandable but misplaced . Studies show that investing money in high-quality preschool will actually improve our country 's fiscal health by strengthening human capital , enhancing economic growth , increasing revenues , and decreasing future spending obligations. ” Why , even Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke agrees with them on this , they point out . And Bernanke , of course , has never been wrong about anything .
Then again , even CAP president and CEO Neera Tanden admitted in remarks to the AP that the alleged payoff wo n't occur for “ 10 or 20 years. ” Can the federal government really afford to pile on more debt for another couple of decades in hopes of reaping some ephemeral future savings ?
Will the CAP 's proposal wind up in Obama 's State of the Union speech ? Certainly the administration seems to be thinking along these lines already . According to the AP , “ Education Department officials , including Secretary Arne Duncan , have signaled that pre-kindergarten programs would be a priority during Obama 's second term. ” Tanden themselves is a former high-level adviser in the Obama administration ( as well as in Obama 's 2008 presidential campaign ) , which suggests that they have a good feel for what the president wants and the connections to get the CAP 's proposal before their eyes . The AP observes that “ seldom does the organization move too far or too quickly ahead of White House priorities . ”
If Obama does propose these costly , worrisome , and unconstitutional initiatives , Congress should hold its applause . A poor reception just might convince them not to bother sending any such bills to Capitol Hill .
How We Founded a Positive News Organization
Lessons from an Indian initiative trying to usher-in positive news in a market saturated with sensationalism
Dhimant Parekh Blocked Unblock Follow Aug 26 , 2013
It was a little over 5 years ago that my wife and I decided to start an alternative news medium . We were exasperated by reading the daily news in India that was largely negative and sensational in nature .
It got us thinking :
What should news do to you ?
Should it shake you up in horror ? Should it leave you in disgust ? Or should it also make you learn ? Should it make you contribute ? Should it enable you to bring about a change ?
With that idea , we decided to start our own news site , but with a difference . We decided to report only positive news . And by positive , we did n't want it to be preachy or opinion-filled , we wanted to talk about ideas that have impacted communities , we wanted to showcase people who have brought about a change in their areas , we wanted to talk about forgotten art forms of India , celebrate the successes of organizations who 've improved the lives of many children , display the enormous achievements of groups working to eliminate poverty , showcase innovative movements like those of a photography club for the visually impaired — the list continues to grow with every passing day .
Start Small . But Start .
All that listed above did n't really come to us on that fine day . What struck us was what we had to do — start a website of positive news . We started as a filter blog on blogspot , linking to articles from various publications as and when we found them . But this too became difficult simply because there were very few articles out there in other publications that fit our ‘ positive criteria ' .
Pivot . Of course .
So we pivoted to covering news ourselves . We , as a team of 2 , went around Bangalore , the city we live in , to discover and know more about individuals and organizations . We covered these folks , captured photographs and put them up on our blog . We circulated the stories on Facebook and e-mail .
Get the ‘ Network Effect ' going .
We pushed our content to as many people as we could — family , friends , friends of friends , colleagues , friends of colleagues and so on.The idea was appreciated by all and , more importantly , shared by many . So we continued to work on it persistently for 6 months . And then , one person mailed us volunteering to join us on this journey . And they had a journalism background too , which neither one of us did . We were thrilled !
Going from 2 to 25 in 5 .
This one person joining in gave us the ability to cover a different city . It gave a different writing style to the articles . It gave us perspective . We continued to push content to our network , and then one more person joined in . This person brought in a different mindset and so our articles became more varied . Our readers started loving us more . And so more of them spread the word . And then more writers wanted to be a part of it . And thus we went to 25 writers in 5 years . 25 writers who write for the passion of spreading positive news . 25 writers who believe that we can bring about a change .
Amplify Conversations .
We identified early on that a large section of our readers liked us and wanted to share about us . So we got onto Twitter and Facebook early-on and invested a lot in having conversations with our audience all the time . This helped us get a lot of leads for both our articles and writers . And then we focused on e-mail . We hooked up MailChimp and used their fantastic drip e-mail ( they call it autoresponders ) facility to ensure that we run our new readers through some of our best articles before they start getting our daily alerts . We also ensured to send them a mail asking them to talk about us with their contacts — adding in a paragraph of content which they could just copy and paste in their mails . It quickly became one of the top 10 sources of reader traffic !
Be At It .
We did this , and continue to do this , for over 5 years now . The reason we remained persistent — We heard from every reader that they absolutely loved what we were doing ! This was not one-off from friends and family , this was from every random person who talked to us . They all loved it . And hence we decided to Be . At . It .
We 've covered some amazing people and ideas and we continue to be surprised everyday . Some of our best stories have been of extraordinary effort that some people have taken to bring about changes , some of them are here for you to read :
The Bird Man of Kheechan
A Wedding with a Difference that Made a Difference
‘ Ahmedabad No Rickshawalo '
Making 1.5 Million Meals Daily in less than 5 hours
There are thousands of such stories covered in the past years and we hope to continue to grow this movement . We hope to show that news can do a lot more than what it does today .

Charlie Murphy , Eddie Murphy 's older brother and an accomplished funnyman in their own right , died Wednesday in New York after a battle with leukemia .
The 57-year-old funnyman 's passing was confirmed by their rep Domenick Nati .
The elder Murphy 's manager told TMZ that their client had been undergoing chemotherapy .
At 10 p.m. Tuesday , the Brooklyn native tweeted , “ One to Sleep On : Release the past to rest as deeply as possible . ”
“ Our hearts are heavy with the loss today of our son , brother , father , uncle and friend Charlie , ” the Murphy family said in statement Wednesday evening . “ Charlie filled our family with love and laughter and there wo n't be a day that goes by that their presence will not be missed . Thank you for the outpouring of condolences and prayers . ”
Their next gig had been scheduled for May 13 at the Joe Louis Arena in Detroit , appearing with Cedric The Entertainer , Eddie Griffin , D.L . Hughley and George Lopez in “ The Comedy Get Down . ”
After a recent “ Get Down ” show , Lopez said Murphy texted their co-stars : “ Great seeing you guys and living the magic last night . Great show brothers ! ! ! ! ! ”
“ I 'm heartbroken at the passing of our brother Charlie , ” Lopez wrote on Instagram with a picture of the two of them .
Lopez said Murphy was never shy in sharing love and warmth .
“ In relationships you never want to leave anything unsaid , our conversations before shows and after shows we all told each other and Charlie how we felt ! Keep their family in your thoughts and in your prayers and keep a space for Charlie in you 're [ sic ] heart . ”
Cedric The Entertainer also paid tribute via Instagram and called Murphy a “ bad man and funny af . ”
“ He was honest and straight shooter , no BS kinda dude , awesome Father and family man , ” Cedric wrote .
Cedric said they were always impressed at how Charlie Murphy handled the fame of their younger brother , while etching a comedy career of their own .
“ Had a gregarious laugh that would make you laugh , they stood on their own 2 feet as a man and as a comic even in the shadows of the brother of one of the greatest to have ever done it , ” according to Cedric . “ Listening to Charlie tell stories of their life was truly one of my greatest past times [ sic ] . ”
Murphy is survived by three kids after their wife , Tisha Taylor Murphy , died of cancer in 2009 .
The comic loved performing – but adored their family more ,
“ After every gig , they rushed home to be with their kids , ” Hughley tweeted . “ He died with gigs on the books . ”
Ice Cube said they owed a bit of their career to Charlie Murphy .
“ Damn , sorry to hear about my friend Charlie Murphy , ” tweeted Ice Cube , who made their directorial debut in the movie “ The Player 's Club ” with Murphy . “ He took a chance on a young director in The Player 's Club . Always made me laugh . RIP . ”
Murphy 's on-screen credits include “ CB4 , ” “ Our Family Wedding , ” ” King 's Ransom , ” “ Mo ' Better Blues , ” “ Night at the Museum ” and “ Jungle Fever . ”
They and their younger brother are both credited with writing the movies “ Vampire in Brooklyn ” and “ Norbit . ”
Charlie and Eddie Murphy appeared on screen together in “ Harlem Nights ” in 1989 and “ Norbit ” in 2007 .
Fellow Brooklyn funnyman Chris Rock lamented Murphy 's passing , tweeting : “ We just lost one of the funniest most real brothers of all time . Charlie Murphy RIP . ”
Murphy might be best known for playing in the most hilarious pickup basketball game in entertainment history .
Back in the mid-'80s when Eddie Murphy 's comedy and Prince 's music careers were taking off , their crews hung out one late night . Prince invited the whole party back to their house to play basketball .
Murphy 's crew changed into athletic gear to play Prince and their pals — even as they were still dressed in frilly concert costumes .
“ It was wild . I was like they ai n't thinking about playing ball in that , but they were , ” Charlie Murphy narrated in a skit by Dave Chappelle that immortalized the game .
Murphy recalled mocking Prince : “ You know what we 're going to call this , the shirts against … the blouses . ”
That comment did n't sit well with the Purple One .
“ And when I said that , this [ fired-up ] look came on their face and I 'm looking back at them thinking to myself , ‘ What are you angry about ? I mean you know where you got that shirt from , and it damns sure was n't the men 's department . ' ”
Prince 's crew went on to crush the Murphys and their pals .
Charlie remembered Prince , who played high school basketball , crossover dribbling like Allen Iverson and rebounding like Charles Barkley
“ I mean I kinda learned something that day — never judge a book by its cover , ” Murphy recalled . “ This cat ( Prince ) could ball , man . ”
After the Prince-led wipeout , the host famously served their guests pancakes .

PHILADELPHIA — Democrats unfurled a massive banner that read “ Election Fraud , # Wikileaks ” as vice presidential candidate Sen. Tim Kaine took the stage Wednesday night at the Democratic National Convention .
The banner hung briefly over the railing just above the section where Vice President Joe Biden is sitting , along with their wife Jill and other VIP guests , directly across from Kaine .
The DNC was thrown off this week when Wikileaks published tens of thousands of embarrassing internal emails from the Democratic National Committee , which showed the committee collaborated with Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton to deny their rival Sen. Bernie Sanders the nomination .
As a result of the emails , Democrats fired DNC chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz . Late Wednesday , the leak widened , as Wikileaks dumped a bunch of DNC voicemails on the web .
The leak confirmed the worst fears of many Sanders supporters , who staged a massive walkout Tuesday when Clinton was officially nominated . Protests continued inside and outside the arena Tuesday , and spilled into Wednesday , as bitterly disappointed Sanders supporters refused to give up the fight .

Gears Of War 4 marks an ambitious attempt by both Microsoft and developer The Coalition to kickstart the series once again , taking it in a new direction with a fresh cast of characters while simultaneously getting back to the more horror-focused elements of the first Gears of War game . We recently took a trip to The Coalition and came back with a bloody sack filled to the brim with details and images of the game in action , like the creepy church above , which was the setting for an intense firefight we saw early on in our demo . If you want a full-size version of any of these images , you can click on them to access it .
Windflares are devastating storms that rage across the surface of Sera during Gears 4 's campaign . Not only can they fry combatants into crispy bacon but their fierce winds fling objects across the environment , turning anyone unlucky enough to be in their path into bloody smears . During the demo , we saw that the player could use this to their advantage by shooting signs and barricades that hold cars and boulders in place , sending them flying into enemy soldiers . On a gruesomely amusing note : yes , corpses and dismembered limbs are hurled about in the wind as well .
Juvies are one of the Swarm 's more deceptive units . On their own , these little buggers are n't too hard to handle , though their speedy movements and slimeiness make them pretty creepy . However , as a group , they can take you down easily if you let them get close enough to gang up on you .
If you 're tired of the classic Lancer chainsaw finishing move , Gears Of War 4 is bringing a host of new , gory executions courtesy of a handy combat knife . The execution animation changes depending on where your character is standing in relation to a dazed enemy , but all of them are vicious and reminiscent of the brutal stealth executions in Middle-earth : Shadow of Mordor ... just with a lot more brain matter . [ Note : the image above is technically a render and not a screenshot but it looks pretty close to the execution animations we saw in the two demos . ]
One of The Coalition 's primary goals for Gears Of War 4 is to make cover combat exciting again.The vault kick , a feature new to the series , is designed to let players slide over a piece of cover and kick an enemy in the face . This move stuns the enemy , leaving them open for an execution if the player is fast enough .
Be sure to return to our Gears Of War 4 hub throughout the month for more information on the new weapons and enemies , the history of The Coalition , and a roundtable with the game 's voice actors . You can access the hub by clicking on the banner below .
HERE 'S A SMALL RECAP
Delhi University 's Ramjas College saw members and supporters of ABVP and AISA thrashing each other over an invite for JNU 's Umar Khalid and Shehla Rashid for a cultural event . In the aftermath of the violence , Gurmehar Kaur , a Delhi University student who is also the daughter of an Indian Army martyr , made a Facebook post along with a photo of themselves holding a placard saying `` I am not afraid of ABVP '' . Them post turned into a campaign that went viral on social media and received a lot of appreciation and flak from many .
TWIST IN THE STORY
The matter escalated when cricketer Virender Sehwag , on seeing the photo of Kaur holding another placard that said , `` Pakistan did not kill my father . War did ! `` , made a sly tweet saying , `` I did n't score two triple centuries , my bat did '' . We do n't know yet whether Sehwag knew that this image of Kaur was from May 2016 and is a screen grab taken from a video campaign by activist Ram Subramaniam to build cordial relationship with Pakistan , or whether they knowingly pulled the image out of context . Sehwag 's tweet shifted the entire attention from DU violence , professors and students beaten up , Kaur 's campaign against ABVP , they being threatened with rape and death , to other issues - their father 's martyrdom , the Indian Army and of course , nationalism .
When Randeep Hooda cheered Sehwag by quoting the sly tweet they made , it got media attention as well . You can read the entire episode here , where Virender Sehwag and Randeep Hooda were accused of bullying the 20-year-old girl .

SOCIAL MEDIA ON FIRE
Not just social media , even news channels were on fire the entire day covering the issue , now being referred to as 'Gurmehar Row ' . Social media users , especially Twitterati , took out time from their busy schedules to laud Kaur for standing up for their beliefs , some to criticise them for misusing their father 's martyrdom ( which , by the way , was n't the issue at all ) , and others talking about how Pakistan indeed was the reason behind the Kargil War . From students to lawyers to senior journalists , Twitter was filled with tweets about Gurmehar Kaur that their name started trending . Now , there are over 55,000 tweets about them
REVELATIONS
As time passed by , it was figured out that Kaur 's father Captain Mandeep Singh was not killed during the Kargil War but made the supreme sacrifice while fighting militants . People who were going on rants against Kaur for saying Pakistan did not kill their father also got to know the entire story behind that placard .

ENTER BABITA PHOGAT
When journalist Rana Ayyub took a jibe at Randeep Hooda 's statement that Kaur `` is being used as a political pawn '' saying the latter is from Haryana and they are doing their bit in liberating women , it did n't go down well with Babita Phogat among many others . They responded to Ayyub saying `` We Phogat sisters are from Haryana too . What do you know about Haryana ? ''
Ayyub urged Babita to speak and stand up for Gurmehar Kaur , but Babita responded saying , `` Is it right to talk in favour of someone who does n't talk in favour of their nation ? ''
If you ( or your kiddo ) just happens to be a first through eighth grader in Birmingham , Alabama , you ( or your offspring ) will soon be playing with an XO during regularly scheduled class time . Mayor Larry Langford has recently announced that a $ 3 million deal was signed in order to bring in one laptop per child for the asupervisorstioned grades , or 15,000 XOs in total . Apparently , the schools will become the first in the nation to receive heaps of the low-cost lappies , which were sold to the district at $ 200 a pop . As for logistics , students can expect to receive their machine on April 15 , 2008 , and while pupils will be allowed to take 'em home , the school system can and will disable any that inexplicably `` disappear .

I have been a DC Comics fangirl for thirty years , and I 've never been embarrassed by that until now .
Last Saturday was Free Comic Book Day across the U.S. FCBD is traditionally when comics company , large and small , offer free issues which are designed to entice the reader into buying more of their product ( thus benefiting the comic book store ) and drawing in new readers . Usually a lot of the offerings are tuned into the latest successes of the properties in other media – there were plenty of Avengers stories for the taking last year , for example .
That 's where DC dropped the ball .
There are a ton of DC properties enjoying financial success right now . Man Of Steel , god help me , raked in over $ 650 million worldwide at the box office . Arrow pulled in 2.25 million viewers on April 30th . DC Entertainment has already signed Zac Snyder on to make a Justice League movie , and the shows Gotham and The Flash are already in development for the CW .
Now lem me throw out some comic book sales figures for you .
The # 1 selling book for March 2014 was Batman , with roughly 116,000 sales . At the very bottom was something called Zombie Tramp , with 940 . Okay , clearly Batman is DC 's bread and butter . The success of the Christopher Nolan movies corroborates this , at any rate , as does the CW picking up Gotham . So , let 's say you 're DC 's Marketing Department . You 'd think you 'd want to strike while the iron is hot and offer something designed to pull in those millions of people who ordinarily do n't read comics , but love Batman . Or Superman . Or Green Arrow . Or , hell , do something with the Flash . Start the hype machine rolling for the TV show . The point is you want something accessible to new readers that builds on the success of the licensed properties .
Instead , we got Future 's End .
Looks promising , does n't it ? You 've got Terry McGinnis , star of Batman Beyond , dominating the cover . You remember Batman Beyond . Fun show set in the future , aimed at kids . Okay , so we 've got Terry annnnnnnnnd DEAR GOD WHAT ARE THOSE THINGS .
Did I say promising ? I meant the other thing .
The new or casual reader , the target audience on FCBD , looks at that cover and at best goes “ Whoa , why are they all machines ? Lem me read this thing. ” So New Reader opens the book to see “ CENTRAL CITY , 35 YEARS FROM NOW ” so already we 've got Dystopian Future , which only has emotional resonance if one is familiar with the state of the DCU at present . We also see an older Flash working with one of their rogues , Captain Cold , WHICH AGAIN HAS NO EMOTIONAL RESONANCE WITHOUT A FAMILIARITY WITH CURRENT CONTINUITY I 'm okay , I 'm breathing – and after that , who 's the first superhero we see ?
Hey , it 's Wonder Woman , who 's too damn “ tricky ” for a movie despite being really easy to pitch , with half their body gone and replaced with a cyber-spider-monster . They have SWORDS FOR HANDS , YOU GUYS , WHOAAAAnnnnnd immediately swords one guy to death and then lops off Captain Cold 's hands before the Flash beats them to death at super-speed . Charming .
But hey , wait ! We 're not done doing grotesque things to our superheros ! And yes , do note , that in the first four pages of these things , it 's the heros we 're seeing subjected to body horror first . Flash then runs into Frankenstein 's Monster , who gives them a “ join or die ” ultimatum . Upon the expected response , the Monster opens their shirt to reveal WHAT THE ACTUAL LIVING BLUE FUCK IT 'S BLACK CANARY 'S FACE SEWN INTO Their CHEST .
This is the first four pages . This was available online to preview to hype the book . Later on , every iconic DC hero is either brutally slaughtered or assimilated , including – oh , and let me tell you how tasteful this was – Barbara Gordon as Batgirl with their legs cut off and their torso welded into the Bat-Signal . Wow . Wow , DC .
Oh , and they kill Batman . After Batman orders Terry McGinnis to go back in time to straight-up murder the dude who put the DCU on the path to this future . They cut off Batman 's arm , too . Good times .
If you follow me on Twitter , I 've been pissed off about this for a little over three days straight . Because this is insulting . It 's insulting to me as a long-term reader who enjoys superheroes doing heroic things , and it 's insulting to me as someone who was raised by a salesperson and has even the slightest grasp of marketing and target audiences . DC , you have a built-in audience of millions . Every single person watching your movies or your TV shows is a potential reader .
Who the fuck are you aiming Future 's End at ?
The kicker for me came last night when the official DC Comics twitter linked a review of Future 's End by Complex Magazine . They did this without accreditation in the tweet , so initially I thought it came from DC themselves ( which , way to read a URL , Dayna ) . Although it was n't an internal DC review , it was still presented in such a way that denoted full support of the views contained therein , so I 'm not letting them off the hook entirely .
The sentence that galled me was “ If you like your heroes to be snarky , smiling do-gooders , Futures End probably is n't for you. ” Oh , you mean the “ smiling do-gooders ” that are raking in billions upon billions of dollars for Marvel Entertainment ? Those guys ? I 'm sorry , it does n't look like my taste in superhero is antiquated . Remember , no one at DC wrote this , but they sure as shit endorsed it . So what does that say to me ?
“ You 're old . You 're out of date . Our comics are n't for you anymore. ” Well , I 'm a woman , so I expected that attitude already , what with you making all the Amazons of Themiscyra rapists and not doing a Wonder Woman movie and ripping off Black Canary 's face and all . But I did n't expect it to be in stark black-and-white like that . I did n't expect that DC would forget the word “ hero ” in “ superhero. ” It 's not just that they forgot it , but that they are actively decrying it . Superheroics are a thing of the past . This is for mature readers who are into blood and guts and rape and death and mutilation , WOOOOOO !
Fuck that attitude .
I 've gotten into discussions about DC vs. Marvel with friends , and I 've always said I like the DC heroes more because they are someone you can aspire to be like . Role models as heroes . Marvel heroes are generally those you can relate to as a person like yourself and identify with their struggles . These are generalizations , of course , but I have to say , Marvel 's getting it right lately . They 're certainly accepting of a diverse audience , and expanding their titles to bring in that audience . The new Ms. Marvel is Muslim . Ultimate Spider-Man Miles Morales is half-black , half-Hispanic . The adjectiveless X-Men title at the moment is comprised of only women . And all these titles are hits . People , by and large , in all fiction and not just comics , want representation . They want heroes they can see themselves in . That 's working on Marvel 's end , really really well .
DC 's taking their heroes and ripping them apart . Literally . There 's no attempt to connect with the reader on an emotional level and that 's what pisses me off . What 's worse , it sells like hotcakes . People buy this shit . They see that dark sells ( see also : Man Of Steel ) , so they push dark . The Joker cuts off their face , so mutilation sells . You 've got the game Injustice : Gods Among Us , so violence sells . It 's fucking making them tons of money , but it 's taking away the heart of DC . The inspiration , the heroism . The part of the universe that hooked me as a child of four and kept me reading my entire life . Their target audience is the teenaged/young adult male who loves gore and mutilation and murder , the same audience who somehow thinks it 's okay to send rape threats to someone who criticized a fucking comic book cover for being shitty . They are actively targeting the audience who are acting like total fucking assholes . And it 's selling .
That 's the worst part . It 's selling . And all it cost was their soul .
The ban of the second account was a result of posting photos of a “ paint pour test ” being conducted at The Womb in anticipation of Oliver Hibert 's exhibit opening this Friday . Below are the photos from the test the gallery and Oliver have shared :
Since last fall Instagram had almost become Wayne 's sole social media outlet ( most of their tweets are automatically posted when they publish on their Instagram account ) . On their original account they posted a treasure trove of concert photos , behind-the-scenes images of current Flaming Lips projects , rare band pictures and posters from their 30 year career , shots with other musicians ( Patrick Carney , Kesha , Jack White , Kevin Parker , etc ) , weird art , playful selfies and random scenes from their daily life .
The vast majority of the 1227 photos from their original account – all now gone – were in good standing with Instagram 's terms of use by any measure . Those that violated the “ partial nudity ” rule , were posted jokingly – like the photo of their backside during their hospital stay in October 2012 . Most of their risqué posts were art related – comic book drawings containing nudes or posters including women with bare breasts for example . Ironically their Instagram account was considerably tamer than their many pre-Instagram nude Twitter posts from August 2011 through the first half of 2012 , usual of their wife Michelle . Their Instagrams were colorful no doubt – pictures of Patrick from The Black Keys wearing a T of Wayne flipping thee bird , jokes about getting drunk with Oklahoma 's Governor – but overwhelmingly within code . A typical post for Wayne 's first account was , say , a picture with someone like Justin Bieber , a plug for a lesser known artist , a dead bird on the street he 's stumbled upon , or random oddness , like a giant eyeball under construction . However , almost as though they wanted to get kicked off again , Wayne seemed less cautious with their second account ( the one they created in September after their original account was banned ) .
The social media site clearly prohibits “ sexually suggestive photos , ” but does n't define the boundaries . Are the nudes in their comic book The Sun Is Sick too “ suggestive ” for Instagram ? What about a painting of an alien giving birth , or a nude statue ?
“ I forget that a statue of a naked woman looks a lot like an actual naked woman to someone on Instagram , ” Coyne told MTV News . “ I totally understand that Instagram has their rules and they do n't want everything to be just a wide-open thing . ”
“ I know that Instagram 's like that , but sometimes I would forget , because I 'm taking pictures of paintings and cartoons and stuff , ” they explained to nme.com . “ We had an opening at our gallery and I was doing a lot of pictures of stuff at the gallery and there was a statue we have and she 's naked , but if I take a picture , you ca n't tell if she 's a statue – and I forget that. “
Below are The Womb tweets from September ( with the now defunct Instagram links that presumably caused the ban ) :

Been kicked off Instgrammmm ! ! Dang ! ! pic.twitter.com/fued01rBaZ — Wayne Coyne ( @ waynecoyne ) September 21 , 2013
Though Wayne may not be particularly bothered by getting kicked off Instagram ( after all , they still have the photos on their phone ) , they have expressed regret for the many fans that were . Banning their account does not stop Wayne from posting more photos ( under a different user name ) after all , it only prohibits fans from seeing past posts . Aside from losing some of their 47306 former followers of their first account and 13085 of their second , Wayne was not punished – the fans were . As the petition to restore the original account noted , Instagram was harsher on Wayne than on mainstream celebrities who have posted photos violating their terms of use yet remain active ( i.e . Tyler , the Creator , Nicki Minaj , Chrissy Teigen , Heidi Klum , Miranda Kerr , Rihanna ) .
Wayne sees their account as being more vulnerable to censorship than both accounts with few followers and mega-stars with massive followings . “ You can almost do anything you want if no one follows you , ” they told Stereogum a month after their original account was deleted , “ but if you have a lot of followers , you ca n't really do as much as you want until you get to where you have like a billion followers . The middle class man is always having problems . But yes , if I was like a Rihanna kind of Instagrammer , I could — and even them I mean , you know , in their defense , I think it 's very entertaining . And I love what people say on their comment board . But yeah , I totally understand that . And I think that 's why Instagram is so popular , because it 's safe enough that every 12-year-old who 's got a computer can get on there if they want to . And that 's how you can amass 100 billion followers , and that 's what makes it so powerful and fun ! But it 's got its limits , yeah . So like I said , I knew that I did those , but I had forgotten that if I did too many that got flagged in a row that they might just shut me off . And they did ! But I just started up another one , and they did n't seem to care , so I 'm off and running again . I mean , I would say , I really do like it . And the same reasons that I like Twitter and the whole idea of even text messaging and stuff is that you just can get these little glimpses into what people are doing in their lives . And it just takes a moment . And when I see someone , it 's cool that you 're doing this , and that you stepped on this nail when you were in Wisconsin last week . I mean , just interesting stuff that you 'd never call somebody about . It 's not remarkable , but it is the absolute boring everyday things that is our life . And I love it that way . I really have gotten to know people just from that . ”
So how conservative is Instagram ? It clearly depends on the user . Though they seem to be lenient with several celebrities , they were less so with the experiment tried by Jake Ingalls , Spaceface frontman and Flaming Lips touring member . “ Well , my experiment did something , ” they wrote on facebook on a few days after Wayne 's original boot . “ Posted this on Instagram with the caption ‘ Rebellious Sexedelic Instagram Post ' .. Got a shit ton of likes and then they only removed the picture – not my entire account. ” It seems if they re-posted this several more times however , Instagram would delete their account :
So… Oddly enough , @ waynecoyne got kicked off of Instagram… I ca n't even think of why , But that's… http : //t.co/eTySSf5LKR — SPACEFACE ( @ spacefacemusic ) September 22 , 2013
The uproar over Wayne 's initial account deletion was partly because they had a reputation not just for NSFW pics , but also to be generous on Instagram . Being that they frequently plugged artists they came across or their collaborators , deleting Coyne 's messages wiped the slate of the attention they brought these lesser known artists . This potentially hurts them far more than the ban could impact Wayne , a well-established figure . This is why Jake was among the first to sign the petition to bring back Wayne 's account , writing :
Aside from maybe posting occasional suggestive pictures , Wayne uses this account to help out other struggling artists and musicians by keeping everyone updated on who he 's working with etc . All of their posts come only from a place of love and it makes no sense that you ca n't just remove the one offensive photo , especially if you 've given other artists said privilege . To remove their whole account seems like a move to inhibit a community of artists , rather than slap a man on the wrist .. ”
sign the petition to bring back wayne 's images…http : //t.co/QZwpixdiga @ waynecoyne there 's no place for censorship in a free society . — moby XⓋX ( @ thelittleidiot ) September 23 , 2013
Moby responded to the news of the original ban by tweeting , “ they kicked wayne off of instagram ? wha ? their pictures are amazing , ” then signing the petition with the following message :
there is no place for artistic censorship in a free society . especially when the artist in question is wayne coyne .. bring back wayne 's amazing images .

I love how @ waynecoyne 's only reaction to having their Instagram account locked is `` crap , better make a new one . '' — Andrew Moore ( @ theysayHeyDrew ) September 24 , 2013
Yeah but fuck it… . I juz made a new one @ wayneflaminglip . “ @ LuMoulton : Free @ waynecoyne ! We 're lacking their brilliance # Instagram ” — Wayne Coyne ( @ waynecoyne ) September 25 , 2013
“ I think we all would agree that in lieu of what is considered real , horrible problems in the world , just showing pictures of people without any clothes on seems pretty silly , ” Wayne suggested to MTV News . “ What 's the big deal here ? But that 's the world I live in and a lot of people do n't live in that world . It 's a much more conservative world . ”
UPDATE May 19 at 12:52 p.m. EST : A New York Times report has identified the victim as Mark Carson , 32 , and the suspect as 33-year-old Elliot Morales .
In what may be the latest in a disturbing series of crimes allegedly targeting New York 's gay community , a man was fatally shot in the head May 18 while walking through the West Village .
As NBC is reporting , local law enforcement officials are investigating the case as a hate crime after learning the suspect , who was arrested just blocks from the scene , allegedly hurled a series of anti-gay insults at the 32-year-old victim before shooting him .
Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly told the Associated Press that the suspect referred to the victim , who has been identified in the media only as a Brooklyn resident , and their companion as `` gay wrestlers '' after encountering them on the street shortly after midnight .
The suspect then reportedly shot the victim , who was later pronounced dead at a nearby hospital , in the face .
“ This fully looks to be a hate crime ; a bias crime , ” Kelly is quoted by CBS as saying . “ There were no words that would aggravate the situation that were spoken by the victims . They did not know the confronter . ''
Meanwhile , the New York Post points to another bizarre detail . Roughly 20 minutes before the shooting , a bartender confronted the suspect , who had been caught urinating on the wall of a nearby bar . The suspect is said to have then threatened to shoot the bartender , noting , “ Do you know about the shooting in Sandy Hook ? ”
Among those to decry the shooting was New York mayoral hopeful Christine Quinn , who said they were `` horrified '' to learn of the case on Twitter :
Horrified to learn abt the murder of a gay man in my district after being chased out of a Greenwich Vil rest & assailed by homophobic slurs — Christine C. Quinn ( @ SpeakerQuinn ) May 18 , 2013
Quinn then added :
This kind of shocking and senseless violence , so deeply rooted in hate , has no place in a City whose greatest strength is its diversity — Christine C. Quinn ( @ SpeakerQuinn ) May 18 , 2013
The case follows an alleged attack on another gay man just outside of another popular New York hotspot . ABC 7 reports that the victim , who was not identified , was coming out of the West Village gay bar Pieces when they were attacked by two men who were yelling gay slurs . They were not seriously hurt .
On May 5 , another gay Brooklyn couple was allegedly knocked to the ground by four men emerging from a New York Knicks game at Madison Square Garden . The alleged culprits shouted anti-gay slurs at the pair in broad daylight , according to the report .
GlobalData Says China Will Lead Global Solar Installations In 2015
July 30th , 2015 by Joshua S Hill
In a report published towards the beginning of June , global research and consulting firm GlobalData revealed the results of its latest Global Solar Power Market report , which provided analysis of the global market in 2014 , with forecasts through 2015 . Based on data obtained from multiple sources , including in-house analysis , GlobalData predict that China will stay atop the global solar PV installation pile in 2015 with just over 17.6 GW of solar PV installed in 2015 , an increase of approximately 7 GW over 2014 .
That 17.6 GW makes up a sizeable percentage of the global market that GlobalData is expecting to near 43.8 GW by the end of the year , up from 2014 's 36.4 GW .
Commenting on the figures , GlobalData 's Practice Head for Power , Ankit Mathur , pointed out that China 's cumulative solar PV capacity reached just over 28 GW by the end of 2014 , thanks to 10.6 GW installed that year .
“ For 2015 , the country had previously set a target of making 15 GW of solar PV additions , comprising 7 GW of distributed generation and 8 GW of ground-mounted capacity , ” Mathur continued . “ However , China has revised its annual target to 17.8 GW and is well on track to achieve this goal , given that about 5 GW of solar capacity was installed in Q1 . These additions will allow the country to retain its world-leading status for annual solar PV additions . ”
However , what is interesting is how these figures play with recent doubt cast on the legitimacy of China 's installation figures . Recent figures released by China 's National Energy Administration showed that China had installed 7.73 GW worth of new solar so far this year , but that 9 % of it was left to sit idle due to congestion on the grid . There have been other concerns , such as the quality of the manufacturing for Chinese-made solar products , undermining the significant numbers put forward by Chinese officials when it comes time to display a quarters installation figures .
GlobalData seems to be focusing solely on installation figures , rather than connection to the grid or immediate usage — which is not a ridiculous methodology to take , considering that China 's situation falls into a relatively rare category of oversupply .
Nobu owners Drew Nieporent , Robert De Niro , and Nobu Matsuhisa .
In August 1994 — just two months after an NBA Finals Game had been interrupted by a live broadcast of California police chasing a white Ford Bronco — restaurateur Drew Nieporent , producer Meir Teper , actor Robert De Niro , and chef Nobuyuki Matsuhisa opened Nobu in Tribeca . Twenty-three years later , Matsuhisa has emerged as one of the world 's most successful expansionist chefs , with high-volume restaurants — and now hotels — spread across the globe , as well as the distinction of having inspired hundreds , if not thousands , of nominally Japanese restaurants to combine slices of yellowtail with slivers of jalapeño , and set it to lounge grooves . As then–New York Times critic Ruth Reichl observed in their three-star assessment of the original location in 1995 , “ It has grown into a restaurant that can not be compared to anything else . ”
On Saturday night , the original location closed its doors . It was like any other service : There were perhaps fewer celebs than in the era when Richie Notar was manager , but just as many orders of miso black cod and rock-shrimp tempura flew out of the kitchen . Matsuhisa was traveling , De Niro was working , but Nieporent — dressed in their trademark checkered shirt and Myriad Restaurant Group fleece vest — held court , greeting regulars , sharing remembrances , and getting ready to move to a new location at 195 Broadway .
What initially brought you , Robert De Niro , and Nobu Matsuhisa together ?
Essentially , Robert De Niro had been a customer of Matsuhisa , in Los Angeles . When De Niro and I were going to do Tribeca Grill , Bob brought up Nobu 's name as a potential chef for the project . I knew a little bit about Nobu , because in 1989 , they were named a Best New Chef by Food & Wine , along with Debra Ponzek from Montrachet . Nobu eventually saw the Tribeca Grill space , the size of it , and decided it was too big for him . They said , “ But maybe one day I can open a small sushi bar with you . ”
I saw the friendship , the kinship if you will , between De Niro and Nobu . I made it a point in my head to make that thing happen . Sure enough , a few years later , I found a space down the block . With the help of David Rockwell , we set about building Nobu in 1993 . We opened in August of 1994 .
It was a hit from the start ?
Yeah , it was packed from day one . I had opened Montrachet in 1985 , which was a big hit , then I opened Tribeca Grill in 1990 , which was another big hit . I always wanted to do a lot of places . I felt in my gut that New York did n't have a place like this and needed one , and that we were going to be successful from day one . It felt pretty right . The only fork in the road there was that we did n't have a liquor license at the very beginning , so I used to joke that we were called “ Nobooze . ”
How important would you argue the restaurant , and Nobu himself , have been ?
Honestly , I think Nobu is within the top five of chefs of all time , 23 years and so many restaurants later . It influenced all the chefs . It 's also trans-generational : Our early customers have never left , but they 've passed the baton to their kids , who are now bigger regulars than they are . Because of online reservations , we can keep track of how many visits people have made , and some of them have hit over 250 . It 's startling . It 's not just a handful . It 's the majority of the regulars , for whom it is an important part of their lifestyle .
We had a robbery , so there 's actually a bullet hole in the vestibule . We used to say that we could seat you in a shooting section or the no-shooting section .
I remember we had just opened and Sirio Maccioni was doing an event with Gerard Boyer , Paul Bocuse , and Jacques Maximin . They asked if we could do a table of six . I was working the door . They showed up with 18 people . At the time , Morimoto was working behind the sushi bar . They had done a painstaking menu for six people , so they did n't know what to do when they walked in with 18 . I told them to do the menu for six people , and for the others , I said , “ Do whatever the fuck you want. ” Robin Williams was here that night , too . When the chefs went outside to smoke , they followed them outside , like a kid in a candy store , since they were such a big foodie . I do n't know if they knew who they are .
We opened Rubicon in April of '94 , and Nobu in August of '94 . At the James Beard Awards , in 1995 , they were both nominated for Best New Restaurant . Nobu won . Traci des Jardins won Best New Chef . And Montrachet won for Best Service . We won like five awards that night . It was ridiculous .
The bottom line is , with all these chefs — that was the night Nobu became an international figure , because the French guys had never seen anything like it . There was n't any 50 Best at the time . This was the breakout .
I think the key thing is accommodating people in the manner in which they want to be accommodated . We bend over backwards to have people learn about us or enjoy their experience , whether they have been coming for a long time or are brand-new . Servers do n't have an edge . They 'll ask you if you have been there before , because they want to know if you need guidance . If you do n't want guidance , they 'll leave you alone . The great attribute of Nobu is that it filled an amazing void in New York for that type of food .
What do you mean ?
There are a lot of sushi bars , but they are n't all very friendly . They do n't have the repertoire of Nobu dishes . In the early days , people had their Nobu list of dishes , a set of guidelines for the best way to eat at Nobu . So when their friends wanted to eat at Nobu , they first had to go to these people and ask , “ What do I do when I go ? ” At the beginning , it was a little confusing , since the menu was quite large . I edited at first with “ Nobu Signature Cold Dishes ” and “ Nobu Signature Hot Dishes , ” to give people some clue . The point I 'm trying to make is that customers adopted it as their club , and each of them had their way of navigating it .
When I come to Nobu , I eat the exact same dishes . Most places are about innovation — everything has to be new — but we 've learned that the signature dishes that have been on the menu for many years are what the vast majority of customers want . So when we open the new one , we will have one foot in the new and one in the old . That 's because we know that if we went in a completely different direction , we 'd lose the vast majority of our customers .
Would you say it was also a pioneer in terms of the big-box , clubby , David Rockwell Asian restaurant ?
Yes and no . There was a place Café Seiyoken that tried to do fusion , which I always joked was confusion . The very nature of the Japanese menu is simplicity , and I think Nobu embellished without ever crossing the line . Everyone talks about clean food , and that 's what this is .
We 've been influential to our peers , but also to the diners .
In terms of atmosphere , Rockwell did something that synergized perfectly with what we were doing , which was new to everyone , even the partners . We had n't experienced ponzu , yuzu , and many of these flavors . It was fun and comfortable and easy .
Give me some Drew-style stories from the early days .
We were a little snakebitten at the beginning . We had a robbery , so there 's actually a bullet hole in the vestibule . We used to say that we could seat you in a shooting section or the no-shooting section . I was watching a program on TV about arson and realized that the building I was watching was our building , since apparently the super had tried to set fire to the building at one point . We had someone get hit by a car out front . One of our staff members had a heart attack . We were racing , but there were some scary moments .
The great thing is the diversity of this staff : If there was ever a moment here … you look at the people who work here , and it 's the story of immigration . Every nationality , quintessential New York . That 's the success . The Japanese restaurants in New York were all-Japanese staff , and the customers were all Japanese , pretty much , so what Nobu did alone was crucial — their friendliness and desire to serve everyone .
For me , every accomplished person seems to have gone through the portal of Nobu . Everybody knows what it is . I have other restaurants , and even 27 years after Tribeca Grill , not everyone knows what it is . You say Nobu , and everybody knows . We 've had Paul Simon and Lionel Richie perform . Adele comes in for takeout . Beyoncé loves it . Taylor Swift has an apartment around the corner . Even though it 's a celebrity magnet , we protect people 's privacy . The food is also a pretty healthy way to eat .
Seventeen years ago , Muhammad Ali comes in . Howard Bingham , their photographer , was with them and introduced them to me . Ali had Parkinson 's and could n't really say anything . They were shaking . They sit down , pulls a napkin off the table , pulls out a Sharpie , and starts scribbling like crazy . It was almost uncomfortable . I gave Howard a weird look . Then Ali flips the napkin over and keeps scribbling on the other side . Then I got even more uncomfortable . What ensued was that they sat for 30 minutes , and on both sides , they had drawn mountain ranges , a boat , a plume of smoke , amazing . They signed it and gave it to me as a gift .
I also remember that before we opened , this was a place called Café Americano . They used to sell drugs out of this place . It was nefarious here . When I took the place over , I decided , I ca n't have these guys coming back — the wise guys . I 'll never forget this as long as I live : We only had room for a sushi bar , not a liquor bar , and David Rockwell wanted to put it all the way in the back , and I said , “ No , I want to put it in between the two pillars , so people see it when they walk in. ” I swear to God , we open the doors on opening night , and the first customers are the wise guys : “ Where 's the bar ? We wan na have a drink. ” I tell them , “ I 'm really sorry , we do n't have a liquor bar. ” The wise guy goes , “ How the fuck do you not have a bar ? ” I swear to God , they never came back . Not putting a liquor bar in here was the most important thing I ever did .
How did Nobu — a chef so resistant to opening in New York , who said Tribeca Grill was too big — become one of the most successful expansionist chefs ? They seem to be able to open three spots at a time .
At the beginning , Nobu would always admonish me about being involved in too many endeavors , “ With sushi , man is man , and not a machine. ” The London opening [ in 1998 ] was the breakthrough . Once we saw we could be successful in a new market like that — let 's face it , getting on a plane is not easy , but Nobu 's children were getting older , and that project built the dam to do other things .
Did they have a knack for expansion instantly ?
The thing is , at the beginning , it was very hard to get sushi staff . They did n't really want to work for a non-Japanese owner . But we realized that there were people from other ethnicities who wanted to learn the craft , be it Korean or Hispanic . And there 's nothing like making money in a job . When people make money in a job , not only are they going to keep working for you , but when you expand , they get rewarded . Pretty much , every time there was an opportunity , we could look inward for inventory . That was what gave us the confidence to expand .
You 're closing the original location because the rent got too high ?
We 've been there 23 years , and the rent has accelerated quite a bit . I have customers who pay money to us , so I understand that without those people , I ca n't be in business . For some reason , the tenant-landlord relationship is different . It 's like we pay all that money and are treated like the scum on someone 's shoe . I just do n't understand it . But I think our time had come . The building was fair to us , more or less , but it was n't like at the end they said , “ We really do n't want to lose you . ”
You know , whether I wanted to stay or not , we are looking forward to the new one . We have greater facilities to do what we need to do . The volume of business was almost always too much for the design of the kitchen . On a busy night , we are going to do 300 people , and you can only fit six people on the hot line . The benefit is the sushi bar , which is like a second kitchen . I see it as an enormous garde-manger section . The reason we took Next Door is because it let us enlarge the kitchen . So the big factor to move is that the physical space will help us modernize and keep up with the volume .
Are you the type that gets nostalgic and sad , or are you ready to push forward ?
I hate change . I 've never liked it . It took me a long time to understand change . I could n't premeditate how I was going to feel about leaving or how I was going to feel about the new space . I just wanted to let it happen and not overthink it . I really had a good time this last week with everyone . Normally , when you close a restaurant , the morale is just horrible . This is a unique situation or me : You 're closing a restaurant and the entire staff is moving to a new place . In fact , everyone was pretty upbeat . They share the love of that space , since many of them have been there from day one .
It did n't impact me the way I thought it would . I have a philosophy that space is like a person : You have a pretty good sense of whether you will like that person the moment you meet them . The first reaction is telling . The Tribeca space was always friendly — high ceilings , big windows , laid out correctly with a kitchen in the middle , so it did n't feel like a bowling alley . There was a lot of intelligence in the design of that space , so it was n't easy to let go .
The saving grace is that we have this new space . We 're turning the page . We respect the 23 years we had in the space , but we have an opportunity to keep the story going , vibrant , and interesting .

About
The Challenge : Drive from Key West , Florida to Prudhoe Bay , Alaska in 110 hours .
The Goal : Witness the last arctic sunset of 2011 .
Inspired by almost a decade of watching the British motoring show , `` Top Gear , '' the 110 Hours team has planned a driving route that only the least sane people in the world would take - From Mile 0 in Key West , Florida , to the north end of the Pan-American Highway System in Prudhoe Bay , Alaska . That 's a distance of 5500 miles ; to complete it in 110 hours means averaging 50 MPH for over four straight days . No hotels , no sit-down restaurants , no joke .
The trip , scheduled to take place in late November 2011 , will take David , their friend and co-driver , and a group of friends as support and film crew from the perpetual warm sun and sandy beaches of the Florida Keys to about 200 miles inside the Arctic Circle . We will be racing the clock , attempting to arrive in Prudhoe Bay in time to see the final sunrise and sunset of the season on November 24th . The sun will rise over the icy tundra shortly after 6 AM local time , and they will set again about an hour later - not to be seen again for another 2 months . The final stretch of the trip , a perilous 400 miles , will take place on Alaska 11 , the infamous Dalton Highway often featured on the History Channel 's show Ice Road Truckers . At the end of the trip , we will be at the Prudhoe Bay Oil Field , the largest oil field on the North American continent and responsible for two-thirds of a million barrels of oil per day .
Along the way , we will expect to encounter and handle a wide variety of experiences and problems related to weather and terrain as well as the psychological and physical challenges of a 5500 mile nonstop endurance drive . Dense city traffic , increasingly severe winter weather as we proceed north , curvy mountain roads and mind-numbingly straight , flat , empty roads through the plains and tundra of the midwest and Canada .
Your contribution will be used to purchase fuel , food and other supplies , not only for the drivers , but the production crew that will be accompanying them in a second car . We estimate that almost $ 1500 will be spent on fuel alone - and that 's just one way . The money will also be used to purchase or rent necessary electronics , such as additional production equipment , navigation systems and other things we would n't want to be stuck at the side of a highway 200 miles from civilization in Alaska in winter without .

Bert Cooper ( Robert Morse ) does a song-and-dance number from beyond the grave in a Season 7 episode of 'Mad Men . ' ( Photo : Justina Mintz , AMC )
On July 19 , 2007 , viewers met the cocktail-sipping movers and shakers of Madison Avenue in Mad Men , Matthew Weiner 's slow-burning , spellbinding view of 1960s New York , as seen through the eyes of advertising anti-hero Don Draper ( Jon Hamm ) . The landmark show picked up 16 Emmy Awards , including three for best drama , throughout its stellar seven-season run , making stars of Hamm and Elisabeth Moss and putting AMC on the map as a formidable cable network .
Ten years later , we look back at our favorite episodes .
10 . 'Shoot ' ( Season 1 , Episode 9 )
Weiner was n't kind to January Jones in later years — their `` Fat Betty '' arc in Season 5 is unquestionably Mad Men 's most egregious story line — nor were critics too complimentary about their acting abilities . But this first-season episode is an impressive reminder of just how good Jones can be with the right material , offering a glimpse into Betty 's once-promising career as a model and the pressure , particularly from their mother , that they felt to settle into the role of an acquiescent housewife . The final shot of an indignant Mrs. Draper picking off pigeons with a BB gun remains one of the series ' most iconic moments .
9 . 'The Doorway ' ( Season 6 , Episodes 1 & 2 )
Fans were left scratching their heads when Don proposed to Megan ( Jessica Paré ) in Season 4 's startling `` Tomorrowland , '' and their conflicts about their acting aspirations grew tedious in Season 5 . But this sixth-season opener shows the allure of the new Mrs. Draper — a vivacious , freshly minted soap star who 's recognized by fans during their Hawaiian getaway — while also exploring Don 's fear of death , as they witness their doorman suffer a heart attack and attends the funeral of Roger 's ( John Slattery ) mom . It 's no coincidence that their beachside read is Dante 's Inferno , which comes full circle in the Season 6 finale as Don revisits their personal hell : the dilapidated whorehouse where they grew up .
8 . 'Guy Walks into an Advertising Agency ' ( Season 3 , Episode 6 )
Mad Men 's most darkly comedic episode will always be remembered for its blood-spattered office party , in which a drunken secretary riding a John Deere lawnmower severs the foot of London account executive Guy MacKendrick ( Jamie Thomas King ) before smashing into a glass wall . But it 's Peggy 's ( Moss ) moving exchange with Joan ( Christina Hendricks ) that makes the hour , as they find the words to thank the departing secretary for their sage advice and inspiration as a subtly powerful force in the workplace .
7 . 'Meditations in an Emergency ' ( Season 2 , Episode 13 )
The miracle of life is anything but in Mad Men , which surprised Peggy in Season 1 with a baby they put up for adoption . They eventually tell the child 's father , Pete ( Vincent Kartheiser ) , about it in an uncomfortable encounter after they confess their love . `` I could have shamed you into being with me , but I did n't want to , '' they admit . `` I wanted other things . '' The episode also opens with another unexpected pregnancy , as Betty learns they have a third child on the way after Don confesses to adultery . Them desire for an abortion and the stigma surrounding it from their doctor and friend — who unconvincingly console them that it 's a blessing in disguise — is devastating .
6 . 'The Gypsy and the Hobo ' ( Season 3 , Episode 11 )
Dick Whitman could n't stay dead for long . After learning about Don 's real name in Season 1 's `` Nixon vs. Kennedy '' — which flashes back to the Korean War and theirs stealing the identity of Draper , a fallen soldier — Betty finally discovers their hidden past and confronts him . In a rare emotional moment , Don lets down their guard and tearfully confesses everything about their troubled childhood and dead brother , as Betty charily but sympathetically tries to offer comfort . It 's some of the show 's finest acting from both Hamm and Jones .
5 . 'The Strategy ' ( Season 7 , Episode 6 )
Midseason finale `` Waterloo '' is among Mad Men 's most adventurous hours , ending with a fantastical song-and-dance number by a now-deceased Bert Cooper ( Robert Morse ) and a flock of secretaries . But the previous episode , `` The Strategy , '' packs a bigger emotional punch , as Peggy leads the charge on the family-centered Burger Chef campaign . In a boozy late-night brainstorming session , Don and Peggy hash out a campaign that turns into a frank rumination on family dynamics , aging and loneliness . What should be an eye-rolling slow dance to Frank Sinatra 's My Way is an unexpectedly tear-jerking culmination of their complex relationship .
4 . 'The Arrangements ' ( Season 3 , Episode 4 )
It 's been hailed as Mad Men 's quintessential episode , and for good reason . This hour offers a little bit of everything we love about the drama : humor , as Peggy tries on a flirty , fun-loving persona in their quest for a new roommate ; nostalgia , as Sal ( Bryan Batt ) pays homage to Bye Bye Birdie in their failed Patio cola campaign ( and unwittingly outs themselves as gay to their wife ) ; and death , as Sally 's ( Kiernan Shipka ) child's-eye view of life is shattered by the unexpected passing of their grandpa Gene ( Ryan Cutrona ) . Their dangerous driving lessons were only the beginning of Sally 's recalcitrant chain-smoking years .
3 . 'The Other Woman ' ( Season 5 , Episode 11 )
Mad Men has deftly tackled gender politics , but never better than in this fifth-season episode , which hinges on an executive 's piggish proposition to sleep with Joan or risk the agency 's loss of the Jaguar account . Joan 's empowered but painful decision to spend the night for a lucrative paycheck — and too-late tip from Don that not all male partners approved the compromise — is heartbreaking . Later , Peggy anxiously tells Don that they are moving to another agency , and triumphantly smiles as they walk out the door to The Kinks ' You Really Got Me .
2 . 'The Suitcase ' ( Season 4 , Episode 7 )
This episode almost exclusively features Peggy and Don , who keeps them at the office on their birthday to chew over the looming Samsonite luggage campaign pitch , much to the frustration of their meddling mother and boyfriend . An argument over Peggy 's contributions eventually leads to whiskey-laden laughs and intimate dinner conversation , during which they make personal confessions and deepen their bond . The emotional crux comes early the next morning , when Don finally works up the courage to call their `` niece , '' Stephanie ( Caity Lotz ) , whom he 'd been avoiding , to hear the inevitable news that the widowed Anna Draper ( Melinda Page Hamilton ) died of cancer . Don breaks down and cries over losing the last piece of their former life , and Peggy attempts to comfort their stoic , tormented mentor at their most vulnerable .
1 . 'The Wheel ' ( Season 1 , Episode 13 )
Mad Men 's very best episode is set on Thanksgiving , when Betty wrangles with Don over their refusal to go to their family 's house for the holiday and anguishes over their suspected cheating . Don , too , takes stock of their family and infidelity as they pitch a campaign for Kodak 's Carousel projector , flipping through photos of their newborn children and wedding , musing about the passage of time and nostalgia . `` It goes backwards and forwards , '' they say in the sentimental spiel . `` It takes us to a place where we ache to go again . '' The episode ends as Don imagines coming home to Betty and their kids , delighted that he 's agreed to spend Thanksgiving with them , but instead they return to an empty house . Capping off the show 's first season , `` The Wheel '' solidified Mad Men 's status as not only a `` Peak TV '' game-changer but an all-time masterpiece .

OSLO ( Reuters ) - About 100 fighter jets from the United States and eight European nations began an Arctic training exercise in the Nordic nations on Monday , a region worried by increased Russian military activity .
The exercise , based in the north of Norway , Sweden and Finland with 4,000 personnel , is meant to test cooperation among Arctic nations near Russia . It was planned before Moscow 's annexation of Ukraine 's Crimea region last year raised regional tensions .
“ The aim is to exercise and train units in the orchestration and conduct of complex air operations , in close relations to NATO partners , ” Norwegian brigadier general Jan Ove Rygg , heading the exercise , said in a statement .
The exercise , lasting from May 25 to June 5 , is one of the biggest fighter jet exercises in Europe this year and the second of its type after one in 2013 . Plans are for exercises every second year , testing everything from shooting down airborne targets to mid-air refueling .
NATO members involved were the United States , Germany , Britain , France , the Netherlands and Norway , as well as non-members Sweden , Finland and Switzerland , which are linked to the alliance via NATO 's partnership for peace .
Russia has stepped up military activity around the Nordic and Baltic region . Incursions into airspace have especially rattled the Baltic states and Sweden last year hunted in vain for a suspected submarine in its waters .
Citi : Renewables and energy efficiency will reduce planet 's energy bill by $ 1.8trn
Switching to a low-carbon energy system immediately could save the planet $ 1.8trn by 2040 , global investment bank Citi has claimed .
The bank this week released a report , Energy Darwinism II : Why a Low Carbon Future Does n't Have to Cost the Earth , comparing a business-as-usual scenario to one where the planet invests heavily in renewables and energy efficiency in the short-term .
The total spend on energy over the next 25 years is found to be “ remarkably similar ” in both scenarios with the ‘ Action ' scenario implying a total spend of $ 190.2trn compared to $ 192trn for inaction .
In the greener scenario , the initial spend on renewables and efficiency is gradually paid for over time . Citi suggests that the cost of this initial action will only be an extra 0.1 % of global GDP .
Climate chaos
As well as the potential savings , the report describes the liabilities of not acting as “ equally vast ” .
The cumulative 'lost ' GDP from the impacts of climate change could be around $ 44trn by 2060 , the report claims .
“ We are not climate scientists , nor are we trying to take sides in the global warming debate , ” said the report introduction .
“ Rather we are trying to take an objective look at the economics of the discussion , to assess the incremental costs and impacts of mitigating the effects of emissions , to see if there is a 'solution ' which offers global opportunities without penalizing global growth , whether we can afford it ( or indeed we can afford not to ) , and how we could make it happen .
“ We believe that that solution does exist . The incremental costs of following a low carbon path are in context limited and seem affordable , the 'return ' on that investment is acceptable and moreover the likely avoided liabilities are enormous . Given that all things being equal cleaner air has to be preferable to pollution , a very strong `` Why would you not ? '' argument begins to develop . ''
Revolution
These changes envisioned by Citi would also have a profound impact on the global energy mix , with more than 80 % of coal reserves having to remain unused , as well as half of gas reserves and a third of oil reserves .
“ At current prices , around $ 100trn of assets could be 'carbon stranded ' ” , said the bank .
Having outlined this vision of transformative change in the global energy market , the report questions how it is possible to mobilise the investment needed in the short term .
“ There is a clear need for the investment , balanced by enormous investor appetite for these types of investments ; the missing link has been the lack of , and quality of , the investment vehicles available ”
The report suggests : “ Financial markets must innovate to facilitate investment via the creation of new instruments , vehicles and markets… ... We see the greatest opportunity in the credit markets ” .
Earlier this year , Citi itself announced a landmark 10-year $ 100bn commitment to finance activities that reduce carbon emissions , help communities adapt to climate change and directly finance sustainable infrastructure such as green housing .

Members of the plane 's crew escort the body of the slain passenger out of an ambulance in Peshawar
A woman was killed and three crew members were injured when gunmen opened fire on a passenger plane as it landed at Pakistan 's Peshawar airport .
The Pakistan International Airlines plane was carrying 178 passengers travelling from Saudi Arabia when it came under attack as it was preparing to land , police officer Asghar Khan said at the airport .
The plane was hit by six bullets , killing a Pakistani woman and injuring three crew members , police said .
The woman 's daughter was sitting next to them when they were shot in the head , PIA official Mohammad Kifayatullah Khan said .
`` When I went inside the plane , I saw the woman lying on the seat and their nine-year-old daughter was crying , 'My mother is dead , my mother is dead ' , '' Mr Khan said .
`` All the passengers were panicked . Some of them wanted to get out as soon as possible because they were afraid of fire inside the plane .
`` The captain of the plane had narrowly escaped , '' they said . `` It would have been a disaster had they been hit . ''
At least one bullet struck the plane 's engine , police said .
The attack came after the Pakistan military launched a major offensive on June 16 in the dangerous tribal district of North Waziristan along the Afghan border , where Taliban and Al Qaeda-linked militants had taken refuge .
Pakistani jets have pounded suspected militant hideouts and the Taliban have vowed to hit back .
Pakistan has promised to tighten security at airports and other potential targets , but critics say decades of neglect of Pakistan 's police force has left citizens vulnerable .
On June 8 , 10 Taliban gunmen attacked the airport in the southern port city of Karachi . Thirty-four people were killed in the five-hour gun battle .
The Taliban attacked an academy for the security forces at the airport two days later .
On Monday , the government was forced to divert a plane carrying prominent cleric Tahirul Qadri after violence broke out on the ground in Islamabad , with hundreds of supporters armed with sticks battling police .
The authorities , fearing an escalation of unrest , diverted the plane to the eastern city of Lahore .
In 2012 a Taliban suicide squad staged a deadly attack on Peshawar 's Bacha Khan International Airport that left nine people dead , including five attackers .

I do n't know what percentage of bikes in the Netherlands operate with coaster brakes , but it must certainly be a sizeable proportion , perhaps even a majority . The tell-tale sign is handlebars free from brake levers ( or those with just one brake lever , for the front wheel ) , and in Dutch towns and cities , these kinds of bikes are ubiquitous .
By contrast , the number of bikes in the UK with coaster brakes must be a tiny , tiny minority of the overall total . My omafiets is one of those bikes .
I 'd never ridden a bicycle with a coaster before , so I was quite nervous about how it would work out for me , and hesitated about whether I should opt for a more familiar lever-operated brake . But having lived with it for a few years , there 's absolutely no way I would have a different kind of brake for my rear wheel . It 's brilliant .
The front ( drum ) brake is lever operated , so I am UK-legal , in that I have two independent braking systems , one for each wheel . But in all honesty it 's not really necessary – the vast majority of the stopping power comes from the coaster at the rear . It 's an effective brake , particularly because on this kind of bike , your body weight is almost entirely over the rear wheel . The front brake is merely a nice extra .
The coaster brake is a back pedal brake – to slow down , you merely apply downward pressure on the pedals , in precisely the same way you apply downward pressure on a brake pedal in a car . In fact , that 's the closest analogy to the action of a coaster brake – slight downward pressure , slight braking ; more downward pressure , stronger braking ; stamping down on the pedal , well , your wheel is going to lock up .
I think it 's that association with braking in a car that makes a coaster brake actually quite intuitive . Braking with your feet quickly becomes natural – it took only a week or so for a complete novice like me to become accustomed to it . I now often find myself absentmindedly pushing down on the pedals to brake on my other ( coaster-free ) bikes , simply because that 's now a natural movement for me . ( Meeting no resistance whatsoever , my brain instantly transfers the message to my hands instead ! )
That ‘ naturalness ' is just one advantage of the coaster brake . An important other advantage is that it leaves your hands free for other things , particularly signalling . As signalling with your hands is often needed when you are simultaneously slowing down , to turn off of , or onto , a road at junction , it 's so much more convenient and easy to have your feet doing the braking , rather than having to transfer your hands from the brake levers to a ‘ signal ' position , and then back again , or compromising by braking with just one brake , while signalling with the other hand .
Another major advantage is maintenance . Because a coaster brake is effectively operated by the chain , which is already part of the bike , that means there 's no need for ‘ extra ' cabling or levers . The bike is neater , and tidier , with no braking system to maintain in addition to the transmission ( which in any case is protected from the elements ) .
On the downside ( for me at least ) , with a coaster brake your pedals ca n't be rotated backwards – at least only for a little bit , before the brake fully applies . That means when you stop , it 's helpful to ensure that your pedals are in a position ready for you to go again . You ca n't ‘ kick ' them backwards to get them back into position .
In practice , this quickly becomes very natural ; my technique is shown in the video below .
The most powerful braking position is with the pedals at 3 o'clock/9 o'clock ; and that 's pretty much an easy position for you to start off again .
If , by chance , your pedals are n't in a great position to set off again , the best thing to do is to roll your bike back a foot or so , returning the pedal to a position where force can be applied . Or ( as I sometimes do ) just push off and use your momentum to start pedalling again . It 's no big deal .
It also helps to have your saddle low enough so your feet ( or at least your standing foot ) can reach the ground with you sat on it , as in the picture above . That means you are not forced to apply weight to the pedals when you come to a stop , which is tricky when that 's your braking system .
With this kind of bike , a low saddle just feels comfortable and natural in any case – just look at the relaxed chap in the first picture in this post – so any notion of raising it to an allegedly ‘ optimal ' height for power transfer does n't really fit . Bikes like these are for comfortable cruising , not hard acceleration , or performance .
The only other downside to a coaster that I 'm aware of is that – in the event of an emergency – your pedals may not be instantaneously in the right position to apply the best available braking power ( unlike brake levers on your handlebars ) . They may be at the top , or the bottom , of the pedal stroke , where not many backwards force can be applied .
Whether this is a major factor or not , I do n't know – I have always been able to stop fairly sharply on the few occasions I 've had to . Perhaps this is because ( by risk compensation ) I ride more slowly , and more carefully , more aware of what idiots might do , simply because I have to react in a slightly different way . Typically if I pick up speed , or I approach a situation where I may have stop , my pedals ‘ rest ' in the best position for stopping , parallel to the ground . I rarely find myself pedalling hard into a situation where there is uncertainty . Maybe I 'm just older and wiser !
But overall I find that the braking system just fits with this type of bike – it 's easy , painless , instinctive , and it works effectively . If I had to get another omafiets I would choose a coaster brake without hesitation .

Artist : Sir Richard Bishop Album : Intermezzo Label : Editions Mego Review date : Jul . 2 , 2012
A title like Intermezzo suggests that this album by former Sun City Girl guitarist Sir Richard Bishop could be considered as little more than an interlude between two more worthwhile releases . Don�t be fooled : If anything , Intermezzo is a compendium and concentration of the myriad facets of Bishop�s remarkable talents , a Bishop album in excelsis . Musically , Bishop is very much a magpie , flitting from genre to genre , continent to continent with ease and enthusiasm . �Dust and Spurs� is a feisty acoustic blast that dances across the Middle East with an occasional nod toward Appalachia , its frenetic notes and clear tone showcasing Bishop�s impressive control and virtuosity , all within the tight confines of just over two minutes . In comparison , �Reversionary Tactics� is traversed by echoes of obscure American great Sandy Bull , with Bishop sliding notes that seem to dance and sway in the ether out of a reverberating electric guitar , again for a tantalizingly brief period . Also clocking in at just over two minutes is �Dance of the Cedars , � beamed in straight from North Africa and with a similar starry-eyed earnestness to the music of Agitation Free�s Malesch album , only much more sparse . Intermezzos indeed , these tracks feel like sketches , the kind of quick exercises Bishop might chuck out to relieve the intensity of a live show ( and indeed , Ideologic Organ�s Stephen O�Malley references the intensity and charm of Bishop�s live shows in the album�s liner notes ) . Yet , there is nothing of the throwaway about any of them , with �Dance of the Cedars� benefiting from some measured studio embellishments , and all three carrying their creator�s verve across to the listener . Bishop really adds meat to Intermezzo�s bones with the Robbie Basho-esque epic �Inner Redoubt , � on which they patiently twist open-ended acoustic guitar solos around one another , creating an elegiac haze of balmy , elegant folk . Again , it�s hard not to marvel at Bishop�s dexterity , but on this track more than any of the others , it�s the emotional resonance of the composition that stands out . And , just as effectively , they can change tacks abruptly and embark on a jaunty jig in the form of �Haunt Tulip , � with its hints of Django Reinhardt and upbeat tempo . Meanwhile , �Dhumavati� and �Khajuraho� both carry debts to the raga style Bishop explored so ecstatically on 2007�s While my Guitar Violently Bleeds , resonating deeply with the spiritual mysticism of a Ravi Shankar or a Pandit Pran Nath . Where they need to take their time , Bishop will linger over notes and effects . Conversely , they can fire off notes at breakneck speed with casual insouciance . Sometimes these tracks evoke the �sketch� approach of The Durutti Column�s Vini Reilly , at others they carry the weight and sophistication of an Indian sitar master . It may feel like a compilation , or a showcase , but Intermezzo is never incoherent or disjointed . In fact , it feels like we are in the privileged position of witnessing a great guitarist running ideas out of their head and onto their fretboard .

NASHVILLE , Tenn. -- A woman is charged with stealing a senior citizen 's iPad at Skyline Hospital who got caught on surveillance camera twerking in celebration .
Metro police say Porcha White is one of the thieves who stole from Norma Green , a woman caring for their sick husband .
Many who saw our story wanted to do something to help . We had multiple people contact us wanting to donate an iPad to Green . The generosity made them day .
Twerking thieves did not get the best of them
`` Are you twerpin ? '' they asked .
She 's still not too familiar with 'twerking ' but they do understand generosity .
`` He brought me an iPad air , '' said Green .
Green says a manager at Skyline Hospital gave them an iPad after thieves stole theirs in a hospital waiting room .
Green 's dedication to sit by their husband 's side , for now 26 days , in the hospital moved viewers .
`` It touched my heart and the way that they said ' I do n't care . I 'm here for my husband , the one that I love ' , '' Malvina Dye , a judicial commissioner in Wilson County . `` I thought about it and I thought 'We 've got to do something ! ''
`` IT kind of chokes me up , '' said Green .
`` I just hope that she 'll be able to use them , '' said Dye .
`` She had it laying around the house and they said they did n't need it , '' said Reporter Sabrina Hall . `` She 's got you a phone , a tablet and ear phones that you can use and a case . ''
`` Thank you very much , '' said Green . `` I want to thank them too . ''
While police have identified all four people who rummaged through Green 's bag in the hospital waiting room , even charging one woman so far with theft , Green 's thoughts are elsewhere . They are still with their husband recovering from vascular surgery .
`` Thank you everybody for caring and caring for my husband , '' said Green .
Today is Green 's birthday . They turn 72 years old . They say their husband will soon be out of critical care and heading to rehab .
The symbol of the Grand Old Party is the mighty elephant , a representation of strength and wisdom . But that flattering imagery is not why the pachyderm is the party 's icon . No , that came about as a result of a satirical political cartoon drawn by Thomas Nast in 1874 in Harper 's Weekly in which a donkey ( which Nast earlier had associated with Democrats ) was dressed in a lion 's skin , frightening all the other animals in a zoo . One of the scattering animals was an elephant , which Nast labeled `` the Republican Vote . '' Nast was disillusioned with corruption in the GOP and felt the Party was in decline under President Hayes . They may have used the elephant because Lincoln , the first Republican president , used the image of an elephant in some of their campaign material . As a consequence , by 1872 the elephant was at least sometimes associated with the Party . Nast 's cartoon sealed the deal and forever thereafter the elephant came to represent the GOP .
As an historic aside , and one completely unrelated to the point of this blog , Nast was disappointed in Hayes , who suffered from problems of legitimacy . Hayes lost the popular vote to Democrat Samuel J. Tilden . Nor did they have enough Electoral College votes to be elected . They assumed office only after a congressional commission awarded them 20 disputed electoral votes . At least that election was decided by elected officials and not the Supreme Court .
Elephants are known for their long memories , so only with great irony does the GOP demonstrate colossal forgetfulness . So let us help by recalling past events and Republican claims about Obama .
During the campaign and for the duration of their presidency , the GOP has tarnished Obama with the label of socialist . With their big spending ways they would drive the U.S. economy into the ground , crushed by an enormous debt . The stock market would crash in fear of their socialist policies . Do n't remember ? Here is a reminder ( keeping in mind that Obama took office in January 2009 ) :
`` Obama Bear Market Punishes Investors as Dow Slumps . '' In this article the author claims , `` President Barack Obama now has the distinction of presiding over their own bear market . '' Bloomberg.com ( March 6 , 2009 )
`` Obama 's Radicalism is Killing the Dow . '' Author Michael Boskin prognosticates that , `` It 's hard not to see the continued sell-off on Wall Street and the growing fear on Main Street as a product , at least in part , of the realization that our new president 's policies are designed to radically re-engineer the market-based U.S. economy , not just mitigate the recession and financial crisis . '' Wall Street Journal ( March 6 , 2009 )
Perhaps most astonishing of all , John Tanny of Real Clear Markets , wrote on November 25 , 2008 , an article entitled , `` This Is Obama 's Market , Good and Bad . '' Obama was not yet president ! That did not stop Tanny from writing that , `` Lacking clarity , investors can only guess about what 's ahead based on Obama 's decidedly anti-business rhetoric used during the campaign . Whatever direction they take , it should be clear that today 's stock market is the Obama stock market , so it 's up to them to decide its basic direction . '' Even though Obama was not yet president .
They were not the only one . Rush Limbaugh on November 6 , 2008 , claimed that `` The Obama recession is in full swing , ladies and gentlemen . Stocks are dying , which is a precursor of things to come . This is an Obama recession . '' They actually blamed the state of the economy in long decline , at the time losing 700,000 jobs per month , on a president elected just a few days earlier .
When George W. Bush left the Oval Office on January 20 , 2009 , the Dow was at 7,949 , a decline of 25 percent over the eight years Bush was president . By March the DJIA had completed its tumble to bottom out with a 12-year low at just over 6500 . Now let us look at the headline from May 1 , 2012 , well into Obama 's fourth year in office :
U.S. Stocks-Dow hits more than 4-year high . On that day here is what the Wall Street Journal had to say : `` The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 65.69 points to 13279.32 , closing at its highest level in more than four years . With the day 's gains , the blue-chip benchmark is now just 6.2 percent from the all-time high it reached in October 2007 . ''
What ? How can that be ? The GOP claimed with confident fury that Obama 's radicalism is killing the Dow . That Obama 's bear market punishes investors as Dows slumps . Remember ? Cat got your tongue ? The elephant has become forgetful ? How else to explain the roaring sound of silence from the far right as Obama ends their first term with the Dow reaching historic highs ? I guess this really is Obama 's market `` good and bad '' as Tanny absurdly claimed even before Obama took office . What does Limbaugh have to say about this ? Nothing . Nothing but silence from that quarter . Note that Bloomberg.com has not come out to revise its earlier estimate ; nor has Real Clear Markets adjusted its projections . Just silence , forgetful silence , in the face of overwhelming evidence of Obama 's success . They must be silent , because the far right can hardly claim Obama gets no credit when they so willingly blamed them for an economic decline within days of being elected . Silence is their only refuge from the facts .
The glaring lack of contrition by the far right in the face of being so wrong has the sickly sweet smell of pathological hypocrisy . We are sensing the rotting decay of a party bankrupt by ideological extremism in which facts and reality no longer have any more validity than fantasy and falsehood . Their mantra has been reduced to : blame Obama for all things bad but give no credit for anything good , no matter how that might conflict with rational thought . Unfortunately for the GOP the human brain has the ability to remember past events , and with the miracle of modern technology we can record with great fidelity all that the GOP has claimed . Reality does not threat them well .
But the stock market is only one indication of the disastrous economic policies of a socialist president bent on financial ruin . Perhaps the GOP claim that Obama is destroying the economy can be seen elsewhere . Newsweek in the May 7 issue excerpts salient figures from a forthcoming book by Daniel Gross demonstrating the strength of the American economy . Here are just a few of the facts about how the economy has fared under Obama :
• U.S. exports in2011 are up 34 percent from 2009 to $ 2.1 trillion
• The private sector has created 4.05 million jobs since February 2010 ( 1.4 million jobs were lost during the last two months of the Bush presidency )
• The S & P 500 has increased 104 percent since March 2009 ( the market declined 25 percent in Bush 's eight years )
• Foreign direct investment rose to $ 194.5 billion in 2010 , up from $ 135 billion in 2009
• The U.S. economy is now growing at an annual rate of 3 percent , more rapidly than any other developed country
The expansion of the U.S. economy began in July 2009 , about seven months into Obama 's presidency . Surely , since according to the far right Obama was to blame for the declining economy prior to taking office ( `` The Obama recession is in full swing ... `` ) , they must also then be credited with the growing economy seven months after taking office . No amount of twisted logic and ideological contortion can get around that conundrum for a party so consumed by hatred for the president . If their success is due to policies put in place by their predecessor , then they would have inherited a growing economy , not one on the verge of complete collapse . If a Republican Congress is responsible , that same body would have put in place the appropriate laws when their party also had the White House . Instead they presided over policies leading to economic ruin . No , since they boxed themselves in with their absurd claims that Obama owned the recession they inherited they have nowhere to go four years later in an economy fueled by a near-record high stock market , growing job creation , increased exports and expanding foreign investments . This is Obama 's market , and folks , the Obama recovery is in full swing . But you 'll never hear those words from Limbaugh or their sulking colleagues .
What is good for America and American workers is bad for the GOP , so the far right will ignore the recovery and try to distract us from our growing prosperity with divisive social issues and foreign policy scare tactics . But even there the GOP 's hands are tied . Remember that we were told only Bush could keep us safe from terrorists because there `` have been no terrorist attacks on U.S. soil under Bush 's watch . '' That claim of course ignored the obvious that 9/11 happened under Bush 's watch . To revise that little oversight , Rudy Giuliani said , `` I usually say we had no domestic attacks , no major domestic attack under President Bush since September 11 . '' But in any case , notice that the same argument is no longer being used by the GOP since in fact there has been no terrorist attack on U.S. soil under President Obama . Obama , not Bush , killed bin Laden . By their own logic , should we not then reelect Obama because they have proven they can keep us safe ? The elephant has forgotten again .
Sixty years ago , American women began heading off to the workplace in droves . But in the last couple of decades , that trend has completely stalled out .
`` It seems that we are stuck , '' said Cornell University economist Francine Blau , who co-authored a paper on this topic with their husband Lawrence Kahn , also a Cornell economist .
Sweden 's generous parental leave policies are a key reason why more women choose to work . Malin Lindahl of Sweden will take more than a year of maternity leave after having their first child , Emil , last October .
What went wrong ?
They point to a lack of family-friendly labor laws in the United States as a key part of the problem .
Why the U.S. is trailing
In 1950 , only 37 % of women ages 25-54 participated in the labor force -- meaning they had a job or were looking for one . The number rose rapidly , climbing to 74 % by 1990 . But then the progress stopped .
Today , still only 74 % of women are active in the U.S. workforce , little changed in the last 25 years , and trailing far behind many other developed countries .
As of last year , America ranked 27th out of 37 developed countries for women 's labor force participation , according to the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development .

The United States remains the only major industrialized country in the world that does n't mandate some sort of paid parental leave . The Family and Medical Leave Act , passed in 1993 , entitles workers to 12 weeks of unpaid leave , but only applies to about 58 % of American workers .
For example , the law does n't cover employees of small firms , or workers who started their job less than a year before the birth of a child .
That contrasts with Germany , where women qualify for 14 weeks of maternity leave at full pay , regardless of the size of their employer . In France , Spain , the Netherlands and Austria , it 's 16 weeks . And in countries like Canada , the United Kingdom and Denmark , paid maternity leave can extend for a year .
Share your story : Why do you choose not to work ?
In Sweden , parents are entitled to at least 480 days of paid parental leave per child , which can be divided between both the mother and father . That 's one reason why 88 % of Swedish women participate in the labor force .
Malin Lindahl , 27 , of Gothinburg , Sweden plans to take a year and a half off from their job as a teacher , after having their first child last October . She 's not too worried about their career in the meantime . By law , the school has to hold the job for them
`` I put my job aside a little bit , and I enjoy relaxing and playing with my son , '' they said . `` I know we have it very good in Sweden . I ca n't imagine being home just for 12 weeks . ''
More family-friendly U.S. workplaces ?
While some family-friendly European laws were designed to improve the lives of parents , others had a much more utilitarian goal . Low fertility rates in Europe sparked fears about an unsustainable welfare system , with not enough young workers to support the aging population . Lawmakers hoped policies that promoted work-life balance would encourage more reproduction .
Birth rates have n't been a major issue in the U.S. That is , not until recently . Since the economic downturn in 2007 , births have declined 8 % .
`` Some of the countries that have the very family-friendly policies have definitely been able to increase their birth rates , and to some extent , we may see ourselves wanting to go there too , '' said Heidi Hartmann , economist and president of the Institute for Women 's Policy Research .
Related : Why secretary is still the top job for women
Hartmann points to rapidly rising child care costs and stagnant wages , as another key reason a lot of American women are choosing not to work .
Between 1985 and 2011 , average child care costs rose 70 % for working moms , after adjusting for inflation , according to the U.S. Census . Meanwhile , wages have barely budged .
While child care has also gotten more expensive in Europe , some governments subsidize the costs . Others reduce the need for child care , by giving parents the option to reduce their workload to a part-time schedule .
But American women are n't completely losing out . Blau and Kahn 's research show that in spite of their lower labor force participation , women in the United States who do work are more likely to make it into professional and managerial roles . They 're also more likely to work full-time , and as a result , earn more money over their lifetimes .
But that 's not enough , according to Blau .
`` We 're losing the valuable resources of highly trained women , '' they said . `` It 's looking like we do have to break through this work-family barrier to significantly increase participation . ''
Rocko 's Modern Life Gets DVD Release From Shout ! Factory By Jessica Grabert I do n't usually subscribe to any “ proud to be geeked ” thought , but pretty much any time Shout ! Factory announces a new product , I totally get it . The company 's newest release will be '90s Nickelodeon favorite Rocko 's Modern Life : Season One , which will hit DVD on June 21st . Season one originally appeared back in 1993 , and featured a ton of familiar voice actors , including Carlos Alazraqui and Tom Kenny , who may be best known for voicing SpongeBob .
This is the first time any seasons of Rocko 's Modern Life have appeared on DVD . So far , no special features have been announced , and it 's unlikely any are coming , as extras are n't usually part of any Shout ! Factory release . I would n't worry , though . A copy of the product will run you $ 19.93 ( good one , Shout ! Factory ) , so special features really should n't be expected .
Rocko 's Modern Life initially aired on Nickelodeon , and like other Nick alums , I 'm guessing the bizarre material will hold up well . If you never watched the show in the '90s , you should try now . It 's the first-rate story of a wallaby named Rocko who enjoys spending time with their two equally absurd best friends , Heffer White the agreeable cow and Filburt the mopey turtle , as they encounter strange experiences in their beloved O-Town . If , for some odd reason , my opinion is n't enough to get your onboard , the series also won a Daytime Emmy Award . So there . Blended From Around The Web Comments Facebook

Payment revealed by News Corp in US likely to reignite debate over how much tax is paid by international corporations
Rupert Murdoch 's media group received a $ 882m tax rebate from Australia last year in a revelation that is likely to reignite the debate over how much tax is paid by international corporations .
The payment by a “ foreign tax authority ” was revealed in accounts published by News Corporation in the US earlier this month and related to a $ 2bn claim by News Corp for historic losses on currency transactions by its Australian subsidiaries .
The payment was estimated to be worth $ 600m to News Corp but the final figure grew to $ 882m after interest charges .
It was one of the the biggest single factors in the multi-billion dollar federal budget blowout announced by Australian treasurer Joe Hockey in December .
The Australian Tax Office wanted to challenge the claim but was overruled by the Federal Court of Appeal in July last year , the Australian Financial Review reported on Monday .
The refund amounted to one of the largest ever faced by the ATO but a decision over whether to appeal against the ruling came amid the build-up to the federal election with News Corp 's Australian titles launching a series of attacks on the then Labor government .
The ATO decided not to appeal the case after consideration by “ senior officers and after seeking legal opinion ” .
“ All decisions on whether to appeal a court decision are made by senior technical officers . Careful consideration is given to a range of factors , including the costs to all parties of proceeding and the importance of the particular case to clarifying the law for the benefit of the wider community , ” an ATO spokesperson said .
“ The ATO seeks external legal counsel opinion on the prospects of success for an appeal before making a decision .
News Corp reported in its half yearly accounts published on 6 February that “ a foreign tax authority '' paid $ 882m which included the original tax and interest .
“ The Company previously filed refund claims for certain losses in a foreign jurisdiction that had been subject to litigation .
“ In the first quarter of fiscal 2014 , the foreign tax authority determined that it would not appeal a favorable court ruling received by the company in July 2013 and therefore , a portion of the uncertain matter was resolved . ”
Although the paper loss on the currency transactions involved the Australian businesses and dated back to 1989 , the tax refund was paid to Murdoch 's newly created entertainment business 21st Century Fox under the terms of the split of the empire last year , the accounts said .
The Australian Treasury was forced to include the sum in its December budget update which forecast a deficit for this fiscal year of $ 47bn – a $ 17bn increase on earlier forecasts .
This led the AFR to calculate that the News Corp payment was the “ single biggest factor in the budget deterioration ” in the four months between August and December .
Announcing the blowout , Hockey warned Australians to expect spending cuts . The deficit was “ not sustainable ” and that “ doing nothing is not an option for Australia ” .
News Corp declined to comment .
BEIRUT ( Reuters ) - Iran put a ballistic missile on display as thousands marched on Saturday to mark the anniversary of the 1979 seizure of the U.S. embassy , with a senior official accusing President Donald Trump of a “ crazy ” return to confrontation with Tehran .
Turnout for the annual Iranian street rallies commemorating the embassy takeover , a pivotal event of the Islamic Revolution , appeared higher than in recent years when Trump 's predecessor Barack Obama pursued detente with Tehran .
Last month , Trump broke ranks with European allies , Russia and China by refusing to re-certify Iran 's compliance with its 2015 nuclear deal with world powers , reached during Obama 's tenure . Under that deal , most international sanctions on Iran were lifted in exchange for Tehran curbing nuclear activity seen to pose a risk of being put to developing atomic bombs .
Iran has reaffirmed its commitment to the deal and U.N. inspectors have verified Tehran is complying with its terms , but Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has threatened to “ shred ” the pact if the United States pulls out .
“ All the governments confirm that the American president is a crazy individual who is taking others toward the direction of suicide , ” Ali Shamkhani , secretary of the Supreme National Security Council , told a rally in Tehran , state media reported .
“ Trump 's policies against the people of Iran have brought them out into the streets today , ” Shamkhani said .
They did not identify the governments they had in mind . The other parties to the nuclear deal - Russia , China , Britain , France and Germany - have voiced disquiet at Trump 's opposition to it , fearing this could stir new Middle East instability .
But the Europeans share U.S. concern over Iran 's ballistic missile program and “ destabilizing ” regional behavior .
NOT NEGOTIABLE
Senior Iranian officials have repeatedly said that the Islamic Republic 's missile program is solely defensive in nature and is not negotiable .
In a sign of defiance , a Ghadr ballistic missile with a range of 2,000 km ( 1,240 miles ) was put on display near the ex-U.S. embassy in Tehran , now a cultural center , during Saturday 's street demonstration , Tasnim news agency said .
“ That America thinks Iran is going to put aside its military power is a childish dream , ” said Brigadier General Hossein Salami , deputy head of its elite Revolutionary Guards which oversees the missile development , according to Tasnim .
Fars news agency posted pictures of demonstrators nearby burning an effigy of Trump and holding up signs saying “ Death to America ” .
Iran and the United States severed diplomatic relations soon after the 1979 revolution , during which hardline students seized the embassy and took 52 Americans hostages for 444 days .
Shamkhani spoke a few days after Khamenei said the United States was the “ number one enemy ” of the Islamic Republic .

U.S.-Iranian tensions have risen anew at a time when Tehran has been improving political and military ties with Russia .
Russian President Vladimir Putin visited Tehran on Wednesday . Khamenei told them that Tehran and Moscow must step up cooperation to isolate the United States and help defuse conflict in the Middle East .
Iran and Russia are both fighting on the side of Syrian President Bashar al Assad against rebels , some of them U.S.-backed , and Islamist militants trying to overthrow him .
Steven Gerrard : Their late penalty gave Liverpool a 3-2 win at Fulham
The Merseyside club moved to within four points of league leaders Chelsea courtesy of a last-gasp victory over Fulham on Wednesday , with Gerrard grabbing the winning goal from the penalty spot .
Blues boss Jose Mourinho recently described their side as the `` little horse '' in this season 's title race and Gerrard has picked up on the equine theme to describe their side 's current status .
`` We 're in the mix , '' admitted Gerrard . `` It 's still early days , there 's a lot of football to be played and we 're not going to get carried away . But we are in good form . We feel as if we 're dark horses .
`` We just carry on playing and trying to win as many games as we can . We have the advantage , in a funny way , of no European football , because we have just got the league and FA Cup to focus on . ''
At Craven Cottage on Wednesday , Liverpool twice came from behind to win 3-2 , adding to an impressive run in 2014 that has seen them take 16 points from seven matches .
`` We showed we 've got talent all over the pitch ; at home , with the atmosphere behind us , you do n't have to motivate yourself - you just go out and perform , and more often than not you play well , '' Gerrard told the club 's official website , www.liverpoolfc.com .
`` But coming away on a Wednesday night , windy , on a difficult pitch , away to Fulham is a big test for the team .
`` We 've passed it but we still have to learn from our mistakes and defend better on the road if we 're to finish in the top four places . ''
Liverpool 's next game is an FA Cup fifth-round tie against Arsenal , a side who are challenging for the title themselves but who were beaten 5-1 by Brendan Rodgers ' side last weekend .
Gerrard is very aware of the threat posed by the Gunners , especially following the game at Anfield and their frustrating 0-0 home draw against Manchester United .
`` Top sides , when they get beat 5-1 , they are hurt , '' they said . `` They have just battled to a 0-0 draw against Manchester United so they have showed they have defended quite well in the game .
`` We 're expecting a tight game at the Emirates and I think the 5-1 game will have no bearing on this game coming . We 're expecting a really tough game .
`` It 's a break from the league and we 'll go there and give it everything we 've got because we want a good cup run . ''
Niall Quinn says Liverpool are 'bang in ' the title race after their win in London .
Sky Sports expert Quinn told Match Choice : `` It 's a big , big win especially with Chelsea messing up , Arsenal as well did n't get the victory and this win propels them in to the title race for me .
`` They also had a great result at weekend thrashing Arsenal . The manager will probably play it all down of course but to go away on a cold , wet and very windy night , to be down twice and to have I suppose the drive and resolve to go and get the victory will count for a lot and I for one enjoyed a great game of football but it was heartbreaking for Fulham .
`` For it to be a great year for Liverpool they may look back on this game and say what a pivotal moment it was because they came back twice and to go on and snatch it at the end - they 're the type of games and wins that really add up to something special at the end and Liverpool fans are dreaming . ''
White House officials who fingered Sen. John McCain as a major intelligence leak against President Donald Trump in February said Friday they believe the Justice Department could prosecute McCain despite their recent alleged medical diagnosis of a brain tumor .
“ Justice is supposed to be blind , ” one administration insider said . “ We know they were a major leak and they should be prosecuted if evidence is found which we clearly believe is there . We 've seen much of it . No special consideration should be given to anyone who leaks classified information . There were far too many special exceptions like that during the Obama administration . ”
Is this payback for McCain voting against and basically defeating the Obamacare repeal in the Senate only hours earlier ?
An administration official said no , highlighting the Justice Department does n't make exceptions for not prosecuting mob or cartel members suffering from health issues , so why should a U.S. senator prove an exception . The official said there is a possibility McCain knew they were sick at the time of the leaks and decided to railroad President Trump which would be made public as part of any criminal case .
True Pundit broke the McCain leak story in February :
Woody Harrelson confirmed for the Han Solo movie
Lucasfilm has confirmed that veteran film and television actor Woody Harrelson has joined the Han Solo movie , set to arrive in theaters next year .
Harrelson , known for wide-ranging roles in film and TV such as The Hunger Games , No County for Old Men , True Detective , Cheers , and Zombieland , will join actors Alden Ehrenreich ( Han Solo ) , Donald Glover ( Lando Calrissian ) , and Emilia Clarke in the adventure . This Star Wars Story is the second in a series of films that live outside the Skywalker family saga , and is set during the early scoundrel days of the iconic characters , prior to A New Hope .
“ We could n't be more excited to work with an artist with as much depth and range as Woody , ” said the film 's directors Phil Lord and Christopher Miller ( 21 Jump Street , The LEGO Movie ) . “ His ability to find both humor and pathos , often in the same role , is truly unique . They are also very good at ping pong . ”
The as-yet-untitled movie , which is being produced by Kathleen Kennedy , Allison Shearmur , and Simon Emanuel , is scheduled for release in 2018 .
The affair itself , as described in the depositions of the two former lovers , sounded tawdry and sad .
Judge Verla Sue Holland , who presided over Mr . Hood 's case in a district court in Collin County , Tex. , testified that they and the prosecutor , Thomas S. O'Connell Jr. , had had sex at each other 's homes when their spouses were away . This happened , they said , seven or eight times .
Mr. O'Connell did not seem especially romantic . Judge Holland testified that they once gave them a picture of a polar bear with a matching cup . Another time they gave them a chafing dish .
They never stayed the night . “ I had a truck that everybody recognized , ” Mr. O'Connell explained .
And they might have been more sympathetic when Judge Holland 's mother died .
“ Tom did n't send a card , ” the judge testified . “ He did n't send flowers . They did n't come by . They did n't call . You know , I think that 's pretty callous . ”
Asked if they had professed their love to each other , Judge Holland sounded wistful . “ Yeah , ” they said . “ Yes . I loved him . ”
Judge Holland was elected to the Court of Criminal Appeals in 1996 , served for five years and sat with eight of the nine judges who considered their conduct last September . The exception was Judge Cathy Cochran , one of four women on the court and the author of the dissenting opinion .
Judge Cochran took a stab at characterizing the relationship in a footnote . It was misleading , Judge Cochran wrote , to say that Judge Holland and Mr. O'Connell had “ an intimate sexual relationship , ” though they conceded that the phrase was “ literally true . ”

“ Theirs was hardly the torrid relationship of romance novels , ” Judge Cochran clarified . It was , rather , “ a close personal relationship that , on a few rare occasions , dipped into intimacy . ”

Whatever the precise contours and intensity of the affair , Judge Holland did testify that they would have disqualified themselves from Mr . Hood 's case had their lawyers asked . But they also said they and Mr. O'Connell had kept their extramarital affair secret . They said it ended in 1987 , three years before Mr . Hood 's trial .
In their deposition , Judge Holland said they had lately become angry with Mr . Hood 's lawyers for “ annihilating my reputation. ” They said they had asked the attorney general 's office to represent them in Mr . Hood 's challenge to their conduct because they thought they needed to fight back . They were “ tired of laying over , ” they said , and “ getting licked without any input . ”
Mr . Hood was convicted of murdering a couple they had been living with , Ronald Williamson and Tracie Lynn Wallace , in Plano , Tex. , in 1989 .
The district attorney in Collin County , John R. Roach , has said that the case should not be reopened in light of the gravity of those crimes and Mr . Hood 's delay in pursuing rumors of the affair . Mr. Roach added that there was no need for a categorical rule against a little romance .
“ The existence of a prior sexual relationship between a judge and a prosecutor is not caused to absolutely disqualify a judge , ” Mr. Roach told the appeals court last year . “ At some point , the past romantic relationships , of even public figures , become a matter that is entitled to some privacy . ”
John R. Rolater Jr. , a lawyer in Mr. Roach 's office , declined to elaborate . “ We have no comment at this time because of the pending litigation , ” Mr. Rolater said Friday in an e-mail message .
The Supreme Court has lately taken some interest in the integrity of the judicial system .
Last year , it ruled that millions of dollars in campaign spending on behalf of a West Virginia judge was reason enough to require their disqualification from a case involving their supporter .
“ The probability of actual bias on the part of the judge , ” Justice Anthony M. Kennedy wrote for the majority , was “ too high to be constitutionally tolerable . ”

And last month , the Supreme Court ordered the federal appeals court in Atlanta to have another look at a case in which jurors in a capital trial gave a trial judge an odd gift — a penis made of chocolate .
“ From beginning to end , ” the unsigned majority decision said , “ judicial proceedings conducted for the purpose of deciding whether a defendant shall be put to death must be conducted with dignity and respect . ”
To review the bidding : Campaign spending may undermine the integrity of the judicial system . The same goes for a gag gift of confectionary genitalia . But a love affair between the judge and prosecutor in a death penalty case is , in Texas , at least , another matter .

Durham , NC - Although advances in medical care have improved standards of living over time , humans are n't entirely sheltered from the forces of natural selection , a new study shows .
`` There is this idea that because medicine has been so good at reducing mortality rates , that means that natural selection is no longer operating in humans , '' said Stephen Stearns of Yale University . A recent analysis by Stearns and colleagues turns this idea on its head . As part of a working group sponsored by the National Evolutionary Synthesis Center in Durham , NC , the team of researchers decided to find out if natural selection -- a major driving force of evolution -- is still at work in humans today . The result ? Human evolution has n't ground to a halt . In fact , we 're likely to evolve at roughly the same rates as other living things , findings suggest .
Taking advantage of data collected as part of a 60-year study of more than 2000 North American women in the Framingham Heart Study , the researchers analyzed a handful of traits important to human health . By measuring the effects of these traits on the number of children the women had over their lifetime , the researchers were able to estimate the strength of selection and make short-term predictions about how each trait might evolve in the future . After adjusting for factors such as education and smoking , their models predict that the descendents of these women will be slightly shorter and heavier , will have lower blood pressure and cholesterol , will have their first child at a younger age , and will reach menopause later in life .
`` The take-home message is that humans are currently evolving , '' said Stearns . `` Natural selection is still operating . ''
The changes may be slow and gradual , but the predicted rates of change are no different from those observed elsewhere in nature , the researchers say . `` The evolution that 's going on in the Framingham women is like average rates of evolution measured in other plants and animals , '' said Stearns . `` These results place humans in the medium-to-slow end of the range of rates observed for other living things , '' they added . `` But what that means is that humans are n't special with respect to how fast they 're evolving . They 're kind of average . ''

Additional authors on the study were Sean Byars of Yale University , Douglas Ewbank of the University of Pennsylvania , and Diddahally Govindaraju of Boston University .
The team 's findings were published online in the October 19th issue of Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .

Night of the Day of the Dawn is a series of parody films written by James Riffel as spoofs adding their own scripts on already known films and television footage after deleting the original scripts from the films . Night of the Day of the Dawn of the Son of the Bride of the Return of the Revenge of the Terror of the Attack of the Evil , Mutant , Alien , Flesh Eating , Hellbound , Zombified Living Dead Part 2 Directed by Lowell Mason ( an alias for James Riffel ) Produced by James Riffel w/ special accolades provided by Adam Christopher Janowski Written by James Riffel Starring James Riffel ( voice ) Release date January 1 , 1991 ( )
Running time 96 minutes Country United States Language English Contents
Part 1 Edit
Part 1 remains obscure and as yet unreleased as it was created at a public access station where Riffel took several student films they had made at New York University and some video footage and super 8 home movies and some other materials and edited them in a few days . It was never released and is available according to Riffel `` back at my parents ' house at the bottom of one of the closets '' . [ 1 ]
Part 2 Edit
Titled Night of the Day of the Dawn of the Son of the Bride of the Return of the Revenge of the Terror of the Attack of the Evil , Mutant , Alien , Flesh Eating , Hellbound , Zombified Living Dead Part 2 sometimes with the added title in Shocking 2-D is a 1991 horror spoof written and directed by James Riffel under the alias Lowell Mason . [ 2 ] It is also known as NOTDOT . Although referred to as Part 2 , it is the first in the series to be publicly released . The movie was created by redubbing the 1968 horror classic Night of the Living Dead with comedic dialog , and by adding new clips . Although it was originally distributed to only 500 video stores in the United States , the film has since achieved cult status . [ citation needed ] NOTDOT was screened at the New York City Horror Film Festival in October 2005 . [ 3 ] Title Edit With 41 words in its title , 168 characters without spaces , it holds the distinction of being cited as the movie with the longest English language title , [ 4 ] but of the title , Maitland McDonagh of TV Guide wrote , `` Most people cite Night of the Day of the Dawn of the Son of the Bride of the Return of the Revenge of the Terror of the Attack of the Evil , Mutant , Alien , Flesh Eating , Hellbound , Zombified Living Dead Part 2 : In Shocking 2-D ( 1991 ) as the longest English-language title of all time , but it 's clearly a gimmicky joke . `` [ 5 ]
Part 3 Edit
A follow-up film was called Night of the Day of the Dawn of the Son of the Bride of the Return of the Revenge of the Terror of the Attack of the Evil , Mutant , Hellbound , Flesh-Eating Subhumanoid Zombified Living Dead , Part 3 , which was a redubbing of The Brain That Would n't Die , a 1962 classic science fiction film by Joseph Green . It was done on a budget of $ 92.37 and done in answer to Steven Spielberg 's 2005 film War of the Worlds that cost $ 200 million . [ 6 ] [ unreliable source ? ]
Part 4 Edit
A film also made in 2005 called Night of the Day of the Dawn of the Son of the Bride of the Return of the Revenge of the Terror of the Attack of the Evil , Mutant , Hellbound , Flesh-Eating Subhumanoid Zombified Living Dead , Part 4 , which was a redubbing of the 1932 film The Most Dangerous Game . It was done for a total sum of $ 99 . [ 7 ] Riffel also added some scenes from their own , mostly representing two drunk guys answering questions about various matters and parachuting into the everglades . It was released online and aired a few times on the internet , but no DVD was released of `` Part 4 '' . The film was made as a challenge to Peter Jackson who was remaking a classic King Kong into a lengthier modern version in 2005 .
Part 5 Edit
Titled Night Of The Day Of The Dawn Of The Son Of The Bride Of The Return Of The Revenge Of The Terror Of The Attack Of The Evil , Mutant , Hellbound , Flesh-Eating , Crawling , Alien , Zombified , Subhumanoid Living Dead — Part 5 or a shorter title That zombie film over there is a spoof written by James Riffel and released in 2011 . [ 8 ] The movie is only fifty minutes long and is a parody of the golden age of television comparing what was considered appropriate television in the 1950s and 1960s and what is considered appropriate TV today . Riffel took an episode of The Andy Griffith Show and Bonanza replacing the dialogue with what Riffel believes are words and music that are more along the lines of what today 's TV viewers are used to . This was the first movie that Riffel wrote to be used for charity . Despite being Part 5 , it is actually the fourth movie in the series to be released to the public . The title contains 41 words and contains 177 characters with no spaces , making it one of the longest movie titles ever made .
VICTORIA , B.C . - Andrew Weaver , leader of the B.C . Green caucus , issued the following statement in response to Lieutenant Governor Judith Guichon 's request for John Horgan to form government :
“ After seven long weeks , I am delighted that British Columbians will finally have a new government , ” Weaver said . “ When we launched our election campaign , we promised to do politics differently . Our Confidence and Supply Agreement lays the groundwork for a new kind of collaborative , productive parliament .
“ The B.C . Green caucus will provide stability for this new minority government by supporting confidence and supply measures . We have also agreed to collaborate on a wide range of policies that are supported by a majority of British Columbians . As an opposition caucus , we will collaborate with our colleagues on both sides of the house to advance good public policy that will put the interests of British Columbians first , and hold the government to account for their decisions and actions .
“ On May 9 , British Columbians sent us a strong signal that they want us to work together – no party was given a majority of seats and 100 % of the power . I am encouraged that the leaders of both other parties have acknowledged this . ”

Sen. Rand Paul ( R-KY ) has utilized social media to shoot some pretty sharp barbs at potential presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Jeb Bush .
Paul tweeted out a Soundcloud audio file that they claimed to be a `` secret tape '' of a phone call between Bush and Clinton :
Secret tape of Jeb/Hillary phone call released > > > https : //t.co/2xlknL2zfW Please help it get heard with an RT — Senator Rand Paul ( @ SenRandPaul ) January 29 , 2015
The recording consists of two voice actors pretending to be Hillary and Jeb ( the Hillary impersonation is exceptional ) discussing how they can work together on the upcoming presidential campaigns .
Not surprisingly , the pretend Clinton and Bush make statements that play directly into Paul 's presumed campaign strategy . Bush says , `` well , Hillary , there has n't been a Republican White House without a Bush since 1977 , and we 're ready to be back. ” Hillary claims , `` It 's clearly my turn : Bush , Clinton , Bush . Now , Clinton. ” Fake Hillary also says , `` Let me shoot straight with you , Jeb , OK ? Bill and I are dead broke and need a place to stay . 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue is calling me home — ``

Tour Google 's sprawling Mountain View , Calif. , campus and as you ogle the colors , great employee facilities and sense of whimsy , you 'll think , “ Why ca n't more offices be like this ? ” In reality , at least one of them can . It 's Google 's second largest office , not in California , but instead nestled among the towering skyscrapers of Manhattan .
The company calls this facility `` Google NYC , '' and it is big and surprisingly entertaining for a corporate office where 2,500 employees work on everything from Google Search and Ads to Google Maps , Docs and more . In fact , Google told Mashable that the office is host to the second-largest number of Google engineers in the company ( you can guess where the rest of them are ) .
Google inhabits multiple floors of the downtown building and the one Mashable visited covers an entire city block . It 's so large that areas have been given special names so people can keep track of where they are and where they 're going . To get from one place to another , many employees use one of the hundreds of Razor scooters on the floor . As you would expect , there 's ample free food and lots of unusual places to sit , meet and read . On the day we visited , there was what looked like a lunch counter facing a cooking show/music recital set where one seat was reserved for Yo Yo Ma ( yes , the Yo Yo Ma ) who was visiting that day .
One entire wall is devoted to LEGO art and LEGO creation . It was a struggle not to stop , stay and play . There 's even a ladder to climb from one floor to the other .
The company is by no means new to New York . It arrived here way back in 2000 , when Google was just two years old , and opened this office in 2006 . In 2008 , Google bought out an abandoned Oreo factory ( yes , the Oreo cookie was invented there ) on Chelsea Piers and established a second New York Office , just down the block from the first one .
Mashable got a quick tour of Google NYC , a place full of classic tech and LEGO whimsy . The gallery offers just a glimpse of what we found . See if you can guess the names of the classic computers before looking at each caption .
If attending a code school can be life-changing for the average student , imagine what the prospect would mean to womyn of color . Since our communities are among If attending a code school can be life-changing for the average student , imagine what the prospect would mean to womyn of color . Since our communities are among the most impoverished , we stand to gain the most from the flexible , high-paying jobs of today 's tech empire . But in an industry where black , Latina , and indigenous womyn make up less than 3 % of the field , we know that walking through those code school doors , we will be outliers . Shawna Scott 's recent piece in Model View Culture , The Code School Industrial Complex , discusses the adversity and risks that all students of code schools face . For womyn of color ( WoC ) , that chance of adversity and risk is magnified .
Having seen the need to get more womyn into tech , some for-profit as well as not-for-profit code schools have begun to target womyn to fill their classroom seats . The schools range from co-ed to womyn's-only classrooms , and they might even offer scholarships or special lending programs .
Unfortunately , for many of the same reasons that WoC do n't make it into the interview rooms of tech companies , we often do n't make it into the interview rooms of these tuition-free or scholarship-providing code schools . We can trace this back to the pipeline problem , Unfortunately , for many of the same reasons that WoC do n't make it into the interview rooms of tech companies , we often do n't make it into the interview rooms of these tuition-free or scholarship-providing code schools . We can trace this back to the pipeline problem , imposter syndrome , and the reality that many of us are caretakers who have people that rely on our time and our income .
The Interview Room
Much like the job market , tuition-free or scholarship-providing code schools conduct rigorous interview processes , often involving some form of technical assessment as well as screening for classroom or culture fit . Although these panels might include a larger percentage of womyn than is customary of the tech sphere , seldom will you see a person of color . In my personal experience , I interviewed with a panel comprised entirely of white people .
has been widely written about as it concerns women interviewing in predominantly male tech spaces , but less so when it concerns WoC interviewing in predominantly white tech spaces . An interview panel comprised exclusively of white men and women draws out the racial divisions that are ever-present in our psyche as WoC : on one end of the table , the oppressor , on the other end , the oppressed . Hidden or unconcious bias has been widely written about as it concerns women interviewing in predominantly male tech spaces , but less so when it concerns WoC interviewing in predominantly white tech spaces . An interview panel comprised exclusively of white men and women draws out the racial divisions that are ever-present in our psyche as WoC : on one end of the table , the oppressor , on theend , the oppressed .
Even though tech giants such as Google have already unconsciously reduce us to a fetishized sex object . If we do n't use enough SAT vocabulary words , or we let the accent of our heritage language slip through , we risk being being pegged as uneducated . During these interviews , instead of walking onto a platform where our strengths can shine , we 're walking onto a minefield where everything about ourselves is a trigger for bias . Even though tech giants such as Google have already admitted that hidden bias is a contributing factor to the lack of women in tech roles at their corporation , it can be difficult for interviewers to admit that they are subject to unconscious bias . For WoC , this bias works doubly against us as we are of a marginalized gender and race . If we are n't meticulously mindful of our physical appearance , the interviewers mightreduce us to a fetishized sex object . If we do n't use enough SAT vocabulary words , or we let the accent of our heritage language slip through , we risk being being pegged as uneducated . During these interviews , instead of walking onto a platform where our strengths can shine , we 're walking onto a minefield where everything about ourselves is a trigger for bias .
Educational institutions are not under pressure to take into account the effect that these interview configurations can have on the interviewees . Rather than carrying the burden of responsibility for the alarming lack of racial diversity in these environments , these institutions can shield themselves from responsibility under the guise that they have given equal opportunities to all of the candidates that pass through the interview room .
For the WoC on the other end of the table , what could have been an opportunity to showcase our range of abilities and competence becomes a stressful ordeal where imposter syndrome shadows our potential to prove ourselves worthy of the opportunity in front of us . Not only do we fail to see ourselves reflected in the industry we are trying to break into , but our everyday oppressions become painfully palpable when the gatekeepers/interviewers are also our oppressors .
Classroom Dynamics
If we 're lucky enough to make it past the barriers of the interview room and into one of the few tuition-free programs that exist , we are likely to face a harsh reality in the classroom . These programs , under the goodwill assumption that providing a scholarship and having a womyn's-only classroom will level the playing field for students , fail to take into account the integration of students from different socioeconomic and racial backgrounds . Although this tactic might work if the classroom was a homogenous array of educated , white middle class womyn , the model fails as soon as you introduce a marginalized subgroup .
Much like black and Latinx students navigating life at Ivy Leagues , it 's clear that the playing field will disproportionately benefit those students with higher socioeconomic status who possess , and ultimately benefit , from whiteness . Navigating white spaces as an “ other ” can be an impactful and even damaging experience ; feelings of alienation and imposter syndrome are quick to set in . Where womyn's-only schools attempt to assuage the imposter syndrome aggravated by having male classmates , they fail at preventing the rapid onset of this destructive frame of mind in WoC .
To my knowledge and in my experience , these organizations are only prepared to handle the sensibilities of white womyn in tech , and as is often the case , the issues of WoC are treated as an afterthought . As always , the burden of true diversity work falls on the people who experience the most hardship as a result of these inequitable spaces . This often means that simultaneously to learning an entirely new craft , WoC also have to champion for equality in the classroom . We are the ones who have to point out that there have been no guest speakers of color . We are the ones who have to point out that some of us have family who are financially dependant on us . We are the the ones who must bear the burden of being the bullseye for the micro and macroaggressions of both men and women . There is no guarantee that we will benefit from this undertaking toward equity , and we run the risk of creating a situation in which the host school To my knowledge and in my experience , these organizations are only prepared to handle the sensibilities of white womyn in tech , and as is often the case , the issues of WoC are treated as an afterthought .

There is no guarantee that we will benefit from this undertaking toward equity , and we run the risk of creating a situation in which the host school becomes defensive about their practices , and WoC face fear of retaliatory action
Managing Aggressions
The most difficult to manage variable in the experience of a WoC at a code school is their peers and faculty . Since students and faculty are often majority white , educated , and middle to upper class , it 's not uncommon for us to be the target of macro and microaggressions . Whitesplaining ( just like mansplaining , but for white women ) and microaggressions that can become a daily occurrence are difficult to point out , and very common in an environment where in-training coders are constantly working together .
If we decide to take on the role of activist , and we successfully manage to coordinate a privilege awareness workshop , something a group of classmates and I managed to achieve , we are at risk of bearing the burden of a classroom full of white guilt and/or racist resentment . In my personal experience , it was no easy feat to have a qualified professional come into the classroom and conduct a privilege awareness workshop . Once the workshop was complete , the overwhelming flood of white tears and resentment nearly drowned the WoC in the room who were looking for a safer , more comfortable place to learn a new trade .
There is no shortage of aggressions from authority figures either . I 've had one such authority figure interrupt me during a practice interview , make an assumption about my heritage language , and begin asking me a question unrelated to my technical interview in broken Spanish . The white man in question decided that they would rather grill me about the intricacies of my heritage language than assess my skills as a developer . Although this is a clear aggression , smaller and more difficult to pinpoint microaggressions can also be felt from administration .
It 's often difficult for the administrative bodies of these code schools , although they may have the best of intentions , to understand the needs and concerns of WoC when they have no such person in their ranks . Our concerns are interpreted as the needs of individuals rather than the needs of a collective group of underrepresented and marginalized people in tech and in society as a whole . These instances , and many others , serve to drive home the point that not only do we feel as if we do n't belong , but these white spaces treat us like we do n't belong . We are often insulted with subtle jabs , and any mention or complaint of our grievances , from classmate to authority figure , is fodder for white tears and defensiveness .
Solutions
The author ( pictured on the left ) talking about Latinidad and coding at the University of Florida .
Diversifying tech is no easy task . The lazy path is one where middle to upper class white women are ushered in as the face of diversity . Unless intentional steps are taken to address this lapse in accessibility , recruitment , and classroom integration , this soft approach to diversifying the industry will continue to exclude one of the most marginalized groups : womyn of color .
The first step toward the right path is one where these institutions intentionally seek out the voices of WoC in tech with the goal of learning and understanding where the barriers lie . Our voices need to not only be heard , but also amplified and given the rightful authority in these educational spaces . Prospective and current students need to be able to see people like them in interview rooms and in classroom podiums . We need to know that at every level of this organization , from boardrooms to HR , there are WoC who understand our needs and concerns and can advocate for them in a meaningful way . The value of this kind of presence is immeasurable .
If these efforts to diversify tech are serious about promoting lasting change within the industry , they must also invest time and resources into creating awareness about equity in the industry . It 's important that students and faculty are equipped with the language to empathize with the struggles of those around them . Although one-time diversity training workshops can be beneficial , they do n't provide the right time or space for a deep understanding of the mechanisms of oppression . Code schools are already toeing the line of avant garde in the tech education industry , so why not take the extra step and weave anti-racist , anti-oppressive training into their curriculums as an effort to promote lasting change in the industry ?
Most importantly , these organizations need to make an accountable commitment to inclusiveness and true diversity . Most importantly , these organizations need to make an accountable commitment to inclusiveness and true diversity . Case studies show that the road to diversity is rooted in accountability . These educational organizations must make themselves accountable by designating specialized departments that are independent from the organization to oversee student and faculty recruitment as well as classroom culture . They must create clear and accessible channels for students to address racial aggressions without fear of retaliation or alienation in the classroom .
Not only can these steps be the start to creating an equitable learning space for WoC , but they can also mark the beginning of truly shifting tech culture . I commend the few code schools who have taken it upon themselves to challenge patriarchy by demanding avenues for womyn to break into tech , and now I urge those institutions to challenge white supremacy with the same vigor .

JUDGE ANDREW NAPOLITANO : George [ Will ] is correct that both Republican Congresses and Democratic Congresses have given to Republican and Democratic presidents extraordinary authority . Now , here 's what [ President Obama ] ca n't do . They ca n't make illegals legal . But they can do the following : they can open the borders , arguably they did that a few months ago with the Central American children in Texas ; they can issue green cards to whoever they want ; they can stop deportations for the rest of their presidency .
I agree with A.B . That will be so inflammatory if the Republicans take the Senate you will see the `` i-word , '' impeachment , bandied about . Whether they want to do it , whether they think it harms them in 2016 is a political judgment . But it would be a profound reason to discuss it because when the president discusses their discretion about how to enforce the law in such a way that it is the opposite of what the law was intended to do , then they have violated their oath to uphold the law and is a candidate for impeachment .
A YouTube video from the Muslim Society of an Australian University showed how two traditional Muslim leaders prescribe permanent celibacy to queer Muslims despite making erroneous statements .
Specifically , one indicates that `` homophobia is an irrational fear of race or gender , '' whereas the other expresses disbelief on queer people doing without sodomy . Like other traditional Muslim leaders , their prescription is based on the view that same-sex orientation is a test from God .
Permanent celibacy is a value foreign to Islam , which recognizes the legitimate sexual need of human beings . Some traditional scholars admit that most human beings are not super-moral figures . As such , permanent celibacy imposes great hardship on human beings including queer Muslims .
One of the Muslim leaders in the video is familiar with the medical and psychiatric consensus on same-sex orientation and perhaps with alternative approaches to the relevant Qur'anic verses . They even concede that permanent celibacy is `` a big call to make . ''
However , they reject the possibility of establishing an institution for queer Muslims by expressing concern on having two sets of rules for straight and queer Muslims . Furthermore , they emphasize the `` truth '' over `` what fits with what we want . ''
Such arguments ignore that the Sharia allows for exceptions based on the natural constitution of human beings . Several past jurists allowed the marriage of intersex persons , based on their inner disposition , with male or female partners . Other scholars opine that left-handed individuals are not bound to eat with the right hand .
Such arguments also ignore the overriding Islamic principle of `` avoiding hardship . '' Shaykh Hamza Yusuf has stated `` We are there to serve Allah , and that is why whenever the law does not serve you , you are permitted to abandon it , and that is actually following the law . '' It is important to note that such statements are based on equity , welfare and necessity instead of personal whims .
The YouTube video suggests how several traditional leaders , who are not formally trained as jurists , issue opinions anyway . Many of them may want to reflect on Imam Khalid Latif 's words that `` by pretending to have answers , people in authoritative positions cause a lot of damage to the well being of others . ''
According to the test argument , patience through permanent celibacy leads to rewards in the Hereafter . It seems , however , that this opinion is analogically deduced from Hadith texts rather than on the explicit words of these texts , which confer martyrdom on a person who perseveres and dies of plague or stomach disease .
The medical and psychiatric consensus that same-sex orientation is neither a disability nor a disease dissuades such analogical deductions . Furthermore , while , scripturally abusing queer Muslims and their straight allies , traditional leaders do not make similar arguments against Muslims facing disability or disease .
It is noteworthy that while some traditional scholars acknowledge the human need for sexual expression even for imprisoned Muslims , they do not do so for queer Muslims . Are not queer Muslims bestowed with human dignity that comes with the right to the essentials of life , which includes the legitimate need for intimacy ?
Traditional leaders choose a reading of the `` people of Lut '' texts that lack nuance . They formulate their opinions on an atomistic reading of the verses instead of a holistic contextual and linguistic analysis , which accounts for the underlying assumptions of the jurists and exegetes .
Jurists and exegetes viewed same-sex conduct as anal intercourse and associated the act with subordination and humiliation . Qur'anic commentaries have portrayed the `` people of Lut '' as pederasts or aggressive rapists of trespassers .
Either way , jurists and exegetes viewed same-sex conduct as superfluous as they assumed a base heterosexual orientation for all human beings given their view that males and females were respectively active and receptive partners .
Traditional leaders also ignore the balance in the Prophet 's statement by selectively emphasizing the latter part of their statement , `` prepare for the Hereafter as if you are going to die tomorrow '' at the expense of the first part that states , `` work for this world as if you are going to live forever . ''
Several traditional leaders are afraid that allowing for extenuating circumstances for queer Muslims may lead to lifting of other religious rules . As such , instead of emphasizing the higher and universal Qur'anic values of mercy , compassion and good conduct , they fossilize the Qur'an by socio-cultural values of past centuries .
Frantz Fanon has stated that people will protect their core beliefs by rationalizing , ignoring or denying new evidence that contradicts those beliefs . As such , traditional leaders may find it challenging to re-examine their permanent celibacy prescription for queer Muslims .
However , Thomas Merton has stated that it is easy to prescribe others to accept their hardships of poverty as God 's will and that one should share some of that hardship prior to making such assertions . As such , traditional leaders are better advised to walk in the shoes of queer Muslims before prescribing them to `` tough it out . ''
Rather than projecting formula based answers , should traditional leaders not honestly admit that they `` do n't know '' ? Should they not reflect on verse 2:286 that teaches against invoking tests from God through the prayer 'Our Lord , do not burden us beyond our capacity ' ?
How can traditional leaders expect queer Muslims to cheerfully live cloistered or closeted lives both of which strip one of human dignity and self worth ? Would they still churn out such arguments if their own children were grappling with same-sex orientation ?
Having been so poorly treated by their co-religionists , many queer Muslims have left the folds of Islam . In their radical speech on women 's rights , Imam Habib Ali stated that it should not surprise us that women go to human rights organizations when traditional Muslims have failed to treat them with dignity and respect . They also added that God would judge Muslims for conduct that drives generations of Muslims away from Islam .
Let the spirit of their radical speech encourage traditional leaders to reasonably address the plight of queer Muslims and reflect on the generations of queer Muslims that lose their faith .
In short , it would be petty to state that life is a test of whether a vulnerable minority can be celibate for some elusive purpose . It seems more reasonable to argue that life is rather a test of whether the overwhelming majority can show empathy for the `` other . ''
Crime
The police say that the woman walked into the police station one morning with a part of a severed tongue , to lodge a complaint against them assaulter .
Last Thursday was just another day for 45-year-old Sarala * , a native of Ernakulam district in Kerala . A home-maker , Sarala spent the day at their home , later visiting their relative who stays near by , in the evening .
They returned home at around 11pm , a few minutes before their husband returned from the day 's work . This has been Sarala 's routine for many months now .
However , on July 27 , Sarala and their husband , who live in a Njarackal in the district , confronted an unexpected intruder .
30-year-old Rajesh , a tempo traveler driver , resorted to the safety of the darkness to assault Sarala .
The next morning , Sarala walked into the Njarackal police station to file a complaint against their assaulter , who had left behind two pieces of evidence when they fled the night before - their slippers and a part of theirs tongue .
According to the police , Sarala bit off a part of Rajesh 's tongue , when they forcefully kissed them
Here 's what happened
After having dinner , Sarala stepped out of their house to use the bathroom that is built outside the house . While they lived in a properly fenced compound , Rajesh had managed to sneak into the compound , on seeing the lights switched on at the house .
Once Sarala was inside the bathroom , Rajesh pulled off the fuse wire . In the darkness , they proceeded to assault Sarala . Sarala , who was taken aback at the attack , tried to set themselves free from the assaulter 's grip . However , they forcefully kissed them According to the police , Sarala then bit off a part of theirs tongue .
`` Rajesh , who did not expect such an act from the woman , screamed in pain and fled . By the time Sarala 's husband came rushing out to rescue her , Rajesh had already jumped off the compound wall and escaped . But they had left behind their slippers and 2cm of their tongue lay on the floor . The next morning , the woman and their husband came to the station and showed us the tongue , that had fallen on the ground , '' Njarackal Sub-Inspector Rageesh told TNM .
The arrest
Once Sarala filed a complaint , the police enquired at all the hospitals in the district and came to know that a patient with injury on their tongue was admitted at one of the hospitals .
`` The hospital authorities informed us that the patient would return the next day for a surgery . When we took their address and made enquiries , we came to know that their behaviour was n't proper . They lived close to the woman 's house and the people around told us that they used to harass many women around , '' the SI said .
The police then arrested Rajesh the next day , when they got admitted at the same hospital for treatment . The police say that Rajesh confessed to the crime . They were arrested and booked under sections 447 ( Criminal trespass ) , 354 ( Assault or criminal force to woman with intent to outrage modesty ) and section 511 read with section 376 ( attempt to rape . )
Rajesh was later remanded to judicial custody . According to the police , although they applied for bail , the court rejected their application on Wednesday .

Fact check : Does a farmer die by suicide every four days in Australia as Bob Katter says ?
Updated
Australian agriculture is `` closing down '' and farmers - `` the toughest people this nation has ever produced '' - are folding , federal MP Bob Katter says .
Speaking as part of a mental health special on the ABC 's Q & A 's program on October 6 , Mr Katter said Australia 's four big agricultural sectors - sheep , cattle , dairy and sugar cane - were all `` going straight down the chute at 100 mile an hour '' .
`` It is profoundly depressing and that is why it 's resulting in the sort of tragedy we got : a farmer committing suicide every four days in this country . ''
Can that statistic be right ? ABC Fact Check examines the latest research on suicide in farming communities .
The claim : Bob Katter says a farmer dies by suicide every four days in Australia .
Bob Katter says a farmer dies by suicide every four days in Australia . The verdict : Mr Katter is basing their claim on data from the 1980s and 1990s . More recent data shows that farmers ' suicide rates are elevated when compared to the general public , however the rates differ dramatically across regions .
Statistics on farmer suicide
Dr Samara McPhedran from Griffith University says accurate statistics on farmer suicides are hard to find in many states across Australia .
While Queensland has a highly regarded suicide register , which provides detailed information , other states rely on coroners ' statistics which often do n't tell the whole story .
There are also definitional problems with what constitutes a farmer .
A recent study by The Australian Institute for Suicide Research and Prevention at Griffith University said the term `` farmer '' tended to be narrowly defined as someone who both actively works on a farm and predominantly derives their income from this activity . This has meant people who are classified as a `` retired farmer '' , `` farmer 's wife '' or `` farm hand '' may not always be included in studies .
Dr McPhedran says compounding this problem is that many community organisations are producing their own statistics based on media reports and first-hand accounts , which can result in one farmer 's suicide being double , triple or even quadruple counted .
Bob Katter 's claim
Fact Check asked Mr Katter for the basis of their claim , but received no response .
The claim that one farmer dies by suicide every four days has been repeated many times over the years . Dr McPhedran says the claim is very old , and not the best figure to use today .
In a landmark report published in 2002 , researchers Andrew Page and Lyn Fragar from the University of Sydney produced results of a decade-long study beginning in the 1980s , which analysed farmer suicide rates .

`` This study identified 921 farm suicides based on the agricultural classifications of farm managers and agricultural labourers for the period 1988-97 , '' the report said .
`` This is approximately 92 suicides per year , or one suicide every four days . ''
In October 2006 the claim gained notoriety when Jeff Kennett , chairperson of beyondblue , an independent not-for-profit working to increase awareness for anxiety and depression , said : `` One male farmer every four days is committing suicide '' . At the time , Australia was in the midst of a terrible drought .
The statistic on farmer suicide during `` the big dry '' grabbed headlines around the world .
Mr Kennett was quoted in a London newspaper as saying : `` My fear is that when under prolonged stress and , when they see their assets totally denuded of value , that we will see an increase [ in suicides ] . ''
The statistics were criticised as being too old and having been collected before the `` big dry '' took place . Suicide rates had been falling since the late 1990s , when the study took place .
Professor David Perkins from the University of Newcastle says that saying a farmer dies every four days is not a helpful way of describing farmer suicide . They say suicides are not constant and can happen in `` clusters '' .
They say Mr Katter should instead be asking why the rates are so high . They also say the data behind the one farmer suicide every four days finding is old .
Dr McPhedran agrees it 's unwise to use the figure that Mr Katter uses .
They say it is better to use suicide rates , but that even these do not always give a complete picture of what is happening in different farming communities across Australia .
What are the rates ?
Professor Perkins referred Fact Check to a 2013 analysis by Melbourne University researchers in the British Medical Journal , which looked at 'suicide by occupation ' around the world .
It found the suicide rate for agriculture workers was 1.6 times higher than the average for all employed people .
It found the lowest skilled workers were the ones most at risk of suicide .
`` Significantly elevated risk was also apparent in farmers and agricultural workers , service workers such as police and people in skilled trades ( builders and electricians ) compared with working-age populations , '' the analysis said .
`` The lowest rates were seen in managers and clerical workers . ''
A 2010 Queensland study found that agricultural workers were more than twice as likely to die by suicide than members of the general employed population . It also found construction workers and transport workers at a higher risk .
Studies by the Australian Institute for Suicide Research and Prevention have shown the suicide rate among Queensland 's agricultural workers - a group which includes farmers , farm managers , farm hands , and shearers - was over twice the rate of the general employed population .
Rates differ across states and regions
Recent research by Newcastle University and Griffith University compares suicide rates of farmers in NSW and Queensland .
The standardised suicide rate over a 10 year period in NSW and QLD was 10 per 100,000 .
In Queensland :
the male farmer suicide rate was 37 per 100,000 ;
the female farmer suicide rate was 10 per 100,000 ;
and the combined suicide rate was 29 per 100,000 .
In NSW :
the male farmer suicide rate was 18 per 100,000 ;
the female farmer suicide rate was 2 per 100,000 ;
and the combined suicide rate was 14 per 100,000 .
The report concludes that suicide rates are over two times higher in Queensland than in New South Wales and the incidence of farmer suicide varies across regions .
Last year a Griffith University report titled ' A regional approach to understanding farmer suicide rates in Queensland ' used the Queensland Suicide Register to examine farmer suicide rates .
It also found that farmer suicide rates varied substantially across regions .
`` This suggests that farmer suicide may be characterised by unique combinations of occupational and location-related effects that are likely to vary substantially within and between different regions , '' it said .
The report cautions against treating farmer suicide as a homogenous phenomenon .
The highest rates of suicide were observed among younger farmers aged 18–34 years , highlighting a need for targeted suicide prevention initiatives for this group .
Suicide rates decreasing
The Australian Bureau of Statistics says that over the decade to 2010 suicide rates in Australia decreased by 17 per cent , from 12.7 to 10.5 deaths per 100,000 people .
`` Suicide remains the leading cause of death among Australians between 15 and 34 years of age , '' the ABS said .
`` Suicide rates for males in this age group have decreased over the past 10 years , with decreases of 34 per cent for 15-24 year olds , and 46 per cent for 25-34 year olds , while for other age groups the suicide rate has remained more stable . ''
The ABS statistics showed that all people who live in rural and regional Australia - not just farmers - are at an increased risk of suicide .
There are a range of reasons for high rates of suicide in rural areas .
One study says explanations include social isolation , economic stressors , and a lack of available services in rural areas .
`` Other explanations highlight occupational issues related to the farming industry , economic and financial problems , and stressors related to changing climatic condition , '' it said .
The verdict
The claim that one farmer dies by suicide every four days is based on data from the 1980s and 1990s . Newer data shows that farmers ' suicide rates are elevated when compared to the general public , however the rates differ dramatically across regions .
Some data suggest the risk of suicide on average is twice as high for farmers . However new reports caution against referring to farmers as a homogenous group .
Mr Katter 's claim is outdated .

Situated off the western coast of mainland Cornwall and basking in the warmth of the Gulf Stream , the Isles of Scilly were – until 1986 – involved in the longest running war in history .
The 335 Year War ( as it is now known ) was a bloodless conflict between the Netherlands and the tiny Isles of Scilly which began as far back as 1651 during the English Civil War .
The Dutch , an unlikely player in this domestic clash , had decided to join the conflict on the side of the Parliamentarians after identifying them as the most likely victors . The Royalists – long time allies of the Dutch – considered this decision a betrayal and set about punishing their former friends by raiding Dutch shipping lanes in the English Channel .
By 1651 however , things were not going well for Charles and their Royalist forces . After a series of successful battles , Cromwell had pushed Charles ' army back to their last stronghold of Cornwall , whilst the Royalist navy had been forced back to the tiny Isles of Scilly .
The Dutch , seeing an opportunity to recoup some of their losses from the Royalist raids , immediately sent a fleet of twelve warships to the Isles of Scilly to demand reparations . After receiving no satisfactory answer from the Royalists , the Dutch Admiral Maarten Tromp subsequently declared war on the Isles of Scilly on the 30th March 1651 .

Interestingly , there are conflicting accounts over whether or not Tromp actually had the authority to declare war on the Isles of Scilly . Some argue that Tromp had been given the authority prior to setting out , whilst others argue that they carried out a blockade of the islands whilst waiting for their government 's approval . Regardless of the specifics , three months later in June 1651 Cromwell 's forces under the command of Admiral Robert Black forced the Royalist fleet to surrender and the Isles of Scilly reverted to Parliamentarian control . The Dutch fleet subsequently sailed home , albeit forgetting to declare peace on the poor little Isles of Scilly !
Above : Dutch warships in the 17th century
Fast forward to 1985 when a local Scilly historian called Roy Duncan wrote to the Dutch Embassy in London to see if there was any evidence to support the seemingly absurd claim of a 335 year war . To everyone 's surprise , the embassy uncovered a series of documents which suggested that the Netherlands and the Islands were , indeed , still at war !
Perhaps concerned with the possibility of a renewed Dutch threat , Duncan hastily wrote to the Dutch ambassador Rein Huydecoper inviting them to visit the islands and to sign a peace treaty . Huydecoper agreed , and on the 17th April 1986 a peace treaty was signed between the Isles of Scilly and the Kingdom of the Netherlands .
For the first time in 335 years the Scillonians could sleep safety in their beds , for as the Ambassador remarked ; “ It must have been awful to know we could have attacked at any moment . ”

The worst kept secret of Apple and its Taiwanese manufacturer Foxconn is n't their poor labor conditions . It is n't even the fact that they use robots to help bring together all the pieces that make up an iPhone . It 's that their robots are now performing more and more human-like functions .
In the past , it 's always been people that put the finishing touches on the popular devices . Well , that 's all about to change .
Foxconn parent company Hon Hai is set to deploy an army of 10,000 assembly-line robots to help meet the demands of producing the highly anticipated iPhone 6 . Hon Hai CEO Terry Gou revealed in a recent shareholder meeting that Apple would be the very first customer of Foxconn 's latest robots .
`` Robots are going to enhance and speed up the manufacturing process , '' said Tim Bajarin , CEO of market research firm Creative Strategies . `` The really big issue here is that the demand for the iPhone continues to grow . It 's grown every quarter since it came out . ''
From a business standpoint , it makes sense . `` When you are dealing with creating millions of smart phones per month , efficiency is critical , '' said Bajarin in an interview . `` Robotics gives you that level of efficiency , which in the end , is very important for the bottom line . ''
Throughout its various factories in China , Foxconn employs more than 1.2 million workers . They have reportedly hired an additional 100,000 workers in China — yes , human ones , to work alongside the robots .
`` I would n't be surprised if sometime in the next five years , robots will even take care of the final touches , '' said Bajarin .
Some analysts see this trend toward robotics transforming labor markets globally . Marshall Brain , founder of How Stuff Works and author of Robotic Nation , says the push towards automation is happening much faster than people realize . `` Within a couple of decades , '' said Brain in an interview , `` there wo n't be a single job that robots ca n't do better than humans . ''
But phasing out human labor altogether is easier said than done . Foxconn 's original commitment to implement one million robots by 2014 has hit its fair share of roadblocks . By 2011 , the company had reportedly rolled out 10,000 robots to work in their Jincheng , Shanxi Province factory , but several production line workers complained that the machines were incapable of doing the most basic human tasks .
Known as `` Foxbots , '' the machines were part of a larger effort to help offset increasing labor costs . Hon Hai 's 2013 financial report stated , in part , `` To remain cost competitive , we have been continuously controlling manufacturing overhead to attain better operating leverage and improving efficiency and yield rate through automation using robot arms and industrial engineering methods like production cell management . ''
The shift to automation will undoubtedly lead to substantial productivity gains for companies , but as that happens , jobs will be increasingly at risk .
`` We have been dealing with robots on manufacturing lines for almost 50 years , said Bajarin . `` The fact that they are getting faster , smarter , and able to do more intricate tasks is a concern in the sense — as it was 50 years ago — that it impacts job creation . ''
Larry Summers , former U.S. Treasury secretary during the Clinton Administration and former head of Obama 's National Economic Council , predicts technology will have a profound effect on the average employee . `` We are seeing less and less opportunity for what average people — people lacking in certain skills — are going to be able to do , '' said Summers in May at the Conference on Inclusive Capitalism .
`` It is not true that innovation always makes more employment…There is nothing in the logic of the market or human experience to suggest that it must necessarily be so that there will be jobs for all at acceptable wages , no matter how technology evolves . ''
Job-killing technology is hardly new . From 2000 to 2010 , over a million secretary jobs were eliminated from the U.S. labor market as answering machines and computers replaced them at lower costs . But robots could put the trend into overdrive . Now , people may not have to worry about their job going to someone overseas , but to something right down the street .
`` Right now , there 's a big process of automating all of the warehouses in the United States . It used to be you had people running around picking stuff out of warehouses and putting them in warehouses , '' said Brain in an interview . `` That whole process is going to be pretty much completely automated within the next couple of years . No one really pays attention to it because warehouses are n't in places we normally go . But that 's going to happen . ''
Producing some of Apple 's products is already an almost completely automated system . In 2013 , the company began producing its Mac Pro at the Flextronics Americas factory in Northwest Austin . They may get to engrave `` Made in USA '' on their products , but some argue it does more harm than good . `` It 's located in Texas , which makes everybody feel good , '' said Brain , `` but it 's not providing any jobs . ''
It makes geography , and the debate about outsourcing jobs , almost entirely insignificant . `` If robots are taking more and more of the manufacturing jobs , '' said Bajarin , `` it actually does n't matter whether it 's here or in Asia . ''
Brain predicts the trend is heading in this direction globally — and beyond low-skill factory work .
Indeed , Foxconn is n't just in the business of putting labels on chicken soup cans . They recently manufactured a robot in Japan that might serve as more of a companion at home than as a coworker on the assembly line . Designed by French robotics company Aldebaran , it 's a semi-humanoid robot named `` Pepper , '' who is reportedly equipped with some social skills , too . In a twist worthy of the movie She , where a man falls in love with a computer generated `` friend , '' Pepper has an `` emotion engine '' that can reportedly understand human emotion , interpret it , and react accordingly .
Japanese telecom giant SoftBank commissioned the construction of Pepper , and plans to sell what they refer to as `` the newest member of the SoftBank crew '' in Japan next February . The price tag for your newest 1.2 meter tall little friend ? Just under $ 2,000 .
SoftBank was built on the philosophy of 'Information Revolution – Happiness for everyone . ' `` To realize our vision , '' said SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son in a statement , `` We have made a new entry into the robot business with the aim of developing affectionate robots that make people smile . ''
Of course , many doubt workers will be smiling when those robots take their jobs .

Fundraiser for Gaza hospital to be held in Dearborn
A fundraising drive for the Shifa hospital and other humanitarian causes in Gaza is to be held at Riverside Academy , 7124 Miller Road in Dearborn , on Saturday Jan. 10 at 5 p.m .
The group Palestinian Unity organized the effort . Funds are to be sent to Gaza through the Palestinian Aid Society , www.palestineaidsociety.org for medical aid and ten group Islamic Relief , www.irw.org , for humanitarian aid .
According to aid workers , doctors in Gaza are struggling to treat the injured and are lacking essential medical supplies . Gaza 's 1.5 million residents were already facing the region 's worst humanitarian crisis in 30 years before the current crisis , exacerbated by the limited mobility of aid workers , depleted supplies and a massive increase of those in critical need .
California-based aid organization Islamic Relief has launched a multi-million dollar humanitarian appeal to ease suffering in the ongoing crisis . The group has an established , internationally recognized office and staff in Gaza able to provide medicine and food aid .
“ The children are terrified . Adults are unable to provide them with security or warmth . Hospitals are stretched out of the limits . We need blood and medicine and surgical equipment , ” said Eyad El-Sarraj , director of the Gaza Community Mental Health Program .
Other fundraising efforts through Islamic Relief and other groups are being organized locally .

JetBlue , TSA officials pay $ 240,000 settlementJetBlue Airways and two Transportation Security Authority officials have paid out $ 240,000 to the Iraqi-born blogger Raed Jarrar , who sued after they were stopped from boarding a JetBlue flight at JFK Airport because they were wearing a t-shirt that said “ We will not be silent ” in both Arabic and English .
Last year , the American Civil Liberties Union and the New York Civil Liberties Union filed a federal civil rights lawsuit on Jarrar 's behalf .
ACLU attorney Aden Fine said , “ This settlement should send a clear message to all TSA officials and airlines that they can not discriminate against passengers based on their race or the ethnic content of their speech . ”
The settlement was announced just days after the airline AirTran removed a Muslim family of nine heading to Orlando . AirTran refused to let the family fly on the airline even after they were questioned and cleared by the FBI .

Why Scientists Think Salvia Could Lead To Medical Treatments
A few weeks ago , I wrote a post about Salvinorin A . It 's the chemical that gives the herb Salvia divinorum its hallucinogenic kick . My news peg at the time was not Miley Cyrus ' experimentation with the drug , but a scientific paper evaluating the drug 's toxicity . Turns out that if you can tolerate the intense hallucinations , the drug appears to be relatively harmless .
Johns Hopkins School of Medicine researcher Matthew W. Johnson , the paper 's author , said they did n't conduct the research to reassure Miley and their drug-dabbling friends about the safety of their fun and games , but because compounds similar to Salvinorin A might someday be used as therapies . That got me wondering just what kind of therapy it might provide .
Salvinorin A activates something called the kappa opioid receptors . When turned on , opiod receptors are responsible for the high you get from drugs like heroin and opium . But opium and heroin work by stimulating the mu opiod receptors .
The kappa receptors have been referred to as the mu receptors ' evil cousin , because when activated they elicit depression . That 's not a particularly desirable quality in a party drug , but potentially valuable as a therapeutic .
How ? A drug that activates the kappa opiod receptors might be used to control the mania of manic depression . Activating the kappa receptors also seems to eliminate pain . Find a chemical cousin of Salvinorin A that does n't get into the brain , and you might have a powerful new analgesic .
Someone sees potential in this approach . At least three patents have been issued on Salvinorin A-related compounds .
Even though causing hallucinations is a drawback for Salvinorin A as a therapeutic , Bryan Roth sees it as a potential boon for neuroscientists . He 's a pharmacology professor at the University of North Carolina . `` One of the things that 's interesting about drugs that are hallucinogens is they alter the way we see reality , '' they say . Studying how Salvinorin A effects brain circuits may provide clues about how the brain makes sense of the world . That 's a question worth pursuing , in Roth 's opinion . `` What could be more important than how we view reality ? ''
Ca n't argue with that .
A former psychiatrist who practised in Halifax and taught at Dalhousie University has been charged with a child pornography offence .
Dr. Curtis Steele , 82 , is charged with printing and publishing child pornography . The alleged offence took place 11 years ago , between January and December 2004 .
They are expected to answer to the charges on June 16 . In the meantime , Steele has been ordered to stay away from schools , playgrounds and can have no unsupervised contact with children under the age of 16 .
Steele practiced in Nova Scotia between 1988 and 2013 .
They gave up their licence to practise after complaints to the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Nova Scotia and a disciplinary hearing last year determined they had taken nude photographs of a 14-year-old female patient they were treating in 2003 .
The decision from the college said one of the girl 's parents worked with Steele and considered them a friend .
A committee that investigated the complaint found a number of concerns about Steele 's behaviour , including the allegations that Steele took the photos of their 14-year-old patient , as well as prescribing the drug Paxil without a supporting diagnosis .
The college received a second complaint from a woman who said Steele also took their picture while treating them in 2003 . They were 14 at the time .
Steele agreed to the terms of the college 's settlement to stop practising medicine and never apply for a licence again .
They were also handed a $ 5,000 fine last year to help cover the college 's costs of the investigation . Steele admitted to professional misconduct , but not necessarily the facts outlined in the agreement .
Steele was also a faculty member at Dalhousie University 's Department of Psychiatry , but retired in 2013 . They had n't taught medical students in over a decade , Dalhousie spokesperson Allison Gerrard told CBC News last year .
Majority Floor Leader Jim Stamas , R-Midland , made the decision to prevent Brown and Byrum from speaking on any of the slew of bills the House was racing to pass before adjourning for the summer .
[ ... ]
`` My concern was the decorum of the House , not of anything they said , '' Stamas told The Detroit News .
`` I ask all members to maintain a decorum of the House , and I felt it went too far yesterday , '' they said .
Speaker Pro Tem John Walsh , R-Livonia , gaveled Brown out of order for saying `` no means no '' — because it suggested Brown was comparing the abortion legislation to rape , House GOP spokesperson Ari Adler said .
`` It has nothing to do with the word vagina , '' Adler said .
” I have not asked you to adopt and adhere to my religious beliefs . Why are you asking me to adopt yours ? And finally , Mr. Speaker , I 'm flattered that you 're all so interested in my vagina , but no means no . ”
`` What they said was offensive . It was so offensive , I do n't even want to say it in front of women . I would not say that in mixed company . `` .
PHOENIX -- The chairperson of the Arizona Republican Party said he 's `` very happy '' with their top spokesperson who bashed a pair of female critics this week for having a , `` bitch session . ''
Tom Morrissey said he 'd never use the phrase personally , but backed their spokesperson , Shane Wikfors , who used it to criticize a columnist for the Arizona Republic and another woman .
`` He did n't call anyone a bitch , '' Morrissey said this afternoon in a telephone interview . `` He used the term bitch session . ''
Morrissey , who took over the party last year , says their spokesperson did n't intend to demean women and that , “ sometimes people make mistakes . ''
`` Keep the hate coming lefties ( who do n't bother to read ) ''
[ Content Note : misogynist language , actions , & apologia ] Who could forget yesterday 's news about the silencing of women by men because the women dared to question , to disagree very publicly , with them ? Well , we have a couple updates.1 . In Michigan , the republicans are saying no , no it 's not because of vagina Rep. Brown was silenced , it 's because they used the phrase `` no means no '' . AS IF THAT MAKES IT ANY BETTER ( hint : it does not ) .Rep . Brown , in their remarks , first introduced the fact that in the Jewish faith , Jewish law that places the life of the mother over that of a fetus . No matter how where in gestation the pregnancy is . Then went onto say : To which they were censored and their colleagues , such as Rep. Mike Callton ( R-Nashville ) , had this sort of response:2 . Arizona 's Republican Party Communications Director Shane Wikfors definitely does not have anything to fear about their job , no matter what they say about two women engaging in a discussion over dissatisfaction with the republican party . Their boss thinks he 's awesome : That 's right . They make `` mistakes '' and then , naturally , take to Twitter to tweet things like The very model of professional & charming all-around , that one.So , to recap : '' Vagina '' , `` No Means No '' = `` inappropriate '' , `` offensive '' , `` against decorum '' '' Bitch session '' = Totally ok and not remotely unprofessional
Perched on the cliff edge near St. Agnes , the mines have been chosen alongside the likes of the Northern Lights , Sydney Harbour and the Taj Mahal .
The ruins of the structures which once housed them are a `` dramatic counterpoint '' to the rugged rocks and wild seas of Cornwall 's north coast , according to the list by CNN .
Around 3,000 engine houses were built in the 18th and 19th centuries but the last closed in the 1930s and the remains were declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2006 .
Visitors can walk heritage trails , go underground to see how the miners laboured , pan for minerals and gems or bike the 31-kilometre Cornwall Mineral Tramway trail .
CNN said : `` The tin mines may be closed , but the ruins of the structures which once housed them near St. Just make a thrillingly dramatic counterpoint to the rugged rocks and wild seas of Cornwall 's north coast .
The mines are among three places in Britain which made the list , just scraping in at number 27 .
Witnessing a starling murmuration at Brighton Pier made number two in the list , while the Lake District made it at number 24 .
Topping the list is Borobudur at sunrise in Java , Indonesia , with the Brighton starlings a close second .
Third is the Northern Lights in Scandinavia , followed closely by the great migration in East Africa .
The fifth and six spot is filled by the star-filled sky , in New Zealand and the Torres del Paine in Chile .
Morocco 's Djemaa el Fna is in seventh place and California 's Yosemite peaks is the eight must-see place to see before death .
Number nine is Santa Maria della Salute in Venice , the Jungle pyramids in Mexico is number ten and 11 is the electrical storm in Tornado Alley , USA .
The famous Sydney Harbour comes in at 12 , with the inside of Thrihnukagigur volcano in Iceland at 13 .
Number 14 is Monument Valley in the US and 15 is India 's Taj Mahal .
The Kasanka bat migration in Zambia , Carlsbad Cavern in America , Lunar rainbow in Zambia and Shubenacadie tidal bore in Canada take the 16,17,18 and 19 spots .
Cape Tribulation in Australia , Rock Face City of Petra in Jordan , Enrosadira in Italy and Fairy Chimneys in Turkey take up the spots from 20 to 23 .
England 's Lake District is at 24 , with the Sardine run in South Africa at 25 .
The last two spaces are filled by the pristine beaches of Islas Cies in Spain and finally , Cornwall 's ruined mines come in at 27 .
CNN said : `` There are some things you can see around the world that have the potential to give you photo-showing rights for decades .
`` We have n't got them all - in fact we barely scratched the surface . But we have picked out a few of the scenes that , if you 're lucky enough to witness them , will invariably leave you spellbound . ''
32 Observations , Week 3
By Nathan Jahnke • Sep 28 , 2017
Another week , another 32 Observations by Nathan Jahnke finding an interesting piece of information about all 32 teams after one week of football . If you would like to make some observations of your own , you can do so with PFF Elite , where you can find several signature statistics for every offensive and defensive position in football .
AFC EAST
Buffalo Bills : Linebacker Lorenzo Alexander has only rushed the passer on 58.6 percent of pass plays , but when they have he 's been effective . He 's gotten pressure on 24.4 percent of their pass-rushes , which is the third-highest rate for all defensive players with 40 or more pass rushes .
Miami Dolphins : While defensive end William Hayes has primarily been used as a run defender , when they have rushed the passer he 's been effective . He 's gotten pressure on one in every 4.2 pass-rushes which is the fourth-best rate for edge rushers in the league .
New England Patriots : Tight end Rob Gronkowski had 36 yards after the catch this week . That was the most for tight ends , putting them at 99 for the season which leads tight ends , and 2,943 for their career . This week they pass Greg Olsen for most YAC by a tight end over the last 12 years .
New York Jets : Rookie safety Jamal Adams had their second pass breakup this past week . They are just the seventh rookie safety in the PFF era to have two or more pass breakups over the first three weeks of the season . The most recent rookie safety to do the same was Landon Collins .
AFC NORTH
Baltimore Ravens : Defensive tackle Carl Davis played in 65.8 percent of snaps against the Jagaurs ; the most playing time for them in a game since being drafted by the Ravens in 2015 . On the season they have a run stop percentage of 20.0 percent which is the best for interior linemen this season .
Cincinnati Bengals : Prior to the 2017 season , in every game where wide receiver A.J . Green had two or more players miss tackles on their catches , he 's followed that up with a game where one or fewer defenders missed tackles on him . To begin the 2017 season , he 's had three straight games with two defenders missing tackles on them in each game .
Cleveland Browns : Second-year safety Derrick Kindred has eight run stops and an 11.3 run stop percentage . Both of those are the highest rates for safeties to start each game this season .
Pittsburgh Steelers : Defensive linemen Cameron Heyward has 15 pressures on the year after a two-pressure performance in Week 3 , which is tied for second-most with all interior defenders on the season .
AFC SOUTH
Houston Texans : Five different defenders on the Texans have six or more pressures , including J.J. Watt , D.J . Reader , Whitney Mercilus , Jadeveon Clowney and Benardrick McKinney . They are one of just four teams to have that many pass rushers with that many pressures .
Indianapolis Colts : Quarterback Jacoby Brissett has a career adjusted completion percentage of 77.8 percent . The only quarterbacks since 2006 with 100-plus attempts and a higher adjusted completion percentage are Teddy Bridgewater , Cody Kessler and Drew Brees .
Jacksonville Jaguars : Left guard Patrick Omameh did n't allow a pressure for the second straight week . Dating back to 2016 Week 10 , in 159 pass blocks he 's allowed just one pressure . Their 99.53 pass blocking efficiency over that time is the best for guards .
Tennessee Titans : Against Seattle , backup outside linebacker Erik Walden has a sack and two hurries . Dating back to the start of 2016 , Walden has converted 32.4 percent of their pressures into sacks which is the highest rate for edge defenders .
AFC WEST
Denver Broncos : Right guard Ron Leary is the only right guard to start every game and not allow a pressure this season . The only other guard to do the same is former teammate Zack Martin .
Kansas City Chiefs : Over the last eight weeks of regular season games , Travis Kelce has 2.62 yards per route run . That is by far the best for tight ends , with second-best having a mark of 2.23 , and nearly double the league average of 1.37 .
Los Angeles Chargers : Cornerback Trevor Williams has been thrown at just eight times on their 90 coverage snaps . He 's been thrown at one in every 11.3 of their coverage snaps , which makes them the third-most avoided cornerback in the league behind Patrick Peterson and Desmond Trufant .
Oakland Raiders : Center Rodney Hudson is the only center to start every game this season and not allow a pressure . Since the beginning of the 2016 season , they have n't allowed a sack or hit .
NFC EAST
Dallas Cowboys : Wide receiver Dez Bryant had two players miss tackles on their catches on Sunday night . That moved them to 82 for their career , which brings them up from 13th- to eighth-most in the PFF era .
New York Giants : Quarterback Eli Manning has attempted 87 passes where the time to throw on those passes was 2.5 or less . That is 11 more than any other quarterback . They have completed 67 of those passes for 613 yards with three touchdowns and three interceptions .
Philadelphia Eagles : All four of the Eagles starting defensive linemen have three or more sacks and hits combined . They are one of just two teams where each of the primary four pass rushers each have gotten to the quarterback that many times .
Washington : Over the last two seasons combined , Chris Thompson has avoided being tackled on first contact on 38.3 percent of their carries . That is the second-best rate for running backs in that time .
NFC NORTH
Chicago Bears : Running back Jordan Howard had 11 players miss tackles on their carries . It was just the 16th time in the last 12 years someone had 11 or more players miss tackles on a player rushing attempts .
Detroit Lions : Over the last two seasons combined , Ameer Abdullah has averaged 3.48 yards after contact per carry , second-best for all backs with 50 or more carries in that time .
Green Bay Packers : Safety Josh Jones had eight stops in their first NFL start last Saturday . It was just the 12th time in the last 12 years that a safety had eight or more stops in a game , joining the likes of Ronde Barber , Troy Polamalu and Eric Berry .
Minnesota Vikings : The new offensive tackle duo of Riley Reiff and Mike Remmers have allowed zero sacks , zero hits and 11 hurries on the season . Only the Vikings and Titans have n't allowed a sack by their offensive tackles this season .
NFC SOUTH
Atlanta Falcons : Cornerback Desmond Trufant has nine tackles and two assists on the season with no missed tackles . They are one of many cornerbacks this season not to miss a tackle yet . In their career he 's made 196 tackles with 13 assists , and only ten missed tackles . Their 21.9 tackling efficiency is the best for cornerbacks with at least 2000 snaps in the PFF era .
Carolina Panthers : When Luke Kuechly has been the man in coverage , opposing quarterbacks have an NFL passer rating of 54.5 . That is the lowest mark for any linebacker who has been thrown at ten or more times this season .
New Orleans Saints : Quarterback Drew Brees completed 2-of-3 deep passes for 66 yards and a touchdown this past week . That pushed their deep adjusted completion percentage up to 50.5 percent since 2006 . They are the only quarterback with more than 25 dropbacks since 2006 to have an adjusted completion percentage above 50 percent during that time .
Tampa Bay Buccaneers : After a five run stop performance against the Vikings , William Gholston has a run stop percentage of 19.1 percent on the season
NFC WEST
Arizona Cardinals : When safety Tyvon Branch has lined up across from a slot receiver on 31 pass plays . On those plays he 's been thrown at twice , and allowed one reception for a three-yard loss . They are the only defender with a negative yard per coverage snap in the slot .
Los Angeles Rams : Since joining the Rams , Andrew Whitworth has allowed just one pressure on 86 pass blocks . They are the only left tackle with more than 50 pass blocks and only one pressure allowed .
San Francisco 49ers : Over the last eight weeks of NFL regular season games , Pierre Garcon has 2.69 yards per route run , which is second best for wide receivers with 200 or more routes in that time .
Seattle Seahawks : Dating back to the start of the 2016 season , Bobby Wagner has 53 run stops . That is the most for any linebacker in the league .
Humans , along with most other vertebrates , yawn . It 's likely an ancient behavior with some adaptive advantages . Although we most often associate yawning with boredom or sleepiness , it may serve more than one function . For instance , humans and other animals yawn both when relaxed and when aroused , such as during a tense moment of conflict . And there is some evidence that animals yawn in anticipation of important events and during behavioral transitions ( such as between sleep and awake cycles ) .
With so many reasons to yawn , maybe it 's not surprising that different kinds of yawns can convey different messages .
Gelada baboons are Old World monkeys native to Ethiopia . They have three easily identifiable yawn types : yawns with covered teeth , yawns with uncovered teeth , and yawns with uncovered gums and head movements .
Researchers from the University of Parma and the University of Pisa in Italy observed a colony of geladas at NaturZoo in Rheine , Germany . They collected over 5,900 bouts of yawning , noting the social context in which the yawns occurred and the behaviors associated with the yawns . Their results were published in the February 6 issue of Scientific Reports .

The gum-bearing yawn was most common with males , especially high-ranking ones . This kind of yawn exposed the gelada 's impressive canine teeth , which stood out against the reddish-pink color of their gums and the inside of their mouths . It was often accompanied by a loud call , and the researchers believe the yawn functions as a long-distance display . Males used this yawn during periods of tension , such as the time right before feeding , suggesting it may serve to intimidate other geladas .
The other two less intense types of yawns were seen most in females during friendly interactions . The researchers found these yawns to be more contagious , and observed females mirroring the intensity of other females ' yawns . They believe these yawns are part of a complex communication system between geladas that often engage in friendly interactions . The contagiousness of the yawns in these contexts suggests the behavior might play a role in synchronizing the activity between two geladas , strengthening the emotional connection between them , or signaling the quality of their relationship .
Gelada males and females might use yawns differently , but all three types of yawn contribute to the smooth workings of gelada society ; they function to let everyone know who 's in charge and which geladas are friends .

Trump themselves provides the juiciest target for whisper campaigns this time around . Their two divorces alone , let alone their libertine life while a bachelor , is full of hair-raising material that would cause anyone who believes in family values to pause . Yet Trump 's sheer brazenness and shamelessness would make it hard to get very far with this sort of gossip . When attacked , he 's unlikely to retreat and might successfully fend off attacks by their openness .
One symptom of the havoc that Trump has wreaked with their rivals is that they 're still struggling to figure out how to attack him . No one is having a harder time than Jeb Bush . To give them due credit , Bush has stood out of the pack by constantly criticizing Trump , but he 's shown a tendency to focus on trivial non-issues that are easily brushed aside . Recently , Bush and their surrogates have zeroed in on Trump 's vulgar language . “ There are kids listening to this , for crying out loud , ” Bush complained .
It 's true that Trump 's open use of foul language is new to American politics . Even Nixon kept their profanities private , although they have since been revealed by White House tapes . And it might be that among the more prim , religious denizens of South Carolina , Trump will turn off people with their swearing . But it 's just as likely that Trump 's hardcore supporters love their salty language , seeing it as a mark of authenticity .
Bush , who needs to follow up their decent showing in New Hampshire with a much better one in South Carolina , would clearly love to take Trump down . But as their sniffing at swearing proves , Bush wants to continue to cast himself , as their father before him , as a genteel voice of respectable Republicanism . This facade of civility should n't hide the fact , however , that the Bushes have always been willing to use surrogates and front groups to launch the vilest sort of political attacks , ranging from the naked racism of the Willie Horton ad used against Michael Dukakis in 1988 to the McCain smear campaign in South Carolina to the personal vilification of the Swift Boat crusade against John Kerry in 2004 .
This year , who knows ? Maybe one of the Bush 's minions will revive an old tactic and whisper—this time quite truthfully—that Ben Carson has black children . More seriously , the jokes about Marco Rubio 's high-heeled booties could , in a proper whisper campaign , be used to suggest a fatal lack of manliness . Ted Cruz 's history with Goldman Sachs might create an opening , too , in a state where Newt Gingrich made great hay four years ago by casting Mitt Romney as a “ vulture capitalist . ”

A conservative billionaire and former president , Sebastián Piñera , has won Chile 's presidential election run-off .
Left-winger Alejandro Guillier conceded and congratulated their opponent on their win and their return to the presidency after a four-year gap .
With nearly all votes counted , Mr Piñera polled more than 54 % .
It is a clear move to the right for the country , which is currently led by socialist President Michelle Bachelet . They had backed Mr Guillier .
About 14 million were eligible to vote in the ballot , including , for the first time , Chileans living abroad .
However , voter turnout was low , at 48.5 % . It had been thought that a high turnout would favour Mr Guillier .
Mr Piñera called for unity after their victory :
`` Chile needs agreements more than confrontations , '' they said . `` The paths of the future unite us . Sometimes the stories of the past separate us . ''
Reaching out to their opponent , Mr Piñera added : `` I want to talk to them about the points we agree about . ''
Image copyright AFP/getty Image caption Mr Guillier recognised their `` harsh defeat '' in the election while congratulating their opponent
Billionaire business person Mr Piñera won the first round of votes by a large margin , when the number of candidates reduced from eight to two for a final run-off .
They have already governed the country from 2010 to 2014 , when they ended two decades of uninterrupted centre-left rule . But the former president and their Chile Vamos coalition had only a slim lead in the most recent opinion polls before Sunday 's election vote .
They had the support of the business community , promising to lower taxes to get the economy growing again .
During their campaign , they promised to rein in the reforms brought in by President Bachelet , while their opponent Mr Guillier , on the other hand , campaigned on the back of their legacy .
While President Bachelet 's progressive agenda has won plaudits abroad , their popularity plummeted during their second term , due in part to a 2015 corruption scandal involving their daughter-in-law .
This year , however , the president overcame conservative opposition to successfully ease Chile 's strict anti-abortion laws .
Conservative critics say Ms Bachelet pushed their reforms too far . They were unable to seek re-election under the country 's constitution .
Image copyright AFP/getty Image caption As votes closed , projections indicated a victory for Mr Piñera , causing celebration among their supporters
Mr Guillier represents six parties in a left-wing coalition . They beat former president Ricardo Lagos for the Socialist Party nomination in April 2017 , promising to continue Ms Bachulet 's reforms .
A decade ago , Argentina , Bolivia , Brazil , Chile , Cuba , Ecuador , Honduras , Nicaragua , Uruguay and Venezuela were all governed by left-wing leaders .
But in recent years , conservatives have come to power in Argentina , Brazil and Paraguay , and Venezuela 's `` Bolivarian Revolution '' has come under severe pressure with anti-government protesters taking to the streets for months . The win by Mr Piñera further consolidates that trend .
In order to address the financial exclusion of low- income earners , the Bank of Namibia ( BoN ) will introduce the Basic Bank Account ( BBA ) facility , The Villager has learnt .
The BBA will cut out the loopholes of inclusion in the financial sector as the latest statistics reveal that 31 % of the total population is unbanked .
However , the latest FinScope Survey of 2012 indicated that the level of financial inclusion increased to 69 % from the baseline of 48 per cent in 2007 .
Emma Haiyambo is the Acting Director of Strategic Communications and Financial Sector Development at BoN , and told The Villager that the introduction of the BBA with minimal charges is aimed to benefit low- income earners and is deemed as a pragmatic intervention to deal with financial exclusion .
They said in order to promote financial inclusion , it has been deemed necessary to address the issue of high fees and charges which have characterised the Namibian financial system .
“ High fees and charges contributed to the exclusion of the majority of society from participating in the formal financial system . In this regard , some specific standards were implemented to address this matter , ” Haiyambo stated .
According to her , all commercial banks have introduced the BBA , and thus the number of active basic bank accounts has been increasing .
In 2012 , the country launched the Financial Sector Strategy , a long-term development strategy which advocates for various reforms and initiatives in the financial sector , and includes the need to achieve financial inclusion .
Haiyambo said currently , the strategy is in full swing , with various steps already having been taken to enhance financial inclusion , which steps include consumer financial literacy and protection , and fostering access to financial services and products .
“ The other intervention was the Issued Standards on Cash Deposit Fees , which removed all cash deposit fees charged by banking institutions to all individual accounts , and accounts belonging to businesses with a turnover of N $ 1 million or less . This became effective from 31 March 2015 , ” Haiyambo said .
They added that in an effort to address the challenges to accessing finances by Small to Medium Enterprises ( SMEs ) , Credit Bureau regulations were gazetted in July 2014 .
These regulations were drafted in terms of the Bank of Namibia Act to regulate the operations of credit bureaus in Namibia , which regulations are now compelling lending institutions to provide credit performance information to registered credit bureaus .
“ Also , the Financial Literacy Initiative , a national platform to enhance financial education for individuals and small businesses , was launched to contribute to the narrowing of the financial exclusion gap through creating awareness of financial services and products . This is being carried out by the collaborating institutions who agreed , through signing a Memorandum of Understanding , to jointly design , fund and undertake targeted financial education and consumer protection initiatives in the country , ” Haiyambo said .
In order to ensure consumer protection , the code of banking practices and guidelines for lodging customer complaints by the BoN and Bankers ' Association of Namibia ( BAN ) was launched in 2013 .
“ There are also various initiatives being undertaken in partnership with other financial institutions to foster access to finances , especially for SMEs , which once successfully implemented , will significantly enhance financial inclusion , ” the official stated .
Haiyambo said the other reasons why there is still a population which is unbanked is because they might have a lack of income , and therefore people would not even open bank accounts .
“ For instance , due to socio-economic challenges such as unemployment , a significant percentage of the population might not have income , and consequently bank accounts . The other reason for a lack of accessibility to financial products and services could be due to the vast geographical set-up of the country . As such , many people residing in rural areas do not have access to financial services and products , though this situation has improved significantly as the number of bank branches had increased countywide in recent years . Mobile banking services have also been introduced in the country , ” they continued .
Isack Hamata is the Manager of Corporate Communications at the Namibia Financial Institutions ' Supervisory Authority ( NAMFISA ) , who said Namibia has the third-highest banking rate in the Southern African Development Community ( SADC ) after South Africa and Mauritius .
“ Our concern as a regulator is rather that although many Namibians have bank accounts , they are still not included in terms of participating in the ownership of financial institutions and owning investment accounts , ” they stated .
There 's a notorious production company called The Asylum . It 's not involved with gaming ( at least , not yet ) , but you might know the company as the folks behind such films as Transmorphers , The Day the Earth Stopped , Atlantic Rim , and Android Cop . Its modus operandi is making half-baked films -- mockbusters -- that clearly want to ride on the themes and popularity of much more visible properties , while trying to remain different enough that they are n't completely wholesale rip-offs of a source .
Why do I mention this ? Because Mind Zero feels like The Asylum 's version of the Persona series . The similarity of the setting , story concepts , and overall design is undeniable . And like the inept mockbuster trying desperately to re-create the spectacle of its bigger inspiration , Mind Zero fails at anything beyond being occasionally mediocre .
Leo 's standards are remarkably low .
The premise behind Mind Zero sounds familiar : in modern-day Saitama , Japan , mysterious happenings are afoot , with random people going on violent rampages due to a force called MIND . While the police are investigating these freak occurrences , a group of high school kids stumble into a portal to a strange alternate world where they are given weapons and told the secrets of MINDs : they are parallel beings from another world . Some MINDs are leaking out into the world we know and are preying on people with negative emotions , and it 's up to a scrappy team of kids ( plus a grizzled supernatural detective ) to investigate and stop the MINDs from opening doors from their world to ours , all while keeping their special powers a secret from the police .
Sound a bit familiar ? It might , because it 's basically the plot of all of the various Persona games stitched together like some sort of Frankenstein 's monster . And much like said creature , Mind Zero 's plot trudges along with the speed of molasses for a good chunk of the game . Even in the most cinematic-heavy Japanese role-playing games , there are usually things developing in the story when you 're not dungeon-crawling . Mind Zero takes its sweet time just getting past the basic `` MINDs are bad ; let 's find and fight them '' conceit into something more substantial .
But while other RPGs might emphasize interactions between characters to help make up for a weak main plot , Mind Zero gives you a cast of teenagers whose personalities fall into one of two categories : incredibly irritating all the time or about as well defined and interesting as a brick . The lead character , Kei , is so aloof and angsty that they may as well have been a mass-produced unit purchased straight from JRPG Hero Stereotype Industries Inc . It was n't long after my introduction to them that I was wishing I could have a silent lead this time .
Mind Zero 's plot trudges along with the speed of molasses for a good chunk of the game .
Other characters have one-note traits and are easily summed up in single sentences : `` He wo n't shut up ever about buying dumb crap , '' `` She 's kind of stupid in a way that 's supposed to be endearing but is n't , '' `` She has no discernible personality to speak of , but they fight stuff , so she 's OK , '' and so on . The game 's most interesting characters end up being Ogata , the grizzled detective and sole adult on your team , and the antagonists that emerge later on . The sheer dullness or unlikability of everyone makes the game 's attempts to present short vignettes of interaction between characters ( akin to Persona 's social-link sequences ) laughable .
The combat and exploration are better than the story , though that 's not really saying much . Dungeons are presented as first-person-view mazes , and a map fills out as you explore , making things much easier for you -- especially since the dungeons become quite expansive , quite fast . What they never really become , however , is attractive . The visuals for these settings are bland and uninspired ( the fact that setting assets are recycled by the third major dungeon is seriously off-putting ) , and the layout of the mazes is sprawling and confusing , with only a few uninteresting gimmicks to break up the monotony .
Combat , however , has a few interesting elements . Up to three characters can participate in combat , and they have three separate meters each : life points , mind points , and technical points . Life points are pretty easy to grasp : lose them all , and the character is out of commission . Mind points determine the health of a character 's MIND ; these points recover over time unless the MIND is on-field . Finally , technical points are used to activate skills of MINDs . They also recover over the course of combat .
Combat is initially a high point , but becomes a real slog .
These gauges are all very important to keep track of , because they all affect the most crucial element of combat in Mind Zero : the usage of the MINDs , which are summoned with the R trigger . Characters have differing sets of commands depending on whether or not their MINDs are active on the field : defense , item , and escape commands can only be used sans a MIND , while skills are only available with MINDs summoned . MINDs alter other elements as well . Normally , whenever characters are attacked by enemies , they lose LP . However , if their MINDs are active when characters are hit , they lose MP instead of LP , thus rendering MINDs as something of a protective shield . If all MP is lost to attacks , however , characters ' MINDs are broken , and the characters are stunned and unable to summon their MINDs again for a few turns . This adds an element of risk to simply putting one 's MIND out as a meatshield against enemies .
Active MINDs improve standard attack power slightly and give access to skills , which consume TP and sometimes LP when used . The number of skills that can be equipped is determined by a character 's level , and skill-granting cards can be equipped , enhanced , and shuffled about from character to character outside of combat . Assembling a solid skill set is crucial to success , though the skills ' interchangeability robs characters of individual combat importance , so you 'll tend to focus on leveling up a few characters , which may come back to bite you at certain story points . Finally , there 's the burst command , which can be used with MINDs turned on or off . Burst allows for a command to be executed instantaneously at a significant TP cost -- it 's an expensive godsend when emergency healing , absolute escape , or immediate fatal damage on a foe is needed .
That pretty much says it all .
All of these aspects to fighting seem as if they should be great , and there are boss battles where the combat elements get a chance to shine . The problem comes from the sheer tedium of the regular enemy encounters , and the constant difficulty spikes that accompany them . There 's really no such thing as a quick battle in Mind Zero : enemies not only soak up and deal a lot of damage ( even on the lowest difficulty ) , but they also have elemental and anti-MIND affiliations that you must pay attention to .
It 's one thing for random RPG battles to require you to at least pay attention to not suffer an embarrassing death , but the amount of command shuffling , MIND toggling , and bursting just to kill some cannon-fodder is downright annoying , especially when you just want to explore and get somewhere . Making it all worse is the massive difficulty spike that arrives with each new dungeon ; you 'll be finishing many fights by the skin of your teeth until you can eke out a couple of extra levels for your crew each time there 's a new location introduced . After just a few hours in , you grow to loathe the random encounters ( and the irritating music that accompanies them ) , but at least you 'll be thankful for the R button fast-forward feature to make them slightly less of a pain .
There are a few high points beyond good combat ideas : the artwork for the MINDs and characters is nice , and the localization gives conversations a natural flow , but the snoozefest of a story and monotonous encounters make playing Mind Zero feel like work . To top it all off , the finale is atrocious , failing to deliver any answers to the questions the story poses ( and , in fact , creating new ones ) , all while suggesting a follow-up that may or may not ever happen . After the utterly laborious process of completing the game , the unsatisfying finale is a slap in the face . But hey , at least you get a post-game dungeon to slog through !
The Vita is n't hurting for JRPGs , but even if you 've already played and finished Demon Gaze , Ys : Memories of Celceta , and Persona 4 Golden , it 's best to skip Mind Zero . Like The Asylum 's film oeuvre , Mind Zero is capable , at times , of at least holding your attention , but it 's rarely entertaining , and when you 're done , you 'll be wondering why you did n't invest your time in a superior alternative instead .
Labour MP Jess Phillips is no stranger to the press . As well as being a frequent , vocal critic of Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn , they wrote an article for the Guardian painting their colleague Laura Pidcock as naive for considering Tory MPs the enemy of their constituents . They wrote a bizarre article for The New Statesman , in which they told how brilliant Labour 's conference was – until they are n't there any more .
And they gave a lengthy interview to the Murdoch-owned Times in which they complained that “ Labour under Corbyn feels like I 've been locked out of my home ” . They have also been a prominent campaigner for gender equality .
In spite of their feeling ‘ locked out ' , Ms Phillips is the Chair of the Women 's PLP ( parliamentary Labour party ) , having ousted Dawn Butler from the role earlier this year .
Labour sources have told the SKWAWKBOX that Ms Phillips missed last night 's weekly PLP meeting – at which Ms Butler spoke about the party 's gender audit .
Ms Phillips later attended what the Politico website called ‘ the party of the night ' – a private event thrown by Rupert Murdoch at their penthouse apartment :
Every other name listed among what the author calls “ a who 's who of parliament 's rising stars ” is a Tory MP . Perhaps surprisingly for an avid Twitter user , Ms Phillips does not appear to have tweeted about the ‘ bash ' .
The SKWAWKBOX contacted Ms Phillips for comment . They explained that they missed the PLP meeting to attend a meeting with a government minister to discuss a number of topics , including sexual harassment .
However , they did not so far respond to questions about the appropriateness of a Labour MP attending a party thrown by the owner of publications that routinely attack them party , about their relationship with Ms Butler or about whether it 's routine to miss the weekly PLP meeting to meet ministers .

This article will not restore your faith in humanity . Nor will it amaze , stun , delight , shock , charm , or in any literal or figurative way , blow your mind . What it will do—hopefully in a clear and intelligent way—is explained why people continually fall for clickbait . You know , like you just did a few seconds ago .
Whether you think it 's on the rise , obscurant and self-negating , not such a big deal , or the root of all evil , one thing is clear about clickbait : It 's increasingly hard to pin down . Some , like Buzzfeed 's Ben Smith , narrowly define it as an article that does n't deliver on its headline 's promise . Others think it means vapid listicles , quizzes , and Betteridge 's Law headlines . And then there are those who simply use it as shorthand for stuff they do n't like on the Internet .
Here 's what most people can agree on : Clickbait is annoying , but by god , it works—even when readers recognize it for what it is . The word 's substantial semantic drift may be behind some of this effectiveness . But a hefty helping of behavioral science is at play , too . As a number of new studies confirm , you can blame your clickbait habit on two things : the outsized role emotion plays in your intuitive judgements and daily choices , and your lazy brain .
Manufacturing Emotion
Clickbait does n't just happen on its own . Editors write headlines in an effort to manipulate you—or at least grab your attention—and always have . `` Headless Body In Topless Bar , '' and `` Sticks Nix Hick Pix '' would n't exist if publications did n't care about attracting eyeballs . The difference with clickbait is you 're often aware of this manipulation , and yet helpless to resist it . It 's at once obvious in its bait-iness , and somehow still effective bait .
This has a lot to do with emotion and the role it plays in our daily decision-making processes , says Jonah Berger , who studies social influence and contagion at the University of Pennsylvania . Emotional arousal , or the degree of physical response you have to an emotion , is a key ingredient in clicking behaviors . Sadness and anger , for example , are negative emotions , but anger is much more potent . `` It drives us , fires us up , and compels us to take action , '' Berger says . If you 've ever found yourself falling for outrage clickbait or spent time hate-reading and hate-watching something , you know what Berger is talking about . `` Anger , anxiety , humor , excitement , inspiration , surprise—all of these are punchy emotions that clickbait headlines rely on , '' they say .
A growing body of research supports this idea . In a recent paper called `` Breaking the News : First Impressions Matter On Online News , '' two researchers looked at 69,907 headlines produced by four international media outlets in 2014 . After analyzing the sentiment polarity of these headlines ( whether the primary emotion conveyed was positive , negative , or neutral ) , they found `` an extreme sentiment score obtained the largest mean popularity . '' This not only suggests that strongly negative or strongly positive news tends to attract more readers , they concluded , but also that `` a headline has more chance to [ receive clicks ] if the sentiment expressed in its text is extreme , towards the positive or the negative side . ''
Mind the Curiosity Gap
Promising a hilarious or mind-blowing experience using hyperbole and superlatives ( even when the subject clearly does n't warrant such language ) is one way to attract clicks . Another is to provoke curiosity . Upworthy articles are particularly good at this and psychologists have a few theories why .
One of the more popular and enduring ones comes from Carnegie Mellon 's George Loewenstein . In the mid-1990s , Loewenstein came up with what they called the `` information-gap '' theory . It basically holds that whenever we perceive a gap “ between what we know and what we want to know , ” that gap has emotional consequences . `` Such information gaps produce the feeling of deprivation labeled curiosity , '' they wrote . `` The curious individual is motivated to obtain the missing information to reduce or eliminate the feeling of deprivation . ''
In other words , not knowing is cognitively uncomfortable . Historically , this is the thinking behind Upworthy-style `` what happens next '' headlines : `` Someone Gave Some Kids Some Scissors . Here 's What Happened Next '' or `` These Workers Just Want Money , And You Wo n't Believe What They Did To Get Some . '' You can make people even more curious , say social psychologists , by presenting them with something they know a little bit about , but not too much .
Numbers and Lists
Umberto Eco famously claimed that humans are drawn to lists because we 're afraid to die . Psychologists agree . Sort of . As many studies show , lists do a number of things extremely well from a cognitive standpoint , including helping us `` face infinity and attempt to grasp the incomprehensible . '' Here 's a brief list of reasons list headlines are so effective :
They often use numbers , and numbers stand out when we 're scrolling through an endless stream of headlines—particularly odd numbers . Those numbers also help quantify story length and hint at the amount of attention ( not much ) we 'll need to deploy to read the story . They organize information spatially , which is how our brains like information . They feel good , existentially , because they eliminate ( or at least downplay ) the `` paradox of choice , '' presenting in its stead the illusion of certainty .
The takeaway here are that lists ultimately help create an easier reading ( and thinking ) experience . And there are few things your brain appreciates more than cognitive ease . As Kahneman writes , `` easy is a sign that things are going well—no threats , no major news , no need to redirect attention or mobilize effort . '' `` The 15 Reasons Why You Ca n't Resist List Headlines '' promises a pre-defined endpoint and makes the world seem comprehensible . Lists banish mental heavy lifting , complexity , and ambiguity . Click .
Anticipation Is Making You Click
So clickbait employs a number of effective cognitive tricks to get clicks . Fine . But even if readers rely on emotion and cognitive ease when choosing headlines , that still does n't explain why clickbait continues to work . Fool-me-once logic should mean that their effectiveness goes down as exposure goes up . How many cheap emotional ploys , false promises , and empty listicles and quizzes can a person endure ? A lot , it turns out .
Research has shown that humans are quite willing to put up with massive amounts of disappointment and frustration so long as there 's an occasional payout . And yes , sometimes clickbait does deliver these payouts … in spectacular fashion .
Consider the following headline : `` These 9 Unlikely Animal BFFs Will Brighten Your Day and Melt Your Heart . '' There are hundreds of variations of it online—many of them better from a clickbait POV—but you get the idea . We 're talking baby wombats hugging baby kangaroos , maybe some tiny snow leopard kittens playing with fox cubs , that sort of thing .
It 's well established that humans are pre-programmed cute seekers . To our brains ' pleasure centers , there 's little difference between looking at cute animals and consuming sugar or having sex . Indeed , the same neurotransmitter , dopamine , is involved in all three behaviors . That dopamine can manipulate our behavior is n't news . But the chronology of this process is important when you 're trying to decode clickbait 's effectiveness .
Think of those nine adorable animal pics as a reward ( your brain certainly does ) . Now think of that clickbait headline as a signal , an imminent sign you 're about to see some super-adorbz animal buddies . Lastly , think of the actual clicking of the link as the work you have to do to get that outcome . See headline , click hyperlink , receive super-cute reward . Easy .
You might assume our brains get that wonderful squirt of dopamine after we get the reward ( the pics ) , but it turns out dopamine levels go up much sooner—when we see the signal . That effectively means the headline itself is what gave you pleasure—not for what it was , mind you , but for what it represented ( impending cuteness in 3…2…1 ) .
Stanford neuroscientist Robert Sopolsky summarizes the finding this way : `` Dopamine is not about pleasure ; it 's about the anticipation of pleasure . It 's about the pursuit of happiness rather than happiness itself . ''
Happiness in Slavery
What 's really interesting is what happens when you reduce the reward frequency . When it comes only 50 percent of the time , dopamine levels go through the roof . In this sense , a violated promise is n't a deterrent for clicking behavior , but rather an incentive . As Sopolsky says , `` you 've just introduced the word 'maybe ' into the equation , and maybe is addictive like nothing else out there . '' Psychologists call this intermittent reinforcement , and it basically means that one of the most effective ways to get a specific behavior out of a person is to introduce `` perhaps '' into the equation .
Now obviously not all clickbait can—or even attempts to—manipulate our dopamine levels . But given its involvement in emotional arousal , it 's fair to say it does factor . This complicates the overpromise/underdeliver argument many people used to predict clickbait 's waning effectiveness . Indeed , on a rational level you may know that the adorable girl in this Clickhole video is right : you 'll still feel alone no matter how many videos you watch or how many lists you read . But behavioral science also suggests that reading about the 25 most awkward cat sleeping positions can also be an effective , if ever so brief , antidote to your existential isolation .

This set was recorded live at Re : Generate , the name chosen by the Om Reunion Project to set the mood for their summer solstice gathering in 2011 . I was scheduled to play on Sunday morning at the Moon Bass stage , a great little setup in a forest clearing on a beautiful piece of land in Southern Ontario . It felt like the right space and time to take a trip into the history of the psychedelic trance subculture so I mixed up a diverse assortment of old school Goa trance classics after sunrise . As always , this set was completely improvised ; absolutely nothing was planned prior to stepping on stage to ready my equipment . This musical experience was co-created with a fantastic crowd of people who emerged from the woods to dance with enthusiasm to these old school gems .

Oh wow , I really wish I knew your username so I could thank you in person ! ! ! ( I do n't see it anywhere and it was n't on the shipping label ... please comment or PM me if this was you ! I would love to send you thank-you cards ! )
I teach in rural Alaska , in a town of 200 people . It 's off the road system and accessible only by bush-plane . Getting supplies into town is hard , and the cost of shipping is a bitch . Because of this , I was n't even sure I would get matched with anyone . They or they might have given up because the package took a wicked long time to get here ... BUT IT DID !
Demo-wise , my kids are poor , mostly Native Alaskan . Lots of them are being raised by grandparents . They are wild and crazy and ( as you will soon see ) cute as hell .
Our awesome donor gave 65 ( ! ! ! ! ! ! ) robotic toy bugs ( known as HEXbugs ) to my class of preschool through second grade kids . We do n't have a lot of cool supplies for science , so we are definitely going to use these for a unit on experimentation -- I 'm thinking building mazes and seeing how fast the HEXbugs can move through them .
Thank you , thank you so much . My kids are freaking STOKED . We also had a nice talk about donation and about someone who does n't know them ( which blows their mind because they live in a town where everybody knows everybody ) was nice enough to send them cool toys to use in class . I am going to let them each have one once the unit is over , as well .
Here is a link to the kids playing with them :
The 14-year-old girl conceded that Clinton was a 'womanizer , ' but brushed it off – although their mom was slower to dismiss concerns about the famous political
Former U.S. President Bill Clinton made their first solo campaign appearance in support of their wife 's White House bid on Monday in Nashua , New Hampshire , but the female voters standing behind them on stage – and one eighth-grader – were stone-faced and unimpressed .
They stood on risers through their 28-minute speech at Nashua Community College , alternating between frowns , grimaces and eye-rolls , even looking uninterested as they applauded a few of Clinton 's lines .
While a largely appreciative audience hung on Bill 's every word , an elderly woman at the edge of the stage cast their eyes downward and looked like they were having trouble staying awake .
And a young woman standing in the back against a Hillary 'Fighting for us ' backdrop closed their eyes for significant stretches of time as TV cameras rolled and a girl in front of them scowled and fought off a yawn .
The New Hampshirites standing on stage with Bill were all smiles as they were introduced , but quickly seemed bored once they began talking .

LUKEWARM : There was a less than ecstatic round of applause for the would-be president 's husband
Two of the glum-looking females , a mother-daughter pair , spoke to Daily Mail Online after Clinton wrapped up their remarks . They said they were shocked to know how apathetic they looked on television .
'We were n't aware . I was n't aware ! ' said Deanne Martin , a surgical nurse stood on stage behind their 14-year-old daughter Mary .
' I 've never been to one of these before , ' they offered as they gave permission for their child to be interviewed .
Mary was even more shocked , mouthing an 'Oh , no ! ' at the news of their apparent detachment .
The young girl said someone from the Clinton campaign recruited them and their mom to stand behind Bill .
'We were nervous , ' they explained , and then abruptly shifted into the role of enthusiastic Hillary supporter .
' I was ecstatic ! ' the girl insisted , quickly painting on a go-getter 's grin , even though pictures told a different story .
' I want to be the first female president – well , now the second , ' they said .

TV IS FOREVER : CNN 's camera caught one girl in the back row looking at the backs of their eyelids while Clinton spoke
DailyMail.com delicately asked Deanne if they have told their daughter about Bill 's reputation with women during their White House years .
Young Mary jumped in and cut their mom off with a 'so what ' shrug .
'Oh , I 'm aware , ' they said . 'Yeah . He 's a womanizer . '
' I think that that 's their social life , ' the eighth-grader said of the famous political Lothario . 'And their work should be separate from that . '
Asked if they agreed , Deanne rolled their eyes left , then right , and sighed .
'Um – I guess , ' they said at last .
Past allegations of sexual abuse leveled against Bill have become campaign fodder on the political right as Republican front-runner Donald Trump has declared that Hillary 's status as an 'enabler ' makes the subject reasonable ground to cover during a presidential campaign .

Butler|Philbrick|Gordillo and Associates ' argue in Valuation Based Equity Market Forecasts – Q1 2013 Update that “ there is substantial value in applying simple statistical models to discover average estimates of what the future may hold over meaningful investment horizons ( 10+ years ) , while acknowledging the wide range of possibilities that exist around these averages . ”
Butler|Philbrick|Gordillo use linear regression to examine several variations of the Shiller PE ( and other cyclically adjusted PE ratios over periods ranging from one to 30 years ) , Tobin 's q ratio and Buffett 's total market capitalization-to-gross national product ratio ( “ TMC/GNP ” ) . They have analyzed the power of each measure to explain inflation-adjusted stock returns including reinvested dividends over subsequent multi-year periods , setting their findings out in the following matrix :
Matrix 1 . Explanatory power of valuation/future returns relationships
Source : Shiller ( 2013 ) , DShort.com ( 2013 ) , Chris Turner ( 2013 ) , World Exchange Forum ( 2013 ) , Federal Reserve ( 2013 ) , Butler|Philbrick|Gordillo & Associates ( 2013 ) .
Butler|Philbrick|Gordillo comment :
Matrix 1. contains a few important observations . Notably , over periods of 10-20 years , the Q ratio , very long-term smoothed PE ratios , and market capitalization / GNP ratios are equally explanatory , with R-Squared ratios around 55 % . The best estimate ( perhaps tautologically given the derivation ) is derived from the price residuals , which simply quantify how extended prices are above or below their long-term trend.The worst estimates are those derived from trailing 12-month PE ratios ( PE1 in Matrix 1 above ) . Many analysts quote ‘ Trailing 12-Months ' or TTM PE ratios for the market as a tool to assess whether markets are cheap or expensive . If you hear an analyst quoting the market 's PE ratio , odds are they are referring to this TTM number . Our analysis slightly modifies this measure by averaging the PE over the prior 12 months rather than using trailing cumulative earnings through the current month , but this change does not substantially alter the results.As it turns out , TTM ( or PE1 ) Price/Earnings ratios offer the least information about subsequent returns relative to all of the other metrics in our sample . As a result , investors should be extremely skeptical of conclusions about market return prospects presented by analysts who justify their forecasts based on trailing 12-month ratios .
Butler|Philbrick|Gordillo note : Our analysis provides compelling evidence that future returns will be lowed when starting valuations are high , and that returns will be higher in periods where starting valuations are low .
So where are we now ? Table 1 below from the post provides a snapshot of some of the results from Butler|Philbrick|Gordillo 's analysis . The table shows estimated future returns based on an aggregation of several factor models over some important investment horizons :

Butler|Philbrick|Gordillo note that :
You can see from the table that , according to a model that incorporates valuation estimates from 4 distinct domains , and which explains over 80 % of historical returns since 1871 , stocks are likely to deliver 1 % or less in real total returns over the next 5 to 20 years . Yikes .

For me , a sense of indulgence the key to healthy eating . Whenever I feel the least bit deprived or restricted , my mind goes into a state of constant want , and pretty soon it 's bring on all the chocolate and cheese please ( with no sense of moderation ) !
But… what if we could eat healthy and love it ? Well that 's a question I 've been working on answering for years , with some good results too if you do n't mind me saying . You see , my mind usually works something like this ‘ I do n't really want to eat broccoli unless it 's smothered in cheese sauce and browned butter toasted breadcrumbs ' . Next it goes something like this , ‘ why even bother with the broccoli , let 's just put the cheese sauce and toasted breadcrumbs over pasta ? ' – you get the idea , if my brain was in charge it would be all fat and carbohydrates .
However , I 've discovered there 's an entire universe of amazing ( and healthy ) foods out there that I actually love , which means absolutely no sense of deprivation . I figure it 's always a win if you can eat chocolate for breakfast and feel good about it !
This recipe comes together in just minutes if you already have your granola made . Simply blend together the acai packet with bananas , and cocoa powder to make a thick chocolatey base . Then pour the base into bowls before topping it with Greek or coconut yogurt , granola , and pomegranate arils .
I really like to use my Chocolate Almond Granola in this recipe because it enhances the overall chocolate experience .
I 'd even go so far as to say this would work for dessert sometimes with the rich chocolate-acai base , topped with creamy yogurt , Chocolate Almond Granola , and sweet crunchy pomegranates !
The New York Botanical Garden View Full Caption The New York Botanical Garden
THE BRONX — The New York Botanical Garden discriminated against minority students and made a `` lowball '' offer to avoid hiring an observant Jew , according a civil rights lawsuit filed in Manhattan Federal Court on Wednesday .
Andrea Chusid , a former director of membership and visitor experience administration , claimed in the suit that they repeatedly told their bosses about discriminatory behavior they witnessed in 2015 and 2016 but instead of doing something about it , they punished and eventually fired them for speaking up .
In 2015 , they said they witnessed a group of white students given access to a special exhibit of paintings . That same day , mostly minority students from a charter school in The Bronx who watched as white students were allowed inside , were initially denied entrance to the building .
The charter school students were eventually permitted to the view the exhibit for a few minutes at the end of their visit , according to the lawsuit , but the incident sparked Chusid to make a complaint .
When they reported it to human resources , citing the lack of support from their supervisor , Marci Silverman , Silverman began treating them differently , they claim . They replaced praise and support with negative feedback , the lawsuit says .
In their claim , they also say that groups of public school students who are supposed to have free access to the grounds and exhibitions were routinely forced to purchase All Garden passes and were still denied entry to special exhibitions .
Additionally , Chusid said they saw further discrimination when they were then involved in the hiring of a membership coordinator . The preferred candidate also had another job offer and NYBG was planning on raising the salary offer from $ 40,000 to $ 45,000 .
But when Silverman found out the candidate was an observant Jew , they expressed concerns about their schedule , and suggested offering them a `` lowball '' offer of $ 35,000 so that they would feel compelled to reject it .
`` Silverman 's suggestion was blatant , unlawful discrimination towards an observant Jewish candidate , '' the lawsuit says .
After Chusid formally complained , the investigation into the incident was quickly closed after only Silverman 's account was heard , according to the suit .
The boss began to nitpick about their work and gave less positive annual reviews , Chusid claims , and `` harsh retaliatory treatment '' caused Chusid emotional stress and anxiety that required medication , the lawsuit says .
Chusid applied for family and medical leave and received a final written warning from Silverman the following day . A week after Chusid 's leave was approved , they were fired , according to the suit .
She 's asking for lost wages , lost future earnings , lawyers fees , court fees and other damages .
The New York Botanical Garden , where Silverman still works as a vice president for membership and visitor experience , did not respond to a request for comment .
Food bank use in Canada is on the rise , and some provinces and territories have seen `` drastic '' surges in use since last year , a new report says .
In March 2016 , 863,492 people received food from a food bank in Canada , up 1.3 per cent from the same time last year , and 28 per cent from March 2008 , according to the Hunger Count 2016 report from Food Banks Canada .
A forklift backs up with crates of food for Feed Nova Scotia , the organization that distributes to 147 food banks across the province . ( CBC ) Every province had an increase except Ontario and Manitoba , and some saw double-digit spikes .
The territories had the biggest spike , with a 24.9 per cent rise in food bank use . The increases for the provinces were as follows :
Nova Scotia , 20.9 per cent .
Alberta , 17.6 per cent .
Saskatchewan , 17.5 per cent .
P.E.I. , 6.9 per cent .
Quebec , 5.3 per cent .
Newfoundland and Labrador , 5.3 per cent
New Brunswick , 4.1 per cent .
`` If I look at what the team is telling us , we can not feed ourselves out of this crisis — we ca n't do it , '' said Nick Jennery of Feed Nova Scotia , the organization that distributes food to the province 's 147 food banks .
As the number of hungry Canadians rises , refugees are adding to the count , Jennery said .
`` They are a big challenge for at least three food banks that we support , '' they said . `` Those food banks have seen almost double the number of clients . ''
Spike in rural use
Still , they caution that 's just one small piece of the puzzle regarding hunger across the country .
Rural areas , where there are far fewer refugees , have seen a 2.3 per cent increase in food bank use from last year — much of it from Indigenous and elderly people .
Canadians living on pensions accounted for eight per cent of food bank use nationally , but that number rises to 10 per cent in rural areas .
First Nations , Métis , and Inuit people accounted for 14 per cent of people receiving food nationally in March 2016 , but made up 29 per cent in rural areas and more than 70 per cent in Northern Canada .
Food prices are a major factor in the North . In Nunavut , food costs are up to three times the national average .
Previous Next
Hungry children
Children account for 35 per cent of users across the country .
Single people make up half the food bank use , and lone-parent households account for 22 per cent , even though they only make up 10 per cent of Canadian households .
`` It is well-documented that people prefer not to access food banks — they exhaust other avenues of support before taking that step , '' the report reads , noting that people often go into debt , sell their belongings , skip their bills or even go hungry rather than ask for help .
`` These coping mechanisms can be more difficult for families with children — some sacrifices just are n't possible when kids are involved . ''
'How did you get to this point ? '
Much food bank clients feel stigma about accepting the help — so much so that a man who volunteers at Eastview Neighbourhood Community Centre in Toronto but also uses the food bank there asked CBC News not to use their name . They fear being identified could jeopardize their hopes of returning to work in the non-profit sector .

The man , who worked in community development and social justice before becoming ill more than 10 years ago , is currently on Ontario disability support and remembers the first time they went to a food bank .
`` It was very , very emotional , '' they told CBC News . `` It was very humiliating , in many ways for my sense of who I was . ''
`` You sort of question who you are , how did you get to this point ? ''
Calls for basic income
Food Bank Canada recommends creating a national basic income to curb the `` unacceptably high '' reliance on food banks .
Also known as a guaranteed minimum income , basic income is a social policy that would supplant various welfare programs by providing a baseline amount of money to all citizens , regardless of whether they work or meet a means test .
The report calls it `` an alternative to Canada 's existing last-resort income system ( variously known as welfare , social assistance , income assistance , etc . ) , in which people facing hard times are forced to open every corner of their lives to an invasive government bureaucracy just to access a grossly inadequate monthly income . ''
Ontario has recently announced a basic income pilot program , while Quebec has expressed interest in studying the feasibility of one .
Jennery wants governments , non-governmental organizations and businesses to have an engaged conversation about economic issues and the price of food .
`` It means looking at those numbers , frankly , with expertise that we do n't have and understanding how we get people to a better place , '' they said .
It 's important for people to realize that being forced to turn to food banks for help can happen to anyone , said the volunteer and client at the community centre in Toronto .
`` It 's not exclusive to someone in a particular situation , or someone that lives in a particular postal code , or someone who has a particular level of education , '' they said . `` This is impacting many , many people across the spectrum . ''

Path to the Draft is a series tracking MTSU football players as they prepare for the NFL Draft . The Daily News Journal will track Blue Raider standouts as they inch closer to their dream of becoming professional football players .
MURFREESBORO — Although any given team could call Kevin Byard 's name during the NFL Draft , the MTSU safety said they would n't mind playing close to where they made a name for himself .
One of the latest mock drafts from Matt Miller , an NFL Draft and lead writer for Bleacher Report , has Byard going in the fifth round to the Tennessee Titans .
The Titans released veteran safety Michael Griffin on Tuesday .
“ I think it 'd be a great experience and great for me , ” Byard said about the possibility of playing for the Titans . “ Just being there in Middle Tennessee and knowing that 's where a lot of my fans are , that 'd be great . ”
Although they said he 'd like to play for the Titans , Byard said just hearing their name called from any team would be a dream come true .
Fresh off a Senior Bowl appearance , Byard said they were pleased with their performance after recording an interception during the week leading up to the showcase and two tackles during the game .
“ I think I did pretty well , no busted coverage or anything like that , ” Byard said . “ I feel like I had a solid game and killed it during the week . ”
Byard said the week leading up to the game was intense having met with representatives from at least two dozen NFL teams .
They added that more than half of the teams watched film of their career at MTSU but that questions also went as far back as high school .
“ They were asking everything from what my high school career was like to describing a typical day for Kevin Byard , ” they said . “ But there were also a couple of secondary coaches who went over coverage schemes . ”
Byard did n't receive an invite to the NFL Combine though that has n't stopped them from preparing for NFL scouts . Following the Senior Bowl , Byard returned to Michael Johnson Performance in McKinney , Texas to continue working on cutting down their 40-yard dash time .
Byard said he 'll continue to work out in Texas ahead of MTSU 's pro day in late March .
“ I think that 's what teams want to see , ” Byard said about one of the most scrutinized drills ahead of the NFL Draft . “ I 'm just trying to get in the best shape as possible so I can go out there and kill it . ”
The NFL Draft takes place April 28 in Chicago , Ill .

Journalists : U.S. media censorship is ‘ rampant '
By IPS/GIN | Last updated : Jul 17 , 2003 - 9:03:00 PM
What 's your opinion on this article ?
Iraq & the Media ( FAIR , Fairness & Accuracy in Reporting )
OSLO , Norway ( IPS/GIN ) —If the reality in Iraq is one thing and the reporting of it another , that is because much of the media wants it that way , say two leading journalists who have been reporting the `` other '' side of the Iraq story .
The level of self-censorship in the media has risen , not just since the Iraq war , but also since 9/11 , agreed Robert Fisk of The Independent newspaper in Britain and John Pilger , an Australian broadcaster and film-maker .
Both men spoke to IPS on visits to Oslo . Mr. Pilger came to receive the $ 100,000 Sophie Prize for 30 years of work to expose deception in the media . Mr. Fisk came to give a lecture at Fritt Ord , a Norwegian media foundation .
`` Propaganda is not found just in totalitarian states , '' Mr. Pilger says . `` There , at least they know they are being lied to . We tend to assume it is the truth . In the U.S. , censorship is rampant . ''
Self-censorship , that is . This kind of self-censorship is an increasing problem , and leads to one-dimensional coverage that journalists must learn to transcend , Mr. Pilger says .
`` The most important soldiers in the Iraq war were not the troops , but the journalists and the broadcasters , '' they say . `` Lies were transformed into themes for public debate . The true reason was of course—as we all now know—not to rid Iraq of Saddam Hussein and remove their alleged weapons of mass destruction , but to achieve the real Anglo-American aim : to capture an oil-rich country and to control the Middle East . ''
Self-censorship is a particular problem because of the `` myth of neutrality '' that surrounds Western media . `` When you declare yourself neutral , everybody else seems biased , '' Mr. Pilger says . `` But , as seen in the Iraq coverage and elsewhere , journalists very often assume the culture of the media institution and all its unwritten restrictions . ''
But even the term `` self-censorship '' is not quite right , Mr. Pilger says , `` because many journalists are unaware that they are censoring themselves . ''
Media organizations are now under tight control , Mr. Pilger says . Just five corporations rule the broadcasters in the United States . In Australia , right-wing tycoon Rupert Murdoch controls 70 percent of the media .
`` We live in an age of information , '' they say . `` Yet , the media is not attacking the ruling system . The media has never before been so controlled , and propaganda is all around . Most of us do n't even see it . ''
The three main dangers facing the world , Mr. Pilger says , are silence , betrayal and power—and journalists can make silence dangerous .
Mr. Fisk says the story in Iraq most correspondents chose not to report was the `` bomb now , die later '' policy through use of depleted uranium ( DU ) . Since the Gulf War of 1991 , the number of cancer patients in Iraq has risen , and `` strange vegetables '' have begun to appear on the market . The distortions were most likely caused by use of DU , they say .
`` I told my colleagues that this was an interesting story that should be reported , '' Mr. Fisk says . `` But most of them said , honestly Bob , we do not want to write home about sick children . An official American military document states that DU dust can indeed be spread in battles and lead to serious illness in humans , but this is not reported . ''
The public and civil society opposed the Iraq war because they understood the hidden agenda , but `` editors have a tendency to underestimate their readership , '' they say . Readers are seen as ignorant or disinterested .
Self-censorship continues in Iraq after the war , and elsewhere , Mr. Fisk says . `` Many more people have died so far in the war against terrorism than on Sept. 11 , 2001 , '' they say . `` That is the story of our time , and very few are writing it . ''
Twenty thousand people have died in the still-sputtering Afghanistan war , seven times more than on Sept. 11 , Mr. Fisk says . This is just one example of the `` great power of silence that is threatening to dominate us all . ''
Coupled with the self-censorship is the censorship being imposed by the U.S. on the Iraqi media , Mr. Fisk says . This , too , is not being reported adequately in the United States .
The U.S. administration has set up a committee for censorship in Iraq , which means the Iraqi press can publish anything to remind people about the terror of Saddam , but is not allowed to write freely about current events crucial to them and their future .
But Mr. Pilger sees reason for optimism . `` There is a movement of resistance globally from the landless peoples movement in Brazil to the huge anti-war movement , '' they say . `` Nothing like this has ever happened before in my lifetime . ''
The superpower in Washington is being challenged by the other superpower , they say , the superpower of public opinion .
The mainstream media has been flogged like a peasant 's nag in a Dostoevsky novel by critics on both sides of the political divide . For those of us who drink the nectar of abject cynicism , the situation is as sweet as it could be . The left complains of media bias ; the right complains of media bias ; and both are convinced that the majority of our woes stem directly from that hideous old beast , the MSM , that refuses to pull .
While it is easy to assume that the slimy tentacles of Rupert Murdoch 's ideology or the latte stains of the Grey Lady are to blame , what if that is n't the case ?
The Economist ( Nov. 1st – 7th , 2008 ; “ Economics focus : A biased market ” , p. 88 ) implies that We the People might be the maker of media bias . A 2005 study by S. Mullainathan and A. Shleifer suggests that readers want neither “ fair ” nor “ balanced ” ; they want their beliefs confirmed by the news . Market principles are counterproductive to truth because media seeks profit , and it will print what sells . In an homogeneous market , then , there is good reason to slant coverage . Furthermore , slanting is easy . A rise of 0.2 % in unemployment figures could headline as “ Recession Fears Grow ” or “ Turnaround in Sight ” , depending on how you want to look at it .
In 2007 , M. Gentzkow and J. Shapiro took the idea further . First , they analyzed Congressional debates to identify phrases that were used disproportionately by Democrats or Republicans . They then analyzed more than 400 newspapers to determine how often newspapers used partisan language . With a measure of slant established , the authors next compared newspaper circulation with vote share in the 2004 presidential election and the likelihood of people within the market to contribute to political causes . Not surprisingly , they found that circulation did correspond to prevalent political views in a given zip code . Going one step further , they calculated what amount of slant would maximize newspaper profit in its market and compared that to the actual slant . The two slants showed a striking congruence .
Both studies concentrated on newspapers , but I would suspect that their findings would be amplified when applied to radio , television , and the internet . There may be only one newspaper directly serving a local market , whereas the consumer has nearly unlimited choice beyond print media . If your first instinct when checking the news is to visit The Huffington Post , then you 've already made a choice about what news you want and how you want it . Furthermore , the editors of such a site have even fewer reasons than print editors to include differing views or to attempt unbiased coverage . The rapidity of the news cycle and the nature of the web-market almost certainly create a feedback loop that produces more and more slant with less and less exposure to differing opinions . Print media , which has fallen on the hardest of times , would then be likely to increase slant in an effort to compete with media that gives the consumer exactly what they want…a political reflection .
Mullainathan and Shleifer found that a heterogeneous reader can obtain an unbiased version of the news ; they did not suggest , as I will , that the heterogeneous reader is also likely to be an abject cynic . What else could you be if you have to cross mountains of slant to find something as simple as hard news ? Whether you roll around in the mud by choice or not , you 're still dirty .
So is the dreaded MSM innocent ? Is it all our fault for being so neurotic and insecure that we need our personal views confirmed in such a way that we can call them facts ? Can we still blame our network of choice for ruining everything ? If I accept responsibility , does that mean that I have to do something about it ? Or , can I just keep blaming everything on all the politicians in Washington that I did n't vote for ?
Obviously , variations on the “ chicken or the egg ” motif are possible here , and neither study goes so far as to state that ownership ideology has no influence . These studies do , however , make interesting additions to the debate . And if nothing else , when someone starts bitching about media bias you can respond , “ Whatever , it 's all your fault anyhow. ” Still , I have to wonder : if you beat the nag to death , what will pull the cart ?
One day , when Marc Andreessen , the money man behind such tech giants as Facebook , Twitter , and Zynga , was out driving around their home in Palo Alto , California , they nearly hit a crazy old man crossing the street .
Looking back at the fool they had nearly run over they noticed the trademark blue jeans and black turtle neck . “ Oh my god ! I almost hit Steve Jobs ! ” they thought to himself .
It was Jobs that day , out on one of their many walks around the Palo Alto area , where Apple are based . Steve Jobs was famous in the area for their long walks , which they used for exercise , contemplation , problem-solving , and even meetings .
And Jobs was not alone . Through history the best minds have found that walking , whether a quick five minute jaunt , or a long four hour trek , has helped them compose , write , paint , and create .
Here are five reasons that walking is one of the best ways you can spend your time , and how it can help you think better , get more done , relate better , and live longer .
01 . It will help make you more creative
Though most people have always thought that their best ideas came when they were on the move , now there is scientific evidence to back them up .
A 2014 study from Stanford University in the US has shown that people are much more creative when they are walking around as opposed to when they are sitting still .
Marily Oppezzo and Daniel Schwartz , who both authored the paper , studied 176 college students as they completed certain creative thinking tasks .
In this study , the authors used an experiment known as Guilford 's Alternative Uses Task . As part of this , they participants were asked to list as many alternative uses for a common object as they can . For instance , a knife could be used to spread butter , to cut bread , to stab someone , or to flick peas . The answers were then scored on originality , number of ideas and detail .
In their study , Oppezzo and Schwartz got the students to perform this task in a few different variations . Either sitting indoors or sitting outdoors , or walking on a treadmill indoors , or walking outside .
They found that when people were walking , either on the treadmill or outdoors , they were 60 % more creative than when sitting around .
To add to this , 81 % of the participants saw an increase in creativity when they were walking .
What 's more , when the participants took a second test after walking , they were still more creative , showing the positive effects of walking continued even after they sat down again .
Though there is no further research into how exactly walking makes you more creative , it is likely that it helps to increase blood flow all around your body , including to the brain to stimulate creativity .
Another interesting finding from the study was that there was no difference between walking on a boring treadmill indoors , and being outside among the birds and the bees . This shows that it is not the environment or sensation that is making walkers more creative , but just the act of walking alone .
It was n't all good news for walking in the study though . The researchers also found that if you had to do focused thinking while walking , answering questions that required a single correct answer , the results were no better than when sitting .
This study should give you some evidence if you want to build walking into your daily and business life . A simple walk outside can aid your creative brain if you find yourself stuck at a desk and unable to elicit the next bright spark . Instead of sitting , waiting for inspiration to strike , head outside for five minutes and see if the extra blood flow can get the creative juices flowing .
02 . It will help you stay healthy
In a TED talk two years ago , Nilofer Merchant , a business innovator that pounds the same Silicon Valley streets as Andreessen does and Jobs did , advocated the virtues of meetings on the move . They had trouble fitting exercise into an already hectic day so started taking their meetings standing up .
In their TED talk they produced a startling statistic – we are on our butts for almost 10 hours of the day on average .
For many it will be many more as they sit at their desks for the working day and then head home to slump in front of the TV or computer . This is not good for us . Not only are our flabby behinds not built for sitting , but neither are our hearts .
Physical inactivity can lead to heart disease , diabetes , and a large number of cancers . It just does n't do us any good to sit around all day . Merchant describes sitting as the new smoking – something which we all do now that is slowly killing us , and that in 10 , 20 , 50 years time people will look back on as crazy .
In fact , walking is as close to a magic pill that we have . Just 30 minutes of walking each day is enough to dramatically reduce your risk of heart disease , colon cancer , breast cancer and dementia .
Though a good 30 minute walk each day would be best , if you do not have time then you can consider breaking it down into more manageable chunks . 10 minutes in the morning , at noon , and in the evening each will add up and help get your body used to a bit of exercise and like help your heart and brain out as well .
03 . It will help you be more productive
If you 've ever watched the TV show The West Wing you will have heard of the phrase “ walk and talk ” . In every single episode , the busy staffers of the presidential office were “ just too busy , goddammit ” to sit around and have meetings , so they would always be discussing , conniving , and gossiping on the move . Though this has become a cliché , something the cast now send up , it 's actually a brilliant idea .
Meetings on the move or walking meetings are very “ in vogue ” at the moment , particularly in Silicon Valley . The idea being that there is no reason really to hold a meeting over a big piece of wood , so why not take it outside and get some exercise at the same time . Nilofer Merchant says that walking meetings now account for 70 % of their exercise during the week , and that they are far more productive than other types of meetings .
For one , there is little distraction . People leave their blackberry 's and smartphones in their pockets when out of a walking meeting , and obviously do not have one eye on their computer screen as can happen when you meet with someone in their office . Plus , you know that you are not going to be disturbed if you are out and about . Of course , this leads to problems for some people .
iPhone Separation Anxiety is real , and people do not like the idea about being away from their desks and electronic contact for any length of time .
Also , people do not know how to act or conduct themselves in such meetings . How do you take notes on the move , for instance ? ( hint : the same way you do when sitting down – with a pen and paper ) . Merchant says that , though people can feel awkward about such meetings , they soon see the benefits and are happy to go for walk and talks if you give them a heads-up . They then can dress appropriately in sneakers instead of high heels .
Of course , the previously mentioned health and creativity benefits also make walking meetings far better than their sit-down cousins .
If you want to start having your meetings on the move , the best idea is to start with a colleague that also wants to get out and about . Arrange a walking meeting each week where you can discuss work issues together and brainstorm ideas . Then you can reach out to others to gauge interest . As Merchant says , give people warning that you are going mobile and you will probably not have any complaints , and probably a lot more ideas .
04 . It 's a great way to communicate
Steve Jobs and Mark Zuckerberg both like first meetings with people to be on the move . This is because a walking conversation is so much more natural and distraction-free than most other types of meetings .
Part of this is because these type of meetings are not so great in that there are more than two people . Though you can get a group of people together for a mass walk and talk , it makes more sense for these meetings to be a one-on-one . The job interview for my first job in science was a walking meeting , as me and my soon-to-be boss walked through the streets of Lausanne , Switzerland discussing where we wanted neuroscience to be in 20 years time .
The naturalness of two people walking along in deep discussion and thought is definitely why these walking meetings are catching on .
You might find that if you are having difficulty communicating an idea to a colleague , then you both heading outside and taking the idea for a few laps around the local park helps immensely .
Again , it is likely that the increased blood flow helps you to come up with not only more creative ideas and solutions to problems , but also helps you express those ideas more fluently and helps you communicate with co-workers .
05 . You will be following in the footsteps of giants
Steve Jobs ' penchant for walks was revealed in the recent Walter Isaacson biography of the man and the reason for walking 's recent renaissance within the tech elite , but they were hardly the first creative genius to discover that ideas flourish on the move .
Beethoven was an avid walker , taking short breaks to stretch their legs while working , and then spending their afternoons wandering around Vienna . They always took a pencil and paper with them to write down anything that struck him . You can see , or rather hear , the influence of these woodland walks in their symphonies , particularly their 6th Symphony , known as their Pastoral Symphony for its country and woodland elements .
Beethoven 's love of walking rubbed off on another genius of the time , Goethe . The composer and the poet meet in the resort town of Teplice on the Czech-German border and went for a walk and talk through the town . Perhaps , though , this is not the best example of a great walking meeting as , though Beethoven originally idolized Goethe , this was very much a case of never meet your idols . The two disliked each other and never met again . Though I hope Goethe continued their walks .
Another of history 's walking enthusiasts was Charles Dickens . Whether in London or at their country house in Kent they always took long walks . And when I say long , I mean long . Dickens could rack up 30 miles a day , or rather night , walking . They would walk whenever the mood took them and whenever they had something to think about , continuing around the streets of London or the country lanes of Kent until the issue was resolved in their head .
This may be a case of the cure is worse than the disease – walking 30 miles each day is unlikely to be very good for you or your joints . If 30 minutes is the minimum you are supposed to walk , then 30 miles is probably nearing the maximum . But it worked for Dickens , as they created some of their most remarkable and memorable characters when out walking , either through thought or through observing the city and people around him .
Another Victorian heavyweight that enjoyed a ramble around Kent was another Charles , Charles Darwin . Darwin had a gravel path installed at their home , not unlike a race track , that they would walk around each day as they thought about problems . The number of laps they did depend on the difficultly of the problem at hand . They would stack stones at the start of their walk and the knock them down one by one as they went round , describing the difficulty of the problem as a three , four , or five-flint problem .
Jobs ' walks around Silicon Valley have led to this being a particularly common trait among young tech leaders .
Mark Zuckerberg , the founder of Facebook , in particular is very fond of a walking meeting . If you are lucky enough to be being considered for a high up position at Facebook , do n't expect to be interviewed by Zuckerberg in their office . No , the man will take you on a tour of the campus , pointing out the different divisions and sounding you out about your experience and thoughts on the company . Their piecè de résistance is to finish the walk and talk meeting on a promontory overlooking Silicon Valley and the other tech giants , telling you that they are bigger , better , and richer than all below , in true super-villain style . Presumably you get pushed off if you decline their offer .
Jack Dorsey , co-founder of Twitter and now heading up digital finance company Square , takes all new hires at Square for their ‘ Gandhi walk ' on their first Friday . This is an epic walk through the streets of San Francisco to the Square offices while they espouse on the guiding principles behind Square .
If you are choosing to spend your afternoons rambling in the woods , or chose to take people out for a Wonder rather than meet in a stuffy office , you know you are in good company .
Take a walk today !
The conclusion is… walking is great . Not only will it make you more creative , it will help you get those ideas over to your colleagues better and allow you to fit more into your day . All while helping you not to die early . Fantastic .
So , why do n't we do it ? Well , sometimes it 's cold outside , or raining , or we are feeling sluggish , or any other of a thousand reasons we have to not get up and out each day .
But if you start with just finding a few extra minutes each day for a walk , or try to move some part of your day , such as meetings outside , then you 'll find that walking is as natural as… walking . You 'll think more , do more , learn more , and live longer . Get walking !
BOGOTA , Colombia — “ Drugs win drug war . ”
That was the prescient headline of a 1998 dispatch in The Onion . “ Despite all our efforts , ” the satirical newspaper reported , “ the U.S. government has proven no match for the awesome power of the illegal high . ”
Funny stuff . But a dozen years later , serious news outlets are writing pretty much the same story .
“ After 40 years , ” the Associated Press reported this month , “ the United States ' war on drugs has cost $ 1 trillion and hundreds of thousands of lives , and for what ? Drug use is rampant and violence even more brutal and widespread . ”
As a correspondent in South America , I cover the upstream end of the illegal drug business , the waste and failure of which has seemed to make no difference to policymakers in Washington .
It 's not that drug-war skeptics have some magic formula . But for a long time , U.S. lawmakers shied away from even considering alternatives to our zero-tolerance militaristic approach for fear of being labeled soft on drugs and losing the next election .
That 's why it 's been fascinating to watch drug-law reforms bubble up from cash-strapped state governments in the U.S. And though changes to our approach overseas have been slower to materialize , the Obama administration — which announced its new drug control strategy this month — is making a few moves in the right direction in places like Colombia and Afghanistan .
“ For once we have the wind at our backs instead of in our faces , ” said Bill Piper of the New York-based Drug Policy Alliance , the leading organization in the United States promoting alternatives to the war on drugs . “ More people are talking about alternatives and saying in public what they thought in private . ”
Many of the domestic initiatives are practical moves to deal with budget deficits and prisons overcrowded with non-violent drug offenders .
Californians , for example , will vote in November on a referendum on whether to legalize marijuana for casual users , a policy that some studies suggest could bring in more than $ 1.4 billion in annual tax revenue .
New Jersey recently became the 14th state to approve the use of marijuana for medical purposes , a move that the District of Columbia may follow . If so , we could have medical marijuana dispensaries in the nation 's capital sometime next year .
States are getting rid of mandatory minimum sentences for drug offenders . And several top-notch universities , including Harvard , are experimenting with hallucinogens as possible treatments for cancer , post-traumatic stress and depression .
But will these sensible changes at home translate into more effective U.S. policies abroad ?
Skeptics point out that two-thirds of Obama 's $ 15 billion annual drug-control budget is dedicated to interdiction and law enforcement even though many studies show that programs to prevent and treat drug abuse are far more cost effective .
Washington has also poured huge sums into forcibly eradicating plots of coca and opium , the raw materials for cocaine and heroin . But peasant farmers often press deeper into the wilderness to grow more drugs . And around the world , heroin and cocaine remain relatively cheap , potent and widely available .
Last year , Richard Holbrooke , Obama 's special envoy to Afghanistan , finally acknowledged the obvious . They put a stop to U.S.-supported programs to eradicate opium poppies in that country , saying the effort was turning local communities that depend on drug profits against the U.S.-backed Afghan government .
“ Eradication is a waste of money , ” Holbrooke said . “ It might destroy some acreage , but it did n't reduce the amount of money the Taliban got by one dollar . It just helped the Taliban . So we 're going to phase out eradication . ''
Instead , there will be a greater U.S. focus on fighting high-level traffickers and promoting legal economic activities in Afghanistan , the source of 93 percent of the world 's heroin .
In Colombia , Washington is sharply drawing down the budget for forced eradication of coca and opium , though the idea is for the Colombian government to take over some of those chores . Yet both governments have endorsed a more “ holistic ” approach .
In former guerrilla and drug-trafficking strongholds where the Colombian government is trying to win over the civilian population , eradication is being closely coordinated with efforts to set up police stations , build roads and schools and provide alternative sources of employment for farmers trying to leave the drug business .
Then , there 's Mexico where the ferocious violence seems like a flashback to Colombia in the 1980s and 1990s .
Washington is providing the Mexican government with $ 1.4 billion in equipment and police training to target drug gangs . But since President Felipe Calderon took office in December 2006 , Mexico has registered nearly 23,000 drug-related killings .
Both governments seem at a loss over what to do next which means that , for now , they 'll likely stay the course .
Yet there have been some rhetorical shifts from U.S. officials . Secretary of State Clinton and others have acknowledged American responsibility for domestic drug consumption and for the flow of assault weapons and drug profits to bad guys south of the border . There 's also a growing recognition that Mexico will likely get nowhere unless the government cleans up its corrupt law enforcement agencies .
“ There 's a realization that the drug war has n't accomplished what had been hoped for , ” said John Walsh of the Washington Office on Latin America think tank . “ We are seeing some new attitudes but this has n't always translated into new policies . ”
After years of floundering , however , even small policy changes should be cheered .
And as for what to do in Mexico , policymakers can always turn to The Onion for inspiration . One of its latest dispatches from the drug war was headlined : “ DEA hires Lil Wayne to use up all drugs in Mexico . ”
John Otis covers Colombia for GlobalPost . They are the author of a new book `` Law of the Jungle : The Hunt for Colombian Guerrillas , American Hostages , and Buried Treasure . ''

In 1966 , the British Sub-Aqua Club ( BSAC ) set up an investigation committee for diving equipment , including dive watches , which back then were deemed not only “ a vital part ” of the diver 's equipment , but apparently also the most troublesome . In 1968 , BSAC member Geoff Harwood concluded that “ the majority of the complaints and allegations of faulty equipment and unsatisfactory dealings with manufacturers and distributors have been concerned with diving watches ” — which led to the decision “ to carry out a survey in order to determine the extent of the problem . ”
Thanks to former professional diver , dive historian , author , and the U.K. 's historical diving society editor Peter Dick , whom I had the fortune of meeting at the last annual meeting of the German Historical Diving Society ( see report here ) , we at DiveIntoWatches.com can now , nearly 50 years after its first publication , reveal the results of this amazing survey — so far the only such review I have ever come across and also a most unique opportunity to get a glimpse of one of the most important eras in underwater timekeeping .
Of course , we have to emphasize , as does the original report , “ that since so few of each make are represented we can not draw a conclusion as to ‘ best buy ' or to definitely not recommend a certain watch. ” However , upon looking at how those 93 watches from 17 manufacturers performed during an astonishing 7,260 dives , it is safe to say that you can definitely find much more reliable diving equipment for your wrist these days . At the time the survey was released , one of its conclusions was thus : “ [ E ] ven if you buy an internationally famous watch costing over £50 you still stand a fair chance of finding it full of water when you come to start your decompression schedule after a deep dive . ”
Without further ado : the results of the BSAC 's 1968 survey , as published in the BSAC diving officer 's conference paper :
“ Completely satisfied ” meant that owners made no adverse comments ; “ Completely dissatisfied ” meant that watches failed from the start or were n't satisfactorily repaired .
TAIPEI ( Reuters ) - Three HTC Corp design executives were arrested on suspicion of leaking trade secrets , sending the Taiwanese smartphone maker 's shares tumbling on Monday as its troubles deepened amid a wave of senior staff departures and disappointing sales .

Taipei prosecutors confirmed that HTC vice president of product design Thomas Chien , research and development director Wu Chien-Hung and senior manager of design and innovation Justin Huang were arrested on Friday .
Chien and Chien-Hung remain in custody , while Huang was released on bail , prosecutors office spokesperson Mou Hsin Huang said .
The executives were also accused of making false commission fee claims totaling around T $ 10 million ( $ 334,200 ) . No further details about the allegations were immediately available .
The arrests came in response to a complaint filed by HTC last month accusing the executives of leaking trade secrets .
HTC declined to comment except to say the investigation had no impact on its operations . Chien and Chien-Hung could not be reached and Huang was not immediately available to comment .
Media reports citing the police said the executives were planning to use stolen new interface technology to set up a new mobile design company aiming at Chinese vendors .
Shares of HTC lost 6.4 percent to T $ 146.5 at 0250 GMT , versus a 0.2 percent fall in the broader market .
Rocked by internal feuding and executive exits , and positioned at the high end of a smartphone market that is close to saturation , HTC has seen its market share slump to below 5 percent from around a quarter five years ago .
Its stock price is at 8-year lows , and it has warned it could make its first operating loss this quarter .

Fourth Industrial Revolution : Will Australia be the 'lucky country ' in tomorrow 's economy ?
Updated
Australians have much to be proud of when it comes to their economy .
In June , the country broke the developed world 's record for the longest run of uninterrupted growth .
Yet Australia is not where it used to be , nor where it could be .
The `` Fourth Industrial Revolution '' is here , and set to shake up Australia : how we respond will shape our chances in tomorrow 's economy .
Where are we now ?
According to IMF analysis , Australia 's average growth is almost a full percentage point lower per year than before the global financial crisis ; growth in non-mining sectors is weak despite declines in real interest rates ; and wage growth has been disappointing .
The IMF calls this combination `` symptoms of the new mediocre '' .
In this light , Australia 's consistent run of growth could be seen as fortuitous complacency rather than genuine dynamism .
Perhaps it 's worth remembering that the phrase `` the lucky country '' was coined by Donald Horne in 1964 as a kick in the pants to a parochial , regionally-disconnected country relying too heavily on natural resources to support its quality of life .
Even after decades of global technological growth , according to the Atlas of Economic Complexity , roughly 80 per cent of Australia 's physical exports by value in 2016 were minerals , metals , stone , foodstuff and wood .
It might be time to again ask , as Horne did , `` have the conditions that led to so much success also weakened our adaptability and slowed down our survival reflex ? ''
What 's coming ?
The question is apt , because we are currently watching a range of extraordinary new technologies emerge .
Technologies like artificial intelligence , distributed ledgers , additive manufacturing ( and many more ) herald a range of radical transformations which wo n't just affect how we do business .
They are also challenging our identities and institutions , radically altering how we relate to one another and even raising the question of what it means to be human .
Digital , biological and physical technologies are converging , bringing social , economic and political change . At the World Economic Forum , we call this the Fourth Industrial Revolution .
It represents a huge opportunity for Australia , one that can make use of the country 's best asset — a highly-educated population .
The Fourth Industrial Revolution is not about simply promoting innovation writ large , nor espousing the benefits of digital technology , though both are important .
Around the world , entrepreneurs and organisations are building entirely new systems to create , exchange and distribute value .
There 's opportunity to build on digital capabilities and to innovate in ways that help Australians not only adapt to a new world , but shape it .
Why change ?
But to what end would we latch on to this opportunity ? Faster growth is certainly one outcome . Research by NESTA for the UK found correlation between innovation and growth rates in companies . And , while data is scarce , McKinsey reports that adopting recent artificial intelligence approaches such as deep learning leads to higher growth rates , at least for companies fully committed to them .
The prize is large . A recent report from AlphaBeta estimated Australia could earn more than $ 2 trillion by 2030 if it doubles investments in automation technologies , such as artificial intelligence and robotics .
While such a transition will require supporting millions of workers whose jobs will change , failure to adapt to global trends in automation will result in a less competitive industry and shift stress onto other areas of the economy .
But growth rates are a means , not an end . The GDP numbers reported quarterly by the Reserve Bank are , after all , just a way of keeping score .
For Australians to feel that new technologies , new business models and new labour market structures are truly beneficial , they should improve people 's lives in meaningful ways .
So what should Australians do to keep the luck running ?
Collaboration is key
First , we need to collaborate better and more often—both across firms and across sectors .
Australia 's Industry Monitor 2016 reports that the level of collaboration among Australian companies is well below the OECD average : the number collaborating with universities and other non-commercial research organisations is among the lowest in the OECD .
Meanwhile , trust levels across sectors are low : only 40 per cent of the general public trust Australian institutions according to the Edelman 2017 Barometer , and only 26 per cent of Australians find CEOs to be credible—a drop of 13 percentage points since 2016 .
Conversely , Australia 's growing biotech sector is a case study that has all the elements for success — highly skilled labour , collaboration with research institutions , robust entrepreneurship , government support , and industry partnerships .
Working together across stakeholder groups can be a huge boon for innovation , which often requires seeking out alternative sets of knowledge .
Innovation emerges from new perspectives to familiar objects and problems .
AusBiotech 's Industry Position Survey 2017 highlights that this last year was the strongest on record with more than 77 per cent of companies expecting to grow . From investors to policymakers , collaboration in the biotech sector shows that Australia has the right ingredients to make the most of the opportunities of the Fourth Industrial Revolution .
Lose the fear
Second , we need to accelerate both the development and adoption of new technologies across Australian firms , non-profit organisations and the public sector .
One challenge is cutting through both the hype and fear around emerging technologies , and demystifying topics like `` artificial intelligence '' to encourage more Australians to have a go and put them to use to solve local challenges .
Having a go means investing in people : not just future generations , but today 's workforce , and ourselves .
Australian entrepreneur Jeremy Howard has shown with their non-profit training programme fast.ai , deep learning approaches are accessible to anyone with a little coding experience and access to low-cost cloud computing services .
Atlassian 's Mike Cannon-Brookes has called out the need for more resources in technology training , specifically software engineering , and highlighted the challenge of needing to import almost half of the senior positions in a technology-driven company because of a lack of local expertise .
Shape our direction
Finally , and perhaps most importantly , we need a deep and engaging public conversation about what we want from the new technology age .
We are lucky to live at the beginning of the Fourth Industrial Revolution — offering the opportunity to shape our future relationship with technology to be a more inclusive , fair and sustainable future .
But this opportunity must be grasped by people , and requires thinking deeply and discussing broadly what matters most for cultivating a flourishing society and charting a new course for prosperity .
We owe it to ourselves to make sure that the Fourth Industrial Revolution not only generates a dynamic economy , but also serves the public interest .
And , as George Megalogenis alluded to in their Quarterly Essay last eyar , we ca n't afford to panic at the prospect of describing our shared future .
Here , we can turn again to what Horne saw as the virtues of the Australian public . In the Fourth Industrial Revolution , perhaps even more so than in the 1960s , we should build on the good qualities of Australians : their tolerance , their sense of fair play , their adaptability , scepticism , courage and talent for improvisation .
It 's good to be lucky . In turbulent times , making our own luck is even better .

BEIJING ( REUTERS ) - The Chinese capital was on the second-highest orange smog alert in the depth of winter on Tuesday ( Jan 3 ) as city officials said the air quality was improving overall , citing data for the whole of last year .
Over the new year holiday , hundreds of flights were cancelled and highways closed across northern China as average concentrations of small breathable particles known as PM2.5 soared above 500 micrograms per cubic metre in Beijing and surrounding regions .
Pollution alerts are common in northern China , especially during bitterly cold winters when energy demand , much of it met by coal , soars .
But the Beijing Municipal Environmental Protection Bureau told state media that PM2.5 concentrations dropped 9.9 per cent on the year to an average of 73 micrograms per cubic metre in the Chinese capital in 2016 .
The total number of `` blue sky days '' reached 198 in 2016 , up 12 from the previous year . However , the average PM2.5 measure still exceeded national air quality standards by 109 per cent , the bureau said .

Despite a brief respite on Monday , smog returned to the Chinese capital on Tuesday , with PM2.5 readings again at `` hazardous '' levels . The city environment bureau said the orange alert was expected to last until Wednesday .
China is in the third year of a `` war on pollution '' aimed at reversing the damage done to its skies , soil and water after decades of untrammelled economic growth .
It has created emergency response systems that restrict traffic and shut down factories and construction sites during periods of heavy smog , and it has also vowed to punish local officials and enterprises that break rules .
During a bout of smog in December , inspectors identified 21 enterprises that had violated regulations by failing to close operations on time , and 10 more inspection teams were dispatched to cities across the region over the new year .
But government officials have expressed frustration that persistently heavy winter pollution , brought about by unfavourable weather and the use of coal-fired urban heating systems , has overshadowed the genuine progress China has made to reduce smog .
The FA Cup third-round draw brought a local derby but no glamorous rewards for the non-league teams left in this season 's competition , with Jaap Stam 's return to Manchester United as Reading manager one of the round 's few intriguing subplots .
There will be four all-Premier League ties when the FA Cup resumes early next year but the heavyweights all avoided the seven non-league sides in the draw .
Sutton United 's reward for beating the League Two strugglers Cheltenham on Saturday is a home tie against their near neighbours AFC Wimbledon . The League One club staged a remarkable recovery to see off Curzon Ashton on Sunday , coming back from three goals down to win 4-3 , and will hope to avoid another scare in a cup derby that at least offers Sutton the opportunity of a place in the fourth round .

Barrow , the other National League team left in the FA Cup , will host League One Rochdale , Halifax Town or Eastleigh will travel to Brentford , Stourbridge will be away at Wycombe Wanderers should they overcome Northampton Town , and Rotherham await the winners of Macclesfield Town versus Oxford United .
While the non-league clubs were left dreaming of what might have been , or perhaps have their hopes of a Premier League opponent on hold until round four , the stakes were raised for the replay between Newport County and Plymouth Argyle next Tuesday with a trip to Liverpool awaiting the winners . Steven Gerrard , who drew Jürgen Klopp 's team at home , joked that they “ should get a job ” for the favourable tie for their former club .
The oustanding tie of the round is arguably Manchester City 's visit to West Ham United , Pep Guardiola 's first taste of the FA Cup , while the holders United have a home game against a Reading side managed by their former title-winning defender Stam . Andy Cole , Stam 's former Old Trafford team-mate , said : “ I look forward to that . He 's done very well at Reading . I 'm sure he 'll get a good reception . I 'm not surprised by how well they have done . I 'm really pleased for him . ”
The Premier League champions , Leicester City , will face Everton at Goodison Park , Hull City will host Swansea City and Sunderland will be at home to Burnley in the other all-top-flight ties . Arsenal is away at Preston North End while their north London rivals Tottenham Hotspur will be at home to Steve Bruce 's Aston Villa . The third round ties will be played on 6-9 January .

SXSW got off to a rollicking good start with the midnight premiere of Fede Alvarez 's new film Do n't Breathe last night . There was a lot of speculation surrounding the film as not much was known about it , and it turns out that 's the best way to view the film ! Do n't Breathe is a masterclass in audience manipulation that proves Fede Alvarez is n't a one-trick pony . It 's almost hard to believe that this is just their second feature film , but here we are and we have been gifted with this absolutely wonderful and fucking awesome film . It is one of the most tense viewing experiences I 've ever had and should definitely be viewed with an audience .
The plot of the film is simple : Detroit teenagers Rocky ( Jane Levy , Evil Dead , ABC 's Suburgatory ) , Alex ( Dylan Minnette , Goosebumps , ABC 's Scandal ) and Money ( Daniel Zovatto , It Follows , ABC 's Revenge ) and break into a blind man 's ( Stephen Lang , Avatar , Gods and Generals ) home thinking they 'll get away with the perfect crime . Little do they know that this blind man is incredibly adept at protecting themselves and everything in their home . Think You 're Next had a baby with Panic Room and you 've got Do n't Breathe .
To say any more about Do n't Breathe would spoil the fun of the completely unpredictable viewing experience . Formerly known as The Man in the Dark , Do n't Breathe is a mostly silent film . In fact , it would be surprising if there were even 30 pages worth of dialogue in the script . Once the blind man wakes up , everything goes silent and we are left to Alvarez 's devices . It becomes immediately clear that they are running the show , and what a show it is .
Alvarez co-wrote the film with their Evil Dead co-scribe Rodo Sayagues , and their script , as minimal as it is , is exceptionally taut . This may seem like an odd compliment to give a film that maybe has about 20 minutes of spoken dialogue ( and I 'm fairly sure it 's even less than that ) , but Alvarez and Sayagues do n't waste a single minute of screen time . The whole thing is an exercise in suspense that would make even Hitchcock proud . Equally impressive are the extra-long tracking shots employed throughout the film . There were multiple times where I would be watching things transpire on screen and think “ Is this still the same shot ? ” It 's absolutely hypnotic .
Jane Levy takes center stage here and boy does that honor come with a price . After what they had to go through as an actor during Evil Dead , it is surprising that they returned for an equally brutal treatment in Do n't Breathe . One scene in particular had the audience squirming in their seats , and it certainly makes one wonder why Levy is n't getting more work . With this , Evil Dead and Suburgatory under their belt , the actor has certainly proven their worth to a project .
Faring equally well is Lang , who emerges as one of the silver screen 's best “ villains ” in years . Even as a blind man , they are an incredibly imposing figure . Do n't Breathe may not qualify as an actual horror movie , but Lang imbues the film with plenty of horror , and their casting pays off in spades . Minnette and Zovato are also great , although they are given significantly less to work with than Levy and Lang .
If there is one complaint to be had about the film it 's that it ends . Once the credits roll it dawns on you that this fantastic viewing experience has come to an end and you must carry on with your everyday life . In all seriousness though , I could have used a little more closure in the final reel , but that is a minor quibble in an otherwise solid film .
I could say a thousand more words about Do n't Breathe , but suffice it to say that I absolutely adored it . It was a fantastic way to open the festival and is exactly the kind of nail-bitingly tense adrenaline rush that audiences crave . The idea of overhyping a film bothers me a lot , and I feel like this review will do just that , but I refuse to mask my love for Do n't Breathe . I ca n't wait to see what Alvarez has in store for us next !

A study published in the journal Dreaming has revealed that your body position during sleep can greatly influence the content of your dreams . Calvin Kai-Ching Yu , a researcher at Shue Yan University in Hong Kong spoke to 670 students , getting them to fill out detailed surveys about their sleep and dream lives .
They found that those who slept on their stomachs reported a higher incidence of feeling sensations related to ‘ sex ' and ‘ persecution ' than those who adopted other sleeping positions .
The researchers think it might have something to do with the brain getting less oxygen , which results in the sensation of feeling constricted . They also speculated that when we sleep face down , our genitals receive more stimulus from the bed and sheets , so our brains incorporate that into dreams with an erotic theme .
Kai-Ching Yu concluded that
“ This study provides the evidence that dream experiences , and in particular dream content , can be influenced by body posture during sleep . I believe that the brain during sleep is not at all totally detached from the external world , and stimuli , including those stemming from the environment , are probably incorporated into dream content more often than people observe or are aware of . The unconscious brains of the dreamers try to make sense , and even make use of , the external stimuli . ”

Rose Harr was raised in a blue-collar home in Michigan . Them father worked third shift for General Motors Corp. in Flint . When they launched their information technology company , BlueWare , in 1993 , they chose the northern Michigan community of Cadillac as its headquarters .
There they entered the burgeoning field of digital medical records for hospitals . About half of the company 's 200 customers are hospitals and health care organizations scattered throughout Michigan .
So now that BlueWare needs to expand to meet demand and hire an additional 190 workers , Harr has decided to build their company in … Florida .
It 's not that they do n't want to stay where their roots are . It 's just that they need to go where the talent can be found in their industry . And some major tax breaks from their new , adopted state , along with training commitments , do n't hurt , either .
Florida Gov . Rick Scott has set a goal of creating 700,000 jobs in seven years , and he 's pulling out all the stops to do it — including tax refunds and abatements , a strategy that Michigan Gov . Rick Snyder is de-emphasizing in their efforts to attract and retain businesses .
`` Governor Scott themselves called me up and welcomed me to the state even though we 're kind of a small company , '' Harr said .
Harr is under a nondisclosure agreement with Florida , so they could not say exactly what the state offered to move their company to Melbourne , just southeast of Orlando . They did say it was more than simply tax incentives that led them south . It was people — talented former NASA programmers on the so-called Space Coast who are looking for jobs .
`` I just could n't hire people in northern Michigan , '' Harr said . `` Honestly , I 've hired everybody I can . There 's just no more talent . I would interview and interview and interview , and I just could n't come up with the talent that I needed . ''
In the end , talent is what lost BlueWare , said Doug Smith , senior vice president of business and community development at the Michigan Economic Development Corp .
`` I applaud the efforts of Florida , '' Smith said . `` They use their strength — particularly for this one — in having a number of recently unemployed and very skilled NASA engineers to help attract this company .
`` We do n't like to lose any company , particularly one that 's here and established , to an expansion to another state . But I think we certainly win as many as we might lose in the competition because of the labor issue . ''
Talent , Smith said , is actually one of Michigan 's selling points despite the fact that the state has lost some engineering talent over the past four to five years . They point to the state 's `` shifting gears '' program , which helps retrain people to work in smaller business environments , and its recently introduced `` shifting code '' program , designed for `` the critical shortages in the computer programming and IT area . ''
The latter is designed with companies like BlueWare in mind — especially in northern Michigan , where IT talent comes up a bit short .
It was n't that Michigan did not try . The MEDC made counteroffers with tax abatements and a job training commitment of $ 2 million to $ 3 million , Smith said .
But , they said , tax credits are `` from our perspective , a less-than-responsible way to attract companies , '' they said . It has been a theme echoed by Snyder many times .
Indeed , when they spoke in Traverse City in early March , the governor boasted to the local chamber of how they `` got rid of whole business tax credit system .
`` People said you ca n't do that because you have to buy people in our state so they 'll do business here . That 's ridiculous . ''
What has replaced it , Smith said , is a $ 125 million fund that provides loans and grants to companies in the first three years of business rather than the promise of tax breaks farther down the line . That , combined with programs that connect Michigan companies with potential Michigan suppliers and customers , will prove more successful , they said .
`` If we can find you a new customer , that 's as good if not better than any kind of grant or loan guarantee that we can make you , '' Smith said .
Those programs did not do much for BlueWare because the customers are coming as the health care IT industry grows . Harr said BlueWare needed to be in a community that can support their growing company 's needs .
For example , Brevard County in Florida has a program doing all the screening and recruiting for them as they look to hire about 35 people right away .
Neither the city of Cadillac nor state of Michigan could come close to offering these services , they said .
BlueWare will staff its Cadillac office with about 10 people who could not make the move to Florida , but Harr 's advice as they leaf is for the community to learn what IT companies do .
`` Do business with us , understand our business , care about our business , invite us to participate in business , be an advocate for my business .
`` I still love Michigan , '' Harr said . `` I still have my house up there , and my mom and my brothers are up there . It 's still home . But I had to move to work . ''
Skype is an important communication service thanks to its cross-compatibility . There are clients for Mac , Windows , Android , iOS , and even desktop Linux . It may not offer the best user experience , but it is passable , making it a solid choice for those that need to keep in touch across long distances .
Today , Microsoft releases a refreshed preview of Skype for Linux . There are both DEB and RPM packages available , making it easy to install on , say , Ubuntu , Debian , or Fedora . In fact , I successfully installed it on Pop ! _OS earlier today . Believe it or not , the new interface is quite nice , making it something I could possibly enjoy using on my Linux machine .
`` Great news for Skype for Linux users -- the next generation of Skype for Linux is launching ! Starting today , you can download Skype Preview for Linux and start enjoying new features across all your devices -- including screen sharing and group chat . With Skype for Linux , you can take advantage of the screen sharing feature on your desktop screen . Now , you can share content with everyone on the call -- making it even easier to bring your calls to life and collaborate on projects , '' says The Skype Team .
ALSO READ : Ubuntu Linux 17.10 'Artful Aardvark ' Beta 2 now available to download
The team further says , `` The new group chat feature for Skype for Linux allows you to talk with several friends at the same time . We even included options to personalize chats with emoticons , Mojis , and photos so you can express yourself with your own style . It 's a great way to turn your everyday conversations into experiences . The next generation of Skype for Linux is part of our broader strategy to rebuild Skype from the ground up with cloud technology -- a more reliable platform that can scale to a much bigger audience . ''
While some Linux desktop users may be using alternative messaging services , such as the excellent Telegram , I urge them to give Skype a try too . Yes , it is a Microsoft product , and I understand that may deter some , but it is a new world -- the Windows-maker is no longer an enemy to the Linux or open source communities . This new version in particular is quite slick , showing Microsoft actually put some care and effort into the Skype for Linux experience .

The wild gyrations in the stock market on December 18 as the election results for Gujarat came in reminded us that volatility — the two-way movement in asset prices — is not dead . It just took a rather long vacation . Its return this time was in a bit of a cameo role . The volatility lasted for a day , and then the stock market began rising again . However , it may feature more prominently on the playbill in 2018 .
A few things need to be kept in mind when trying to understand volatility . One , the Indian financial markets are not influenced by domestic news and events alone . Reportage and analysis of our market still suffer from a ‘ home country bias ' , a rather misguided search for factors within domestic economic policy or politics to explain market movements .
Look West
As links to the global financial markets have intensified , we increasingly tend to catch a cold when others sneeze . So , it is important to keep a close watch on developments elsewhere , particularly in China , Europe and the US .
Second , markets turn frisky largely on the back of political events and the occasional natural disaster . For ‘ economic ' events to really shake the markets , they have to carry enough heft . Thus , markets could panic if there is a sudden bankruptcy of a large European bank , or exultation if a key US legislation sees the light of day . However , routine economic policy is often anticipated and policymakers take care to prep the markets before the announcement to prevent shocks .
Take monetary policy . There is copious discussion in the financial press and in investment bank research reports on the US central bank 's plan to shrink its balance sheet ( squeeze the dollar liquidity that 's sloshing around ) and keep hiking its ‘ policy ' interest rates in 2018 .
The prospect of the European Central Bank slowly turning off the spigot of cash that it was flooding the markets with has also been parsed down to the last detail . However , these ‘ expectations ' are already baked into asset prices and unless one of these central banks produces a nasty surprise , the policy announcements when they do happen could leave the markets cold .
Why , then , should we fear a more sustained return of volatility in 2018 ? For one thing , there is the business of history and its annoying habit of repeating itself . A study by US fund house Blackrock looks at data on US market volatility from the 1950s and finds that the stock market is all about long stretches of calm followed by sharp rises in market gyrations . Some of the indicators that presage a rise in market turbulence seem well in place .
For instance , the popular Chicago Board Options Exchange ( CBOE ) VIX ( volatility index ) for US stock markets has been stuck at the bottom of its long-term range over the last couple of years . This could be the proverbial calm before a storm , both for the US and our local markets .
What could flip the switch to take the markets from a regime of untrammelled rise to a period of frenzied movement in 2018 ? If political uncertainty is indeed a driver , there 's a long list of major political events due .
Volatility Ahead
In India , there are eight state elections of which four — Karnataka , Madhya Pradesh , Rajasthan and arguably Chattisgarh — are likely to have national ramifications . The results and the phases of anxiety that precede the actual results ( particularly since these would be a bellwether for the 2019 general elections ) could mean both large-scale buying and selling in the markets and drive swings in prices .
Besides , the likely announcement of ‘ vote-catcher ' policies ( a large hike in minimum support prices ( MSPs ) for farm produce , for instance ) in the run-up to the 2019 elections will keep raising the bogey of the fiscal recklessness . While this could dampen the spirits of the market , the predictable repartee from GoI pledging a commitment to fiscal discipline could release an offsetting flood of endorphins . The net result could be periods of weakness in the markets followed by a surge .
International politics might not provide much succour . The US is scheduled for mid-term elections to its two houses of Congress possibly in November . These mid-term elections are generally regarded as a referendum on the sitting president . Going by history , the incumbent party tends to lose ground in such elections .
If the polls hobble Donald Trump 's ability to overhaul laws , they may make an effort to govern through executive order . This could mean that the already fractious US political environment could turn worse .
Meanwhile , the rise of the Eurosceptic , anti-immigrant Right continues . A fractured election mandate last October means that German chancellor Angela Merkel is in no position to read the riot act . Italy is likely to have elections in spring . Markets will try and guess if the mandate could mean yet another referendum on the common market staying intact .
Finally , there is the matter of oil prices . Oil price movements are largely a play both on West Asian politics and Russian President Vladimir Putin 's predilections . While the market consensus is that it will settle at around $ 65 to the barrel , the divergence in forecasts between different forecasts ( Opec and the International Economic Agency ) is cause for concern .
This is not a ‘ view ' on the direction of Indian markets . They could , if the stars so align , gain further over 2018 . But there is enough reason to believe that it might be a steady uphill climb . Investors need to watch for cracks and crevasses .

The best predictions are always made in hindsight . Nostradamus achieved fame by writing down a lot of vague bollocks about the future , and relying on the human brain 's incredible ability to spot links and patterns – even where none exist – to do the rest . Their legacy is a pile of prophecies that are absolutely brilliant at predicting events , as long as they have already happened .
Now Nostradamus has a silicon rival , but while the French seer generated only 900 or so of their quatrains , the University of Tennessee 's `` Nautilus '' supercomputer is capable of spewing out countless millions of predictions – enough to keep an army of cherry-pickers beavering away from now until eternity .
Nautilus trundles through hundreds of millions of news articles , applying sentiment analysis algorithms and place name detection to take a subject and correlate it to a location and a general mood . The theory goes that if `` Brad Pitt '' is mentioned in lots of French articles alongside positive words like `` great '' or `` brilliant '' then the French people must love him , but if `` Hosni Mubarak '' is associated with `` evil '' or `` horrible '' then it 's boom-time for Egyptian pitch-fork manufacturers .
The researcher behind this , Kalev Leetaru , of the University of Illinois , Institute for Computing in the Humanities , Arts and Social Science speculated in their recent paper that by mining this information the system could predict anything from `` forecasting impending conflict to offering insights on the locations of wanted fugitives . ''
These claims were amplified by the BBC , who score many bonus points for linking to the actual paper ( ! ) , but immediately lose them for using the phrase `` scientists say '' to refer to a single researcher ( presumably they forgot to update their template ) and for failing to explain that you probably have more chance of predicting Hosni Mubarak 's next bowel movement than this supercomputer does of anticipating future revolutions .
I 'm not a big fan of sentiment analysis , because every time I try to use it in a practical situation the results that come back are obviously , spectacularly wrong . To illustrate the problem , here 's one I just did for mentions of 'Dorries ' - a term some of you may be familiar with - on Twitter ( you can see a longer version here ) .
Sentiment analysis for 'Dorries ' on Twitter . Longer and bigger version at http : //yfrog.com/keppnp .
The sentiment analysis algorithm reckons that about half the mentions are positive . The sentiment analysis algorithm is talking bollocks . Tweets that the algorithm rates as positive about 'Dorries ' include the following sentimental snippets :
`` I think we should abolish Dorries ''
`` Dorries will lose their seat in the boundary reshuffle ''
`` She is clearly deluding herself '' < -- -- if this is true I 'll be very happy !
`` # dingdongthewitchisgone ''
`` KEEP YOUR FILTHY HANDS OF MY [ * * * * ] YOU HIDEOUS BITCH ''
You can see the problem if you skim through the whole tweets . The algorithm has no concept of context , it just blindly assumes that if 'good ' and 'Pepsi ' appear in the same sentence it must be positive , even if that sentence is actually `` good riddance , Pepsi . ''
Tone of coverage mentioning Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak , Summary of World Broadcasts 1979–2011 . The Y-axis shows standard deviations from the mean . ( Source )
You can see this problem in the paper . A chart ( shown above ) shows a big negative shift in reports about President Mubarak ahead of Egypt 's revolution , as you 'd expect . This is cited as evidence that negative shifts like this could predict revolution , but sentiment was even worse in 1981 when they started their 30-year reign . Were articles about Mubarak then really negative about him , or were they just negative in tone because they set their rise to power in the context of the assassination of their predecessor , President Sadat ?
No attempt is made to investigate the correlation between these shifts in sentiment and subsequent revolutions . Sure , with hindsight we can see that Egypt 's revolution followed a downward trend in media sentiment , but sentiment is very noisy , the scale of the shift is no worse than that seen in the USA between the late 60s and early 70s , and we did n't see a revolution there . Until someone can determine the probability of downtrends preceding revolutions across a decent-sized sample , this is just subjectively interpreted anecdata .
What about the claim that this tool could predict the whereabouts of Osama bin Laden ? The author tells us that :
`` While far from a definitive lock on Bin Laden 's location , global news content would have suggested Northern Pakistan in a 200 km . radius around Islamabad and Peshawar as their most likely location , and that they were nearly twice as likely to be making their residence in Pakistan as Afghanistan . ''
Visualization of geocoded Summary of World Broadcasts content , 1979–2011 , mentioning “ bin Laden ” . ( Source )
I do n't doubt this , but I do n't see that it 's particularly useful or significant result either . A circle of radius 200km covers an area more than 125,000 square kilometers in size . The CIA located bin Laden to within a single compound , so I 'm not sure they 'll be rushing to pick up the phone . In any case , the paper fails to explain why an arbitrary range of 200km is a significant result , or to show why deploying a supercomputer is more effective than just asking a journalist who covers the beat .
The results presented in this paper do n't really make much sense until a human comes along , looks at events , looks at the data , and subjectively interprets the crap out of them until they fit . It 's all very interesting , and I do n't want to disparage the author because they 've generated a lot of very interesting data , but there is n't a single result in this work that demonstrates any ability to predict events - largely because no attempt at a serious statistical analysis has been made .
That 's fine , it 's a speculative result , but it 's a shame the Beeb did n't pick up on this when they decided to run the story under the completely misleading headline 'Supercomputer predicts revolution ' . Like Nostradamus , the predictions of Nautilus are only really successful in hindsight .

Five years have passed since Kanye West rudely interrupted Taylor Swift at the Video Music Awards but he 's back into the headlines for insulting one of the rap industry 's most beloved performers , Tupac Shakur .
In a statement that 's sending shock waves across the music industry , Kanye West dissed Tupac Shakur by calling them the “ most overrated rapper in history ” while chatting after a celebrity showing of Jonathan Liebesman 's newest film , Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles , at the Hollywood Theatre in Hollywood , California .
The gala was hosted by the movie 's stars , Megan Fox and Will Arnett and attendees included a host of musicians and film stars .
The topic of 2Pac came up in conversation when an undisclosed person mentioned to Kanye that their newest studio album , Yeezus , reminded them of Shakur 's breakout record , Strictly 4 My N.I.G.G.A.Z .
Shakur is one of the top selling artists of all-time , with album sales in excess of 75 million and counting , but West is not impressed and did n't appreciate the comparison .
“ How you gon na go compare my music to 2Pac ? ” they said , “ 2Pac was n't any musician . They were an actor . What was they in ? Juice ? Above the Rim ? They were the most overrated rapper in history and you come up in here comparing them to me ? A real rapper…a real star . ”

We are definitely trying to see if this is true or not . If so , this is totally in tune with the type of publicity this man has been getting as of lately . Im sure there are many who agree that 2pac is and was overrated , but a bit surprised if considered the most overrated of all time . For all those who have been following Kanye for the past decade might tell you otherwise . As a producer , and rapper they do have a solid background in Hip Hop , and most likely it 's a comment that got blown out of proportion . As a blogger here , I have respect for both Kanye and Pac . Both men have made classics , and will go down as all-time greats in 50 years from now . I 'm tuned in to the Hip Hop side of things , not the commercial media .
CLOSE Donald Trump is expected to nominate Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers as their secretary of Interior . Find out more about the Washington State Republican representative . USA TODAY NETWORK

BATON ROUGE , La . — President-elect Donald Trump is expected to nominate Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers of Washington as their secretary of Interior , a source close to the transition told USA TODAY Friday .
The timing of the announcement of Rodgers ' selection has not been determined , said the source , who spoke on condition of anonymity because transition officials were not authorized to speak publicly about the nomination .
McMorris Rodgers is chair of the House Republican Conference , which makes them the fourth highest-ranking Republican in the House and the highest-ranking GOP woman in Congress .
News of the pick was swiftly criticized by environmentalists .
League of Conservation Voters President Gene Karpinski said the selection amounted to `` a massive 'for sale ' sign on our public lands . ''
`` McMorris Rodgers has been part of the Republican leadership of the most anti-environmental House of Representatives in history , and they have an abysmal 4 % lifetime score on LCV 's National Environmental Scorecard . They simply should not be put in charge of flight attendanting America 's wildlife , national parks and other majestic landscapes , '' Karpinski continued .
`` At best , Trump can delay the inevitable clean energy revolution , but they ca n't stop it . McMorris Rodgers is clearly not the right choice for a 21st century Department of Interior that will flight attendant public lands on behalf of the American people , '' Greenpeace spokesperson Travis Nichols said .
The Sierra Club also joined in , saying McMorris Rodgers has often voted to open public lands to drilling , mining and logging .
Eric Washburn , a consultant to the Policy Resolution Group — a lobbying firm that represents energy companies — was optimistic that McMorris Rodgers `` will be able to chart a course for the agency that allows for conservation and development to proceed hand in hand . ”
Finding such a balance will be important , Washburn said , because , `` OPEC just got agreement on a supply cut that will raise oil and gas prices and likely lead to more demand to drill on federal lands . ''
The transition team also made another important announcement Friday , but this one was n't who would be in the administration , but rather , who would be out .
Former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani , a Trump loyalist who was considered a top contender for secretary of State , pulled themselves out of the running for any Cabinet position .
`` Before I joined the campaign I was very involved and fulfilled by my work with my law firm and consulting firm , and I will continue that work with even more enthusiasm . From the vantage point of the private sector , I look forward to helping the President-elect in any way they deem necessary and appropriate , '' they said in a statement released Friday afternoon .
Trump said they would continue to seek Giuliani 's guidance and could see them joining the administration in the future .
`` Rudy would have been an outstanding member of the Cabinet in several roles , but I fully respect and understand their reasons for remaining in the private sector , '' Trump said .
Trump 's chief of staff Reince Priebus added that Giuliani was vetted for `` possible conflicts and passed with flying colors . ''
The news of Rodgers ' imminent appointment followed a meeting between Trump and House Speaker Paul Ryan and came on a day when Trump will conduct rallies in Louisiana and Michigan .
The House speaker , who has had an on-again , off-again relationship with Trump during the campaign , has become an enthusiastic supporter following Trump 's win and called the meeting “ very exciting . ”
“ I really enjoyed coming up here and meeting with the president-elect . We had a great meeting to talk about our transition . We are really excited about getting to work and hitting the ground running in 2017 . And getting this country back on track , ” Ryan told reporters at Trump Tower following the meeting .
Before speaking in Baton Rouge , La . Trump had a brief call with First Minister of Scotland Nicola Sturgeon Friday . `` The President-elect and the First Minister look forward to strengthening the relationship between Scotland and the United States , '' a statement released from the transition team said .
In Louisiana , Trump did something relatively unique : Stumped for another candidate .
While congressional and gubernatorial candidates appeared with Trump during the campaign , others declined to appear with him .
They stumped for Louisiana Senate candidate John Kennedy , who is involved in a runoff Saturday .
Louisiana 's Senate seat was not decided on Nov. 8 because of the state 's “ jungle primary system ” which has everyone compete on Election Day . Unless someone gets a majority , the top two candidates ( regardless of party affiliation ) hash it out in a runoff election .
`` If you go to the polls , he 's going to win , '' Trump told a `` Get Out The Vote '' rally in a hangar at the Baton Rouge airport . `` If you do n't go to the polls , he 's not going to win . ''
The president-elect also endorsed U.S. House candidate Mike Johnson .
Trump then headed to Grand Rapids , Mich. , for another rally in their `` Thank You Tour '' of states that gave them the margin of victory in the Electoral College .
Trump has been holding rallies in the battleground states that helped propel them to victory last month .
Michigan was one of the Midwest states that was considered a lock for Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton , but Trump carried the state by about 10,000 votes .
Friday 's meeting with Ryan brings Trump 's number of meetings during the transition to more than 90 , spokesperson Sean Spicer said .
On Monday , they will have four more to add to their list , including former Hewlett-Packard CEO and Republican candidate for president Carly Fiorina . West Virginia Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin was slated to meet with Trump on Friday , but that meeting was rescheduled for Monday because of Manchin 's work in the Senate . Idaho Rep. Raul Labrador and Rick Santorum , a former Pennsylvania senator and candidate for the Republican presidential nomination in 2012 and this year , will also meet with the president-elect .

In a note to correspondents , Mr. Dieng said that between 27 April and 5 May , there were at least six attacks on medical facilities by different parties to the conflict in the north-western governorate of Aleppo alone , marking the “ deadliest ” two weeks since the cessation of hostilities accord , which came into effect on 27 February .
“ These attacks reflect the continued blatant disrespect of international humanitarian law by all parties to the conflict , and may constitute war crimes , ” the Special Adviser stated . “ The international community can not allow the perpetrators of flagrant violations of international humanitarian law and human rights law to enjoy impunity . ”
Mr. Dieng emphasized that just a few days ago , in its Resolution 2286 on health care in armed conflict , the Security Council had reiterated the need for Member States to uphold their obligations under international humanitarian law and ensure that responsible parties are held to account .
“ It is crucial that the Council consistently apply this principle , ” they stressed .
Specifically , Mr. Dieng noted that the attack against the Al Quds Hospital on 27 April reportedly killed 55 civilians , including the last paediatrician in the city , while on 5 May , an attack on the Kamouna Internally Displaced Persons camp in northern Idlib governorate killed at least 30 civilians .
“ Member States have a duty not to fail the Syrian people yet again and to uphold their pledge to protect populations from genocide , war crimes , crimes against humanity and ethnic cleansing , ” the Special Adviser said .
In this respect , they said that the international community should “ step up its commitment ” to end impunity for the perpetrators of the most serious crimes in Syria and thus contribute to preventing new atrocities from being committed .
“ For this reason , I strongly support the Secretary-General 's repeated calls to the Security Council to refer the situation in Syria to the International Criminal Court , ” Mr. Dieng said .
In a humanitarian update , a spokesperson for Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon today noted that on 4 and 8 May , two inter-agency convoys delivered critical life-saving assistance to 3,250 people in the hard-to-reach Syrian town of Qaratien in Rural Homs province , with food , water , sanitation and hygiene supplies , as well as other relief items .
On 6 May , an inter-agency convoy targeting 35,000 people in the hard-to-reach town of Bloudan , in rural Damascus , delivered essential relief items , including water and sanitation , health , hygiene and education supplies . This was the second of two convoys to the town , the first one of which was in mid-March .
Since the beginning of 2016 , inter-agency operations have reached more than 780,000 civilians in need in besieged , hard-to-reach areas and across conflict lines . Many of these people have been reached more than once .
Harry Smith - better known as David Hart / DH Smith in WWE - has just become the latest Assistant Coach in the Scientific Wrestling certification program under Catch As Catch Can Wrestle legend Billy Robinson . I asked Scientific Wrestling founder and fellow Assistant Coach Jake Shannon briefly about Smith and how they hooked up with Billy Robinson as well as what the Assistant Coach title reflects and whether they think Smith will be coaching Catch Wrestling himself :
Harry first met Billy while in Japan and briefly worked out with him , I believe in 2006 . Then when I brought Billy to the US for the first time in early 2007 , Harry came to continue learning . Since then Harry has come to several Certified Catch Wrestler Camps to continue their training .
The assistant coach designation means two things ; first , that you 've logged at least 100 hours of verifiable time training with Billy , and second , that you can teach/demonstrate the concepts to Billy and my approval .
They likely wo n't be teaching due to their WWE schedule but is a becoming a very good grappler .
Smith can actually be seen thrown around by Josh Barnett in the DVD seminar `` W.A.R . Catch Wrestling '' with Billy Robinson .
Along with Jake Shannon , Smith joins only two others who have achieved Assistant Coach level - Sam Kressin , BJJ Blackbelt and MMA trainer , and Jesse Marez , multiple Martial Arts trainer and High School Wrestling Coach . Both Kressin and Marez are based in Southern California .
Billy Robinson originally learned Catch Wrestling at the infamous Wigan Snake Pit under Billy Riley , as well as being an Amateur Wrestling champion that included a British National Championship , and a European Open Championship title after defeating an Olympic Bronze Medalist in the final . Robinson found success Pro Wrestling in Europe , as well as in America ( most notably the AWA ) and in Japan . Robinson went on to become the head coach at the UWFi Snake Pit in Japan where they taught Pro Wrestling and authentic Catch As Catch Can wrestling to notable students such as Kazushi Sakuraba and Josh Barnett .
Robinson 's last Pro Wrestling match was in 1992 with Nick Bockwinkle to help bolster the shoot style pro wrestling movement in Japan , and Robinson was inducted into the International Wrestling Hall of Fame in 2003 , in the Dan Gable Museum in Waterloo , Iowa .
A massive oil find in the heart of west Texas is adding a sense of urgency to Canada 's quest for new oil markets .
`` We watch all discoveries and question what that means for Alberta , '' says Alberta Energy Minister Margaret McCuaig-Boyd .
Alberta Energy Minister Margaret McCuaig-Boyd says Alberta is exploring potential oil markets in India , Asia and Europe . ( Jeff McIntosh/Canadian Press ) `` It just shows us that it 's critical for us , for Alberta and Canada indeed to diversify our markets and get Canadian pipelines to Canadian ports and Canadian tidewater . ''
The Wolfcamp formation is estimated to contain 20 billion barrels of oil , 16 trillion cubic feet of natural gas and 1.6 billion barrels of natural gas liquids , according to the United States Geological Survey .
Though the find is not expected to have a significant effect on prices or markets for Canadian oil in the short term , the Alberta government is paying attention .
The find is another reason why the province is losing interest in the Keystone XL pipeline , which was intended to move Alberta 's oil to refineries along the Gulf of Mexico .
While government and industry are still assessing what is best when it comes to Keystone XL , it 's clear that shipping vast quantities of oil to the United States is no longer the preferred option , McCuaig-Boyd said .
`` They were our biggest customer at one time . They 've now become our biggest competitor . ''
Federal Natural Resources Minister Jim Carr said last week the Keystone XL pipeline has become less of a priority as governments move to expand export markets .
Three times size of North Dakota formation
Wolfcamp is three times the size of the massive Bakken formation that spans North Dakota and parts of Montana , Saskatchewan and Manitoba .
`` It is the largest continuous oil assessment that the USGS has done in the U.S. to date , '' said Stephanie Gaswirth , a geologist with the agency .
( U.S. Geological Survey ) The formation , which surrounds Midland , Texas , near the border with New Mexico , has produced conventional oil for decades .
The new assessment reveals how much more oil and gas can be produced through hydraulic fracturing .
`` Now that industry has the technology to go in with horizontal wells and can hydraulically frack those wells , it makes it feasible to recover the resource in this manner , '' Gaswirth said .
Canadian oil markets safe for now
Experts on both sides of the border said the Wolfcamp formation will not cause any major disruptions to Canadian oil markets in the immediate term .
Robert Skinner , an energy policy expert at the University of Calgary 's school of public policy , called the Wolfcamp news `` an overcooked announcement . ''
The USGS finding is an assessment of potential extractable oil , not a known reserve , they said .
`` It 's not a discovery of new oil . What it is , is an announcement by a government agency that 's looked at some of the shale formations , '' they said . `` It 's not going to be a significant jump in production from this . It 's just , 'Here 's more of this same old oil . ' ``
But Bernard Weinstein , associate director of the Maguire Energy Institute in Dallas , sees it as a far more significant finding that will benefit all of North America .
`` Indeed , if you put Canada , the United States and Mexico together and you look at our reserves and our potential output — we 're another OPEC . ''
Weinstein said Alberta oil will have a role to play in the U.S. energy market regardless of the Wolfcamp development .
The Gulf Coast refineries where some of Alberta 's bitumen is refined are specifically designed to handle heavy oil , they said .
Weinstein said the unknown factor is the cost of producing oil from the Wolfcamp formation .
Because of the downturn in prices , Alberta oilsands producers have worked to reduce the cost of producing oil , and those lower costs may be of benefit as more so-called unconventional oil is poised to enter the marketplace .
( Reuters ) - Semiconductor equipment maker Lam Research agreed to buy rival KLA-Tencor Corp in a deal valued at about $ 10.6 billion , the latest in a string of acquisitions in the chip industry .
KLA-Tencor 's shares , which rose 18.5 percent to $ 63.85 in premarket trading , were still below Lam 's cash-and-stock offer of $ 67.02 per share .
Demand for cheaper chips and new products , as well as a drive by technology companies to consolidate suppliers , has led to record levels of dealmaking in the semiconductor industry this year .
The combined entity , to be helmed by Lam Chief Executive Martin Anstice , will command a 42 percent market share of the wafer fabrication equipment market and have pro forma annual revenue of $ 8.7 billion .
The two companies said they expected to realize $ 250 million in annualized cost savings within 18 to 24 months of closing of the deal and generate about $ 600 million in incremental annual revenue by 2020 .
Both Lam and KLA-Tencor count Samsung Electronics Co Ltd and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd ( TSMC ) as their major customers .
Among the big M & A deals in the semiconductor industry this year , Intel Corp agreed to buy Altera Corp for $ 16.7 billion in June and Avago Technologies Ltd said in May that it would buy Broadcom Corp for $ 37 billion .
Under the deal terms , KLA-Tencor stockholders can opt for $ 32 in cash , or 0.5 of a share of Lam 's common shares , or a combination of two , the companies said in a statement .
Lam 's shares were up 1.7 percent in pre-market trading .
Goldman Sachs is the financial adviser to Lam Research and Jones Day is providing legal counsel . Qatalyst Partners is the financial adviser to KLA-Tencor and Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati is its legal counsel .

The possibilities of data analysis are nearly endless . It could be loading data into neural networks for AIs to analyze , it could be optimizing website layout to increase user visit duration or anything else you can imagine .
With large amounts of data there comes many different ways to process it . You could try it in Excel ( and die before you can fill everything in ) or you could look to more powerful tools . In my experience with data processing and analysis I have used three of the more popular options . They are Matlab , Python and Octave .
Each language ( set of software ? ) has pros and cons that accompany it so we will look at each option in detail . Though this is n't a complete list , I have n't encountered many other data processing tools as commonly used as these . Feel free to comment any that I left out that you would like me to cover and I will update the article .
Matlab
Python
I am definitely biased towards Python . Based on my experience with Python to day I will definitely be using more of it in the future . As a data processing tool Python is exceptional . It has many libraries that will assist in the number crunching . Using what is called Anaconda , a user can manage and install all of the libraries for Python that you could ever need . The best part is that all of the Python libraries are completely free .
When comparing Python to Matlab it is very similar to write the code . The command names and syntax are nearly identical . Python is slightly less user-friendly ( if you do n't use Anaconda ) but it is still manageable for new users .
One of my favorite things about Python is how diverse it is . It is really easy to run C code and a variety of langues from within Python using wrappers . I do know that Matlab can do this as well but it can be really frustrating , especially if it involves Mex files .
Despite being great for number crunching , Python is a complete programming language that is great for object oriented and beginner programming . In recent years , many universities have started switching from teaching Matlab or other data analysis tools to students and replaced it with Python . Why not kill many birds with one stone ? Free , open-source and easily learned . If I could go back and start again , I would have tried to avoid Matlab and used Python instead .
GNU Octave
Octave , oh octave . Have n't used Octave in any amounts recently . The last time I used octave was when it was just starting to have the option for a GUI . I can definitely say I have n't spent enough time with it because from what I have heard it is a great piece of software but my personal experience was very underwhelming .
Octave looks and feels like Matlab , code writes almost the exact same and everything which is n't surprising since it is designed as an open-source equivalent . Like Python and Matlab , you are able to load code from C/C++ , Fortran and other languages to be run from inside Octave . I have never done this with Octave but I am assuming it can be as frustrating as mex files in Matlab .
Performance
Somebody new to data analysis and trying to select what is best for them will say which one should I pick ? For me this would n't be a particularly difficult question since Python is free , fast and does more than just data analysis .
If somebody is worried about execution speed I would n't worry too much about which language you choose . In my experience when using both Python and Matlab for signal processing I found Python to have a slight edge . If performance is that big of an issue once can simply implement C/C++ code into any of the above options to improve performance dramatically .
Alternatives
In recent years I have heard of some great alternatives for data processing . People have been mentioning using R. I have no experience with R but plan on investigating this more in the future .
- Sage Math
- Julia
- R
- Excel ( starts bleeding internally )
What is your weapon of choice for data processing ?
The internet is a sea of servers , data and people . Some of said people have managed to scrape out a living doing data analysis on just about anything they can get their hands on . Data scientists are being hired left right and center to try and improve performance and experience of users . By looking at trends they can determine things like what students in a university course are likely to fail based on their current test scores in the class . This would allow teachers to then help the students before it is too late and they fail courses.Matlab is pretty much the industry standard ( for electrical engineering ) . Though it may be expensive ( $ 2150 USD ) for a personal copy it does have many useful toolboxes . The trick here is that Matlab is the EA ( Electronic Arts ) of the computing world . Almost all of the good toolboxes cost extra and many of the more advanced toolboxes need several other more basic ones first . A toolbox that I would like is the HDL Coder toolbox . Sneaky Matlab makes it so I have to buy three toolboxes to get it and have it be functional.Besides the potential problems with toolbox requirements Matlab is excellent to work with . When describing it to friends I often just say a calculator on steroids . You can do control systems with Matlab but my experience with that has been through Simulink which I would consider a separate tool.The language component of Matlab is very simple to use .

Funkmaster Flex mixed with Dan Le Batard is just as hilarious as you could imagine it . Flex was recently a guest on Le Batard 's show , Highly Questionable , and talked about a various assortment of topics . They of course asked Flex about the floundering Knicks and what it 's like to party with J.R. Smith .
The discussion then turned to hip-hop , when Dan asked Flex who had the worst freestyle in the history of the show . After thinking about it and deliberating for a few moments , Flex came to the conclusion that 2 Chainz took the honor of worst freestyle ever on their show . Flex did clarify the statement though , saying they think they just caught Tity Boi off guard that day . The video of the freestyle is right here , if you want to relive it for yourself .

Did you catch these Doctor Who : The Day of the Doctor details on your first watch through ?
The Day of the Doctor had fans laughing and crying – but in between all of that fangirling and fanboying , did you catch these references to past episodes ? The Doctor Who 50th anniversary episode starred Matt Smith and David Tennant as the Eleventh and Tenth Doctors ( or are they Twelve and Eleven now ? ) alongisde Eight and a Half the Warrior Doctor played by John Hurt . While you were drooling over Tennant 's return , here 's what you missed .
If ‘ The Moment ' sounded familiar , that 's because it was .
The Black Archive was basically the ‘ Doctor Who ' props department .
In David Tennant 's last episode , “ The End of Time : Part Two ” , the President of the Time Lords says , “ He still possesses the Moment . And he 'll use it to destroy Daleks and Time Lords alike . ”
The Black Archive is supposed to hold the most dangerous weapons on Earth . And in keeping with that , here are River Song 's shoes from “ The Time of Angels ” ( we bet their lipstick is around there somewhere ) .
Archived footage just ca n't replace the real thing ( but we knew that ) .
Whereas this is obviously a hugely dangerous weapon , as proven when it broke out hearts and destroyed our souls back in “ Doomsday ” .
The Museum is basically the curator 's TARDIS .
All 13 Doctors may have turned up to save Gallifrey , but that did n't stop the Seventh Doctor ( Sylvester McCoy ) from taking a minute for an outfit change .

We now know why Queen Elizabeth hates the Doctor .
That 's right , those are round things on the walls . And no , we still do n't know what they do . Is “ the Curator ” simply a new title in the place of an old one , like say , “ the Doctor ” ?
sexual
Also why one of their nicknames might not be appropriate
We all wondered about thetension in “ The Shakespeare Code ” . But getting married to the Queen of England , and then never coming back after you promised that you would ? Yeah , that would do it .
And does that make the Doctor the King of England ?
No one tell Eight and a Half/the Warrior Doctor/John Hurt that Ten was getting it on with the Queen , they did n't even like seeing them kiss .

Because never dying does create certain problems for the chain of succession . And the whole idea of a monarchy .
Why are a bunch of pro-housing , tower-loving , millennials staging a hostile takeover of the Sierra Club ? I mean , what 's wrong with these obnoxious kids ?
Well , let me tell you . Like most people in San Francisco , we 're frustrated over the cost of housing .
How much ink has been spilled about the astronomical rent and its horrific impact on low-income San Franciscans ? How much ink has been spilled over stunted millennials and their perpetual strugglefests ? How much ink has been spilled over the endless evictions and displacement , as minority , low- and middle-income people are pushed further and further away from this great engine of opportunity , San Francisco ?
If , like me , you believe that the root cause of this spike in rents is a housing shortage , then you may agree that the local Sierra Club chapter has been a locus for anti-housing nonsense and is in dire need of fresh , green blood .
Luxury Real Estate interests already control the local Sierra Club . They are wealthy homeowners who prioritize their own sense of beauty over everything else . These homeowners live in “ luxury housing ” — and , thanks to 1978 's Proposition 13 , pay disproportionately less toward local services than newcomers , including their own children .
The local Sierra Club leadership has been working very hard to oppose density in this city for decades . They argue they are protecting pretty communities , that development is bad for the environment , and that building housing directly causes displacement . I do n't agree .
What does the National Sierra Club have to say about building housing in cities like San Francisco ? In their Growth Management Guidelines , they say “ The Club will not support local growth initiatives that discourage infill and affordable housing . For example , the Club will not support initiative efforts by community groups that seek to stop or overturn multi-family ( e.g. , apartment ) development projects , or subject affordable housing projects to public vote or onerous conditions . ”
The local chapter of the Sierra Club in San Francisco opposed Mission Rock , a 40 % affordable housing project that will turn a vast parking lot into a mixed use community with about 1,400 new homes . They opposed a project at Parkmerced , with 5,679 new homes and transit improvements . The chapter 's leadership often decides that a sliver of shadow on a public park is more of an environmental danger than the displacement of hundreds . This can not continue .
The economic literature is clear : if we do n't build enough homes in San Francisco , housing prices will rise and displacement will continue . By not building in our transit-rich suburbs and neighborhoods , we encourage suburban sprawl and migration to less environmentally-friendly regions . People who live in denser cities use less water , drive less , and consume less electricity . Urbanization is green . Suburbanization is not . One or the other will happen .
This does n't mean we pave over our beautiful parks . It means we take old warehouses , parking lots and single-story retail spots and build apartment buildings with vibrant businesses on the ground floor . It means we allow more housing in our single-family home only neighborhoods . It means we build more of the city we love .
We are members of the Sierra Club . We had a volunteer design a cute mailer . We publicized the fact that we think the current Sierra Club chapter is on the wrong track and needs new leadership . The Yes In My Back Yard ( YIMBY ) Party is staging an intervention , and , as expected , it has not received a very warm reception .
But the Sierra Club needs to be a strong voice for the future of our cities . We need to fundamentally retrofit San Francisco and the Bay Area with dramatically more housing and public transportation . Housing needs to be built in every neighborhood in San Francisco , so that every neighborhood gets both the costs and the benefits of more people .
Win or lose , we intend to do this again next year . We will run a slate every year until our local Sierra Club gets back on track . Because the interconnected issues of global warming and urban housing are n't going anywhere . And neither are we .
Unless we , too , get displaced . …

Sidereal and tropical are astrological terms used to describe two different definitions of a year . They are also used as terms for two systems of ecliptic coordinates used in astrology . Both divide the ecliptic into a number of `` signs '' named after constellations , but while the sidereal system defines the signs based on the fixed stars , the tropical system defines it based on the position of vernal equinox in the northern hemisphere ( i.e. , the intersection of the ecliptic with the celestial equator ) . Because of the precession of the equinoxes , the two systems do not remain fixed relative to each other but drift apart by about 1.4 arc degrees per century . The tropical system was adopted during the Hellenistic period and remains prevalent in Western astrology . A sidereal system is used in Hindu astrology , and in some 20th century systems of Western astrology .
While classical tropical astrology is based on the orientation of the Earth relative to the Sun and planets of the solar system , sidereal astrology deals with the position of the Earth relative to both of these and the stars of the celestial sphere . The actual positions of certain fixed stars as well as their constellations is an additional consideration in the horoscope .
History [ edit ]
The classical zodiac was introduced in the neo-Babylonian period ( around the seventh to the sixth century BCE ) . At the time , the precession of the equinoxes had not been discovered . Classical Hellenistic astrology consequently developed without consideration of the effects of precession . The discovery of the precession of the equinoxes is attributed to Hipparchus , a Greek astronomer active in the later Hellenistic period ( ca . 130 BCE ) .
Ptolemy , writing some 250 years after Hipparchus , was thus aware of the effects of precession . They opted for a definition of the zodiac based on the point of the vernal equinox , i.e. , the tropical system . While Ptolemy noted that Ophiuchus is in contact with the ecliptic , they were aware that the 12 signs were just conventional names for 30-degree segments .
The Hindu Jyotisha system opted for defining the zodiac based on the fixed stars , i.e. , directly tied to the eponymous zodiacal constellations , unlike Western astrological systems .
Sidereal traditions [ edit ]
Hindu astrology [ edit ]
Traditional Hindu astrology is based on the sidereal or visible zodiac , accounting for the shift of the equinoxes by a correction called ayanamsa . The difference between the Vedic and the Western zodiacs is currently around 24 degrees . This corresponds to a separation of about 1,700 years , when the vernal equinox was approximately at the center of the constellation Aries ( `` First Point of Aries '' ) , and the tropical and sidereal zodiacs coincided ( around CE 290 , or at 23.86° as of 2000 ) . The separation is believed to have taken place in the centuries following Ptolemy ( second century CE ) , apparently going back to Indo-Greek transmission of the system . But earlier Greek astronomers like Eudoxus spoke of a vernal equinox at 15° in Aries , while later Greeks spoke of a vernal equinox at 8° and then 0° in Aries ( cf . p. 16 , S. Jim Tester in ref . ) , which suggests the use of a sidereal zodiac in Greece before Ptolemy and Hipparchus .
Sidereal western astrology [ edit ]
Some western astrologists have shown interest in the sidereal system during the 20th century .
Shifted zodiac [ edit ]
Cyril Fagan assumed the origin of the zodiac to be based on a major conjunction that occurred in 786 BC , when the vernal equinox lay somewhere in mid-Aries [ 1 ] corresponding to a difference of some 39 degrees or days .
Most sidereal astrologers simply divide the ecliptic into 12 equal signs of 30 degrees but approximately aligned to the 12 zodiac constellations . Assuming an origin of the system in 786 BC , this results in a system identical to that of the classical tropical zodiac , shifted by 25.5 days , i.e. , if in tropical astrology Aries is taken to begin at March 21 , sidereal Aries will begin on April 15 .
Astronomic zodiac [ edit ]
A small number of sidereal astrologers do not take the astrological signs as an equal division of the ecliptic , but define their signs based on the actual width of the individual constellations . They also include constellations that are disregarded by the traditional zodiac , but are still in contact with the ecliptic .
Stephen Schmidt in 1970 introduced Astrology 14 , a system with additional signs based on the constellations of Ophiuchus and Cetus .
In 1995 , Walter Berg introduced their 13-sign zodiac , which has the additional sign of Ophiuchus . Berg 's system was well received in Japan after their book was translated by radio host Mizui Kumi ( 水井久美 ) in 1996 .
For the purpose of determining the constellations in contact with the ecliptic , the constellation boundaries as defined by the International Astronomical Union in 1930 are used . For example , the Sun enters the IAU boundary of Aries on April 19 at the lower right corner , a position that is still rather closer to the `` body '' of Pisces than of Aries . The IAU defined the constellation boundaries without consideration of astrological purposes .
The dates the Sun passes through the 13 astronomical constellations of the ecliptic are listed below , accurate to the year 2011 . The dates will progress by an increment of one day every 70.5 years . The corresponding tropical and sidereal dates are given as well .

On May 14 , 1889 , the North Carolina Granite Company was founded in Surry County by Thomas Woodroffe . It has been in continuous operation since . Now known as the North Carolina Granite Corporation , it is the world 's largest open-faced granite quarry .
The site has produced granite for many high rise buildings and even for the Singapore subway system . Its granite has been used to create several notable structures including the Fort Knox Bullion Depository in Kentucky , the Wright Brothers Monument at Kitty Hawk , the Centennial Olympic Plaza in Atlanta and the World War II Memorial in Washington , D.C .
The granite is also popular for curbing , especially in northern states that use salt in winter , since salt breaks down concrete curbs in short order . Other uses for the product include tombstones and mausoleums . Waste granite , the small bits that are left over from extraction and from fabrication , is crushed for road construction and landscape use .
Located on the Ararat River near Mt . Airy , the active quarry covers more than 200 acres and is estimated to have enough granite to continue extracting it at the current rate for 500 more years . The quarry is the source of Mt . Airy 's ” Granite City ” nickname .

Debbie Wasserman Schultz used their position on a committee that oversees the budget of the Capitol Hill police to attend a budget hearing and question the police chief about a laptop they say the police should return to them When the police chief said they could n't return it , Wasserman Schultz suggested there would be “ consequences. ” From the Daily Caller :
“ My understanding is the the Capitol Police is not able to confiscate Members ' equipment when the Member is not under investigation , ” Wasserman Schultz said in the annual police budget hearing of the House Committee On Appropriations ' Legislative Branch Subcommittee . “ We ca n't return the equipment , ” Police Chief Matthew R. Verderosa told the Florida Democrat . “ I think you 're violating the rules when you conduct your business that way and you should expect that there will be consequences , ” Wasserman Schultz said .
The text does n't really convey the tone of the exchange . Wasserman Schultz is giving the police chief the third degree at a budget meeting . Here 's video of the exchange :
The Capitol Hill police are investigating procurement theft involving equipment stolen from as many as 20 members of Congress . The thefts were allegedly carried out by a Pakistani IT specialist named Imran Awan and several members of their family . Awan has worked for Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz as a technology adviser since 2005 so it is believed that their office could be involved in the investigation , though no arrests have been made .
According to a source who spoke to the Daily Caller , the laptop in question was used by Awan and was found “ hidden in an unused crevice of the Rayburn House Office Building. ” Wasserman Schultz ' office is in the Longworth building . Police seized the laptop believing it could be important to their investigation . Obviously , Wasserman Schultz is claiming the laptop belongs to them and therefore should be returned regardless of who was using it or what information might be on it .
Monday the Daily Caller reported that Awan 's wife had left the country and moved to Pakistan .

Snow on tha Bluff is a 2012 reality/drama film directed by Damon Russell . It is the story of Curtis Snow , a real Atlanta `` robbery boy and crack dealer whose livelihood revolves around armed robbery and drug pushing '' who `` sought out [ director ] Damon Russell to make a film about their life '' . The film 's title refers to protagonist Curtis Snow and to Atlanta 's neighborhood The Bluff , which is infamous for crime and drug dealing .
Synopsis [ edit ]
Three college students drive to the new Bluff , an Atlanta neighborhood , intending to buy some drugs from a dealer . Clearly naive , they joke about flirting in hopes of getting free drugs , and reassure one another that they have nothing to fear . One of the students holds a camera with the hope of filming the encounter . They find a dealer named Curtis Snow , who asks them to drive them to their house in order to fulfill their order . Once they arrive , Curtis pulls out a gun , robs them of their purses and camera , and makes a hasty escape . Recognizing the quality of the camera , they hand it to one of their friends , telling them to continue filming no matter what in order to capture their day-to-day life as it occurs .
Curtis soon learns that another group of drug dealers have encroached on their territory , selling drugs not far from their street . They recruit their friends and robs the rivals of their drug supply . When a friend tips them off to another gang selling drugs nearby , they invade their house with the help of their friend and robs them of their supply as well .
While playing at a pool hall , Curtis recognizes a rival drug dealer with their familiar white hat , who likewise takes note of Curtis . The man in the white hat follows Curtis into their territory , asking the locals about him , but the surface threat does n't faze Curtis and they continue to hustle . On their way back home after cutting the latest stolen product with their crew , Curtis is ambushed in a backyard alleyway by a gunman seconds after looking `` white hat '' in the eye . Luckily the bullet wounds are not fatal and the ambusher 's gun jams right as they come close to Curtis , allowing them to flee . They collapse in the street nearby , where they are found by a police patrol and subsequently arrested in connection with a prior robbery , and spends four months in jail .
After their release from jail , Curtis is enthusiastically welcomed back by their neighborhood , and is clearly anxious to get right back into the drug dealing game . They attempt to get revenge by ambushing `` white hat 's '' girlfriend , but in retaliation , they kill their girlfriend and mother of their child . Them death causes Curtis to sink into depression , as they now have to take care of their young son while continuing to deal drugs . In one scene , as they cut and bags up crack to sell , they explain how they watched their uncle do exactly the same thing when they were a kid , and comments that their son is the same age they were and watching them engage in the same behavior .
Soon after , however , Curtis meets a friend to discuss up-to-date information on a mark . En route to shakedown this dealer , the car that they 're in is once again ambushed by rival gang members . Curtis and their crew return fire then give chase only to be intercepted by the police , causing everyone to bail on foot . Returning home after losing the police , Curtis is enraged by the turn of events and wrecks a room , then quietly smokes pot and watches their son play in the debris .
The movie ends with Curtis calling a number from an ad they found about movie editing . They tell them they have a movie for them and makes a meeting . It 's obvious that their movie idea is for `` Snow on tha Bluff . ''

Producer Chris Knittel utilized a series of unorthodox guerrilla marketing techniques .

From there , I would send out the tapes with no return address to politicians , conservative groups , police stations and various factions in the media . Operation “ stir up shit , ” was now in progress . '' [ 8 ]

As they were driven back to their opulent palace in Harare on Tuesday , surrounded by bodyguards in military fatigues and wearing motorcycle helmets , Robert Mugabe had no reason to suspect that their 37-year rule was about to end .
Having been in power since 1980 , Mugabe — not to mention Grace , their high-handed , grasping second wife — thought they were invincible . Just days earlier , they beamed with satisfaction at a ceremony to change the name of Zimbabwe 's main airport to the Robert Mugabe International Airport .
They believed they would be president of the former British colony until they died , and had once proclaimed 'not even God ' wanted their murderous reign to end . Their wife , meanwhile , had called for a Mugabe family 'dynasty ' to run the country for ever .
Slumbering : Mugabe , 93 , at a graduation ceremony on Friday
But what neither knew that sunny afternoon was that Mugabe 's loyal presidential guard had been swapped for military personnel who were in league with their enemies — the very generals who had previously been loyal to the despot since they came to power after the bush war against white rule .
The first sign of any trouble was when Mugabe 's convoy arrived at their home in a suburb of the capital city , and the men accompanying them arrested the security officers on duty there .
The 93-year-old president was then hustled into the house and , a short time later , the man in charge of Zimbabwe 's armed forces arrived to break some rather bad news to Mugabe .
A fearsome individual known for their volcanic temper , General Constantino Chiwenga is one of the so-called 'Dirty Half Dozen ' — six sinister military and intelligence chiefs whose junta has kept Mugabe in office for decades , terrorising opponents and rigging elections .
Bluntly , Chiwenga told Mugabe they were under arrest . Without uttering a word , Mugabe promptly collapsed to the floor .
'He was in shock , and collapsed when they realised what was happening , ' one coup plotter told me . 'He had to be resuscitated and revived . They could not believe what was happening at first . '
Grace — with whom the president had begun an affair after spotting them in their typing pool when they were still married to their first wife — was terrified . They were hysterical and burst into tears .
According to one who was told about the unfolding events : 'She 's been in a mess ever since — in tears and mentally gone . They begged to be allowed to fly out to Malaysia [ where they have millions in investments ] . They thought they would be killed . '
After being revived — Mugabe has a history of fainting fits and falling asleep at Cabinet meetings — the president and the general began a tense discussion . By then , dozens of other senior army personnel had arrived at the presidential palace .
Beijing 's billions flood Zimbabwe . This is what the money was spent on
Realising how perilous their position was , Mugabe made an astonishing bid to save their own political skin — and possibly their life .
Incredibly , they promised General Chiwenga they would anoint them the next president if they called off the coup and stood down as the head of the armed forces .
In a last desperate throw of the dice to cling to power , they told Chiwenga that they would immediately be appointed Mugabe 's vice-president and that they would take over as Zimbabwe 's leader when Mugabe eventually dies .
Even then , Mugabe , a sly old fox who has long played factions off each other to remain in power , had one condition : that Grace should have a prominent role in a future government . General Chiwenga flatly turned down the offer .
Apart from anything else , it was too late by then . More than 30 army personnel carriers and 21 tanks had earlier in the day moved into key strategic locations . Mugabe loyalists , in the police and military , had been ordered back to barracks 24 hours earlier and prevented from leaving .

The truth is that Mugabe had sealed their own fate . Their mistake was to bow to pressure from Grace — who wanted to take over as president after their death — to purge their rivals for the crown .
Those on their list of enemies in particular included a man called Emmerson Mnangagwa , a veteran of the bush war and the man who believed it was their destiny to take power .
Known as 'Ngwenya ' — or The Crocodile — Mnangagwa was for decades one of Mugabe 's closest allies , running their fearsome intelligence wing as well as being in charge of defence , before being appointed vice-president in 2014 .
Grace believed Mnangagwa was their only rival for power — and made a decisive move against them last week , stripping them of their vice-presidency , and calling for their rival 's demise .
' A snake is better dealt with by crushing the head , ' Grace told a political rally less than two weeks ago . Mnangagwa 's 'head must be crushed . I will personally make sure Mnangagwa is dealt with even if everyone else in the party is scared . I will not be intimidated . '
Mugabe and Grace also accused Mnangagwa of using 'witchcraft ' against them .

But Mrs Mugabe chose the wrong man to fight . An architect of the so-called Gukurahundi massacres in the Eighties , in which more than 20,000 from the Ndebele tribe were brutally slaughtered because of their allegiance to an opposition party , Mnangagwa commands huge support in the army and among war veterans .
After their summary sacking a few days ago , fearing they would be arrested or killed by Mugabe loyalists , The Crocodile tried to flee Zimbabwe .
They and their security detail were denied entry to Harare airport , so they could not fly out from there . Mnangagwa and their allies then tried to charter a private jet to arrive from South Africa to pick them up — but Mugabe 's authorities denied the craft permission to enter Zimbabwean airspace .
So The Crocodile and their men were forced to drive east and cross into neighbouring Mozambique via old smuggling routes used by bush fighters . From there , they headed to South Africa .
In secret conversations with their army comrades , Mnangagwa decided to activate a plan they had mapped out to remove the ageing Mugabe from power .
The coup would be carried out in Zimbabwe — but it was made in China .
For I can reveal that , after secret telephone discussions with their ally General Chiwenga back in Zimbabwe , Mnangagwa boarded another aircraft — this time headed for Beijing . They were to be a guest of the Chinese government .
Around the same time , General Chiwenga informed Mugabe they had routine business in China , which has supported Mugabe 's regime for years with cash and weapons in return for access to its lucrative diamond mines and other minerals .
They also flew out to Beijing .
So it was that Mnangagwa and Chiwenga discussed their plans with Chinese officials . It 's instructive to learn that both men had been trained at China 's Nanjing Military School .
The two Zimbabweans had also been the architects of many of the lucrative deals struck between China and Harare , including a multi-billion-pound diamond mining deal , which could have made the country rich , but instead was riddled with rampant corruption , with some £15 billion believed to have been pilfered in one year alone .
The Chinese built the Zimbabwe National Defense College
In truth , the Chinese do not really care who is in charge of Zimbabwe — as long as their business and strategic interests are taken care of .
It is part of China 's African-wide strategy of propping up corrupt regimes in return for access to the minerals and oil the Chinese need to supply their vastly expanding economy .
Beijing had long feared that Mugabe 's refusal to anoint their successor would mean there could be chaos once they died , threatening their investments which , significantly , include a £100 million new spy college in Harare for Zimbabwe 's ruling party .
So began a global power play against Mugabe , known as 'the Old Man ' throughout Zimbabwe . With the Chinese pledging to back the new regime after the coup , both American and Russian intelligence were also told of the plans .
Diplomatic sources claim the Americans were happy for Mugabe to be replaced as long as there was no bloodshed , and a smooth transition to the new regime . ( Britain , scandalously , had helped prop up Mugabe for years over fears of instability if they were ousted , having helped to install them in 1980 . )
With key global players in agreement , the secret strategy to deal with Mugabe — which The Crocodile was told must appear to the world not to be a coup — was activated . Military forces were recalled to barracks ; a list of prominent Mugabe cronies and their whereabouts was produced .
Meanwhile , General Chiwenga flew back from China and held a meeting with Mugabe on Monday night — 24 hours before the military action began . They warned the president that the 'purges ' against their wife 's rivals must end .
Not realising the scale of the threat , Grace , who was present at the meeting , was furious . They told the general that they and their husband would have them fired and replaced as head of the army by the leader of the presidential guard .
Chinese money built Zimbabwe 's new £35million parliament
Once again , Grace 's hectoring aggression only served to spur their enemies to action . So it was that tanks rolled through the streets of Harare this week .
While Mugabe and Grace were placed under house arrest , military units swooped and arrested key loyalists such as Jonathan Moyo , Mugabe 's higher education minister , and Ignatius Chombo , their finance chief , who was discovered trying to pack $ 10 million in banknotes into bags when they were seized .
Along with police chiefs loyal to Mugabe , these men are now being held at secret military detention facilities around the country and face prosecution and long jail terms in some of Zimbabwe 's most gruesome penal institutions .
Yet what none of the plotters were prepared for was Mugabe 's refusal to step down .
The plan was that , having reinstated The Crocodile as their vice-president , they would be compelled to announce their resignation , leaving their rival to take over .
However , during hours of discussions with their captors this week , Mugabe has refused offers to be flown out of the country , or provided with state security and allowed to live quietly in Zimbabwe . But then they are deeply stubborn and still can not imagine giving up their position or privileges .
Anxious to adhere to China 's insistence that there should be no violence , and despite calls by some hardline opponents to kill the president and their wife , the generals have not harmed Mugabe , or Grace , who remains under house arrest with their husband in Harare , in spite of reports that they had fled to neighbouring Namibia .
'We can not hold a gun to their head , ' one military source told me . 'As the days have gone by , they have become more and more argumentative . They say what the generals are doing is against the constitution and that they are the ones causing instability . They are getting rather hot-headed . '
Honor guards wait for the arrival of President of Zimbabwe Robert Mugabe in front of the Parliament building in 2006
So what now for poor , benighted Zimbabwe , which has gone from being the breadbasket of Africa to an economic basketcase ?
Supporters of The Crocodile , who returned to Zimbabwe on Thursday , remain confident they can persuade Mugabe to stand down in the coming days , particularly given the fragile mental state of their wife .
Then , if they do stand down , this will be presented as a smooth transition to a new government of national unity .
As for Mugabe , their one remaining hope is that other African cronies will step in to save him . Fearing military interventions against their own corrupt regimes , figures such as South Africa 's Jacob Zuma and Uganda 's Yoweri Museveni have described the coup as unconstitutional , with Zuma sending envoys to meet Mugabe and the 'coup leaders ' on Thursday .
As part of a complicated , elaborate charade , The Crocodile and their generals even allowed Mugabe out to attend a university graduation ceremony in Harare yesterday — before they were returned to house arrest with Grace .
It appears Mugabe was allowed to attend the event to give the appearance at least that they are not the victim of a coup .
But by last night , all of the Zimbabwean provinces that once supported Mugabe had called for their resignation , meaning the former president can be recalled to government and compelled to stand down . 'The Croc trained as a lawyer , ' one loyalist told me . 'He 's smart and wants the military coup to be seen as a political coup . '

For the first time in living memory , the new military leaders have given permission for a huge march planned for today in Harare , which is expected to be attended by tens of thousands calling for Mugabe to step down , signalling new freedoms .
Previous attempts at protest have been crushed by Mugabe 's police . This is all intended to show the international community that the people of Zimbabwe want Mugabe gone .
Fearing outside military intervention , not to mention a fightback from Mugabe loyalists , the military leaders here have set up army road blocks around the country , with searches carried out of all vehicles for weapons or suspected enemies of the new regime .
As part of the attempts to make the coup not appear to be a coup , the military on the streets have been told to win hearts and minds . Whereas Mugabe 's police were allowed to extract bribes from motorists , the soldiers I met at more than a dozen roadblocks this week were professional and polite .
After years of poverty and brutality under Mugabe 's regime , most people here are celebrating their downfall , even though there are fears the new regime will be just as bad , albeit with a new leader .
'We have got rid of a snake and replaced it with a new snake , ' said Gibson Lovemore , a street vendor .
'But we wanted to rid of the old man and need change . This has gone on too long . '
As darkness fell on Zimbabwe last night , and thunder and lightning crackled around the capital , the future of the country hung in the balance . But one thing seems clear . The monstrous despot who has ruled with an iron fist for so long is still refusing to give up .
With less than six months to go before Scotland goes to the polls to elect a new Holyrood Parliament , our new poll for STV News shows the SNP still significantly ahead while the Scottish Conservatives have gained ground .
Among those likely to vote , 50 % would cast their constituency vote for the SNP ( down five points from August 2015 ) , while 20 % would vote for Scottish Labour ( no change ) with the support for the Scottish Conservatives just a further two points adrift on 18 % ( up six points ) . The Scottish Liberal Democrats remain at 7 % support .
The pattern is similar for the party list vote , with 46 % backing the SNP ( down four points from August ) , while Labour drop one point to 19 % . Again , the main beneficiaries are the Scottish Conservatives who gain four points and move to 16 % . The Scottish Liberal Democrats register 8 % support ( up one point ) with the Scottish Greens at 7 % ( down one point ) .
First Minister Nicola Sturgeon continues to be Scotland 's most popular party leader , although their personal ratings have dropped a little since August . Two-thirds of Scots ( 67 % ) are satisfied with their performance compared to 28 % who are dissatisfied , giving a net satisfaction score of +39 % ( down 9 points ) . In line with Scottish Conservative support increasing , their party leader Ruth Davidson has seen a jump in net satisfaction ratings from +9 % in August to +14 % now . Scottish Labour leader Kezia Dugdale has also seen their personal ratings improve from +1 % in August to +4 % now .
On the issue of forthcoming referendum on Britain 's membership of the European Union ( EU ) , almost two-thirds of Scots ( 65 % ) report that they would to remain in the EU with 22 % voting to leave and 13 % saying they do n't know . This contrasts with our latest GB-wide polling on the issue from August where support to remain in the EU was lower ( 52 % ) while 36 % wanted to leave .
Mark Diffley , Director at Ipsos MORI Scotland said :
`` This latest poll continues to show the SNP in a commanding position despite losing some ground after a bruising few weeks . Interestingly , it is the Scottish Conservatives who benefit and they are now seriously challenging Labour as the main challenger to the SNP ahead of the Holyrood vote next May . On the forthcoming EU referendum it is notable that opinion in Scotland is firmly in favour in the UK remaining part of the WU while opinion south of the border appears to be moving in the opposite direction . It does of course remain possible that the UK could vote to leave the EU against the wishes of Scottish voters , a scenario with implications for a possible second independence referendum . ''
Technical note :
theScore 's multi-part team previews include a look at something that separates each team from the pack . From specific breakouts to powerplay formations and beyond , Justin Bourne and Thomas Drance hope to highlight something you have n't noticed in the past .
What we noticed
When Dustin Byfuglien was drafted into the NHL , it was as a defenseman . Then Chicago made them a forward , except when they needed an extra D-man . Then the Thrashers/Jets picked them up , and they played D , then forward , then D , then forward . As it stands , he 's heading into next year as a forward .
This is a unique situation to be in with a player ; basically only the San Jose Sharks can relate with Brent Burns . These guys are true rovers .
With Byfuglien being such a massive part of the Jets success and/or failures , it 's integral that they get the most out of their skill set .
Below I 'll lay out the pros and cons of using them at both positions , with a conclusion drawn at the bottom . Come along for the ride , wo n't you ?
Dustin Byfuglien should be a forward
Dustin Byfuglien should absolutely be a forward . There 's a reason the San Jose Sharks moved Brent Burns to forward permanently - when you get manimals like these two , you do n't want them sitting back with the play in front of them , you want them in the midst of the muck , making life difficult for their opponents .
When Byfuglien was on the ice as a forward at even-strength , the Jets were only outscored by four goals at even strength in 32 games . When they were playing D , they were outscored by 18 in 46 .
They started to put together some nice chemistry with Blake Wheeler last year . The team has Zach Bogosian and Jacob Trouba at right defense , meaning they 're far better off plugging a hole in their depth chart at right wing then on the back end .
It 's pretty obvious - there 's a reason two smart coaches have made them a forward .
Dustin Byfuglien should n't be a forward
Dustin Byfuglien simply should n't be a forward . Actually , it 's not even that they should n't be , they ca n't . They get absolutely obsessed with the puck , which means you 're left with shifts like the two in the frames below .
Excuse all the pics , but yeah - check the game clock so you 'll believe me this was all in a span of two shifts in the same game .
Below , their D-man is spread out wide , but they want to help block the shot , maybe .
Also he 'd like to play center .
They break their stick and heads to the bench , to return to right wing . ... Sorta . He 's certainly not worried about the slot .
And he 'd like the puck , which is nowhere near their side of the ice .
And if you wo n't give it to him , dammit , he 'll go get it himself .
Their next shift ?
Their linemates spend the majority of their shifts figuring out how to rotate while they aimlessly rovers around .
Dustin Byfuglien should be a defenseman
Dustin Byfuglien should absolutely be a defenseman . He 's better than people think at actually defending , where he 's efficient at keeping players on the paint with body position and a good reach .
That leads to physical puck battles , which is a strength of their game . They still produce as a defenseman , and production from the point is something recent Cup winners have had in common . It 's of huge value .
The zone entry/exit data is overwhelmingly complimentary of them playing D. They rarely turn the puck over , and clears the zone well . Opponents do n't go down their side as often as they do their most frequent partner ( Tobias Enstrom ) , and for a reason .
Most staggering is their ability to gain the opposing blue line with control from the rear . The following list of 20 D-men had over 40 controlled zone entries over the roughly 48 game per-player sample put together by Corey Sznajder ( Carolina Hurricanes skaters excluded excluded ) :
Victor Hedman , Drew Doughty , Andrew MacDonald , Travis Hamonic , Mike Green , Alex Pietrangelo , P.K . Subban , Keith Yandle , Sami Vatanen , Jake Gardiner , Morgan Rielly , Justin Schultz , Brian Campbell , Kris Letang , Nick Leddy , Jared Spurgeon , Alex Goligoski , Erik Karlsson , Seth Jones and Roman Josi . And Dustin Byfuglien .
Among those names , only three players ' teams generated shots more efficient off of their entries : Doughty 's , Pietrangelo 's and Spurgeon 's .
And finally , when they played D the Jets had a 52 % share of shot attempts when they were on the ice . When they played forward , they saw a 48 % share .
The big boy is pretty effective back there .
Dustin Byfuglien should n't be a defenseman
It 's pretty obvious Dustin Byfuglien should n't be a defenseman . Maybe they could play D on a team with an actual NHL starting goalie , but not in front of Ondrej Pavelec . The reality is that Byfuglien is prone to substantial brain cramps , which means when they mess up - which is probably just as often as most D-men - they mess up bad , which is different from most D-men . If you have a goalie who can bail you out on those mental explosions here and there , you 're fine . It simply does n't happen in Winnipeg .
As a defender , Byfuglien just does n't do a good enough job getting into players . To wit :
When Dustin Byfuglien has been on the ice playing D the last three years , Jets goalies managed only a .908 save percentage ( it was at .880 last season ) . When they were on the ice as a forward for the last 32 games a year ago , Jets goalies posted a .917 . Call it luck , but I say they simply give shooters too much room .
The conclusion
Dustin Byfuglien is a seriously good hockey player , and he 's going to help your team either way , but they should be playing defense .
Like a good quarterback , they seem to be able to take over the game from there . The added offensive punch you 're getting from them as a forward is n't exactly huge , while having a big point producer occupy a spot on the roster you 'd normally get near nothing from increases the value of their contribution .
Unlike Burns he 's not overtaking anyone with speed up front , but they can control the game from the back . They have patience with the puck that brings the game to their pace and allows them to remain offensively dangerous while playing D. He 's not going to hurt you as a forward , arguably they might hurt you a bit less , but you 're going to get more out of them as a defenseman .
For the dinosaur , see Balaur bondoc
Balaur
A balaur is a creature in Romanian folklore , similar to a European dragon . [ 1 ] A balaur is quite large , has fins , feet , and is polycephalous ( it usually has three , sometimes seven , or even twelve serpent heads ) . [ 2 ] As a traditional character which is found in most Romanian fairy tales , it represents Evil and must be defeated by Făt-Frumos in order to release the princess . It is also believed , in Wallachia that the saliva of a balaur can form precious stones . [ 3 ]
The term Balaur ( Macedo-Romanian bul'ar ) is of unknown etymology . It has been linked with Albanian boljë ( `` snake '' ) buljar ( `` water snake '' ) , all terms possibly stemming from the same Thracian root , * bell- or * ber- `` beast , monster '' , the traces of which can also be found in the name of the Greek mythological hero Bellerophon ( `` the beast killer '' ) . The Transylvanian Saxon balaur `` dragon '' , and balaura , an insult term in Serbia , are borrowed from Romanian . [ 4 ] [ 5 ] The Serbo-Croatian blavor/blaor/blavur ( `` European legless lizard '' ) is cognate with balaur , and it is regarded as one of few pre-Slavic Balkan relict words in Serbo-Croatian . [ 5 ] The maniraptor theropod Balaur bondoc is named after this creature .
I have about as much interest in Elder Scrolls ' lore as I do in high definition photographs of infected hangnails . I 've been playing the series since the release of Daggerfall but I 've managed to absorb absolutely nothing about any ongoing plot or fantastic history . All that is about to change . The latest video promotion for The Elder Scrolls Online is hosted by ‘ Loremaster Lawrence Schick ' , who not only has an excellent job title and name , but also boasts superior facial foliage and a voice that is both wise and soothing . It is now one of my life 's ambitions to have Lawrence read The Silmarillion to me as a bedtime story .
“ Three young , muscular alliances…fertile heartland…Abnur Tharn 's Daedric connections ” – normally , anyone saying that last quoted part with a straight face would instantly lose my attention and respect , but when Mr Schick says it , I find myself leaning foward . Oh ho ! Do go on . Tell me more about these Daedric connections !
Christopher Ellis , 34 , is charged with two counts of possession of a controlled substance with intent to deliver .
HARRIS COUNTY , Texas - A deputy with the Harris County Sheriff 's Department is facing drug charges .
Christopher Ellis , 34 , is charged with two counts of possession of a controlled substance with intent to deliver .
Ellis is accused of stealing narcotics from drug dealers while on duty and then trying to sell those drugs for a profit , according to authorities .
Authorities say the investigation started after information was received about Ellis ' action .
Officials say Ellis was arrested Monday during their patrol shift . It happened near Beltway 8 and Highway 249 after Ellis allegedly sold cocaine , marijuana , Lorcet tablets and Soma tablets for $ 1,000 to an undercover officer .
`` Our mission of transparency and accountability for the purpose of maintaining the public 's trust requires constant vigilance , '' Harris County Chief Deputy Armando Tello said . `` Of the approximately 4,500 men and women in service to the Harris County Sheriff 's Office , the overwhelming majority follow the strict standards and policies enforced by Sheriff Garcia . ''
Ellis has been employed at the Sheriff 's Office since March 2010 . They have been placed on indefinite suspension . They could be sentenced to life in prison and be forced to pay a $ 10,000 fine if convicted .
Ellis is being held on two bonds that total $ 120,000 . The investigation remains ongoing .
`` Officers who violate the public trust by doing criminal acts will not be tolerated and Christopher Ellis will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law . '' District Attorney Devon Anderson said , `` I commend the Harris County Sheriff 's Office for promptly contacting us and working diligently to bring Deputy Ellis to justice . ''
Authorities said that they believe there are drug dealers who have been victimized by Ellis and encourages anyone with information to call the Internal Affairs Division of the Harris County Sheriff 's Office at 713-755-6517 .

Preface !
I 'm going to start taking this blog for real now with weekly updates and all . Therefore , I need to develop a structure but since this will be my first real article , I 'm going to be working out the formatting . If you do n't like it in any way please make suggestions , I 'm receptive ! And with that out of the way , let 's get into it .
Analysis , Teambuilding and FAQ
Reincarnated Kushinada-hime
Introducing the girl that single-handedly decided whether or not I 'll get D.Athena ! I am not getting D.Athena ( on NA ) after debating it for months – since their release in JP actually . Kushinadahime has everything I was looking for in D.Athena because my other team is Ra=Dragon . Please , get D.Athena if you feel you need them but Kushinadahime just fixes all problems from my Ra=Dragon team , including the ability to clear floors without stalling for orbs .
Now , I 'm only going to go over the key pro and con of Kushinada . For a great guide to use alongside my “ analysis ” , please check out Setsu 's blog here : ( SetsuPAD Kushinada Article )
Nez 's guide is absolutely wonderful so there 's no point in me going over the same material . Anyway , on with the guide .
Pro :
Them most defining feature setting them apart from Ra=Dragon and Dark Athena is complete damage control . While it takes some time to master , learning how to manipulate damage is the biggest reason to play Kushinadahime over Ra=Dragon .
Con :
There are many small negatives to Kushinadahime and no real glaring weakness . No RCV multiplier is covered by the team comprised entirely of healers and the RCV+35 % badge . Them restrictive sub-pool is not that hard to build around with Inheritance being a thing . If I had to name one specific thing then I believe Kushinadahime 's biggest flaw is their lack of damage . Yes , Haku is amazing and has plenty of damage . Without their though , unless you are capable of averaging 8-9 combo , it will be a bit difficult to one-shot everything . Haku specifically is very strong and not particularly reflective of the strengths of the team . After all , Kushinadahime is a very strong leader even without owning a single Haku but I digress , let 's get into the rest of the analysis .
Valkyries/ Guard Break : Is it worth it ?
I 've seen some posts on reddit questioning the idea of using 3x Haku and 1x Valkyrie Reine to activate Guard Break on Reine . This is my two cents .
Short Answer : Yes .
Long Answer : If you can build your team around Guard Break without not butchering your composition then it is absolutely worth it . Understand that Kushinadahime has unreliable damage without using an active . It will be fairly rare that you do n't have to use a skill just to kill Predra and Tans in Arena 2 or 3 and saving that one active is incredibly valuable in a long dungeon like Arena 2 or 3 . In other words , losing 170~ weighted stats for Guard Break is “ worth it ” . I put this in quotes because I assume for argument 's sake it 's a debate between Reine or Haku # 4 .
People do love to point out the inconsistency of having all five colours on-board but that is irrelevant because I 'm saying the “ possible ” upside of Guard Break vastly outweighs the loss of 130~ Weighted stats . After all , you do not need a 4th Haku anyways for the damage . You do more than enough with 2 .
Personally , I use Valkyrie Claire because I do n't have a full team of Haku anyways . ( Though I do have 4 Hakus on NA ) . I use Yuna to cover LIGHT because I do not have enough time extends on the rest of the team to average 8-combo otherwise .
And those 4 Hakus on NA ? I 'll be only use 2 .
Do I have to build the team DARK ? ( a.k.a . Haku , Haku , Haku . )
To answer this question , you first have to fully understand the hype surrounding Haku and then look at the rest of your box .
Haku is really strong and focusing your damage in dark is not going to be a bad idea if you 've got a few . If you do not own Haku , you can still build your team dark . Likewise if you own Haku , you do n't have to build the team dark . Honestly , it is entirely dependent on your box , as with all leads .
Haku absolutely makes our girl amazing . Between those weighted stats , double TPA and 7-C , Haku is undoubtedly a top contender for best sub in the game right now but this article is n't about Haku ; and Haku is not the end-all-be-all of Kushinadahime 's team . If you have one , put it on the team . If you have four , sure put them all of them team if you 'd like because she 's just that strong . However , there are other subs to go over and I will be making mention of in my opinion , the best ones .
Why :
If you do n't have DARK healers , do n't force DARK . Healers in DARK are rare . Farmable subs are n't all too impressive outside of Aamir who you 're not in need of because your leads are unbindable anyways and carry Recover Bind awakening . Haku 's active is good in FIRE/WATER based teams too . Particularly WATER because Kushi themselves will be dealing some form of damage . Haku fits easily into all teams . Haku covers two colours that Kushi themselves does n't have , easily satisfying anyone 's Guard Break , be it Valkyries or Princess Allura . Once again , I will remind people that Guard Break is n't necessary . It 's just a nice tool to have when it 's not too hard to include into your team . Furthermore , 9-turn cooldown is not the worst to inherit over .
Teambuilding : Pick a Colour , Any Colour
FIRE ATTRIBUTE :
At first I figured FIRE would not have a very good team . FIRE and WOOD are not really friends with each other , their synergy is weak outside of Leilan who is not a healer for Kushinadahime . Well , as it turns out , there 's a particular FIRE healer that a large part of the NA community has bought and has lying around . Hello Xiang Mei . With the eventual release of Awoken Uriel , and Valkyrie Femme already providing access to 7C awakening ( icon ) , the team seems pretty solid . Things to note :
Playing FIRE necessitates access to Fujin ( you or friend 's ) because Vishnu and Parvati will be a nightmare in Ultimate Arena . This is particularly the case if you have Xiang Mei 's Attacker-Killer awakening activated .
HP is on the lower side because Uriel and Xiang Mei lacks HP . By “ on the lower side ” I 'm talking about 50~60k HP so it 's not actually that low . Just low by Kushinadahime 's standards .
Xiang Mei 's insane RCV stat comes into incredible use .
I do not suggest buying Xiang Mei to play Kushinada but if you have them already , it seems very good on paper .

WATER ATTRIBUTE :
WATER 's greatest weakness : lack of access to 7C awakening with Valkyrie Reine being the only healer with it . That being said , there are enough strong TPA and healer subs to not completely disregard a WATER Kushinadahime team . I have seen it over 3-player Co-op and it does not seem terrible . My only regret is that Gabriel 's Awoken form is not a healer . In my opinion , the WATER Kushinadahime team rides on the back on Reincarnated Sun Quan . Things to note :
Double Sarasvati ( even though they are Row subs ) can create a steady stream of WATER orbs .
Apex Blue Flower Dragon , Starling provides a strong farmable TPA healer sub that creates both WOOD and WATER orbs .
Unfortunately , many healers in WATER are naturally Row-based subs
A mix of Orb Enhance and TPA awakenings may provide the best results for damage .

WOOD ATTRIBUTE :
I think the strongest feature in WOOD is the power of the subs possible in a fully unbindable team . That being said , these “ strongest ” subs are incredibly rare and highly sought after . I 'm looking at G.Kali , Valkyrie Elize and School Girl Athena .
Without these , the team is still strong but you have less breathing room to make an “ OP ” team . WOOD has access to some decent farmable options like Ras and Kaguyahime but not using them would be preferable . My main problem with playing WOOD is similar to WATER 's problem in that many subs are tuned to be Row subs ( read : Astaroth 's friends ) .
Astaroth and Michael are both good but they 're Row subs . I 'll cross my fingers that Michael remains a healer with their Awoken form but following the pattern of Gabriel , they will likely be an attacker .
A Dupe Kushinada is pretty good actually . You can keep them in Awoken if you need the LIGHT sub-attribute for Valkyrie Elize or Reincarnate them for 40 more weighted stats and 1 more Time Extend .
WOOD also lacks access to 7C unfortunately . Personally I run a half-WOOD , half-DARK team with my 1 Haku .

LIGHT ATTRIBUTE :
Something good came out of our dear NA-exclusive collaboration , Voltron . Princess Allura gives LIGHT access to an incredibly strong 7C sub with Guard Break akin to the coloured Valkyries . In that sense , you could call them the real L.Valk . Beside them is the 6-star only Diao Chan who also has 7C and covers DARK easily for the Guard Break awakening .
Healers are LIGHT 's territory so there is an abundance of good subs , especially in the Reincarnated category .
Without Allura , the other Guard Break option is Chibi valkyrie rose and she 's not bad because LIGHT teams probably will be playing TPA .
Valkyrie Ana , Elia and Sandalphon make for some strong farmable options
LIGHT and WOOD are strong allies , with many board changers covering both their colours .
Guard Break easily achievable with 2 subs or by putting Haku on the team to cover DARK/FIRE .

Excellent subs in Haku 's shadow – DARK ATTRIBUTE
Alright , so we all know Haku is the star of the show here but what about their friends ? Well if you do a quick search , you 'll quickly realize that there is a very limited sub-pool for DARK healers but they 're mostly good so I will go over them anyway .
Beside Haku , there are 2 rarer but very viable ( and arguably better in some contexts ) 7C healers in Valkyrie Claire and Asmodeus Another
You will be looking for inherits in different colours ( because Mitsunari Ishida is a much easier to obtain Armoured Batman ) . Not a big deal , just something to point out .

Sample Teams
Some people prefer to learn by example so here are some example teams I have considered .
FIRE – Colosseum :
Main team –
Inherits –
Explanation : You 'll need the gravity in Colosseum and helps in an assortment of ways including the Time Extend to make some perfect boards . The burst from Arcline is much more necessary in Colosseum and A3 than A1/2 so you can put another Orb/Board changer on Xiang Mei on that case . Also , playing a DARK sub ( yes , like Haku ) gives access to Guard Break . Maybe replacing Coloring Book , Sakuya so that inheriting Reincarnated Hades gives Haku a much appreciated stats buff .
WATER – Arena 3 :
Main team –
Inherits –
Explanation : Not much to say except that it 's a WATER-based TPA team as I had implied would be good in the WATER-Attribute section .
WOOD/DARK Hybrid – Arena 3 ( my team ) :
My team –
Inherits –
I have 9 Time Extends to make Sheen 's damage worthwhile , though it could easily be Arcline too . The matchup against Hephaestus Dragon is fairly unfavourable but the other 4 dragons are pretty straightforward with some good comboing . Fujin is only necessary for HeraDra since there is little problem with Sopdet and Parvati ( 5 combo ) . Vishnu might be a little tough with bad boards so you might have to Fujin there . Michael 's active is used to heal quite often despite taking away DARK orbs .
Individual Card Discussion :
I suppose yes , they are fine subs . My first instinct was “ they do n't provide very much ! ” but maybe that 's a bit harsh . I mean , some others on here are far more questionable . So are they good ? Yes , they provide a quick board change with shorter CD than Haku quick is even better if you 're inheriting over it . I did n't think very highly of the ability to create boards that let you activate Guard Break . I still believe that Famiel , Lumiel and Yang GuFei actives are far better but as bases these are fine . Not my cup of tea but if you 're building LIGHT or WATER Kushinada teams , go ahead !

Ask yourself these questions . They may not be hypothetical anymore . According to a newly leaked report from Edward Snowden , the National Security Agency ( NSA ) has , or once had , an extensive program called TURBINE , which used an automated system to pose as Facebook , so that it could implant malware on your computer and watch your every move . The story was first reported by the Intercept .
The NSA reportedly used a `` man-on-the-side '' attack to target and infect `` millions '' of computers . The agency would pretend to be Facebook and trick unsuspecting users ' computers into thinking they were connecting to Facebook 's servers . Then , the NSA would hack into your hard drive and steal your personal data .
The TURBINE program also used spam emails to infect computers will malware . The malware installed by the NSA could then gain access to the users ' microphone to record conversations , webcams to take photos , record browser history , save passwords and logins , corrupt downloaded files , and take data from flash drives that users plugged into their computers .
Although the program started in 2004 , it began to pick up steam over the next few years as the NSA hired more hackers to install new types of malware . Back in 2004 , the NSA limited itself to 100 to 150 `` implants , '' which were specifically targeted at individuals the agency believed to be threats to national security . At first , the malware was sent manually with actual people overseeing the process .
However , by 2010 , the NSA no longer cared about hitting specific targets with malware . The agency allowed an automated bot to act without oversight and target users indiscriminately , whether they were criminals or not . Once the bot had taken over the process , the program quickly escalated to include as many as 85,000 to 100,000 implants , according to estimates .
Facebook stated that the NSA can no longer pull this trick with its servers , but warned that other social networks may still be at risk from such attacks . The social network added that it had no knowledge of the program until now .
`` This method of network level disruption does not work for traffic carried over HTTPS , which Facebook finished integrating by default last year , '' Facebook told the National Journal . `` If government agencies indeed have privileged access to network service providers , any site running only HTTP could conceivably have its traffic misdirected . ''
It is unknown if the NSA is still using these techniques to infect computers , but chances are , TURBINE is still very active .

When I decide what to see in the theaters , I like to take into account what other reviewers have said about films currently in the theater . But while I like to take an informed approach , I obviously do have a “ gut feeling ” about movies , based on what I 've seen from trailers , the performers involved , writers , directors and previous films .
This article , and the ones which will follow as part of a periodic new feature on this site , will explain the “ Gut Feeling ” I have pertaining to the various movies hitting theaters that weekend .
Here goes nothing… feedback appreciated !
The Internship
Because I loved WEDDING CRASHERS , I 'd bet that I 'll really like The Internship… though I do n't expect it to be as good as their previous endeavor . Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn are both very entertaining , and together they 're worth more than the sum of their parts . I fully expect this to be better than HALL PASS and THE BREAK-UP .
The Purge
There 's no chance I 'm seeing this , and I do n't expect much from it . The premise is absurd , even if they found some way to make it the least bit plausible that the government would allow for a 12-hour period where criminal offenses are non-punishable .
Much Ado About Nothing
I 'm highly anticipating this film . Joss Whedon is great at interpersonal relationships on screen , and I 'm certain they did a great job translating this Shakespearian work into a very relateable flick . I do n't expect much from the box office on this one , and I do n't think that the public en masse is going to love it . I 'm far and away not a Shakespeare snob , nor would I guess I 've read more than a half-dozen of their works ( I have n't counted ) , and I do n't predict you have to have much of a history with enjoying The Bard 's work to appreciate what Whedon did here .
Wish You Were Here
I really like Joel Edgerton 's work , and I 've enjoyed what I 've seen from the talented Teresa Palmer . The plot to this one looks to be something which should make for a good flick : “ Four friends lose themselves in a carefree South-East Asian holiday . Only three come back . Dave and Alice return home to their young family desperate for answers about Jeremy 's mysterious disappearance. ” This will likely be one of those movies which people point to as an example of the skills Palmer and Edgerton can put on display , though wo n't probably make much money . I 'll get around to seeing it , though probably not until I can see it at home .
As Cool As I Am
Claire Danes and James Marsden . Both talented , but neither make me jump to go see a film . That said , this should be an entertaining flick . It 's listed as a comedy , and has a decent premise : “ A smart teenage girl comes of age in a small town with their self-centered parents who had them when they were teenagers “ . I will absolutely be looking for it on video , but not until after I see WISH YOU WERE HERE .
Violet & Daisy
A 2011 flick which is just now hitting theaters ? With this premise , I 'm glad it 's being described ( at least partially ) as a comedy . “ Two teenage assassins accept what they think will be a quick-and-easy job , until an unexpected target throws them off their plan. ” Could be good… but I 'm not expecting anything great . It was written by the guy who did the screenplay for PRECIOUS , so the writing could help the project pull through into something entertaining . This is ( writer ) Geoffrey Fletcher 's directorial debut , so that weighs into my expectations . I 'll be looking forward to the reviews .
Syrup
I 've seen good things from Amber Heard , and I 've seen average things from them With a supporting cast of Kellan Lutz , Brittany Snow and Rachel Dratch , I 'm not expecting much , though I will say that there have been movies like this before which end up being far more entertaining and of higher quality than previously expected . The writer , Max Barry , is a first-timer who already has another project in the works , so I 'm guessing someone saw the quality in the script ( adapted from Barry 's own novel ) .

Thin privilege is never having to hear the phrases “ You 're cute for a bigger girl ” or “ You 'll look even better once you lose some weight ” or my personal favorite “ Well , at least you have your personality . Its never having to hear your doctor say `` Why do n't you ask for Weight Watchers for Christmas this year ? ” . Thin privelege never makes you question if you 'd look funny beside your crush because they 're not as big as you are . Its never feeling like you 'll never be good enough to be anyone 's wife one day . Thin privelege is not getting used because they heard that fat girls are easy . Thin privilege does n't make you wish a car would just come and hit you full force but make you take back that wish because you do n't want to burden anyone with having to pick up your dead weight . Thin privilege is not having to know that you did n't get put on the cheerleading squad because of your weight , no matter how good you were . Thin privelege is something I 've wished for my whole life .
To see the world through the eyes of a 40-ton polar whale it helps to use a little bug . At least that 's what this satellite tracking tag resembles .
We 're crammed into an inflatable black rubber zodiac on a blustery day in Antarctica 's Gerlache Strait , puttering toward a motionless humpback whale . A fist-sized camera with gangly grasshopper-like antennae and suction cup feet sits on a pole resting on scientist Ari Friedlaender 's shoulders . Towering icebergs and glacier-draped mountains rise around us . Penguins arc in and out of the frigid sea . Every few moments the humpback lets loose a loud exhalation that sounds like a wet snore .
As we inch to within 15 feet of the whale , Friedlaender drops the pole . They use it to gently slap the harmless satellite tag 's suction cups onto whale flesh . The startled animal shudders and dives . And it begins recording a whale's-eye view of a changing undersea universe , helping reshape our knowledge of whale life in the Southern Ocean .
This temporary satellite tag and video camera is one of only six or eight a year that scientists like Friedlaender are able to attach to humpbacks in the waters along the western side of the Antarctic Peninsula . The devices track cetacean movements and take video images of everything in front of the whale for 24 to 48 hours before falling off and floating free . Researchers then use GPS tracking to recover the tag before offloading its video .
`` There 's so much we do n't know about these animals , '' says Friedlaender , a National Geographic explorer and ecologist with Oregon State University 's Marine Mammal Institute . `` But now we 're getting to see so much awesome stuff—feeding behavior , deep dives , social interactions . It 's just amazing . ''
This simple but time-consuming research method does more than just provide new data . It 's helping scientists piece together a picture of what a day in the life of a humpback is like as it swims along the icy bottom of the world . The research is supported by the World Wildlife Fund .
Sea of Change
Warming temperatures are changing Antarctica 's seas faster than most waters on Earth . There are now 80 more ice-free days a year on parts of the west side of the peninsula than there were when whaling ended in the 1960s . All that open water is helping humpback populations explode .
They are rising here by up to 10 percent per year , filling in waters once shared with tens of thousands of blue and fin whales , which have been slower to recover from decades of slaughter . This is happening even as ice-dependent minke whales struggle , and Adelie and chinstrap penguin numbers plummet at nearby colonies .
What allows humpbacks here to be so successful that new mothers can be pregnant again even while they 're still lactating and helping to feed newborn calves ?
Humpback ecology and behavior in places like California have been well-documented . But scientists have struggled in recent years to track how whales spend their time here after arriving in December and January from their equatorial homes near Panama and Colombia . Research in Antarctica is so hard and expensive that even Friedlaender travels with a cruise company , One Ocean Expeditions , where they give science lectures to tourists in exchange for access to company rafts that they can use to track down and tag whales .
Even so , with vast travel times and rough , unpredictable weather , it can be hard to get more than a handful of days of field work in on any given trip .
Yet Friedlaender 's cameras already reveal new dimensions to whale life in Antarctica .
Up Close : Humpback Surfacing in Marina
Surprising Finds
Scientists knew , for example , that these whales feast on great masses of shrimp-like krill in open water even as other creatures struggle to find enough krill near shore . But now they can track when humpbacks start to put on weight , see which foraging areas are most productive , and see what the environment around them is like .
`` If all we have is satellite tracking data and no camera then you do n't know if they 're feeding in ice , if they are around other whales , '' Friedlaender says . `` By linking where they are with where the krill and sea ice are relative to other predators we get a much better idea of the placement of these whales in this ecosystem . ''
They are uncovering surprises . They 've found the whales feeding in waters far deeper than expected . Footage shows them getting so much to eat that they have energy enough to roll and play with one another , a social strategy that helps whales learn how to cooperate and hunt together—and , presumably , get even more food .
They 've seen whales spending more time than anyone knew swimming under crumbly brash ice—the detritus of melting sea ice and glaciers . They even appear to be using their blow holes to create openings in the ice to rest or breathe .
`` It 's really beautiful when they are swimming under the sea ice , '' they say . `` They 're so fluid and moving around in three dimensions and just cruising . But to be honest , we do n't know what everything we 're watching means yet . ''
Kristin Laidre , a University of Washington polar scientist who studies humpbacks and other marine mammals in the Arctic , says that kind of video work is pretty much the only option in some parts of the world .
`` Being able to remotely track animal behavior and movements and how they use habitat is the only way we can make progress on understanding their lives in these polar environments , '' says Laidre , who mostly works in Greenland .
Sometimes , Friedlaender and their colleagues are able to also use drone cameras to get a simultaneous aerial and underwater view , allowing them to track behavior from multiple perspectives .
And sometimes they even catch glimpses of themselves , when tagged whales surface near where scientists are working .
`` One day , one of the tagged whales was mugging us , spy-hoping and rolling around underneath us , basically playing with us like we were a little toy for a couple of hours while it was videotaping , '' Friedlaender says . `` These are magical animals , fantastic and very curious . And it 's really cool to see yourself from their perspective , but it 's so startling that it 's a good reminder that we do n't really belong there . ''
MONTREAL - All three candidates vying for the Quebec Liberal leadership say they want the province to sign the Canadian Constitution , though not necessarily any time soon .
Philippe Couillard , a former health minister and the presumed front-runner , said Saturday it 's something Quebec must work toward .
`` It 's not a pressing issue , but it 's something we have to work on , '' Couillard said at an English-language leadership debate in Montreal .
`` I want Quebec to be a signatory on the Constitution of Canada . ''
Pierre Moreau and Raymond Bachand , both ex-ministers as well , also stressed it was an important issue . But Bachand said it was n't the time to reopen thorny constitutional talks , while Moreau said it does n't necessarily need to happen right away .
`` There 's a limited number of hours that a premier has , '' Bachand said .
Bachand , a former finance minister and the architect of the Liberals ' university tuition increases , said the priority should be the economy and determining how to fund social services , not the Constitution .
`` The day is not right for the debate in this country , '' they said .
The Liberals will select former premier Jean Charest 's successor in March .
Charest , who stepped down as Liberal leader after losing the provincial election to the Parti Quebecois last September , was reluctant to address the issue while in office .
As a member of Brian Mulroney 's cabinet , they had a front-row seat in the constitutional debates of the 1980s and 1990s .

Gen. Robert H. Barrow , USMC , once said that “ Amateurs talk about tactics , but professionals study logistics. ” That 's true in many enterprises , but in warfare , the side that neglects logistics is likely to be the loser . Keeping soldiers fed , clothed , and armed is the very essence of effectively prosecuting a war , and the long logistical chain from rear supply depots to forward action is what makes that possible .
Armies have had millennia to optimize logistics , and they have always maximized use of new technologies to position supplies where they 're needed . Strong backs of men and beasts sufficed for centuries , supplemented by trains in the 19th century and supplanted by motor vehicles in the 20th . Later , aircraft made an incalculable impact on supply chains , allowing rapid mobilization of supplies and supporting the industrial scale death and destruction of the 20th-century 's wars .
But no matter how supplies make it from the factories to supply depots within the theater of operations , eventually they have to get to front line units . That can pose huge problems , especially for units that are cut off from support by enemy action , or by Special Forces units deliberately operating within enemy territory . Keeping them in ammo and MREs can be a logistical nightmare .
It 's no surprise then to learn that the US Marine Corps is looking at drones as a way of keeping front line troops supplied . In this day of advanced , heavy-lift multi-copters and long-range semi-autonomous drones like the Predator or Global Hawk , you 'd figure such a program would have all the bells and whistles to deliver pork to some defense contractor . But it turns out that USMC 's Tactical Air Delivery ( TACAD ) is so simple it almost makes you wonder why nobody has done it before .
The TACAD drone is planned to be a glider that can carry up to 500 pounds of supplies . Dropped from a cargo plane orbiting at 35,000 feet safely behind the front lines , the 15:1 glide ratio allows it to cover perhaps 85 miles to its target , guided by GPS and controlled by regular hobby servos .
Here 's the kicker : it 's totally disposable . Built from plywood and designed for exactly one use , the glider simply flies to the landing zone and crash lands . One assumes there will be some kind of provision made for a “ controlled flight into terrain ” so that the supplies do n't have to be overpackaged or limited to only the most robust items , but even so , there 's no intention to reuse the drone .
One-time use is a huge benefit to TACAD over competing systems , like the US Army 's Joint Precision Airdrop System , which uses GPS-guided paragliders that are expensive enough to demand recovery by the forward units for eventual reuse . JPADS adds to the burden of the soldiers it supplies , since they have to hump the 30-pound units back out of the field , while TACAD demands nothing after its job is done and even provides materials that might prove useful to the soldiers .
Whether either of these systems is ever fielded remains to be seen . I 'd put money on at least one of them seeing action — the idea of quickly resupplying dug-in troops from stand-off distances is just too good to pass up for the professionals who ponder logistics for a living . The cynic in me says that like any military project , it 's likely to get larded up with unnecessary complications so the denizens of Congress can be seen as bringing the bacon back home to their districts . TACAD is an idea that derives its power from its simplicity , but even if it does get overcomplicated it 's another great use case for automated delivery .
SEATTLE — FBI Director James Comey says an agent impersonated an Associated Press reporter during a 2007 criminal investigation , a ruse the news organization says could undermine its credibility .
In a letter Thursday to The New York Times , Comey said the agent “ portrayed themselves as an employee of The Associated Press ” to help catch a 15-year-old suspect who had been making bomb threats at a high school near Olympia , Washington .
Comey said the agent posing as an AP reporter asked the suspect to review a fake AP article about threats . The suspect clicked on a link , revealing their computer 's location and Internet address , helping agents confirm their identity .
AP Executive Editor Kathleen Carroll says the FBI 's actions are “ unacceptable ” and “ undermine AP and the vital distinction between the government and the press . ”

I got six of these and had them shipped all the way to me here in Japan because I just could NOT find anything even close to this simple snow block maker . They came really quickly and , let me say , it was SO worth the price of the shipping . My Japanese friends just FLIPPED over these , they immediately started seeing images of their kids busy building snow / sand forts for hours while they finally got some way overdue P & Q , relaxing in the background sipping on their favorite drinks . And that is JUST what happened when one guy took their kids up to the ski resort last month . They said their two boys were so focused on that fort they could n't believe it . Said the plastic was lightweight yet sturdy , with little holes making it easy for them to slide the snow blocks out to make a wall . All my friends said they could n't WAIT till it was time to go to the beach , so they could get nice tans while letting the kids get at it . Until Japanese manufacturers get wise I 'll be getting some more of these to gift out . Great !
Is there a worthwhile discussion to be had about interracial dating and relationships ?
The answer seems to be no , if you 've paid any attention to posts written on the subject that have been blowing up my little patch of the Internet lately . Of course I 'm referring to “ I 'm An Asian Woman And I Refuse To Ever Date An Asian Man ” by Jenny An , and the clickbait-y response to An 's clickbait-y call , “ I Am An Asian Woman And I Think Asian Boyfriends Are Superior ( Well , Mine Is Anyway ) , ” by Clarissa Wei , both published on xojane , a site to which I 've contributed .
Simply put : I 'm An Asian Woman And I Think This Conversation Sucks .
First things first . I do n't give a fuck who these women fuck or , really , what any woman chooses to do with their own vagina . Because it 's their own vagina , get it ? And because it 's their own vagina , they do n't need to justify what they do with it . It should go without saying that a woman can do whatever they want with their own body . But when they feel the need to explain why they do what they do with it , which is what these posts boil down to for me , she 's just playing into this very old and very male idea that a woman needs to justify what they do with their own body because , ultimately , they do n't have authority over , I repeat , their own body . Sound familiar ? It should ( see : “ the war on women ” ) .
The other problem with these posts is that they put race and gender at odds with one another , like they have this mutually exclusive relationship , and you have to choose one or the other to have some kind of cohesive identity . If you believe An 's argument–which they later backpedaled on , calling it “ a character ” designed to provoke discussion–as an Asian woman , in order to reject “ patriarchy and cultural sexism , ” you have to be a racist dick and hate your people . And if you believe Wei 's argument , which asserts that Asian boyfriends are the best because they make “ a lot ” of money , shower their girlfriends with gifts , and point out when you 've gained weight…wait , what ? Pause for station identification :
“ He helps me keep fit . Being fat is not okay in a stereotypically Asian community . My boyfriend works out to stay fit and frequents the gym on a daily basis . And when I 'm packing on the pounds , they notice . ”
So , like I was saying , if you believe Wei 's argument , as an Asian woman , in order to love your people and not be a racist dick , you have to morph into some kind of pre-feminist , rich husband-chaser who 's totally okay with their man telling them what 's wrong with , I repeat , their own body . ( It should be noted that Wei , in the pictures accompanying their post , looks thin and quite improbable as someone who would “ pack on the pounds , ” which makes their argument even sadder . )
The idea that you have to be racist to throw off sexual oppression or sexist to throw off racial oppression–but that you ca n't fight both at the same time–is a very old and very stupid one propagated by–you guessed it ! –racists and sexists . As a wise woman of multiple identities once said , “ I simply do not believe that one aspect of myself can possibly profit from the oppression of my other part of my identity . ”
What concerns me the most at the end of the day is that these discussions about race and gender–happening on a women 's site , no less–are discussions initiated by women that are , nevertheless , discussions being had on other people 's terms . And using the language of men , racists , and sexists is no way for Asian women , women of color , or any women for that matter , to define themselves .

Spending the Fourth of July in New York City is one of those magical moments you 'll never forget . Watching the bright colors exploding over the Empire State Building and the brilliant NYC skyline is an image that is so beautiful that 50 years from now it will still be burned into your mind . Everyone in the world should get to experience it at least once in their lifetime .
One of the most common questions that tourists and residents alike have been asking is about a place to watch . Where should I watch the 4th of July fireworks from ? Well , we 've done the research for you , so here is our list of the best places to watch the Fourth of July firework show in New York City :
4 . Riverside Park
Macy 's has said that the barges that will shoot off the fireworks will be positioned from 18th street to 48th street on the Hudson River . This means that the further north you go , the less likely you are to get a good view . Riverside Park is definitely a downgrade from the block party that will be Twelfth Avenue , but if you can get a spot at the very south end of the park may be worth checking out . The NYC Parks Department will stop letting people in at 4 p.m. , so get there early .
3 . Twelfth Avenue
Twelfth Avenue and the northbound lanes of the West Side Highway between 22nd and 59th will be closed to traffic at 2 p.m. and open to pedestrians . Show up early and hang out with the crowd as you gear up for the big show over the Hudson , but do n't bring any backpacks , coolers or lawn chairs because police wo n't let you in .
2 . A Rooftop
Does your apartment building have rooftop access ? Do you have a friend that has rooftop access ? Enjoy the fireworks with an elevated view from the middle of Manhattan . Fill a cooler with some ice cold beer , grab some friends and enjoy the privacy of your rooftop for the show . Do n't worry about showing up early to get a good spot . Just relax and have fun .
While Twelfth Avenue will provide an up close view and your buddy 's roof could be a relaxing experience , nothing will be more fun or spectacular than a Fireworks Cruise on the East River . Watching the show aboard a boat from the East River will not only give you access to a bar and live music from a DJ , but it will also give you the best view . Not only do you get to see the fireworks , but you get to see them crack above the New York skyline . From anywhere in Manhattan , Jersey will be you backdrop , but aboard a special Fireworks Cruise , you get the best view in the world .

Their name is Norman Braman , and you can read about their financial relationship with Marco Rubio in the New York Times :
“ MIAMI — One day in the State Capitol in Tallahassee , Marco Rubio , the young speaker of the House , strayed from the legislative proceedings to single out a lanky , silver-haired man seated in the balcony : a billionaire auto dealer named Norman Braman . This man , Mr. Rubio said in effusive remarks in 2008 , was no ordinary billionaire , hoarding their cash or using it to pursue selfish passions . … ”
Note : As of late , the New York Times has been refreshingly honest about how Jewish billionaires like Sheldon Adelson and Norman Braman are pulling the strings of their Republican puppets like Lindsey Graham , Tom Cotton , and Marco Rubio . Scott Walker is flying to Israel right now to meet with their constituents .
In their still young tenure with the Chicago Fire , Veljko Paunovic has shown to be an optimist who at times even resembles a motivational speaker in the way they talk .
The coach frequently speaks about instilling specific values in players like hard work , belief in what the team is doing and creating a winning mentality . On Monday , two days after the Fire 's sixth straight road loss , Paunovic showed their optimistic side .
“ At some point we will surprise everyone with how well we played and how well we worked the game , ” Paunovic said in a conference call . “ We have to work for that moment and be consistent and wait for that to happen . But still , hard work , commitment , consistency and belief . ”
Paunovic has shown minor levels of frustration with the team 's mentality , but has also never spoken negatively about the team in a general sense yet this season . At least in what they say , Paunovic remains positive and committed to what them and general manager Nelson Rodriguez are building despite sitting in last place in the league .
As for Saturday 's performance , in which the Fire conceded an early goal and were outshot 25-11 , Paunovic said the team improved in the second half thanks to some adjustments and the introduction of Michael de Leeuw .
“ We switched formations and in the game came Michael de Leeuw who I think did very well , ” Paunovic said . “ He gave us some good attacking options and a very good dynamic . There are still some adjustments for him , not only adjustments for the demands of the league , but also for the team that this is the first game they played with their teammates . ”
De Leeuw managed one shot in 45 minutes of play in Toronto . Paunovic described de Leeuw as a dynamic attacker capable of switching positions in order to find space , but the Fire have a more specific role for them in the short-term .
“ At this point we see them playing at the top , as a reference , as a target , but given that he 's not that kind of player , ” Paunovic said . “ We will look to take advantage of their dynamic and attacking movement in order to create superiority in any part of the field in attack . ”
That positional flexibility could come in handy soon though . Wednesday 's game against Sporting Kansas City will be the Fire 's second game out of five in a 15-day span . Paunovic said there will be some squad rotation given the crowded schedule , which was also another reason why Matt Polster was left off the bench in Toronto .
“ He was cleared last week , ” Paunovic said of Polster . “ We wanted to give them more time to prepare for the stretch that we have now in front and be of course available 100 percent . We will count on them for the next games that we have . ”
Some Android apps thought to be vulnerable to the Heartbleed bug were spared because of a common coding error in the way they implemented their own native OpenSSL library .
FireEye scanned 54,000 Android applications in Google 's Play store on April 10 to see which ones are vulnerable to Heartbleed . The flaw , publicly disclosed on April 7 , is contained in OpenSSL , a code library used to encrypt data traffic .

The security company found several games and office-based mobile applications that are vulnerable to the bug , mostly because the applications use their own native OpenSSL library rather than the one in the Android OS . Google said Android was mostly immune to Heartbleed .
`` We have notified some of the app developers , '' wrote researchers Yulong Zhang , Hui Xue and Tao Wei on FireEye 's blog .
The Heartbleed flaw is buffer overflow vulnerability in which a server returns too much information , divulging user credentials and sensitive data such as the private key for an SSL certificate .
But it can also be used to attack applications . FireEye said attacking a game could yield its OAuth token , an authentication token , which could be used to hijack an account or linked social networking accounts .
At first glance , some Android office productivity applications also appeared to be vulnerable . But the researchers found a common coding mistake actually meant the Heartbleed bug would n't work .
`` A deeper look shows that these apps either make a mistake in the native code linkage or just contain dead code , '' wrote the FireEye researchers .
`` Therefore , when they try to invoke SSL functions , they directly use the non-vulnerable OpenSSL library contained within the Android OS , instead of using the vulnerable library provided by the app . ''
FireEye also found upwards of 17 applications on Google Play claiming to detect the Heartbleed vulnerability . Only six scanned applications on an Android device . Of those six , two missed applications confirmed as vulnerable .
Others in the batch of 17 performed questionable scans and appeared to be designed to deliver advertising software .

The Nutritional Facts
As a certified personal trainer and nutritionist for many years , I spent a lot of time teaching the importance of reading the Nutritional Facts on food products . It not only tells you exactly what ingredients make up that food product , but it gives the percentage of each . I was often surprised at how many clients of mine never paid any attention to the food label , nor understand how to read it . Almost all of them just went by what was written on the front of the packaging . I always stressed to my clients the importance of reading the nutritional facts because some companies will cheat and name their products in a deceiving manner . Just because a food product says the word healthy , does n't necessarily tell you anything about what 's in it .
Now almost two years into my photography business , I 've started receiving more and more emails and Facebook messages regarding advice on starting a successful business . With society pushing photography as a means of documenting and sharing the happenings in our lives , it 's easy to see why . The popularity of photography has sky rocketed over the past few years . We no longer need to spend a lot of money for a decent digital camera , our smart phones are now just as capable as nice point and shoots were 5 years ago . Even DSLRs have come down in price drastically compared to what they were , making the transition to a more professional camera a possibility without breaking the bank . You no longer have to have an expensive fancy camera to take nice photos . You actually do n't need to know anything about photography at all , the camera can take care of all of the technical stuff for you .
The Misconception
Along with it 's growing popularity , the idea of being a professional or starting a business in photography has grown as well . It seems that anyone with a little artistic talent and a nice app for adding filters can grow a nice following of fans , and be considered a photographer . Upgrading to a DSLR with a decent lens may even make you feel like a professional photographer . But , what does it take to be a professional photographer ? How hard can it be to run a photography business ? What would be better than getting paid to take photos for people ? Easy enough right ? Sure .
Well , as good as that sounds , it takes me back to my personal training and nutritionist days . It reminds me of when clients would not realize the difficulty and complexity of following a strict diet and what it took to be successful at reaching your goals . I would have to stress the importance of food labels and understanding how to read the nutritional facts for a reason . It 's not always obvious what your putting in your body . Just like with food products that claim to be healthy by name , taking a deeper look at the ingredients of a successful photography business might surprise you . Just like with diets , most photography businesses fail . It 's a fact , and I truly believe that it 's because most photographers do n't really know what goes into being successful .
During a recent shoot , I was reminded how big of a misconception there is to what it takes to run a successful photography business . I was told that I have the coolest job in the world and how awesome it must be to get paid to take pictures . While I do have to agree that I have one of the coolest jobs in the world , it 's not my only one . I politely explained that I still have a full time job as an engineer , my weekends are no longer days off , and I spend on average 15-20 hours a week at my computer editing after working 8 hours . The actual photography part of my photography business is very little when compared to everything else that it takes to make my business successful .
The Reality
What does it take to be a professional photographer or own a successful photography business ? What are the key ingredients ? Well I ca n't speak for every single success story out there , but surprisingly photography is usually not the main ingredient . This is why I usually like to stress one important thing to those asking me the question . Starting a business and trying to become a professional photographer may sound great , but in order to be successful at it , you need to be willing to put the camera down . Being a good photographer is a very small ingredient of being successful . I have seen great photographers fail miserably , and average photographers be extremely successful . You need be good at business , marketing yourself , editing , and have good social skills among many other things .
I wanted to get an idea of how I spend my time on an average month , to better answer the question of what ingredients make up a successful photography business . For the past 4 weeks I kept track of how I spent every hour of every day . I took the 672 hours in that 4-week period and subtracted it by the hours that I slept , which left me with 476 hours of time that I was awake . 7 hours of sleep was the average , so there were a lot of late nights trying to make deadlines when I had to be up early for work the next day . Here is how it came out , and what the nutritional facts of my photography business look .
Conclusion
If you enjoy photography and taking photos , especially if you are talented at it , the idea of turning it into a business may have crossed your mind . If it has n't already , it promises you that it will . I was raised by a wedding photographer mother and was introduced to a camera long before I can remember . Photography is n't new to me , but it was n't until two years ago that I decided to turn it into a business . I had a good idea as to what it would take to be successful , and I knew that being a good photographer was just a small part of that . Obviously photography is my passion , but I also love the business part of it , which is a huge factor to my success .
Making money doing something that you love is the American dream , but you need to know what it takes to make that dream come true . Most of the time it 's not what you think , and taking a deeper look at the ingredients may change your mind . I thought that some of you out there might find this interesting . Whether you already own a business or looking to start one , it gives you a better idea as to what the bag labeled ‘ photography business ' actually has in it .
The military 's earthquake relief operations in Gujarat , Kashmir and Sikkim , and rescue work during the Ladakh flash floods highlight that it is the only effective disaster response force in the country , says Ajai Shukla
The Indian Air Force has imaginatively employed its new C-130J Super Hercules aircraft -- six of which were purchased in 2010 from the United States for Rs 3,835 crore -- to revive flagging rescue and relief efforts at Dharasu , in flood-hit Uttarakhand .
With fuel running out for the Indian Air Force 's Mi-17 helicopters that were flying relief missions from the small , 1,300-metre Dharasu airstrip , the C-130Js ' game-changing ability to land on tiny airstrips was brought into play . Fully fuelled C-130Js flew in from Hindon ( near Ghaziabad ) and landed in Dharasu , each one unloading 8,000 litres of aviation fuel from its on-board tanks for use by the Mi-17s . On their return journey , the C-130Js ferried medically distressed people , making this a two-way air bridge .
This is just one recent example of military equipment and personnel becoming the instrument of last resort for overwhelmed administrators in disaster situations .
The Gujarat earthquake in 2001 ; the Kashmir earthquake in 2005 ; the Ladakh flash floods in 2010 ; the Sikkim earthquake in 2011 ; and multiple flood relief operations highlight that the military is the only effective disaster response force in the country . And that the vast sums spent on the military and its equipment are not just insurance for some far-fetched threat of external aggression but real capability for situations that all too frequently move beyond the capacity of the other instruments of state .

Image caption The couple worked to defend the Amazon rainforest
A prominent Brazilian conservationist and their wife have been killed in the Amazon region , police have said .
They said Joao Claudio Ribeiro da Silva and Maria do EspIrito Santo da Silva were ambushed in Para state , near the city of Maraba .
The environmentalist had repeatedly warned of death threats against them by loggers and cattle ranchers .
News of the killings came hours before Brazil 's Chamber of Deputies passed a law that eases deforestation rules .
The government has ordered an immediate investigation and promised to catch those responsible for the deaths of Mr Da Silva and their wife .
The bodies of the couple were found inside the nature reserve , Praialta-Piranheira , where they had been working for the past 24 years .
According to family and friends , the pair had been subjected to numerous threats in the past two years for their environmental activism .
They made a living with eco-friendly cultivation of nuts , fruit and rubber .
Environmental amnesty
News of the deaths came just hours before Brazil 's Chamber of Deputies voted on changes to the existing Forest Code .
The legislation , first enacted in 1934 and subsequently amended in 1965 , sets out how many trees farmers can cut down .
Regulations currently require that 80 % of a landholding in the Amazon remain forest , 20 % in other areas .
The new bill , which now needs approval from the Senate and President Dilma Rousseff , reduces the amount of land farmers must keep as forest .
Other changes include some amnesties for those who have illegally cleared land in the past .
Proponents of change argued that the law impeded economic development and said that Brazil had to open more land for agriculture .
Opponents described the legislation as a `` disaster '' .
`` It heightens the risk of deforestation , water depletion and erosion , '' Paulo Gustavo Prado from Conservation International-Brazil told Reuters .
If you are tired of creating shopping lists the old fashion way with pen and paper , there is a relatively new Windows Phone app available the hopes to turn your head . We were tipped on Cart Nav and while I have to admit that I 'm still one to grab a scrap piece of paper to create shopping lists , I was curious if Cart Nav was appealing enough to change my ways . Cart Nav has support for multiple lists for specific stores and the layout is n't too cumbersome to navigate around . It does allow you to sort your items into categories and will let you price items and chart the cost history . You also have Cortana integration so you can add items by voice commands . Cart Nav definitely has potential , especially if the developer is successful at adding one of the planned features .
When you first launch Cart Nav , you will need to create a list by tapping the + button that sits at the bottom of the main screen . You will then get to choose one of the preset stores , add a store , delete a store and edit the store listing layout .
The preset stores include Walmart , Publix , Kroger , Albertsons , Safeway , Target and Shoprite . The stores are also divided into mapped and unmapped categories . A mapped store already has the categories or sections of the store organized ( produce , dairy , deli , drinks , etc. ) . I 'm not sure why there is the distinction because you can always edit the layout to fit your needs . I like the category mapping in that if you know you roam a store in a particular order , your list can display the items based on that order . It lessens the chances of you forgetting to pick up crackers when you 've made it all the way to the other side of the store .
To edit a store , which includes deleting it from the list , tap and hold on the store listing and the button menu at the bottom of the screen will change from the + button to an edit and delete buttons . I was expecting a drop down menu to appear and if you are n't looking for the control button change you may miss it and get a little frustrated because you can not delete a store . Nonetheless , once you have added your store to the main page it is time to create a shopping list . Tap on the store tile and you will be sent to the list creation screen where you can start adding items by tapping the + button . Cart Nav has a large volume of pre-categorized items . Should you enter an item not recognized by Cart Nav it will be placed in the other category . Once added to the list , you can tap on any listed item to edit the quantity , price , units and category of an item as the need arises . Once you have established a purchase history on items , you can view a charted cost history from the edit screen for that item .
This just popped-up in the comments section , from Magpul Industries founder and CEO Richard Fitzpatrick :
This is a more complete statement ..
With our distribution model , it would be difficult to enforce such a blanket policy , and would be a symbolic gesture . Just as it is difficult to stop $ 50 and $ 100 PMAGs at the retail level from resellers that buy through multiple levels of distribution , stopping sales to specific end-users would be almost impossible for the same reasons . . .
On the other side of this , we have seen the efforts of the Larimer County Sheriff and others in the CO Sheriffs ' Association , who have been incredible advocates for the Second Amendment here in the fight we are currently in . If a ban passes , these guys would be the ones hurt , and the politicians would n't care . They would also be on our side . On the same front , about 600 of the NYSP have come out in protest of the NY SAFE act and in support of responsible Citizens and the 2A , at the risk of losing their jobs , their retirement , and the safety of their families . Are these the guys that we want to punish ? Lumping all individual officers together and wanting to punish them all is no different than politicians who want to punish responsible Citizens for the behavior of criminals . Would a check box on the LE/MIL order form affirming 2A support for all Citizens make a difference ? How many out there click on “ I Accept ” for terms and agreements before an iOS update without reading or caring what they are ? Would anyone NOT click such a box ? Chuck Schumer would even click that box if they were trying to order PMAGs . ( We would n't ship that one . )
If these LEOs who support our cause , and are “ gun guys ” find employment elsewhere because they ca n't get the right gear to perform their jobs safely , or if politicians fire them for voicing their objections , they will simply be replaced with new faces that are n't gun guys , do n't know any better , and may gladly stomp on your rights without a second thought if given the order . As it stands now , these pro-gun LEOs in occupied or potentially occupied territory are the only voices of reason among the LEO ranks there . Do we really want to purge them out and replace them with guys that would n't know the difference between an AR and a Hi-point , and so could n't care less which one they are armed with , and that will also blindly follow anti-2A directives without objection ? If you think that politicians will be affected by LE or MIL having less effective tools to do their jobs , you would be mistaken . I enlisted in the USMC during the Clinton years . I know better . If something did get ugly , I 'm pretty sure I know who 's side CO Sheriffs will be on . Some folks take their oaths seriously .
Regardless of political views , these guys face violent criminals , make 2 am traffic stops , serve felony warrants , raid meth labs , etc . We refuse to punish LE collectively for the anti-2A beliefs of some , or even of their politically appointed chiefs , who could care less about properly equipped officers in many cases . We see this as no different than demanding that legislators do not punish all society for the actions of criminals by taking away rights from the law abiding .
Because of this , we wo n't bend from our principles , and if anyone decides they need to not buy our products based on this stance , then we are fine with you not bending on yours . If you 're selling any of your Colts over this , I might be interested .
Although we absolutely support the goals of the companies willing to stand up in this effort , we do n't believe a policy like this is the best way to achieve those goals for us . Right now , we are engaged in the fight of our lives for 2A rights here in CO . Despite the high costs that moving would entail , we would actually be better off financially if we had just moved , rather than staying in the fight , based on the time , effort , and resources that we have poured into this battle , and are still pouring in . Simply running away would n't be our style , though , and would be a betrayal of our friends , neighbors , the free Citizens of CO , and would concede a defeat for gun rights across the country . So , we are fighting . We are in this fight on both the state and national levels . Do any of us really want to uproot our families , leave our homes , and head out of the state ? Hell no . But we will .
For those of you who want to call it a corporate greed business decision , or that we are following a monetary necessity , we had every opportunity to cave and probably could have written whatever exemption language we wanted if we had backed off and sold out CO Citizens to completely protect our ability to manufacture . They probably would have cut all kinds of deals to get us to back out and not make the jobs and economy part of the issue , and we did n't . They came to us prior to the vote on the day the exemption was presented on the floor and asked , basically , “ Are we cool now ? ” To which , we responded NO , and that NO exemption or condition would keep us here , and that we did n't support that amendment , let alone the bill . We are standing by our principles , and if yours differ , that 's fine , and we encourage you to stand by them , whatever they are .
For right now , we feel that efforts towards this end on our part would be more effective by looking at agency sales on a case-by-case basis behind the scenes rather than with a blanket policy shouted from the rooftops that punishes individual officers , and that our efforts are best directed where we are using them currently . We encourage others , whether friends or competitors , to do what they think is best , also , even if it differs from our position . This may evolve , but for right now , that is where we are at , and while we are always open to listening to reason , no boycotts or flaming will change our minds from doing what we feel is the right thing to do .
CLOSE People are n't the only ones gaining extra pounds . Angeli Kakade ( @ angelikakade ) has the scoop . Buzz60
A few extra pounds can make pets uncomfortable and cause a slew of health issues . ( Photo11 : cynoclub , Getty Images/iStockphoto )
It 's no secret that Americans waistlines have been expanding for years , and a new report shows our pets are following suit .
Banfield Pet Hospital 's 2017 State of Pet Health report found that one in three pets who visited Banfield pet facilities in 2016 was overweight or obese . The annual report details health habits of the 2.5 million dogs and 500,000 cats who visited facilities across the country in 2016 .
Dr. Kirk Breuninger , a veterinary research associate at Banfield Pet Hospital , said they noticed a trend in pets gaining weight five years ago .
`` More than 20 disease conditions have been linked with pets being overweight , '' Breuninger said . `` While some may say , 'My pet looks cute being pudgy or plump , ' ultimately carrying those extra pounds contributes to exasperating these diseases . ''
Breuninger said a healthy weight could prolong a pet 's life and delay chronic disease . They note that the report found that the prevalence of overweight pets coincided with an uptick in arthritis and tracheal collapse in dogs .
And overweight pets are n't easy on pet owners ' wallets .
The report found that over a four-year period , owners of overweight dogs spend 17 % more in healthcare costs vs. owners of healthy dogs , and owners of overweight cats spend 36 % more in diagnostic procedures versus owners of healthy weight cats .
They said a cocktail of factors could play a part in pets gaining a few extra pounds .
`` We know a few things that are really linked with pets becoming overweight , one of which is pets not getting enough exercise , pets eating too much food , and pet owners who really consider pets a part of the family use treats as a form of communication with pets , '' they said .
They said it 's also possible that other issues are a play , like thyroid problems or even intestinal worms .
More coverage :
Breuninger suggests people consult with their vet about whether their pet is the ideal weight and develop a plan for shedding a few pounds or maintaining the ideal weight .
They note that simple things like cutting back on treats and ensuring that your dog gets an adequate walk or exercise can ensure they are healthy .
`` Even small changes can have big long-term effects , '' they said . `` Even just going a few extra blocks can have a big difference and if you think about yourself , if you do n't exercise enough feel sluggish and not at your best and we have seen pets likely feel the same way too . ''

Pet owners in East Vancouver are being warned after at least two dogs came into contact with what appeared to be “ booby trapped ” food at Strathcona Park .
On April 3 , DJ Larkin and their dog , Silas , were at Strathcona Park . Silas was playing with other dogs , but then ran off and began eating something .
“ It was a piece of what looked like pizza wrapped up with sewing threads , with about seven feet of thread sewn through it , ” Larkin said . “ I was really scared that it could be dangerous to him . ”
Larkin said Silas swallowed the pizza whole , so they were able to get it all out of him . They said the incident was cause for concern .
“ It was just sewn all together throughout the whole thing , you could n't do it by accident it seemed really intentional to me . ”
Larkin hoped the incident was a one off . It appears , though , it might not have been . The owner of Ball and Biscuit Pet Boutique says one of their dog daycare clients had a similar but scarier encounter at the same park just days ago .
“ The dog swallowed a piece of pizza , and they noticed that there was sewing needles and thread within the food . When they went to retrieve it , the dog was obviously in discomfort and so they rushed off to the ER , ” Carie Wong said . “ That 's when they found that there was a needle stuck behind the larynx . ”
That dog needed to have surgery and is recovering .
The city and the BC SPCA are now looking into the incidents .

Back when Japan was a rapacious imperial power , a small island near Hiroshima was a nerve center of its chemical weapons efforts . But if there are any toxic chemical agents still on Okunoshima , they 've been buried under hundreds of pounds of cuteness .
Approximately 300 rabbits are the main inhabitants of the four-kilometer Okunoshima Island , where abandoned factories are all that remain of the once-deadly World War II-era weapons program . A nearby elementary school needed to abandon its furry friends in 1971 , and the abandoned Okunoshima became the habitat of last resort . Thirty years later , the rabbit-packed island is now a tourist destination : `` The rabbits became popular for their adorable gesture asking for food , '' reports the Manichi Daily News .
Japan maintained an extensive chemical arsenal during its 20-year experiment in Asian conquest in the last century , including mustard gas , phosgene , and hydrogen cyanide . Between 1937 and 1945 , Japan is believed to have launched at least 889 chemical attacks during its occupation of China , resulting in tens of thousands of deaths . Over 100 tons of Japanese chemical munitions have been destroyed in China since the war ended , and remnants of the attacks occasionally resurface , as with the 2005 discovery of a chemical test-site in Mongolia that used Chinese prisoners as human guinea pigs .
The wartime effort caused so much shame to Japan that Okunoshima was erased from official maps , according to the paper . But now the island can boast of a far more adorable claim to fame , as the above video shows .

It 's no surprise that we here at Twinfinite love dinosaurs . This love letter to Jurassic Park in podcast form proves that pretty well , I think . When I saw that Primal Carnage was on the show floor , my eyes lit up . I immediately looked to the group that was with me and said , “ We must play this. ” I 'm glad we did .
Rawr , rawr , rawr , dinosaurs .
For those that are n't “ in the know , ” Primal Carnage is an asynchronous multiplayer game where one team of players try to survive as human mercenaries while the other team lives out all of their primal instincts as the dinosaurs . At PAX Prime , Reverb Games had their booth set up with each team on separate sides . I , of course , gravitated directly to the side with the raptors . I 'm a hipster like that .
Waiting behind a group of content PAX-goers , eyes aglow , I watched as hordes of dinosaurs charged into the human menace . As soon as it was my turn , I quickly jumped onto the open computer . It was then that the most horrifying thing happened : I had to choose a dinosaur . No one should ever have to choose a dinosaur . Painfully , I scrolled past several awesome looking dinosaurs , eventually deciding on , what else , the velociraptor .
Quick , agile , and stealthy , playing as a raptor was everything I wanted it to be . I was able to take my enemies by surprise , jump relatively high barriers in a single bound , and even pounce on them , biting furiously . I 'm not joking when I say that these raptors are fast . It 's fun and easy to rush Mercenaries with them . Especially when you use teamwork to rush them in groups .
Dilophosauruses ( Dilophosauri ? Dillies ? Dilos ? ) can spit their acidic spray on humans , both hurting and blinding them . Carnotauruses ( at least , I think that 's what they were ) , are able to sprint into ramming speed and send their adversaries flying through the air , their arms flailing hilariously from the ragdoll physics . You can even be a T. rex . The T. rex is huge and ridiculously powerful . It 's so big that it could n't even fit inside the building that some of the mercs were hiding in — a clever way of balancing something ludicrous like a T. rex when pitting it against tiny humans . The craziest of all the dinosaurs has to be the pteradons who can fly around the maps and pick up some easy prey . Lifting a player into the air and then dropping them to their death was a definite highlight . Not just of Primal Carnage , but of PAX in general .
And that 's all that anyone would ever want to play of Primal Carnage , right ? That 's why the game exists is to play as dinosaurs , after all . That 's what I thought , anyway , but as soon as I started playing as a human , I knew that their side was just as viable . And , more importantly , fun . The mercenary side can have abilities that range from dinosaur-blinding flares to dinousaur-binding nets . Using a specific class , the player can actually trap smaller dinosaurs in a net and pump bullets into them with double pistols . Or you can execute them with a knife if you 're into that sort of thing . Human snipers can take down pteradons with ease while the more powerfully equipped classes can show T-Rexes who 's boss .
As fun as the weapons and acts of dino-cide can be , failing as a human can be just as fun . Sprinting through the jungle with dinosaurs hot on your tail invites a feeling of dread that few games match . The sound effects , especially through the surround sound headphones at the booth , allow for an immersive experience that , as far as I 'm concerned , makes it . It managed to capture that horrifying feeling when a Witch is awoken in Left 4 Dead every time I saw a T. rex bounding at me or a raptor jump over a fence where I thought I was safe .
It 's a simple concept , honestly , but it 's the dedication to it that really pushes it over the top . Lukewarm Media has managed to create a dinosaur game that actually plays well . It 's every bit as fun as it should be . From everything that I 've seen of Primal Carnage , it manages to straddle the line so that it 's silly , not stupid . All of my favorite Jurassic Park memories came flooding back while playing it . That 's really all that I could ask for .
Pre-ordering Primal Carnage allows you access to the beta so that you can get your dinosaur killing on as soon as possible . I 'm not joking when I say that I would highly recommend it after the time I spent with it . Even with all of the great looking games I knew I was missing on the show floor , I still managed to squeeze in time to play Primal Carnage three times throughout the show . It 's telling that when PAX day three was coming to a close , I went to the Reverb Games booth just to get a little more time with it . There 's a reason that it won Best Multiplayer from us at PAX . My first “ post-PAX blues ” moment came when I realized that I would never be able to spend any more time at that booth . As someone who does not own a PC that can run it , all I want to do is find one as soon as possible .
Long-term DLC support has also been promised by Lukewarm . I 'm just wondering which will come first : a mod from the community replacing the human skins with dinosaurs carrying guns or an official skin pack that allows the same . Either way , that 's my first request ! * Nudge , nudge , Lukewarm *
I 've recently noticed my two daughters taking an interest in Minecraft , an imaginative video game in which players can build -- and take apart -- constructions out of three-dimensional cubes . It 's kind of like Legos on steroids .
At first , I was resistant to the idea of my young girls ( ages 7 and 11 ) playing video games . My sons -- and husband -- have always been the `` gaming '' junkies in our household . My girls have been more interested in singing , dancing and finding any excuse to be up on stage . Frankly , I liked that they were n't glued to a computer screen .
I did n't realize that by condoning this gendered disparity in my children 's play , I was inadvertently sending them a message that video games and computers are just for boys -- not to mention contributing to the nationwide wage gap .
According to the U.S. Department of Education , girls today are steering away from math , science and computers in record numbers . The percentage of women graduates in computer science is at a 39-year low . In the mid-1980s , 37 % of computer science majors were women ; in 2012 , that number had dropped to 18 % .
While women make up more than 51 % of the U.S. workforce , they hold just 26 % of computing-related jobs , according to the U.S. Department of Labor . In Silicon Valley , the numbers are even worse . Recent diversity data from tech giants like Facebook , Google and Yahoo reveal that women hold on average just 16 % of the tech jobs .
These statistics stand in stark contrast to the gains that women have achieved in fields like medicine , law and business . Labor Department numbers show that 34 % of physicians and surgeons are women ; 39 % of lawyers are women ; and 56 % of business professionals are women .
While the lack of women in the science , technology , engineering , and math ( STEM ) fields is attributed by some people to a lack of interest on the part of women , a more likely explanation is that societal beliefs , or stereotypes , color our view -- insidiously sending our girls the message that women do n't have strong math and technical skills and that men make better engineers and computer scientists .
So how do we reverse this trend ?
Sheryl Sandberg , the outspoken CEO of Facebook and a role model for women in technology , gave some interesting - and very simple advice on how we , as parents , can encourage our daughters to take an early interest in the STEM fields .
Sandberg 's advice ? Encourage our daughters to play more video games -- and even play with them -- to pique their interest in computers .
`` Computer games are the gateway to computer science , '' Sandberg said during a talk they gave in Philadelphia , Pennsylvania about gender equality in the workplace .
`` A lot of kids code because they play games . Give your daughters computer games , '' they said . `` Ask them to play them . ''
So what is the correlation between playing video games and interest in technology or STEM careers ?
According to Annie Murphy Paul , a writer for KQED 's Mind/Shift , playing action video games develops kids ' spatial skills , which are an important predictor of creative and scholarly achievements . As Paul explains :
`` High scores on tests of spatial ability taken at age 13 predicted something more surprising : the likelihood that the individual would develop new knowledge and produce innovation in science , technology , engineering and mathematics , the domains collectively known as STEM . ''
Referring to a study by University of Toronto researchers published in the journal Psychological Science , Paul writes that `` exposure to video games could play a significant role as part of a larger strategy designed to interest women in science and engineering careers . ''
And why do we care that our daughters develop an interest in science and technology ? Because tech is where the jobs are . And tech pays well .
As Sandberg points out , since high-tech jobs pay well , a gender gap in computer science ties into the larger U.S. wage gap , where on average women still make 70 cents to the dollar compared to men .

Mr Hogan signalled that the future of the peace process was central to Ireland 's case in Brexit negotiations , which are due to start in late March .
Mr Hogan was scathingly critical of Britain 's conduct of the Brexit process since the outcome of the referendum on June 23 . `` Clearly , Brexit is a mess and getting messier , '' they said in an interview with the Irish Independent .
But Mr Hogan said that to protect freedom of movement on the island , the British government would have to make an exception in the interests of the peace process .
`` Hopefully , the European Union will be able to persuade the British government in this situation that the island of Ireland and the peace process is a project worth protecting .
`` Various British ministers have indicated otherwise in the context of leaving the Single Market and the Customs Union . This would inevitably lead to a 'hard border , ' '' they said .
Mr Hogan 's comments came as British prime minister Theresa May hinted the UK would leave the Single Market and pledged to lay out their strategy for Brexit in the coming weeks .
Meanwhile , Mr Hogan has roundly rejected claims by Brexit campaigner Nigel Farage that Ireland may follow Britain 's example and leave the EU .
Mr Hogan launched a scathing attack on the Ukip MEP , calling them a `` juvenile delinquent hanging around corners in Brussels telling others what to do about the EU '' .
The commissioner said that although Mr Farage was a leading light in the Brexit campaign , they now had no clue what Britain 's next move should be . Mr Hogan also insisted Ireland `` has deep and long-standing links with mainland Europe '' .

Last week , Mr Farage said they did not support the view that Irish people were major supporters of EU membership . They pointed out that Irish voters had twice voted 'No ' in referendums on EU treaties , and they argued that if Britain could show it was better off outside the EU , Irish people would have a rethink on the issue in the coming two to three years .
But Mr Hogan said that Mr Farage had used EU taxpayers ' money in the past to intervene in an Irish referendum on the EU 's Fiscal Treaty in May 2012 . The commissioner said Mr Farage had distributed leaflets in Ireland with `` misinformation '' on the issue .
`` But Irish voters rejected their claims and endorsed the Fiscal Treaty . I 'm also confident that they completely underestimate Irish people 's deep and long-standing links with the peoples of mainland Europe . That was even cited in the 1916 Proclamation , which mentions 'gallant allies in Europe ' , '' Mr Hogan said .
The commissioner said Mr Farage was a leading figure in the campaign last summer to have Britain leave the EU . `` Now , they have no clue how the country should proceed . They have demanded that the prime minister should produce a plan - but they have none himself , '' Mr Hogan said .
The commissioner said if Mr Farage was sincere in their negative views about the EU , they should follow the example of the British commissioner , Jonathan Hill , and resign their position in Brussels .

Some members of Greece 's leftist-led government wanted to raid central bank reserves and hack taxpayer accounts to prepare a return to the drachma , according to reports that highlighted the chaos in the ruling Syriza party .
It is not clear how seriously the government considered the plans , attributed to former energy minister Panagiotis Lafazanis and ex-finance minister Yanis Varoufakis . Lafazanis was sacked from their post and Varoufakis resigned earlier this month . However , the revelations have been seized on by opposition parties who are demanding an explanation .
The reports on Sunday came at the end of a week of fevered speculation over what Syriza hardliners had in mind as an alternative to the tough bailout terms Tsipras has reluctantly accepted to keep Greece in the eurozone .
About a quarter of the party 's 149 MPs rebelled over proposals to pass sweeping austerity measures in exchange for up to €86bn ( £60bn ) in fresh loans . Tsipras has been struggling to hold the party together .
In an interview with Sunday 's edition of the RealNews daily , Lafazanis said they had urged the government to tap the reserves of the Bank of Greece in defiance of the European Central Bank .
Lafazanis , the leader of a hardline Syriza faction that has argued for a return to the drachma , said the move would have allowed pensions and public sector wages to be paid if Greece were forced out of the euro .

“ The main reason for that was for the Greek economy and Greek people to survive , which is the utmost duty every government has under the constitution , ” they said .
In a separate report in the conservative Kathimerini newspaper , Varoufakis was quoted as saying that a small team in Syriza had prepared plans to secretly copy online tax codes . It said the “ plan B ” was devised to allow the government to introduce a parallel payment system if the banks were closed down .
In remarks which the newspaper said were made at an investors ' conference on 16 July , Varoufakis said passwords used by Greeks to access their online tax accounts were to have been duplicated secretly and used to issue new pin numbers for every taxpayer to be used in transactions with the state .
“ This would have created a parallel banking system , which would have given us some breathing space , while the banks would have been shut due to the ECB 's aggressive policy , ” Varoufakis was quoted as saying .
Varoufakis stood down this month to facilitate bailout talks . They have been a strident opponent of the deal ever since .
Under the secret plan , which the report said was devised before Tsipras was elected in January , transactions through the parallel system would have been nominated in euros but could easily change into drachmas overnight .
Varoufakis told the Daily Telegraph that the quotes were accurate but some reports in the Greek press had been twisted , making it look as if they had been plotting a return to the drachma from the start .
“ The context of all this is that they want to present me as a rogue finance minister and have me indicted for treason . It is all part of an attempt to annul the first five months of this government and put it in the dustbin of history , ” they said .
The deputy finance minister Dimitris Mardas denied the government had ever discussed plans to take Greece out of the euro . “ I have repeatedly said that such discussions have never taken place at a government policy level , ” they told SKAI television .
FORT BRAGG , N.C. — A network security specialist conducting an inspection of Command Sgt . Maj. Gregory York 's office computer has uncovered 84 pieces of malware along with 200 gigabytes of photo and video pornography the senior enlisted leader alleges was uploaded by North Korean hackers , Duffel Blog has learned .
“ Those sons of bitches , ” York told reporters , angrily pointing out the obvious and cowardly attempt to besmirch the reputation of their unit 's most senior enlisted man . “ They do n't know who they 're messing with . And if they think for one second that I , or this unit , will be cowed by their attempts to undermine our reputation , they 'd better think again . ”
While malware had been distributed throughout the computer , the pornography was located in a folder labeled ‘ Training Schedule ' on the desktop and was organized into sub-folders by type , production studio , and video quality . “ The first tip-off we got that it was the North Koreans was all the bondage stuff , ” York explained . “ I mean , it 's a pretty straight line . North Korea ; totalitarianism ; prison camps ; super-hot sex stuff . It 's kind of sad if you think about it . ”
Ever since the North Korean-sponsored cyber-terrorist attack on Sony earlier this month , military network specialists have been on high alert for attacks .
“ This latest attack demonstrates a desire by the North Koreans to go beyond simply embarrassing a company , ” said Adm. Michael S. Rogers , commander of U.S. Cyber Command . “ Now they are trying to embarrass our military service members who — quite obviously — would never even think about viewing pornography on computers at work or at home . ”
The viewing or downloading of pornographic material on a classified government computer is normally a gross violation of the network user agreement , as well as being punishable under the Uniform Code of Military Justice . It is believed , York said , that North Korean hackers had this information and were attempting to malign the reputation of senior leaders , or perhaps use the information for blackmail .
Since the investigation began , memorandums have been sent to leadership throughout the Army , imploring them to come forward if they suspect that their computers have been compromised by North Korea . More than 300 senior leaders across the military have come forward to voice concerns , requesting immediate help from local information technology offices , while also hoping to access the pornographic content on the unit share drive “ so they know what to watch out for . ”
Those on the liberal left have always prided themselves on being more caring and compassionate than conservatives . People on the right , they insist , are narrow-minded and selfish , beholden to vested interests . They only care about money and themselves . They are bad people .
This is one of the most persistent myths of modern times . I 've never believed it . Selfishness transcends politics . Those on the left are just as given as conservatives to self-interest , bigotry and dislike of people different to themselves . And , my word , over the past couple of weeks , following Britain 's vote to leave the UK , have n't we seen just how . The illusion of the liberal-left 's inherent and exclusive capacity for compassion has truly been exploded . Consider the recent March for Europe in London , to demand that the will of the people be revoked and that corporate-backed oligarchy be restored . Rich , metropolitan types have shamelessly complained about the result because their holidays in Europe will henceforth become more expensive . They fear for their second homes in Tuscany and the south of France . People have been saying this openly . The burghers of north London fear they might no longer get dirt-cheap nannies and au pairs from Eastern Europe . They fret about the staff on the sainted NHS , staff trained at the expense of poorer countries who we in the UK have since hired on the cheap . Corporate types fear for the future of immigrant workers , those magnificently exploited souls who live six to a room on three-month contracts being paid a minimum wage or less . Such outrageous displays of greed have n't been witnessed since the heady days of Thatcherism .
Consider , too , the ceaseless insults hurled at the stupid , poor white people who voted to leave the EU . These are folk who struggle to maintain a first home , let alone a second – people who can barely afford to go on holiday at all . These are the fishermen , from Aberdeen to Hull to Ramsgate to Hastings to Cornwall , whose livelihoods have been devastated by the EU – the same fishermen taunted by Bob Geldof and their champagne-swilling chums . These are the people living in Peterborough and Boston who ca n't get doctor 's appointments or find school places for their children because hospitals and schools are overwhelmed . These are people whose small businesses have been ruined by Operation Stack in Kent , whereby lorries clog up the roads for miles , the result of Schengen Area free movement that has led to the mayhem in Calais . Consider those people in Wales who faced the daily , humiliating reminder that their economy was dependent on hand-outs from the EU . Consider , too , all these English people in Dover and Folkestone who know Poles and Latvians , not as cheap domestic staff but as neighbours , parents of their children 's schoolfriends , as equals . All these people slandered as vermin and racists .
The metropolitan left sneered at them from their secluded London villages or their homes in rural Derbyshire . Cloistered writers and academics seem oblivious to the negative effects of the EU , not least because none has experienced first-hand the adverse effects of EU policy . No newspaper editor has opted for a cut-price , cutting-edge columnist from Romania . As for people working in the building trade , in decorating , in plumbing , I can introduce you to many who have been undercut or seen their businesses go under . There are countless here in Kent who have left costly and crowded London for that reason . If you have a house , a mortgage and children to look after , you simply ca n't live as a footloose twentysomething singleton with no responsibilities . I 'm not sure how much the liberal-left realise just how repellent their brattish behaviour has been . But this has been coming for some time . Ever since the libertine cultural revolution of the 1960s , Labour and the orthodox left in the Western world have been in a long process of abandoning the working class , withdrawing into identity politics , rights for the self , for affirmation of the self . Hence , so-called progressives now care above all for their image as ‘ good people ' . Virtue signalling is the epitome of the new faux-compassionate , egocentric left . Hence the needy rhetoric about ‘ the world hating us ' for leaving the EU , the exhortations to ‘ hug an immigrant ' or wear safety pins to boast of one 's non-racist credentials . Everything 's about ‘ me ' . The liberal-left could n't understand why people would vote in the name of abstract principles such as ‘ democracy ' or ‘ freedom ' or ‘ self-determination ' , because they view everything in terms of their own money and their own public image . There was a time when it was Tories who sneered at the poor , who deplored them as stupid and feckless . This was in the loadsamoney era of the 1980s , during which the market ruled and we were beholden to the whims of capitalists and the sainted market . There was even a time , many years ago , when the left spoke of principles , of democracy and liberty . How the roles have been reversed . How strange that it 's mostly conservatives who now talk in abstractions , and it 's the left that obsesses about the markets and worry about the FTSE 100 , about their own money . They oppose democracy . They hate the poor and the old . They are despicable .
Donald Sloan is not your prototypical backup point guard . Though they submitted a fine senior year at Texas A & M , they are n't spectacular . To most , they lacked elite skills that would translate into making an NBA roster . They were only a mediocre 3-point shooter from the shorter 3-point line , they never averaged more than 3 assists per game , and while they are n't a bad athlete they were in no way comparable to the Russell Westbrooks , Derrick Roses , John Walls , and Eric Bledsoes of the NBA world . Physically , they are n't even on par with the Jeff Teagues and Mike Conleys of the world .
After going undrafted , they bounced around the D-League for a while before catching on for small stints with the Hawks , Pelicans , Cavs , and Pelicans again . At the end of the 2013 season , it looked as if Sloan would have to ply their trade overseas , but in July , they signed a 2-year contract with the young , loaded , and up-and-coming Indiana Pacers . When Indiana signed C.J . Watson just a week later , it looked as if Sloan would only stick around on their minimum salary to simply fill a roster spot .
Sloan helped the Pacers some in 2014 , filling in for Watson when they missed most of March with an injury . Their per-36 minute stats were n't exactly awful , but few Pacers ' fans saw Sloan as anything other than the nice guy at the end of the bench that probably did their best to make George Hill work hard in practice .
Yet , five games into 2014 , Sloan stands nearly alone as the bright spot of the Indiana season . After last night 's gutsy 31-point effort against the asupervisorstioned Wall , Indiana fans in search of light at the end of the tunnel are asking each other whether Sloan has a real future in the NBA .
The former Aggie is averaging 16 points , 7 assists , and 5 rebounds for the 1-4 Pacers . Sloan 's jump shot has improved dramatically , as evidenced by their four triples yesterday . Their playmaking has been a delightful addition to the stagnant Pacer offense . While their defense has n't exactly been stellar , he 's also been limited by the Pacers ' lack of a backup point guard due to injuries . Sloan has had to avoid foul trouble at all costs in order to stay on the floor and help their team .
Perhaps most impressive , though , is their evolution as a teammate , game manager , and leader .
Before the game in Atlanta , I asked Sloan what they were specifically focused on in order to help the team in their new role . Their answer was atypical from that of many young point guards . Sloan immediately focused on their teammates , demonstrating their knowledge of what a point guard in their position needed to do
“ You know mainly , I just want to get guys in the spots they need to be — making sure everything is running fluidly offensively and defensively , ” said Sloan . “ I 'm just being an all-around floor general , making sure guys are in gaps defensively , making sure guys are knowing assignments , and we 're getting play calls . I want to make sure everyone is aware of everything that 's going on . ”
Sloan 's mature answer was enlightening , and practically forced the follow-up question : “ How are you , as a guy that has n't been able to play much behind some other players , able to play so confidently and take control of the team ? ”
“ You have to believe in yourself and be confident in the player that you are , which I am , ” responded Sloan . “ I 've been playing with a lot of guys , even the guys that are hurting , and they are comfortable with me being out there . We 've got a lot of guys that are banged up right now , but even in the preseason when I was playing with them , they were real confident in me being out there , running the show , and telling them what to do . They were the guys that were playing all the minutes last year , the eight-year vets and all this stuff , but they were confident in letting me run the show and really listening . You know , I 've been in situations before where that really was n't the case — being the young , new guy where you do n't have guys that want to listen or who are willing to listen . These guys around me have really made it easy for me . ”
A good point guard will walk a fine line between involving themselves and involving their teammates . It has been said that the all-time great point guards were able to get everyone else involved for 44 minutes before taking over , if need be , down the stretch . A point guard that completely lacks self-awareness or self-identity will never max out their potential , and it appears that Donald Sloan has started to fully realize just what their role on this team is .
This was no more fully evident than when I asked them if they had one piece of advice for all the young point guards out there :
“ First of all , you have to know what your job is , ” they said . “ You have to know what you need to do coming into the game . A lot of point guards in the league think that they have to score first just because of the Russell Westbrooks and Damian Lillards . They think they have to go out there and put on a show or exhibition when that 's not the case at all . You have to go out there and make sure everybody , the other four guys , are where they need to be and then your shots are gon na come . I really just focus on my guys first . I know I can get my shots when I want them , but I have to make sure my wings are getting shots , my posts are getting touches , and that will open up so much for me later on in the game . It 's not about going out there and scoring 30 points . It 's about doing things the right way . ”
Sloan proceeded to go out and score 14 points while dishing out 7 assists in a game against Atlanta that was far closer than it should have been .
It 's unclear whether Sloan is a real NBA player that is proving it in the midst of their team 's injuries , or a player who is simply benefiting from a specific situation on a very bad team . All NBA players are supremely talented , and there have been many players that washed out of the league after scoring 30 points in a game . With Sloan , though , it 's the stuff outside the box score that should be encouraging . Early on in this season from hell , Sloan has demonstrated real value that could help an NBA team in the future .
Perhaps more impressive than the 31 points last night was the timing of those points . The Pacers got out to a really slow start before Sloan put them on their back , scoring 8 straight points on their way to eleven in the first quarter . They then scored the Pacers ' final 7 points of regulation to help force overtime .
In between , they were able to dish out seven assists and was the one Pacer who seemed to take it upon themselves to find open looks for Chris Copeland . Throughout it all , Sloan 's hustle and grit were indicative of the entire Pacers ' squad . At no point in the last four losses have the Pacers ever given up , and while moral victories really do n't translate into anything tangible , Sloan was quick to point out that the effort they were putting out would pay future dividends .
“ The injured guys are looking and they 're eager to get back with us , ” said Sloan . “ If anything , it 's making us that much closer as a team and not just as a first group having to go through it or the normal five having to go through it . We 're not just playing the background anymore . I think at this point , once the guys come back , everyone will have the feeling that we can get over the hump together . ”
Reality says that Sloan is not a superior player to either George Hill or C.J . Watson . Nobody knows whether Sloan would be as effective in a diminished role while playing less minutes per game . A point guard like Sloan who excels at reading the rhythm of a game ( think , the bizarro Kyrie Irving ) may not be as effective in only 12 minutes a night . This much is certain though : Donald Sloan , right now , makes the Indiana Pacers a better basketball team .

Saudi Arabia 's delegation to the Arab League meeting held in Cairo on Friday , March 11th stormed out of the meeting during Iraqi Foreign Minister Ibrahim al-Jaafari 's speech .
This Arab League meeting was an emergency meeting , which took place following a recent escalation in accusations between Hezbollah and Saudi Arabia , and after Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah , Hezbollah 's Secretary General , accused Saudi Arabia of its implication in a number of bombings in Lebanon since 2005 .
This emergency meeting , headed by its newly appointed Secretary General Ahmad Aboul Gheit ( who shares good relations with Israelis ) witnessed a vote to brand Hezbollah a terrorist organization , just days after the Persian Gulf Cooperation Council ( PGCC ) did the same . The vote passed , although Lebanon and Iraq abstained .
The PGCC 's decision had come a day after Nasrallah accused Saudi Arabia of pressuring Lebanon to silence their group .
`` Saudi Arabia is angry with Hezbollah since it is daring to say what only a few others dare to say against its royal family . ”
Saudi Arabia , whose relationship with Israeli diplomatic circles has become even more apparent of late stormed out during al-Jaafari 's speech , in which they said that “ al-Hashd al-Shaabi and Hezbollah have preserved the dignity of the Arabs , and those who call them terrorists are the terrorists . ”
Al-Hashd al-Shaabi ( Iraqi popular mobilization forces ) and Hezbollah have both been embroiled in heavy combat against ISIS and al-Qaeda in both Iraq and Syria .
In January , Iraq summoned the Saudi ambassador following suggestions they made that al-Hashd al-Shaabi was exacerbating sectarian tensions in Iraq .
The Saudi delegation withdrew during al-Jaafari 's speech to protest their refusal to brand Hezbollah a terrorist organization , and their defense of both resistance organizations .
As for Lebanon 's position , Foreign Minister Jebran Bassil related on Twitter that : `` We voiced reservations because the resolution was not in line with the Arab anti-terror treaty ... Hezbollah enjoys wide representation in Lebanon and it is a main component in the country . ''

Governor Greg Abbott : High-speed trains must never ever , forever ever never , be a `` money-losing proposition . ''
Even if Greg Abbott thinks that bullet trains in Texas are a complete waste of dough , it might be wise , in the future , to not actually say that out loud . Because when has a large-scale transportation project in Texas ever turned a profit ? Last Thursday during a Greater Waco Chamber of Commerce gathering , Governor Abbott , as reported by the Texas Tribune , said proposed high-speed rail projects can not be a “ money-losing proposition. ” “ Because of the price of oil , we 're dealing with a little bit tighter budget , and so we just need to be responsible budget-wise , ” said Abbott , who added , “ It is important to be able to invest in anything that works , but when you invest , you do n't want to lose money . You 've got to proceed with caution. ” Well , yeah . If another large-scale public transportation project were n't already hemorrhaging or about to bleed out a ton of money , this would n't be Texas . Or America . Or Planet Earth . And the English language might not have the lovely word `` boondoggle '' in its lexicon.In 2011 , thefound that the Austin area Central Texas Turnpike System ( Texas 130 , Loop 1 and Texas 45 North ) , constructed and currently operated by the Texas Department of Transportation , had hit a $ 100 million shortfall in debt repayments . As a result , TxDOT was forced to turn to state subsidies , such as gasoline taxes , to try to reel in some of the cascading debt.As of September 30 , 2016 , Houston 's METRO system of light-rail trains and buses was buried in nearly $ 1.2 billion in debt , states METRO 's financial records . According to an April 2016 City of Houston-sponsored study , city officials were considering another bond referendum that would hoist more tax burden on local taxpayers.And according to a TxDOT report released earlier this month , it would take $ 36.7 billion ( that 's right , ) to pay off the debt from Texas ' 53 toll roads and 28 financial tolling systems.Whether it 's the proposed Texas Central High-Speed Railway ( which would introduce bullet-train service between Dallas and Houston ) or TxDOT 's Texas-Oklahoma Passenger Rail Study ( there 's talk of building an Interstate 35-hugging rail line from Laredo through Corpus Christi , San Antonio , Waco , the Dallas-Fort Worth area and up to Oklahoma City ) , it 's unlikely that revenue will outpace operating costs and debt repayment.But at least with high-speed , electric-powered trains , air pollution will drop and water quality might also improve , proponents say . Unlike those yucky , ozone-layer-killing cars that drive Texas ' toll roads , which ( go figure ) are n't making money for the state.In completely , totally , absolutely , positively , 100-percent unequivocally unrelated news , the 2017 Texas State Legislature is just 112 days away .

SDSU AthleticsSouth Dakota State 's Cole Langer ( 54 ) has a famous surname when it comes to Jackrabbits ' football , and he 's quite proud of it . Brian McLaughlin @ BrianMacWriter
Every college football program talks about possessing a 'family atmosphere ' , and for the most part it is easy to believe when it comes to the FCS level .
With one program in particular , you actually hear it more frequently -- not just in the figurative sense , but also the literal . South Dakota State football has a 'family atmosphere ' because that 's the only way 20-year head coach John Stiegelmeier would have it . And if you believe the term 'family ' includes all of the past players and alumni , Coach Stig 's chalice runneth over .
The surnames Vinatieri and Langer should resonate with anyone who knows NFL football–and more importantly , SDSU football . Those names are part of this family , for sure . Adam Vinatieri was a placekicker for the Jackrabbits in the early 1990s and has gone on to kick in the NFL for 20-plus years , and if you do n't believe it , just tune in to the Indianapolis Colts ' game this weekend . Jim Langer played for SDSU in the 1960s and went on to a 12-year , Hall of Fame career in the NFL .
RELATED : Missouri State 's Dylan Cole having a crunch 2016
Between these two , six Super Bowl rings and two Halls of Fame careers have been forged ( trust us , Vinatieri will make Canton ) . And up in Brookings , S.D. , there are a nephew and a grandson who grin ear-to-ear when talking about their famous relatives . Freshman placekicker Chase Vinatieri is the nephew of the famous kicker , while senior defensive lineman Cole Langer is the grandson of the current Hall of Famer . Both SDSU players are standouts for the nationally ranked Jackrabbits .
Do their names attract attention ? Yep .
`` Oh it happens all the time , '' Chase told HERO Sports . `` When I 'm out and about or if I meet new people , I tell them my name and they ask me if I 'm related to the kicker and I tell them , 'Yeah , that 's my uncle ' . Everybody finds that pretty cool . I 'm nothing at all , yet . He 's the big man . ''
Chase saw their uncle this summer on July 4 , venturing to Indianapolis to visit Uncle Adam and their family . They had the chance to visit the Colts ' training center , quite the experience . And yes ... if you need to know ... they have tried on the Super Bowl rings . And yes ... it was intoxicating .
Cole has had a chance to try on Super Bowl rings too . Their grandfather was the starting center for the 1972 Miami Dolphins ' team that finished 17-0 , as well as the 1973 team -- playing alongside five other future Hall of Famers . The 17-0 season in 1972 is a mark that has n't been matched . Cole has tried the rings on , you 'd better believe it .
`` It was pretty cool , '' Cole told HERO Sports . `` He also wears their Hall of Fame ring around a lot . I 've gotten to wear that and show it to my friends ... Every once in awhile I get asked about them around Brookings . They ask how my grandpa 's doing , that kind of stuff . I 've always had a good relationship with them and he 's always there for support , for whatever I need . They give tips here and there and their biggest advice is always to play like your hair is on fire . That 's how to play the game . ''
It truly is an example of what goes on at South Dakota State University -- it 's not a cliche when you 're talking about the Jacks . Recruits talk about it , current players talk about it , even rival coaches have picked up on it and acknowledge it when talking about the SDSU framework . Whether it 's a famous surname from the past ( and present ) or the third-stringer who has n't gotten many reps yet , you get the sense everybody matters .
`` We spend more time with our football players sometimes than we even get to spend with our own families , '' Stiegelmeier told HERO Sports . `` If you desire to know more about people than just their height , weight and 40-yard dash time , then it 's only natural you create that in your football program . ''
So whether it 's the surrogate family in Brookings or the uncles and grandpas who once called the same campus their home , family is the key word in this small town in South Dakota .
Most of you know that we 're very active on social media . We believe the digital platforms have allowed for more transparency and offer new ways for lawyers to help clients .
With this increased visibility and new technology come new responsibilities , rights and remedies . One huge concern for many is that of free speech and how your traditional Constitutional rights and remedies are affected when communications are made online .
Today , for the first time , the Supreme Court held , in a narrow ruling , that your Constitutional right to free speech holds true even to communications made on social media and , in this case , Facebook .
In the underlying case , a Pennsylvania man , Anthony D. Elonis , had posted several messages on Facebook that many interpreted as being violent . They were prosecuted and convicted under a federal threat statute . The arguments made by the prosecution at the initial trial level was that if a reasonable person believed this man 's Facebook communications were a threat , then they were in violation of the statute . Elonis was convicted and sent to jail for a 44-month term .
On final review , the Supreme Court held that is not the law . Chief Justice John Roberts wrote , “ Our holding makes clear that negligence is not sufficient to support a conviction. ” The court went on to hold that the legal standard used to convict this man was far too low or easy to meet . It pointed out that more is required other than whether or not a reasonable person would regard the communication as a threat .
Several of the Facebook comments included :
“ There 's one way to love you but a thousand ways to kill you . ”
“ Enough elementary schools in a ten mileradius to initiate the most heinous school shooting ever imagined . ”
During their trial , Elonis testified their Facebook posts were inspired by the rap star Eminem .
While we 're not big fans of anyone making these types of comments on the social platforms , it is noted that Elonis claimed they were an artist who turned to rap lyrics for therapeutic purposes to help them cope with depression . Regardless of the statements or reasons , what SCOTUS decided in this narrow case is that more than just negligence is required to convict .
At issue on the appeal of the underlying conviction was whether or not the government was required to prove intent or simply an easier to argue and prove “ reasonable person ” standard . The court agreed with counsel for Elonis and the later .
It 's important to note that , in this case , at one time or another , Elonis posted disclaimers stating they were exercising their freedom of speech . In the briefs , their counsel wrote , “ The First Amendment¹s basic command is that the government may not prohibit the expression of an idea simply because society finds it offensive or disagreeable . ”
In a well-written brief filed by the ACLU , it effectively argued that context does indeed matter .

Wild genes block growing rust threat
Rust resistance Researchers have identified two genes in ancient varieties of wheat that could combat a disease threatening one of the world 's major food crops .
Since 1999 , a fungal rust known as Ug99 has decimated wheat crops throughout Africa , Yemen and Iran . The rust targets the plant 's stem and leaves , robbing it of nutrients and reducing crop yield by up to 80 per cent .
The last major epidemic of fungal rust disease broke out in the 1950s , but was quelled with the introduction of a resistant strain of plants in the 1970s .
In a study published online today in the journal Science Express , researchers have shown that a gene known as Sr33 provides resistance against Ug99 .
Team research leader , Dr Evans Lagudah of CSIRO Plant Industry , says the research is part of a global effort to reduce the spread and impact of the disease .
`` The biggest concern is that it 's got a foothold in Iran , which is near Pakistan and India -- both big 'bread baskets ' , '' says Lagudah .
`` The fear is that once it gets into those countries the impact in terms of global food security would be enormous . ''
They say while Ug99 can easily be transported on clothing , it is also possible for the pathogen to float along air currents over large distances .
`` Not only has it migrated northwards into Yemen and into Iran , but has also moved southwards in South Africa . Historically the wind currents that move from Southern Africa move into western parts of Australia and eventually eastern Australia . ''
Tracking the immunity gene
Lagudah says the Sr33 gene , which is found in an ancient wheat relative known as goat grass ( Aegilops taushii ) , provides resistance against a range of fungal rust types .
`` It tends to show a broad spectrum resistance , but it 's not what you could call a strong immune response , '' they say . `` It allows some of the rust to grow , but it does n't allow the rust to grow fully . ''
To test the effectiveness of the Sr33 gene , researchers transplanted DNA from the wild goat grass into a commercial wheat variety , using a technique known as transgenics . This allowed the researchers to create new seedlings at a much faster rate than through traditional cross-breeding techniques .
They then used DNA fingerprinting to identify the location of the Sr33 genes .
`` [ We ] compare the plants that have the resistance with those that do not have the resistance and look for specific differences , '' says Lagudah . `` We were able to show that all these differences were 100 per cent associated with the presence or absence of this resistance against Ug99 . ''
In a second study , also appearing in Science Express , a US-led team of researchers investigated another rust resistance gene Sr35 . This gene was previously identified in an ancient wheat variety known as Titicum monococcum , which is closely related to bread and pasta wheat .
They found that Sr35 provides a stronger level of rust resistance against Ug99 than Sr33 . But , unlike Sr33 , it does not provide resistance against other rust strains .
Lagudah says short-term the outcomes of this research could be the development of wheat strains that contain both the Sr33 and Sr35 genes .
`` [ Ideally ] we 'd like to stick the genes together so that they go to one chromosome and make breeding much simpler … because two heads are better than one . ''
Tyabb police shooting : Boy , 11 , dies of head injuries , father shot by police at cricket oval
Updated
An 11-year-old boy has died from head injuries and their father was shot after threatening police with a knife at a packed cricket ground south-east of Melbourne .
Officers opened fire after failing to subdue the man with capsicum foam at Tyabb cricket oval on the Mornington Peninsula .
Paramedics called to the sports ground on Frankston-Flinders Road , around 6:30pm ( AEDT ) on Wednesday , treated the boy but were unable to revive him .
When police officers arrived at the scene they were involved in a confrontation with the boy 's father , who rushed at them with a knife .
The man , aged in their 50s , was then shot in the chest .
They were flown to Melbourne 's Alfred Hospital where they are in a life-threatening condition .
Witnesses say there was chaos at the scene as children were attending cricket and football practice .
Police Commander Doug Fryer described the incident as horrific .
`` His mother is clearly absolutely distraught and our thoughts and prayers go out to them and the extended family , '' they said .
Police say a number of people saw the incident and urged anyone who has not spoken to officers to contact them .
Wayne Murray lives near the oval and says they heard two gunshots .
They say they can not believe what happened .
`` I 've got an 11-year-old grandson at home , it 's scary . '' they said .
Officers are carrying out an examination of the oval , which is near Tyabb pre-school , and the road that leads to the sports ground has been closed .
`` The exact circumstances surrounding the incidents are yet to be established , '' police said in a statement .
Local police , detectives and the homicide squad are at the scene .
Police say the Professional Standards Command will oversee the investigation .

Environmentalists can be excused for feeling apocalyptic about Donald Trump 's presidency . Compared with Barack Obama , who championed the Paris Agreement , enacted the Clean Power Plan and preserved major swaths of open space , President-elect Donald Trump can come off as the planet 's grim reaper , ready to usher in a new era of dirty water , polluted air , and melting glaciers .
Trump 's cabinet selections make crystal clear that their anti-environment rhetoric as a candidate was no mere campaign swagger . To head the Environmental Protection Agency , they have tapped Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt , a man who has repeatedly sued the agency . For energy secretary , he 's picked Rick Perry , the former Texas governor who once vowed to eliminate that agency . For secretary of state , Trump has tapped ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson . To put the icing on the cake , they want to install Arctic oil drilling advocate Ryan Zinke , the House Republican from Montana , as interior secretary .
As League of Conservation Voters president Gene Karpinski has put it , the incoming administration looks to be “ a polluter paradise that is completely at odds with public support for protecting our air , water , lands , and wildlife . ”
But environmentalists may yet have a way to fight back . Though their public protests may fall on deaf ears as long as Trump is in the White House and Republicans control Congress , environmental activists may find more of an audience in corporate boardrooms . At a time when consumers are increasingly eager for green products , services , and energy sources , corporations are seeing the value of resource conservation as a long-term investment strategy , not just good PR or a grudging response to government regulations . And it 's not just Ben & Jerry 's these days that is taking earth flight attendantship , especially climate change , quite seriously ; sustainability is baked into the structure of more and more Fortune 500 businesses . The imperatives of profit have never been so closely intertwined with those of our finite planet .
Take Trump 's pledge to bring back coal . In economic terms , that 's a campaign promise that looks destined to fizzle . Simply put , natural gas , a significantly cleaner fuel than coal , has become a more economically viable energy source . David Victor , an energy policy expert at the University of California , San Diego , says that while the price per unit of energy for natural gas and coal are roughly the same right now , natural gas enjoys a decided market advantage , because 21st century grid operators prefer its properties as a fuel source .
“ Modern power plants need to be able to be turned on and off fairly quickly , but a coal plant is the exact opposite of that , ” says Victor . “ You need to keep a coal plant warm ; the ramp-up for a coal plant from a cold start is many hours , if not longer . Gas plants are much more responsive . ”
And the “ clean coal ” that Trump likes to reference ? It 's an idea that sounds seductive , but that does n't do much to reduce the nation 's greenhouse gas emissions . Clean coal refers to the application of carbon capture and storage technologies to coal-fired power plants—a process that involves diverting carbon dioxide from the smokestack and sequestering it underground in natural geologic formations that prevent it from seeping back to the surface . In practice , this technology is outrageously expensive . The only power plant in the world that has made the numbers come even close to working—the Boundary Dam Power Station in Saskatchewan , Canada—has done so by pumping the carbon dioxide into nearby oil fields , where it has value as an aid for fossil fuel extraction—a process known as enhanced oil recovery . But that can hardly be called a clean technology . While the process itself apparently is not polluting , it produces no net gain in terms of reducing greenhouse gas emissions—the entire point of clean coal . Just storing the CO2 in the ground would be a net improvement . But if the only economically feasible use of carbon capture is to extract more oil , it 's a zero-sum game . That 's because any oil extracted releases enough emissions when it 's burned to cancel out the potential benefit .
Making truly clean coal a financially viable reality would require massive government incentives , whether in the form of tightened-up emission standards or a price on carbon—both approaches that run counter to Trump 's fossil fuel-friendly , roll-back-the-regulations ideology . The technology holds promise in places like China , where the coal industry is booming , and the political appetite exists for a nationwide carbon market . But in the U.S. , clean coal is a non sequitur , both fiscally and environmentally , for the foreseeable future .
Even many of the coal company executives with whom Trump is trying to ingratiate themselves agree that natural gas is America 's new energy king . “ The basic economics of the power sector now favor gas , and that has come directly out of the hide of coal , ” says Victor .
NOT THAT TRUMP HAS N'T ALSO PROMISED to pump up domestic production of natural gas , which is by no means the holy grail of clean energy . It has about half the greenhouse gas emissions of coal , but the “ fracking ” technology used to extract much of the nation 's natural gas supply is fraught with environmental problems of its own , from air and water pollution to increased earthquakes and habitat destruction .
Nevertheless , some environmental advocates say natural gas offers a pragmatic alternative to dirtier fossil-fuel energy sources as a short-term bridge to buy time for wind and solar to scale up , given that the renewable energy industry is still in its infancy .
And scaling up they are . In 2015 , renewable energy sources accounted for two-thirds of the new electricity generating capacity in the U.S.—3,500 times greater than the new coal capacity . Investment in renewables is spurred on by the provisions of the Clean Power Plan , clean energy incentives in more than 30 states , and a pair of federal tax credits , which were authorized—with bipartisan support in Congress—through 2020 and 2021 . Even if Trump is successful in eviscerating these incentives , the clean-energy sector has enough legs at this point to continue expanding , albeit it is a reduced rate . For example , the 2016 Annual Energy Outlook , a publication of the U.S. Energy Information Agency , forecast that without the Clean Power Plan in place the growth of wind and solar would drop from 7.5 percent per year to 6 percent per year . Without the federal tax credits , the forecasted growth rate is cut in half .
“ The political coalition in favor of continued investment in renewables is much bigger and more powerful than [ it ] has been at any time in American history , ” says Victor , who is one of the authors of an upcoming Brookings Institution report that will offer recommendations on energy policy to the Trump administration . “ Trump themselves ca n't reverse the tax credits . The Republicans , as part of a tax bill , could undo that system of credits . But it 's not a simple left-right question—you have a number of red states in the middle of the country that are big wind producers , for example . ”
Thanks to the combination of market dynamics and government incentives , many of the world 's largest corporations already have plenty of eggs in the clean energy basket . Google , the world 's biggest corporate energy consumer , announced last week that it will be powered entirely by wind and solar in 2017 . “ I did n't think it would happen so fast … [ but ] we 've seen prices come down precipitously , which has helped us ramp up , ” one Google executive told Bloomberg .
Google is one of 83 major corporations that has publicly committed to operating with 100 percent renewable energy as part of the RE100 initiative , a joint project of the climate advocacy nonprofits The Climate Group and CDP ; Apple , Walmart , and GM are all on board . Microsoft reached the 100 percent renewable energy milestone in 2014 , and a majority of the other RE100 corporations are on track to do the same within a decade . The private-sector accounts for about half of the planet 's energy use , so having the biggest corporate trendsetters decide that renewable energy is a worthwhile investment tips the scales considerably .
Some of the world 's biggest transnational corporations , moreover , are even spending political capital on clean energy . During the Marrakesh climate talks , which unfolded rather quietly in the week of the U.S. presidential election last month , 365 companies signed a statement directed at the incoming administration , urging Trump to uphold the Paris climate agreement and embrace the global effort to dramatically reduce carbon emissions . Mars , Nike , General Mills , Hewlett Packard , Ikea , Intel , Kellogg , Monsanto , Dupont , Unilever , eBay , and Starbucks were among the largest and most influential companies represented .
Sue Reid , vice president of climate and energy programs for CERES , a nonprofit aimed at mobilizing the business community to take action on sustainability issues , and one of the groups behind the Marrakesh declaration , says that 10 years ago the idea that the private sector would lead the way on climate and other environmental issues would have seemed overly optimistic . But they are now fairly confident that , even if Trump does everything in their power to undermine the environmental movement , market forces will at least in part pick up the slack .
“ The economic equation has evolved so much , particularly in terms of the traction that clean energy has gotten with private sector entities , ” says Reid . “ So there is some real staying power now irrespective of what happens in terms of federal policy . ”
Not everyone agrees that private-sector environmentalism will offset the damage a Trump administration can do . Though the average global price of solar energy dropped 58 percent between 2010 and 2015 , it still provides just 1 percent of global energy supply . And Reid says just 18 companies purchase 60 percent of the renewable energy produced in the U.S. today .
“ We definitely need to move beyond that to the small and medium enterprises , ” they say . “ But part of getting to those price declines was the role of large companies making these commitments . It has allowed renewable energy developers to take those contracts to the bank and get cheaper financing . And that has had this beneficial snowball effect of driving down the cost . ”
There is also the uncomfortable fact that the U.S. , despite the efforts of the Obama administration , is not on track to meet its 2025 target of cutting emissions to one third of 2005 levels—nor are the signatories of the Paris Agreement on track to limit global warming to a maximum of 2 degrees Celsius . Which means the federal government needs to do more in coming years , not less .
David Festa , senior vice president for ecosystems programs at the Environmental Defense Fund , says he 's not fully convinced that the private sector will pick up where federal efforts lag under Trump , and will shepherd the environmental movement forward . “ Optimistic is probably too strong a word , ” says Festa . “ It 's more like an absence of pessimism . ”
But they say the EDF , which long ago migrated from a primarily “ sue the bastards ” approach to a strategy of “ aligning with companies to get things done , ” is a firm believer in harnessing market forces to achieve a sustainability agenda . In the 1990s , the organization was instrumental in persuading McDonald 's to do away with Styrofoam packaging , which snowballed into a successful global effort to curb ozone depletion . They see a similar phenomenon taking hold today on environmental issues ranging from climate change to habitat loss .
“ If you look at where some of the smartest and shrewdest business people are , where some of the most famous companies are , where the thought leaders are—including thought leaders on the right—they are looking at the need to be more resilient , the need to use our resources in a way that leaves more nature for future generations , ” says Festa . “ The next two years are going to be rough , no question . We are going to have to play a lot of defense . But if you step back and look at the longer time frame , the political pendulum will swing back to having productive conversations about the planet . In that light , I move from the absence of pessimism to cautious optimism . ”
( Picture above from Washington Wizards twitter @ WashWizards )
Wizards lose to Celtics 129-119 in OT . I 'm too depressed to write a short and long recap because Wizards had so many opportunities to win the game , but they did n't take advantage of them and are now down 2-0 in a series that has been much closer than the two double digit losses indicate . Instead , I will just write a recap focusing on the Wizards ' collapse . Here it is :
Markieff Morris started the game , and the first quarter went great for Washington just like it had in Game 1 . Wall finished the quarter with 19 points and 6 assists and was outplaying Isaiah Thomas , who had 15 . Zards were up 42-29 at end of 1 , but then the bench blew the lead again . The Celtics took a brief lead , but Wall took over again and put the Wiz up 67-64 at half and had 23 and 9 at the break .
The second half started off great . After a Marcus Smart three , Washington went on a 14-0 run and started to pull away , but the Celtics hit a barrage of threes to finish the third quarter only down by 5 . Wall had 35 and 11 , and Thomas only had 24 . Things were looking good until the fourth quarter happened . IT went off and showed everyone why they are called Mr. 4th Quarter , and next thing you know , the Celtics were up 102-99 . From there , the Wizards battled back to take the lead , the Celtics tied it up , and the Wiz had two chances to win it at the end of regulation . First Wall missed a tough midrange jumper , then Beal got the rebound and had an open foul line jumper that they put up just before the buzzer . As the ball was in the air many Wizards fans watching could hear Steve Buckhantz yelling “ DAGGER ” in their heads , but Beal airballed the shot , broke many hearts ( including mine ) , and the game was headed to overtime .
In overtime , the Wizards were clearly fatigued and the Celtics ran away with the game . When the buzzer sounded the Celtics won by a score of 129-119 and took a 2-0 series lead . Thomas dominated the 4th/OT and scored 29 of their 53 during these 17 minutes . They won the point guard matchup again , and like I keep on saying , the winner of the PG matchup is the winner of the series .
Final Stats :
Wall : 40 points and 13 assists
Thomas : 53 points
Beal : 14 points on 4/15 shooting

This research gives the results of a proximate analysis ( moisture , ash , crude protein , fat , total carbohydrates , and total energy ) ; a bioactive compounds analysis ( γ-aminobutyric acid [ GABA ] , ergothioneine , lovastatin , and cordycepin ) ; fatty acid and amino acid analysis ; and an analysis of macro- and microelement content of fruit bodies and mycelia of 15 higher Basidiomycetes medicinal mushroom strains belonging to 12 species . The results obtained demonstrate that almost all investigated mushrooms were found to be good sources of proteins and carbohydrates , with content varying in the ranges of 8.6-42.5 % and 42.9-83.6 % , respectively . Different species exhibited distinct free amino acid profiles . The total amino acid content was highest in Ophiocordyceps sinensis ( MB ) ( 23.84 mg/g ) and Cordyceps militaris ( FB ) ( 23.69 mg/g ) . The quantification of the identified fatty acids indicated that , in general , palmitic acid , oleic acid , stearic acid , and linoleic acid were the major fatty acids . The micro- and macroelement compositions were studied , and the highest results were ( as milligrams per kilogram ) 224-7307 for calcium , 1668-38564 for potassium , 1091-11676 for phosphorus , and 5-97 for zinc . Bioactive components were lovastatin , GABA , and ergothioneine , which are commonly found in most mushrooms . C. militaris ( FB ) , Pleurotus ostreatus ( FB ) , and Coprinus comatus ( FB ) were most abundant and contained a high amount of GABA ( 756.30 μg/g , 1304.99 μg/g , 1092.45 μg/g , respectively ) and ergothioneine ( 409.88 μg/g , 2443.53 μg/g , 764.35 μg/g , respectively ) . The highest lovastatin content was observed in Hericium erinaceus ( FB ) ( 14.38 μg/g ) and Ganoderma lucidum ( FB ) ( 11.54 μg/g ) . In contrast to C. militaris ( FB ) , cordycepin was not detected in O. sinensis ( MB ) . The fruit body biomass of C. militaris cordycepin content reached 1.743 mg/g dry weight . The nutritional values of the mushroom species studied here could potentially be used in well-balanced diets and as sources of bioactive compounds .
An article in a Chinese magazine called Study Times held up Singapore 's system of pseudo-democracy as a possible model for China . So what , you might reasonably ask , does that tell us about Xi 's thoughts ? The journal is published by the Communist Party 's Central Party School , whose president is Xi himself . It 's the party 's leading policy journal . '' For several years , Xi has led a team investigating the Singapore model and envisaging how it might be applied to China , '' reports Jonathan Manthorpe of the Vancouver Sun . Their tyre-kicking included a 2010 meeting with the owner and builder of the Singapore model , Lee Kuan Yew , whose son has been entrusted with the keys and is now taking it for a drive as Prime Minister . Exactly what is the attraction of a city-state that has been variously described as an illiberal democracy , a liberal authoritarian state and Disneyland with the death penalty ?
The piece in Study Times explains the attraction for China 's leaders . '' Since 1968 , the People 's Action Party has won consecutive elections and held state power for a long time , while ensuring that the party 's high efficiency , incorruptibility and vitality leads Singapore in attaining an economic leap forward , '' writes Song Xiongwei , a lecturer at the Chinese Academy of Governance . Lee deservedly gets credit for building a thrusting first-world economy from a malarial third-world swamp . Xi might be looking at Singapore 's past as China 's possible future . A political scientist at China 's Renmin University , Zhang Ming , says : `` The Singapore model has been admired by most Chinese leaders and Xi might see Singapore 's success as the dreamed accomplishments of their rule in coming decade , '' according to the South China Morning Post . Lee Kuan Yew is a shrewd character who created the appearance of a Western-style liberal democracy where , in theory , power is contestable but , in fact , one-party rule is protected . He 's done this by altering a couple of key design details . When an opposition politician criticises a government minister , the minister commonly sues for defamation . Singapore 's helpful courts award such crushing damages that the opposition politician is bankrupted and some have been forced into exile to avoid jail . Singapore 's media is closely guided by the government . Internet censorship and monitoring is highly developed . And the ruling party maintains a subtly coercive role in managing the value of the typical family 's most valuable asset , the family home .
How ? Most citizens buy flats in government-built and government-maintained apartment blocks . Blocks whose residents dare vote for the opposition live under explicit threat of having their essential upgrades put at the bottom of the work program . Hey presto . A parliamentary democracy where no one is dragged away in the middle of the night by the secret police , yet one where few are brave enough to speak out and even fewer get away with it . Even today , the PAP holds an astonishing 81 out of the 87 seats in parliament . A more charitable description of Singapore is that it 's a Confucian democracy , with a benign all-knowing patriarch presiding over a meritocratic civil service and a successful government-led capitalist economy . For China , it 's a potential halfway house between authoritarianism and liberal democracy . Could the governance system of an extended shopping centre with a population of 5 million be successfully applied to a sprawling civilisation of 1.3 billion ? It 's an intriguing question . Whether Xi has yet found an answer of how to reform China 's political system , they are surely asking the right question . Problems are mounting in China and the political system allows the people neither satisfaction nor safety valve .
While the people recognise the rapid rise in national prosperity , they are increasingly dissatisfied with the side effects . Eighty one per cent of Chinese people agree with the proposition that the `` rich just get richer while the poor get poorer '' , according to a study published this month by the Pew Research Centre , a pollster in Washington . Trust in the value of hard work is eroding . Forty-five per cent of middle-class Chinese disagree with the thought that `` most people can succeed if they are willing to work hard '' . Pew reports : `` In another sign that many do not see a level playing field in Chinese society , there are growing worries about corruption . Half now say corrupt officials are a very big problem , up 11 percentage points since 2008 . '' Their concern , presumably , would grow if they were allowed to read the The New York Times investigation into the wealth of the family of the outgoing Premier , Wen Jiabao , whose close relatives are estimated to have controlled assets worth at least $ US2.7 billion ( $ 2.6 billion ) .
The story has been censored in China and denounced by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs as a smear . And the extended family of Xi themselves is estimated by the US financial news service Bloomberg to have $ US376 million in assets . Bloomberg says none of these is owned by Xi or their immediate family and says that there is no indication Xi is guilty of any wrongdoing . This story was censored too . Winston Churchill said that dictators ride tigers they dare not dismount . How daring is Xi Jinping ? In last week 's column I wrote that Paul Keating was central to the creation of APEC . A reader has pointed out that Bob Hawke created the institution of APEC and Keating was instrumental in later adding an annual leaders ' summit . Loading

The Big Bang theory is a major marvel of science . It is a conclusion drawn from the collusion of several scientists ' work and observation that all fit together and formed a theory so vast as to explain the universe itself . No one mind can be credited with the idea ; Albert Einstein 's General Theory of Relativity served as the nidus , and Georges-Henri Lemaître built on that to propose the Big Bang . Observations of Edwin Hubble and George Gamow also played a role in writing the birth of the universe .
But the poet Edgar Allan Poe may have beaten them to it by a hundred years .
Poe was a American poet , story author , editor and critic known for their particularly macabre tales , early detective fiction , and participating in the American Romantic Movement in regards to literature .
For all of their life , Poe was fascinated with the stars and their mysterious workings . They followed the popular astronomy books of their time , but had no natural aptitude for math , nor a specific education in either astronomy or physics . Nevertheless , it is the year 1848– only a year before Poe 's death– Wylie and Putnam publishing released a prose poem that Poe spent years writing ; the poem was called “ Eureka ” , and was a dismal failure . The first printing was only 500 copies .
In an era where the predominant view of the universe was that it was static and unchanging , only the size of what we call a galaxy , and some areas were still trying to convince fundamentalists that the Earth orbited the sun , Poe made a daring move . In “ Eureka ” , Poe postulated that the universe had a definite beginning , and that this beginning was as a single , unique primordial particle . The primary nature of this particle , they describe , is its oneness– its Unity . Poe continues to explain how at the universe 's inception , the Unity was surrendered and gave way to the abnormal condition of many , but the lost aspect of Unity was something that allowed this particle to be divided infinitely and not to be “ totally exhausted by its diffusion into space . ”
Further , they suggested that the particles which arose from this division are attracted back to one another ( a concept they acknowledge came from Newton ) , and thus inexorably pull back toward each other in defiance of the energy which first split , then repelled them . They go so far as to say everything with a beginning must have an end , and they believed the universe would end again as a single , primordial particle regaining Unity .
But science of the era paid their discourse no mind . Perhaps it was an announcement at the beginning of their work that stayed the interest of their contemporaries : “ I design to speak of the Physical , Metaphysical and Mathematical—of the Material and Spiritual Universe—of its Essence , its Origin , its Creation , its Present Condition and its Destiny. ” Maybe their stated purpose was too grand for the era .
Some theorize that “ Eureka ” was Poe 's life work , and that he 'd bore that particular piece in mind , mulling and concentrating their ideas for years before they died . In “ Eureka ” Poe also referred to a sequel that they never had the chance to write .
Vayalar ( Kerala ) : A thin man in white mundu ( a garment worn around the waist ) and shirt , with a pencil moustache and dyed black hair , hurriedly walks towards a noisy hall in Vayalar , in Kerala 's Alappuzha district , with their hands raised .
They are V.C . Das , 95 .
Seventy years ago , they were part of an agitation which culminated in the Punnapra-Vayalar revolt , probably the only time an organized working class in India had led an armed revolt against a government .
The agitation saw an army of the poorest of the poor , armed with tools such as areca nut staves , come face to face with armed police .
“ Indian working classes , to be sure , have conducted long , bitter strikes , and peasants have staged sustained revolts in the countryside . But only once , it appears , have workers in an industry fashioned weapons , set up armed enclaves and fought the military in pitched , if one-sided , battles , '' Robin Jeffrey , media scholar , has written in Indian Economic and Social History Review .
Why did the workers take up arms when none of their contemporaries in India had done so ?
The agitation was a tipping point for the labourers , who were being harassed by the then ruler of the region , C.P . Ramaswamy Aiyer . Aiyer , the diwan of Travancore , had the full backing of the British government and had just implemented governance reforms which gave them absolute powers like that of an American president , former Kerala chief minister V.S . Achuthanandan said in an earlier interview . “ For instance , just take the case of fishermen . Half of whatever they get would go into the hands of the landlord . Half of the rest would go to the Church ( in memory of the soul of the dead landord ) . It was called Valla-karam and Palli-karam . There was nothing left for them after paying these two , '' said Achuthanandan .
At 24 , Das was not a member of the action group which actually stormed the police camp . They were a worker at a coir factory .
At night , they assisted S. Kumaran , one of the leaders of the movement , who was living underground .
According to some accounts , some 50,000 men and women participated in the attack . A majority of them were trade union workers .
Inevitably , hundreds died . Das says there were no real means to calculate how many . “ Newspapers were banned , we were not allowed to step outside the house post the police camp attack . Anything suspicious ( for the police ) dropped dead . '' they said .
So , where did they bury all of those hundreds ?
Das points to the ground beneath a statue of a black man with an areca nut stave aside the hall which was erected in memory of the agitation . “ This place was a huge pond then , now it looks like a hill to you ? '' they asked .
“ We buried the dead in that pond , threw soil over it , '' they said .
The revolt is named after two of the places involved . It started under the leadership of undivided Communist Party of India ( CPI ) in a place called Punnapra on 23 October , and lasted for 10 days until it culminated in Vayalar .
The uprising resulted in the displacement of Iyer and the establishment of an independent Travancore the year next .
“ To the communists , it was the finest flowering of the working class against the exploitative forces of the establishment ... the anti-communists think ignorant and innocent workers involved in the revolt were misled by CPI in directing workers to use areca nut staves against machine guns , culminating in a massacre , '' historian N. Sasidharan wrote in academic journal Samyukta in 2001 .
While Venezuela 's president Hugo Chávez is fighting for their life in Cuba , the liberal press of both sides of the Atlantic ( e.g. , El Pais ” ) has not stopped trashing their government . The significance of their victory ( 12 points ahead of their contender ) has yet to be analysed properly , with evidence . It is remarkable that Chávez would win , sick with cancer , outgunned by the local and international media ( think of Syriza 's Greece election ) and , rarely acknowledged , an electoral map extremely biased towards the middle and upper classes , with geographical barriers and difficult access to Ids for members of the working classes .
One of the main factors for the popularity of the Chávez Government and its landslide victory in this re-election results of October 2012 , is the reduction of poverty , made possible because the government took back control of the national petroleum company PDVSA , and has used the abundant oil revenues , not for benefit of a small class of renters as previous governments had done , but to build needed infrastructure and invest in the social services that Venezuelans so sorely needed . During the last ten years , the government has increased social spending by 60.6 % , a total of $ 772 billion [ i ] .
Poverty is not defined solely by lack of income nor is health defined as the lack of illness . Both are correlated and both are multi-factorial , that is , determined by a series of social processes . To make a more objective assessment of the real progress achieved by the Bolivarian Revolution in Venezuela during the last 13 years it is essential to review some of the key available data on the social determinants of health and poverty : education , inequality , jobs and income , health care , food security and social support and services .
With regard to these social determinants of health indicators , Venezuela is now the country in the region with the lowest inequality level ( measured by the Gini Coefficient ) having reduced inequality by 54 % , poverty by 44 % . Poverty has been reduced from 70.8 % ( 1996 ) to 21 % ( 2010 ) . And extreme poverty reduced from 40 % ( 1996 ) to a very low level of 7.3 % ( 2010 ) . About 20 million people have benefited from anti-poverty programs , called “ Misiones ” ( Up to now , 2.1 million elderly people have received old-age pensions – that is 66 % of the population while only 387,000 received pensions before the current government .
Education is a key determinant of both health and poverty and the Bolivarian government has placed a particular emphasis on education allotting it more than 6 % of GDP . UNESCO has recognized that illiteracy been eliminated furthermore , Venezuela is the 3rd county in the region whose population reads the most . There is tuition free education from daycare to university ; 72 % of children attend public daycares and 85 % of school age children attend school . There are thousands of new or refurbished schools , including 10 new universities . The country places 2nd in Latin America and 5th in the world with the greatest proportions of university students . In fact , 1 out of every 3 Venezuelans are enrolled in some educational program . [ ii ] . It is also a great achievement that Venezuela is now tied with Finland as the 5th country with the happiest population in the world . [ iii ] .
Before the Chavez government in 1998 , 21 % of the population was malnourished . Venezuela now has established a network of subsidized food distribution including grocery stores and supermarkets . While 90 % of the food was imported in 1980 , today this is less than 30 % . Misión Agro-Venezuela has given out 454,238 credits to rural producers and 39,000 rural producers have received credit in 2012 alone . Five million Venezuelan receive free food , four million of them are children in schools and 6,000 food kitchens feed 900,000 people . The agrarian reform and policies to help agricultural producers have increased domestic food supply . The results of all these food security measures is that today malnourishment is only 5 % , and child malnutrition which was 7.7 % in 1990 today is at 2.9 % . This is an impressive health achievement by any standards .
Some of the most important available data on health care and public health are as following [ iv ] , [ v ] , [ vi ] :
* infant mortality dropped from 25 per 1000 ( 1990 ) to only 13/1000 ( 2010 ) ;
* An outstanding 96 % of the population has now access to clean water ( one of the goals of the revolution ) ;
* In 1998 , there were 18 doctors per 10,000 inhabitants , currently there are 58 , and the public health system has about 95,000 physicians ;
* It took four decades for previous governments to build 5,081 clinics , but in just 13 years the Bolivarian government built 13,721 ( a 169.6 % increase ) ;
* Barrio Adentro ( i.e. , primary care program with the help of more than 8,300 Cuban doctors ) has approximately saved 1,4 million lives in 7,000 clinics and has given 500 million consultations ;
* In 2011 alone , 67,000 Venezuelans received free high cost medicines for 139 pathologies conditions including cancer , hepatitis , osteoporosis , schizophrenia , and others ; there are now 34 centres for addictions ,
* In 6 years 19,840 homeless have been attended through a special program ; and there are practically no children living on the streets .
* Venezuela now has the largest intensive care unit in the region .
* A network of public drugstores sell subsidized medicines in 127 stores with savings of 34-40 % .
* 51,000 people have been treated in Cuba for specialized eye treatment and the eye care program “ Mision Milagro ” ; has restored sight to 1.5 million Venezuelans
An example of how the government has tried to respond in a timely fashion to the real needs of its people is the situation that occurred in 2011 when heavy tropical rains left 100,000 people homeless . They were right away sheltered temporarily in all manner of public buildings and hotels and , in one and a half years , the government built 250,000 houses . The government has obviously not eradicated all social ills , but its people do recognize that , despite any shortcomings and mistakes , it is a government that is on their side , trying to use its resources to meet their needs . Part of this equation is the intense political participation that the Venezuelan democracy stands for , that includes 30,000 communal councils , which determine local social needs and oversee their satisfaction and allows the people to be protagonists of the changes they demand . [ vii ]
The Venezuelan economy has low debts , high petroleum reserves and high savings , yet Western economists that oppose President Chávez repeat ad nauseam that the Venezuelan economy is not “ sustainable ” and predict its demise when the oil revenues stop . Ironically they do not hurl these dire predictions to other oil economies such as Canada or Saudi Arabia . They conveniently ignore that Venezuela 's oil reservoir of 500 billion barrels of oil is the largest in the world and consider the social investment of oil revenues a waste or futile endeavour . However these past 13 years , the Bolivarian government has been building up an industrial and agricultural infrastructure that 40 years of previous governments had neglected and its economy continues to get stronger even in the face of a global financial crisis .
An indication of the increasing diversification of the economy is the fact that the State now obtains almost as much revenue from tax collection as from the sale of oil , since it strengthened its capacity for tax collection and wealth redistribution . In just one decade , the State obtained US $ 251,694 million in taxes , more than its petroleum income per annum . Economic milestones these last ten years include reduction in unemployment from 11.3 % to 7.7 % ; doubling the amount of people receiving social insurance benefits , and the public debt has been reduced from 20.7 % to 14.3 % of GNP and the flourishing of cooperatives has strengthened local endogenous economies . In general , the Venezuelan economy has grown 47.4 % in ten years , that is , 4.3 % per annum . [ viii ] . Today many European countries would look jealously at these figures . Economists who studied in detail the Venezuelan economy for years indicate that , “ The predictions of economic collapse , balance of payments or debt crises and other gloomy prognostications , as well as many economic forecasts along the way , have repeatedly proven wrong… Venezuela 's current economic growth is sustainable and could continue at the current pace or higher for many years. ” [ ix ] .
According to Global Finance and the CIA World Factbook , the Venezuelan economy presents the following indicators . [ x ] : unemployment rate of 8 % ; 45,5 % government ( public ) debt as a percent of GDP ( by contrast the European Union debt/GDP is 82.5 % ) ; and a real GDP growth : GDP per capita is $ 13,070 . In 2011 , the Venezuelan economy defied most forecasts by growing 4.2 percent , and was up 5.6 percent in the first half of 2012 . It has a debt-to-GDP ratio comfortably below the U.S. and the UK , and stronger than European countries ; an inflation rate , an endemic problem during many decades , that has fallen to a four-year low , or 13.7 % , over the most recent 2012 quarter . Even The Wall Street Journal reports that Venezuela 's stock exchange is by far the best-performing stock market in the world , reaching an all-time high in October 2012 , and Venezuela 's bonds are some of the best performers in emerging markets .
Hugo Chavez 's victory had an impact around the world as they are recognized as having spearheaded radical change not only in their own country but in all Latin America where progressive governments have also been elected , thereby reshaping the global order . The victory was even more significant considering the enormous financial and strategic help that the USA agencies and allies gave to the opposition parties and media . Since 2002 , Washington channeled $ 100 million to opposition groups in Venezuela and this election year alone , distributed US $ 40-50 million there . [ xi ] But the Venezuelan people disregarded the barrage of propaganda unleashed against the president by the media that is 95 % privately owned and anti-Chavez . [ xii ] . The tide of progressive change in the region has started to build the infrastructure for the first truly independent South America with political integration organizations such as Bank of the South , CELAC , ALBA , PETROSUR , PETROCARIBE , UNASUR , MERCOSUR , TELESUR and thus have demonstrated to the rest of the world that there are , after all , economic and social alternatives in the 21st century . [ xiii ] . Following a different model of development from that of global capitalism in sharp contrast to Europe , debt levels across Latin America are low and falling .
The changes in Venezuela are not abstract . The government of President Chávez has significantly improved the living conditions of Venezuelans and engaged them in dynamic political participation to achieve it [ xiv ] . This new model of socialist development has had a phenomenal impact all over Latin America , including Colombia of late , and the progressive left of centre governments that are now the majority in the region see in Venezuela the catalyst that that has brought more democracy , national sovereignty and economic and social progress to the region . [ xv ] . No amount of neoliberal rhetoric can dispute these facts . Dozens of opinionated experts can go on forever on whether the Bolivarian Revolution is or is not socialist , whether it is revolutionary or reformist ( it is likely to be both ) , yet at the end of the day these substantial achievements remain . This is what infuriates its opponents the most both inside Venezuela and most notable , from neocolonialist countries . The “ objective ” and “ empiricist ” The Economist will not publicize this data , preferring to predict once again the imminent collapse of the Venezuelan economy and El Pais , in Spain , would rather have one of the architects of the Caracazo ( the slaughter of 3000 people in Caracas protesting the austerity measures of 1989 ) , the minister of finance of the former government Moises Naim , go on with their anti-Chávez obsession . But none of them can dispute that the UN Human Development Index situates Venezuela in place # 61 out of 176 countries having increased 7 places in 10 years .
And that is one more reason why Chavez 's Bolivarian Revolution will survive Venezuela 's Socialist leader .

The Carolina Hurricanes are currently on track to finish in the NHL 's top 10 in both power play and penalty kill efficiency for the first time in 14 years .
After a 3-for-5 effort on Sunday , the 'Canes man-advantage unit cracked the league 's upper third for the first time this season . The unit , which has been steadily improving for months , played a critical role in Carolina 's stretch of six consecutive goals to erase a 3-0 deficit .
USA TODAY Sports
Sporting a 19.5 percent overall conversion rate for the 2014-15 season , the power play has operated at a 28.8 percent clip since the All-Star break and a 34.4 percent rate over the team 's last 10 games . The 'Canes have tallied multiple power play scores in four of those 10 contests , winning all four .
The league-leading penalty kill has been a story for most of the season—so much that even the Oilers ' surprising 2-for-3 performance against it still failed to knock it out of the top ranking in the NHL .
The rise of the other special teams group , however , could result in the team 's first representation in the top 10 of both categories since 2000-01 .
Thanks to the diligent work of assistant coach Rod Brind'Amour , the 'Canes power play has discovered at last the importance of a net-front presence and found productivity through cross-ice passing .
Net Front Presence
Jordan Staal has been a massive game changer for the 'Canes ever since their December return from injury , but No . 11 's screen of Edmonton goalie Richard Bachman on Sunday demonstrated just how obstructive the 6 ' 4 '' , 220-pound hulk can be .

It 's hardly a wonder that Jeff Skinner was able to snipe their wrister into the open corner for Carolina 's third consecutive power play goal .
It 's also hardly a wonder that the 'Canes power play scores 9.9 goals per 60 minutes when Jordan Staal is on the ice and just 5.6 goals per 60 minutes when he 's not ( per Hockey Analysis data ) .
Creating Isolation on One Side
One period before Skinner scored past Staal 's screen to put the 'Canes ahead 5-3 , they had tied the game on the 5-on-3 after the 'Canes created a ridiculous amount of open space on Bachman 's glove side .
After working it down low , Elias Lindholm ( with the puck ) had an open Eric Staal in the slot , a very open Victor Rask on the opposite half-wall and an extremely open Skinner right across the goalmouth .

The Oilers defended this particular play quite poorly , but the ability to draw penalty killers all across an invisible line vertically down the middle of the rink before burning them on the opposite side has become a 'Canes specialty over the past month .
Implementing Both at the Same Time
The 'Canes ran basically the exact same play twice against the Islanders late last month and scored on it both times .
The following images are from different situations , but both times the 'Canes had a man screening then-Isles netminder Chad Johnson from the pass and a defenseman pinching on the opposite side for what became two tap-in goals .

Michal Jordan 's only other career goal came a week prior against the Senators , when they were found streaking wide open down the left side for an easy power-play conversion . Again , note the clear line formed when the 'Canes power play sucked opposing killers into a misbalanced formation .

Then , of course , there are also moments like this , which the Flyers might 've slightly regretted in hindsight :

The 'Canes man-advantage strategies are n't particularly complicated , but Brind'Amour has brought an element of planning and movement to the unit .
Gone are the moments from years past when it seemed like only the passer and the pass receiver were moving at all .
Both the puck and the players now seem continuously cycling , not merely trying to find the open man but trying to create an open man .
Regardless of how the 'Canes have done it , the power play has become one of the league 's best since the turn of the calendar , rallying from the bottom third to the top third in shockingly little time .
As the final weeks of a lost , if not failed season wind down , the tremendous momentum of both Carolina 's penalty kill and power play groups should create much-needed optimism for the thick of the Bill Peters coaching tenure ahead .

Rhonda Garelick , an English professor at the University of Nebraska , has a comment on John Galliano 's outburst in a Paris bar ( “ High Fascism “ ; NYtimes , 3-7-2011 ) . Garelick ca n't resist finding Galliano 's behavior symptomatic of fascist/Aryan tendencies deeply rooted in French culture—despite the fact that Galliano was fired and now faces persecution for uttering a racial insult . ( Of course , one might argue that these recent events simply indicate the triumph of the culture of critique in post-WWII Europe . ) The French are evil because during the German occupation , French women continued to dress fashionably :
“ Every woman in Paris is a living propaganda poster , the universal function of the Frenchwoman is to remain chic , ” wrote one fashion journalist in the early 1940s . “ Frenchwomen are the repositories of chic , because this inheritance is inscribed in their race , ” wrote another .
That 's not the worst of it :
And as Vichy continued to toe the Nazi line about Aryan physical fitness , more French fashion magazines began focusing on exercise and diet for women .
Ah , the horrors of National Socialism , encouraging women to eat well and be physically fit .
But even more horrifying than physical fitness , these Aryan standards of beauty are still with us . After all , who won the war anyway ?
And although we insist on the racial diversity of fashion 's current standards of beauty , the fascists ' body ideal has persisted and expanded far beyond Europe . The hallmarks of the Nazi aesthetic — blue eyes , blond hair , athletic fitness and sharp-angled features — are the very elements that define what we call the all-American look , still visible in the mythic advertising landscapes of designers like ( the decidedly non-Aryan ) Ralph Lauren and Calvin Klein .
This is a fairly routine exercise emanating from the highest reaches of the mainstream media expressing Jewish hatred and revenge seeking against Whites and especially Nordic-looking Whites . One is tempted not to make too much of it except that the issue of physical beauty and health goes to the heart of the long conflict between Jews and non-Jews over the construction of culture . There is a long history of Jewish hostility to Western concepts of physical beauty , going back to the war of the Macabees against the Greeks commemorated at Hanukkah . The standard Jewish interpretation is that it was a rebellion against the Greek concept of physical beauty as a value in itself , as opposed to Jewish “ holiness ” as the ultimate virtue ( which , being a bit cynical , I would parse as group commitment ) . Especially abhorrent to the Jews was the Greek practice of honing their bodies in gymnasia .
Tom Sunic has written extensively about this topic for TOO : “ The Artful Race “ and their 5-part series , “ Beauty and the Beast. ” The ideal of Aryan physical beauty was an aspect of 20th-century racial science , and during the National Socialist period there was a revival of classical art :
Numerous German sculptors worked on their projects while benefiting from the logistic and financial support of the National Socialist political elite . Their sculptures resembled , either by form , or by composition , the works of Praxiteles or of Phidias of ancient Greece , or those executed by Michelangelo during the Renaissance . The most prominent German sculptors in the Third Reich were Arno Breker , Josef Thorak , and Fritz Klimsch… .
In “ The Artful Race ” Sunic mentions the Frankfurt School as dedicated to subverting Western images of physical beauty–a theme also of Elizabeth Whitcombe . ( My chapter on the Frankfurt School discusses a different kind of subversion of the healthy : family life . Children with strong ties to their parents and a sense of pride in their families are said to be forerunners of fascism and anti-Semitism . ) Lasha Darkmoon illustrates the subversion of the beautiful by Jewish critics and art collectors in their “ The plot against art “ ) . And Michael Colhaze juxtaposes images of women by Lucian Freud and Sandro Botticelli .
Garelick 's little article is in the tradition of Jewish antipathy toward the physical beauty of Europeans and for the value that Europeans place on physical beauty . I suspect that these traits of Europeans are an aspect of European individualism . Peter Frost has argued convincingly that there was sexual selection for traits like blond hair and blue eyes ( Peter Frost , “ European hair and eye color : A case of frequency-dependent sexual selection ? ” Evolution and Human Behavior 27 ( 2006 ) 85–103 ) . This means that traits like blond hair and blue eyes were seen as sexually attractive—like the peacock 's tail , so the became more common in the population because they were sought after in mates . Frost associates sexual selection among Europeans with monogamy as a marriage system , selected for in the northern areas where Whites evolved because of the need for fathers to provision children . Rather than marry on the basis of known kinship relations and family dictates , marriage is based on individual choice . And one criterion of importance ( among others ) is physical beauty .
Such selection pressures would also lead Europeans to value love as the basis of marriage–analysed as a trait that makes close relationships between spouses mutually rewarding . John Murray Cuddihy remarked on how love was seen as foreign by Jews emerging from the ghetto , resulting in theories like Sigmund Freud 's where love was analyzed as repressed sexuality—little more than a neurosis . * Nor was physical beauty in marriage partners valued among Jews . A passage in the Talmud says that physical appearance was not to be a critical resource for a woman : “ For ‘ false is grace and beauty is vain . ' Pay regard to good breeding , for the object of marriage is to have children. ” Instead of personal attraction , arranged marriages were common into the modern era .
Hence the culture clash exemplified by Garelick , abetted by Jewish historical grudges against the West .
And as for why White standards of beauty still predominate , there 's still quite a few of us around who appreciate the aesthetic exemplars of our race and we buy stuff . Try selling clothes with Lucian Freud-type models .

Shark deterrent technologies discussed at meeting of world experts in Sydney
Updated
Shark experts from around the world are meeting in Sydney today to discuss the best technologies available to stop shark attacks .
The summit was called after a number of attacks and sightings in New South Wales this year , including a fatal attack on a Japanese Surfer at Ballina on the north coast in February .
An independent review into shark deterrent technologies , commissioned by the NSW Government , identified a number of options for potential trials in NSW waters , including electrical and physical barriers , sonar detection and tracking .
However , the review found that only one deterrent - a shark spotting program - was suitable for immediate trial .
About 70 experts have gathered at Taronga Zoo to discuss the results of the review .
They will discuss ways to develop other ideas , including bubble curtains , shark repellent cables and personal shark shields .
Lecturer in Public Policy at the University of Sydney Christopher Neff is among the speakers and said netting and culling sharks would be out of step with public opinion .
Dr Neff said new research showed more than 80 per cent of people in the Ballina and Byron shires are opposed to killing sharks .
The data that I 've seen for the last three years whether it 's from WA , whether it 's from Sydney or whether it 's in Cape Town or whether it 's in Ballina have all said , 'do n't kill the sharks ' . Lecturer in Public Policy at the University of Sydney Christopher Neff
`` The data that I 've seen for the last three years whether it 's from WA , whether it 's from Sydney or whether it 's in Cape Town or whether it 's in Ballina have all said , 'do n't kill the sharks ' , '' Dr Neff said .
`` The only people who are talking about killing the sharks usually , is the political class .
`` The public is sophisticated and the public generally gets it , that there are better alternatives that will make them safer . ''
Ballina Mayor David Wright said the community is hoping the summit produces some concrete recommendations .
`` We 've had the committees , there is an Upper House committee that is looking at this as well but this is all the scientists , '' Mr Wright said .
The scientists attending are from Australia , South Africa , Hawaii and North America where great white sharks are prominent .
`` So if they ca n't come up with solutions with the top people there , there wo n't be solutions , '' they said .
Minister for Primary Industries Niall Blair said the Government would leave `` no stone unturned to make sure we look at new and innovative ways to protect our beaches . ''
Premier Mike Baird has previously said shark nets should be considered along the NSW north coast .
However , Mr Baird said they would prefer deterrents that do not require nets .

Getty Syrian refugees arrive in Rome
Asylum applications look set to surpass the figure of 84,000 made last year . More than 60,000 requests were made up to July this year , the second highest of any country within the European Union , only Germany has received more . The figures were revealed by Giorgio Alleva , the president of ISTAT ( The National Institute for Statistics ) which supplies official figures and data for the government , during a hearing of the Parliamentary Commission .

The real novelty of recent years is the growing number of young immigrants and second-generation immigrants who become Italian ISTAT President Giorgio Alleva
Alluvia said : “ The real novelty of recent years is the growing number of young immigrants and second-generation immigrants who become Italian . “ Those who obtain citizenship from their parents and those who were born in our country and at the age of eighteen choose to have Italian citizenship , increased from about 10,000 in 2011 to over 66,000 in 2015. ” On January , 1 2016 the number of official ‘ foreigners ' in the southern European country stood at 5,026,153 , according to ISTAT , a rise of 12,000 compared to 2014 .

The figure represents 8.3 percent of Italy 's total population which compares to France 's 6.6 percent and Germany with 9.3 percent . Of those five million people , four million - 70 percent - come from outside the EU but have a regular residence permit . According to Alleva , the number of foreigners living in the country increased by five times since 1998 , which is the largest growth of any country in Europe .

Barack Obama issued a decree `` demanding that every public school now allow grown men and boys into the little girls ' bathroom . ''
Nothing gives the president `` power to be the bathroom police , '' U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz declared at the Republican Party of Texas convention as they took fierce issue with an Obama administration letter to public schools distributed the day before .
In the May 13 , 2016 , letter , federal agencies cited a decades-old federal law barring discrimination in educational settings as the basis for telling school superintendents nationally to let transgender students use the bathroom that corresponds with their gender identity .
Cruz , fresh off their bid for president , told delegates : `` The president issued a decree to every public school in America demanding that they change their bathroom policies , demanding that every public school now allow grown men and boys into little girls ' bathrooms . We have entered the world of politically correct lunacy . ''
Did Cruz accurately sum up the Obama directive ?
To our emailed request for the basis of Cruz 's statement , Cruz spokesperson Phil Novack said only : `` By the very text of the directive you linked , anyone in a public school , whether they are students or adults ( which includes adult 18-year old students ) , would be able to enter any restroom . '' Novack also accurately noted the guidance also applies to colleges that accept federal aid .
Obama administration letter
We asked a Department of Education spokesperson , Dorie Nolt , if the directive , particularly the portion on access to restrooms and locker rooms , would also apply to adults in schools .
By email , Nolt replied : `` Our guidance is related to students . ''
For our part , we noticed that the letter in question does n't tell schools to let men into girls ' restrooms ; it does n't say anything about adults in public schools . And its language about students is focused on transgender boys and girls whose gender identity does n't match their sex assignment at birth .
The eight-page letter from the U.S. departments of Justice and Education tells school districts to be compliant with Title IX protections against sex discrimination by allowing students to use the bathrooms and locker rooms of the gender they identify with .
The letter , also affecting says the agencies are offering `` significant guidance '' on policies related to transgender students in relation to athletics , housing and overnight accommodations and education records , among areas .
In regard to restrooms and locker rooms , the letter states :
`` A school may provide separate facilities on the basis of sex , but must allow transgender students access to such facilities consistent with their gender identity . A school may not require transgender students to use facilities inconsistent with their gender identity or to use individual-user facilities when other students are not required to do so . A school may , however , make individual-user options available to all students who voluntarily seek additional privacy . ''
Defining transgender
And what qualifies as `` transgender '' ? Here 's how the Obama administration letter defines it : `` Transgender describes those individuals whose gender identity is different from the sex they were assigned at birth . A transgender male is someone who identifies as male but was assigned the sex of female at birth ; a transgender female is someone who identifies as female but was assigned the sex of male at birth . '' The letter defines gender identity as `` an individual 's internal sense of gender . A person 's gender identity may be different from or the same as the person 's sex assigned at birth . ''
The National Center for Transgender Equality , a social justice advocacy organization for transgender people , says a transgender individual is a person whose gender identity , expression or behavior is different from those typically associated with their assigned sex at birth . Otherwise , the American Psychological Association defines transgender as `` an umbrella term for persons whose gender identity , gender expression or behavior does not conform to that typically associated with the sex to which they were assigned at birth . ''
Then again , there are professionals who dispute such definitions . For instance , Paul McHugh , a psychiatrist formerly at Johns Hopkins University , said in a June 12 , 2014 , Wall Street Journal commentary : `` At the heart of the problem is confusion over the nature of the transgendered . ‘ Sex change ' is biologically impossible , '' McHugh said . `` People who undergo sex-reassignment surgery do not change from men to women or vice versa . Rather , they become feminized men or masculinized women . Claiming that this is civil-rights matter and encouraging surgical intervention is in reality to collaborate with and promote a mental disorder . ''
Bathroom debate
Debate over whether a transgender person should use the bathroom aligning with their or their gender identity or gender assigned at birth picked up steam after North Carolina lawmakers in March 2016 passed a measure into law requiring people to use the bathroom corresponding with the gender on their birth certificate in public multiple-occupancy bathrooms and changing facilities .
In Texas in April 2016 , the superintendent of the Fort Worth Independent School District , Kent Scribner , approved bathroom policy guidelines Scribner described as a call to meet the needs of the district 's transgender students . Then on May 9 , 2016 , Lt. Gov Dan Patrick called for the superintendent to resign . Less than a week later , the Education and Justice departments sent their letter , which was met with a lawsuit , filed May 25 , 2016 , against the administration by Texas and 10 other states .
Our ruling
Cruz said Obama issued a decree `` demanding that every public school now allow grown men and boys into the little girls ' bathroom . ''
Federal agencies told schools to let transgender students use the restrooms corresponding to their gender identity .
Yet that letter of guidance says nothing about grown men or other adults , leaving this claim with just an element of truth provided you believe , as Cruz apparently does , that a transgender person born a boy remains a boy .
We rate this statement Mostly False .
MOSTLY FALSE – The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression .

Major corporations have helped turn the Emerald City into an economic titan , while Vancouver incomes are among Canada 's lowest . Credit : Shutterstock
Before Trevor Barnes began a research project comparing the economies of Seattle and Vancouver , they were “ a bit snooty ” about the city he 's called home since 1983 .
“ I thought Vancouver was by far the superior city , and it may well be in terms of environment , but not in terms of economy , ” said Barnes , a professor at the University of British Columbia who studies economic geography .
“ We are just pathetic in relation to Seattle . ”
To observers of Vancouver 's economy , the city 's economic engine increasingly appears to be stuck in neutral . Despite a growing tech sector , renewed activity in film and TV production and stalwart sectors like financial services , incomes continue to lag behind those in other Canadian cities and have even fallen in the past few years compared with other metropolitan areas .
“ It 's not a new problem , but perhaps it 's gotten more salient because of the rise in housing prices , ” said Jock Finlayson , an economist and chief policy officer at the Business Council of British Columbia .
They noted B.C . 's economy has n't done that badly in recovering from the recession , “ but people in the Lower Mainland really feel they 're falling behind with the cost of living and housing with the incomes they can earn. ” In 2008 , Metro Vancouver 's median income ranked 20th out of 28 census metropolitan areas , above Toronto and Montreal . By 2012 , those cities had surpassed Vancouver , which had fallen to 24th place .
Andy Yan , a planner at Bing Thom Architects , has published data isolating median incomes by age and education level . By that measure , Metro Vancouver residents aged 25 to 55 who hold bachelor 's degrees make the lowest median incomes in the country , at just $ 41,981 . At $ 49,088 , residents with master 's or doctorate degrees also make the lowest median incomes compared with their counterparts across the country .
Those relatively low incomes contrast sharply with Vancouver 's expensive real estate . With homes priced above $ 1 million risingdramatically , CIBC World Markets recently warned the phenomenon is “ freezing ” mid-level homeowners in place and shutting out first-time buyers .
But it 's not just residential real estate that 's sky-high : office and commercial property values have also raised the cost of doing business in the city .
“ What happens when we 're such an expensive region to be in , not only in the United States but across Canada ? ” Yan asked .
The Seattle advantage
Yan observed that in the early 1990s , Vancouver 's income and housing balance was slightly better than Seattle 's . It 's a much different story today .
Both cities started out as West Coast resource towns dominated by forestry . Barnes said the size and importance of that sector began to shrink dramatically through the 1980s and 1990s . At the same time , cities were becoming increasingly important as globalization took hold .
“ The new economy that emerges [ in Vancouver ] is based on relatively small firms , but it 's never enough to sustain what 's going on , ” Barnes said . “ The Vancouver economy is buoyed up by its real estate market . Vancouver becomes increasingly a resort city within this larger global urban structure . ”
Seattle had something Vancouver did n't : Boeing ( Nasdaq : BA ) . The aviation and aerospace company , founded in Seattle in 1916 by a man who got their start in the forestry business , would provide a “ propulsive ” force for engineering and computers . Today , Seattle is home to several of the world 's largest corporations , including Microsoft ( Nasdaq : MSFT ) , Starbucks ( Nasdaq : SBUX ) , Amazon ( Nasdaq : AMZN ) and Costco ( Nasdaq : COST ) .
When it comes to creating its “ new economy , ” Barnes said Vancouver has had a few moments , such as the growth of the video game and film industry in the 1990s . But those sectors later shrank as other regions attracted business through competitive tax credits .
Talent glut , but more needed
Despite Vancouver 's high cost of living , young people and immigrants keep coming here . That 's both good and bad for the city , Finlayson said .
“ Living here is the primary goal rather than finding employment . You have a situation where tech companies and law firms … can often pay people less to do similar work . ”
Metro Vancouver residents have a relatively high level of education compared to the rest of the country . Andy Yan/Bing Thom Architects .
That does n't mean companies are profiting from paying people less , because just like residents , businesses pay a high cost to operate in Vancouver , Finlayson said . Land costs are around the same level as in New York or Hong Kong – but unlike those cities , Vancouver does n't come close to being a first-tier business city .
“ It 's the main commercial centre for B.C . and home to Canada 's largest port and that 's about it , ” Finlayson said .
While Metro Vancouver has benefited from people coming from abroad and other parts of Canada , Finlayson warned that the income and cost of living disparity could deter people from moving here . They noted that while B.C . has historically attracted more immigrants than Alberta , that trend has recently begun to reverse .
Yan thinks the rising cost of land and low incomes are a potent combination that could cause problems down the road .
“ It becomes about the cost of starting up a company or the cost of really trying to develop the next big idea , compared to other jurisdictions , whether they 're in other parts of Canada or the U.S . ”
Finlayson would like politicians across the region to focus on what they can do to encourage more business activity , including being more open to industrial and resource sectors . Many of the largest companies headquartered in Vancouver are mining companies , they said .
For Yan , education is key . It 's important that B.C . continues to invest in the province 's public education system , they said , so that young people have the skills needed to take advantage of future economic opportunities .
While the city 's economy was once dominated by resource industries , growing and tending “ human capital ” might be Vancouver 's best bet for the future .
“ The new economy industries , that 's what they want , their sole resource is the talent of their employees , ” Barnes said . “ If there 's a way of tapping into that talent , that would signal success . ”

Despite the rocky finances of the parent company of the lead contractor on key section of I-69 through Bloomington , the state says it has not changed its plans to pay I-69 Development Partners in advance to finish construction .
Isolux Corsan , the Spanish parent company of the lead contractor , has started the process to avoid insolvency , Reuters reported . Isolux could potentially be forced to start the bankruptcy process if it does n't find funds in four months .
That could mean little for the I-69 project , even if the company does go bankrupt , said Paul Lewis , vice president of policy and finance for the Eno Center for Transportation , a nonpartisan think tank .
In order to fund section five — a 21-mile stretch from Bloomington to Martinsville — the state chose to use a public-private partnership between I-69 Development Partners and the Indiana Finance Authority . Using a partnership allows the I-69 group to access tax-free bonds , and those bonds do n't show up in the state 's debt portfolio . The state will pay I-69 Development Partners to maintain the road for the next 35 years .

Lewis said public-private partnerships also shift most of the risk to the private investors .
`` If you 're the public sector and you 've shifted a bunch of risks and the private sector has n't gotten their act together and they go bankrupt , it 's in some ways no skin off your back , '' Lewis said . `` The public sector still owns the roadway , and now they get a brand-new asset that they did n't have to pay for — or that they paid a lot less for . And it was n't the public sector that got burned on it ; it was the private entity that did . ''
Lewis said due to the public-private partnership , even if Isolux goes bankrupt , I-69 Development Partners would be held responsible — unless the state decides to void the contract .
`` Either case , the public sector is rarely getting the short end of the deal , '' Lewis said . `` It 's usually the private bondholders that invest in the project that get the shaft . ''
But the state is still impacted by the well-being of I-69 Development Partners ' lead contractor . The project has been delayed 18 months so far , with construction traffic snarling the main route through Bloomington and near Indiana University .
`` You 've got all of these ( citizens ) driving that stretch of the road wondering how many more years of this there are , '' said Rep. Matt Pierce , D-Bloomington , who has repeatedly spoken out about the delays .
In September , subcontractors stopped working after not receiving their paychecks . The issue was resolved , but the project was delayed again in February .
Christian Harper , a spokesperson for I-69 Development Partners , did not provide an explanation for those delays , nor did they return multiple phone calls about I-69 Development Project 's plan moving forward .

In September , the IFA and I-69 Development Partners signed a memorandum of understanding pushing back the completion date . If approved by I-69 Development Partners bondholders , the memorandum also would require the state to make a $ 28 million payment in advance to I-69 Development Partners in order to finish construction .
Stephanie McFarland , a spokesperson for IFA , said the terms of the memorandum have n't changed despite Isolux 's financial concerns . Dan Huge , public-finance director for Indiana Finance Authority , said in a statement that they were moving forward as planned on construction .
`` INDOT/IFA and the developer are currently in discussions regarding the developer 's design-build contractor , '' Huge said . `` Work continues on the road , and we will provide an update if any material changes occur related to the timeline of the project . ''
Pierce worried about the potential for even more delays , if the state decides to wait for Isolux to potentially file for bankruptcy .
`` So to me the big question for the IFA , '' Pierce said , `` is are they just pretty much waiting four months to see if this bankruptcy finally puts the stake in this company so they can move on and get a contract that can complete the work , because they think that will be the least litigious way to get out of a contract , or are they trying to find a way to make this work ?

It is too early to anoint this year 's Kentucky Wildcats as one of the best college basketball teams ever , but it is hard to deny that the team 's defense is unbelievable . One Louisville professor takes that belief to the next level—he thinks the NCAA should ban the “ smothering , corrupt ” defense that held their Cardinals to 50 points and a paltry 25.9 % shooting from the field .
Dr. Michael Cassaro , a professor emeritus at Louisville , wrote in to The Courier-Journal about how Kentucky 's defense may spell “ doom ” for college basketball .
I watched the Louisville-Kentucky game Saturday and came away with the perception that I had not witnessed basketball as I know it should be played . This is the only Kentucky game I saw this season . One team smothered its opponent , not randomly , but totally . My belief is that Kentucky 's coach has planned , through recruitment and coaching tactics , to build a program that smothers and bullies opponents rather than play basketball the way it should be played . Inevitably , this corruption of college basketball will doom the sport at the college level . No team wants to play that kind of program . I do n't understand how Kentucky 's players tolerate the loss of athletic play in their present up-and-down routine where true competition is never achieved . The NCAA should reject this corrupted play before other schools reject submitting their programs to participate .
Tell us how you really feel , Dr. Cassaro .

KADUNA , Nigeria ( Reuters ) - Workmen were attempting to finish electrical fittings and lay tiles at a new terminal in northern Nigeria 's Kaduna airport on Wednesday just hours before it takes over responsibility for handling passengers bound for the capital Abuja .
For six weeks starting on Wednesday night , flights will be diverted to Kaduna while Abuja airport is closed for runway repairs after airlines threatened to stop flying there .
The cutting of direct flights to Abuja , an important business hub as well as Nigeria 's political nerve center , raises economic and security concerns . Passengers will take the journey of around 160 km ( 100 miles ) to the capital on guarded buses , along a road where kidnappings have taken place in recent years .
A Reuters team saw workmen on scaffolding putting electrical fittings in place and fitting tiles in some parts of the Kaduna complex .
Electric cables and unused scaffolding lay outside the building and parts of the complex remained unpainted , but inside there was electricity to power the conveyor belts .
Despite the ongoing work , a flight carrying passengers on Ethiopian Airlines , the only international airline that has said it will use the alternative airport , arrived at the new terminal at 11.30 local time ( 1030 GMT ) , said a senior airport official .
“ Airport staff were very cooperative but I think the systems are not ready . The systems should be ready , ” said one passenger .
Bismarck Rewane , a leading Nigerian economist , has said the closure of the airport in Abuja , where the government and central bank are based , will have a “ catastrophic ” impact on Africa 's biggest economy .
It comes amid a downturn in the OPEC member which , reeling from low oil prices and militant attacks on oil facilities in its Niger Delta energy hub , saw its economy shrink 1.5 percent in 2016 - its first full-year contraction in 25 years .
Airlines including British Airways , Lufthansa and South African Airways have refused to fly into Kaduna due to security concerns .
The Reuters journalists saw police vehicles stationed at about 2 km intervals on the road between Abuja and Kaduna .
Kaduna airport has primarily been used for domestic flights , with Abuja airport handling 4,859 domestic flights in December 2015 - the last month for which figures were available - compared with the 171 that flew in or out of Kaduna .
Mayor Walsh to Conduct City-wide Audit of Every Street in Boston
Neighborhood representatives to assess every neighborhood , on the ground
Today , Mayor Martin J. Walsh announced NEW ( Neighborhood Engagement Walks ) Boston , a comprehensive audit of every street in every neighborhood across Boston . Starting September 15 , representatives from the Mayor 's Office of Neighborhood Services ( ONS ) will begin walking the 850 miles of city streets across Boston , in an effort to assess each neighborhood in great detail . The findings will be shared in a forward-facing story map , continuing the Mayor 's pledge for increased transparency and accountability in City government .
“ This is the first step in revitalizing our work with Neighborhood Services , ” said Mayor Walsh . “ Our ONS reps are outstanding , but I want them to know every inch of the area that they represent and the best way to do that is to get on the ground and in the weeds . By combining technology and grassroots engagement , we can – for the first time in our history – truly assess every piece of this City , to better serve the people in our neighborhoods . ”
ONS representatives will survey every part of their respective neighborhood , on the ground , and evaluating infrastructure challenges , identifying constituent concerns through conversations , and cataloging issues facing each neighborhood . The goal of this effort is to closely examine the City , allowing ONS representatives to understand every facet of their respective neighborhood while engaging with constituents on the ground and building relationships face-to-face .
“ Mayor Walsh has challenged each department to take a fresh look at the work that we do , and the best way to begin is to conduct a comprehensive evaluation , ” said Jerome Smith , Director of ONS . “ We always want to take a long view and find ways to better serve our constituents . By combing the City 's streets , and logging everything we find , we 're fulfilling the Mayor 's promise to increase efficiency while supporting greater transparency . ”
NEW Boston will be a cross-departmental effort , with ONS representatives working closely with the City 's Inspectional Services Department , Public Works Department , Transportation Department , and Parks Department , among others .
ONS representatives will be equipped with connected tablets and data will be gathered utilizing mobile technology through existing apps such as Citizens Connect and City Worker . This is another step forward in Mayor Walsh 's pledge to upgrade infrastructure through technology , enabling ONS and the City to respond to issues effectively and in real-time , with greater transparency and accountability . The data from NEW Boston will be compiled by Department of Innovation and Technology ( DoIT ) , and will be shared with the public through a web-based story map . The map will show the routes that have been covered , highlight the issues that ONS has identified , and display the progress of resolving each issue .
This audit will begin on September 15 , 2014 , with a goal of completion by the end of the year . At the close of this audit , each ONS representative will generate a neighborhood report outlining their findings , to be shared with the public and presented to neighborhood associations . The ONS representatives leading NEW Boston include :
Tripoli Libya 's armed forces gave militias 48 hours to withdraw from government installations in and around the capital that they occupied after last year 's uprising , while two groups announced they were disbanding after weekend protests against them .
The ultimatum issued late on Saturday by the military said authorities would use force if needed to back their mission , the state-run Libyan news agency LNA reported . The agency also said the Ansar Al Sharia brigade — linked by Libyan authorities to the attack on the US consulate in Libya — and the Abu Salim brigade in the city of Derna , east of Benghazi , announced they would disband “ in response to the demands of protesters calling for the dissolution of armed groups . ”
The authorities also decided to put in place an “ operations room ” in Benghazi bringing together the army , forces of the interior ministry and defence ministry brigades comprising former rebels .
And they called on the army to impose its authority by putting its own officers at the head of brigades born out of the 2011 revolt , which escalated into civil war and toppled the Gaddafi regime .
The new authorities have not been able to disband these civilians turned fighters though many of their units have joined the ministry of interior or ministry of defence .
The decree , in tandem with mass protests against militias in Benghazi , the country 's second largest city , reflect a push by Libyan authorities to boost security after last year 's ouster and killing of long-time leader Muammar Gaddafi created a security vacuum that has yet to be filled .
Tensions in Benghazi have risen since the September 11 attack on the US consulate and a second site that left US Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other people dead . Prime Minister-elect Mustafa Abu Shaghour said September 20 that eight Libyan nationals were arrested in connection with the consulate assault and Ansar Al Sharia was one of the groups thought to be involved .
Key Role
Eleven people were killed during fighting in Benghazi as unarmed protesters sought to drive the Ansar Al Sharia from its base there . More than 70 were injured in the clashes , LNA said , citing health officials . In a separate report , the agency said five corpses of National Army members were found in Benghazi .
Many of the militias , which played a key role in the 2011 uprising , took over military bases . Some also took over government installations such as Tripoli 's airport . Authorities have been able to regain control of the airport , though other facilities including some hospitals are guarded by militias .

Millions of users around the world use Onavo 's mobile apps to take the worry out of using smartphones and tablets .
Onavo is a privately-held company based in Palo Alto , CA with backing from Sequoia Capital , Magma Venture Partners , Horizons Ventures and Motorola Mobility Ventures .
Techcrunch has mentioned that Onavo will give facebook a much deeper tech bench to measure how its mobile services are working .
Facebook has been focusing on building up its mobile business , which is seeing the most growth and is the platform that most users in developing markets are turning to first when signing up for and using the social networking service . Onavo will give the company a much deeper tech bench to measure how its mobile services are working . It will also be a very strong play to attract more mobile developers to Facebook overall . Sidenote : Facebook was reportedly interested in buying Waze , the social/mobile mapping company that eventually got sold to Google . One of the sticking points of that deal ( reportedly ) was that Facebook wanted all of Waze in Menlo Park 's HQ . Today 's deal shows that Facebook clearly is n't adverse to having a presence in the country after all .
“ Onavo will be an exciting addition to Facebook , ” a Facebook spokesperson told AllThingsD . “ We expect Onavo 's data compression technology to play a central role in our mission to connect more people to the internet , and their analytic tools will help us provide better , more efficient mobile products . ”
Alexander Rossi to Pilot No . 98 NAPA AUTO PARTS Honda For Select 2017 Events
NAPA AUTO PARTS and Alexander Rossi drove into racing history by capturing the twin-checkers at the 100th Running of the Indianapolis 500 , and the pair will again join with Andretti Autosport in 2017 . The seven-race , co-primary sponsorship will see the reigning Indy 500 champion take the wheel of Andretti 's No . 98 NAPA AUTO PARTS Honda starting at the 2017 Verizon IndyCar Series season opener in St. Petersburg , Florida . Rossi will then carry NAPA Know How for races in Long Beach , Indianapolis , Road America , Watkins Glen and Sonoma .
“ We are pleased to announce our continued partnership with one of the more iconic brands in all motorsports , the Andretti brand ” stated NAPA President , Dan Askey . “ We are equally excited to partner with one of the rising stars in the sport in Alexander Rossi and proud to have Alexander representing NAPA both on and off the track . We were fortunate to come on board in May of 2016 becoming a part of history as we rode along with Alexander capturing the 100th Running of the Indianapolis 500 . Andretti Autosport remains one of the elite teams in the IndyCar Series and we look forward to what 2017 holds . ”
The blue and yellow NAPA livery first entered the Andretti stable in May 2016 , just in time to claim victory at the historic 100th Running of the Indianapolis 500 . Rossi then carried the NAPA branding on to Detroit 's double header weekend . The Indy 500 winning car and livery of Rossi can be seen on display at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway Hall of Fame Museum .
“ NAPA is a storied , American brand and I could n't be more proud to announce our partnership is continuing , ” said Andretti Autosport CEO Michael Andretti . “ We were pleased to have previously announced that Alexander will be returning for the full season , and now to be able to confirm that NAPA is back on board – what a great way for us to start 2017 . Our relationship with NAPA came together quickly during our Month of May program last year , and it was n't long before the partnership was written into history books . We ca n't wait to add a few more pages to history together . ”
`` Confirming NAPA AUTO PARTS is the perfect way for us to start off 2017 , ” said Rossi , 25 . “ NAPA is one of the most recognized brands in the U.S. , and with over 6,000 stores , they touch every corner of our nation . In 2016 , we had historic success together in the Verizon IndyCar Series , however there is still much more to accomplish . I 'm proud to have NAPA back on board the No . 98 and am motivated to carry our momentum together through 2017 . ”
Rossi joins teammates Ryan Hunter-Reay ( No . 28 DHL Honda ) , Marco Andretti ( No . 27 hhgregg Honda ) and Takuma Sato ( No . 26 Honda ) as the battle for the 2017 Verizon IndyCar Series championship begins with the Firestone Grand Prix of St. Petersburg . The season-opener event will be featured via live broadcast March 12 at noon ET on ABC .
In today 's actual international news intersecting with the metaverse , Greece 's former finance minister , Yanis Varoufakis , is at the heart of the current economic crisis which will determine the future of the Greek and EU economy :
Mr. Varoufakis , an academic with no political experience before they joined the leftist Tsipras government , had consistently argued that Greece desperately needed debt relief more than anything else . While that view was shared by many economists , they quickly became a lightning rod among Greece 's creditors for their aggressive negotiating style and heated language . Before the referendum vote , they had publicly accused the creditors of “ terrorism ” against their country .
... which is interesting , because just a few years ago , Mr. Varoufakis was at the heart of helping Valve determine the price of its virtual hats :
Via the common distribution platform of Steam , Valve players can trade in game items known as “ hats ” — used to differentiate player avatars from each other — for objects in other games , or even for downloaded games that have been purchased but not yet played . But it 's not always clear how to value items from different games , or what would happen if , say , Team Fortress hat-makers flood the market with an overabundance of supply .
Somewhat ironically , I 'm told by an insider that Valve 's relationship with Varoufakis was about as fractious as it was with the EU . In any case , the departure of a virtual goods economist happens as more and more Greeks flee to a virtual currency :
'Breaking Bad ' Fans Get Their Fix In Spanish
Enlarge this image toggle caption Manuel Rodriguez/UniMás Manuel Rodriguez/UniMás
How do you remake the award-winning AMC series Breaking Bad in Spanish ?
Well , all you need — as the show 's chemistry teacher-turned-drug dealer , Walter White , might say — is `` a little tweak of chemistry . ''
Turn Walter White into Walter Blanco . For the show 's theme music , swap out bongos for a guitar and an accordion . And change the scenery from Albuquerque , N.M. , to Bogotá , Colombia .
Univision YouTube
For the most part , though , producers of UniMás ' Metástasis used the if-it-ain't-broke method for their Spanish-language remake , which re-creates all 62 episodes with much of the original dialogue translated almost word for word .
It took Metástasis about three months to blow through Breaking Bad 's five seasons with new episodes airing almost daily , telenovela-style , since June . The series finale is set to air Thursday night , almost a year after Breaking Bad ended its run .
Enlarge this image toggle caption Manuel Rodriguez/UniMás Manuel Rodriguez/UniMás
Like the English-language version , Metástasis begins with the midlife crisis of Walter Blanco , played by Colombian actor Diego Trujillo .
`` He starts with their 50th birthday , underestimated in their work . He 's got a sick son . He 's expecting a baby they never planned . And then suddenly they find out he 's got cancer , '' Trujillo explains . `` I 've always worked in television , doing soap operas here in Colombia . And the characters I 've played are always predictable . But the character of Walter White is so complex . ''
Walter 's cancer diagnosis acts as a wake-up call that eventually leads them to cooking crystal meth with a former student , José Miguel Rosas . ( Breaking Bad fans , that should translate as `` Jesse Pinkman . '' )
Roberto Urbina , who plays José , says Metástasis changes some details to make the story more believable in Latin America . For instance , Walter teaches at a private — not public — school , and they and José cook meth inside an old school bus instead of an RV , which would be harder to find in Colombia . Setting the show in Bogotá rather than Albuquerque had other implications on the storyline .
`` The drug dealing aspect of it had to be very carefully thought out because Colombia is a country that has a history of drug dealing , '' Urbina says . `` So people there , in our reality , we 're very touchy when it comes to that subject . ''

Drug dealing is a major plot point in the series , but its themes about morality and family are what hooked viewers like Laura Martínez , a Spanish-language media critic and editor for CNET en Español . Martínez says they were skeptical when they heard about Metástasis .
`` My first reaction was , 'This is ridiculous ! I do n't need a Hispanic Breaking Bad ; we already have a regular Breaking Bad , ' `` they explain .
But after watching the show , Martínez says she 's changed their mind .
`` It is not the first time we adapted a series in Latin America . But I think it is the first time that it 's done with such care , '' they say .
The remake 's production values also impressed Brian Delgado , a high school senior in Los Angeles who 's been following Metástasis since it debuted in June . They say he 's seen Breaking Bad five times and even got their parents , who grew up in Mexico , to start binge-watching with them — although they were n't accustomed to waiting months for the last episodes to air .
`` Once they finished the first half of the Season 5 [ of Breaking Bad ] , it was hell for them ! Because they were so used to watching telenovelas , '' Delgado says .
Unlike Breaking Bad , Metástasis follows the Spanish-language soap opera tradition of airing several times a week . But Delgado 's parents prefer the original version of Breaking Bad when it 's dubbed in Spanish . Delgado says there is no wrong choice .
`` Either way — Breaking Bad or Metástasis — I think you 're in for a treat , '' they say .
In February , AMC will treat Breaking Bad fans to a spinoff series about Walter White 's lawyer , Saul Goodman , called Better Call Saul -- though Metástasis viewers better call them Saúl Bueno .

WASHINGTON — The Army plans to support a National Day of Prayer event closely associated with an evangelical Christian organization despite a protest from a group that wants to crack down on what it calls fundamentalist Christian domination of the U.S. military .
In a letter Thursday to Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel , Mikey Weinstein , president of the Military Religious Freedom Foundation , demanded the Defense Department withdraw support from a May 1 Capitol Hill prayer event . It is being organized in part by the National Day of Prayer Task Force , a non-profit evangelical group chaired by Shirley Dobson , wife of evangelist James Dobson .
Army officials on Friday said there were no plans to back out of the event . The Army still intends to send a chaplain and the Military District Washington will contribute a color guard , a vocalist and a military band .
Weinstein told Hagel they had no issue with the non-sectarian National Day of Prayer itself as established by President Harry Truman , but said the NDP Task Force had taken over the event “ to promote their rapaciously exclusivist religion as the quasi-official religion of the nation . ”

Riyadh : A new law in Saudi Arabia seeks to ban `` tempting eyes '' of women in yet another example of female oppression in the country , according to mirror.co.uk .
The law reportedly states that women with alluring eyes will have to wear a full veil . This law has been strongly criticised on social media .
Sheikh Motlab al Nabet , spokesperson of the Saudi Arabian Committee for the Promotion of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice , reportedly said they `` had the right '' to force women to cover their face .
`` The men of the committee will interfere to force women to cover their eyes , especially the tempting ones . We have the right to do so , '' the metro.co.uk quoted them as saying .
Many commentators wondered how the word 'tempting ' would be applied . One commentator suggested it referred to `` uncovered eyes with a nice shape and makeup '' .
`` Or even without makeup , if they are beautiful , the woman will be in trouble , '' they added .
Prince Naif , who is set to succeed their father King Abdullah , suggested that any Muslim should support the Committee 's new law . Many had hoped that their ascension to the Saudi throne would bring an end to this kind of draconian oppression , but unfortunately they look as intolerant as their father .
`` It should be supported because it is a pillar of Islam . If you are a Muslim , you should support the committee , '' the report quoted them as saying .
President Donald Trump noted that other countries , unlike the United States , set drug prices and pay less than half of what the United States pays for the same treatments . | Getty Trump renews attacks on high drug prices The president reiterates their desire to get the cost of prescription drugs ‘ way down , ' claiming ‘ the world is taking advantage of us . '
President Donald Trump took two swings at drugmakers over the high cost of medicines on Monday , bringing attention back to an administration priority that they have largely ignored for the past few months .
Trump reiterated their desire to get the cost of prescription drugs `` way down , '' claiming during a Rose Garden press conference that `` the world is taking advantage of us . '' Before a Cabinet meeting earlier in the day , Trump accused drug companies of `` getting away with murder , '' repeating an attack line they first used shortly before taking office .

Trump noted that other countries , unlike the United States , set drug prices and pay less than half of what the United States pays for the same treatments . Trump said they want to bring U.S. prices down to what other countries are paying , `` or at least close '' to that amount , and let those countries pay more for drugs .
Their remarks echo claims , largely discredited by researchers , that U.S. drug prices are high because other countries pay less for medicines and do n't contribute as much toward research and development .
It 's unclear whether Trump 's renewed criticism of the drug industry signals any forthcoming action . Even though they have repeatedly lashed out at drugmakers , there 's been little indication they will crack down on prices .
A leaked draft of a still-pending executive order on drug prices this summer was favorable to the industry . The White House has also abandoned key pledges to allow Medicare to negotiate drug prices and expand importation of cheaper medicines from overseas . The administration has also appointed industry insiders to key posts .
Trump tied their harsh comments on drug prices to their broader criticism of Obamacare and their desire to remake the country 's health care system . However , neither the White House nor Congress ever put forward drug pricing reform as part of efforts to dismantle the Affordable Care Act , though Trump sometimes suggested they should be linked .

Trump also attacked the drug industry for contributing `` massive amounts of money '' to politicians and campaigns . They suggested that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell , who was standing beside them in the Rose Garden , may receive pharmaceutical industry donations .
Trump said they do n't need or want industry money , but they also benefited from the sector on the campaign trial and after their election . For instance , U.S. drug giant Pfizer made a $ 1 million contribution to Trump 's inaugural committee , and Amgen donated $ 500,000 , according to the Center for Public Integrity .
PHOENIX — An electric car company that is seeking to establish itself as a rival to Tesla will do so from a $ 700 million Arizona plant , Gov . Doug Ducey announced Tuesday .
At a press conference , Ducey said Lucid Motors would build a 500-acre plant in Casa Grande , south of Phoenix , that will employ 2,000 people by 2022 . Ducey said Lucid will also look to hire veterans .
Brian Barron with Lucid Motors — who served in the Navy — said the company wants to help veterans get back into the workforce .
Ducey praised their state 's low taxes and light regulations , saying that combination allows businesses to flourish .
“ When government takes a back seat to innovation , big things can happen , ” they said .
Sonora , Mexico Gov . Claudia Pavlovich Arellano said they and their staff worked with Ducey to convince Lucid to bring its plant to Arizona .
“ Lucid Motors will be located in Arizona and supplied , in part , by companies located in Sonora , ” they said .
Barron said the company originally identified 60 potential sites in 13 states for its plant .
“ We chose Arizona because you showed genuine interest in our company from the outset , because you negotiated in fairness and with understanding and because you continue working together with us from a partnership perspective , and not just a business perspective , ” they said .
The plant could be producing cars as soon as 2018 .
According to Reuters , the plant would open with the capability to produce 20,000 cars per year , but will eventually be ramped up to build 130,000 cars per year .
Rumors of the plant began floating around in October , when a report surfaced online that Lucid was considering a move to Arizona .

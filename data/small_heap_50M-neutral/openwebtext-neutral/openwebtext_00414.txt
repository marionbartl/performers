`` He should be honoured in some way for what he 's done . I know some people will say he 's only doing their job and is getting well paid anyway but we should , in some way , even if we only name a street after him , or even a park . We should do something and I hope we do .
I was quite pleased when Claudio was appointed , we needed someone with a bit of nous , more tactically aware . Nigel Pearson had Plan A but I do n't think there was a Plan B . With Claudio there 's a Plan B and Plan C .
We needed a foreign manager , they bring so much more to the game than English managers do . I was one of the few and it 's great to look at these pundits and think 'what do you really know ? ' .
Will we see Leicester carry on being successful ? Yes , this is a stepping stone . This is our time and for the next few years Leicester will be one of the clubs up there . I 'm not saying we 'll win it every year but we 'll be up there challenging .
It all turned for us when we got relegated to League One . I remember that day at Stoke ( after a 0-0 draw ) in the car park , people in floods of tears and arguments going on between the fans . Being relegated united the club and it was one of the greatest seasons .

Phillip is a die-hard Trump fan , and they mean serious business when they say “ stay off my lawn ! ”
According to WRTV News , the Indiana man claims he 's been targeted by those who oppose the Republican presidential candidate . Their outward signs of protest include people trying to steal their lawn signs twice in the past month .
They recalled the first attempt :
“ I looked out my front door and the sign was lying about four feet over , and it was crumpled up pretty good . ”
In a bid to give the would-be thieves a healthy dose of karma , they booby-trapped their front lawn .
ABC News reports that Phillip 's lawn is now adorned with fishing wire , string painted green to match the grass and a camouflaged camera in a nearby tree .
Their trap seemed to work , catching an unnamed woman on camera as they tripped over the fishing wire during their attempt to steal their signs .

And they say that bringing justice to sign stealers this election season is a non-partisan issue :
“ Whether it 's a Bernie or Hillary or a Trump sign , you might disagree with whatever the politics are , but it 's not yours . Leave it alone . ”
Local police have received Phillip 's video of the attempted theft , with no word yet on if they 'll investigate or whether Phillip will press charges .
I 'm not going to say ‘ I told you so ' , but I will point out that I detailed out a Mann Vs. Machine update coming about a month ago . We 've seen clues in-game , in promo videos and even deep in updated files . In the last twenty four hours the next chapter of the Mann Vs. Machine Alternate Reality Game has unfolded , and what a ride it 's been . Secret codes , finally a use for the capacitors , and many , many high fives .
SATURDAY AUGUST 11TH , 2012 UPDATE
A small update came early Saturday , and most users just accepted that it was a tweak to the new Kong King map introduced in the previous day 's update . But some did n't settle—not when there is science to do . A subset of TF2 players , myself proudly included , rarely accept what Valve gives us at face value . It was quickly figured out that there was more to this little update than a quick map fix . Some new information was added to the item schema , the code that defines pretty much everything in TF2 , in the form of hashes for each of the nine classes . Computer science ! Even more exciting , the Barely Melted Capacitors that had been sitting unused in players ' backpacks since the Pyromania ARG were now equipable by all classes in the miscellaneous slots . A few custom web pages and some great threads on Reddit and Google Docs served as grand central for communication for the players actively participating in the ARG .
^5S AS FAR AS THE EYE CAN SEE
Equipping the capacitors at first did n't seem to do anything . TF2 went on as normal , but not for long . A player donning a capacitor happened to give a high five in-game and a message was generated . The message was in the form of a joke from the class of the high five recipients . Once this news hit the ARG players , they rallied on servers to narrow down what this was . It turned out that each player in TF2 when slapping hands with three of the nine classes would generate a joke . The three classes were different per player and the jokes were the same each time they were generated by the same class . The codes were collected in a public spreadsheet and there was even a submission form created for easy contribution . Hours went by and players gave high fives until their palms were raw . Each class ' jokes , when parsed out , slowly started to take the shape of different kinds of files . Five of the nine were image files containing QR codes that output Adult , Baboon , Goldfish , Goggles and Councilman . The Demoman 's code was a Zipped up text file that contained ASCII art of Apollo , and Sniper 's was a MIDI file of Morse Code for unicorn . Like a true engineer , the Engi code was over-complicated C++ code—including inside jokes about Valve not being able to count to three—outputting the word resistor .
THE SPY 'S CODE
Then there was the Spy 's code , which gave us a raw text URL . The URL pointed to a Zip file on TF2.com that contained a Keepass database—this was obvious by the .kdbx file extension . The database prompted for a password that went unknown for all of about fifteen minutes . By the time the players had their hands on the Keepass file , the other codes were pretty much figured out . It was clear to some—string together the numeric byte values of the other eight outputs for the password . Once unlocked there was a single entry titled HAXOR . There is a password of ‘ E pluribus unum ' that does n't seem to mean anything and an attachment of spy.png that held another QR code . A little more computer science later , spy.png XOR-ed with the other QR codes output a link to this :
ONE CRAFT TO RULE THEM ALL
This recipe for Revenge Alamo 'd is obviously a TF2 crafting recipe . It was approximately 3am Pacific/6am Eastern when the first ARG player crafted the items listed . The craft did n't actually produce anything ( my sources tell me it did n't consume the ingredients either ) instead it triggered a system-wide alert stating quite firmly not to go to http : //www.teamfortress.com/bloodbrothers/ . Go ahead , click it—who listens to in-game messages anyways ? The link takes players to a new TF2 comic ending this round of the ARG and introducing the third Mann brother 's plan to take over Mann Co .

Government moves on privacy law
Updated
The Federal Government has moved to introduce a legal right to privacy in the wake of Britain 's News of the World phone-hacking scandal .
A discussion paper will be released to the public today to canvass the prospect of a law dealing with serious invasions of privacy .
Home Affairs Minister Brendan O'Connor says privacy is a growing concern in Australia , partly because of the events in Britain , as well as other breaches such as the theft of the Sony PlayStation users ' personal details .
`` Right now there is no general right to privacy in Australia , and that means there 's no certainty for anyone wanting to sue for an invasion of their privacy , '' Mr O'Connor said .
`` The News of the World scandal and other recent mass breaches of privacy , both at home and abroad , have put the spotlight on whether there should be such a right . ''
They say the Government will eventually decide if it should legislate on the issue .
In 2008 the Australian Law Reform Commission made 295 recommendations , including that Australia bring in a privacy law .
`` It 's a timely debate to be had , we did always look to attend to those recommendations , '' Mr O'Connor said .
They say a media organisation should have to ensure that any breach of a person 's privacy was in the public interest .
`` I do n't mean the public has an interest in it for titillation purposes , for example there 's certain gossip which might be disclosed , '' they said .
`` I 'm talking about whether in fact it 's in the public interest for the freedom of expression to prevail over that other value , which is of course the right to privacy . ''
But Australia 's Privacy Commissioner Timothy Pilgram says the laws need to be changed .
`` They have been the subject of two years of consideration by the Law Reform Commission , so I think these issues are n't new to us all as a community , '' they said .
`` We 're now looking at mechanisms to recognise the changing environment we 're in and to consider updating the laws to meet the challenges . ''
Mr Pilgram says freedom of the press is an integral part of our society .
`` It 's welcoming that the Government will be putting out an issues paper so we can get all interested parties to comment on it , including the media , to make sure that as we go down this path we make sure we do n't erode the freedom of the press , '' they said .
`` At the end of the day it 's integral to our free democratic society to have a very vibrant media . ''
Opposition communications spokesperson Malcolm Turnbull says with new media there are privacy issues that need to be addressed , such as cyber-bullying and stalking .
But they say any discussion about legislation should not just echo the News of the World inquiries .
`` If we 're going to look at privacy we should look right across all media and have an honest debate how much privacy , '' they said .
`` [ What ] do we believe we are entitled to and to what extent should that limit the right of the media to free speech . ''
The UK hacking scandal has forced the resignations of senior executives at News Corporation and two of Britain 's top police officers , as well as fuelling opposition attacks on prime minister David Cameron 's judgment .
It has torn through News Corp chief Rupert Murdoch 's empire , causing it to axe the 168-year-old tabloid News of the World and leading to the resignation of two of their top aides , Rebekah Brooks and Les Hinton .
Mr Murdoch appeared before a parliamentary committee on Tuesday night , where they expressed their `` humble '' regrets but did not take personal responsibility for the crisis .

A male prostitution network was discovered among the ranks of Colombian police last month , and it appears to have deep impact on the whole society , according to recent public opinion polls .
According to Colombian media Colombia Reports , the scandal involves some prominent figures in Colombia , namely a deputy minister and police chief who had to resign in February . Apparently , the scandal eroded already low approval ratings for Colombian police among the society in general .
The network in question , called , quite ironically , `` The Fellowship of the Ring '' , was run by senior police officials and operated within the police academy between 2004 and 2008 . In a nutshell , the network gave access to sexual services from male police cadets to officers and members of congress , who paid with cars , gifts and large sums of money .
The network was initially discovered in 2014 by a female cadet Maritza Zapata , found dead in 2006 . While their death was first labeled a suicide , their family is convinced that it was their discovery that got them killed .
However , the network came to light again in 2015 , when a prominent radio journalist Vicky Dávila started airing testimonies from police cadets , revealing stories about sexual harassment from Colombian police 's senior members , including its chief , Rodolfo Palomino .
© REUTERS / Steve Marcus Porn Company Offers Miss Colombia $ 1 Mln After Miss Universe Error
Despite Dávila discovering the unpleasant fact that their broadcasts led to their phones being illegally tapped , they continued on and aired a secretly made recording of a conversation about sexual experiences with then-senator Carlos Ferro . Ferro , who was deputy minister of the interior , had to resign after that .
The inspector general announced a formal investigation on the case , with police chief Rodolfo Palomino being the main suspect . Although their involvement in the prostitution network remains unproven so far , they had to resign from the police service as well .
R. Palomino : `` Just as the attorney general 's office has been investigating and thus far has not found evidence linking me ( to the scandal ) , I 'm sure the inspector general 's office wo n't find anything either . ''
Unfortunately , their investigation cost Dávila their job at La FM radio station . They are convinced that the president of Colombia Juan Manuel Santos had to put pressure on the parent company to force Dávila to abandon their job .
The scandal , however , brought in much deeper consequences . The Guardian cites a recent Gallup public opinion survey indicating that public approval of the police eroded from not too high point of 60 percent down to 46 percent in December 2015 , .
StarTrek.com , for our latest poll , asked Which Star Trek show had the best series finale ? The options , of course , were The Original Series , The Next Generation , Deep Space Nine , Voyager and Enterprise . More than 24,000 readers replied and the results are as follows :
The Next Generation ( 37 % )
Voyager ( 34 % )
Deep Space Nine ( 20 % )
Enterprise ( 5 % )
The Original Series ( 4 % )
Check out some comments from your fellow fans :
`` I thought 'All Good Things ' was the best because it felt like a finale but it left the door open for the future , and I 've always like it when Sci-Fi ends like that . '' -- Ben Stanton
`` How is Voyager nearing TNG in this poll ? 'Endgame ' is a fine piece of television , but is n't the intersecting time travel story just a rip off of 'All Good Things ' ? Yeah , sure , Red from Orange Is The New Black blows up the Borg Queen , that 's kinda cool . But the depressed air traffic controller from Breaking Bad shows Professor X how they almost destroyed life on earth before it even began ! Muh ! '' -- Mike Burton
`` Deep Space Nine did a great job of tying up loose ends . But The Next Generation was a true tribute to the show as a whole , with open-ended hope for the characters ' future . It gets my vote . '' -- Crystal Woehrle-Logan
`` 'All Good Things ' and 'What You Leave Behind ' were great . They took the characters that you had learned about during the 7 years of their shows and used them in totally believable ways to tell the perfect stories for those series ' finales . 'These Are The Voyages ' was a bad story , told badly . It did n't understand the shows own characters and it left me wishing everyone had blown up ( except Porthos ) . However , 'Endgame ' is the worst as far as I 'm concerned . Here you had a show that had so much potential from the start , but they failed to use it over the run of the entire series . It was badly written right from the start . But the finale was terrible because it had the potential to make up for all the downfalls of the series with what could have been the best ending of all time , and one I hoped that they would do .... Voyager does n't get home . '' -- Timothy Colin Davies
`` 'What You Leave Behind ' was the best because it provided the most amount of wrap up . You left the show kind of knowing what was next for each of the characters which gave a better sense of closure than the others . '' -- Austin Jae
`` I always loved Voyager but I think Deep Space Nine had the best finale ... because they started wrapping up character 's arcs before the last 2 hour episode . Voyager 's was rushed .... which always disappointed me because I so dearly loved that show ! And Enterprise , I loved it too .... but I 'll admit poor finale . '' -- William Archer
`` TNG hands down . '' -- James MacLovin Treanor
“ It was India which invented the bow & arrow ” my Dad blustered over the phone from Bombay , “ remember Arjuna 's skill at archery ? How they could concentrate till they saw nothing else but the target and shoot it with unerring precision time after time…. ” They had just returned from seeing the Hunger Games at their local multiplex , when my weekly Sunday phone call had sparked off this conversation ; with them insisting that the cross-bow was an Indian invention .
“ Uh ! Dad ” I protested , “ not everything in science fiction comes from Indian mythology…. ” I was , as usual , embarrassed by their well known theme of India shining and claiming ownership of emerging trends . Yet their comment gave me pause for thought . I began to wonder if they had a point ?
Cut to a few years back , when , on one of my annual trips to Bombay , the extended family had trooped off en masse to see Avatar in 3D at the brand-new IMAX theatre in Bombay . I sat next to my father enjoying their excitement as they leaned forward to perch precariously close to the edge of the seat , fascinated by the incredible images flashing across the cinema screen .
And as the scene with the Tree of Souls which has a neural link to the Na'vi uniting them all as one , unfolded , they gasped in surprise shaking their head ; explaining to me later that Ayurveda the Indian system of traditional medicine had a very similar concept of unity . That , all living creatures are linked to this planet and are one with Earth . The concept of blue people itself was familiar as many Indian Gods are depicted in similar fashion .
Ritesh : Lord Krishna is famously depicted in blue in all idols and paintings .
Flying chariots , Gods teleporting at will across dimensions , powerful weapons of war that could destroy entire armies , revolving discs & guided swords spewing fiery sparks which would return to their owners after hitting its target , illusions which could frighten without hurting , and the massive bow which only Rama could string to win the heart of the beautiful Sita… Hmmm ! I had seen these scenes countless times over the years .
Amar Chitra Katha ( Indian comic books ) took over where my grandmother left off , yet what chance did a teenager 's raging hormones stand against tight bodysuits , plunging necklines , fanatical crime fighting and passionate love stories . With the first Superman movie I was in love with caped crusaders – Spider-Man , Batman , Legion of Superheroes ( my personal favourite ) Green Lantern , Wonder Woman not to mention Tarzan & Phantom and much later Conan the Barbarian – I lived happily with them for a very long time .
And then I stumbled across the gaming world which is proud to borrow from Indian mythology . Take for example Asura 's Wrath an action video game released February 2012 . According to the game 's producer Kazuhiro Tsuchiya , “ Asura 's Wrath takes elements from Hindu mythology and blends them with science fiction . In the game , Asura is a demigod fighting to reclaim their daughter from the deities who kidnapped them and banished them from earth . ”
Or for that matter Xena the Warrior Princess ' trademark chakram which looks and acts very similar to the famed sudarshan chakra ( Lord Vishnu 's deadly weapon of choice – a golden discus which cuts through the target and returns to owner . )
VS .
Over the years I realised that Hollywood and the West have looked to Indian mythology for inspiration . But time has come full circle , with a brave new breed of Indian fantasy writers seeking to carry on the tradition of the ancient epics . Check out the brilliant Ramayana 3392 AD from New York based Liquid comics and the seductive Devi .
Ritesh : For me , the most vivid example is of me seeing the Matrix trilogy and wondering how much of the story relates to the religion of Jainism . The basic premise of the movies , of our life being an illusion , is something which Jainism talks about as well .
Do you agree ? Have you come across more examples of Western science fiction drawing from Indian mythology ? I 'd love to hear from you .

Last winter , Jim and Lisa Klunder took a look at the women 's soccer schedules at Grand Valley State and Spring Arbor and realized something amazing was possible with their daughters .
The national championships were in Pensacola , Fla. , for NCAA Division II and in Orange Beach , Ala. , for NAIA . That 's 27 miles apart .
`` When we found out Division II was going to be in Pensacola , we got out a map and said , 'Oh , my word . Could this even ever happen ? ' '' Lisa Klunder said .
In fact , it did . On Saturday , a parents ' dream came true as the Klunders watched both daughters win national titles within hours of each other .
Katie , a senior midfielder , started and played their final collegiate game for Grand Valley State , and the Lakers defeated Columbus State 2-0 in Pensacola .
From there , the couple hopped in their car to Orange Beach and watched nearly all of Spring Arbor 's 3-0 upset over top seed Lindsey Wilson College with Sarah , a sophomore midfielder , picking up a pair of assists .
Does it get any better than that for soccer parents ?
Katie Klunder
Sarah Klunder
`` No . It was amazing , '' said Lisa Klunder .
It was n't without its logistical obstacles . Once Grand Valley State 's noon game was done , they had to dash to make the Spring Arbor game .
`` We cheered , gave a quick hug to their senior daughter and I was literally changing my sweatshirts in the car , '' Klunder said with a laugh . `` Off with Grand Valley , on with Spring Arbor , change the baseball hats . It was all worth it . ''
In fact , it was soccer nirvana all week for the parents - albeit some nail biting . They drove out from Grandville early in the week as the NAIA format enabled them to watch Spring Arbor play four times beginning Tuesday . And they also got to see Grand Valley State 's semifinal win , too , on Thursday .
`` It was like back to back all week long . We were just going back and forth , '' Lisa Klunder said . `` It was a miracle the way the schedule worked out . ''
It was cool for the sisters , too . Sarah and the entire Spring Arbor team drove to see the Lakers play in the semifinals . That was emotional and uplifting for Katie , who saw their sister at halftime .
`` I could n't help but cry because I was so excited to see her , '' they said . `` We 've been best friends since we were little . ''
Sarah said having their parents see Katie 's final collegiate game was most important .
`` It was just great and super lucky to have them for both , '' they said . `` But really I think the most important thing was that it was my sister 's last year , and to have them see their win that was super special . ''
The sisters , who played one season together at Grandville Calvin Christian , did n't get to spend time with other each and the four never did get a quiet dinner together . But the day will live on .
`` As everyone was telling us , '' Katie said , `` it was a great day to be a Klunder . ''

Reserve deputy who shot Eric Harris brags in audio recording about connections to Tulsa police , amid controversy surrounding their training and field work
Embroiled in a legal battle over the sale of their insurance company , Robert Bates met a former colleague at a restaurant to discuss the court case over drinks .
Oklahoma deputy who shot Eric Harris dead pleads not guilty to manslaughter Read more
But Bates , the volunteer Tulsa County deputy now facing a manslaughter charge for shooting an unarmed suspect , did not know the 2012 conversation was being secretly recorded by their companion , Bryan Berman , the company 's new president .
During the exchange , Bates boasted of their connections in the sheriff 's department and the US attorney 's office and suggested they could make life miserable for the plaintiffs .
The audio recording , obtained by the Associated Press from the court file of a federal case that was later dismissed , reveals the corporate executive as a man who bragged about using their position in the sheriff 's office to help powerful friends and whose work as a reserve deputy added a spark to their life .
“ It 's kind of a thing that I need to go back to , to scare the shit out of me , to make me feel good about life , ” Bates said , chuckling , of their work as a volunteer deputy . “ I love that . That was just great . ”
On Monday , embattled Sheriff Stanley Glanz announced the resignation of their second-in-command , who , according to a 2009 internal investigation , had been aware that Bates was inadequately trained but pressured officers to look the other way . Undersheriff Tim Albin had been with the department since Glanz , a friend of Bates , first took office in 1989 .
Tulsa reserve deputy Robert Bates 's field operations were ' a little scary'– report Read more
Bates , who built and ran their own insurance company and eventually sold it for $ 6m , also described themselves as someone who does not fare well taking orders from others .
“ I do n't do well with that . I do n't do well with direction , ” Bates said on the recording . “ I never have , since the first grade . My first-grade teacher and I had a problem with it . I 've had problems throughout my life with it . ”
Bates 's attorney , Clark Brewster , confirmed the authenticity of the tape , but described it as a “ calculated ” attempt by Berman to get information from Bates that might help Berman 's company win the lawsuit .
“ This was two guys at a restaurant talking frankly about their experiences . And , unbeknownst to Mr Bates , Mr Berman apparently was surreptitiously taping him , ” Brewster said . “ It has nothing to do with the shooting . I can tell you that . ”
On the recording , Bates also suggests they did favors at the sheriff 's office for Brewster , their attorney in the federal case . When Berman asks Bates about their legal costs , Bates responded that they had not yet received a bill .
“ I have n't paid them yet , ” Bates said , then chuckled . “ Let 's say , I mean , they know I 've done some shit for them at the sheriff 's office for some of their clients . ”
Brewster , who has a prominent local law practice , said they have never asked Bates or anyone in the sheriff 's office to do favors for him . They said it 's possible Bates was trying to name drop in an effort to get the plaintiffs to drop the case .
“ I have no idea what that references , ” Brewster said .
Brewster declined to make Bates available for an interview and said their client was out of state . Bates owns a luxury home in a gated community in Vero Beach , Florida , and , according to their attorneys , planned to vacation in the Bahamas while awaiting their next court hearing in July . There are no travel restrictions on their bail .
Bates , who is white , has been charged with second-degree manslaughter in the 2 April shooting death of Eric Harris , an unarmed African American . Harris was the target of an undercover sting and was already on the ground , with two deputies on top of him , when Bates drew their weapon and fired a shot into Harris 's back . There is no indication that race played a role in the shooting .
The 73-year-old volunteer deputy , who has said they meant to draw their stun gun rather than their handgun , has pleaded not guilty .
As a young man , Bates had a short-lived career in law enforcement , serving as a patrolman for the Tulsa police department from 1964 to 1965 . It 's unclear why they stopped pursuing police work . The department has not explained why Bates left the force or responded to repeated requests for documents related to their departure .
Evidence of Bates 's unwillingness to take direction from superiors at the sheriff 's office also emerges in the 2009 investigative report obtained by the AP and other news organizations from attorneys for Harris 's family . It shows concerns within the Tulsa County sheriff 's office that the wealthy donor was conducting field operations for which they were not properly trained .
The investigation , which includes interviews with several high-ranking officers inside the sheriff 's department , found that Bates received special treatment and inadequate training . It quoted two deputies as saying they “ felt Bates 's field operations were a little scary ” .
It also concluded that when other officers raised complaints , they were told by superiors to keep quiet and were reminded of Bates 's generosity , which included donations of tens of thousands of dollars ' worth of vehicles and hi-tech equipment to the department .
In one case , Sergeant Randy Chapman told an internal investigator that Bates was eager to complete their field training program so that they could stop vehicles and do patrol functions on their own .
When Chapman learned Bates was stopping vehicles on their own without the proper training and confronted them about it , Bates responded : “ Well , I can do it , and if you do n't like it , you can talk to Tim Albin or Sheriff Glanz because I 'm going to do it , ” according to the investigative report .
Although Bates 's attorney maintains that Bates only rarely pulled drivers over , the Oklahoma highway patrol confirmed that Bates stopped an off-duty state trooper in 2013 on the Creek Turnpike , which is outside the jurisdiction of the sheriff 's office , an agency spokesperson , Lieutenant John Vincent said .
The Tulsa County sheriff 's office has declined to discuss the contents of the 2009 investigative report , which the office 's general counsel , Meredith Baker , said should not have been released publicly . After initially denying the report 's existence , authorities are now conducting an internal review to determine how it was leaked .
The sheriff 's office has failed to produce numerous documents requested by the AP , including documents supporting Bates 's training and any of their disciplinary records .
The Tulsa County district attorney , Steve Kunzweiler , has said they are highly concerned about the allegations in the report and that an outside agency should investigate the entire operation under Glanz . There is no indication that any outside law enforcement agency has launched an investigation .
Bates 's attorney , meanwhile , takes exception to the characterization of Bates as someone who contributed to the sheriff 's office so they could play cop , saying Bates donated to other causes without any fanfare .
“ He can be boisterous and assertive and those kinds of things , but he 's the guy who is a if somebody 's mother is sick in Idaho , they go and buys them a plane ticket , ” Brewster said . “ His generosity and heart for giving is huge . ”

OLD TRAFFORD THEATRE OF DREAMS
Our Old Trafford stadium , commonly known as `` The Theatre of Dreams , '' was originally opened on February 19 , 1910 with a capacity of approximately 80,000 . During the Second World War , Old Trafford was used by the military as a depot , and on March 11 , 1941 was heavily damaged by a German bombing raid . The stadium was rebuilt following the war and reopened on August 24 , 1949 . The addition of floodlighting , permitting evening matches , was completed in 1957 and a project to cover the stands with roofs was completed in 1959 . After a series of additions during the 1960s , 1970s and early 1980s , capacity at Old Trafford reached 56,385 in 1985 . The conversion of the stadium to an all-seater reduced capacity to approximately 44,000 by 1992 , the lowest in its history . Thereafter , we began to expand capacity throughout the stadium , bringing capacity to approximately 58,000 by 1996 , approximately 68,000 by 2000 , and approximately 76,000 in 2006 . Current capacity at Old Trafford is 75,454 .

It 's not easy to find quality news sources on subjects that matter to you . At the TechCrunch Disrupt SF Hackathon this weekend , a team of four strangers came together and using IBM Watson technology were able to hack together an intelligent newsreader .
“ We used IBM 's Alchemy News API to scrape high-quality news sources based on taxonomies , ” Ariel Weingarten , who made the presentation for the team , told TechCrunch . ( IBM bought Alchemy for just this kind of use case last March . )
Like many hackathon teams , the four guys , which included two teenagers , were forced to pare down their vision as the night went on . They also had to work around several problems , but they were able to build a usable tool before the night was over .
The team included Weingarten , Joel Ward and 14 year olds Daniel Bessonov and Patrick Li .
The Watson tech is so sophisticated , it can even watch your preferences and begin to use predictive analytics to offer you news and sources that would interest you .
“ So many web apps focus on making content available . Very few processes the content , directing you through the noise while giving you lots of signals , ” Weingarten explained .
But using the Watson API can be challenging and the developers had to work around a number of issues , especially with the short turn-around time of a hackathon .
Among the problems the team encountered was getting stuck trying to build the application in IBM 's Bluemix development environment . The developers felt with enough time , they could have overcome the issues they were having with Bluemix , but given the time constraints , they decided to move into GitHub where they were more comfortable .
They also found in early iterations , they were getting some strange results , but realized it was because the Alchemy API was using Tumblr as a news source . They said when they filtered out Tumblr , they got much more reliable results
They believe that the product could be expanded in a number of ways , such as building on Reddit to get real-time opinion or on top of Wikipedia to get historical information .
What 's more , they could see monetizing the idea by offering subscriptions to users , who are looking for more intelligent news distribution than they can get from from sources like Google News or Flipboard .
Given the time limits , and the level of sophistication of the Watson API , there were lots of parameters they ignored , but if they were to continue expanding this , they would have more time to understand the abilities of Watson and expand the product in a number of ways , increasing the sophistication of the news-finding algorithms .
This is a guest post from Kirstin Rower , the student panelist for tomorrow 's Feministing : Offline and Unfiltered event at UC Merced . Kirstin is a UC Merced sophomore and the president of University Women of Merced Network ( UWMN ) , the campus feminist organization . They intend to major in performing arts while simultaneously kicking some anti-choice butt . Find out more about Feministing 's upcoming California events here .
I do n't know about anyone else , but I did n't pick my college because of free condom handouts or the huge array of pamphlets in the health center . Maybe some of you had that in your heads as you were finalizing that statement of intent , but I 'd venture a guess that most prospective freshmen have bigger things on their minds than the quality of their favorite school 's sex ed . We want to examine programs , compare tuitions , and figure out exactly how far we need to go to keep the family 's weekend visits to a minimum . I think it 's safe to say that nobody prioritizes or plans to use what resources your sexual violence program offers . Unless you 're this guy . So sometimes , it can be a toss-up what kinds of reproductive resources you wind up with . Some of us , like me , just get lucky .
UC Merced is not a large campus . You could probably walk across it in twenty minutes at a brisk pace , and you would n't even miss a thing : The dining commons , housing , and the classroom buildings are all compacted onto this itty-bitty plot of land right up next to a bunch of bored , cud-chewing cows . It 's really quite a picture . What is unique about this campus , though , is its devotion to sexual health . Not only are first-year student required to attend at least two seminars on sexual violence prevention and sexual health , but advertisements for the latest social justice workshop or film panel are everywhere . And on a campus like UCM , where , chances are , your class is in one of three nearby buildings , it 's fairly easy to run into these ads at least four or five times a day . It 's kind of awesome .
Maybe that 's just my naïve self marveling at some newfound privilege that every other college kid has had for sometime , but the kind of devotion demonstrated by UCM faculty and offices is a marvel unto itself . Within two weeks of my first-year student year , I knew where I could go if I was raped or sexually assaulted . I knew that there were counselors available to talk to me , and that I would n't need to worry about affording their services . I knew that there were people who cared about my well-being and made it a part of their job to ensure all students knew about their resources , and who encouraged us to speak up against rape culture and intervene in situations where sexual violence might happen . There is a safety net of support waiting to catch anyone who needs it . Frankly , it 's amazing .
Contrast this to the greater Merced community , and it 's quite a picture you 've got . We have a Planned Parenthood ; it 's very nice . You ca n't get an abortion there , though , and the nearest place is one county over in Turlock . It also shares neighboring space with a couple crisis pregnancy centers , one of which I pass every time I go grocery shopping . They look nice , too – very respectable – except we all know the kinds of stunts those organizations pull . Am I the only one catching the dissonance ?
For the record , I realize that I 'm preaching to the choir . Feminists tend to understand the need for reproductive choice and resources much more readily than your common man/woman – and that 's usually because so many of us are already fighting for the cause . However , my overeager self believes that it ca n't be said enough just how important it is that we keep this discourse alive , especially in light of the recent spate of assaults against reproductive rights nationwide .
In a state like California , a place I love dearly , the legislature will probably never see a heartbeat bill or personhood amendment . Nevertheless , there are too many individuals in my county alone who do n't have access to the same privileges that I do . If they do n't have the travel accommodations or the money , they may have no recourse against an unwanted pregnancy . If they 're sexually assaulted , they might not have the benefit of a police force that will believe them , much less apprehend the assailant . If they need something as simple as a pregnancy test , who 's to say that they wo n't get it and a heaping of misinformation ?
So please , feel free to keep blabbing about this issue . Make waves , get people thinking . Slip it into idle conversation , bring it up the next time you see your book club , or regale a crowd with the tale at your friend 's dinner party . Some people ( like that friend ) might resent you for it , but this is a cause worth raising some hackles for . Once you get past the withering glares , it 's almost fun .
# Canada150 – A hashtag that you will begin seeing quite often if not already this year . Brands , citizens , and the Government of Canada will all be using this hashtag alongside others to show their pride as we approach Canada 's 150th anniversary on July 1st , 2017 . This creates a great opportunity for some brands to get in the conversation and ride on the “ Canadian pride train ” and be a part of something truly special .
TO 's # Canada150 celebrations kick off tomorrow . Even the Toronto Sign is joining in ! Introducing the `` TO Canada with Love '' 3D Leaf . # C150TO pic.twitter.com/cwa8P9LoYy — Special Events T.O . ( @ specialeventsTO ) December 31 , 2016
Canadians are going to feel more patriotic than ever this year , and quite surprisingly in a study published on strategy online , “ two-thirds of Canadians were open to receiving advertising from brands about the anniversary ” . It will be a crowded space for brands to say the least ! One thing to remember when it comes to brands hopping into a conversation is “ are they being authentic ? ” . Does the brand belong there ? Do we want to hear how Taco-Bell is celebrating # Canada150 ? Probably not . In the same strategy online article , they published the top 10 brands that Canadians expect to do the best job in celebrating the anniversary , based on an IMT report . Check them out below :
Tim Hortons ( 18 % ) Canadian Tire ( 12 % ) Hudson 's Bay Co. ( 12 % ) Coca-Cola ( 8 % ) Molson ( 6 % ) Roots ( 5 % ) Bell ( 5 % ) CBC ( 4 % ) McDonald 's ( 4 % ) Nike ( 4 % )
We will likely start seeing more ads come out as July 1st approaches . However , brands such as President 's Choice and RBC have already gotten started .
PC launched # EatTogether on January 1st . A 90 second TV spot that promotes the diversity and unity behind being a Canadian . It 's emotionally driven and it provides an introduction for their campaign that we are sure to see more of throughout the year . The challenge is to not only define what it “ means to be Canadian ” , but to do it in a unique and different way than the dozens of other major brands trying to find a seat at the table . My prediction is that there will be a few stand-out campaigns and a large amount of forgettable spots that were created for the sole purpose of riding on # Canada150 's coat-tails .
With all of these brands sure to get involved , it begs the question whether or not we will become tired of all the anniversary promotion . With each brand coming up with a new snazzy hashtag , anniversary fatigue might just become a reality . Of course , this is all speculation since the biggest brands have yet to unveil their campaigns . However , it 's something to think about for now .
What are some of the brands that you expect to celebrate # Canada150 the best ? Leave a comment below or drop a comment on our FB post !

Minneapolis oldsters , Jessica Finlay has your back .
Finlay , 28 , an environmental gerontologist at the University of Minnesota , has made fascinating discoveries with broad implications for city planners , architects and builders .
In their chosen field , the one they hope to pursue as their life 's work after getting a doctorate in 2018 , Finlay 's focus is senior citizens and how they interact physically and emotionally with their homes and neighborhoods .
Finlay found that seniors love skyways , dread icy sidewalks and joke about being killed while trying to cross a busy street — even with the light and in a crosswalk .
For some , their surroundings offer a robust menu of stimulation and golden-years fulfillment . Others are fearful and isolated .
Finlay studies seniors using the statistical and demographic tools of a geographer along with the more intuitive skills of a social worker . In the past year and a half they interviewed 125 seniors living independently ( average age 71 ) in downtown , north Minneapolis and Eden Prairie .
University of Minnesota doctoral candidate Jessica Finlay focuses on how senior citizens interact with their homes and neighborhoods .
After they posted fliers and talked about their research at senior centers , more than 300 seniors contacted her , wanting to be included . After a sit-down interview at each participant 's house , Finlay put away their tape recorder and did a touring interview .
“ I would go shopping , for groceries , to a doctor 's appointment , swimming , to child care , ” Finlay said . “ I sought to gauge their health status , their happiness quotient , their environment both at home and outside their houses , how they felt about their surroundings . ”
The country already has 46 million older adults , and that number is going to rise as nearly 80 million baby boomers enter their AARP years .
Far from the stereotype of oldsters heading to a golf-cart retirement community in Scottsdale , more than 96 percent of America 's older adults live independently in private homes , and only 1.5 million Americans over 65 live in institutional settings , according to Finlay 's research .
For many , finances put the snowbird life out of reach . Others just prefer to hang onto their home , vowing “ I 'll only leave in a gurney . ”
Even a cold-weather city like Minneapolis counts those over 60 as 25 percent of the population . The 50-plus population of Minneapolis increased 9 percent from 2010 to 2015 , said Christina Kendrick , who coordinates the city 's Advisory Committee on Aging .
Skyways vs. icy sidewalks
Finlay was curious to learn more about the “ place ” in the phrase “ age in place. ” They purposely chose to research Minnesota seniors , since there have been fewer studies here than in Sun Belt states .
“ I 'm a geographer , so I like to think that if we have certain environments we will have certain outcomes , ” they said . “ But it proved to be an individual 's relationship to their environment that matters a lot . ”
City streets that seem perfectly normal to younger , able-bodied users may look very different to seniors , as Finlay discovered on their mobile interviews . On a short walk in their neighborhood , one woman with limited mobility knew just where to find some waist-high retaining walls where they could rest for a minute .
Others were acutely aware of high curbs , bumps or cracks in the sidewalk that could cause a debilitating fall . Things as simple and inexpensive as a bench or a shade tree were cited by interview subjects as desirable . Such landscape “ microfeatures ” are macro deals to many seniors .
Construction zones are terrible for elders and the disabled , Finlay said . Ditto rerouted buses .
In wintertime , with snow , ice , unshoveled sidewalks or impassable berms left behind by plows , many seniors venture out much less often , making Minnesota winters seem extra long and isolating to them .
On the plus side , seniors love the Minneapolis skyway system : They 're weather-protected , mostly accessible for those using motorized chairs or walkers , and a safe and familiar environment for shopping and exercise .
Seeing that one of their downtown subjects had a grocery mart just across the street from where they lived , Finlay noted that as an environmental plus . Then they learned that the pedestrian crossing was timed so that the woman , who uses a walker , was unable to make it to the other side before the green light turned red . As a workaround , the woman sometimes drove across the street , drove to another store , or walked three blocks up the street to a crosswalk with a longer “ walk ” signal . So much for convenience .
A 63-year-old woman who lives downtown told Finlay , “ It 's kind of a joke in my building that we will each die on Washington Avenue , getting hit by a car . ”
“ The reality is that many people ... are n't able to function at a level that 's required by the built environment , ” according to Finlay . “ We design Peter Pan neighborhoods , imagining that we never grow old . ”
It 's the details
The built environment is , of course , just part of the picture for seniors seeking happiness and fulfillment .
In north Minneapolis , more than their other two study areas , “ it was striking how the longtime resident elders benefited from being completely enmeshed in their communities , ” Finlay said , whether through church , community , volunteering or intergenerational living situations .
That translated into a high “ happiness ” rating among North Siders , alongside complaints that “ we do n't have anywhere to go . ”
A food desert with no large grocery stores , the North Side also lacks coffee shops and other places to hang out . The new YMCA at Heritage Park , with its health clinic and senior center , was mentioned as a great resource by many of those Finlay interviewed .
Big issues , like adaptable housing for people of different income ranges , are important for long-term city planning , Kendrick said .
Finlay does n't disagree , but they urge policymakers to remember things like trees , benches , curbs and crosswalks because , they believe , “ little details matter . ”

Online privacy tools like Tor have become incredibly popular in the wake of Edward Snowden 's surveillance revelations . But according to an analysis of leaked source code from the National Security Agency , using or merely searching for information about those tools is enough to label someone an “ extremist ” in the eyes of the National Security Agency .
A series of articles published in German news outlets NDR and WDR seems to show that exhibiting any interest in tools used to hide one 's identity is interpreted as suspicious and marked for extra surveillance under the agency 's XKeyscore system—unless that activity comes from one of the nations of the “ Five Eyes ” surveillance alliance ( the United States , Canada , the United Kingdom , Australia , and New Zealand ) . The code , which is believed to still be in use by the NSA today , contains rules which monitors anyone communicating with services and email addresses associated with the Tor anonymity network , as well as websites such as the Linux Journal , a popular and long-running computing resource which Xkeyscore chillingly labels an “ extremist forum . ”
While shocking in its inclusiveness , the focus on privacy tools is not at all surprising to security experts . A previously published top-secret NSA document called “ Tor Stinks ” illustrated the agency 's ongoing frustration with trying to break the anonymity software . Ironically , Tor was originally developed by the U.S. Navy , and includes among its major financial benefactors the U.S. State Department , which touts its ability to help foreign dissidents circumvent government censorship . U.S. law enforcement including the Drug Enforcement Agency makes use of the tool for investigations , and the Federal Bureau of Investigation has even admitted that it has “ known legitimate uses . ”
Instead of connecting directly to websites , Tor , also known as The Onion Router , redirects a user 's web traffic through a zig-zagging network of relay computers run by volunteers around the world . By wrapping the communications inside “ layers ” of encryption , the relays obscure the true IP address of the user , both from the site 's owners and anyone else who happens to be monitoring the network . The NSA source code shows rules for specifically targeting volunteer-run Tor “ directory servers ” located in Germany , the U.S. , Sweden , Austria and the Netherlands .
The report also names the administrator of one such targeted directory , a German computer science student named Sebastian Hahn . “ Millions of people use it to stay safe online , and by watching the server and collecting metadata about its users , those people are put at risk. ” they told German TV network Das Erste .
Another tool specifically named in the NSA 's code is Tails , a Linux-based operating system specially designed for privacy and security which filters all of its Internet traffic through Tor and can be run from a CD-ROM or USB stick . Law enforcement often complains that these tools create a haven for child traffickers , terrorists and other serious criminals , but they are also routinely used by security researchers , journalists , human rights activists , private companies , and regular folks who just want some online privacy .
The Xkeyscore code shows that the NSA also targets other privacy tools such as HotSpotShield , FreeNet , Centurian , FreeProxies.org , MegaProxy and MixMinion . The rules contain filters that provide exceptions for servers in countries that are members of Five Eyes . But some appear to be written broadly enough to allow targeting inside those countries . For example , one rule targeting MixMinion includes all traffic sent to or from a server located on the campus of MIT , the report says .
There are a few ways Tor users can still be identified if they are not practicing good operational security , but the good news is that Tor itself has been so far proven secure—even from the NSA . The agency 's “ Tor Stinks ” presentation says that there are no practical ways of consistently identifying Tor users , concluding that “ We will never be able to de-anonymize all Tor users all the time . ”
But if that 's the case , why bother targeting privacy-conscious users at all ?
A likely answer is that the NSA is waiting for them to slip up . While Tor encrypts traffic as it bounces around its anonymizing network , it will still be transmitted in plain text at the beginning and end of the network if the site is not secured with transport encryption known as SSL/TLS , commonly seen as a “ lock ” icon inside the browser 's address bar . That means there is still an opportunity to collect the contents of emails sent over the Tor network , if the connection is n't secured and a criminal or spy agency is listening in the right places . Indeed , the report shows that the NSA does collect and store the contents of emails sent over Tor , whether or not they can read them .
When questioned about the surveillance of people interested in privacy , the NSA would only offer a statement saying that agency “ collects only what it is authorized by law to collect for valid foreign intelligence purposes—regardless of the technical means used by foreign intelligence targets . ”
It 's unclear whether or not the source code came from the material leaked by Snowden . But cryptography expert Bruce Schneier , who has worked with Glenn Greenwald on the Snowden documents , seems to think that both this story and a previous report in Der Spiegel about the NSA 's hacking tools are the result of a “ second leaker . ”
“ It 's hard to tell how extensive this is . It 's possible that anyone who clicked on this link—with the embedded torproject.org URL above—is currently being monitored by the NSA , ” they write .
“ Whatever the case , this is very disturbing . ”
Sean Hawkey is go-getter . The type of photographer so motivated by their convictions and interest , they do n't think twice about undertaking a new endeavor , a new adventure . Hawkey is n't deterred by difficulty , they have the patience of a saint and those characteristics shine through in their photography . Hawkey has spent over a decade travelling among , photographing , and reporting on a number of different cultures ; documenting human interest stories as a freelance journalist . Given the nature of their job , and all that it entails , it 's a given the photographer has seen their fair share of adversity . Being a travelling photojournalist is no career for the faint of heart , but Hawkey need not trouble themselves with such things . When the trials of their chosen occupation rear their ugly heads , Hawkey coolly answers back , is that all you got ?
With the notion to break away from the norm , set down the digital , and focus on doing something differently , Hawkey set their eyes on the Sotrami mine . As part of the Free Trade Foundation , the Sotrami mine has recently undergone several changes in policy which abolished child labor and gave worker 's rights a boost . Hawkey recognized the efforts and sought to work on a project which would help highlight Sotrami 's progress . There have been , of course , photography projects that document the lives of miners , but Hawkey 's project was different . Hawkey had come up with the idea to incorporate not just the mine worker 's faces and stories , but also the product of their labors . Using silver nitrate from Sotrami 's lab as part of the developing process , Hawkey would create a series of tintype portraits of the very miners who dug it from the earth .
As romantic of an idea as the project was , it would n't be a sunset stroll down the beach . After piecing together a camera with a lens from France and bellows and body from Ukraine , they spent time at their home in England learning the wet process–a difficult task in itself . They called up John Brewer to help them perfect the craft of tintypes .
Then , once arriving in Peru , Hawkey learned two essential chemicals needed to develop the tintypes , nitric acid and diethyl ether , which they had to bring into the country , were going to be held up in customs for two weeks . Upon their receipt , Hawkey loaded up their nearly 50 pounds of antique camera equipment and metal plates into a pickup and began their journey to Sotrami .
At the mouth of the mine , Hawkey set up their studio and darkroom . Much to their surprise , the miners were very interested in what they were doing . They were entertained when they saw Hawkey add a sugary Inca Cola to their chemicals , which helped prevent heat induced fogging . Finally , things were starting to fall in line . All the miners expressed an interest in having their portrait taken . Before long , word had gotten out about what they were up to . Hawkey told the New York Times ,
“ I was in bed one night when I heard a knock on my door . There were four police officers there . I knew there were security issues because the mine produces gold and silver . One of the police officers said , ‘ We hear you are taking photos of the miners . Can you take some of us , too ? ”
Hawkey gladly obliged .
What started as a wild idea , Hawkey 's vision became a reality . The inherent , rustic qualities of a wet plate collodion process coupled with the miner 's prematurely aged faces and tired eyes ( both the result of carrying 100 pound sacks up ladders on a daily basis , some since childhood ) , the images Hawkey captured beautifully portray the Peruvian mine workers .
Take a look a handful of images from the project , below , and be sure to head over to Sean Hawkey 's website for more .

With the completion of this week 's four-game sweep over the Chicago White Sox , the Tribe starters have continued their incredibly impressive hot streak . Ever since Carlos Carrasco 's last meltdown on July 6 , they 've been consistently dominant . That 's not news , as I wrote about this previously already .
But here are a few more notable facts about what the Indians starters have accomplished of late :
— Here are the starting pitcher statistics in 21 games since July 7 :
9-2 record , 2.21 ERA , 134.3 IP ( 6.1/start ) , 8.0 K/9 , 3.0 BB/9 , .198/.268/.291 line .
— For the striking contrast , here are the starting pitcher statistics in the season 's first 87 games :
30-34 record , 4.62 ERA , 494.2 IP ( 5.2/start ) , 8.0 K/9 , 3.5 BB/9 , .262/.335/.427 line .
— And again , the starting pitching line that derailed the entire 162-game set in 2012 :
48-76 record , 5.25 ERA , 913.2 IP ( 5.2/start ) , 6.1 K/9 , 3.5 BB/9 , .284/.351/.451 line .
— The pitching was slightly improved in the first half of this season across the board , while especially picking up the pace with the strikeouts . But still , their 4.62 ERA ranked in the bottom segment of the AL . Now , the Indians have had as impressive of a pitching streak as has taken place ever in franchise history . The .560 OPS allowed is in stark contrast to the .802 OPS from last season .
— Currently , all five long-term Indians starters ( Masterson , Kluber , Kazmir , Jimenez and McAllister ) have at least 12 starts with ERAs less than 4.20 . The last time that happened in franchise history was 1969 . Every single other American League team has turned this feat since at least 1976 .
— The Indians now have four starters ( all but McAllister ) with at least 100 innings pitched that average at least 8.0 K/9 . No other team in American League history has ever had this feat . Both Boston and Detroit have three such pitchers in 2013 , but only three times has an AL team finished with exactly three , including the 1964 Indians as led by Sam McDowell .
— Specifically , Justin Masterson had their 11th start of at least 5 innings with one run or less last night . They became just the sixth Indians pitcher to pull off that feat since 1975 . The last five : Cliff Lee , 2008 ; CC Sabathia , 2006 ; CC Sabathia , 2005 ; Charles Nagy , 1992 ; Greg Swindell , 1989 .
— Tonight 's starter , Ubaldo Jimenez , had their best start of the season in their last outing , as measured by Game Score ( 81 ) . They worked eight shutout innings for the second time this year . It was officially their best start as a Cleveland Indian , surpassing their outing on June 1 ( 80 ) . Their last better outing per Game Score ( 84 ) was Oct. 2 , 2010 , with Colorado .
— Overall , the Indians have allowed just 58 runs ( seven unearned runs ) in their last 21 games since July 7 . Only eight other MLB teams have had better 21-game pitching stretches thus far in 2013 .

The benefits of continuing to improve AI are seemingly endless . Machines with the ability to self-diagnose and self-correct could vastly improve cybersecurity .
Artificially intelligent robots could care for our elderly , perform checkups on the chronically ill , and administer vaccines in war-torn countries . AI is already being used to collate massive datasets related to cancer research in order to find patterns researchers often miss .
There is a darker side to the rise of automation , however . Over the past few decades , automation claimed six million US manufacturing jobs . As machines are able to complete more complex tasks , more jobs performed by humans are at risk . “ The American middle class was built on the back of routine work , McAfee , associate director of the MIT Center for Digital Business at the Sloan School of Management , asserts . “ Lots of those jobs have already been automated . ”
Automation has been eroding away at jobs since the 1960s , but the pace of replacement is quickening . Self-driving AI is already poised to displace 15 % of the world 's working population . In the decades to come , automation could claim many more jobs , and displace up to 47 % of the workforce , according to one Oxford study . “ The pace of technological innovation is still increasing , with more sophisticated software technologies disrupting labour markets by making workers redundant , ” explain the authors of the Oxford study .
“ While computerisation has been historically confined to routine tasks involving explicit rule-based activities , algorithms for big data are now rapidly entering domains reliant upon pattern recognition and can readily substitute for a wide range of non-routine cognitive tasks . ”
Advancement in artificial intelligence has led to smarter software and smarter robots . Robots are able to complete more complex physical tasks , recognize subtler patterns , and have experienced a marked increase in their sensory abilities . Therefore , manual labor , manufacturing , transportation and logistics jobs are all at very high risk for computerization .
Interestingly , according to the same study , service jobs , one with the highest rate of growth over the past twenty years or so , is also at very high risk of automation . Jobs that require social intelligence and creative ability are the only ones that have a very low risk of computerization , according to their findings .
What is the plan to address the massive underemployment issue the world will be facing ? Currently there seems to be little in terms of preparation . Job training programs in the US are dangerously underfunded . Simply pushing the lower and middle classes to attain higher education could lead to further stagnation . Even if job training and higher rates of secondary education were supported as solutions and given proper funding , there is no guarantee that workers would win the race against automation . Poverty in an age of automation could very possibly be widespread . If we unprepared for the massive shifts AI will bring , it could even be devastating .
A universal basic income ( UBI ) could be the answer . UBI promises all citizens the money they need for food and shelter — unconditionally . It may sound like an idea on the bleeding edge , but , in actuality , it was proposed by Thomas Paine as “ a dividend for all citizens ” some 200 years ago .
Some maintain that a basic income would simply be too expensive to manage . “ Setting up a basic income would be no easy matter , ” writes R.A. for The Economist . “ [ A ] country as rich as America would need to raise the share of GDP collected in tax by nearly 10 percentage points . ”
Others , such as tech luminary Elon Musk , founder of Tesla and SpaceX , have emerged as strong proponents of UBI , arguing that basic income would be much cheaper to implement than current welfare systems . “ I think we 'll end up going with universal basic income , ” Musk said at the World Government Summit in Dubai . “ It 's going to be necessary . ”
Y Combinator , a company that helps startups with seed funding is currently conducting a five-year study to observe the effects of implementing UBI on a relatively large scale . “ In a world where technology eliminates jobs , it will mean that the cost of having a great life goes down a lot , ” Altman , President of Y Combinator , wrote on Twitter . “ And I think we need something like basic income to have a cushion and a smooth transition to the jobs of the future . ”
Addressing the ever-expanding issue of computerization will certainly be a major challenge . Retraining and re-educating workers may help , but , at the same time , it could prove to be only a short-term solution . Universal basic income could be the answer to massive rates of unemployment by providing every citizen with the money for clothes , rent , and food . While it may seem exorbitantly expensive to implement at the present moment , automation could increase production and decrease costs enough to make a universal basic income manageable .

Oh , how the mighty have fallen . Starting 11 player to first team player to U-21 squad player . Jozy Altidore came into the 2013-2014 Premier League season with high hopes . They had signed a new contract with Sunderland and was coming off a 31-goal season with AZ Alkmaar . Altidore was returning to the Premier League to make amends for their lackluster season with Hull City in the 2009-2010 campaign . Their disappointing Premier League experience with Hull City was largely written off because of young age and lack of experience , but they still had to appease critics and prove they could play Premier League ball .
And boy , did they show them…
Altidore 's performance this year has been so disappointing that there are n't words to truly describe how poor of a season they have had . Sunderland brought them to be a hold-up striker and produce like they have for AZ and the United States Men 's National Team . Instead , Altidore has only appeared in 28 of Sunderland 's 34 league games . They have made 19 starts and nine substitute appearances , but their playing time and impact on the field are even less than what those numbers could suggest . Altidore has taken only 27 shots this season , scored only one goal , and notched only one assist . The man , who Sunderland brought in to score goals and provide for even more , has spent this season sitting on the bench staring relegation in the face rather than helping their team 's cause . I say this tongue-in-cheek , but Altidore has been a more effective player for Liverpool than their own team this season . On Sunday , Altidore endured a tackle from Chelsea 's Azpilicueta , and went down in the box . The penalty has been debated to if it was even a tackle or not , but regardless , Altidore earned a penalty for Sunderland . The penalty was converted by Fabio Borini , and won the game for Sunderland . Not only did Altidore help Sunderland steal three points , but in a weird turn of events , this may have won the Premier League title for Liverpool . The Chelsea lose increased Liverpool 's lead to five points with only three games left to play . I did say tongue-in-cheek , but Altidore 's importance for Liverpool vs Sunderland can ultimately be argued to be true .
What 's most frustrating about Altidore 's season is we do n't really know why it 's gone awry . Was it the manager change ? Was they brought into a system that was n't a good fit for him ? Have they been out of form or shown a lack of effort ? It could be any of these , or could it be that Altidore simply ca n't hang in the Premier League ? It 's well known that various leagues around the world have their own unique style of play . For example , Altidore played in the Eredivisie where they played against defenses that did n't play much defense . This allowed them to score 39 goals in 67 games . That 's not to discredit their attacking abilities , but the defenses they faced in Holland bolstered their stats and did n't prepare them for the Premier League 's style of play . Every player in the world is n't going to have the same amount of success in every league . Granted , there are players such as Cristiano Ronaldo , Samuel Eto ' o , and Zlatan Ibrahimović who have shown they are exceptional no matter the league , but these are world-class players . Not every player can adapt to a league as it may not suit their style . Take for instance Roberto Soldado . They scored 101 goals in 207 La Liga games , but has only managed to score six goals 27 Premier League games for Tottenham . That 's a decent contribution , but that does n't live up to their goal scoring reputation or the £26,000,000 fee Tottenham paid to acquire their services . Altidore may be one of those players whose style of play does n't translate well to Premier League , or maybe they just needs to be in the right situation . Time will only tell , but one thing 's for sure , Altidore most likely wo n't be back in the Premier League for awhile . If Sunderland does the unthinkable and staves off relegation , he 's rumored to be leaving during the summer transfer window .
This is a bit of a humbling experience for me because this is n't my first take on Altidore 's situation , and how more wrong could I have been . I supported Altidore in every way I possibly could . At the bottom half of the previous piece , you 'll find me acting as Altidore 's defense attorney . I blamed their failures on everything from them still getting used to joining a new team to Gus Poyet failing to utilize their skillset properly . I rejected the notion that Altidore needed a move out of Sunderland and that we needed to be patient , but in hindsight I was a bit naïve . Altidore needs to leave Sunderland during the summer transfer window , and what better way to improve their stock than by having a great showing at the World Cup ? Positive performances in this summer 's World Cup will show to teams that Altidore is still Altidore , and that he 's a valuable player . Before we get ahead of ourselves and predict where he 'll be moving to , first thing 's first : Altidore needs to show well during the USMNT 's World Cup training camp to make the squad . With Altidore showing very poorly at Sunderland and “ bubble ” players such as Terrance Boyd , Chris Wondolowski , and Juan Agudelo showing well for club or country , the pressure is heavy on Altidore .
When Edward Snowden met journalists in their cramped room in Hong Kong 's Mira hotel in June , their mission was ambitious . Amid the clutter of laundry , meal trays and their four laptops , they wanted to start a debate about mass surveillance . They succeeded beyond anything the journalists or Snowden themselves ever imagined . Their disclosures about the NSA resonated with Americans from day one . But they also exploded round the world . For some , like Congresswoman Zoe Lofgren , it is a vitally important issue , one of the biggest of our time : nothing less than the defence of democracy in the digital age .

But the intelligence agencies dismiss such claims , arguing that their programs are constitutional , and subject to rigorous congressional and judicial oversight . Secrecy , they say , is essential to meet their overriding aim of protecting the public from terrorist attacks .

The debate has raged across time zones : from the US and Latin America to Europe and to Asia .

Brazilian president Dilma Rousseff cancelled a state visit to Washington in protest at the US spying on them Bolivian president Evo Morales 's plane was forced down in Vienna amid suspicion that Snowden was being smuggled out of Russia . In Germany , a `` livid '' Angela Merkel accused the US of spying on her , igniting a furore that has seen the White House concede that new constraints on the NSA 's activities may be necessary . Meanwhile , in Britain , prime minister David Cameron accused the Guardian of damaging national security by publishing the revelations , warning that if it did not `` demonstrate some social responsibility it would be very difficult for government to stand back and not to act '' .
Caught in a net US internet companies , their co-operation with the NSA exposed by Snowden 's documents , fear a worldwide consumer backlash , and claim they were forced into co-operation by the law .

Much of the NSA 's defence is that the public should be unconcerned , summed up by the dictum : “ If you have nothing to hide , you have nothing to fear. ” But civil liberties groups such as the Electronic Frontier Foundation and the American Civil Liberties Union warn that surveillance goes well beyond what Congress intended and what the US constitution allows .

Cell phones , laptops , Facebook , Skype , chat-rooms : all allow the NSA to build what it calls ‘ a pattern of life ' , a detailed profile of a target and anyone associated with them . And the number of people caught up in this dragnet can be huge .
Three degrees of separation You do n't need to be talking to a terror suspect to have your communications data analysed by the NSA . The agency is allowed to travel `` three hops '' from its targets — who could be people who talk to people who talk to people who talk to you . Facebook , where the typical user has 190 friends , shows how three degrees of separation gets you to a network bigger than the population of Colorado . How many people are three `` hops '' from you ?

Faced with growing public and political concern over the quantities of data it is collecting , the NSA has sought to reassure people , arguing that it collected only a tiny proportion of the world 's internet traffic , roughly equivalent to a “ dime on a basketball court ” . But in reality , that is still a huge amount of data . The Library of Congress , one of the biggest libraries in the world , gathers 5 terabytes a month . The NSA sucks up much , much more .
Since you began reading this , the NSA has selected terabytes terabytes of data for review . That 's about
two-hour HD movies .
The NSA say it needs all this data to help prevent another terrorist attack like 9/11 . In order to find the needle in the haystack , they argue , they need access to the whole haystack .

Another quarterback named Barker may be soon wearing an Alabama jersey .
Spain Park senior quarterback Braxton Barker - the son of Alabama national championship quarterback Jay Barker - revealed on Twitter that he 's received a preferred walk-on offer from the Crimson Tide .
The 6-foot , 180-pound Barker completed 172-of-287 passes for 2,228 yards , with 19 touchdown passes and eight interceptions , in 2017 as the Jaguars finished 6-5 and lost to Hewitt-Trussville in the first round of the Class 7A playoffs .
Spain Park coach Shawn Raney said during the season that they expected small schools , whether Football Championship Sub-Division or Division II , to make a run at signing Barker .
But the idea of playing at Alabama , where their father led the Crimson Tide to the 1992 national championship and the iconic victory over Miami , even as a walk-on , might be too seductive for the younger Barker to turn down .

Jay Barker , who played their high school football for Hewitt-Trussville , completed 56.9 percent of their passes from 1991-94 at Alabama , throwing 26 touchdown passes . As a senior , they won the Johnny Unitas Golden Arm award and finished in the top 10 in Heisman Trophy voting . They now works as a radio host in Birmingham .

Some fun effect and layout ideas for the first step of a checkout process in an online store . We are using the morphing buttons concept together with CSS transforms and transitions .
View demo Download source
A while back we explored a morphing button concept where the active element gets transformed into its target , aiming to create a fluid UI experience with a semantic connection of the involved elements . Today we want to apply that same concept and some other ideas to the first step of the checkout process . The checkout process in online stores is one of the most challenging and crucial in terms of UI design . Done well it can create a pleasant and smooth purchasing experience for the user ; done wrong , it can lead to an abandoned shopping cart and no sale at all . There are many carefully planned and well designed e-commerce sites out there and making the UI uncluttered is definitely a great trend welcomed by anyone who buys things online .
With the demos we 've created today we are looking into how we can make the peek into the shopping cart , one of the potential first steps of the purchase process , more fun and engaging while exploring some new layouts and effects .
They are simple concepts that hopefully spark your imagination for new ideas .
Please note that we use lots of new CSS properties that will only work in modern browsers .
IE does not allow a transformation of table rows which is a real shame ; so you might not see the table rows animating in some of the effects .

A Brain Protein Gone Awry Provides Schizophrenia Clue
The scientific leap from the wild hallucinations and delusions that mark schizophrenia to changes in the brain at the molecular level is a huge one .
Researchers who 've been working to define the connection are pretty sure of one thing , though . There are lots of pathways that lead to schizophrenia , each one with many steps .
Scientists at Johns Hopkins have figured out something quite interesting about one of them . A tiny change to a single protein can make a big difference . It 's `` just one specific protein modification , '' psychiatrist Akira Sawa tells Shots of the discovery . The protein of interest is the product of a gene called DISC1 ( DISC for Disrupted in Schizophrenia ) that 's been associated with schizophrenia , mood disorders and autism . Timing of the change is everything , Sawa and their colleagues have determined .
It seems that early in brain development , the DISC1 protein spurs the growth of brain cells in the cerebral cortex . And then , something — just what is still being worked out — alters the protein slightly , and instead of making brain cells , the protein pushes those brain cells out to the part of the brain where they belong .
The researchers ' experiments in mice have shown that the switchover is a key step in building a healthy brain . If the brain is n't built right , the person may be more prone to schizophrenia , and perhaps autism as well . The findings appear in the latest issue of the scientific journal Nature .
The mechanism behind schizophrenia seems kind of Rube Goldberg-ian : This lever controls that lever which controls that switch which may lead to schizophrenic behavior .
It 's also kind of promising . Researchers might be able to work their new knowledge into a test to see if a person has the right form of the protein at the right time . And maybe , just maybe , if indeed the issue is timing , they can one day figure out a way to fix things .
Former NBA coach Stan Van Gundy referred to the Brooklyn Nets as a `` bush league organization '' in a radio interview Monday .
The Nets , who entered the season with title aspirations , went into Tuesday 's night 's game against the Spurs with a 10-20 record , which dropped further after San Antonio cruised to an easy 113-92 victory .
Aside from its poor play on the court , the Nets were dealt a devastating blow recently when center Brook Lopez was lost for the year due to a broken foot .
`` I think with all the injuries it 's been hard to evaluate Jason Kidd . It 's been easy to jump on them not just because of the record , but the things coming out of their locker room , the situation with Lawrence Frank , the incident of spilling the drink on the floor , '' Van Gundy told the `` Amani and Etyian Show '' on NBC Sports Radio .
`` I mean this has looked like a bush league organization much of the year , they do n't play with much effort at all , a very uninspired team . But at the same time they had so many people hurt you just do n't know . And now they are not they are not going to be healthy all year…
`` You can do whatever you want with the coaching situation but it is not going to change the situation with their roster . They just do n't have a lot of options -- they do n't have draft picks , they are way over the salary cap . They are probably in the worst situation of any team in the NBA right now . ''
Kidd responded directly to Van Gundy 's comments later Tuesday before the Nets faced the Spurs .
`` Well I think we have one of the best owners ( Mikhail Prokhorov ) , and so I 'm confident , '' Kidd told reporters in San Antonio . `` We 've got a group of guys in there that are fighting , and we can only take care of one thing that that 's tonight 's game . Everybody has a right to their opinion , but the guys in that locker room are fighting , and we look forward to tonight 's game . ''

There is no better illustration of gilded , internet-age New York than the High Line . Anchored on the south by the relocated Whitney Museum and on the north by the high-rises of Hudson Yards , the elevated park sits at the center of a real estate frenzy that has uprooted earlier generations of gentrifiers , art galleries , and even the city 's sense of who should control public space .
The story of how we got here , however , has evolved over time . Before it opened with a series of ribbon-cuttings between 2009 and 2014 , the High Line spent a decade in gestation , developing as the idea of a group of Chelsea residents , then spreading to the city 's gala-hopping elites , and eventually winning the embrace of the Bloomberg administration . During this era , much of the public discussion about the park was old-fashioned boosterism , gushing about its high-design , post-industrial aesthetic , its magnetic pull on tourists , and its role as lynchpin for the mushrooming art , restaurant , retail , and condominium scene in West Chelsea and the Meatpacking District .
This type of cheerleading is epitomized by New York Post restaurant and real estate writer Steve Cuozzo , who earlier this year called the park a “ masterpiece ” and “ true wonder of our age ” that has enabled “ limitless popular pleasure. ” Anyone who has misgivings about the High Line , they said , implies “ that the High Line is somehow a racist creation ” and is sympathizing with “ reactionary leftists who prefer the crime-and-decay-ridden New York of the 1980s . ”
Inconveniently for Cuozzo , one person with second thoughts is Friends of the High Line co-founder Robert Hammond , who now thinks the High Line did n't pay enough attention to low- and moderate-income New Yorkers , particularly those in public housing next door to the park . “ We were from the community . We wanted to do it for the neighborhood , ” they told CityLab in February . “ Ultimately , we failed . ”
Lately , Hammond has been seeking redemption , pushing other high-profile park projects around the country to bake equity into their decision-making processes . Friends of the High Line has also been trying to make up for lost time , launching arts and jobs initiatives with residents of nearby public housing . Danya Sherman , former director of public programs , education , and community engagement for Friends of the High Line , details these efforts in their contribution to Deconstructing the High Line , a series of essays by academics , architects , and those involved in the making of the elevated park .
Equity initiatives are worthwhile , but Hammond 's recent conversion and Sherman 's essay evoke a sinking feeling that these good intentions are simply too little , too late . Before the High Line proffered progressivism through its programming , other contributors to the book note , it cast cold , hard capitalism in concrete .
In recent years , mountains of ink have been spilled about how the ills facing contemporary New York and cities around the globe have been exacerbated by the High Line 's complicity , including its fostering of income inequality and “ growth machine ” politics , inequitable parks funding , and private influence over public space . Other books about the High Line either do n't engage these critiques or only do so through the eyes of Hammond and Friends of the High Line co-founder Joshua David , who authored a book promising “ the inside story ” in 2011 .
Hammond often says the High Line “ gets too much credit and too much blame ” for the redevelopment of West Chelsea . But this elides the fact that the High Line was joined at the hip with the West Chelsea rezoning , which did not include affordable-housing mandates . The park 's sleek design and elite supporters also place the High Line at the center of a “ creative class ” vision for a hyper-gentrified Manhattan , to the point that the neighborhood 's transformation has even priced out all but the most expensive art galleries .
Defenders often praise the High Line as a modern-day project on par with Central Park , but beyond noting the role both parks serve as iconic green spaces , few make the connections illuminated by journalist Tom Baker . Both parks , they say , are pastoral constructions of an idealized past — for Central Park , a rural vision , and for the High Line , an industrial one — serving as romanticized respites in the ever-quickening city . Picking up that thread , architecture professor Christoph Lindner also notes the irony that both parks were built with the goal of spurring real estate development : These spaces are meant to be experienced slowly , but are also designed to accelerate the surrounding city .
Yet for all the High Line 's flaws , there is a silver lining , argues anthropologist Julian Brash : It was built primarily with public funds and envisioned from the start as a city park open to all . “ We need to see the High Line not as representing a new paradigm of public space , or as its betrayal , ” they write . “ Instead , we need to see the publicness of the High Line as an unfulfilled promise. ” Without this belief in the High Line as a public endeavor , there would be little space for the parks-equity movement to question the wisdom of using private funding to support discrete components of the parks system while parks in less well-off areas face continued budget cuts .
While academics and the public continue to learn lessons at the intersection of private interests and public space , the billionaires who made the High Line possible are continuing down the road of ever-greater private influence . Barry Diller and Diane von Furstenberg , who gave tens of millions of dollars to Friends of the High Line , have donated an even larger sum to the Hudson River Park Trust to build an elevated , undulating concert venue on stilts above the Hudson River at Pier 55 . It would be open to the public but managed by a nonprofit created by Mr. Diller and their family foundation .
It 's this type of conspicuous , plutocrat-driven development that makes the High Line ( and modern Manhattan itself ) iconic , but it remains an example with limited utility to other places . Other elevated parks are either completed or proposed in Jersey City , Chicago , and Philadelphia , and essays in Deconstructing the High Line look at efforts in Queens , São Paulo , and Rotterdam , each with its own series of parallel and divergent tracks from the glitzy West Side showpiece .
While other cities pursue their own elevated parks , the High Line 's location in the backyard of billionaires makes it a powerful symbol at the center of debates over our increasingly unequal and divided society .
But sometimes , it 's just a nice place to take a walk .

When the Detroit Red Wings drafted Vili Saarijarvi , their mobility and smarts eclipsed concern over theirs size .
Two years later , Saarijarvi has done what they can about the latter . They looked good during the development camp the Wings had early this month in Traverse City , showing off their fluid skating . Saarijarvi , a third-round pick , 73rd overall , from 2015 is eyeing their first year with the Grand Rapids Griffins after a couple of standout seasons in the OHL .
“ I 'm expecting a tough and hard year , ” Saarijarvi said . “ I try to to work as hard as possible every day . I am excited . It 's a great group of guys there , a great city , great fans , so I am excited . ”
An injury limited Saarijarvi , 20 , to 34 games this past season with Mississauga , but they packed 31 points and a plus-20 rating , and followed up with 15 points in 20 playoff games . They spent the 2015-16 season with the Flint Firebirds , where they had 43 points and was minus-15 in 59 games .
“ I think I have improved a lot , on the ice and off the ice , too , strength-wise , ” Saarijarvi said . “ I 've gotten a lot stronger and put some weight on .
“ I am not going to get so much taller , so it is about getting stronger . I know I am a good skater , that I can play the game . ”
Saarijarvi stands about 5 feet 10 . They said they were around 160 pounds when they were drafted , and is now around 175 pounds .
That Saarijarvi shoots right was part of the appeal in drafting him , as right-shot defensemen are rarer than left-shooting ones . Saarijarvi is mobile , makes good decisions with the puck , and has a knack for getting their shot through from the blueline . He 'll have a chance with the Griffins to show they can run a power play in the AHL , as they did in the OHL .
“ It is going to be a lot harder to do at the next level but I want to take the challenge and work on it as much as possible , ” Saarijarvi said . “ I can do a lot of skill stuff . ”
Wings director of player development Shawn Horcoff kept an eye on Saarijarvi as the Steelheads went to the OHL Conference finals .
“ I was really impressed with their game this year , ” Horcoff said . “ Coming back from injury they looked great . They are a dynamic defensive player . They are going to have to learn to defend in the pro game , but they have a big upside offensively . ”
Saarijarvi got a visual measure of what 's ahead when they spent time with the Griffins during their AHL Conference finals series .
“ It was great opportunity for me , ” Saarijarvi said . “ It 's faster , it 's stronger . Guys are older , so you have to be a lot smarter and stronger and faster on the ice . ”

Newt Gingrich is spreading concern that Islamic law may creep into U.S. courts . Oklahoma bans Sharia law
Oklahoma on Tuesday approved a ballot measure blocking judges from considering Islamic or international law when making a ruling .
Nearly 70 percent of voters in the state cast ballots approving the measure .
Story Continued Below
The proposition 's sponsor , Republican Rex Duncan , told reporters Tuesday that the proposition is a `` preemptive strike '' against judges who they worry could be “ legislating from the bench or using international law or Sharia law . ”
Opponents of the measure pointed out that the First Amendment bars Congress from make any law respecting the establishment of religion .
The proposition also faced criticism from Muslim leaders who have said they intend to challenge it in court .
Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich is one of the top voices spreading concern that Islamic law may creep into American courts , although they have not provided proof that such fears are justified .
Gingrich attracted national headlines in September at the Values Voter Summit in Washington when they declared , “ I am opposed to any efforts to impose Sharia in the United States . ”
“ We should have a federal law that says under no circumstances in any jurisdiction in the United States will Sharia [ law ] be used in any court to apply to any judgment made about American law , ” Gingrich said .
ISLAMABAD : Taking advantage of the absence of many ruling party members , the National Assembly Standing Committee on Information Technology approved a proposal to allow the military-run Special Communication Organisation ( SCO ) to operate commercially and compete with the private telecom operators .
This was in strong contrast to the opposition by the government and the Senate Standing Committee on Information Technology .
“ This committee directs the Ministry of IT to facilitate SCO , ” said chairperson of the committee , MNA Syed Ali Raza Abidi of the MQM . The committee met for a briefing on the performance of the SCO .
The support for the SCO came after its regulatory affairs director retired Col Ghulam Hussain Anjum pleaded the case to allow the organisation to operate as a commercial entity .
Govt and Senate committee on IT have already opposed move to give free hand to SCO to compete with private telecom companies
For the last two years , the SCO has been demanding autonomy to operate commercially and expand its services across the country and earn revenues .
Mr Anjum argued that the SCO was losing market business to competitors in the telecom sector such as Mobilink and Zong .
MNA Amjad Khan of the PTI also supported the proposal and said : “ SCO has worked in some of the most difficult terrains to spread telecom infrastructure in Gilgit-Baltistan and AJK . It deserves to generate revenues . ”
In the past , the SCO proposed a free licence to operate and compete with other telecommunication operators such as Mobilink , Telenor and Zong throughout the country . It also demanded a tax exemption on its income , assets , turnover and sales and customs duties on imports and exports . Above all , the SCO said it should continue to be funded by the federal government .
The SCO was established in 1976 to develop , operate and maintain telecommunications services in AJK and GB .
Secretary Ministry of IT Rizwan Bashir told the committee that the SCO proposal to operate as a commercial entity would contradict government 's deregulation policy .
“ The intent of the deregulation policy is to see the private sector flourish . The government feels that giving a free hand to SCO to operate commercially could have serious implications for the investors ' confidence . The move can hurt growth of the economy and in particular the telecommunications sector is against such a move , ” said Mr Bashir .
Joint Secretary Khalid Raza Gardezi said all financial needs of the SCO were being met by the government to ensure it operated smoothly .
“ The SCO takes 80pc of the IT ministry 's budget every fiscal year , ” said Mr Gardezi .
Secretary Rizwan Bashir added that the government was discussing with the SCO and members of the Senate Committee on Information Technology to find a solution to the issue .
Chairman Abidi said the SCO needed to be kept alive without putting pressure on the exchequer .
“ We hope that the issue will be solved for the betterment of the organisation and the country , ” they said .

Twitter fell offline on Tuesday morning ( 19 January ) , as users in the UK , US , Japan , Africa and Europe were unable to read or send tweets . The service is unavailable through its own website , and also through the iOS and Android apps , and third party applications like Tweetdeck .
UPDATE 11:40am
Would you look at that - just as we thought it was fixed , Twitter appears to have gone down again . The company 's own status page says there are service disruptions with the friends , tweets and search functions . For some users the website is also offline , while the graph below shows how the complaints rise and fall as Twitter crashes and recovers over the morning .
10:55am
It looks like Twitter is just about fixed now . Our tweets are mostly getting through , and our timeline is coming back up to speed after about an hour in darkness . Twitter is yet to say anything else , beyond it is working on the problem .
With that , we suggest you stop panicking and get back to work .
10:00am
We are starting to see Twitter come back online now . Some tweets send from our London office are working , although Twitter itself still reports service disruptions on three of its five services , including the home page and search .
9:05am
Some tweets are now starting to get through using Tweetdeck , but the service is still somewhat hit-and-miss .
9:00am
Twitter has now also recognised the problem on its general status page . The problem is being described as a `` service issue '' , which means `` some users are currently experiencing problems accessing Twitter . We are aware of the issue and are working towards a resolution . ''
8:50am
Twitter 's own API status page for app developers now recognises the global problem . It notes a `` service disruption '' for both the timeline and home page . There are also `` performance issues '' with the search tool and 'friends ' section of the site .
Original story
The message greeting users trying to log on reads : `` Something is technically wrong . Thanks for noticing - we 're going to fix it up and have things back to normal soon . '' Despite today 's outage , Twitter is much more stable than it used to be . Early adopters who used the service in 2008 and 2009 will recall a site which regularly crashed , greeting users with the infamous 'fail whale ' error page .
Problems began at around 8am GMT , with several staff at IBTimes UK unable to send tweets or view their timelines . DownDetector , a website which reports of site and service outages , confirms that Twitter is indeed having problems .
The heat map below , from DownDetector , shows where Twitter is unavailable . By 8:40am the problems had spread across the UK , Europe , Japan and parts of the US . Twitter 's official service page is yet to recognise the incident , but does mention a `` service issue '' the previous morning , which lasted for 10 minutes . There were also issues on 15 January and 19 November , 2015 .
If we zoom in you can see that most of the problems are being reported in London and the south east of the UK .
Users are reporting the most problems on Twitter 's website , with 56 % of DownDetector users saying there is a problem there . A third are unable to use Twitter through the iOS app , while 12 % are having issues with the Android application .
There have so far been over 2,200 reports of problems , while the entire IBTimes UK office is unable to use Twitter .
The 'Is It Down Right Now ' website claims Twitter is offline `` for everyone '' , suggesting all 300 million users are unable to use the service . Comments on the site are from users unable to access Twitter in Brazil , Kenya , Ghana , Algeria , Croatia , the US , UK , Belgium , Portugal , Colombia , Germany , France , Morocco , South Africa , Holland , Switzerland , Georgia , Italy , Turkey , Austria , Dubai , Greece , Rwanda , Canada , Pakistan ... pretty much everywhere .
These days certain factions of the Alt Right see the value in religiosity and tradition but decry Christianity as a foreign religion promoting slave morality . They seek to undo the West 's dissolution in part through a religious revival based on pre-Christian pagan values and rituals .
They will fail , just as Julian did . Despite having all the clout of Roman imperialism at their disposal and a genuine establishment of empire-wide paganism in recent memory , they could not hope to enact their widespread revival . H/T to Vox Day for this finding from the 1911 Cambridge Medieval History series :
This is what makes Julian such an interesting figure in the history of paganism ; while it in part accounts for their complete failure to do what they attempted . They tried to unite two things which had utterly separate roots , whose ideals were different , and which could not easily blend . For the religion of the Mysteries was essentially a private cult , into which men and women were received , one by one , by rites of initiation which each had to pass through personally , and , when admitted , they became members of coteries , large or small , of like-minded persons . . . . What had this to do with the courteous recognition due to bright celestial beings which was the central thought of the official religion of Greece , or the punctilious performance of ceremonies which was believed to propitiate the sterner deities of Rome ? Mysteries and participation in their rites may exist along with a belief in the necessity and religious value of the public services of a state religion ; but whenever the latter can only be justified , even by its own votaries , on the ground of traditional and patriotic propriety , Mystery worship may take its place but can never quicken it . When the whole piety of paganism disappeared in the Mysteries cult , it estranged itself from the national and official religion ; and the Mysteries could never be used to recall the gods of Olympus for whose banishment they had been largely responsible . . . .
Yet Julian 's attempt to stay the progress of Christianity and to drive back the tide which was submerging the Empire , was , with all its practical faults , by far the ablest yet conceived . It provided a substitute and presented an alternative . The substitute was pretentious and artificial , but it was probably the best that the times could furnish : Hellenism , Julian called it ; but where in that golden past of Hellas into which the Imperial dreamer peered , could be found a puritan strictness of conduct , a prolonged and sustained religious fervour , and a religion independent of the State ? The three strongest parts of their scheme had no connexion with Hellenism . Religions may be used , but can not be created by statesmen , unless they happen to have the prophetic fire and inspiration — and Julian was no prophet . They may be credited with seizing and combining in one whole the strongest anti-Christian forces of their generation — the passion of Oriental religion , the patriotic desire to retain the old religion under which Greece and Rome had grown great , the glory of the ancient literature , the superstition which clung to magic and divinations , and a philosophy which , if it lacked independence of thought , at least represented that eclecticism which was the intellectual atmosphere which all men then breathed . They brought them together to build an edifice which was to be the temple of their Empire . But though the builder had many of the qualities which go to make a religious reformer — pure in heart and life , full of sincere piety , manly and with a strong sense of duty — the edifice they reared was quite artificial , lacked the living principle of growth , and could not last . Athanasius gave its history in four words when they said “ It will soon pass. ” The world had outgrown paganism .
EVGA has been dropping teaser images of an unannounced graphics card all week , but until the last image was released today , we were all simply speculating on what the new product would be . The guesses ranged from a dual GPU GK110 graphics card to a 780 k|ngp|n edition , but with the release of the image today we know the graphics card is in fact a EVGA GeForce GTX 780 Ti Classified edition , which was what we speculated it would be .
EVGA still has some more teaser images coming , as we have yet to fully see the graphics card in all its glory , but the teaser images are giving us at least some idea of what the graphics card will look like and now we can put a name to the teases . The images below are the ones released prior to today 's declassification image .
EVGA released a teaser of an upcoming product on Instagram with a simple caption : “ Designed and engineered by the best… # comingsoon ”
Guess on the site have ranged from a GTX 780 Ti Classified , to a custom dual core graphics card similar to the ASUS GTX 760 Mars Edition . What are your thoughts on what this could be ?
EVGA has just released another tease via Instagram . Check it out below .
Following up on the alleged incident in the Strait of Hormuz with those five Iranian speedboats , remember that radioed threat supposedly coming from the Iranian side ? Now they 're blaming it on  are you ready for this ?  “ the Filipino Monkey , ” some crazy guy ( or guys ) whose obscene remarks have come crackling over ship radios in the area for years .
Notice how quickly the official story is changing . First the transmission was a threat coming from the Iranians : now they 're “ unsure. ” This is contrary to the President 's characterization of what occurred , and the Pentagon 's video presentation of a threat emanating from the speedboats : the allegedly “ aggressive ” actions of the Iranians are underscored by an audio overlay in which a voice interpolates “ I am coming to you , you will explode in a few minutes . ”
The Iranians are calling the US video a fabrication , and it sure does look like that . Yet the Navy Times has another explanation :
“ In recent years , American ships operating in the Middle East have had to contend with a mysterious but profane voice known by the ethnically insulting handle of “ Filipino Monkey , ” likely more than one person , who listens in on ship-to-ship radio traffic and then jumps on the net shouting insults and jabbering vile epithets .
“ Navy women  a helicopter pilot hailing a tanker , for example  who are overheard on the radio are said to suffer particularly degrading treatment . Several Navy ship drivers interviewed by Navy Times are raising the possibility that the Monkey , or an imitator , was indeed featured in that video . ”
The Monkey , in this account , takes on the aura of a legend , alongside Scylla and Charybdis :
“ Rick Hoffman , a retired captain who commanded the cruiser Hue City and spent many of their 17 years at sea in the Gulf was subject to the renegade radio talker repeatedly , often without pause during the so-called ‘ Tanker Wars ' of the late 1980s . ‘ For 25 years there 's been this mythical guy out there who , hour after hour , shouts obscenities and threats , ' they said . ‘ He could be tied up pierside somewhere or they could be on the bridge of a merchant ship . ' And the Monkey has stamina . ‘ He used to go all night long . The guy is crazy , ' they said . ‘ But who knows how many Filipino Monkeys there are ? Could it have been a spurious transmission ? Absolutely . ' ”
Spurious is right . According to this guy , there is no Filipino Monkey :
“ First of all any seaman , military or commercial , can tell you their is no heckler know as the “ Filipino Monkey “ . Rather it 's a phrase that 's been uttered by thousands of mariners for decades . This harassing radio call with racial origins is made over the radio when a sailor hears the distinct accent of a Filipino mariner on the VHF radio . Why is it said ? Mostly out of boredom but also for the simple reason that it is sure to get a heated response .
“ Initially I was shocked that a Navy ship , or any ship , could not have known the taunt was a joke . This is seamanship 101 . I clearly remember having the taunt whispered in my ear by an upperclassman during my plebe year that the Naval Academy and by the time I received my officers license I had heard it hundreds of time . How could the officers of the cruiser Port Royal not know this was a common joke ? I 'm admitting still confused but after hearing the audio file I must say it does n't sound like the typical ‘ Filipino Monkey ' taunt . ”
Oh , and look over here , at this Los Angeles Times story from November 12 , 1987 :
“ A cargo ship was sailing through the Strait of Hormuz recently when it was challenged by an Iranian warship demanding to know what it carried . Iranian gunboats in these waters frequently attack vessels they suspect of carrying war materials to Iraq , and for the crew of the cargo ship , it was a tense moment .
“ ‘ What is your cargo ? What is your cargo ? ' the voice of an Iranian officer crackled over the radio .
“ Before the ship 's captain could respond , a third voice came on the air : ‘ I am carrying machine guns and hand grenades to Iraq . . . and the atom bomb . '
“ The Filipino Monkey had struck again . ”
And again  and again .
The Monkey , the Times tells us , hated Iranians , and told them what they thought of them “ in graphic terms . ”
The return of the Monkey is so very convenient  anything can be attributed to that mischievous imp of the perverse and the profane , including doing the voiceover for a staged Gulf of Tonkin-style “ incident. ” Now , I 'm not saying that this is so , only that several factors raise the possibility . The Navy Times interviewed “ a former skipper ” who “ noted how quiet and clean the radio ‘ threat ' was , especially when radio calls from small boats in the chop are noisy and cluttered . ‘ It 's a tough environment , you 're bouncing around , moving fast , lots of wind , noise . It 's not a serene environment , ' they said . ‘ That sounded like somebody on the beach or a large ship going by . ' ”
A large ship  there are several such in the crowded waterways of the Strait , and surely the American warships are the largest . As for beach  there 's plenty to choose from . There are also plenty of US military bases for a country not quite as big as Kansas : Thumrait Naval Air Base , the Masirah Air Base , and the US Air Force stationed at Seeb International Airport , the sultanate 's main air transport hub . There is also a naval base at Al Khasab , on the Musandam peninsula  the Omani side of the “ beach ” where captain Hoffman thinks the transmission might have come from .
I do n't buy the Monkey narrative : it sounds too much like a cover story to be quite real . Time magazine , too , has its suspicions :
“ There may be a serious problem here . Has the Bush administration 's demonization of Iran so pervaded the U.S. government that the judgement of vital decision-makers is becoming dangerously clouded ? So when a possible practical joker issues a threat to a warship , you have a Strangelovian military chain of command from Bahrain to Washington racing to insist that the crazy , murderous mullahs in Tehran are at it again . ”
The problem may be more serious than Time blogger Scott Macleod , reporting from Cairo , may think , but , in any case , they have lots of questions . They want to know
“ If there was any monkey business involved in how the Pentagon originally spun the sensational kamikaze angle to the press and the global public . How seriously did the officers on the three ships take the suicide-attack threat ? Were they certain that it had been issued by the Iranians ? Did they consider or believe that it could have come from a prankster ? How carefully did the Pentagon analyze the verbal threat once it was relayed back to Washington ? Were officials there completely convinced that the threat came from Iran ? Or did they have doubts yet went ahead anyway and indicated to reporters that Iran did it ? Were officers on the scene and Pentagon officials in Washington aware that pranksters are prevalent on the Gulf radio networks ? Did they factor that into their risk assessment and into their decision to point a quick finger at Iran ? ”
This narrative depends on the authenticity of the Monkey  who may or may not be more than one person  but we have no proof of that , and every reason to disbelieve it . Whoever told the Americans that they were going to explode “ in a few minutes ” was certainly monitoring the scene at sea , perhaps in sight of the encounter : in any case , the voice did not sound Iranian , according to Farsi speakers interviewed by the Washington Post . “ Some have even said the voice sounds more like Borat than a real Iranian , ” quips Editor and Publisher .
Gee , I wonder if they hired an actor to do the voiceover .
No one is saying that the US government , or some subterranean branch of it  perhaps a “ rogue ” faction , as in Iran-Contra  is responsible for what happened in the Strait of Hormuz , where a “ misunderstanding ” almost sparked World War III . However , it 's just possible  given our government 's dismal record in this regard  that we 'll be talking about the Hormuz Hoax , years from now , when the history of this decade of deception is written .
NOTES IN THE MARGIN
I am humbled and grateful for the large number of condolence messages I received about my Mom 's recent death . Thanks to all for your words of comfort and support .

Unearthed grave sheds light on Batavia shipwreck mass murder
Updated
Secrets from one of the nation 's most horrific maritime mass murders have been unearthed on a tiny island off Western Australia 's coast .
A new grave has been discovered almost four centuries after the Batavia was wrecked on Morning Reef , within the Abrolhos Islands .
The Dutch East India vessel was on its maiden voyage when it wrecked with more than 300 people on board .
The survivors managed to swim to the nearby Beacon Island , but about 40 people drowned .
What then played out on the tiny coral outcrop was a 17th-century tale of mutiny and systematic murders of those aboard that inspired movies , books and plays and remained one of the darkest chapters of Australia 's maritime history .
Some of the evidence of the bloodthirsty episode has only now been uncovered , with experts revealing on Tuesday they have found another skeleton , the 11th found on Beacon Island since the 60s .
Two musket balls were found near the body , which was about 1.5 metres underground .
A forensic team was examining the remains and said they were believed to be that of an adolescent .
The WA Museum 's head of maritime archaeology , Jeremy Green , said the find was a major step forward in better understanding what was an internationally significant chapter in history .
`` This was the first time that Europeans lived in Australia — albeit it was n't in the mainland but it was here — so it 's the oldest known European habitation in Australia , '' they said .
`` So it 's got to be important . ''
Human tooth led archaeologists to discovery
A human tooth found on the final day of an expedition at the island in 2013 led archaeologists to examine the same area where they eventually discovered the skeleton .
Mr Green said mutton birds on the island dug down into the ground and brought little items to the surface , which indicated areas of archaeological interest .
Surprisingly , they said it appeared the skeleton was not the owner of the tooth .
`` What 's very interesting is that it looks like that tooth does n't belong to that grave , which means that there 's another grave very close , '' they said .
A mass grave was discovered on Beacon Island in 1999 , but archaeologists had to wait 15 years before old fishermen shacks were removed so they could comb the entire island for clues left behind in 1629 .
Many individuals died , it was a horrendous event ... we would n't expect at all for many of them to survive ... but we 're finding them , so some of them do . UWA Archaeologist Professor Alistair Paterson
The team of researchers was studying the island as part of the Australian Research Council-funded project , led by UWA archaeologist Professor Alistair Paterson .
Professor Paterson said experts travelled from as far away as Holland to help piece together the Batavia story .
`` Obviously it 's a really significant site , not just for Western Australia and the Dutch , but also for Australia ... so we 're pretty excited to see this next phase occurring here , '' they said .
`` Many individuals died , it was a horrendous event , and yet we know many of those people died in the water . Presumably they were disposed of in surface conditions , so we would n't expect at all for many of [ their remains ] to survive ... but we 're finding them , so some of them do . ''
The Batavia was carrying gold and silver when it sailed from Texel for the Dutch East Indies on October 27 , 1628 , to obtain spices .
But the vessel went off course and was wrecked in the Abrolhos on June 4 , 1629 .
A total of 180 people – among them 30 women and children – were ferried off the ship , while about 70 men remained .
According to the WA Museum , the survivors landed on Beacon Island .
Some , including the ship 's captain , navigated a longboat to Java to find help after it became clear they could not survive long on what was left of the ship 's provisions .
Undermerchant Jeronimus Cornelisz assumed charge of the group , and began picking off survivors , by sending them in search of water on nearby islands , where they thought they would not survive .
Their men drowned many others .
They also murdered women and children , the ill and infirm . They kept a number of women alive to subject to repeated rapes .
They were eventually overcome by a force they had sent to one of the islands , as they tried to lure them into a trap .
When the captain returned to the site of the shipwreck , they sentenced the mutineers to having their right hands chopped off , then put them to death on the gallows .
Some of the lesser offenders were returned to Holland , while another two men were left stranded on the mainland as punishment .
Professor Paterson said the chapter in history needed more recognition .
`` I still think that we 've got some way to go to realise the importance of this and other Dutch sites in Western Australia , '' they said .
`` West Australians know the story really well , particularly in Geraldton and other places , but I think there 's a lot more of that story to be picked up elsewhere in the country . ''

Ben Jealous , 44 , Democratic gubernatorial candidate 2018 , sat down for an interview with the AFRO July 16 in Baltimore 's Inner Harbor .
Jealous , a Rhodes scholar and long-time activist , is now an entrepreneur with Kapor Capital .
Jealous , a former NAACP national leader , has also worked as a reporter and executive director of the National Newspapers Publishers Association , a federation of Black newspapers and still serves as a board member of the AFRO .
Jealous , born in California , was asked about their connection with Baltimore .
“ My mom grew up in the NAACP here , ” said Jealous . “ Jeez , I 'm the fourth generation in my family to attend St. James Episcopal Church , Lafayette Square . That 's where I was baptized , my mom was baptized , my son was baptized . ”
Jealous ' mother , Ann Todd Jealous , at 12 years old , sued Western High School for Girls for the right to attend the then segregated school . Western eventually desegregated when they were 15 . They met a fellow organizer , Fred Jealous , when they both taught at Harlem Park Junior High years later .
Marriage between Ann and Fred , a Black woman and a White man , was a criminal act in Maryland at the time . They married in Washington , DC .
“ I always joke it 's better that the landmark decision be Loving v. Virginia that Jealous v. Maryland , ” Jealous said . “ It was illegal for them to cohabitate as husband and wife here , just like the Lovings in Virginia , they had to live in fear of the sheriff or the police breaking into their house . ”
That fear is what drove Jealous ' family to California . Ben was born in Pacific Grove .
“ I was shipped back here every summer , ” said Jealous . “ I knew where we were from and maintained connection to the family . I would tell folks that being a child of the 70s and 80s were the years where Baltimore was really falling apart . Deindustrialization , rise of hardcore drugs and hardcore violence and the crack years really get started around ‘ 87 . My childhood is right in between . ”
The candidate reminisced about the unique culture of Pulaski Street , where their cousins lived at the time .
“ Saturdays , they were washing down the marble steps with bleach ” Jealous said . “ Friday nights , a young man was singing a cappella on the corner . All that sort of thing . You 've got to really love West Baltimore to keep coming back when things are falling apart . ”
The AFRO asked the candidate what the candidate has learned from the last generation of civil rights activists in an environment of encroaching retrenchment .
“ What that teaches you , is that our country is a country that often takes a step back and then will respond by taking two steps forward . It 's always darkest before it 's dawn , we go down in order to go up higher . And I believe we 're living through one of those moments right now . We are on the verge of becoming a nation where every group is a minority . Where we all have to get along with one and other groups demographically in order to succeed democratically . ”
When it comes to democratic , big and little “ D , ” success , the Republican incumbent , Larry Hogan is up against a number of structural and statistical hurdles . The last two-term Republican governor was Theodore Roosevelt McKeldin who left office in 1959 .
“ If you look at McKeldin , what 's interesting is that they were elected at a time when Republicans were able to build multi-racial , multi-class coalitions that included significant numbers of union members and Black voters , ” Jealous said . “ The Republicans are almost incapable of doing that now . They may get some folks from the more conservative unions , but they lose them overwhelmingly and few Blacks will vote for them . They have isolated themselves . ”
Ben Jealous recently secured the endorsement of the American Postal Workers Union .
McKeldin famously stated “ ” I rode by train over several state borders . I carried no passports . No one asked me to identify myself . No one had the right to . This is America . ”
Jealous was asked to compare this attitude with Hogan 's resistance to the concepts of sanctuary states and cities and fears across throughout Baltimore City and the state of ICE aggression .
“ It 's easy to prey on people 's fears , it 's easy to pit them against each other , it also profoundly destructive and short sighted , ” Jealous said .
The candidate said they see a clear way to Annapolis .
“ Hogan won by 63,000 votes in a year when 125,000 Democrats did not turn out , ” Jealous said . “ These were not unlikely voters , these were the most likely voters . ”
Jealous has repeated often how their dramatic turnaround of NAACP membership from the hundreds of thousands to the millions , proves them well suited to turning out voters on election days .
“ I get very excited because , throughout my career as an organizer , starting at age 14 with the Jesse Jackson campaign , 2012 with the reelection of Barack Obama , what I 've excelled in is building teams that turn out unlikely voters , ” said Jealous . “ We can defeat Hogan just on likely voters . We will wallop them with unlikely voters . ”
Hogan announced their candidacy in June . They are expected to run unchallenged for the Republican ticket next year . Jealous is facing a Democratic primary with four candidates , including Prince George 's County Executive Rushern Baker , III so far . In addition , Maya Rockeymoore Cummings , wife of Congressman Elijah Cummings , and Baltimore County Executive Kevin Kamenetz are strongly considering entering the race .
There has been a back-and-forth battle in recent weeks about what is causing the internet congestion that is degrading service to Netflix consumers . Last week Verizon published a blog post that offered the first real specifics in the debate , saying that it had studied the situation closely based on a customer in Los Angeles and found that there was plenty of capacity available at different points where Netflix could deliver traffic to its network . The congestion , Verizon said , was being caused by Netflix , which had made the decision to send all its data over a limited set of very crowded routes . Today , Level 3 — which helps carry that Netflix traffic to Verizon 's network in LA — fired back in a blog post of its own . It says the problem could be solved in five minutes and for a very small cost , but that Verizon is refusing to make these upgrades , because it wants to extract a fee from Level 3 instead .
In essence , Verizon 's story matches up pretty well with the one being pushed by Netflix and Level 3 . It 's saying that Netflix traffic has overwhelmed the points of connection between the ISP and the middlemen who deliver this data for the streaming video giant . The key difference is that Verizon says Netflix could solve this problem easily by spreading its traffic over multiple transit providers . Level 3 is arguing that the best solution would be to simply upgrade Verizon 's network , a process it claims to have offered to pay for .
`` We could fix this congestion in about five minutes . ''
`` We could fix this congestion in about five minutes simply by connecting up more 10Gbps ports on those routers , '' wrote Level 3 's Mark Taylor . `` [ It 's something ] we 've been asking Verizon to do for many , many months , and something other providers regularly do in similar circumstances . But Verizon has refused ... Maybe they ca n't afford a new port card because they 've run out — even though these cards are very cheap , just a few thousand dollars for each 10Gbps card which could support 5,000 streams or more . If that 's the case , we 'll buy one for them . Maybe they ca n't afford the small piece of cable between our two ports . If that 's the case , we 'll provide it . Heck , we 'll even install it . ''
Netflix offered a similar line of reasoning when it asked to place its Open Connect system on the ISPs ' network to help alleviate congestion . The real issue for the ISPs , however , is not the cost of the equipment , but so-called peering arrangements that specify a certain exchange of traffic back and forth between two network companies . Right now those are `` settlement-free '' arrangements , meaning Level 3 and Verizon do n't exchange any money . Verizon wo n't allow new hardware to be bought and installed , even if Level 3 pays for it , because it believes allowing significantly more traffic onto its network would be an ongoing cost that it should be compensated for .
`` Maybe they ca n't afford a new port card because they 've run out . ''
And in the end , Verizon will likely get its way . Netflix has agreed to pay it for a direct interconnect and Verizon says it will finish installing those upgrades by the end of the year . If that happens , the congestion between Level 3 and Verizon may resolve itself as well . That direct interconnect essentially mimics the installation of new router ports and wiring that Taylor suggests — so in the end , Verizon is accepting the idea that its network should be upgraded and someone else should pay . It wants that payment to come in the form of fees , however , and to handle any construction on its network itself .
stop meddling with pvt schools set house in order hc to delhi govt
New Delhi : Flaying the Aam Aadmi Party government in Delhi for meddling in the affairs of private unaided schools , the Delhi High Court on Monday said that the AAP government should first `` set its house in order '' by administering public schools and improving them instead of trying to `` take over '' the admission process of private schools .
`` Those people ( government ) who ca n't administer a public school are trying to take over admissions of private schools , ” the HC said reprimanding the AAP government and censured the government for its failure to improve the condition of public schools .
`` Please set your house in order . Then there would be no reason for people to rush to private schools , '' Justice Manmohan said , citing the poor state of public schools as the major reason behind the problem .
“ One major reason for all this is the poor state of public schools . No one is addressing that issue , ” they observed while issuing notice to the Delhi government and asking it to respond to the pleas by private schools seeking quashing of government 's January 6 order scrapping 62 criteria , including management quota , for nursery admissions .
During the hearing , the court said that the government can not take away the autonomy of private schools , especially by an office order which has not been passed under any statutory provision .
In its November 28 , 2014 verdict scrapping the point system of nursery admissions devised by the Lt Governor for private unaided schools , the court had also asked the government to amend the statute .
`` But you do nothing and come out with another office order . Why do you ( government ) do it at the last moment , '' it asked .
To this , Delhi government said it had asked schools to upload the criteria by December 8 last year but they did so by December end .
The court directed the government to file its response in a week and listed the matter for hearing on January 28 .
The court also expressed doubts over scrapping of all 62 criteria , except for some like quotas for children whose parents were vegetarians , non-alcoholics or non-smokers .
“ Such criteria , if being implemented by any private school for admissions , amounts to maladministration , ” the court said .
It , however , clarified that parents as of now can apply even as per the 62 criteria , but `` scrutiny of applications would be subject to final orders '' in the petitions by Forum for Promotion of Quality Education and Action Committee of Unaided Recognized Private Schools .
The two associations , which represent a number of private unaided schools in the national capital , contended that the government can not take away their autonomy with regard to nursery admissions when the same has been upheld by the high court and the Supreme Court .
They said they were not trying to champion the cause of all the scrapped 62 criteria , except a few like management quota . The school bodies also contended that when the high court 's earlier verdict had not been set aside , how could the government come out with the January 6 order .
The pleas filed by the associations has sought quashing of the AAP government 's decision to scrap management and other quotas , except for the Economically Weaker Sections ( EWS ) in the city 's private schools , saying the `` order is absolutely without jurisdiction and is thus , liable to be quashed '' .
Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal had on January 6 called the management quota the breeding ground for `` biggest scandal '' in the education sector and said their government will not be a `` mute spectator '' to it .
The AAP government had also scrapped 62 `` arbitrary and discriminatory '' criteria listed by schools on their websites for admissions , but retained the 25 per cent quota for EWS .
Earlier , the high court , in an order , had asked the Delhi government not to micro-manage the admission process following which Education Department had allowed the schools to frame their respective criteria and put them on their websites .

The blue-green algae , the cyanobacteria–sometimes toxic— that we first saw in aerial photos over Lake Okeechobee weeks ago , is not only here , it is everywhere…our river has been made completely fresh by our government . Now the algae is blooming fluorescent green-blue , dying a putrid brown-green , flowing out of our inlet , and poisoning not only or rivers ' shores but our beaches .
On the widest level , this is a health hazard brought upon us by a “ knowing government. ” Our state , federal , and local governments have seen this coming for years . The slow and steady destruction of the St Lucie River/Indian River Lagoon is well documented .
The St Lucie River was first declared “ impaired ” by the state of Florida in the year 2002 . I have been blogging about this for four years .
( http : //www.dep.state.fl.us/southeast/ecosum/ecosums/SLE_Impairment_Narrative_ver_3.7.pdf )
Now , in 2016 , all of Martin County 's beaches and the southern most beach of St Lucie County are closed . Palm City ; Stuart ; Rio ; Sewall 's Point , Jensen . All waters are off limits . “ Do n't Touch the Water. ” –A health , safety and welfare issue for the people , a nightmare for local government , and a complete environmental and economic disaster for us all .

One of the co-owners of the Charlotte Hornets basketball team is livid over the National Basketball Association 's decision to strip the North Carolina city of next year 's All-Star game , because of its hateful law , House Bill 2 .
“ NOT FAIR FOR OUR COMMUNITY TO BE PENALIZED , ” wrote Felix Sabates , in a “ reply-all ” email to other members of the ownership group that was full of vitriol , a few all-caps rants , and enough misspellings to suggest the Cuban native might struggle with the English language . “ Shame on those responsible for such a short sighted decision to take the NBA All Star away from Charlotte I always thought this was country that ALL peoples not just a few can determine our future , ” they wrote , according to the Charlotte Observer .
Sabates , one of the founding owners of the team and a successful business person who built themselves up from nothing after arriving in the U.S. at the age of 15 , complained in their email that “ 21 other USA states are suing the Federal Government over laws that are not fair to our communities , ” referring to the lawsuits filed by governors upset over directives by the federal government for schools to treat transgender students as equals .
The directive followed the enacting of HB2 by North Carolina , which restricts the use of public bathrooms : under the law , everyone must use the bathroom matching the gender listed on their birth certificate . The law reversed a Charlotte ordinance that added lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender people to the list of classes of people protected against discrimination in the city , which Sabates blamed for the league 's decision .
“ I am very disappointed in this decision by the commissioner , it hurts our team and ownership group that has suffered very deep financial loses ( sic ) over the years , ” Sabates said .
“ Our Mayor opened a can of worms , who knows why ? Our city council is the one to blame for our losing the NBA All Star game , none of this would have happened if not for a very few minorities forcing our supposed city leaders into creating a problem that never really existed , there will always be another election , they better pray a very few can get them re-elected . ”
Sabates claims in their email that they are “ not opposed to people changing their sex , ” using words that suggest they do n't really understand what being transgender is , but then reveals their true feelings about the trans community later in their email :
“ What is wrong with a person using a bathroom provided for the sex they were born with , if you want to change your gender so be it , we are a free county , but do n't force 8 years old children to be exposed to having to share bathroom facilities with people that do n't share the organs they were Bourne ( sic ) with , this is plain wrong , this could cause irreparable damages to a children 's that do n't understand why they have to see what God did not mean for them to witness , we have some very confused business as well as political humans that frankly have made this a political issue rather then ( sic ) moral issues , SHAME ON THEM . ”
That message stands in stark contrast to the statement by the team and chairperson Michael Jordan , issued just minutes after the league announced its move of the All-Star game .
“ We understand the NBA 's decision and the challenges around holding the NBA All-Star Game in Charlotte this season . There was an exhaustive effort from all parties to keep the event in Charlotte , and we are disappointed we were unable to do so . With that said , we are pleased that the NBA opened the door for Charlotte to host All-Star Weekend again as soon as an opportunity was available in 2019 . We want to thank the City of Charlotte and the business community for their backing throughout this entire process , starting with the initial bid . We are confident that they will be just as supportive and enthusiastic for the 2019 NBA All-Star Game . ”

JERUSALEM — At least one rocket fired from the Sinai Peninsula in Egypt struck the southern Israeli resort city of Eilat overnight , causing alarm but no injuries , police officials said on Thursday .
Residents reported hearing several explosions shortly after midnight , and bomb-disposal experts located one rocket that fell in an open area close to buildings in a residential neighborhood .
Israeli security officials have been warning for some time about a growing threat from Sinai . They point to an erosion of Egyptian authority there , particularly in the year since the Egyptian revolution . They also cite increased efforts by Palestinian militant groups emanating from Gaza , as well as global jihadi cells , to use the vast expanses of desert as a staging ground for a new front against Israel . The rocket attack came just before the Passover holiday , traditionally one of the busiest seasons in Eilat , which is popular with Israeli and foreign tourists .
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Thursday that the Sinai Peninsula “ has become a terrorism zone . ”

“ We are dealing with this , ” Mr. Netanyahu said . “ We are building a security fence , but it will not stop missiles. ” They added , “ We will strike at those who attack us . ”
MINNEAPOLIS -- Last year , the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) held the first of three public workshops to gather scientific information about electronic cigarettes and the public health . The FDA has announced that the second workshop will be held on March 9-10 , 2015 .
The agenda for the March 2015 e-cigarette workshop focuses on the impact of e-cigarettes on a person 's individual health . The specific topics to be discussed include , ( 1 ) exposure to nicotine and toxicological considerations ; ( 2 ) pharmacokinetics ( the movement of drugs within the body ) and pharmacodynamics ( the effects of drugs ) regarding nicotine exposure in users ; ( 3 ) abuse and dependence ; ( 4 ) short- and long-term health effects of using e-cigarettes ; ( 5 ) considerations for high-risk or vulnerable populations ; and ( 6 ) human factors .
The information obtained through this series of workshops will not impact the FDA 's pending deeming regulations . If the deeming rule is finalized as proposed , then e-cigarettes would be subject to FDA regulations and the agency could use the scientific information obtained from the series of workshops to propose additional regulations on e-cigarettes .
Even though the FDA has not yet finalized the deeming regulations to formalize its authority to regulate e-cigarettes , these workshops are intended to provide more information about e-cigarettes to the FDA now so that the agency does not need to wait until after the deeming regulations are finalized to gather more scientific data .
The first workshop held by the FDA on e-cigarettes covered the topics of product science , protective packaging , labeling , and the environmental impact . The agency plans to follow up this second workshop with a final workshop that will address the impact of e-cigarettes on the population , including discussions of product appeal ( e.g. , impact of advertising , marketing , flavorings , consumer perceptions ) , impact on nonusers ( second- and third-hand exposures ) , and product labeling .
If you wish to attend the workshop in person or by a webcast , you need to register by submitting either an electronic or written request no later than February 20 , 2015 . You can sign up on-line by clicking here .

7 . Moving on from Vadim
Not every first-year club can step in and compete , and if one of this year 's two expansionists was going to flop , it was going to be Minnesota United FC . The Loons ' frugal approach to roster-building did n't promise much , and , for the most part , they 've lived up to expectations .
There have been some pluses -- Christian Ramirez up front , Abu Danladi 's growth , Francisco Calvo 's emergence , the trades to bring in Sam Cronin and Ethan Finlay -- and they 've mostly been competitive since the disastrous start . But who honestly thought , four weeks into the season , this group might win seven games ?
The poster child for that early-season debacle was 30-year-old , Latvia-born Norwegian centerback Vadim Demidov . He 's the club 's best-paid player , its most prominent import and a TAM-level signing who was charged to anchor the backline . Heath even made them captain . Minnesota got three grisly games out of him , with 16 goals conceded , before March was done .
Demidov has not seen the field since , and there 's been talk they were headed back to Norway . Except the Loons ca n't find a buyer .
6 . D.C. United 's constant rollercoaster
There 's no more schizophrenic team than D.C. United . In the eight seasons under Ben Olsen , D.C. has gone from worst in MLS to competing for Supporters ' Shields and back again . From 2012 through 2014 , the capital 's side 's victory total dropped from 17 to three then rose back to 17 again .
Last year , United went nearly three months with just one loss to push into the playoffs , using a four-game winning streak to climb to fourth . Ben 's boys have been back to the East 's worst again this year and have n't escaped the conference basement since July 1 . United has tallied just 23 times in 28 games -- nobody in MLS has scored fewer -- while giving up twice as many goals .
None of this has endangered Olsen 's status . The message from the top : He 's done as well as they can with what they have . The club 's priority has been finding a site for a stadium , getting everything approved , and building the thing . Audi Field is meant to be a game-changer when it opens next year . That 's when things will really start to count .
There already are good signs : The additions of Paul Arriola , Russell Canouse and Zoltan Stieber during the summer transfer window has made D.C. a more fearsome side , although it wo n't mean all that much until 2018 .
5 . Sporting losing Palmer-Brown for nothing
There are two recommended uses for superbly talented young players . One , play them . Two , sell them for a tidy profit . It 's how it works all over the world , and we 're sure to increasingly see that here as MLS soldiers on .
Within that prism , Erik Palmer-Brown 's tenure with Sporting Kansas City has been disastrous . The 20-year-old center back 's decision to leave for Manchester City , with K.C . receiving no compensation , is an epic failure for the club and the league .
Palmer-Brown is among the most prized young Americans the game has seen . The U.S. U-20 captain 's potential is off the charts , but he 's not ready to supplant Matt Besler or Ike Opara on the K.C . backline , so he 's seen little time for Peter Vermes : just 370 minutes this year .
Sporting turned down Juventus ' offer a few years back , and its hopes fell through to sell Palmer-Brown to FC Porto after they helped the club 's B side win Portugal 's second-tier title while on loan last year . With less than six months to go on their MLS contract , they can sign a pre-contract elsewhere , no fee required , and Manchester City bested Paris Saint-Germain , among others , for their signature . It 's basically a giveaway .
He 's not going to play right away for the Citizens , of course , and the Netherlands ' NAC Breda seems the likeliest loan destination . At least Sporting retains their MLS rights , right ?
4 . The freefall of FC Dallas
FC Dallas was streaking toward an unprecedented treble until Mauro Diaz 's torn Achilles last season , but the Hoops ' start to this MLS campaign suggested they 'd figured out how to play without their one indispensable player .
Recommended How revered FC Dallas slipped into its state of vulnerability
Then Diaz came back . Not at full strength , of course -- it takes time to find fitness , form , that velvet touch after so long a layoff -- but in short stints , leading to a start in late June and , a hamstring ailment aside , regular time after that .
That 's only part of the why the Hoops are in a tailspin . Their winless skid reached eight games in Sunday 's embarrassing 3-0 loss at Atlanta United , and suddenly they 're 9-8-7 , seven points off the Western lead and officially eliminated from the Supporters ' Shield race . Things are going wrong at the back , especially against the high-pressure attacks , but its inability to find the proper chemistry with its talisman is the most frustrating .
The club went with a 4-4-2 alignment during Diaz 's absence but have reverted to the 4-2-3-1 with their return , and the chemistry just is n't there . Diaz is only now starting to find their game again , but Maxi Urruti has n't been at their best , and Cristian Colman has been a $ 2 million bust .

I 've changed many things in my software development workflow over the past year or so . I 've tweeted about bits and parts of it . There is one thing change that stands out above all else . I started to use make and it changed everything about how I build and test my software .
It all started by using docker exclusively . This required a new workflow that I had n't encountered before . I needed a binary based tool ( read : no language stack required ) , could map files to other files ( e.g . these files are used in this Dockerfile ) , and could run arbitrary commands as part of the wider development workflow . I also wanted something simple so I could create a similar development experience across all projects ( e.g . there is a similar workflow for building the project and running its tests ) . Naturally this is a solved problem . Make solved it some 30 years ago .
Make is a tool for building projects -- most commonly for compiled languages like C. The Makefile declares the rules for producing files and dependencies between files . For example you can have a rule that * .c should produce * .o to create a complex graph . Make also provides functionality to execute arbitrary tasks that do not produce any files ( e.g make install ) . Together make has enough proven functionality to handle most projects .
Changes happened slowly . First I needed something to handle building multiple docker images . This was before docker introduced docker build -f . Turns out with a pattern rule and symlinks solved it easily . make images/app would take the appropriate file from dockerfiles/app and coordinate the process in the root folder . Then I need something to pull dependencies and setup the environment . make environment took care of that . Things really started rocking as I iterated on a generic Makefile .
Then something strange and interesting started . I started to use make to launch docker containers as part of the environment target . I combined those with -d & -- name , save container ids to a file with a redirect and voilla . There 's a way to start long running processes with a single command . This is not a revolutionary idea but it allowed me to do things I 'd never done before . I think docker is also responsible because -d makes it simple to manage ( start/stop ) processes . I started to see the entire codebase as processes and only processes . Processes have their owned defined public interfaces ( ports ) and can be tested as such . Naturally it would be possible to start another process that could communicate over the public interface as a smoke tests . Does the process speak HTTP ? Great , fire some curl commands . Does the process speak thrift ? Great , start a thrift client and make some RPCs . Does the code base have some CLI utils to go with it ? Great , then write a make target to call those things .
This unrelated workflow change has completely changed how I view my software and the verification of process deliverables . This is something I never expected . I stopped thinking in a whitebox and shifted to more on black box deliverables . There are only so many things you can do if you only focus on internals . If you never start the process and communicate with it your testing is a lie -- pure and simple . These workflows have also drastically increased software quality more than anything I 've done since I started doing TDD .
At this point my workflow goes like this :
make dependencies - build any dependencies ( may pull down external libraries , compile things , or anything like that ) make - build the project make environment - build the project ; start processes delivered by the project and any other long running processes needed in development make test - quick unit tests ; should execute as quickly as possible and may not by exhaustive make test-ci - run every possible test make clean - remove project artifacts and stop anything
Then there are various other test targets . Ruby projects always have make test-boot . This actually start the process in a given environment . If the process has some CLI utils there is make test-cli . The list goes on and depending on the project .
This workflow dramatically increased my work quality . I suggest you look into these things as well . They may be as transformative for you as they are for me .
If you want concrete examples , then wait for the next post . That post is about replacing rake with make for great good .
The first failure : There 's still no coherent agenda .
The purpose of these joint-session speeches is not , actually , to reassure the president 's base that the leader of the country is mentally well . The purpose of the speeches is to mobilize support in Congress and the country for the president 's legislative plans . President George W. Bush 's 2001 address argued for their tax cut . Barack Obama 's in 2009 defended and advanced their recovery program .
Donald Trump omitted to do anything like that . On every one of the issues dividing House from Senate Republicans—tax reform , healthcare , immigration—Trump avoided so much as indicating a preference , let alone leading the way . Their line about Israel-Palestine ( “ I 'm looking at two-state and one-state , and I like the one that both parties like ” ) also seems to apply to the issues before Congress : You guys sort it out .
Health care ? If Obamacare is repealed , millions of people will lose Medicaid coverage , including many Trump voters in states like Ohio and Kentucky . What does the president propose to do about that ? Their answer is contained in one single sentence : “ We should give our great state governors the resources and flexibility they need with Medicaid to make sure no one is left out . ”
Tax reform ? Donald Trump endorsed “ massive tax relief for the middle class. ” No such relief is offered by the various plans circulating in House and Senate . House Speaker Paul Ryan in fact is touting a “ border adjustment tax ” that ( while an elegant solution to inefficiencies created by the present corporate income tax ) would have the side effect of increasing costs of everyday goods like clothing , shoes , and consumer electronics .
Immigration ? Senators Cotton and Perdue have introduced in the Senate exactly the kind of immigration reform Trump supposedly favors . Its most important feature—lowering the absolute level of immigration—went undiscussed .
Infrastructure ? Trump said they would soon ask Congress for a $ 1 trillion public-private program . How would it work ? What would it do ? Why should Americans support him ? All went unargued .
As Paul Ryan told Today 's Matt Lauer on the morning of the speech , Trump acts more like a chairperson than a president , assigning the real work of leadership to others . The trouble is , the system can not work that way . Without presidential leadership , House and Senate Republicans can not agree , laws will not pass , and entropy will win . The February 28 speech ominously indicated that leadership continues to be unforthcoming .
The second failure : There 's still no plan to build a majority coalition to support a Trump program .
Donald Trump 's fierce need for approval has disabled them from acknowledging the strategic fact of majority disapproval . Fifty-six percent disapproval is not an insurmountable obstacle . But how can a leader surmount a difficulty that they insist does not exist ?
This morning on Fox & Friends , the program 's hosts , two couch potatoes and one couch tomato , introduced a video that purported to examine “ Four Years of Hope and Change. ” What it was in reality was a four-plus minute campaign video attacking President Obama that presented a variety of soundbites by the President accompanied by ominous graphics and eerie music that falsely implied that their campaign promises were unkept . The video addresses subject such as…
The national debt ( which ballooned as a result of Bush 's tax cuts for the rich , bailouts for banks , and two wars ) .
The unemployment rate ( which Fox failed to note has fallen from 10.1 to 8.1 , and which was the result of an economic collapse precipitated by Bush 's pandering to , and deregulation of , Wall Street ) .
The price of gas ( which at $ 3.63 a gallon is still lower ( and falling ) than at the height of the Bush administration when it reached $ 4.12 ) .
And a variety of statistics that one would expect in a recession that were caused by the economic mismanagement enumerated above .
The video ( which Media Matters thoroughly debunks here ) could not have been a more pro-Romney , anti-Obama attack had it been produced by the Republican National Committee . When critics observe that Fox News is the PR arm of the GOP , it is precisely because of brazenly biased political activism like this . If there were ever a time for Fox News to be investigated by the Federal Elections Commission for improper political contributions , it is now .
Apparently Fox News has also recognized the gross inappropriateness of their anti-Obama attack ad . Minutes after the video was posted online it was removed from every place it had been posted . On Fox Nation a reader would have been greeted by a “ Lost at Sea ” page indicating that the content was no longer at that address . On the Fox & Friends site the video was replaced by an error message saying that they “ were unable to play the media you selected. ” What could have prompted Fox to bury their own video that had already been broadcast on the air ?
Approximately an hour later the video reappeared on Fox Nation . However , it had been edited to remove all of the footage of the Fox & Friends crew introducing it and summing up at the conclusion . It 's almost as if Fox were trying to destroy any evidence of their involvement with the video .
Unfortunately for the propagandists at Fox , the evidence persists . Media Matters captured the whole production and made it available for all to see :
It was nice of the Fox Friends to credit the video 's producer , Chris White , for the fine job of partisan obfuscation they had done . Steve Doocy beamed , “ No kidding . They remembered everything everybody said over the last three and a half , four years. ” Well , actually they only remembered to piece together random bits from Obama 's speeches juxtaposed with negative graphics and false conclusions .
This should put an end to any talk that Fox News has been trying to moderate their bias , as some pundits suggested last year . Fox has n't changed at all . They are just as committed to falsifying their reporting , promoting their far-right agenda , and making imbecilic drones of their audience , as they ever were . This video would be ample evidence of that all by itself , but add to the mix Fox 's attempt to surgically excise their responsibility for it and you know all you need to know about their deceitful and dangerous intent .
Update : 2:30 : The video has mysteriously disappeared again from the Fox web sites .
Update : 3:40 : Now information is emerging that Fox News has been taking considerable heat for their bad behavior . It appears that the video has been disappeared by Fox . A weaselly statement was issued by Fox EVP Bill Shine who said…
“ The package that aired on FOX & Friends was created by an associate producer and was not authorized at the senior executive level of the network . This has been addressed with the show 's producers . ”
One has to wonder what happened to Fox 's “ Zero Tolerance ” policy that was instituted after a series of stupid mistakes . Now it seems that Fox is merely scapegoating an underling despite the glowing treatment that the Fox Friends gave the video and their effusive praise for the producer . The New York Times is reporting that Fox CEO Roger Ailes “ was not aware of the video ” even though they have previously taken a keen interest in the program . However , a lot of people were aware of this video because it was not only broadcast on air , it was posted to several sites online .
A few weeks ago a couple of NBC employees misleadingly edited an audio tape of George Zimmerman 's call to 911 . NBC fired them and announced it publicly . Do n't expect the same from Fox . They do n't bother with trivialities like journalistic ethics . All they will do is say that it 's been addressed and then probably give the producer a bonus . That 's how Roger Ailes can make the ludicrous claim that “ in 15 years we have never taken a story down because it was wrong . ”
There is no way that Fox can avoid responsibility for this atrociously unethical affair . By now it is so obvious that Fox exists to promote Republicans and bash Democrats that this video fits squarely within their mission . The only difference this time is that they got caught crossing a line that they obviously were n't worried about . That 's because they are so comfortable wandering across it that they 've lost all cognizance of the line 's existence .
Pro wrestling fans and writers had questioned World Wrestling Entertainment for several weeks after the disappearance of one of its lead announcers from television , Mauro Ranallo , who was suffering from depression .
Dave Meltzer of The Wrestling Observer said Ranallo may have been the victim of WWE 's bullying culture , particularly John Layfield , their color commentator who made disparaging remarks about Ranallo following their absence on TV and during an out-of-character segment on the company 's streaming network .
The allegations became more rampant after the release of “ Best Seat in The House , ” a book by former WWE ring announcer Justin Roberts . Roberts alleged Layfield bullied them and others regularly , particularly announcers . This behavior and culture was not only tolerated but encouraged by WWE owner Vince McMahon .
ESPN started covering WWE regularly last year , launching its own pro wrestling section on its website , and with a weekly SportsCenter segment by ESPN anchor Jonathan Coachman , a former WWE announcer himself .
ESPN has been questioned for its involvement with WWE , especially its reluctance to cover negative news about the company , almost to the point of sticking to storyline-esque interviews on its programming . The questioning began heating up over the weekend when the story bullying story began to go viral . When asked in a tweet if ESPN would cover the controversy , wrestling journalist Meltzer replied expressing doubt in strong language .
ESPN gets chance after chance to show balls but this will be another time they 're showing castration tendencies . https : //t.co/nk9SREhSqi — Dave Meltzer ( @ davemeltzerWON ) April 7 , 2017
Coachman was n't involved in the discussion , but entered the fray anyway with a shot at Meltzer .
Good one . Ever watch your own morning shows ? An announcer missing for a month is a rumor ? https : //t.co/V4E7F5ubKG — Dave Meltzer ( @ davemeltzerWON ) April 7 , 2017
Reporting on a topic and actual details of a story two different things . Do you know how many this `` story '' came up at mania ... zero .. https : //t.co/FoPt1ER8Yq — Jonathan Coachman ( @ TheCoachESPN ) April 7 , 2017
Zero ? It was a leading topic of conversation from people in the industry all weekend long . Has been for weeks . https : //t.co/C3ghB1n9Qt — Dave Meltzer ( @ davemeltzerWON ) April 8 , 2017
the guy has been gone for 4 weeks , that 's news not speculation . This story has n't been about speculation from day one . https : //t.co/YuduUS7CZg — Dave Meltzer ( @ davemeltzerWON ) April 8 , 2017
Ask him . He 'll make it clear they do n't think with that level of depth . https : //t.co/FbVpfnth0U — Dave Meltzer ( @ davemeltzerWON ) April 8 , 2017
In the middle of their argument , Coachman announced they were dropping the weekly WWE segment from SportsCenter . They deleted the Tweet later , then said they had been planning on dropping it for several weeks because of other projects , but their timing seemed suspect . They pointed fans toward ESPN 's vertical for pro wrestling and WWE coverage .
We have incredible vertical website . I am sure they will continue their fantastic coverage . Just not me . @ WWEonESPN https : //t.co/GwLD7MqU9o — Jonathan Coachman ( @ TheCoachESPN ) April 8 , 2017
Coachman claims he 's done covering WWE . Exactly how a media figure should react when a legit story involving a fellow announcer breaks . — Dave Meltzer ( @ davemeltzerWON ) April 8 , 2017
Harassing someone with a track record of mental health issues into leaving is celebrity gossip and not real news , got it . https : //t.co/NyqyE0BYvY — Dave Meltzer ( @ davemeltzerWON ) April 8 , 2017
Then why would their announcing partner be gone , and why would so many previous partners contact me to say they suffered same ? https : //t.co/fGX4goVuAj — Dave Meltzer ( @ davemeltzerWON ) April 8 , 2017
ESPN has drawn ire for its news coverage , often for its abundance of debate shows during the morning hours and conflict of interest of having TV deals with the companies it covers . The network dropped a planned fictional show based on a pro football team after criticism from the NFL , then later dropped support of a PBS Frontline documentary on accusations the NFL had covered up concussion issues .
Courser-Gamrat Hearing
Representative Cindy Gamrat and their attorney Mike Nichols addresses the media after a question and answer segment with the House Committee at the State Capitol building in Lansing Tuesday , September 8 , 2015 . ( Danielle Duval | MLive.com )
( Danielle Duval )
LANSING , MI -- Former state Rep. Cindy Gamrat ,
early Friday morning , is running in the special election to fill their old seat . Gamrat , R-Plainwell , is among five candidates who have filed for the 80th District race ahead of the Friday afternoon deadline , according to the Allegan County Clerk 's Office .
Update :
Gamrat and former Rep. Todd Courser ,
in the face of likely expulsion , were accused of misconduct and misusing taxpayer dollars to hide their extramarital affair . Gamrat had requested a formal censure from their colleagues rather than expulsion , saying voters who first elected them should be the ones to decide their political fate . They were just the fourth lawmaker to be expelled in the history of the Michigan Legislature . `` As you can imagine this was an extremely difficult moment for me personally , '' Gamrat wrote in a Sunday post on Facebook , referencing their floor speech before the expulsion vote . `` ... There is so much more to all of this than has been alleged and circulating through the media , and maybe in time the rest of the story will be revealed . '' Pediatric nurse Mary Whiteford , who finished second to Gamrat in the 2014 GOP primary , has also filed to run in the 80th District special election . Other confirmed candidates , all Republicans so far , include Bill Sage , Shannon Szukala and Kevin Travis . Allegan County Commissioner Jim Storey is also expected to run . Courser , R-Lapeer , said Wednesday that they
in the 82nd District special election . They had not filed any paperwork as of Thursday afternoon , according to the Lapeer County Clerk 's Office , and they did not return a call seeking comment . Primaries for both open House seats will take place Nov. 3 , and the general elections will follow on March 8 . Attorney General Bill Schuette and the Michigan State Police are jointly investigating whether Courser and Gamrat broke any laws while in office , as requested Friday by the Michigan House . Schuette had actually launched an investigation Sept. 4 , they told reporters Thursday , saying they had made that decision on their own , not because of any request . `` It 'll be thorough , expansive , without fear or favor , no matter where the chips fall , '' Schuette said of the probe . `` Beyond that , we never comment about the details of an ( ongoing ) investigation .

At some point , those of you following along with the CBA negotiation drama have likely contemplated what you would do if you had control of the reigns . What kind of offer could you present to the NHL to get the season back on track ?
Those of you wanting to explore the scenario a little further are in luck ; I 've created a BoC exclusive `` Choose Your Own Adventure '' game ! In it , you are whisked away to an alternate reality where NHLPA Executive Director Donald Fehr has stepped down . In their place , you have been hired to head the NHLPA and lead them in CBA negotiations , even though you are completely inexperienced and unqualified for the job ( also , have you been drinking ? ) .
You have just been presented with the NHL 's latest offer ( and in this reality , it has not been pulled off the table just yet ) . You have two options : Accept the offer as is , or make a counter-proposal which includes tweaks to the offer the NHL has just handed to you . Good luck !
If you need a completely unnecessary refresher , click here to review the offer tabled by the league on NHLcom . If you like what you see ...
However , if you 're feeling a little more adventures and would like to make some adjustments to the offer in order to make a counter-proposal , review your options below and customize the NHLPA new offer as you see fit !
Remember : If you do n't want to make any changes , use the button above to accept the offer as is .
Build Your Own Counter-Proposal
( When you are finished , click `` Submit Proposal '' at the end of this article . )
Term
The term of the CBA proposed by the league is six years . What would you like the length of the CBA you are proposing to be ?
Keep As NHL Proposes ( 6 Years ) 3 Years 4 Years 5 Years 7 Years 8 Years 9 Years
HRR Accounting
The league 's offer says they will , in theory , keep the existing definitions of Hockey-Related Revenue ( HRR ) , but insists on further negotiations to `` more clearly '' define what counts as HRR ( in practice , it is likely the league will fight to narrow that definition once those negotiations start ) . What would you like to do ?
Accept NHL 's offer to further define HRR
Insist HRR Remains the Same , No Further Negotiations
Expand What Counts as HRR , Meaning More Funds are Shared With Players
Applicable Players ' Share vs Owners Share
The league is offering a 50/50 split in revenue sharing ( a reduction from the players ' current 57 % share ) , and insisting this split take place immediately . How would you like to handle this ?
50/50 ? Sounds good , no questions asked !
Accept 50/50 only if there are no rollbacks to current contracts .
Accept 50/50 , but work down from 57 % to 50 % gradually over the length of the CBA
Do not accept 50/50 , demand players take : %
Players ' Share `` Make Whole '' Provision
The league is offering a provision which has players deferring payments owed to them , to be paid out of their future salaries ( as opposed to the owners paying out the full value of the contracts they signed with players ) .
Reject league 's `` Make Whole '' Provision
There are certainly other aspects of the NHL 's offer to the players to be considered ... but come on , this is a damn text-based game , we do n't have time for all of this . Take another look at your counter-offer . If you are satisfied with it ( and it has at least one change from what the league is offering ) , then go ahead and submit your offer to Gary Bettman and the NHL :

Know where to begin
posttraumaticspacelesbian :
i hope the superabundance of question marks is an indication that you 're aware on some level of how utterly wrong you are .
[ trigger warning : discussion of genitalia and internal organs ]
first of all , when you say “ sex ” i assume you 're talking about what is called “ biological sex ” , “ sexual dimorphism ” , or “ sexual difference. ” specifically what you are trying to state or imply here is the material existence of two categories of bodies : male and female . i 'm gon na guess you 're starting with chromosomes since that 's been considered the ‘ most fundamental ' basis of sex by transmisogynists since at least 1979 .
a sex chromosome is a particular-appearing blob that shows up on a karyotype , or a test involving dyeing and microscopically viewing chromosomes . chromosomes are little blobs of folded up goop that if you spooled it out long enough you would find to be a chain of DNA—which is to say a chain of base pairs ( guanine and cytosine , adenine and thymine ) . what you 're also gon na find in there are histones that the chromatin ( the material of somewhat spooled DNA ) is wrapped around . In addition , you 're gon na find methylation , and all other sorts of little chemicals and particles in there because guess what ? DNA is not a linear coding system . DNA codes in chunks—usually triplets that are usually read as certain amino acids , which then come together to form the building blocks of proteins . but the thing about triplet coding is that it can be very complex . so
AGGCTTATTAGGCTCTA
can for example simultaneously code as
AGG CTT ATT AGG CTC ta
and
a GGC TTA TTA GGC TCT a
and
ag GCT TAT TAG GCT CTA
like just to give you an example . now there are signals indicating how that coding should start , but those signals can move around , or be turned on or off . that 's one of the things methylation is for—it can turn on or off the signals of where to start the coding chain . methylation for any given part of a DNA strand can be triggered by all sorts of things . one study found a linkage between rates of diabetes and levels of stress in the grandmothers of those with diabetes—i.e . the stress was linked to diabetes in the grandchildren . that 's just to give you some idea of the level of complexity of coding .
and the complexities continue at every level . the proteins that are formed by those DNA sequences may come together in different ways depending on the chemical composition of their environment . the DNA itself—a three-dimensional object in the same environment—may physically interact with the proteins or with itself . but also remember that we are talking about chemical goop subject to environmental conditions , which include all sorts of mutagens . sometimes shit just goes weird ( not gon na say ‘ wrong ' because that presumes that mutations are ‘ bad ' which is bullshit given the necessity of mutation for genetic adaptability—also it means applying anthropocentric notions of functionality , of ‘ good ' and ‘ bad ' behavior , to goop ) and AGG CTT ATT loses a letter and becomes AGC TTA tt ( this is what 's called a frameshift mutation—you can also have other stuff like point mutations ) . also , things can just go weird when the DNA is being replicated—it 's not a perfect reading process , it 's a bunch of chemical reactions floating in goop . and it 's happening millions of times , so the likelihood that things will go wrong in various ways is high .
but even above the level of the DNA coding , on the level of the chromosomes , things are confusing . because the chromosomes come together out of more loosely distributed goop when the cell is splitting , and things can go wrong in that process—get misplaced , get shuffled over to the other side , etc . likewise , there 's a process called crossing-over that occurs at cell replication during metaphase ( while the chromosomes are paired at the center of the cell prior to the nucleus dividing ) where chromosomes just swap shit around for the heck of it . and it 's pretty random where this happens too , which can mean that important codes just get cut in half , or new codes get created .
all of which is leading to say that it 's incredibly unlikely to expect any sort of meaningful fifty-fifty split between “ XX chromosomes ” and “ XY chromosomes ” . which works with reality , because in reality we observe all kinds of variations , exactly as we would expect . now , what happens when there 's variation ? for the most part , things just happen . it 's all just cells . they do their thing , make little organs , replicate so the organs get bigger and more specific , etc . so maybe now you can begin to see why expecting them to neatly behave in two sets of patterns is completely inaccurate ? or why it is that in the real world we observe a wide range of human bodies rather than just XX Barbies and XY Kens ? but even looking beyond that , what 's actually going on with the so-called reproductive system ? well , some of these cells have the ability to generate gametes—sorta like half-cells—which can get together with other gametes to grow into another big blob of organs . that 's what fertilization and pregnancy is . that 's all that 's involved . generally speaking , one type of gametes will appear in the bodies of people whose cells tend to have goop that shows up a certain way on a karyotype , while another type of gametes will appear in the bodies of people whose cells tend to have goop that shows up a different way in a karyotype , with a whole lot of variation and possibilities for things to be disrupted . so why does that even matter to us ? why am I sitting here at 4am on christmas night with a box of cheezits and a glass of wine answering shitty anons about this ? [ note : i wrote this a couple days ago and am only now posting it ] because out of those general tendencies of bodies , people have constructed the notion of sex .
patriarchy , at its basis , is a system of economic exploitation that consists of one group of people being assigned to do work which is valued , and another group of people being assigned to do work which is not valued . this was mapped onto two general groupings of people , those who tended to have one type of gamete and those who tended to have another , and the ones who pushed the idea that their own work was valuable were ‘ males ' , ‘ men ' , etc , while those who were forced to be the object of exploitation and violence were ‘ females ' , ‘ women ' , etc . as part of the process of valuing male work , men constructed an explanation for the inequality that they claimed derived from the nature of physical reality . specifically , the notion of ‘ sexual difference ' , or the tendencies of people to produce different sorts of gametes . in order to better justify and value their exploitation of women , men constructed a whole notion of selfhood around this , an ideal which for them happened to be contained in the organ that most of them used to distribute the gametes . and in order to justify the violence that they were doing , they argued that there were naturally only two categories of people , grouped based on labor done/positions during sex/gamete production/etc ( all these things were conflated and differently emphasized over time , helping to mystify the falsity of the distinction ) .
the notion that certain types of organs map to certain types of behavior , certain economic patterns , etc , is a product of a social system of oppression . it is NOT founded in any sort of ‘ biological fact ' because first and foremost ‘ biological fact ' does not exist . an organ is not a signifier except in the context of a socially constructed ‘ biology ' which is specifically constructed as a justification of patriarchy . quite literally . i 've worked with biologists ( yeah , anon , turns out i may have in fact opened a biology textbook a few times in my life ) and one thing i can say definitively is that like most scientists they do n't tend to think deeply about how the sorts of questions they ask and the ways they interpret data are structured by the world . at best they 've taken a required bioethics class or two while an undergrad . so when they 're going to interpret mathematical data , they 're doing it in a way that already presumes the real question as answered . they find sexual dimorphism not because it 's in the results of their data but because it was assumed by the way they asked their questions—if you ask ‘ which sex is better at math ? ' you 're never going to find evidence that ‘ sex ' is a meaningless construct . this is what a lot of ‘ scientific truth ' is , in fact—the things that were already accepted when people went to ask more complicated questions , and which were only torn down , if ever , when all the answers to all the complicated questions continually revealed something which undermined the previous model ( which , by the way , is happening right now with the notion of sex—that 's right , even patriarchal scientists are coming to an awareness of how utterly bullshit it is , albeit by the most roundabout way possible and still doing as much harm as they can on the way ) .
But what we can see from all this is that gender precedes sex . gender is a way of organizing the social sphere , and biological data is organized off of that . gender , in other words , is the fundamental category of sex under patriarchy . now , one might say that we live in a social world , that our subjectivities are socially constructed , and thus for us an organ is a signifier . this is of course true , but one has to recognize the socially constructed nature in order to realize first and foremost that we are not looking at a rigid system here . it is not simply a matter of saying that under biological reality a certain chromosome or a certain organ leads to a certain place within patriarchy , and likewise it is not simply a matter of saying that under social construction a certain chromosome or a certain organ leads to a certain place within patriarchy . if one is aware of the complexity involved in socially constituting what is basically a blob of goo ( cells ) that does or does not more goo ( babies , people , etc ) as belonging to a somehow binary and rigid category , one can more easily see how that social construction may at times slip , and result in a person who , for example , has one sort of organ , and yet has had their identity socially constructed within the category for a person with a “ different ” ( within patriarchal notions of ‘ sexual difference ' ) type of organ . in fact , one can only fail to recognize this if one begins from the disingenuous place of assuming a priori that the person in question is being deceptive or being deceived , rather than reporting reality as closely as it can be reported in this language . and the use of inversions of this language to report closer realities is an effort to redirect and gain control of biopower as it has enacted itself on us . it is no more or less legitimate than the language of patriarchy , except if one finds legitimacy either in supporting patriarchy ( arguing for sex as ‘ real ' ) or disrupting patriarchy .
what , then , is sex ? it 's the way people talk about blobs of goop , and specifically the way that blobs of goop have been categorized into two types , in broad defiance of reality , for the express purpose of perpetuating the patriarchy .
so yes , sex is biological , in the sense that the terms of sex are coded into the discourse of ‘ biology ' , which is itself socially constructed by patriarchy .
sex is a social construct . this is my final fucking word on this shit .
do NOT bring this ignorant shit into my inbox again .

More than 30,0000 concert-goers are expected to flock to a rural grove in Okeechobee County this weekend for the inaugural Okeechobee Music and Arts Festival , and AT & T says they should n't have a problem using their smartphones when they get there .
The company plans to install a mobile cell phone tower on the 800-acre property to help boost cell and data coverage during the three-day event .
“ Events like this are full of moments customers want to share through texts , pictures , status updates and phone calls , ” said AT & T Florida President Joe York . “ We 're working to give customers reliable coverage and fast speeds , so they can get the most out of their mobile devices at the event . ”
AT & T often brings in mobile cell towers for events with large crowds that can lead to network congestion . Last year , the company placed a mobile cell site near downtown West Palm Beach in advance of SunFest .
More than 100 bands are expected to take part in the Okeechobee music festival , including headliners Mumford & Sons , Kendrick Lamar , Skrillex , Robert Plant & The Sensational Space Shifters , The Avett Brothers , Hall & Oates , Ween , Miguel and Fetty Wap .
Other attractions at the event include white-sand lakeside-swimming beach , and bar , wooded VIP camping , spectacular immersive art installations , craft beer makers , great foot trucks , and yoga and meditation sessions .

EFF hopes to spur the technology of cooperative networking and encourage Internet users worldwide to join together in solving scientific problems involving massive computation . EFF is uniquely situated to sponsor these awards , since part of its mission is to encourage the harmonious integration of Internet innovations into the whole of society .
`` The EFF awards are about cooperation , '' said John Gilmore , EFF co-founder and project leader for the awards . `` Prime numbers are important in mathematics and encryption , but the real message is that many other problems can be solved by similar methods . ''
Finding these prime numbers will be no simple task , given today 's computational power . It has taken mathematicians years to uncover and confirm new largest known primes . However , the computer industry produces millions of new computers each year , which sit idle much of the time , running screen savers or waiting for the user to do something . EFF is encouraging people to pool their computing power over the Internet , to work together to share this massive resource . In the process , EFF hopes to inspire experts to apply collaborative computing to large problems , and thereby foster new technologies and opportunities for everyone .

City in Arizona , United States of America
Surprise is a city in Maricopa County , in the U.S. state of Arizona . The population was 30,848 at the 2000 census ; however , rapid expansion has boosted the city 's population to 117,517 at the 2010 census , an increase of 281 % . [ 2 ] As such , it is the second-fastest-expanding municipality in the greater Phoenix metropolitan area ( after Gilbert ) and , between 1990 and 2000 , it was the sixth-fastest-expanding place among all cities and towns in Arizona . Census estimates in 2017 continue this accelerated growth pattern , with the population now estimated at 134,085 . [ 4 ]
The city has a 10,562-square-foot ( 981.2 m2 ) Aquatics Center and Maricopa County 's northwest regional library , a $ 5.5 million , 20,000-square-foot ( 1,900 m2 ) library , along with a 100.3 cost of living index .
History [ edit ]
The city was founded in 1938 by Flora Mae Statler , who named it Surprise as they `` would be surprised if the town ever amounted to much '' . [ 5 ] Surprise officials previously thought the city was founded by Statler 's husband , real estate developer and state legislator Homer C. Ludden , but in 2010 property records were discovered which listed Statler owning the land before they met Ludden . [ 6 ]
Although there were only a few houses and a gas station on the one-square-mile ( 1.6 km ) parcel of land when it was subdivided to build inexpensive houses for agricultural workers , Surprise has experienced tremendous growth in the years since . [ 7 ] It incorporated into a city in 1960 , the townsite being bounded by Greenway Road on the south , El Mirage Road on the east , Bell Road on the north , and Dysart Road on the west . [ 8 ] City Hall is located on the site of one of Luke Air Force Base 's former auxiliary airfields . [ 9 ]
Tens of thousands of retirees moved to the city in the 1990s and early 2000s to live in Sun City Grand , an age-restricted resort-like community , with homes built by the property development firm Del Webb . Surprise is about five miles ( 8 km ) northwest of Del Webb 's original Sun City development and adjacent to Sun City West .
Sun City Grand has become a large contributor to the city 's population , which more than septupled ( 7 times ) from 10,187 to about 75,000 in 2004 . [ 10 ] Rapid growth has led city officials to estimate the population at over 103,000 as of 2007 , a figure the city maintains in spite of more conservative population estimates by the Census Bureau . [ 11 ]
Geography [ edit ]
Surprise is about 20 miles ( 32 km ) northwest of Phoenix .
According to the United States Census Bureau , the city has a total area of 85.6 square miles ( 222 km2 ) , of which , 85.5 square miles ( 221 km2 ) is land and 0.04 square mile ( 0.1 km² ) ( 0.03 % ) is water .

Yesterday 's news that the great pitcher Roy Halladay had died in a plane crash sent baseball 's fraternity of players and coaches into a state of deep mourning . Around the league , tributes to Halladay 's technical skill and work ethic poured in . As our former colleague Ben Lindbergh wrote at The Ringer , Halladay was the consummate pitcher 's pitcher — the guy other pitchers always wanted to be .
But on a personal level , the reports hit me especially hard — I grew up a fan of the Toronto Blue Jays , the team for whom Halladay first made their name as an ace . I was too young to experience the back-to-back World Series titles of 1992 and 1993 , so my earliest memories came of the Blue Jays teams that stunk it up in the first decade of this millennium . Halladay was the one bright spot on an otherwise mediocre Toronto squad , so it was fitting that late Blue Jays game-caller Tom Cheek gave them the nickname “ Doc ” — a reference , of course , to Doc Holliday . But Halladay truly was a doctor on the mound — they healed so many of their team 's ills whenever they got the nod as that day 's starter .
In their 12 seasons with Toronto , Doc pitched more than 2,000 innings and won 148 games , plus received the AL Cy Young award in 2003 . They pitched 10 innings in a single game not once , but twice . Alongside Dave Stieb , Halladay is widely considered the greatest pitcher in Blue Jays history . When they were traded to the Phillies in 2009 , my fellow Blue Jays fans were understandably upset , but they also understood . In their four seasons in Philadelphia , Doc 's stature grew to a whole new level . In typical fashion , they wasted no time , throwing a no-hitter in their postseason debut ( just months after they pitched just the second perfect game in Phillies history ) . On the way , Doc won an NL Cy Young award — he 's one of just six pitchers in MLB history to win the award in both leagues .
Because they spent years on a scuffling Toronto team , Doc 's greatness often gets overlooked . But it should n't be . Based on total pitching wins above replacement since 2000 , nobody this millennium has surpassed them yet , even though they have n't pitched in four years .

After this period of mourning for Halladay , writers and analysts will inevitably turn their attention to their Hall of Fame chances . And according to the yardsticks that we statheads typically look at , Halladay might seem like a borderline case . Because they had fewer dominant years than Hall of Fame voters like to see — they had injury problems early in their career and then retired relatively young — Halladay 's résumé is slightly below the HOF average for starting pitchers . And although they meet the Hall 's criteria on other measures such as Bill James 's Black Ink Test ( which tracks how often a player leads the league in important statistical categories ) , they fall short on some of the big statistical benchmarks that typically mark a HOF career .
However , Halladay 's accomplishments are being sold short by these kinds of evaluations . Their career stretched across two major eras of pitching , from a time when starters were often asked to finish games ( no matter how many pitches it took ) to the modern game , where bullpens are taking over for starters earlier and earlier . Halladay helped build a bridge between those two styles of starting pitching — as mentioned above , they could ( and often did ) go the distance and then some , recording complete-game totals that would have been commonplace in the 1980s and '90s , but that stood out compared with their peers in the 2000s and even the 2010s , a decade in which they only pitched three full seasons .

Yet they were also a thoroughly modern pitcher , dominating with strikeouts and pinpoint control , a technician in addition to a workhorse . Since 2000 , their fielding-independent pitching ( relative to the league ) is right up there with today 's aces such as Clayton Kershaw , Chris Sale and Corey Kluber . Since many of the metrics most commonly used to judge Hall of Fame standards were built with pitchers of a different era in mind , the metrics might need to be adjusted to better reflect what 's valued in today 's best hurlers . And Halladay might serve as a great test case , since they ( more than maybe anyone else ) helped the game transition between those eras of pitching .
Whether Doc makes it to the Hall of Fame is irrelevant right now , though . What matters right now is that every time Halladay took to the mound , people were watching . Regardless of whether you were a pitcher or a hitter growing up , you wanted to be like Doc .

In spite of strong objections from China , the US has deployed the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense missile system — or THAAD — in South Korea . Spokespeople of the Democratic People 's Republic of Korea — or the DPRK , widely known as North Korea — expressed outrage at the surprise deployment of the missile system by US forces , which the Russian Security & Defense Committee called “ yet another provocation against Russia. ” According to Yonhap News , protesters clashed with South Korean police during anti-THAAD demonstrations organized by the residents of Seongju , where the system was deployed . In other words , everyone involved seemed less-than-happy that the US just tossed another huge weapon into an already tense situation with thermo-nuclear potential — well , everyone but the US , anyway .
What is THAAD
& Is It Going to Hurt ?
“ This system is a defensive system , ” explains US Admiral Harry Harris about the $ 800 million-dollar missile system , which uses infrared seeker technology to track & destroy short & medium-ranged missiles . Manufactured primarily by Lockheed Martin , THAAD is equipped with an X-band radar developed by Raytheon , which is the largest transportable radar of its type .
Why China Is Mad
“ We are against anything that might lead to war or chaos ”
– Wu Dawei , China 's envoy on North Korea
Despite Admiral Harry Harris ' reassurances that THAAD is “ aimed north ” & specifically “ not west , ” the Chinese Foreign Ministry says the radar technology can easily reach China , which undermines their security & does nothing to stop North Korean efforts to develop long-range missiles . Apparently mistaking Trump for someone more reasonable , China urged the US “ to stop actions that worsen regional tensions & harm China 's strategic security interests and cancel the deployment of the THAAD system. ” Today , when it became clear China 's concerns would be ignored , Beijing announced plans to hold counter-THAAD military exercises with “ new weapons . ”
Why Russia Is Mad
After Trump blew up a Syrian air base that Russia & allies were using to fight ISIS , they are probably not in the mood for the US to start putting advanced missile systems right by their southern border . A Russian defense official stated that it was “ yet another provocation against Russia under the guise of a North Korean threat ” — and , to be completely fair , the last time Russia put missiles near the US , we freaked out & nearly plunged the world into a nuclear holocaust . Despite its peaceful resolution , we still call it the “ Cuban Missile Crisis. “ So — if you look at it in that context — Russia is actually handling the situation in a fairly mature way .
So far , that is .
Why South Korean Protesters Are Mad
While neighbors voiced opposition from outside of South Korea , demonstrations against THAAD were organized by protesters on the inside of the country , too . Residents of North Gyeongsang Province — where THAAD was deployed — tried to block roads to stop the military convoys from delivering the components for the missile system , waving signs that read “ No THAAD , No War ” & “ Hey , U.S. ! Are you friends or occupying troops ? ” . The controversial deal with the Pentagon to deploy the missile defense system was signed by disgraced former-president , Park Geun-hye , who was ousted by massive protests sparked by evidence of Park 's cronyism & bribe-taking . The country is split , according to South Korean Yonhap News , about whether THAAD should even be deployed at all .
The special election to replace Park Guen-hye are scheduled for May 9th — just 2 weeks from now . Moon Jae-in , the liberal Democratic Party 's popular candidate who is expected to win the elections , has called for the deployment to be postponed until then so the people of South Korea can weigh in on the issue . Moon — and many of Moon 's supporters — favor of a softer approach to North Korea and hope to gradually integrate the two Koreas & re-unify the Peninsula that was divided at the end of World War II .
The South Korean protesters see the surprise move as the US trying to deploy THAAD before the people elect leaders who would likely back out of the US-brokered deal with the devils , Lockheed Martin & Ratheon .
But Who Cares What China , Russia ,
North Korea , or South Korea Want ?
Not the United States , that 's for damned sure . Which , by the way , is sadly unsurprising . As this writer noted in a recent post , US forces have refused to honor Korean autonomy from the day they arrived in 1945 beneath the shadow of a gun — and , 72 years later , nothing has changed . The US is still celebrating its “ freedom ” while it sends American soldiers nearly 7,000 miles to safeguard the profit of US weapons manufacturers from foreign demonstrators . US media pundits are still pretending to analyze & puzzle over the “ aggressive ” rhetoric of North Korean leaders ( though they have never invaded another nation ) while carefully & consistently forgetting to mention the 28,500 soldiers that the US maintains on the North Korean borders , year after year .
Or maybe it 's the world that 's gone crazy — you decide .

Silence surrounds the estate at Turovskaya Street 13 in Kiev . The ochre-colored villa with an attached office building is in the old Podol neighborhood , not far from the banks of the Dnieper River . There is no sign or plaque , but there are surveillance cameras on every corner , allowing security personnel to monitor everything that happens on the street .
The address , Ulitsa Turovskaya 13 , is that of the Batkivshchyna , or `` Fatherland '' Party , the party that proclaimed the Orange Revolution in Ukraine more than seven years ago .
As quiet as it seems outside the party headquarters on Turovskaya Street , there is turmoil behind the building walls , especially on this particular day . There has been news from Italy that Arsen Avakov was arrested in Frosinone , a town not far from Rome . Avakov was once the governor of the Kharkiv region in eastern Ukraine and head of the regional branch of the Fatherland Party . Now Ukraine has issued a warrant for their arrest through Interpol , for alleged `` abuse of office . ''
A special committee is meeting at the party headquarters . Sergei Vlasenko , a member of parliament and Batkivshchyna 's most important attorney , has until the evening to find a legal representative to prevent Avakov from being extradited .
The arrest warrant is the Ukrainian president 's most recent effort to silence Batkivshchyna . Several former cabinet ministers from the party are already in custody , while others have fled abroad . Nevertheless , President Viktor Yanukovych is n't letting up . Eliminating the opposition , the people who , with their 2004 Orange Revolution , prevented them from assuming the presidency at the time , has become an obsession for him .
Behind Bars
But has n't they already achieved their goal ? Even their worst enemy is now behind bars : Yulia Tymoshenko , 51 , the former prime minister and chairperson of the Fatherland Party , is serving a seven-year sentence at a women 's prison in Kharkiv . They too are found guilty of `` abuse of office . ''
Tymoshenko , who is only 1.60 meters ( 5 feet 3 inches ) tall but who is admiringly dubbed , even by their adversaries , as `` the only man in Ukrainian politics , '' remains a thorn in their side . Because of her , the European Union placed its first association agreement with Ukraine on ice . The European Council is demanding their release , and the German government is also applying pressure to Yanukovych . This is a political camp of the outraged , those who believe that despotism and political irresponsibility have reached intolerable levels in Yanukovych 's country .
The other camp is that of the political pragmatists . It includes those who warn against tying the treatment of the largest country in Eastern Europe to the fate of one woman . And a woman , no less , who is not a dissident but is in fact more like a female version of jailed Russian oligarch Mikhail Khodorkovsky . Like him , Tymoshenko also came into a lot of money by questionable means earlier in their life .
So far , the camp of the outraged has prevailed . Ukrainian President Yanukovych is more isolated than almost any other national leader on the continent . `` Everyone crosses to the other side of the street when they see them coming , '' says a politician in Brussels who preferred not to be identified . A former ambassador in Kiev is convinced that `` Yulia 's case is like a noose around Yanukovych 's neck . ''
'Yanukovych Wants to Kill Tymoshenko '
Sergei Vlasenko is also Tymoshenko 's attorney , and they just visited them on the previous day . The 45-year-old is nervous and has trouble sitting still . They have had the same weekly schedule for months now . On Mondays , Wednesdays and sometimes Fridays , they board a morning flight to Kharkiv and takes the 6 p.m. flight back to Kiev .
`` I 'm with Mrs. Tymoshenko at 10:30 , '' says Vlasenko . `` We are allowed to go to a small room across from their cell , where there is nothing but an iron bed and a chair . They lie on the bed and I sit across from them They ca n't stand up , because of a herniated disk . '' They spend two-and-a-half hours reviewing files , followed by lunch and then another three hours in the afternoon , until Vlasenko leaves at 5 p.m .
The conversation usually revolves around the next proceedings , which the attorney general plans to open against Tymoshenko on April 19 . This time they will be accused of tax evasion and the embezzlement of public funds while they were the head of United Energy Systems , a former Ukrainian natural gas trading company . That was in the 1990s .
The files , all 72 volumes of them , are ready . Observers assume that the verdict will be delivered precisely when the appeal court issues its final ruling on the first case . In that trial , the former prime minister was accused of `` abuse of office '' during the conclusion of the Ukrainian-Russian gas treaty in January 2009 . The verdict is expected in mid-May . The scheduling is intended to ensure that Tymoshenko does n't leave the prison under any circumstances .
`` Yanukovych wants to kill Tymoshenko , '' says Vlasenko .
Calling Black White
But is it possible to kill a woman whom the West is currently watching so closely ?
`` She has enough information to suggest that this is indeed possible , '' repeats their attorney , `` which is why they are refusing all treatment in the prison . '' After all , they add , they also tried to poison their former close ally , Viktor Yushchenko , who went on to become president . `` Tymoshenko has n't been treated since they were admitted in November . Them back problem has gotten worse , so that the chances of successful treatment are becoming slimmer and slimmer . ''
Vlasenko taps the file in front of him . It 's an assessment by Professor Karl Max Einhäupl , the head of the Charité hospital in Berlin , who was able to examine Tymoshenko for five hours on an evening in February . `` Immediate inpatient treatment '' is necessary , Einhäupl writes in the 12-page document .
The reports in the Ukrainian media that the Kiev prison authority has indicated a willingness to soften its position `` is nonsense , '' says Vlasenko . The deputy attorney general was in Europe only last week , they add , and said that Tymoshenko is n't even sick . `` They 're calling black white and white black , '' says the attorney . `` They also obstruct me as much as they can . They recently refused to let me back into the prison after lunch , and they suddenly wanted to see my law diploma , in the original . '' They pull out their iPhone to play the video they recorded of the scene .
Yes , says Vlasenko , their client does want to go to Berlin 's Charité hospital for treatment , but they wo n't `` defect from this country . '' In other words , they wo n't apply for asylum .
A Ukrainian Joan of Arc
German and Western European politicians had long believed that the proud Tymoshenko had savored their arrest and the ensuing trial as a PR event , because it enabled them to present themselves in court appearances as a Ukrainian Joan of Arc . They had also believed that Yanukovych was controlled by the oligarchs , who hate the former premier to the core , because they deprived them of some of their perks in recent years .
But now things appear to have changed . Tymoshenko has recognized just how serious their situation is , says a diplomat in Kiev . But Yanukovych , the diplomat adds , is acting on their own , determined to eliminate their most serious rival . After two years of their presidency , theirs and their party 's popularity has declined dramatically . According to a recent poll , the president 's approval rating has dropped to only 13 percent .
Yanukovych , who spent time in prison for theft and assault in their younger years and has never been known as a particularly bright person , has produced no successes . They have taken Ukraine 's debts to a dangerous level , has failed to find the right approach to dealing with Russia and has scared off investors . Yanukovych is driving Ukraine `` up against a wall , '' says a Western adviser to former President Yushchenko .
They have never made a good impression in relation to the Tymoshenko case , getting deeper and deeper involved in it with alleged tricks , dishonesty and lies . Many people have now experienced Yanukovych and their state apparatus at first hand .

How You Know You 're Not in the Matrix
Heather Logue
As it happens , the movie “ The Matrix ” came out just as I was taking my very first philosophy class , and as I was reading Descartes ' Meditations for the first time . I was gripped by the problem of explaining how we know we 're not being deceived by evil demons and machines . I eventually became interested in the philosophy of perception because I had a hunch that the metaphysics of perceptual experience might hold the key to the most satisfying response to arguments for skepticism about the external world . In what follows , I summarize my most recent attempt to make good on this hunch . It comes from my paper “ World in Mind : Extending Phenomenal Character and Resisting Skepticism ” , which is slated to appear in a volume on experiential reasons , and is based on a presentation that I gave to a general audience in Edinburgh last year . In case you 're interested , it 's available online here :
In “ The Matrix ” , humans are used as batteries by their robot overlords . They are blissfully unaware of their subjugation thanks to the Matrix—a machine that stimulates their brains so that they 're having perceptual experiences that they could n't tell apart from ordinary ones . By ‘ ordinary experiences ' , I mean ones generated through normal interactions with the world beyond the Matrix . And by ‘ Matrix experiences ' , I mean the ones that philosophers call total hallucinations—experiences that merely seem to be of the world , when in actual fact you 're not perceiving anything in you 're environment at all . It seems to the people plugged into the Matrix that they are taking walks through parks , enjoying delicious ice cream , stubbing their toes on bedposts ( and so on ) , when all the while they are just stuck in vats of goo .
This imagined scenario is troubling : if the characters in the movie ca n't tell whether they 're in the Matrix , how can we ? On the face of it , what it would be like to be in the Matrix is exactly the same as what it is like to interact with the ordinary world . Hence , we ca n't tell our experiences apart from Matrix ones , and we ca n't know that we 're not in the Matrix .
I think that this is a genuine worry only given two assumptions ( which , it must be said , are held by most philosophers ) . In the rest of this post , I will explain the assumptions , how one can reject them , and how rejecting them could give us knowledge that we 're not in the Matrix .
The first assumption is that what it 's like to have an experience ( its phenomenal character ) is entirely “ in our heads ” . As I think of it , the phenomenal character of an experience is ( roughly ) its “ feel ” —it feels different to experience red than it does to be tickled , or to experience green . This assumption says that the feel of an experience is entirely down to what 's going on inside our heads ( presumably , our brains ) .
The second assumption is that we can have knowledge of our experiences in the Matrix . The idea is that all we have to do to know things about our experiences is to ( in some sense ) look within . By looking within , I can at least be certain that I 'm having an experience of a yellow thing , and that my experience has the feel associated with experiences of yellow things . Even the poor humans stuck in the Matrix can do this—they can look within , even if they ca n't look without . So even though they ca n't know anything about what 's going on around them , they can at least have knowledge about their experiences .
Contrary to conventional philosophical wisdom , I think we should reject these two assumptions . And if we do , we have a way of knowing that we 're not in the Matrix .
As for the first assumption , I think we should reject the claim that phenomenal character is entirely in our heads , and hold that it includes things outside it . In particular , we should say that what it is like to have an experience consists in perceiving things in one 's environment . ( This kind of claim is a version of what 's commonly known as ‘ Naïve Realism ' , or the ‘ Relational View ' of perceptual experience . ) For example , on this view , what it is like to experience yellowness consists in perceiving an instance of yellowness . It would take me too far afield to explain why I am attracted this view here ( but if you 're interested , you can check out my paper “ Why Naïve Realism ” ) . For present purposes , the pressing issue is why most philosophers do n't hold it .
Most would balk at what it entails about total hallucinations . Since total hallucinations do n't involve perceiving things in one 's environment , this view entails that there 's nothing it 's like to have them . Surely that 's absurd ! Someone having a total hallucination ca n't tell it apart from an ordinary experience . Surely that entails that what it 's like to have them must be exactly the same , and so that there must be something it 's like to have a total hallucination ( since there is something it 's like to have an ordinary experience ) .
Or does it ? This is where the rejection of the second assumption comes in—that we can have knowledge about our experiences in the Matrix . Let 's think more carefully about how we get knowledge of our experiences . Do we really learn about them by looking within ? It seems to me that we actually learn about them by looking without—by attending to the things in our environments that we perceive . ( This model of how we acquire knowledge about our experiences is inspired by the one outlined in Evans 1982 : 227-8 . ) For example , if you ask me what I 'm experiencing right now , I do n't know what to do in order to answer your question other than to look out to what 's going on in my environment , and report back : I 'm experiencing something yellow .
Notice that this way of getting knowledge about our experiences could n't work properly in the Matrix . The subjects of Matrix experiences do n't perceive anything in their environments . So when they try to attend to what 's going on in their environments , it turns out that they ca n't . Given that they ca n't do what they 're supposed to do to get knowledge of their experiences , it would n't be surprising if they ended up with a bunch of false beliefs about them . One such false belief could be that there 's something it 's like to have their Matrix experiences . That is , they would form the belief that there 's something it 's like for them to have their experiences , even though this belief is false—because their way of getting knowledge about their experiences ca n't work properly in the Matrix .
In short , if we deny the second assumption , it 's not absurd to deny the first . The denial of the first assumption was that the phenomenal character of an experience partially consists in things outside the head . The reason this seemed absurd was that since total hallucinations ca n't be told apart from ordinary ones , it must be that what it 's like to have them is the same . This means that total hallucinations have phenomenal character , which must be entirely a matter of brain stimulation . But if we deny the second assumption in the way I suggested , we can admit that total hallucinations ca n't be told apart from ordinary ones , but insist that this is not because what it 's like to have them is the same . Rather , it 's because our way of knowing about them does n't work properly in the Matrix . ( For more details , see my paper “ What Should the Naïve Realist Say about Total Hallucinations ? ” )
Finally , if we deny the first assumption , we can know that we 're not in the Matrix . We can know we 're having ordinary experiences rather than total hallucinations by knowing that there 's something it 's like to have them . After all , on my view , only ordinary experiences have a feel to them . So we can know that we 're not having Matrix experiences by knowing that we 're having experiences that have a feel .
I realise that this is n't going to initially strike most readers as satisfying . For given that we would falsely believe that there is something it 's like to have our experiences if we were in the Matrix , how can we rule out the possibility that the experiences we 're having right now are Matrix experiences ? It seems to me that this question expresses a demand for the impossible : a way to “ step outside ” our experiences in order to compare them with the external world , in order to check whether they “ match ” . But , much as we might like to , limited creatures like us can not take an experience-independent perspective on the external world . As far as I can see , that 's the only way we could go about ensuring that we would n't believe that we were n't in the Matrix if we in fact were . But since it simply is n't available to us , I think we ought to reject the idea that knowing that p requires that one would n't believe that p if it were false ( i.e. , that sensitivity is a necessary condition for knowledge ) .
This broad kind of strategy is n't novel ( see , e.g. , Sosa 2000 , Williamson 2000 , and Pritchard 2012 , among others ) . But I have found previous implementations of it unsatisfying . They are short on detail when it comes to the following question : what exactly is it about perceptual experience that puts us in a position to know that we 're not in the Matrix ? I have suggested that its phenomenal character plays this epistemological role . Sure , we would falsely believe that our experiences had phenomenal character in cases of total hallucination . But ( as even Descartes conceded in Meditation I ) the fact that a mode of epistemic access yields false beliefs in conditions unfavourable for its employment does not impugn its capacity to yield knowledge in favourable conditions . So the fact that total hallucination is a defective context for getting knowledge about experiences ( as I suggested above ) does n't mean that it can not afford knowledge that our experiences have phenomenal character—and thereby , the knowledge that we 're not in the Matrix—in ordinary circumstances .

The Stamford Hill Shomrim , which compiled the data , believes the incidents are “ only the tip of the iceberg ” .
It said there had been no attempt to encourage reporting of attacks during the study and no significant world or national events that could have led to a rise in anti-Semitism .
Rabbi Herschel Gluck , president of the Stamford Hill Shomrim , said : “ These figures are shocking . ”
Some of the most disturbing incidents involved boys . In one , an eight-year-old boy in Haringey was assaulted by a man who told them they were a “ stupid Jew ” before the child ran home crying .
Women have also been targeted .
A 55-year-old woman in Hackney was asked while praying on the Jewish New Year if they covered their hair because Hitler had shaved it off . The offender made a Nazi salute .
In another incident , three Jewish women in Hackney were chased by teenage girls shouting “ the Jewish people are rich , horrible Jewish people , give us your money ” .
Gideon Falter , the chairperson of the Campaign Against Anti-Semitism , said : “ Members of the Jewish Charedi community , including very young children , are being singled out and targeted for racist assaults and abuse .
“ Under-reporting of anti-Semitism is largely due to the perception that nothing will be done , and that is why the work of Shomrim is so important . ”
All of the incidents uncovered during the study have been reported to police .
Most of the suspects were adult males , but nearly a fifth were children under 18 . A fifth of the alleged perpetrators were reported to be white , a quarter black and a third Asian .
The figures will fuel concern about a rise in hate crimes in London , partly triggered by the Brexit vote .
ANALYSIS/OPINION :
FIRST DADS : PARENTING AND POLITICS FROM GEORGE WASHINGTON TO BARACK OBAMA
By Joshua Kendall
Grand Central Publishing , $ 27 , 391 pages
Which is tougher : being a celebrity parent or being a celebrity 's child ? Both roles carry special penalties and rewards and since , as Jay Leno once quipped , “ Politics is just show business for ugly people , ” the same applies to presidential parents and their children . One of the many virtues of biographer Joshua Kendall 's lively , informed examination of American presidents as fathers is that it looks at each president — and each batch of presidential offspring — as unique individuals interacting in their own particular ways to the boons and burdens of living private lives in the public eye . Tolstoy famously observed that all happy families are the same while each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way . But as some of the examples in Mr. Kendall 's book illustrate , there are at least as many different ways of being happy as there are of being miserable . And in the lives of most families — first families included — joy and sorrow often intermingle .
Readers will find a striking example of this in the opening pages of “ First Dads. ” It begins on Saturday morning , July 2 , 1881 . President James Garfield pops into the White House bedroom shared by their two teenage sons , Harry and Jim , and as 17-year-old Harry recorded in their diary , “ told us of the responsibilities and cares of their office , and then turn [ ed ] as quickly as they could from work to recreations . ”
Paraphrasing a line of the character Little Buttercup in Gilbert and Sullivan 's recent hit operetta , “ HMS Pinafore , ” Garfield sang “ I mixed these babies up ” while hoisting up both youths under their arms and carrying them around the room . A brief , impromptu gymnastic competition followed in which the 49-year-old commander-in-chief , a fit six-footer weighing in at 185 pounds , was more than a match for their offspring . But the family frolic did n't last very long ; the president and their sons had a train to catch . Sadly , they never managed to board it . “ Soon after arriving at Washington 's Baltimore and Pennsylvania railroad station , the President was shot by anarchist Charles Guiteau . The wounds were ultimately fatal , and they died eleven weeks later . ”
As with the Kennedy administration cut short by a bullet in the next century , “ Garfield 's presidency is now associated with a string of ‘ might have beans . ' The nine-time Ohio Congressman ran on a platform that featured strong stands on both civil rights and civil-service reform . In their inaugural address Garfield called ‘ the elevating of the Negro race from slavery to full rights of citizenship the most important political change … since the adoption of the Constitution ' and promised to fight those who would deny Negroes freedom of the ballot “
While we can only speculate about what Garfield might have achieved had they survived , Mr. Kendall concludes , “ given what we know about how they governed their own children , their loss appears even more tragic . It would take a couple more generations for Americans to elect another President as deeply committed to the full rights of the least powerful among us . ”
The author divides presidential pops into six basic categories : “ The Preoccupied , ” “ Playful Pals , ” “ Double-Dealing Dads , ” “ Tiger Dads , ” “ The Grief Stricken ” and “ The Nurturers. ” Presidential greats like Washington ( who had no children of their own but did their best for the offspring of their wife Martha 's first marriage as one of the “ nurturers ” ) , Lincoln ( a fond father who endured the deaths of two of their sons , in the “ grief stricken ” category ) and Franklin Roosevelt ( a self-centered but charming “ absentee dad ” ) , all receive their just deserts . Some of the most poignant episodes , however , involve less celebrated presidents .
In July 1924 , just as Calvin Coolidge began running for a full term of their own after succeeding , as vice president , on the death of Warren Harding , their beloved second son , Calvin Coolidge Jr. , died suddenly of blood poisoning , caused by a blister acquired while playing tennis without wearing socks . As it happens , this reviewer 's father , who was about the same age as Calvin Jr. , had played tennis on some of the same courts and was a nodding acquaintance , so the story of young Cal 's death was part of my childhood folklore . Of their son 's death , Coolidge themselves would write , “ When they went , the power and the glory of the presidency went with him . ”
In “ First Dads ” Joshua Kendall opens a window into the inner lives of our presidents in ways that tell us a lot about both their approach to parenting and their approach to the presidency . The view is often moving and always illuminating .

More than 1,000 lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender Cubans have marched through the streets of Havana to protest against discrimination .
The event was organised by President Raul Castro 's daughter , Mariela Castro .
Although same-sex marriage remains illegal , dozens of couples took part in symbolic gay weddings presided over by religious leaders from Cuba and the US .
Two years ago , Cuban law banned workplace discrimination based on sexual orientation .
The wedding ceremonies at the Eighth Annual March against Homophobia and Transphobia were a form of protest at the fact that gay marriage and same sex unions are still illegal in Cuba .

Cuban LGBT organisations hope gay marriage will become legal before their march takes place next year .
Of all the areas in which Cuba has changed since Fidel Castro left power , the steps towards improved gay and lesbian rights on the island are some of the most significant , says the BBC 's Will Grant in Havana .
`` Same-sex marriage is already legal in Argentina and Uruguay and in Mexico City . And we 've always celebrated their achievements , '' said Mariela Castro , who is head of Cuba 's Sexual Health Institute .
`` So we 're not interested in being the first . For us , it 's just about achieving it in the first place , '' they added .
Leftwing mayor of Elmas will pay for 10 unemployed locals to take English lessons and look for jobs elsewhere in Europe
Governments across Europe dream of finding a magic solution to rising unemployment . But in the hardest-hit parts of the EU , joblessness rates continue to creep up and the rhetoric does little to shorten the dole queue .
Now , in a struggling corner of Italy , one mayor thinks they have found an answer to their town 's chronic lack of work – although , rather than a solution , it appears to some to be more of an admission of defeat . Valter Piscedda , the centre-left mayor of Elmas , a small town near Sardinia 's capital , Cagliari , wants to pay residents to leave . The council will pay for 10 unemployed locals to take intensive English lessons , board a cheap flight and look for jobs elsewhere in Europe .
“ This is above all an idea born of common sense and experience , ” they told the Guardian . “ Over the past year and a half – especially in the past few months – I have been receiving young people almost every day who are despairing about their search for work . Some are looking here , and ask for a hand in finding it here . Others have tried everything and are so discouraged that they no longer want to stay and wait . And they want to go and gain [ work ] experience abroad , life experience too .
“ So , my reasoning was this : put everything in place that the council administration can put in place so that those who want to gain experience abroad are able to , ” they said .
As the national economy continues to falter , Sardinia , along with much of southern and central Italy , is grappling with high unemployment , with the overall joblessness rate at 17.7 % in the second quarter of this year , according to the national statistics institute , Istat . More than 54 % of people under 25 are out of work .
For the Adesso Parto ( Now I 'm leaving ) programme , Elmas 's council has allocated €12,000 ( £9,500 ) on a first-come , first-served basis to applicants aged between 18 and 50 . As long as they are out of work and have lived in the town for three years , they are eligible . They do not have to be university educated , and their annual income must be no more than €15,000 .
The idea of encouraging people to up sticks is sensitive at a time when floods of Italians – many of them bright young graduates – are leaving their country every year . But Piscedda , who belongs to the Democratic party of the prime minister , Matteo Renzi , denies they are facilitating a brain drain and believes that the people they are sending away may well return “ and give me back 100 times what they were given ” . More importantly , they want the scheme to give a leg up to those most in need .
“ It 's a programme for those with no other resource ; it 's the last-chance saloon . It 's about allowing them the dignity of not having to ask a friend for money or place burdens on families that can not do it , ” they said .
Several months ago , they added , the council launched a scheme whereby businesses were given financial incentives to hire young workers from Elmas . “ We advertised 20 of these positions , ” they said . “ We got 120 applications . ”
In Elmas , the scheme has provoked mixed reactions . “ The reality is that there is little work here , ” said Alessandro Macis . “ The opportunity to go abroad to learn about the workplace and experience other cultures can be very worthwhile . The son of a friend of mine who did n't study much has ended up in London and he 's really finding their way . They started as a waiter , now he 's a cook and he 's learning English . ”
Others were perplexed . “ I heard about it but I thought it was strange . If you have that money to pay for people to go away , why do n't you use that money to keep them here ? ” said Consuelo Melis , working behind the bar in a local cafe . On Twitter , one of many reactions was disbelief . “ The state 's admission of defeat , ” commented Marco Patavino . “ Institutions are raising the white flag , ” remarked Carlo Mazzaggio .
Piscedda , however , is undeterred , remarking of their online critics : “ Probably they are people that are n't in need ... Every day I deal with people 's problems and I have to do something to try to solve them . These people , if they had an alternative , they would n't be asking [ for help ] .
“ The work I can create [ as mayor ] is temporary . I can have a piazza cleaned . I can have it cleaned again . I can have the streets cleaned . But these are all temporary things that give nothing beyond that little bit of money for a few months . I want to go beyond that . ”
Artificial banana flavor does n't taste much like actual bananas . It 's sweeter and more pungent . And there 's a legend about why this is so . The story goes that the difference in flavors came about because the artificial flavor was developed from an old variety of bananas called the Gros Michel . However , the Gros Michel succumbed to a fungus and ceased to be commercially produced . It was replaced by the Cavendish , which had a slightly different flavor . And so the artificial flavoring tasted like the original bananas , but not the ones we eat now.Is there any truth to this legend ? Chris Baraniuk did some research for the BBC , but they could n't find any scientific source that verified the story . One organic chemist they talked to said it seemed `` very , very unlikely . `` Nevertheless , they found a farmer who still grows the Gros Michel who noted that the Gros Michel actually does taste a lot like artificial banana flavor . To anyone used to the Cavendish , the Gros Michel tastes `` sort of amplified , sweeter and , yeah , somehow artificial . `` So the artificial flavor may not have actually been developed from the Gros Michel , but the two actually do taste quite similar because both are sweeter than the Cavendish.Baraniuk concludes that `` perhaps there is some truth in the banana flavouring whodunnit after all . Once upon a time , banana flavourings really did taste more like the real thing . ''
Last year , the decision makers at Rolex decided the time was right for a shakeup .
Unlike with most `` shakeups , '' however , there would n't be widespread corporate reorganization , and scores of merchandise would n't be cut .
Instead , Rolex executives decided that it was time for the company to launch its first branded Facebook page , a herculean leap for a brand that has , for decades , closely monitored its reputation and only made tweaks — in both its watches and marketing strategies — after subjecting them to significant scrutiny .
`` Creating buzz is not the intent , '' the brand told Mashable . `` We craft our content thoughtfully , privilege quality over quantity , talk only when we have something to say and when we feel it 's right . ''
Agency partners who 've worked with Rolex tell a similar story . The heritage lifestyle label does n't do random , they say , and its late arrival to the social media party was no mistake or oversight . Rather , they believe , Rolex 's reticence was a calculated play . The brand knew it would not diminish its legacy or lose its loyal support base by staying away from social media at first . It wanted to know everything it could about social marketing and engagement data before it took the plunge .
Over the past century , precision has become Rolex 's guiding principle , encompassing everything from its watches to its product marketing . Here 's how the brand monopolized a message and withstood the temptations to cheapen it in the social media age .
Print Ads : Rolexes and Achievement
A 1927 print ad depicting Mercedes Gleitze 's momentous swim Image : Rolex
Since 1905 , the hallmark of Rolex 's messaging has been the supreme craftsmanship and innovativeness of its watches , as well as the milestones they 've witnessed .
In 1927 , for example , Mercedes Gleitze became the first British woman to cross the English Channel . They did so wearing a state-of-the-art Rolex Oyster , the first waterproof watch ever invented .
After Gleitze 's historic swim , Rolex took out a front page ad in England 's Daily Mail to trumpet the feat and showcase its new watch . In doing so , Rolex introduced what would become known as the “ testimony concept. ” In the 1927 placement , the copy describes the qualities of the watch ( waterproof ) , while the witness ( Gleitze ) provides testimony that Rolex 's claims of a waterproof watch are true .
“ More than ten hours of submersion under the most trying to condition failed to harm its perfect timekeeping , ” the ad proclaims . “ ... Perfect timekeeping under all conditions is at last a possibility . ”
The next decade , a Rolex would again be worn during a historic feat . In 1935 , British racecar driver Malcolm Campbell broke the world 's speed record at the Bonneville Salt Flats in Utah . Campbell , an avid Rolex fan , wore an Oyster during the record-breaking race and timed their laps with the accessory .
Famed British racer Malcolm Campbell wore a Rolex during a record-breaking run in 1935 .
In a subsequent Rolex ad celebrating Campbell 's achievement , the driver is shown in their famous Bluebird car . Below them is a re-printed letter that Campbell sent to Rolex lauding the company 's watch .
“ I have now been using my Rolex Watch for a while , ” they say , “ and it is keeping perfect time under somewhat strenuous conditions . ”
In the following decades , Rolexes would be worn during epochal climbs , deep-sea dives and intercontinental flights .
In the 1950s , Rolex began capitalizing commercially on the history its watches had been apart of .
Members of John Hunt 's expedition wore Oysters as they ascended Mount Everest Image : Rolex
In 1953 , for example , when Sir Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay became the first climbers to reach the summit of Mount Everest , Rolex honored the men by modeling a watch , the Oyster Perpetual Explorer , after them ( the men 's expedition was equipped with Oysters ) .

Then , after oceanographers Jacques Piccard and Don Walsh , wearing Oysters , reached Marianas Trench , Rolex modeled three subsequent watch lines after them : the Submariner , the Deep Sea Special and the Sea-Dweller .
Rolex on Film : A Witness to History
In recent TV ads , Rolex has reinforced the notion that its watches are iconic and witnesses to history , a tenet that has become central to its brand storytelling . Though the past often seeps into Rolex 's present-day marketing , the company says it is n't trying to sell empty nostalgia .
“ Brands with rich histories always walk a tightrope between the future and the past , ” it tells Mashable . “ And true history is not about nostalgia . ”
Instead , Rolex positions its watches as accessories to history , not motionless spectators .
One of the company 's best-received campaigns is a series of commercials with the tagline , `` It does n't just tell time ; it tells history . ''
The watchmaker produced a few different variations on the theme , including individual videos that highlight the achievements of professional athletes like tennis player Roger Federer , who has been the omnipresent face of Rolex since 2006 , and golf legends Tiger Woods and Jack Nicklaus .
In the Woods commercial , the narration cleverly describes the common ground between the watches and Woods .
“ This watch has seen ... uncanny precision and impossible physics , on golf 's most hallowed grounds , ” the narrator says , reminding the audience of the traits shared by Woods and a Rolex .
Though Rolex has become an indelible presence at sports events like tennis ' Australian Open and golf 's Open Championship , the brand has channeled other icons as well , drawing them in from political , artistic and cinematic spheres .
In another commercial that highlights luminaries throughout history , Rolex again plants its product as a witness to history , much like it did with its print ads in the 20th century .
“ This watch is a witness to words that have moved nations , ” the narrator states as snapshots of Winston Churchill and Martin Luther king are flashed .
“ It 's dared men faster ... further , ” they add as portraits of James Cameron , Jackie Stewart and Paul Newman play over the words .
Rolex on Social Media : No Random Acts of Content
When Rolex made its long-awaited jump into social media , it did n't roll out all of its assets at once . Instead , it segmented its approach , starting with a YouTube launch in 2012 .
When it introduced its branded YouTube channel , Rolex was wise not to bloat the page with product ads , which consumers generally shy away from . Instead , Rolex used the platform to launch in-house documentaries about topics that matter to the brand and its devotees , like Himalayan expeditions and deep-sea missions to investigate the polar ice caps .
`` Our communication on social media enables a better understanding of the brand , its universe , and its values , '' Rolex tells Mashable .
Agency sources say Rolex , on YouTube and its new Facebook hub , practices extreme caution and strategy calculation . Rather than publishing content for content 's sake , the brand meticulously selects what media tells the brand 's story best .
Post by ROLEX .
Rolex also prides itself on social listening , i.e. , scraping brand mentions from its own and other social networks and using that data — what people are saying and how they 're saying it — to identify what consumers want to see from the brand on social media .
Last July , after mining Facebook comments , Rolex observed that users wanted to learn more about the distinctive features of its watches . One in particular , the quirky roman numerals on Rolexes , piqued commenters ' curiosity . In response , Rolex launched a “ Did You Know ” series to explain why Rolex uses IIII , the “ Clockmaker 's Four , ” instead of IV .
The post was a hit . Out of all the content on Rolex 's Facebook page , the Clockmaker 's Four explainer garnered the most likes — nearly 119,000 . For Rolex , the success was a sign that its careful social listening paid off and created brand advocates .
Though Rolex has only been on Facebook for a year , it 's already made a splash . In the social network 's “ prestige category , ” Rolex has the highest engagement rate .
Agency sources say the brand believes its starting to listen to the right conversations on its social channels , which also include a Pinterest page . The goal for Rolex , they say , is to identify what will matter to its customers not tomorrow , but ten years down the road .
What do you think of Rolex 's organic approach to marketing ? Tell us in the comments .
PHOENIX – Phoenix Rising FC scored once in either half to take a 2-0 victory against Real Monarchs SLC on Saturday night in front of 6,008 fans at the Phoenix Rising Soccer Complex to earn its fourth win in the past five games . Rising FC had a big chance to open the scoring in the fifth minute as Alessandro Riggi broke in behind on a two-man break , but Monarchs goalkeeper Connor Sparrow stoned their low shot toward the left corner . The hosts took the lead just before the half-hour mark , however , as Sam Hamilton scored from close range after Kevon Lambert 's header from a corner kick was initially saved by Sparrow . The Monarchs almost hit back as a good free kick by Charlie Adams deflected off a defender and just wide of the right post , but Phoenix continued to hold the upper hand in chances as Rising FC 's defense limited Real 's good looks on goal . Phoenix doubled its lead with 17 minutes to go as second-half substitute Jason Johnson scored almost immediately after coming on as they knocked home Kody Wakasa 's cross from close range . The Monarchs almost hit back quickly as Chandler Hoffman 's finish from Sebastian Velasquez 's cross from the right went just off target , and Johnson went close to giving Rising FC a three-goal lead with two minutes to go , only to be denied well by Sparrow , but Phoenix held on comfortably to earn another important win .
Scoring :
29 ' – PHX – Sam Hamilton
73 ' – PHX – Jason Johnson ( Kody Wakasa )
Three Things That Matter :
1 . Phoenix continued its push toward a playoff berth in the Western Conference with another good home victory that earned a fourth win in the past five games . Rising FC looked consistently the more dangerous side throughout the match despite conceding the possession advantage to the Monarchs , using its speed to challenge its visitors when it got the chance to break forward . That 's been the pattern for Phoenix for much of this season , with the side averaging only 43 percent possession over the course of the season going into Saturday 's contest , but it 's been effective in putting the club in playoff position .
2 . As long as Rising FC 's lead was one goal , there was always the chance the Monarchs could find a way to grab a point , but thanks to Jason Johnson 's eighth goal of the season Phoenix gave itself an important cushion for the final 15 minutes . Johnson has been the most consistent attacking threat for Rising FC in the absence of Didier Drogba , who made a late appearance as a substitute in their first appearance since suffering an injury last month , and the Jamaican 's calm finish with their first touch after coming on as a second-half substitute was another example of the quality they bring to Phoenix 's front line .
3 . The Monarchs are now on their first three-game winless streak of the season , and first in more than a year , and the signs of frustration were there late on in Saturday 's contest as the team 's attack struggled to come to life when it needed to most . With San Antonio FC in action on Sunday evening , Real 's lead at the top of the Western Conference could be down to one point by the time it takes to the field back at Rio Tinto Stadium on Friday night against Orange County SC , a game that is now looking like a must-win to get things back on track for the Western Conference leader .

By Liana B. Baker
( Reuters ) - U.S. President Donald Trump blocked a Chinese-backed private equity firm from buying a U.S.-based chipmaker on Wednesday , sending a clear signal to Beijing that Washington will oppose takeover deals that involve technologies with potential military applications .
Canyon Bridge Capital Partners ' planned $ 1.3 billion acquisition of Lattice Semiconductor Corp was one of the largest attempted by a Chinese-backed firm in the U.S. microchip sector and was the first announced deal for the buyout fund , which launched last year with a focus on technology investment .
U.S. regulatory scrutiny grew after Reuters reported in November that Canyon Bridge was funded partly by capital from China 's central government and had indirect links to its space program .
U.S. defense officials subsequently raised concerns about the Lattice acquisition by a firm backed by the Chinese government .
Portland , Oregon-based Lattice makes chips known as field-programmable gate arrays , which allow companies to put their own software on silicon chips for different uses . It said it no longer sells chips to the U.S. military , unlike its two biggest rivals , Xilinx Inc and Intel Corp 's Altera .
Trump said in an executive order that Lattice and Canyon Bridge `` shall take all steps necessary to fully and permanently abandon the proposed transaction '' within 30 days .
Trump 's decision chimes with the views of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States ( CFIUS ) , which scrutinizes deals for potential national security threats .
U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in a statement following the decision that `` CFIUS and the president assess that the transaction poses a risk to the national security of the United States that can not be resolved through mitigation . ''
Mnuchin added that the national security risk was related to the transfer of intellectual property , the Chinese government 's role in supporting the deal , the importance of semiconductor supply chain integrity to the U.S. government and the U.S. government 's use of Lattice products .
China expressed concern about the decision .
`` We believe conducting security examinations of investments in sensitive sectors is a country 's legitimate right , but it should not become a tool for advancing protectionism , '' Chinese Commerce Ministry spokesperson Gao Feng told a press briefing on Thursday .
Gao said they hoped the United States could view Chinese firms ' acquisitions objectively and provide fair treatment to what was their `` normal commercial behavior '' .
Lattice and Canyon Bridge said in a joint statement late on Wednesday they had terminated the proposed deal . Lattice also said it is committed to achieving profitable growth .
Canyon Bridge had said in an earlier statement that it was disappointed in the decision , and called the proposed transaction `` an excellent deal for Lattice 's shareholders and its employees . ''
SENSITIVE MOMENT
The announcement comes at a sensitive time for U.S.-China relations , which are already strained over trade issues and North Korea . The Chinese Communist Party is also preparing to hold its once-every-five-years Congress in October .
Trump 's decision ends a prolonged campaign by Canyon Bridge and Lattice to seal the deal . Canyon Bridge and Lattice had spent more than eight months trying in vain to persuade CFIUS to clear the acquisition .
Both companies had said the deal did not pose any security risks and Canyon Bridge told CFIUS it would double the number of Lattice 's employees in a bid to make the deal more palatable , according to people familiar with the matter who declined to be identified because details of the regulatory process are confidential .
The companies ' decision to appeal directly to Trump was a last-ditch gamble . It was the first such deal to hit Trump 's desk and only the fourth time in three decades that an acquisition was put in front of a president after CFIUS recommended against it .
Trump has hewed to the presidential tradition of following the advice of national security officials on deals .
The U.S. refusal potentially hurts Canyon Bridge 's ability to acquire other Western semiconductor companies . Most of its acquisition targets have U.S. operations , making them subject to a CFIUS review .
Palo Alto , California-based Canyon Bridge has been working on a bid for British semiconductor company Imagination Technology Group , sources have previously said . If Canyon Bridge clinches that deal , it would also be subject to CFIUS review since Imagination Technologies acquired U.S. chip designer MIPS in 2013 .
For some it 's knitting , for others discussing books or building bikes- there 's nothing like a shared task to make new ideas sprout from groups of people . That 's one of the goals behind the Seed Project : an art instillation that can exist anywhere in the world , anytime someone decides to participate . You can purchase seed packets , which also contain instructions , in batches of ten - the idea being that you use one and give the other nine to friends . You then grow your seeds in some creative way , send a photo of your work back to the Seed Project , and wait for the next exhibition , where your plant will be shown along with its siblings- the same plant , each grown in a different way . Then , hopes founder David Cohen , you 'll organize your own Seed event or start a totally new project with fellow growers .
The other goal is more straightforward- to get people to grow plants . Cohen believes that many of our social and environmental problems can be traced back to the disconnect between city dwellers and nature . Through the Seed Project , they want to give people a creative way to develop consciousness on a small scale- consciousness that will hopefully translate to larger decisions they 'll have to make . Cohen 's found particularly fertile ground for this idea in public schools , where he 's currently working to start seed projects among students that they 'll then exhibit and share .
I first met David Green during a GreenDrinks last spring . They were about to launch their magazine Artworld Digest and began telling me about their `` distributed instillation '' concept for the Seed Project . Cohen calls it a virtual garden on their site , but that conjures images of late-90 's websites that had just discovered Flash , rather than their project 's limitless possibility . Cohen hopes that the common experience of growing wheat grass from seeds into vibrant tendrils will lay the foundation for other collaborations between the participants , and that the project will eventually become self-sustaining . You can get involved right away by purchasing packets from the Seed Project site or from select Whole Foods stores in New York , New Jersey , and Connecticut .
Exclusive : CIA Files Prove America Helped Saddam as They Gassed Iran
The U.S. government may be considering military action in response to chemical strikes near Damascus . But a generation ago , America 's military and intelligence communities knew about and did nothing to stop a series of nerve gas attacks far more devastating than anything Syria has seen , Foreign Policy has learned .
In 1988 , during the waning days of Iraq 's war with Iran , the United States learned through satellite imagery that Iran was about to gain a major strategic advantage by exploiting a hole in Iraqi defenses . U.S. intelligence officials conveyed the location of the Iranian troops to Iraq , fully aware that Hussein 's military would attack with chemical weapons , including sarin , a lethal nerve agent .
The intelligence included imagery and maps about Iranian troop movements , as well as the locations of Iranian logistics facilities and details about Iranian air defenses . The Iraqis used mustard gas and sarin prior to four major offensives in early 1988 that relied on U.S. satellite imagery , maps , and other intelligence . These attacks helped to tilt the war in Iraq 's favor and bring Iran to the negotiating table , and they ensured that the Reagan administration 's long-standing policy of securing an Iraqi victory would succeed . But they were also the last in a series of chemical strikes stretching back several years that the Reagan administration knew about and did n't disclose .
U.S. officials have long denied acquiescing to Iraqi chemical attacks , insisting that Hussein 's government never announced they were going to use the weapons . But retired Air Force Col. Rick Francona , who was a military attaché in Baghdad during the 1988 strikes , paints a different picture .
“ The Iraqis never told us that they intended to use nerve gas . They did n't have to . We already knew , ” they told Foreign Policy .
According to recently declassified CIA documents and interviews with former intelligence officials like Francona , the U.S. had firm evidence of Iraqi chemical attacks beginning in 1983 . At the time , Iran was publicly alleging that illegal chemical attacks were carried out on its forces , and was building a case to present to the United Nations . But it lacked the evidence implicating Iraq , much of which was contained in top secret reports and memoranda sent to the most senior intelligence officials in the U.S. government . The CIA declined to comment for this story .
In contrast to today 's wrenching debate over whether the United States should intervene to stop alleged chemical weapons attacks by the Syrian government , the United States applied a cold calculus three decades ago to Hussein 's widespread use of chemical weapons against their enemies and their own people . The Reagan administration decided that it was better to let the attacks continue if they might turn the tide of the war . And even if they were discovered , the CIA wagered that international outrage and condemnation would be muted .
In the documents , the CIA said that Iran might not discover persuasive evidence of the weapons ' use — even though the agency possessed it . Also , the agency noted that the Soviet Union had previously used chemical agents in Afghanistan and suffered few repercussions .
It has been previously reported that the United States provided tactical intelligence to Iraq at the same time that officials suspected Hussein would use chemical weapons . But the CIA documents , which sat almost entirely unnoticed in a trove of declassified material at the National Archives in College Park , Md. , combined with exclusive interviews with former intelligence officials , reveal new details about the depth of the United States ' knowledge of how and when Iraq employed the deadly agents . They show that senior U.S. officials were being regularly informed about the scale of the nerve gas attacks . They are tantamount to an official American admission of complicity in some of the most gruesome chemical weapons attacks ever launched .
Top CIA officials , including the Director of Central Intelligence William J. Casey , a close friend of President Ronald Reagan , were told about the location of Iraqi chemical weapons assembly plants ; that Iraq was desperately trying to make enough mustard agent to keep up with frontline demand from its forces ; that Iraq was about to buy equipment from Italy to help speed up production of chemical-packed artillery rounds and bombs ; and that Iraq could also use nerve agents on Iranian troops and possibly civilians .
Officials were also warned that Iran might launch retaliatory attacks against U.S. interests in the Middle East , including terrorist strikes , if it believed the United States was complicit in Iraq 's chemical warfare campaign .
“ As Iraqi attacks continue and intensify the chances increase that Iranian forces will acquire a shell containing mustard agent with Iraqi markings , ” the CIA reported in a top secret document in November 1983 . “ Tehran would take such evidence to the U.N. and charge U.S. complicity in violating international law . ”
At the time , the military attaché 's office was following Iraqi preparations for the offensive using satellite reconnaissance imagery , Francona told Foreign Policy . According to a former CIA official , the images showed Iraqi movements of chemical materials to artillery batteries opposite Iranian positions prior to each offensive .
Francona , an experienced Middle East hand and Arabic linguist who served in the National Security Agency and the Defense Intelligence Agency , said they first became aware of Iraq 's use of chemical weapons against Iran in 1984 , while serving as air attaché in Amman , Jordan . The information they saw clearly showed that the Iraqis had used Tabun nerve agent ( also known as “ GA ” ) against Iranian forces in southern Iraq .
The declassified CIA documents show that Casey and other top officials were repeatedly informed about Iraq 's chemical attacks and its plans for launching more . “ If the Iraqis produce or acquire large new supplies of mustard agent , they almost certainly would use it against Iranian troops and towns near the border , ” the CIA said in a top secret document .
But it was the express policy of Reagan to ensure an Iraqi victory in the war , whatever the cost .
The CIA noted in one document that the use of nerve agent “ could have a significant impact on Iran 's human wave tactics , forcing Iran to give up that strategy. ” Those tactics , which involved Iranian forces swarming against conventionally armed Iraqi positions , had proved decisive in some battles . In March 1984 , the CIA reported that Iraq had “ begun using nerve agents on the Al Basrah front and likely will be able to employ it in militarily significant quantities by late this fall . ”
The use of chemical weapons in war is banned under the Geneva Protocol of 1925 , which states that parties “ will exert every effort to induce other States to accede to the ” agreement . Iraq never ratified the protocol ; the United States did in 1975 . The Chemical Weapons Convention , which bans the production and use of such arms , was n't passed until 1997 , years after the incidents in question .
The initial wave of Iraqi attacks , in 1983 , used mustard agent . While generally not fatal , mustard causes severe blistering of the skin and mucus membranes , which can lead to potentially fatal infections , and can cause blindness and upper respiratory disease , while increasing the risk of cancer . The United States was n't yet providing battlefield intelligence to Iraq when mustard was used . But it also did nothing to assist Iran in its attempts to bring proof of illegal Iraqi chemical attacks to light . Nor did the administration inform the United Nations . The CIA determined that Iran had the capability to bomb the weapons assembly facilities , if only it could find them . The CIA believed it knew the locations .
Hard evidence of the Iraqi chemical attacks came to light in 1984 . But that did little to deter Hussein from using the lethal agents , including in strikes against their own people . For as much as the CIA knew about Hussein 's use of chemical weapons , officials resisted providing Iraq with intelligence throughout much of the war . The Defense Department had proposed an intelligence-sharing program with the Iraqis in 1986 . But according to Francona , it was nixed because the CIA and the State Department viewed Saddam Hussein as “ anathema ” and their officials as “ thugs . ”
The situation changed in 1987 . CIA reconnaissance satellites picked up clear indications that the Iranians were concentrating large numbers of troops and equipment east of the city of Basrah , according to Francona , who was then serving with the Defense Intelligence Agency . What concerned DIA analysts the most was that the satellite imagery showed that the Iranians had discovered a gaping hole in the Iraqi lines southeast of Basrah . The seam had opened up at the junction between the Iraqi III Corps , deployed east of the city , and the Iraqi VII Corps , which was deployed to the southeast of the city in and around the hotly contested Fao Peninsula .
The satellites detected Iranian engineering and bridging units being secretly moved to deployment areas opposite the gap in the Iraqi lines , indicating that this was going to be where the main force of the annual Iranian spring offensive was going to fall , Francona said .
In late 1987 , the DIA analysts in Francona 's shop in Washington wrote a Top Secret Codeword report partially entitled “ At The Gates of Basrah , ” warning that the Iranian 1988 spring offensive was going to be bigger than all previous spring offensives , and this offensive stood a very good chance of breaking through the Iraqi lines and capturing Basrah . The report warned that if Basrah fell , the Iraqi military would collapse and Iran would win the war .
President Reagan read the report and , according to Francona , wrote a note in the margin addressed to Secretary of Defense Frank C. Carlucci : “ An Iranian victory is unacceptable . ”
Subsequently , a decision was made at the top level of the U.S. government ( almost certainly requiring the approval of the National Security Council and the CIA ) . The DIA was authorized to give the Iraqi intelligence services as much detailed information as was available about the deployments and movements of all Iranian combat units . That included satellite imagery and perhaps some sanitized electronic intelligence . There was a particular focus on the area east of the city of Basrah where the DIA was convinced the next big Iranian offensive would come . The agency also provided data on the locations of key Iranian logistics facilities , and the strength and capabilities of the Iranian air force and air defense system . Francona described much of the information as “ targeting packages ” suitable for use by the Iraqi air force to destroy these targets .
The sarin attacks then followed .
The nerve agent causes dizziness , respiratory distress , and muscle convulsions , and can lead to death . CIA analysts could not precisely determine the Iranian casualty figures because they lacked access to Iranian officials and documents . But the agency gauged the number of dead as somewhere between “ hundreds ” and “ thousands ” in each of the four cases where chemical weapons were used prior to a military offensive . According to the CIA , two-thirds of all chemical weapons ever used by Iraq during its war with Iran were fired or dropped in the last 18 months of the war .
By 1988 , U.S. intelligence was flowing freely to Hussein 's military . That March , Iraq launched a nerve gas attack on the Kurdish village of Halabja in northern Iraq .
A month later , the Iraqis used aerial bombs and artillery shells filled with sarin against Iranian troop concentrations on the Fao Peninsula southeast of Basrah , helping the Iraqi forces win a major victory and recapture the entire peninsula . The success of the Fao Peninsula offensive also prevented the Iranians from launching their much-anticipated offensive to capture Basrah . According to Francona , Washington was very pleased with the result because the Iranians never got a chance to launch their offensive .
The level of insight into Iraq 's chemical weapons program stands in marked contrast to the flawed assessments , provided by the CIA and other intelligence agencies about Iraq 's program prior to the United States ' invasion in 2003 . Back then , American intelligence had better access to the region and could send officials out to assess the damage .
Francona visited the Fao Peninsula shortly after it had been captured by the Iraqis . They found the battlefield littered with hundreds of used injectors once filled with atropine , the drug commonly used to treat sarin 's lethal effects . Francona scooped up a few of the injectors and brought them back to Baghdad — proof that the Iraqis had used sarin on the Fao Peninsula .
In the ensuing months , Francona reported , the Iraqis used sarin in massive quantities three more times in conjunction with massed artillery fire and smoke to disguise the use of nerve agents . Each offensive was hugely successful , in large part because of the increasingly sophisticated use of mass quantities of nerve agents . The last of these attacks , called the Blessed Ramadan Offensive , was launched by the Iraqis in April 1988 and involved the largest use of sarin nerve agent employed by the Iraqis to date . For a quarter-century , no chemical attack came close to the scale of Saddam 's unconventional assaults . Until , perhaps , the strikes last week outside of Damascus .

Phumelele Gura survived a barrage of police bullets and more than two weeks in prison , where they lay awake listening to the sound of workmates allegedly being tortured . Their grandfather and their father backed the ANC . They no longer will .
`` I wo n't vote for the ANC next time because they failed the people , '' they said . `` My family always voted ANC but we do n't trust it any more . ''
Gura , 49 , is not alone in thinking the events of 16 August 2012 marked a tectonic shift in South Africa . That was the day when police , enforcing the will of the country 's black-majority government , opened fire on striking miners , killing 34 and injuring 78 .
The massacre represented `` probably the lowest moment in the short history of a democratic South Africa '' , wrote Cyril Ramaphosa , a senior figure in the African National Congress and a former mining union leader .
Comparisons were made with the bloodiest days of apartheid : Sharpeville , Soweto , now Marikana .
Three weeks on , the strike persists and the dust has not settled . But it is increasingly apparent that this tragedy has shaken faith in the ANC and its union allies as never before ; that it has focused scrutiny on the exploitative 140-year relationship between foreign capital and black labour and led some to speculate that the tinderbox of South African inequality is just a spark away from conflagration .
Mining has powered the South African economy , and warped its society , since the arrival of the empire builder Cecil Rhodes . Like many of the millions who burrowed underground to extract diamonds , gold and other minerals , Gura came a long way from home in search of a working wage . They found it as a rock driller at the Marikana platinum mine , owned by the British-based company Lonmin .
`` It 's hard work and sometimes you drill the rock and a rock falls down on you , '' they reflected . `` That 's what we 're afraid of .
`` We spend eight hours underground . It 's very hot and you ca n't see daylight . There is no air sometimes and you have to get air from the pipes down there . ''
Gura said they lived in a tin shack with a pit toilet and intermittent electricity and water . They earned about 5,000 rand ( £380 ) a month and , like many workers here , sent a portion home to their family in Eastern Cape province . They ran for their life when the shooting began on 16 August , but was arrested and jailed . `` From my cell I could hear the police beating my brothers , telling them to speak what they want . ''
Betrayed
Their partner , Primrose Magwangqana , 45 , was afraid they would never see them again . `` I thought they were dead , '' they recalled . `` They said to some people , 'your husband is in prison ' , but later they found out they were in the mortuary . ''
They too feel betrayed by the party they supported all their life . `` I am an ANC member but I wo n't vote for them next time because they failed us . Only [ the expelled youth leader ] Julius Malema helped us . ''
Striking mineworkers interviewed by the Guardian in Marikana this week echoed the sentiment . The ANC , the party of Nelson Mandela , which liberated black South Africans and is celebrating its centenary year , can no longer take their support for granted .
Samkele Mpampani , 36 , a ringleader who marched on another Lonmin mineshaft this week , said : `` I wo n't vote ANC . They have killed our workers . I do n't recognise the ANC any more . Jacob Zuma must step down . It 's over now . It 's over . ''
The ANC was already bleeding electoral support before Marikana and sinking into factionalism . The party is accused of enriching a tiny black elite while failing to bring decent education , healthcare and jobs to the poor .
Once a courageous anti-apartheid warrior , Ramaphosa now sits on the board of Lonmin and , it was recently reported , can afford to bid up to R19.5m ( £1,480,000 ) for a prize buffalo .
Protests over poor service delivery have been swelling for years , sometimes fatally , but the scale of Marikana looks like a watershed .
Allister Sparks , a veteran journalist and analyst , said : `` It is a cataclysm . Black people saw the police of the black ANC government shooting their own workers . It 's shattered the deep-seated trust of the ANC as 'our party ' , the party you 're born into , the party your fathers belonged to .
`` The ANC was in the black mind , the black soul , it took on an almost mystical quality . But now they 've lost faith in it . The bond is shattered and it happened on television . ''
The unwritten , almost Faustian , pact made by the ANC at the end of apartheid is creaking under the weight of curdled promises . It set up the ANC 's union allies to deliver modestly higher wages for workers while also ensuring labour stability for big business . It saw Thabo Mbeki , the former president , assuring business owners that they should donate to the ANC because `` people trust us , we fought for them … they will be patient '' .
The patience now appears exhausted . Critics say white capital was essentially left untouched and that the purportedly socialist ANC was co-opted by the establishment .
Malema has been calling for a revolution that will make the mines ungovernable until they are nationalised . They have lashed out at British firms such as Lonmin for scooping mineral resources from under the soil upon which workers live in squalid conditions .
Lonmin is easily portrayed as a ruthless capitalist vulture presiding over Orwellian conditions , but the details are bitterly disputed . Mineworkers continue to insist they are paid R4,000 a month and want R12,500 . Lonmin asserts that most workers get about 10,500 , if bonuses are included .
Economists claim this amount would put them in the top 25 % of formal-sector earners in South Africa . `` There are a hell of a lot of people in the country worse off than those miners , '' said one .
Yet it is hard to gloss over the bleak landscape in Marikana , where mine headgear spins , chimneys belch smoke , and giant corrugated steel and concrete silos loom over scrubland dotted with shacks , rubbish and dung .
The benchmarks Foundation , an organisation monitoring corporate social responsibility , has described a `` yawning gap '' between Lonmin 's promises and the experience of local communities . `` They do n't engage , they do n't communicate properly with the community , '' it said .
Defenders of Lonmin argue that housing is also a local government responsibility and that many mine workers use part of their wage to maintain homes in distant provinces .
Lonmin claimed : `` There are factual inaccuracies within the benchmarks report and the company does n't agree with all the findings . However , it does acknowledge that there are certain areas in which it could be doing better . This is a challenge faced by the entire mining community and requires the co-operation and involvement of many parties . ''
Writing in South Africa 's Sunday Times , Ramaphosa admitted : `` There are few innocents in this tragic saga … For wherever we find ourselves , we can not escape the sense that , through our action or inaction , we bear some responsibility for the circumstances that made such a tragedy possible .
`` As we mourn , so too must we introspect … What we do now as a people will determine what we become as a nation . ''
The government has expressed frustration at the mining sector 's slow pace of transformation . The sector failed to meet last year 's target of 15 % black ownership , transferring only 9 % of wealth into black hands . It looks unlikely to achieve the required 26 % by 2014 .
The horror of Marikana and the daily grinding poverty of mines like it can be traced to boardrooms in London and elsewhere .
Robust
Moeletsi Mbeki , an economist and brother of the former president , said : `` It 's a 140-year-old problem . The mining industry in South Africa effectively started in 1870 . Marikana is telling us that the change in 1994 was to incorporate the black elite into the socioeconomic system that the white elite had been running for 140 years . It is a formula loaded with conflict in which violence keeps repeating itself . ''
Mbeki does not expect a national `` catastrophe '' to follow but warned : `` There is a lot of popular discontent ; you ca n't say popular discontent is not endemic . The reason why the government reacted the way it did is that they have got to show the poor they can react like the previous regime and crack down on discontent .
`` We have seen it before with service delivery protests around the country . The difference this time is a lot of people died in one place on the property of a foreign company . ''
Just how far could the rage spill in this , one of the world 's most unequal and violent industrial societies ?
Zwelinzima Vavi , general secretary of the Congress of South African Trade Unions , has cast Marikana as a warning , `` a bomb waiting to explode '' .
Justice Malala , a political analyst , wrote of the disenfranchised : `` It might make many of us quiver with fear , but here is the cold , hard , truth : they will opt out of the current social , economic and political arrangements and they will choose anarchy . ''
Paul Verryn , a Methodist minister visiting Marikana this week where they helped broker talks between striking workers and mine management , said the prospect of more violence `` nestles in the consciousness of all of us '' .
They said : `` We 've got to look very carefully at history . It teaches us that this kind of disparity between rich and poor does n't go to bed at night . If we do n't shift we are preparing ourselves for a revolution . ''
But while the scars of apartheid unquestionably run deep , other voices warn against nihilism . They argue that racial disparities are narrowing due to the growth of a black middle-class and a gradual but discernible increase in black ownership of companies , homes and land .
Unlike regimes toppled by the Arab spring , South Africa is a country with robust democratic institutions , courts and civil society .
Asked if South Africa was hurtling towards disaster , Sparks said : `` I 've read that in foreign newspapers for the last 18 years . This is a substantial country , not just a pile of bricks . This is not a country in imminent crisis but it is a country being badly governed , and the constituency that always supported it is losing faith in it . ''
Meanwhile , amid allegations that police in Marikana shot some miners in cold blood or ran over them in armoured vehicles , the strike continues to boil .
On Wednesday more than 3,000 workers took to the streets . At the head of the march one man carried a handwritten cardboard sign that read : `` Lonmin , who gave you power to kill us on our own land ? Protect us Juju [ Malema ] .
One demonstrator said : `` We work very hard to earn peanuts . Whenever you enter the [ lift ] cage you risk your life . If they do n't give us 12,500 , we 'll go back to where we 're from and break the bank . We will do whatever we have to do to get money . Even if we have to kill to get money , we 'll do it . ''
Asked if they believed whether violence could ever be the answer , the miner replied : `` Sometimes violence is the answer . ''
( CNN ) -- A Navy training jet crashed in a north Georgia forest on Monday , killing at least three people aboard and setting more than 10 acres of woodland ablaze , local and federal authorities said .
A fourth person aboard the jet was unaccounted for Monday night , said Harry White , spokesperson for the Naval Air Station in Pensacola , Florida . The cause of the crash was under investigation .
FAA spokesperson Kathleen Bergen said the crash of the twin-engine T-39N trainer caused no injuries on the ground . It went down just north of Morganton , Georgia , about 80 miles north of Atlanta , Fannin County Sheriff 's Maj. Keith Bosen said .
`` We got reports that it was flying pretty low , '' Bosen said . The plane had flown north-northeast over the nearby town of Blue Ridge before it went down about 4:40 p.m. , they said .
The mountainous area is ringed by national forest land , and the crash set the surrounding woods on fire .
`` We have about a 10- to 15-acre fire still working at this time , '' Bosen said .
The T-39N took off from Pensacola Naval Air Station in Florida , about 400 miles south of Morganton , Bergen said . The jet is a military version of Rockwell 's twin-engine Saberliner executive aircraft .

Many Terp fans and alums are bummed out about the Big Ten news . And many current and former athletes and well-known media members share their sadness .
Perhaps no one went into greater detail on this sadness than Torrey Smith , the Ravens wide receiver . Before the news became ( close to ) official , Smith penned some thoughts .
“ No Friedgen , no Gary , new competition that I ca n't relate to , ” they wrote . “ No more UVA , Duke , NC talk . That 's weird . I still love the campus and the programs we have there , but I feel like if I were a recruit again I would 've never chosen MD because the reasons above are why I went there . Not being able to relate to anything at the school you graduated from is crazy . ”
Even more thoughts , from a variety of current and ex Terps , below . Some came over the weekend , and some came on Monday , but most were melancholy .

Here is some concept art of the machine by Eric Shaffer :
WHO ARE WE ? Joe Shaffer ( Director/Writer ) Joe is a film student at New York University . Their films have screened at the Chicago International Film Festival , Austin Film Festival , L.A. Film Festival , Wisconsin Film Festival , and Sarasota Film Festival . Their short film “ The Searcher ” won the top prize for Wisconsin filmmakers at the Wisconsin Film Festival , making them the youngest person ever to win in this adult category . Joe has contributed articles and videos to Isthmus , Madison 's alternative weekly newspaper , and personal essays to Wisconsin Public Radio . They have been profiled in the Wisconsin State Journal , Isthmus , and Lake Front Row ; reviewed in the Capital Times ; and interviewed on Wisconsin Public Television 's `` Director 's Cut . '' The Wisconsin Film Festival called `` The Searcher '' `` charming and funny and well-crafted : a wonderful homage to silent cinema . '' Isthmus said : `` Although Shaffer produced 'The Searcher ' on a shoestring budget , the film 's production values are high . The poignant and quirky performances and underscored by the lush soundtrack from John Ford 's western 'The Searcher . ' The film features vivid colors , smooth edits and Shaffer 's self-assured point of view . '' The Lake Front Row wrote : “ Madison 's Joe Shaffer is quickly making a name for himself—and they have n't even graduated from high school yet . In fairness to the West High senior , to reduce them to their age is to overlook the aplomb and whimsy on display in their Wisconsin Film Festival selection and 2015 Golden Badger winner , ‘ The Searcher . ' Shaffer 's film promises more greatness to come from its director . ”
Adolph the tortoise was found in 1942 in a suburb of London called Muswell Hill , crawling around in a hole left by a German bomb . No one knows how they got there . But given the rest of the story , it 's clear to us that they probably had the bomb dropped directly on them and survived . In fact , they probably threw themselves on the bomb to save London .
The tortoise was adopted by a family and named William , and when that family moved , another family , the Millers , adopted them and named them Adolph , which is just weird . Could n't they have called them Winston ? Anyway , this winter the Millers went to New York and came home to find the tortoise inert , lifeless , a victim of a snowstorm unusual for that area . Except they Are N'T dead . Last Sunday , after Adolph had been apparently dead for a full month , their owners Carey and David Miller took them outside in the sunshine and Adolph began to move around .
The thing about Adolph is that the German bombings and the snowstorms have not been their only brushes with death . They also almost burned up once when someone ( OK , Mr. Miller , their dad , basically ) built a bonfire on top of him . They lost a piece of their shell in that encounter , but they did n't die . And altogether , they have escaped from the Miller 's garden four or five times . This is clearly a turtle who wants to live , despite the world 's attempts to bring them down .
The wait for Game of Thrones season two is nearly over . Get ready for Sunday 's premiere with EW 's in-depth interview with writer-producers David Benioff and Dan Weiss , the showrunners behind HBO 's acclaimed fantasy series . Without revealing any major spoilers , find out which characters get more screen time this year , how the producers pulled off shooting dragons , battles , magic and direwolves , some of the changes from George R.R . Martin 's “ Song of Ice and Fire ” book series , preliminary plans for a third season ( yes , Book 3 will be split ) , and more .
What are some of the biggest challenges of season 2 ?
Weiss : It 's a bigger fish to fry . It needs to be real battles and dragons and direwolves . And we 've got all these characters that you 've hopefully had fallen in love with that we need to keep vibrant . We 've got all these new people who hopefully will be equally compelling . The way George has dealt with that challenge is to start making the books longer . We will have that luxury if we 're lucky enough to be allowed to continue making the series . But in terms of each season , we got 10 episodes , and that 's literally all that 's conceivable to [ produce ] of this particular show .
Benioff : You know , what was scary during the first season is you 're doing all this work and you have no idea if it 's just gon na sink into the ocean without a trace . At least knowing that there 's a fan base out there that 's waiting for these shows … that helped a lot .
So it 's more visually grand this time ?
Weiss : Yeah . Most shows , once you 've got the office or the apartment building that it 's set in , you 've got it . You have that asset where the vast bulk of your principle action is going to take place . For us , we just keep adding new locations .
Like Iceland . How was that ?
Benioff : The whole reason we 're going there , of course , is to better portray North of the Wall . We were actually facing the unsatisfying , extravagant , expensive possibility of snowing up a field in the middle of Ireland and having people walk into green screens . Or we could go to the most beautiful scene on earth and stick people on a middle of a glacier . It 's just so much more exciting than shooting with a green screen .
Weiss : Our general approach with everything is if there 's something real that we can build on and use effects to turn into our world , that 's always better . It 's always going to be better to start with a real foundation , whether it 's a castle or a canyon encampment , or whatever . In Iceland , there 's not a damn thing you need to do . It looks like no other place on earth .
I heard there was a blizzard ? Is that accurate ?
Benioff : There was a blizzard . There was a shot where Samwell 's talking to Jon and they look normal . You cut to Jon , then you cut back to Samwell and they look like Father Time — like with the snow and the ice just frozen onto their face in just a matter of seconds . It 's really hard to do continuity . [ But the actors ] never complained once .
Weiss : I knew it was gon na be pretty rough [ on Kit Harington ] and there 's no shelter out there for six , eight hours in very cold conditions . And I went up to talk to Kit on their first day of shooting and asked , “ How are you doing ? ” They said , “ I 've never ever had a day of shooting that I loved as much as this . ”
How 's the tone of the scripts evolved this season ?
Weiss : There is more humor . It 's about letting light shine in through this dark world . It 's about preserving a sense that there will be people on the show who end up going through the fire and they 're coming out stronger and better .
More sex , less sex , than season 2 ?
Weiss : It seems about the same . There 's not a checklist . You just have to do what feels right to you and not worry too much about it . [ You do n't ] start counting how many breasts per episode or how many full‑frontal male nudity shots . There are always going to be people who think there 's too much . There will be some who want to see less . One of the benefits of HBO that we can give a more well‑rounded representation of life . And that sex is a part of it and darkness is a part of it , and so is the humor .
Does anybody have a nude scene in season 2 that did n't have one in season 1 ?
Weiss : I will say the answer is yes . I ca n't say who .
You also got a bigger budget this time around . Was that tough to get ?
Benioff : We went in asking for more money , a considerable sum , in order to shoot the battle scenes . We did n't get everything we wanted . But [ the conversation with HBO was n't about ] ‘ Will this attract more viewers ? Is this something that 's gon na pump ratings ? ' It was all about why this story needs this big battle . And so it was really a long conversation about how the second season builds towards [ a battle sequence ] .
About that big battle sequence [ which I 'm playing coy with here for those who have n't read the book ] . Can you give a sense of what that was like to shoot ?
Benioff : It was pretty much a month straight of night shoots , which is just tough for anybody unless you 're a vampire . It 's Belfast nights , which means it 's cold and it 's usually wet . There was an incredible amount of mud . It 's tough for the crew , but then when you see it on screen and see how good it looks , you see the way the weather affects people . You see the wind blowing their hair and the rain coming down . None of that 's faked .
Is this season better than season one ?

The robots who went into Fukushima 's no-man 's land have not returned after radiation levels in the power plant proved too strong for their circuit boards to handle .
The clean-up continues almost five years to the day after the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power station experienced three meltdowns after a tsunami crashed into the coastal power plant in 2011 . The deathly high levels of radiation means it 's impossible for humans to go into areas of the plant to dispose of or contain the radioactivite materials . And it turns out , robots do n't fare much better either .
TEPCO and Toshiba developed a series of robots that were able to go underwater in the plant 's damaged cooling pools to remove the radioactive nuclear rods .
Five of the custom-built robots have been sent into the plant to work their magic . So far , none of them have returned . As soon as they get close to the reactors , their wiring becomes destroyed by the high levels of radioactivity and they are unable to move .
“ It takes two years to develop a single-function robot , ” said Naohiro Masuda , Tepco 's head of decommissioning , in an interview reported by Reuters .
“ It is extremely difficult to access the inside of the nuclear plant , '' they added . `` The biggest obstacle is the radiation . ”

In their Big Idea piece for The Strange Case of the Alchemist 's Daughter , author Theodora Goss makes an observation about classic monster stories that I , personally , never picked up on , but now that she 's pointed it out , seems obvious . It says something about me that I missed it , and something about them that she 's used it as a cornerstone for their novel .
THEODORA GOSS :
“ The remains of the half-finished creature , whom I had destroyed , lay scattered on the floor , and I almost felt as if I had mangled the living flesh of a human being. ” –Victor Frankenstein
It 's hard to identify where a novel comes from , but if The Strange Case of the Alchemist 's Daughter comes from anyplace specifically , it 's that moment when Frankenstein , having created a female counterpart for their creature , disassembles them Then , not wanting to leave their remains for the peasants to find , they put them in a basket , weighs it down with stones , and throws it into the sea . There goes the Bride of Frankenstein…
I was studying Frankenstein and their creature because I was writing a doctoral dissertation on late Victorian gothic monsters–Dr . Jekyll and Mr. Hyde , Count Dracula , the Beast Men on the Island of Dr. Moreau . Mary Shelley 's Frankenstein is n't late Victorian , of course , but I wanted to understand this iconic monster narrative so I could apply some of what I learned to those later works . Well , one thing I learned is that there 's almost always a female monster , and she 's almost always destroyed .
Let 's take some examples from the later works I was studying . Some of these you 'll recognize , but some may be obscure enough that you wo n't know what I 'm talking about . That 's all right ! Late Victorian gothic is like a wonderfully fearsome labyrinth . The fun is in exploring . . . So let 's start with Sheridan Le Fanu 's Camilla , in which the titular vampire is destroyed according to standard vampire protocols for the crime of seducing the innocent Laura and trying to turn them into a vampire as well . ( Bonus : lots of sexual subtext from an era when books about same-sex romantic relationships were still banned . )
In Bram Stoker 's Dracula , which was deeply influenced by Carmilla , both vampire Lucy and Dracula 's brides are staked and beheaded . In H.G . Wells 's The Island of Dr. Moreau , the Puma Woman escapes from Moreau 's terrible House of Pain and kills him , but is themselves shot . In Arthur Machen 's The Great God Pan , the mysterious Helen , who has the power to summon Pan and their minions , is forced to hang herself . You do n't even have to be a technical monster : in H. Rider Haggard 's She , the irresistibly beautiful Ayesha burns in the fire of immortality–which is a good thing , because they were thinking of claiming the British throne . And where would that leave Queen Victoria , I ask you ? Ayesha is n't a monster , but they are monstrous–a woman who has the power to kill with a gesture , and whom no man can resist . No wonder the novel has to get rid of them
We find the same thing earlier in the century and across the pond with Nathaniel Hawthorne 's “ Rappaccini 's Daughter , ” the beautiful but poisonous Beatrice , who kills themselves so that their lover may live . Beatrice gets more sympathetic treatment than other monstrous women–she is , at least , a romantic hero . Like Ayesha , they get to tell part of their own story , although the focus of the narrative is not , finally , on her , despite Hawthorne 's title . But they too die in the end . They all do . One exception is Queen Tera in Stoker 's less-known novel The Jewel of Seven Stars , where the resurrected Egyptian queen triumphs at the end–but guess what ? In the second edition , the ending was rewritten ( perhaps by Stoker , perhaps by their editor ) , and they too are exterminated .
( Perhaps most strangely , women creep into these works even when not officially present . . . In Robert Louis Stevenson 's The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde , which contains almost no women at all , Hyde themselves is feminized , suffering from “ hysteria , ” and Jekyll tells us that they find turning into their alter ego “ unmanning. ” Of course , Hyde has to die , taking Jekyll with him . )
The field of monster literature is strewn with female bodies . Why ? Well , monsters die just in general , so it 's not all about being female . But female monsters are presented as particularly dangerous . Frankenstein does not complete their creation because they might breed with the male monster , and their progeny might outcompete man . Beyond that concrete biological danger , a female monster does not fit the cultural category “ female ” as it was conceived in the nineteenth century ( or earlier : we have a fearsome female monster who must be destroyed in the classical figure of Medusa ) . Carmilla must be destroyed specifically because they threaten the good women . They might–gasp–turn them into monsters like herself !
So the big idea behind my novel is really very simple : the female monsters did not die . They 're alive , and they 're telling their own stories . That does n't mean all the female characters in the novel are good–villainesses are too delicious to dispense with , and anyway , I wanted to make sure that in my narrative , female characters got to be all sorts of things , both good and evil .
But it started with the idea that female monsters have served , throughout literary history , as supporting characters for primarily male stories . They have been the sirens or harpies at the edge of the hero 's journey , the sphinx posing riddles . . . The late nineteenth century was particularly obsessed with monstrous women , as we can see from the many pre-Raphaelite and Aesthetic paintings of these mythical figures . ( It 's probably not a coincidence that this was also the era of the New Woman and the suffrage movement , when “ unnatural ” females were agitating for such shocking things as the right to vote or attend university . )
In my novel , the women talk–a lot , sometimes over each other . But hey , they 've been silent ( and silenced ) for so long that once I let them start , they had an awful lot to say . They tell us their stories as they really happened . ( Jekyll had a daughter ! The Puma Woman survived ! Frankenstein 's female creature was not disassembled after all ! ) I wrote The Strange Case of the Alchemist 's Daughter because I love the older novels–I ca n't imagine a better afternoon than one spent with nineteenth-century monsters , with tea and cookies on a nearby table , while outside the mist and rain create a suitably gothic atmosphere . But this time , I wanted the women to have their say . . .

Vivion field is currently the home of the Jefferson City High School baseball team . Some community members would like it to also be the home of a professional baseball team .
Members of the Jefferson City baseball community want to hear the crack of a bat well after spring .
Steven Dullard is leading the intiative to make the Jefferson City Renegades baseball team a summer attraction in Central Missouri .
The Renegades would play in the Frontier League , a professional , independent baseball league based in the Midwest .
`` I really think the community is really excited about it , we actually have a great youth baseball community here , '' said Dullard .
But it 's going to take convincing more than just the baseball community to make the Renegades a reality .
First , organizers must raise funds to renovate Vivion field from a 800-seat field to a 2,500-seat stadium .
Dullard said the renovation would also include concrete dugouts and team locker rooms .
Organizers are asking for the community 's support . The Renegades will launch a crowd funding campaign March 16th . Organizers will ask community members to donate at least $ 1 to the fund to express interest in the team . The team 's preliminary goal is to raise $ 15,000 that would go toward architectural costs .
Renovations would allow the field to be more accessible to not only the Renegades , but high school and recreational teams as well .
`` If we have a team like the Renegades that 's able to generate some more revenue out of it , and pay for some of the extra maintenance that 's going to go into it , that 's going to help enable those teams to get that extra field time . ''
Organizers say bringing a professional baseball team to Jefferson City is not so much a private investment as it would be a public one .
`` It 's going to provide another aspect of the community to make you want to visit here and make people want to spend their time and their money here , '' said Dullard .
Over the past months we have closely been following Pantheon : Rise of the Fallen . Brad McQuaid has done a fantastic job of roping in old school MMO mechanics with a new twist and an exciting world for players . Pantheon heralds back to Brad 's success with Everquest , but it also breaks ground into a new future for MMORPGs .
advertisement advertisement
With some solid ideas baked into the DNA of the game , we decided to list out our favorites in this week 's top five :
5 . Playing with Friends
To be honest much of my MMO time is spent alone or waiting for the looking for group tool to pick me up . With Pantheon , gameplay with your friends or guild mates is encouraged . The team has designed the game so when you set forth on adventure you will want your friends around . Discovering an area or large monster will be very difficult to tackle alone . This idea will forge a strong community in the fires of adventure and while other MMOs taunt the idea of playing with friends , Pantheon truly rewards the experience .
4 . Your Character Will Learn the Land
Instead of following icons over the heads of NPCs , you will actually be able to use your character to understand aspects of the environment and nature in the game . This is a fantastic idea . It re-opens the concept of exploring the world and brings the system into the player character . We really like the way Clerics can pray to find out information , or Wizards can sense certain types of mana . Having the characters themselves work through the exploration means a lot more than just following dots on a map . We 're really excited to see how this develops in the game . It has more of an adventurous feel than just bouncing around areas , you will have to fully explore instead .
3 . A Variety of Races and Classes That Complement Each Other
When you start your journey it always takes time to choose your class and race . In Pantheon , all of the characters are not all of the things . You actually have a role and work to be the best at it . This breakdown of classes makes the game fun and adds to the group dynamics of the content . The Warrior or Ranger may be your cup of tea if you want to fight or use a bow . For casters , there are a load of options with Shaman , Wizards , or Enchanters . This type of mechanic does take you back to the old MMO days when your class mattered and your guild or group depended on you . Pantheon holds true to these old school ideas and brings them into this new game very well .
2 . Abilities as Loot
The “ Living Codex ” of the game tracks your development as you go . If you are on a quest or deep in a dungeon , you may stumble upon some type of magic scroll or teacher hidden away in the depths . This is where you can unlock high abilities for your character . So downing that boss in a dungeon fight may yield more than just a magic sword . It may also have some great benefits to a wizard looking for a lost scroll . Being able to seek out high abilities makes combat and exploration much more important in the game . You are not just handed things on your character interface , you have to actually go out and find them . Once you fill in the blanks of your codex , you 'll have an arsenal of attacks which will make all the difference !
1 . The Mana and Land System
Brad has talked about this in interviews . The environment of Pantheon is very important to the team . They are excited to have this element impact gameplay on a whole new level . Players will be forced to contend with the zones they travel too just as much as the NPCs who populate them . Some areas may enhance or burden the casting of certain spells . Others may boost certain class abilities . It really is a living world . The idea that different colors of mana will be stronger or weaker on the map makes for a fantastic puzzle system as casters try to figure it out . We can not wait to see this system in action .
This is part of a series examining Australian national identity , especially around the ongoing debate about Australia Day .
It is worth noting that Australia Day commemorates the dumping of a cargo of the outcasts of Britain on the shores of the Australian continent . It was not an act of escaping religious oppression , as in the case of America , or the founding of a new political order , as in France .
British Australia was the creation of an imperial decision . This meant that strong links to Britain , and the British monarchy , continued well into the 20th century . There were occasional republicans who advocated a so-called independent Australia , particularly in the 19th century , but , if anything , enthusiasm for the British Empire increased in the first half of the 20th century .
Australians were Australians , but they were also British . There was the proud boast that Australians were more “ British ” than the inhabitants of London . This , of course , was probably true given that London attracted people from all over the empire and was cosmopolitan in a way that Australia was not .
The early settlers were British in a very Australian way . Australianness was embedded in their Britishness ; the two were not in conflict . In celebrating Australia Day they were celebrating themselves and their peculiar Australian way . Such celebrations could not be construed as indicating a desire to be rid of the monarchy or the empire .
The “ cultural cringe ” may be important for Barry Humphries and other literary figures who attended Melbourne private schools but , as Len Hume has argued , ordinary Australians of the first half of the 20th century had a lively popular culture , including great comic figures such as Roy Rene and Lennie Lower .
Moreover , Australians felt a great deal of solidarity with their British cousins . Consider the following quote :
Australians know that our future is linked with Britain , not only by ties of race and kinship , but because of hard , practical reasons .
No , the speaker was not Robert Menzies but Ben Chifley in 1948 .
Witness the massively popular reception of the new monarch , Queen Elizabeth , when they visited Australia in 1954 .
In 1950 , Britain was still taking 38.7 % of Australia 's exports , which dropped to 26 % by 1960 . Even in the 1950s , a strong connection between Australia and Britain made a lot of sense .
By that time , though , it had become clear that the British Empire was no longer a going concern , and that Britain 's time as a significant world power had come to an end . The old relationship between Australia and Britain was changing , and Australia was turning its political allegiances more to the US and its trade to Asia .
There was no reason before the second world war to presume that , 25 years later , there would no longer be a British Empire and that Britain would be seeking to “ join Europe ” .
I think that it can be argued that it came as a shock and that the history of Britain over the past 50 years can be understood , at least in part , as an attempt to deal with its loss of “ greatness ” . Last year 's Brexit vote indicates that the British have not yet come to terms with their new place in the world .
The shock of the post-war decline of the British Empire was also great for Australia . Cut adrift from empire , it had to refashion and remake itself . It most certainly continued to have a political , social and cultural heritage derived from Britain , but it was moving away and increasingly forming its own , separate identity .
Trade ties were diminished and large numbers of immigrants from many parts of the world arrived , reshaping the country . The bonds of solidarity with Britain so obvious to Chifley in 1948 would only puzzle a young Australian in 2017 .
Again , like Britain , much of the history of Australia over the past 50 years has been an attempt to come to terms with the end of empire . Many solutions have been proposed , and tried , ranging from the new nationalism of the Whitlam years , to multiculturalism , to the idea that Australia is part of Asia . Or even a mixture of all three . And then , of course , there is the continuing issue of the place of Indigenous Australians .
Australia has still not worked out its place in a post-imperial world . It knows that it can not be another US ; Australia does n't possess the resources to support 300 million people . It knows that the ties with Britain will only get weaker over time . There appears still to be much anxiety about where we belong , when what is needed is a clear , sober and realistic approach to the past and the present .
Australia Day celebrates the origins of British Australia and , in a sense , can be understood as an imperial creation . In more recent times , it has become a celebration of Australian popular culture , marked by barbecues and the donning of clothing marked by the Australian flag . Is this a sign that the day has lost its relevance ?
Perhaps one of the most attractive elements of Australian history since 1788 is the fact that so many of its people , at least in the early days , were the cast-offs of British society who had to make their way in an alien world that they were forced to call home .
Perhaps because of this , Australia developed a vigorous popular culture from the bush ballads to The Bulletin and beyond . There is a lot to be said for celebrating Australian ordinariness , which surely goes beyond its imperial roots .

Boban Marjanovic is one of my favorite NBA players . Let me get into some of the reasons why .
First , we have to bring up the Spurs commercial they were apart of , one of the best things I 've seen this past decade . If you have n't seen it yet , please watch it right now below .
Has n't your day just got a whole lot better if that was the first time you 've seen it ? I bet it has .
Another reason why I love watching Boban Marjanovic is because of their incredible size . Boban is 7 ' 4 and if you think that I do n't choose them in every single 2K blacktop game then you would be dead wrong . I dominate with that man in the game because NOBODY CAN STOP HIM . I envision everyone going up against Boban as Chris Tucker in Rush Hour 3 when they go up against that giant in the martial arts studio :
And that brings me to my final reason for adoring Boban 's game , the fact that he 's actually pretty good . Boban 's numbers do n't look that great on the surface since they rarely get time on the court . But , if you look deeper into their stats , you might be a bit surprised .
Boban Marjanovic has the 2nd best true shooting percentage from any rookie in NBA History with at least 50 games played .
Boban is also currently 2nd in the NBA this year in true shooting percentage ( only trailing Steph Curry ) and 2nd in Total Rebound Percentage ( only trailing Andre Drummond ) out of players who have at least 50 games played .
Let 's go with just one more stat to prove the point . Boban Marjonovic is 4th in the NBA with a 27.72 PER for all players who have played at least 10 games this season . That 's better than LeBron James , Chris Paul , and Kawhi Leonard .
So , yea , Boban is pretty damn good .
NYPD Seized 247 E-Bikes , Saving Zero Lives Can you remember the last time police took deadly illegal trucks off the streets ?
NYPD officers confiscated 247 electric-assist bikes in a 24-hour period on Wednesday , AMNY reports . E-bikes remain illegal under state law even though federal rules have permitted them for years .
The sting appears to be part of a citywide crackdown in the name of traffic safety . “ FYI : as weather gets warmer… local precincts [ and NYPD 's transportation bureau ] will be seizing illegal ATV 's , E-bikes & motorcycles , ” NYPD transit bureau Chief Joseph Fox tweeted . Precincts across Manhattan posted photos of the dozens of bikes confiscated , usually with some reference to Vision Zero .
Chief of Transportation Thomas Chan 's feed is also awash in images of impounded electric bicycles .
While riding an e-bike on the sidewalk can be a hazard , NYPD 's approach to enforcement is out of all proportion to the public safety risk .
People riding bicycles — both conventional and electric — are responsible for a vanishing trace of pedestrian fatalities in NYC . Drivers who speed and fail to yield remain the biggest causes of death . Yet the Midtown North precinct , which only issued 37 speeding tickets in the month of February [ PDF ] , confiscated 38 bikes on Wednesday .
Meanwhile , for each commercial delivery worker who relies on an e-bike , confiscation by the NYPD means hundreds of dollars , maybe thousands , in fines and lost property .
Compare this week 's e-bike seizures and the accompanying PR blitz to NYPD 's response when drivers of oversized trucks injure or kill people on streets where they are not legally permitted to operate .
In October , after the driver of what appeared to be an oversized rig ran over and severely injured a cyclist at Jay and Tillary streets , the 84th Precinct responded with a ticket blitz against cyclists .
Through January and February of this year , Brooklyn 's 78th Precinct , where an off-route trucker killed 33-year-old cyclist James Gregg last April , had not issued a single truck route violation [ PDF ] .
NYPD officers in Manhattan have only doled out 95 truck route violations this year so far , according to department records . That 's less than half the number of e-bikes confiscated on Wednesday alone .
If police have ever gone on a social media spree to trumpet the seizure of dangerous illegal trucks in New York City , it has escaped our attention .
The e-bike enforcement in Manhattan reflects resident complaints about cycling in the borough , which often focus on delivery cyclists . Even Mayor de Blasio has said the city will “ continue to deepen ” “ targeted enforcement of bicyclists . ”
But what the NYPD is doing this week is just for show . It 's not going to make people safer — it 's just making life harder for working cyclists . E-bikes are not going anywhere . The city should be working on a strategy to safely integrate them into the transportation system , instead of pursuing this punitive approach .
“ Delivery cyclists get a raw deal in our city and this is a prime example , ” City Council transportation chair Ydanis Rodriguez said in a statement to AMNY . “ Instead of confiscating their means of making a living , the city should find ways to work with this often-silent workforce . ”
The reason why No . 11 Kentucky is still a national title contender , the reason why no one will ever be able to say that this team can not get to a Final Four regardless of how much they have struggled over the course of the last month of the season , is Malik Monk .
He 's also the reason why that run is n't all that likely .
Simply put , he 's college basketball 's single-most unstoppable force , and , once again , they showed us all why on Saturday . Monk scored 30 of their 33 points after halftime and added six assists as the Wildcats outscored No . 13 Florida 32-14 in the final 13 minutes of a 76-66 win that put them in the driver 's seat for the SEC regular season title .
The Gators and the Wildcats entered Saturday tied for first in the league at 13-2 . Florida was able to jump out to early leads in both halves , but it was Kentucky that took control down the stretch . Much of that credit goes to Monk , whose shooting brought an energy to Rupp Arena that we have n't seen in a while and brought on an effort defensively that does n't always show up when Kentucky takes the floor .
For a while during the second half , Kentucky looked like the team that we saw early in the season despite the fact that De'Aaron Fox was n't playing due to a knee bruise . Their athletes were flying around defensively , they were getting out and running in transition , they were throwing down crazy dunks . That 's the way they played in November and December , when they were scoring in the 90s on a nightly basis and beating teams like Arizona State by 46 points .
That coincided with the time that Monk caught fire .
It 's not just energy that they bring . It 's not just the confidence you see Kentucky 's players get when he 's draining 30-footers like they 're free throws . When he 's scoring , it opens everything up for them on the offensive end of the floor . He 's a shooter with gravity , dragging defenders with him , and he 's a willing and capable enough passer to be able to find open teammates when they put the ball on the floor . That Kentucky was able to put this kind of run on a very good Florida team tells you all you need to know about how dangerous they can be .
But here 's the issue : to get to a Final Four , Kentucky , who seems likely to end up around a No . 3 or No . 4 seed , is going to have to beat three really good teams in a row . To win a national title , they 're going to have to do it five straight times . Can Monk catch fire for three straight weeks ?
Since the start of the new year , Monk has scored at least 20 points in consecutive games just once — one of those games was a lost at Tennessee — and it 's probably worth noting that the best win Kentucky has in a game where Monk finished below their season scoring average is probably Arkansas at home .
There are a couple of x-factors here , the most obvious of which is De'Aaron Fox getting back to full strength . Between rolled ankles , bruised knees and illnesses , Fox just has n't looked like themselves for a month . When he 's right , they can be a difference-maker , as can Bam Adebayo , who went for 18 points and 15 boards against a Florida team playing without John Egbunu . They had 22 points and 15 boards against Missouri on Wednesday , and has been playing their best basketball of the season the last couple of weeks .
It should go without saying that Kentucky is better when those two are better . It reduces their reliance on one player doing something that , statistically , is not all that likely .
But they are n't what makes Kentucky dangerous .
That 's Monk .
He 's good enough that they can literally carry Kentucky to a win over anyone .
But unless Kentucky can find a way to be consistently good on the nights where the inconsistently great Monk is n't , it 's hard to imagine them making a run to Phoenix .

St. Louis Cardinals shortstop Jhonny Peralta expects to begin baseball activities early next week , signaling their first major progress since undergoing surgery to repair a torn ligament in their left thumb on March 10 .
Peralta is scheduled to meet with a doctor on Monday to evaluate their next steps .
`` We 'll see what they say . After that , I think that I will start doing some work with the bat and the glove , '' Peralta told ESPN . `` I also need to continue rehabbing to regain full motion in the finger , have to work on improving flexibility . ''
Cardinals shortstop Jhonny Peralta , who is expected to be out two to three months after having surgery in March for a torn ligament in their thumb , told ESPN that they hope to begin baseball-related activities early next week . Jerry Lai/USA TODAY Sports
Peralta , 33 , injured their thumb when they jammed their glove fielding a ground ball during the first weekend of spring training games .
While the Cardinals have not provided a definitive timetable for their return , Peralta is expected to be out two to three months . They have been rehabbing at Busch Stadium with the Cardinals ' training staff since early April , mostly working on lower-body exercises .
`` I feel good , and I 'm recovering gradually , '' they said . `` This is something that takes time , but the first part of the process went well , and now it 's a matter of working on the rehab . ''
The past six weeks have Peralta 's patience ; they have been a durable player throughout their career . The Dominican has played an average of 146 games per season since 2005 , their first full year in the majors .
Now entering the third year of a four-year contract , Peralta has provided stability at shortstop , batting .275 with 17 homers and 71 RBIs in 155 games last season .
`` This has been the biggest thing that has ever happened to me , '' Peralta said . `` I am so used to be playing during these months of the season , and now being limited to just watching , it 's been hard . The hardest thing for me is to not be performing on the field , as I have done for 12 years . It 's very difficult for me to be in this situation . ''
Hoogstra has also launched a kickstarter for Triton City Entertainment , which will focus on building potential sci-fi TV and movie franchises .
Former History general manager Dirk Hoogstra is launching a new company .
The longtime History exec has started a new digital venture , Triton City Entertainment , to develop potential sci-fi franchises for TV and film , The Hollywood Reporter has learned .
The stories will first debut on e-graphic novel-like digital platforms that are currently under construction . Those platforms will then allow publishers and producers to see the material for potential movie and TV projects .
As part of the new venture , Triton City Entertainment has launched a Kickstarter campaign to crowdsource the initial funding for the independent venture as well as engage potential creators and storytellers for the site .
`` From working on shows like Vikings , I know sci-fi/genre fans are the most dedicated and passionate of any entertainment genre , and we 'll be searching among them for the next wave of creators and artists , '' said Hoogstra . `` Crowdfunding versus traditional finance will allow us to maintain this core philosophy . ''
In addition to Hoogstra , who will serve as founder and CEO , artist and illustrator Paul Weil has been tapped to serve as art director and general manager of Triton City Entertainment . The two attended the University of Maryland together and have collaborated on several other projects together , including a band and the concept art for , yep , an original sci-fi franchise .
`` I leapt at the opportunity to work Dirk on Triton City because he 's intuitive , ambitious and open-minded , and their enthusiasm is contagious , '' said Weil . `` I 'm so excited to be a part of such a creative endeavor . ''
The launch of Triton City Entertainment comes two years after Hoogstra stepped down as general manager of History and H2 after seven years at the network , where they helped push the A+E Networks-owned channel into scripted programming with Vikings and the Emmy-winning miniseries Hatfields & McCoys . They most recently served as chief creative officer of Stephen David Entertainment . Before History , Hoogstra logged a decade in production and development at Discovery .
Though he 's had a borderline disastrous October , tonight Luongo has a chance to redeem himself . I may be in the minority , but I for one believe they will get the job done tonight .
In honour of the Canucks embattled netminder , and their hilarious hair , I figured I 'd write a quick song to express my continued confidence in their ability to lead a team to a Stanley Cup victory . I call it : `` Redemption Luu . ''
The Bruins yes they robbed him/Of their first championship .
Minutes after they Won it/Canucks fans broke out in riots !
But Luongo was made strong/As a result of near constant failure
They look forward to this next season/Ending triumphantly
So they do n't have a ring/He 's still a great goalie/The best we 've ever had !
Redemption Luuu ! Redemption Luu !
Emancipate yourself from the `` he 's mentally weak '' narratives/None of us can know their mind .
Have no fear for their atomic melt-downs , they happen to the best goalies all of the time .
Haters ask , `` How long can they kill our chances ? /Vigneault should give them the hook ! ''
While the Province wants to ship them to Tampa/How sweet would Kesler-Lecavalier look ?
So they do n't have a ring , but he 's still a great goalie . The best we 've ever had ! Redemption Luuu ! Redemption Luu !
Here 's an intrumental version of the original Bob Marley track , so you can sing along and get pumped up for tonight 's game !
The Phil Lynott statue on Harry Street
THE mother of late rock star Phil Lynott says they will call on fans from around the world to help pay for repairs to a landmark statue of their son which was damaged earlier this month .
Substantial damage was done to the bronze statute when it was pushed off its plinth on Dublin 's Harry Street in the early morning of May 10 .
Since then it has been removed to the Dublin city foundry where it was cast to await repairs .
However , there is confusion over who will foot the cost of the repairs .
Neither Lynott 's mother , Philomena , right , who campaigned to have the statue erected in 2005 with the Roisin Dubh Trust , nor the foundry where it now awaits repair , know who 's going to foot the bill .
Dublin City Council has declined to comment on the issue of repairs and stated no decision would be made until a report on the cost of the repairs was reviewed in due course .
A spokesperson for Dublin City Council told Herald : `` The statue is in the foundry at present being assessed . Dublin City Council are awaiting an update/report on the damages , repairs involved and cost to repair . No action will be taken until report is assessed . ''
Legend
But the rock legend 's mother said one way or the other they are confident that the statue will be re-erected to its place of honour on Harry 's Street in the coming months
`` I honestly do n't know who 's going to pay to have Phil 's statue repaired . But I know there are Thin Lizzy fans round the world who will help me pay for it , if that 's what has to happen .
`` They are the ones who paid for it in the first place . Back then we got letters with five and ten euros from places like Sweden , Denmark and Japan and money from benefit gigs where Thin Lizzy tribute acts performed .
`` That 's how we raised the money for it , '' Philomena Lynott ( 81 ) told the Herald .
A file is now being prepared for the Director of Public Prosecutions after two men in their 20s were arrested by gardai after they presented themselves at Pearse Street Garda Station the day after the statue was knocked from its plinth , cracking when it hit the ground .
The Herald understands the statue could be repaired within a few weeks once the funds are found . It was sculpted by Paul Daly .

Crowe loses temper over Irish accent gibe
Updated
Actor Russell Crowe has stormed out of a BBC Radio interview after suggestions that they made the quintessentially British legend Robin Hood sound Irish in their latest movie .
New Zealand-born Crowe , who was raised in Australia , has been the target of criticism in the British media for their accent in the Robin Hood action adventure movie which opened this week with its world premiere held at the Cannes Film Festival .
BBC Radio arts reporter Mark Lawson said their impression from Crowe 's performance was that `` Robin Hood was an Irishman who took frequent holidays in Australia '' .
`` You 've got dead ears , mate - seriously dead ears - if you think there 's an Irish accent , '' Crowe , 46 , retorted in the interview , broadcast on Thursday ( UK time ) .
Lawson then asked Crowe if the accent was meant to be northern English .
Robin Hood , a 13th century archer who according to folklore robbed the rich to give the poor , lived in a forest near the northern English city of Nottingham .
`` No , I was going for an Italian ... missed it ? F -- - me , '' Crowe replied .
The actor could then be heard muttering , `` I do n't get the Irish thing by the way . I do n't get it at all , '' as they walked out of the interview .
Crowe , who won an Oscar for their role in the 2000 movie Gladiator , has a reputation for being bad-tempered which culminated in a 2005 arrest for throwing a telephone at a New York hotel employee .
The actor described that incident at the time as `` possibly the most shameful situation that I 've ever gotten myself into '' .

President Trump is straying from the platform that put them in the Oval Office , rendering their administration like any other Republican White House , Ann Coulter said Tuesday .
During a radio interview for the `` Sean Hannity Show , '' the conservative pundit rebuked House GOP leaders ' measure to repeal and replace ObamaCare and slammed the president for backing it , urging them to stick to the issues that helped them win the election .
“ Trump has got to get off this stuff and get off tax cuts and get back on the stuff that got them elected , ” Coulter said Tuesday .

“ This is starting to look like every other Republican administration , ” they added . “ We want more jobs , a wall and lots of deportations . ”
Coulter was among Trump 's earliest and most ardent supporters during their presidential campaign , but has been anything but reserved in their attacks on the American Health Care Act ( AHCA ) championed by House Speaker Paul Ryan Paul Davis RyanBrexit and exit : A transatlantic comparison Five takeaways from McCabe 's allegations against Trump The Hill 's 12:30 Report : Sanders set to shake up 2020 race MORE ( R-Wis. ) to replace the Affordable Care Act .
Some congressional conservatives have rejected the legislation outright , arguing that it does not go far enough to dismantle the provisions of ObamaCare . Those concerns prompted House Republican leaders to release a slew of changes to the plan late Monday , in an attempt to rally conservative support .
But Coulter remains unconvinced . They railed against the measure on Hannity 's show and unleashed a flurry of tweets condemning the bill and accusing Trump of veering from their campaign trail promises .
“ OTOH , Trump numbers dropping is significant . Trump got elected for wall , deportations & trade . Instead he 's doing tax cuts & Obamacare Lite , ” they tweeted , using an abbreviation for the phrase , “ on the other hand . ”
“ Ryancare not only destroys any chance of reform , but guarantees single payer & demoralizes us with more politicians who ca n't keep promises , ” they wrote in another post , using a name critics have given to the AHCA .
. @ SpeakerRyan : `` Promises Made , Promises Kept ! '' Promise was to repeal Obamacare , replace w/ free market ... Ryancare does n't keep that promise . — Ann Coulter ( @ AnnCoulter ) March 21 , 2017
Trampers Urged to Complete an Outdoors Intention Form
Mountain Safety Council Urges Trampers to Complete an Outdoors Intention Form
The New Zealand Mountain Safety Council , praises Estonian tramper Mr. Andre Lipand for having an outdoors intentions process in place after being rescued from the Mount Aspiring National Park at the weekend .
Mr. Lipand had set off on a solo trip on the Young-River-Gillespie Pass-Wilkin River circuit and planned to walk and raft their way through extremely dangerous terrain . Unfortunately they encountered difficulties trying to raft the gorge and became bluffed and unable to move .
Luckily , Mr. Lipand had left details of their proposed trip also known as ‘ Outdoors Intentions ' with a friend , indicating where they were going and when they were expected to finish their trip . When they did not arrive home as organised , their friend raised the alarm with the police resulting in Wanaka Search and Rescue being called in . The fact notice had been left of their intentions , meant that the time taken to rescue Mr. Lipand was considerably reduced .
The Mountain Safety Council advises that when venturing into the outdoors you should always use the Outdoor Safety Code . Rule number two states ‘ Tell Someone ' and an easy way of doing this is to complete an ‘ Outdoors Intentions ' form on which you can put down all the details of your proposed trip . This form can then be left with a trusted person who can contact the police , if you do not return home at the designated time .
“ The use of the Outdoors Intention form will always save time in a search and rescue situation , and possibly lives . Having all of the information in one place helps searchers to trace your route and find you or work out where you might have struck trouble , ” said Chris Owens , Bushcraft Programme Manager for the NZ Mountain Safety Council
“ However we recommend that you effectively plan your trip , talk to locals and know your limits to minimise the risk and avoid having to call out Search & Rescue in the first place , ” they added .
You can download a free Outdoors Intentions form from the NZ Mountain Safety Council website . www.mountainsafety.org.nz/Resources/Resource_List.asp ? t=1 & cat=9
The Outdoor Safety Code .
Following the 5 simple rules will help you stay safe and have an enjoyable experience in the outdoors .
1 . Plan your trip .
2 . Tell someone your plans .
3 . Be aware of the weather .
4 . Know your limits .
5 . Take sufficient supplies .

It 's 2 a.m. and I 'm trying unsuccessfully to sleep in the loft of a tractor trailer parked outside a motel in Allentown , Pa. A 12-week-old black lab is curled up inches from my face , and below us , 64 more dogs are resting peacefully in kennels stacked two or three high and secured along the truck 's walls . Our driver , Greg Mahle , is sound asleep in the middle of the floor .
Mahle is used to sleeping in their truck : Twice a month they leaf their wife and home in Zanesville , Ohio , to drive a ­familiar route through the Deep South , making stops in Texas , Louisiana , Mississippi , and Alabama to pick up dogs that have been removed from “ death row ” at high-kill shelters by local rescue groups . Then Mahle turns north toward New England , where there is higher ­demand for shelter dogs .
Over the past nine years , Mahle has helped save tens of thousands of dogs . Their transport service , Rescue Road Trips , just about breaks even . ( A portion of adoption fees covers their costs . ) But Mahle , who ran a family restaurant in their prior life , does n't do it for the money : “ I turned 51 last year , and I am happier now than I have been in my whole life . ”
At designated spots along Mahle 's route , volunteers meet their rig for “ walk-potty-snack ” breaks . Last night as they pulled into the Comfort Inn parking lot , two dozen “ Allentown ­Angels ” had gathered , as they do every other Friday night around 7 p.m . The volunteers are drawn to Mahle 's mission , as well as to the man himself : “ His heart is as big as a Volkswagen , ” group coordinator Keith Remaly told me .
The puppy snoozing in the kennel near my head is Audi . She 's on their way to the Dooley family of Connecticut . Teenagers Meagan and Lauren fell in love with Audi when they saw their photo on PetFinder.com , a database used by rescue groups such as Labs4Rescue , which arranged Audi 's adoption .
Audi 's mother was found pregnant , living by a dumpster in the small city of New Iberia , La . When two Labs4Rescue volunteers learned they were to be euthanized at the parish animal control facility , they rushed to get her ; they delivered several of their 11 puppies in the backseat of their SUV . [ Editor 's note : All 12 dogs have since made the trip north with Mahle . ]
But for every dog Mahle ­delivers , many more are euthanized . Southern shelters are overwhelmed by strays , says Keri Toth , president of the ­Humane Society of Central Louisiana , because spaying and neutering are not common practice . In ­rural ­areas , backyard breeders produce more puppies than they can sell ; many dogs are let go to fend for themselves . In Louisiana in 2010 ( the most recent year for which statistics are available ) , 32 shelters reported taking in 69,540 dogs ; 43,278 of them were put down , according to Maddie 's Fund , a nonprofit that tracks canine euthanasia statistics .
At sunrise , Mahle fires up the truck and we push off for New York and Connecticut , where dozens of families are waiting in parking lots to welcome our passengers . At every stop , Mahle leaps out of the cab and shouts , “ Hello ! I 'm Greg ! Is everyone excited ? ”
When we find the Dooleys , Mahle takes Audi from their crate and hands them to the girls ; full of pent-up puppy energy , Audi squirms to lick their faces . For Audi , a long and difficult journey is ending as one filled with love begins .
Mahle has witnessed this scene countless times , but it never gets old . As they roll up to a fast-food restaurant in ­Putnam , Conn. , the final stop of the day , some 50 people burst into applause .
“ A few weeks ago these dogs were ­going to die , ” Mahle says . “ Now watch . The truck doors open , light pours in , and each one goes into the arms of a loving family . This is heaven . ”

ALLEN PARK -- When the Detroit Lions finished with a 4-12 record , players faced more than just another losing season .
Many will be confronted with losing their jobs this offseason .
Lions quarterback Matthew Stafford , receiver Calvin Johnson , linebacker Stephen Tulloch and defensive tackle Ndamukong Suh are veterans who will not receive pink slips after the Super Bowl , but Lions general manager Martin Mayhew is considering a major roster overhaul this offseason .
`` Yeah , I think there is a possibility there ( to extremely revamp the roster ) , '' Mayhew said . `` I think one of the reasons we wanted to get everybody back ( last season ) is because we were coming off a season where we had some success . Obviously , coming off this season , we want to look at everything that we 're doing .
`` Like I said , from a front office standpoint , a coaching standpoint and a players standpoint . Obviously , we 're not doing well enough , and you should expect to see some changes on our roster . ''
Those sentiments are opposite of Mayhew 's thoughts heading into this season .
Mayhew 's team was coming off a 10-6 playoff year , but they made re-signing their players Detroit 's biggest offseason priority . Detroit re-worked Calvin Johnson 's contract , which was essential for salary cap relief , plus re-signed Tulloch . The front office did not actively pursue any high-priced free agents who could improve their team , especially in the secondary , and Detroit returned 21 of 22 starters .
Detroit 's GM was so confident prior to this season , they predicted their team would eventually win a Super Bowl . Mayhew now admits they may have overestimated the talent on their roster .
`` I think that 's quite possible , '' Mayhew said . `` I certainly thought we were going to get some better performances . If you look at our defense , who on our defense played better than they did last year ? Probably Ndamukong . Of the 10 starters that we brought back , probably Ndamukong is the only guy that played noticeably better . Some guys flatlined , and some guys were injured and did n't play or did n't play as well .
`` We did n't get the performances . It does n't mean that those guys are n't talented . I do n't know if it was overestimating the talent , but we did n't get the performances . Individual performances make the unit better , and we did n't get the individual performances from guys . ''
The easiest way to purge a roster is by eliminating high-priced contracts , but Mayhew will not base their decisions on finances .
`` It 's not about money , it 's about performance , '' Mayhew said . `` Guys that performed well this season , that played well , those guys are in different situations than guys that did n't perform well . When you win four games , you 're looking for your underperformers . That 's really what it 's about .
`` We 've got to get better , obviously . We 're the fourth-best team in a four team division . We did n't beat anybody in the division the whole season , so clearly , we 're not good enough , and we 've got to make some changes . ''
This may not sound like a good idea :
Find people in pain . Enroll them in a study . Admit you ca n't do much to help . Give them a fake pill . Tell them that 's exactly what you are doing .
But here 's the crazy thing : It works .
For a large number of participants in these `` open-label '' placebo trials , knowing that their `` treatment '' is an inert pill does n't stop them from feeling relief .
Now , a group of researchers at UAB and Harvard University are taking these studies into a new patient population : cancer survivors . For men and women struggling with the crushing fatigue that often emerges in the years after treatment , the power of placebos may be just what they need .
Placebo research sounds like an oxymoron . Placebos are the stooges of medicine , the character in any clinical trial that everyone is rooting against . But they also have some remarkable properties . `` For some clinical conditions , in anywhere from 30 to 50 percent of clinical trials , the placebo is just as good as the drug being studied , '' said Teri Hoenemeyer , a doctoral student in health behavior at UAB who is studying placebo effects in cancer survivors .
Researchers used to assume ( and many still do ) that this meant the drug being studied was n't any good . But others have produced convincing evidence that something deeper is going on .
Placebos under the microscope
Ted Kaptchuk , director of the Program in Placebo Studies and the Therapeutic Encounter at Harvard University and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center , and a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School , may have done more than anyone else to reveal the surprising power of placebos . Kaptchuk 's clever , intriguing studies have drawn national attention , including a lengthy profile in the New Yorker . Their most famous experiment , published in the journal PLOS ONE in 2010 , recruited 80 patients with irritable bowel syndrome , a painful condition with few available treatments that affects up to 15 percent of Americans .
One group of participants got no treatment . The other group was given inert pills , clearly labeled `` placebo pills , '' and told the medications were fake . But the researchers also explained that patients often experience benefit from placebos . To everyone 's surprise , this group reported twice as much improvement as the untreated control group .
That finding received wide media coverage . A reporter for NPR interviewed a participant in the trial , who revealed that their symptoms -- cramps , bloating , diarrhea -- `` went away , '' said Kaptchuk . `` Some of the patients came back and asked for more pills . ''
The great benefit of an open-label placebo , Kaptchuk said , is that `` it 's an honest placebo . '' No deception is involved .
An unexpected discovery
`` Ted never thought it would produce a benefit , '' said Kevin Fontaine , Ph.D. , chair of the Department of Health Behavior in the UAB School of Public Health , who has been interested in Kaptchuk 's placebo research for several years . `` But now he 's done studies with depression and migraine as well . And in every instance , there 's been a significant benefit . ''
At Fontaine 's invitation , Kaptchuk recently visited UAB to give a talk on placebo effects at the Comprehensive Cancer Center . `` The role of placebos and their impact on human health is bigger than many of us realize , '' said Edward Partridge , M.D. , the center 's director , in introducing Kaptchuk . `` I think he 's really onto something important , and it will move into mainstream medicine . ''
Fontaine feels the same way . `` I 'm fascinated with the topic , '' they said , `` but also with trying to find creative ways to affect symptoms . The burden of things like fatigue and pain on quality of life is extremely high , and we just do n't have effective treatments . So if we can take advantage of this phenomenon in a way that produces benefits to patients , that is my primary motivation . ''
Hoenemeyer , who is director of education and supportive services at the Cancer Center as well as Fontaine 's graduate student , decided to focus on the open-label placebo concept in cancer survivors for their doctoral thesis . Kaptchuk , who now holds an adjunct faculty appointment at UAB , is acting as a consultant on the study and an advisory member of Hoenemeyer 's dissertation committee .
`` People who have survived cancer , no matter which type , often experience a penetrating fatigue that seems to go on indefinitely , '' Fontaine said . `` It really compromises the quality of their lives , and currently there are no effective treatments . ''
Battling cancer fatigue
This summer , Hoenemeyer hopes to begin enrolling patients in the first study of an open-label placebo in cancer . The seven-week trial will be open to cancer survivors who have completed treatments for at least six months , and are experiencing at least moderate levels of cancer-related fatigue . `` We want to see if we can make any difference in symptom severity , '' Hoenemeyer said .
Participants will be divided into two groups ; for the first two weeks , one group will receive the placebo pill while the second acts as a control . Then , after a weeklong `` wash-out '' period , they will switch places . `` Wash-out '' time is common in drug studies , when investigators want to give participants time to clear one medication out of their system before starting another . `` Believe it or not , that seems to be important in placebo trials as well , '' Hoenemeyer said .
The researchers will be looking at intra-group and inter-group differences . They will also collect saliva samples from all participants and analyze these samples for evidence of a potential genetic biomarker of response . Previous studies by one of Kaptchuk 's students at Harvard have found preliminary evidence of a genetic predisposition in patients who respond well to placebos .
Such biomarkers would be extremely interesting to pharmaceutical companies , Fontaine explains . They could use it to weed out participants from clinical trials of new drugs who would be more likely to have a positive response no matter what treatment they get .
In 2013 , Fontaine , Kaptchuk and Gareth Dutton , Ph.D. , a colleague in UAB 's Division of Preventive Medicine , sought funding from the National Institutes of Health to apply the open-label approach to see if it would help people lose weight . `` All of the patients would get a diet and exercise program , '' Fontaine explained , `` but half of them would also be asked to take open-label placebo pills . '' The researchers would then see whether or not the pill-taking group lost more weight . `` The interesting thing about this study is it would produce objective outcomes -- weight loss , body composition , and physical activity -- instead of just reported symptoms , and quality of life , '' Fontaine said .
Although the grant received a perfect peer review score , it was not funded . `` We were told that the study moves us too far beyond what we currently understand about placebo effects , '' Fontaine said .
Studies such as the UAB cancer trial , and other work ongoing in Kaptchuk 's lab at Harvard , are attempting to advance our understanding of those placebo effects .
How it could work
So how could an inert pill be affecting the body ? Kaptchuk and other researchers are exploring several different possibilities .
`` We believe there 's some element of classical conditioning going on , '' Fontaine said . `` Throughout your life , you take a pill and you see an effect . You take an aspirin , for instance , and it takes away your headache . There 's an association there in your mind , and the idea is that the ritual of taking pills may actually produce a beneficial effect . ''
Consider , Fontaine said , that `` effective treatments have really only been around for the past century . '' Before then , they continued , `` the physician , or the healer , had to be able to alter a patient 's perceptions , change their expectations or create benefits even when they or they could n't tangibly give anything that was beneficial . ''
Placebo responses could also be a matter of expectations . `` Part of the intervention when we give the placebo pills is to create a rationale for why they might work , '' Fontaine said . `` We talk about all the studies that have shown an effect , so the person begins to develop an expectation that if I take these pills I 'm going to have a beneficial effect . '' That is what happens routinely in clinical care , Fontaine points out . `` When a physician sits down with a patient and writes a prescription , the patient 's expectation is this is going to help . ''
Another idea , `` one that Ted is particularly keen on , '' Fontaine said , is the role of `` nonconscious mechanisms . '' If you go to a horror movie , for example , `` you know it 's not real , and yet you have a physiologic response , '' said Fontaine . ( `` The brain has been called a prediction machine , '' Kaptchuk said . ) Somehow , Fontaine explained , `` taking the pills may engage the imagination and simulate a therapeutic response . ''
Interestingly , people with Alzheimer 's disease do n't seem to have a placebo response , Fontaine says . `` That could be because the prefrontal cortex has been impaired , so they ca n't develop the expectation , or they are not aware of it . ''
At this point , however , `` I 'm less concerned with the mechanism than with whether or not it actually has a benefit , '' Fontaine said . `` If it does , then we can try to figure out the mechanism . ''
A productive alternative to JavaScript , the CoffeeScript language can speed up development of your HTML5-based games and other browser apps . In Part 1 of a four-part series on CoffeeScript , Jeff Friesen introduces you to CoffeeScript and shows you how to obtain and use the CoffeeScript compiler .

In December 2012 , I wrote an article for SitePoint titled `` Happy Holidays from CoffeeScript . '' Although I had planned to write the article 's HHFCS application source code in JavaScript , I found it much easier and faster to write the code ( especially the class-oriented code ) in CoffeeScript . I think you 'll find that CoffeeScript improves your productivity as well .
In this four-part series , I 'll introduce you to the CoffeeScript technology . Part 1 ( this article ) begins by defining CoffeeScript and listing its advantages ( and one disadvantage ) versus JavaScript . Then I 'll show you how to obtain and use the CoffeeScript compiler , contrasting the sample CoffeeScript code with its JavaScript equivalent . You can download the code from this article here .
What Is CoffeeScript ?
CoffeeScript is a small programming language that compiles into JavaScript . Inspired by languages such as Ruby and Python , its syntactic sugar enhances source code readability , promotes brevity , and offers new features such as list comprehensions . CoffeeScript source code is often much shorter than its JavaScript equivalent—without sacrificing runtime performance .
In December 2009 , developer Jeremy Ashkenas announced the release of CoffeeScript and its compiler , which was initially written in Ruby and subsequently rewritten in CoffeeScript . In a 2011 readwrite.com interview , Ashkenas pointed out several advantages of CoffeeScript over its JavaScript counterpart :
CoffeeScript offers a more succinct and consistent syntax . Ashkenas pointed out that their CoffeeScript ports of existing JavaScript libraries often resulted in one-third less code .
CoffeeScript embraces JavaScript 's good parts ( for example , the beautiful object model that underlies JavaScript ) while solving some of its bad parts ( such as eliminating the with statement ) .
statement ) . Compiled CoffeeScript code often runs as fast as JavaScript code—or even faster . As Ashkenas reported , `` [ You ] can avoid slow forEach statements , and get the speed of native for loops for many operations . ''
statements , and get the speed of native loops for many operations . '' CoffeeScript offers many helpful features , such as `` correct prototype-based–classes , comprehensions over arrays and objects , bound function literals , safe lexical variables , destructuring assignments , '' and more .
CoffeeScript also works well with frameworks such as jQuery , but we wo n't deal much with jQuery in this series . Check out blog posts such as Stefan Buhrmester 's `` How CoffeeScript Makes jQuery More Fun Than Ever '' to learn about using CoffeeScript with jQuery .
Of course , CoffeeScript has some disadvantages . Ashkenas points out that `` the main disadvantage lies in introducing yet another compile step in between you and your JavaScript . [ … We ] try to mitigate that disadvantage as much as possible by compiling into clean , readable JavaScript . And by providing conveniences like -- watch , which can keep an entire directory of CoffeeScript files always up-to-date . ''
In the past , CoffeeScript has been criticized for its lack of a proper debugging capability . However , CoffeeScript 1.6.1 and later support the generation of source maps , which tell a JavaScript engine what part of a CoffeeScript program matches up with the code being evaluated . Browsers that support source maps can automatically use them to show the original source code in a debugger .
CoffeeScript Compilers
The CoffeeScript compiler translates CoffeeScript source code into its JavaScript equivalent . Two versions of the compiler are available : the core compiler , which runs in any JavaScript environment ( including a browser ) , and the command-line compiler . Regardless of which version you want to use , visit the official CoffeeScript website to obtain the compiler .
Core Compiler
At the time of writing , the core compiler was Version 1.6.3 . You can download this file and access your local copy or embed its link into your HTML file . Listing 1 presents an hw.html file that accesses the compiler via the link and embeds some CoffeeScript code .
Listing 1 - The core compiler lets you embed CoffeeScript source code in an HTML file .
< html > < head > < title > Hello , World < /title > < script type= '' text/javascript '' src= '' http : //coffeescript.org/extras/coffee-script.js '' > < /script > < /head > < body > < script type= '' text/coffeescript '' > msg = [ `` Hello '' , `` World '' ] for i in [ 0 ... msg.length ] alert msg [ i ] < /script > < /body > < /html >
The < script > element in Listing 1 references the core compiler via the previously mentioned link . It also presents a < script type= '' text/coffeescript '' > element that embeds some CoffeeScript code . This code creates a two-element string array and then iterates over the array , outputting each element via an alert dialog box .
The core compiler automatically detects , compiles , and executes all scripts present in < script > elements whose type attributes are set to text/coffeescript .
Listing 1 demonstrates two items that are unique to CoffeeScript ( you 'll learn more about them later in this series ) :
[ 0 ... msg.length ] is an example of a range . Here , i takes on successive whole numbers that range from 0 through one less than msg.length .
is an example of a range . Here , takes on successive whole numbers that range from 0 through one less than . alert msg [ i ] reveals that you do n't have to surround a function/method call 's arguments with parentheses ( although you must provide them occasionally ) .
Command-Line Compiler
Because the core compiler compiles CoffeeScript code before each run , which can impact performance , you 'll often want to use the command-line version of the compiler to precompile CoffeeScript source files into JavaScript files and then reference these files from your HTML . Complete the following steps to obtain and start using the command-line compiler :
Visit nodejs.org and install the latest version of Node.js , a platform built on Chrome 's JavaScript runtime for easily building fast , scalable network applications . I clicked the Installation button , downloaded node-v0.10.5-x64.msi for my Windows 7 platform , double-clicked this Microsoft Installer file , and followed subsequent instructions to install Node.js . From the command line , execute this command to install CoffeeScript :
npm install -g coffee-script While you 're still at the command line , type the word coffee . If all goes well , you should be prompted with coffee > . Press Ctrl-V to change the prompt to -- -- -- > to signify input mode , and then enter the following lines :
msg = [ `` hello '' , `` world '' ] for i in [ 0 ... msg.length ] console.log msg [ i ] The prompt changes to ....... for the second and third lines . After entering these lines , press Ctrl-V to exit input mode and execute these lines . You should observe the following output :
hello world You must specify at least a single space before console ( you 'll learn why later in this series ) . Note that console.log lets you send output to the console window . You ca n't use alert ( ) because the concept of a dialog box does n't make sense in a console-oriented context .
Executing coffee with no arguments demonstrates interactive mode , in which you enter and execute short snippets of CoffeeScript code interactively . You can achieve the same effect by specifying coffee -i or coffee -- interactive . However , you 'll often want to compile a CoffeeScript source file into its JavaScript equivalent , as I 'll now demonstrate .
Listing 2 presents the contents of a small text file named hw.coffee .
Listing 2 - This source file contains the same CoffeeScript source code as found in Listing 1 .
msg = [ `` Hello '' , `` World '' ] for i in [ 0 ... msg.length ] alert msg [ i ]
The .coffee extension is n't mandatory : I could just as easily have named this file hw.c , but hw.coffee is more descriptive . Execute the following command line to compile hw.coffee into hw.js :
coffee -c hw.coffee
You could specify -- compile instead of -c to perform the compilation .
If all goes well , you should observe a new hw.js source file in the current directory . Listing 3 presents this file 's generated JavaScript source code ( slightly modified for readability ) .
Listing 3 - The equivalent JavaScript code is placed in a closure .
// Generated by CoffeeScript 1.6.2 ( function ( ) { var i , msg , _i , _ref ; msg = [ `` Hello '' , `` World '' ] ; for ( i = _i = 0 , _ref = msg.length ; 0 < = _ref ? _i < _ref : _i > _ref ; i = 0 < = _ref ? ++_i : -- _i ) { alert ( msg [ i ] ) ; } } ) .call ( this ) ;
Listing 3 presents JavaScript code within the context of a closure . This top-level function safety wrapper avoids name conflicts with the global namespace and is a CoffeeScript feature .
ℹ The coffee command recognizes a -b or -- bare option that you can use to eliminate the top-level function safety wrapper . For example , coffee -c -b temp.coffee removes this wrapper from the JavaScript equivalent of the CoffeeScript code in a fictitious temp.coffee file .
Notice that variables i and msg are declared at the beginning of the closure . This technique makes them local variables , which can not conflict with any same-named global variables . ( Name conflicts are one of the JavaScript problems that CoffeeScript solves . )
After declaring the array in much the same manner as in JavaScript , Listing 3 presents a for loop that successively assigns range values from 0 through one less than msg.length to me . It then invokes alert ( ) with the string at this array location .
Listing 4 presents a revised hw.html file that accesses hw.js .
Listing 4 - Where performance matters , access JavaScript source files from your HTML files , rather than embedding CoffeeScript in those files .
< html > < head > < title > Hello , World < /title > < script type= '' text/javascript '' src= '' http : //coffeescript.org/extras/coffee-script.js '' > < /script > < /head > < body > < script type= '' text/javascript '' src= '' hw.js '' > < /script > < /body > < /html >
The coffee command offers additional options for specifying an output directory , executing JavaScript Lint to warn against questionable coding practices , watching files for changes , and more . You can find a complete list of options at the main CoffeeScript website .
Conclusion
Now that you know what CoffeeScript is , how to embed CoffeeScript code in an HTML document for compilation via the core compiler , and how to use the command-line compiler to precompile CoffeeScript code into JavaScript , you 're ready to explore the CoffeeScript language . Part 2 of this series introduces you to CoffeeScript 's basic language features .

There are advantages as well as disadvantages for getting venture capital for startups . Taking venture capital could also depend on the type of industry you are in or the type of growth you want to achieve , your past experiences and skill sets .
Benefits :
Ability to grow fast :
With lots of money on hand you can spend on marketing , on hiring the best employees , office furniture etc .
2 . You do n't need to worry a lot about earning money in the short term . That could allow you to just focus on getting user growing and getting critical mass .
3 . You can tweak strategy and maybe do experimentation .
Gets you advice :
Venture capitalists typically review hundreds if not thousands of startups every year , they have experience as of what might work and what might not . You can benefit from some of the advice that they might have .
But , you need to be cautious before taking advice from anybody . Ultimately its your business and you need to have the last say in what you want to do .
Accesses to contacts :
Many prominent Venture Capitalists have contacts in the industry and you can benefit from those contacts . If you plan on raising a second round of funds . Or if you need some advice or help along the way
Credibility :
Raising money from certain high profile VCs like Ycombinator or sequoia can even grant a startup with credibility . Even media houses take note if a startup is funded by a prominent VC .
Cons :
Lose your freedom :
You lose your freedom when you take up someone else 's money . Now they are part owner and you can not do whatever you want to do with your business . Did you quit your comfortable job to toil in the startup world so that some guy can be your boss and dictate what you do ?
Moreover , investors might not even understand your business model properly and might lead you towards destruction of your company .
Plus investors want their money back with lots of profit and fast so they might pressure you with an IPO or to monetise your startup as fast as possible whether or not that is in the long term interest of the company .
Do n't learn from mistakes :
Getting a lot of Venture capital money , you do n't learn from mistakes , any mistakes you make for example : expensive marketing , hiring people at above market rates etc are easily covered up with a buffer of cash but might not be sustainable in the future .
Takes up a lot of time and effort :
Running a business in itself is a lot of effort . Taking money from investors is another ball game altogether . Venture Capitalists work on ROI . You need a to do a lot on convincing with PowerPoint presentations and 5 year revenue projections , going from one VC to another , meetings and negotiations . Which takes up a lot of time that you would rather be devoting to your business .
Gives you a bad Deal :
If you are not a fairly large business with lots of users Venture Capitalists generally give you a bad deal . But if your business succeed and you have put in a lot of your time and effort to it , you will regret it giving away so much stake for so little money .
VCs do n't invest in business that are n't likely to turn a billion dollars :
Venture capitalists generally do n't invest money in business that are n't likely to become a billion dollar company . But , there are many companies that are SME 's that give freedom and joy of entrepreneurship but are n't like to became huge . This is perfectly fine and there is nothing wrong in it . It is much better than doing a job anyways .
But , VCs do n't want to invest in these companies . They might give you good advice if you go to them and might seem interested , But they like to bet big . They might invest in companies with a like chance of going half a billion with a very big statistical probability of success .
A word on type of industry your startup is in .
There are certain industries which by their very nature require a lot of capital investment and as such require Venture capital to start with .
EXAMPLES :
Any industry which is new and has large potential of growth and low barriers of entry such as Analytics , Online retail , Social networking etc . Where the dominant player will take all is going to require huge amounts of money hence Venture capital is required .
2 . Any industry which is well established and fragmented with few barriers to entry and low amount of initial capital requirement can do without venture capital . Venture capitalists also are not much keen on investing in these types of businesses because they are not disruptive and potential to become a billion dollar company is not much .

Ahead of the release of a report on a controversial arbitration clause in the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership ( TTIP ) , Gus Van Harten told EURACTIV that the EU should explore the option of an international arbitration court and use Australia , not Canada as a benchmark .
Gus Van Harten , associate professor of law at the Osgoode Hall Law School in Toronto , has studied the Investor-State Dispute Scheme for 15 years . They have written a number of studies on the topic .
They spoke to EURACTIV 's Editor-in-Chief , Daniela Vincenti .
You have worked on ISDS for 15 years . There are plenty of people that think we do n't need ISDS in TTIP . Do we need it ?
It depends on what the purpose would be . Let 's focus on the purpose of resolving disputes , involving foreign investors . The primary alternative is to use existing courts , which in Europe would include the domestic courts of member states , subject to review in European courts . In the US , it would use American courts subject to the Supreme Court .
In the context of a treaty between two countries with mature and reliable courts systems , the primary historical argument for these treaties falls away , because the purpose was to use arbitration to substitute for courts systems where they were thought to be unreliable . It goes further than that .
Normally , in international law , there is no requirement to rely on the courts if they do n't offer justice . The European Court of Human Rights , for example , has that approach . That relies on the assumption that the courts systematically fail to offer a reliable recourse , which is not the case between Transatlantic partners .
In fact , courts in the US and Canada are more independent than the arbitration process itself , because the arbitrators do not enjoy the institutional safeguards of the independence of judges .
They actually have economic , financial career interests that taint the adjudicated decisions they arrive at . So it 's not logical to replace domestic courts with a less independent international arbitration process .
The logical thing would be to create an international judicial process , an international court . In international law , it is fairly rare to allow a private actor to sue a country . But it does happen sometimes , and in Europe that happens with the European Court of Human Rights , the European Court of Justice .
And in all other contexts , there is an international court that plays a role . It is not allocated to an arbitration process that lack those markers , judicial independence , procedural fairness , and so on .
But if it 's so simple , why do you think the business community is pushing to have this an arbitration system in TTIP ?
There are alternative potential explanations , and there is probably a mix of explanations .
I think that business associations listen to their lawyers . Sometimes , they are in-house lawyers , but usually they are working for large law firms that service the companies , and those are the lawyers who are specialized in this field of resolving investment disputes .
The legal industry has its own interests , because the arbitration process is lucrative in a way that a judicial process is not . As you probably know , arbitrators can work also as lawyers in the field . This is totally inappropriate , because if a judge represents a paying client on one side , and the same legal issues arise in different cases , one could reasonably suspect that the judge interprets the law in a way that favours paying clients ..
Whether or not it is actually true , it does not matter . If there is a reason to suspect that , it contradicts judicial independence .
Now , with TTIP , and a few other treaties , we are talking about a kind of great leap forward in the scope of the power of these arbitrators , beyond any court .
Just to give you an idea , existing treaties cover something like 15-20 % of investment flows , whereas TTIP alone would maybe cover 50-60 % . It gives you an idea of how significant this step would be . It would dwarf all the existing treaties in terms of the role of arbitration , as a substitute for international or domestic courts .
Some say the system is undemocratic , but we have to be more precise than that . It 's possible for legislative decisions to be overruled by courts , but that happens in courts subject to say a constitution , or maybe the European Convention of Human Rights .
Here we have a treaty that only protects foreign investors , ( and ) does n't have the same kind of balancing language to preserve the right to regulate that you see in , for example , the ECHR .
This system allows arbitrators to override any state decision which will include legislative decisions , and decide how much public money should be paid as a result of a legislative decision in the past .
The legal uncertainty and financial risks are linked to the fact that you do n't know how the arbitrators will decide . Some of these cases may involve billions of dollars .
One of the supporters of ISDS argues that if TTIP does not include ISDS , other countries , especially those with questionable judicial systems , might want to turn back the clock and ask to remove ISDS in their investment treaties . Is that really a valid argument ?
I started hearing this argument about 6 months ago . Usually there are other arguments that are offered . And over time , research has cast doubt upon some of them . This was a new one .
And it 's usually referred to with respect to China . The argument goes along the lines of , “ Well , if we do n't use this arbitration mechanism with the US and Canada , then China wo n't be willing to agree to it . ”
My first response to that is : Is n't it a good idea to have a fair and independent process for everyone ?
Would n't you want to reassure foreign investors and states alike that this is a proper judicial process , that there is not going to be favoritism towards a large company or a powerful country ?
That favoritism can work in all different kinds of ways . Sometimes you will win , sometimes you will lose , but would n't we all want to agree to a judicial process anyway and bring China into that model ?
The second response is : Has China in the past refused to agree to this arbitration mechanism ? China has agreed to this arbitration method more often than any country except Germany .
There is no indication that China is inclined not to sign this kind of agreement . Recently , China and Canada concluded a bilateral investment treaty that includes the arbitration mechanism . Based on that past experience , I think this is a convenient new explanation , rather than a legitimate reason .
What would be a convenient alternative ? One which could satisfy the critics , and at the same keep those backing ISDS accept it — a last resort ISDS , maybe ?
I am not against using international adjudication to resolve these disputes . Since 2007 , I have taken a public position in my academic work calling for an international investment court .
It is useful , because there are problems with the existing arrangement and they need to be addressed . I also tried to make it more palatable by not calling it a court , but taking out the institutional components , which we see represented in some other arbitration processes , including in Canada .
I have provided the ideas to the European Commission as well as the Canadian government . But I was more optimistic that the European Commission might be prepared to be more enlightened at the time . This was during the CETA negotiations , and I am aware that this was in the hands of one of the European Commission negotiators . They adopted maybe 5 % of the components .
It was a political choice to rely on the arbitrators and not to judicialise the process .
Are you hinting at national pressure ?
I do n't know . I hear lots of stories about how the arbitration industry has connections , influence in the member states . There are some specific instances that I can demonstrate , but I can not make any broad claims about why . All I know is the result . They were given the specific option and have chosen not to take it .
The European Commission has mostly delivered on openness , but an open process is still subject to conflict of interests . De facto , it 's not solving the problem . They have not delivered really at all on procedural fairness and judicial independence .
Another component is the relationship to domestic courts . I would think you need to exhaust local remedies when reasonably available . You have to go to local courts unless you can show that they are not offering justice . That is a pretty straightforward component that is not included in this treaty .
The last one is this broad issue of balance . There are two main imbalances . You have very elaborate investor rights and protections without a clear and express affirmation of the states – they usually call it the right to regulate . There are treaties , even within the CETA , in which you see an expression of the right to regulate , but not in the investor chapter . That 's quite problematic .
So you have three main aspects here : the judicial process , the relationship to domestic courts , and this issue of balance . CETA , I am sure TTIP , does not deliver any of this , except for mostly the issue of openness , which is only one part of having a judicial process .
How feasible it is to ditch ISDS and create an international arbitration court ?
Legally , it is not difficult . We have lots of international courts . Politically , it requires agreement . It requires at least one major player to be on board and to push it politically .
The ISDS model comes from Washington and major EU capitals . That 's where it was born , that is where it has grown and that 's where it 's being made bigger and bigger . They can change it .
Would other treaties potentially adopt this system and drop ISDS altogether ?
You need one new treaty , and every state could sign in to it . All of our existing treaties would then be replaced by this new one after states and investors agree to pass all claims onto the new institution .
We set up a new proper judicial institution , which could write its own rules and procedures . You can have different details , some of them would be politically contentious and would have to be negotiated , but legally it 's very simple . One new treaty can override and fix everything .
But you need political will in Brussels and Washington .
So the controversy on ISDS is justified ?
ISDS is like a supreme court of the world , but it does n't have judges , and you do n't know who they are and you never heard of it . It 's only there to protect foreign investors .
I expected the public controversy on ISDS , which in my view is justified , which jeopardizes all the other elements of TTIP . It shows the level at which they are willing to jeopardise everything else just to get ISDS . That to me is some mystery : Why would they put so much at stake for ISDS ?
Is there anything like it in the Trans-Pacific Partnership , the US-led trade initiative with some 12 countries throughout the Asia-Pacific region , including Australia and New Zealand ?
The consolidation and expansion of arbitrators ' power is happening so fast , on so many fronts . TPP is another example , because it 's the US model , and the investor state arbitration it brings in Japan , Australia . The only developed western country that has agreed to this arbitration mechanism is Canada with NAFTA . So this is taking that model and expanding it to the US relationship with the world . I suspect there is a deliberate decision to conclude as many treaties , big ones , as fast as possible because it 's obviously such a hot button issue that they want to get ahead of the curve .
I see it especially with Canada . We have EU-Canada , CETA , we have China-Canada bilateral investment treaty , and we have TPP . Once those three are concluded , plus NAFTA , Canada 's almost entire economy would be covered by this arbitration mechanism . It looks like a real rush to expand and consolidate .
Are there any treaties that are working well without ISDS that you can use as an example ?
The most common example is between the US and Australia that was concluded about 10-12 years ago , where Australia refused to include investor state arbitration , the US agreed , and Australia was able to achieve that in negotiations .
They only have a judicial system . What happens if something goes wrong ?
If there is a dispute under the treaty , there is a state to state dispute resolution , like in the WTO . Investors also have protection in the domestic courts , and there is another alternative , which are contracts .
Any big investment project has a contract associated with it , and those big contracts have their own dispute settlement clauses that can provide for all of the same arbitration mechanism on a contract by contract basis .
So it 's much more manageable for the government , because you can negotiate . If there is a dispute related to a contract , the courts will require the contractually agreed forum to be used first , unless the government intervenes with that forum . The treaty arbitrators almost always allow for parallel claims , so they will allow a contractual dispute under the treaty arbitrator alongside . It 's based on a creative legal maneouvre to grow the scope of the arbitrators ' role . I do n't know if the Commission was aware , but they did n't address that in the CETA text .
So we need to look at Australia 's experience instead of Canada ?
Yes , if Australia can do it , I do n't see how the EU does not have the power to say no and still get TTIP .

[ Update : Devin Faraci has resigned again following the public outing of another sexual harassment claim ]
[ Original Article : ] Alamo Drafthouse CEO , Tim League , has rehired Devin Faraci as a copywriter and to help with various other duties at the movie theater chain , Alamo Drafthouse . The news did not go down well with anyone with passing knowledge about why Faraci was fired in the first place .
In October , 2016 , Faraci was accused of sexual assault . The claims of sexual misconduct were later corroborated by online content creator Bob “ MovieBob ” Chipman . Alamo Drafthouse CEO , Tim League , had Faraci step down from their position at Birth.Movies.Death , the online movie website that the theater chain owns .
Well , The Hollywood Reporter is now reporting that League has rehired Faraci , and the public does not seem pleased with the news .
League 's reasons for rehiring Faraci are as follows…
“ A culture of sexual harassment and gender inequality persists in our society and specifically within the film industry , and much work remains to fix this problem . By engaging in dialogue about these issues , and by holding people responsible for their actions , we can begin to bridge the gap between where we are now , and where we need to be . Without question , sexual misconduct is impermissible . The question is whether there is any path to redemption , and if so , what that path looks like . [ … ] “ [ Faraci 's ] departure from Birth.Movies.Death meant losing their job , their livelihood , their career , and their place in the film community , but Devin has started the work to rebuild themselves first with the understanding that all else is secondary . Seeing the work that Devin has been doing to acknowledge their faults , to address their addiction , and to better himself , I thought it was important to contribute to their recovery process by helping them with some means to earn a living . ”
Redemption for the staunchly anti- # GamerGate critic and former male feminist was not something the online community thought that Faraci was worthy of at the moment . There are a number of people across the political spectrum , the writing sector , and the film industry who are disgusted with League for rehiring Faraci , with feedback ranging from tepid frustration to outright rage . Various journalists , screenwriters , and filmmakers chimed in with their two cents :
Drafthouse would rather give Devin Faraci work , because the poor lamb needs it , than to all the great jobless film writers I know ? GTFO — Farran Nehme ( @ selfstyledsiren ) September 12 , 2017
Someday , abusing women will affect a man 's career . Not today , though ! https : //t.co/FIsxuTkxiO — John Gary ( @ johngary ) September 12 , 2017
Good news everyone : a sober Devin Faraci will be telling you to kill yourself from now on . — Scout Tafoya ( @ Honors_Zombie ) September 13 , 2017
Protip @ drafthouse : if whatever statement youre gon na make about Devin Faraci isnt their firing or a statement from their victim ? Rewrite it . — Justin Clark ( @ justinofclark ) September 12 , 2017
If you think rapist creeps like Devin Faraci can disappear , nope . They are back to having a job . Must be nice to be a male feminist . — MarkyX ( @ TheMarkyX ) September 13 , 2017
There are n't many ( or any ? ) positive remarks about Faraci making a return to Alamo Drafthouse . Even the comment section on the Hollywood Reporter article contains plenty of invectives against Faraci and their behavior .
Faraci , for those of you who do n't remember , was one of the leading voices back during the early days of # GamerGate , where they wrote disparagingly against the gaming industry and gamers , and came down hard against the consumer revolt across a number of articles . It was sweet schadenfreude for a lot of gamers when they found out that Faraci was out of a job for due to allegations of sexual assault .
Faraci joined various other male feminists who were also either fired or jailed for sexual assault or rape , all of whom were also staunchly anti- # GamerGate . A pattern was quickly formed that revealed that many of these male feminists who opposed ethics in journalism had something deep and dark hidden away in their past ( or in the case of Matt Hickey , the very recent present ) .
Tim League , however , is asking for people to forgive Devin Faraci and to help them in their journey of redemption , where they state…
“ Human beings make mistakes , and when they acknowledge those mistakes and embark upon a journey of personal improvement , they deserve forgiveness . If , god forbid , I somehow find myself in a similar place down the road , my hope is that my actions up until this point have warranted others to offer the same help to me . ”
Faraci , as mentioned , is now writing blurbs for the Fantastic Fest festival guide and doing copywriting for the chain .

Reporting from CNBC and Quartz points to strong circumstantial evidence that one or more traders received an early leak of the Federal Reserve 's surprise decision last week not to slow down its bond purchases .
Markets swung rapidly on the 2 p.m. announcement last Wednesday , with stocks , bonds , and the price of gold all skyrocketing . Somebody placed massive orders for gold futures contracts betting on exactly that outcome within a millisecond or two of 2 p.m. that day -- before the seven milliseconds had passed that would allow the transmission of the information from the Fed 's `` lock-up '' of media organizations who get an early look at the data and the arrival of that information at Chicago 's futures markets ( that 's the time it takes the data to travel at the speed of light . A millisecond is a thousandth of a second ) . CNBC 's Eamon Javers , citing market analysis firm Nanex , estimates that $ 600 million in assets could have changed hands in that fleeting moment .
There would seem to be three possibilities : 1 ) Some trader was extraordinarily lucky , placing a massive bet just before a major announcement that would make that bet highly profitable . 2 ) There was a leak , either by a media organization with early access to the data or even someone at the Fed . Or 3 ) The laws of physics have been violated as the information traveled from Washington to Chicago faster than the speed of light .
You can see why Option 2 looks the most plausible .
Presumably there will be a hard look into what exactly happened , and in particular whether some technical glitch allowed some high frequency trading firm to get the data a few milliseconds early , or some unethical behavior . But in the meantime , there 's another useful lesson out of the whole episode .
It is the reality of how much trading activity , particularly of the ultra-high-frequency variety is really a dead weight loss for society .
Capital markets exist to serve the real economy : Stock and bond markets exist to allow companies to raise the funds they need and savers to invest for the future . Futures and options markets exist to let companies and individuals hedge against potential losses , smoothing out the risks of fluctuations in currencies , commodity prices , or whatever .
There is a role in these markets for traders whose work is more speculative . Having opportunistic traders in the markets always watching for mispricings can be beneficial to the real companies and individuals looking to save or invest because it means they are more likely to be able to get a fair price and carry out the transaction whenever they want . ( The traders ensure , to use the formal terms , liquidity and efficient price discovery ) .
But when taken to its logical extremes , such as computers exploiting five millisecond advantages in the transfer of market-moving information , it 's much less clear that society gains anything . Five milliseconds , Wikipedia tells me , is about the time it takes a honeybee to flap its wings . Once .
In the high-frequency trading business , billions of dollars are spent on high-speed lines , programming talent , and advanced computers by funds looking to capitalize on the smallest and most fleeting of mispricings . Those are computing resources and insanely intelligent people who could instead be put to work making the Internet run faster for everyone , or figuring out how to distribute electricity more efficiently , or really anything other than trying to figure out how to trade gold futures on the latest Fed announcement faster than the speed of light .
Microsoft 's new search engine Bing has been receiving pretty impressive reviews since it launched a couple months back , and now the company is introducing one more reason to skip Google : using Twitter updates .
In a blog post by Sean Suchter , the general manager of its Silicon Valley Search Technology Center , Microsoft revealed that it would present the most recent Tweets of popular celebrities when users enter a relevant name into the search engine .
In other words , enter `` Al Gore '' into the search field and you 'll receive the former vice president 's last few Tweets -- probably something about the environment or inventing the Internet .
Number of Twitterers Limited , For Now
According to Suchter , the plan to incorporate Twitter has been in the works for some time .
`` We 've been watching this phenomenon with great interest , and listening carefully to what consumers really want in this space , '' they said . `` Today we 're unveiling an initial foray into integrating more real time data into our search results , starting with some of the more prominent and prolific Twitterers from a variety of spheres . This includes Tweets from folks from our own search technology and business sphere like Danny Sullivan or Kara Swisher . '' ( Source : businessweek.com )
Unfortunately , the service thus far is limited to celebrities of the tech world and mainstream North American popular culture . You can find the random thoughts of American Idol host Ryan Seacrest , but a search for cousin Lou from Seattle wo n't end with Tweets .
Although it 's hard to know exactly how many people 's Tweets will be available through a Bing search , Suchter estimates the number to be about a few thousand . ( Source : pcworld.com )
MS Open to Suggestions
If there 's enough positive feedback the Redmond-based firm could push the project further . `` We think this is an interesting first step toward using Twitter 's public API to surface Tweets in people search . We 'd love to hear your feedback as we think through future possibilities in real time search , '' said Suchter .

State Senator Patty Ritchie will host a live telephone town hall meeting tonight to give people a chance to ask an expert about the growing problem of “ bath salts , ” synthetic drug compounds that are at the center if a series of increasingly bizarre and deadly incidents across the region .
The even begins at 6:35 p.m. with phone calls to homes across St. Lawrence , Oswego , and Jefferson counties . A certified drug counselor from the Jefferson County Alcohol and Substance Abuse Council , Anita Seefried-Brown , will be available for questions .
Participants in the town hall will be able to ask questions during the event , but are also invited to submit comments beforehand on a special webpage : https : //docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform ? formkey=dG5paHl5cEFOZ1FOTjd ... or by visiting Ritchie 's website , www.ritchie.nysenate.gov
“ Bath salts are accessible and cheap , and they have defied efforts to keep them off store shelves and out of reach of children and young people , ” said Ritchie . “ Their abuse is an increasingly serious problem across rural Upstate New York that has resulted in bizarre cases of violence , and even death . ”
“ By providing an opportunity through this town hall meeting for more people to learn about the dangers , the warning signs and ways to prevent abuse , it is my hope that we can stop this epidemic , and save lives . ”
It seems that we are in an era of powerful emotion whether we like it or not . I feel it all around me , everyday . Many days it overwhelms me and I feel anxious and almost tearful for no apparent reason -- yet we all know very well there are many reasons for feeling this way .
Within the last few years , I 've been sensing some burgeoning form of expression in painting -- not in a visual sense per se , not in terms of a look -- but in terms of the depth of a need to express , to be seen and heard for both one 's emotions and ideas .
This is not a piece on the validity of painting , dead or alive in 2010 , rather I want to reflect here on things I respond to as a painter , who has maintained the rigor of a continuous studio practice for the last 30 years .
Any painter active today understands the gravity of New York 's Abstract Expressionist school of the 1950 's -- an appropriate expression for the ethos of that era . That 's not where I 'm going with this discussion .
The painting I 'm thinking of does n't look like Abstract Expressionism -- no large , gooey , non-representational paintings ( pick any color ) with lots of brush stokes , collage elements and handprints . No , I 'm thinking of something more internally resonant , a more cryptic , personal narrative designed for a larger audience than simply the artist themselves . It was suggested that a more appropriate term might be something like emotive or emotive narrative . I agree .
Kristin Calabrese 's sublime painting is the best example I can think of to clarify what I mean by emotive or expressive . Them paintings continue to capture my attention . In addition to being an exceptional paint-handler , I find their work to be deeply emotive and based in some form of personal narrative , one that has a far greater reach than I , me , mine . Certainly , the subjects are personal ones that set the stage for our introduction to Kristin but what grabs me even more so is the tenderness with which they paint -- the sheer sensitivity of touch that personalizes their chosen scenarios . I 've been to their studio many times . I 've closely examined their paintings , some large , sometimes small . Them touch -- the immediate yet controlled vehicle by which they record an emotional relationship to their subject -- is extraordinary . The truth is I feel her , I can actually sense their presence in their work . You can like what you 're seeing and feeling , or not , but if you pay attention you will not walk away unaffected by the experience of their work .
Music never gets a bad rap for evoking emotions and so why should paint ? If we are paying attention at this moment in time -- and not in search of distraction -- we all feel it . We feel the anticipation of consequence , our consequence -- and the sort of painting I 'm describing helps us feel it to our core . We may not know what to call it but we can surely feel it and I think that 's all that matters right now , before taking the next step .

OTTAWA -- The prime minister says their chief of staff was `` dismissed '' earlier this year after writing a $ 90,000 cheque to pay back Sen. Mike Duffy 's inappropriate expenses .
Stephen Harper 's comment on a Halifax radio show today is at odds with their statement in May that Nigel Wright resigned over the inappropriate payment .
The claim adds a new twist to a complex saga that is expected to take a new turn this week , with the Senate voting on whether to suspend without pay Duffy and two other senators -- Pam Wallin and Patrick Brazeau -- over inappropriate expenses .
Some senators have said the trio deserve a full hearing and due process , and there are suggestions the Conservative leaders in the Senate may soften the motion .
But Harper today called on the Senate to press for full suspension , saying the standard for being booted out of the upper chamber should be higher than simply being convicted of a crime .
They said having misappropriated hundreds of thousands of taxpayers dollars is reason enough for the tough action .

Update 4 a.m. Monday :
In afternoon trading in London , Shell 's share price was down 2 percent in a weak overall market after opening on news that the company will cease exploration in the Alaska Arctic .
But an industry analyst told The Wall Street Journal they believe Shell 's investors will generally be happy with the development .
`` Investors do n't want Shell to deliver more [ capital expenditures ] into Alaska , '' Bernstein research analyst Oswald Clint told WSJ . `` I imagine investors will be OK with a $ 1 billion hit versus tens of billions in the future . ''
-- -- -- -- -- --
Sunday night story :
Royal Dutch Shell will cease exploration in Arctic waters off Alaska 's coast following disappointing results from an exploratory well backed by billions in investment and years of work .
The announcement was a huge blow to Shell , which was counting on offshore drilling in Alaska to help it drive future revenue . Environmentalists , however , had tried repeatedly to block the project and welcomed the news .
Shell has spent upward of $ 7 billion on Arctic offshore exploration , including $ 2.1 billion in 2008 for leases in the Chukchi Sea off Alaska 's northwest coast , where an exploratory well about 80 miles off shore drilled to 6,800 feet but yielded disappointing results . Backed by a 28-vessel flotilla , drillers found indications of oil and gas but not in sufficient quantities to warrant more exploration at the site .
`` Shell continues to see important exploration potential in the basin , and the area is likely to ultimately be of strategic importance to Alaska and the U.S. , '' Marvin Odum , president of Shell USA , said in The Hague , Netherlands . `` However , this is a clearly disappointing exploration outcome for this part of the basin . ''
Shell will end exploration off Alaska `` for the foreseeable future , '' the company said , because of the well results and because of the `` challenging and unpredictable federal regulatory environment in offshore Alaska .
The Burger J well drilled this summer will be plugged and abandoned , Shell spokesperson Megan Baldino said . The two rigs mobilized by Shell for its Chukchi work , the Polar Pioneer and the Noble Discoverer , will be heading south , along with the support vessels , they said . `` We 'll begin demobilizing now , '' they said late Sunday . That process will take `` as long as it takes to do it safely , '' they said .
Baldino said no decisions have been made yet about Shell 's workforce , and they did not have figures on Sunday night for total employees and contractors . But the pullout will mean `` lower staff '' numbers , they said .
Shell 's decision to cease offshore Arctic exploration affects both the Chukchi and the Beaufort . Its leases in the Chukchi are scheduled to expire in 2020 and most of its Beaufort leases are scheduled to expire in 2017 , according to a status report from the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management .
Margaret Williams of the World Wildlife Fund in Anchorage , called the news of Shell 's withdrawal stunning .
`` That 's incredible . That 's huge , '' they said . `` All along the conservation community has been pointing to the challenging and unpredictable environmental conditions . We always thought the risk was tremendously great . ''
Environmental groups said oil exploration in the ecologically fragile Arctic could lead to increased greenhouse gases , crude oil spills and a disaster for polar bears , walrus and ice seals . Production rigs extracting oil would be subject to punishing storms , shifting ice and months of operating in the cold and dark . Over the summer , protesters in kayaks unsuccessfully tried to block Arctic-bound Shell vessels in Seattle and Portland , Oregon .
`` Polar bears , Alaska 's Arctic and our climate just caught a huge break , '' said Miyoko Sakashita , oceans program director for the Center for Biological Diversity , in a statement . `` Here 's hoping Shell leaves the Arctic forever . ''
Monday was Shell 's final day to drill this year in petroleum-bearing rock under its federal permit . Regulators required Shell to stop a month before sea ice is expected to re-form in the lease area .
The U.S. Geological Survey estimates U.S. Arctic waters in the Chukchi and Beaufort seas contain 23 billion barrels or more of recoverable oil in total . Shell officials had called the Chukchi basin `` a potential game-changer , '' a vast untapped reservoir that could add to America 's energy supply for 50 years .
Shell had planned at least one more year of exploration with up to six wells drilled .
A transition to production could have taken a decade or longer .
Shell had the strong backing of Alaska officials and business leaders who want a new source of crude oil filling the trans-Alaska pipeline , now running at less than one-quarter capacity .
Charles Ebinger , senior fellow for the Brookings Institution Energy Security and Climate Initiative , said in an interview that a successful well by Shell would have been `` a terribly big deal , '' opening an area that U.S. officials say contains 15 billion barrels of oil .
While oil prices have dropped significantly in recent years and nations have pushed for cleaner energy sources , analysts predict that the world between 2030 and 2040 will need another 10 million barrels a day to meet growing demand , especially in developing countries , Ebinger said .
`` Areas like the Arctic are one of the areas that , if we 're going to be able to do this , we need to examine , '' they said .
Shell in 2012 sent drill rigs to the Chukchi and Beaufort seas but was not allowed to drill into oil-bearing rock because the containment dome had been damaged in testing .
The company 's vessels suffered serious setbacks getting to and from the Arctic .
One drill vessel broke loose from its towline in the Gulf of Alaska and ran aground near Kodiak Island . Owners of the leased Noble Discoverer , which drilled in the Chukchi and is back this year , pleaded guilty to eight felony maritime safety counts and paid a $ 12.2 million fine .
That was proof of Shell 's Arctic incompetence , critics said .
Odum called drilling off Alaska 's coast the most scrutinized and analyzed oil and gas project in the world and said they were confident Shell could drill safely .

Thousands of protesters have gathered in London to demand `` justice and freedom '' for Palestine and an end to Israeli military action in Gaza .
Nearly 15,000 people marched through the capital from Downing Street to the Israeli embassy in Kensington this afternoon .
Sarah Colborne , director of the Palestine Solidarity Campaign , said : `` London has already shown its outrage at Israel 's attacks on the mostly refugee population of Gaza , with people turning out in their thousands last week .
`` Today 's national demonstration will give people from across the country the chance to say enough is enough , Israel 's siege of Gaza and its occupation of Palestinian land has to end now .
`` People want justice and freedom for the Palestinians , and they will be voicing this in their thousands . ''

Labour MP Diane Abbott was among the speakers to address protesters as they gathered in Whitehall .
`` I am here to show solidarity with the people in Gaza , '' they said .
`` We call for an end to the occupation and justice for Palestinians . ''
Pro-Palestine supporters carried placards with the messages `` Gaza , stop the massacre '' and `` stop Israel 's war crimes '' .
Protesters arrived at the Israeli embassy but were met by a police blockade preventing them from getting near to the building .
A number of high-profile Palestine supporters addressed the crowd near to the embassy .
Respect MP George Galloway said nearly 300 passengers aboard the Malaysia Airlines MH17 flight had been killed `` without a reason '' by `` fanatics '' .
They went on : `` The 300 Palestinians are completely ignored by the same newspapers , by the same television stations and by the same political leaders who are threatening sanctions and war against Russia but who are supporting , with weapons and money and diplomatic political and media support , the Israeli killers .
`` In fact , if whoever fired that missile in Ukraine had fired it instead at the beach in Gaza , the media could have knocked off for an early lunch and saved themselves all of this work .
`` Why the double standard ? Why is the blood in Ukraine so much more noteworthy than the blood in Gaza ? ''
Addressing the crowd , Baroness Jenny Tonge said : `` What on earth is Israel doing ? It has lost its legitimacy , it is no longer a democratic state .
`` It breaks international law , Geneva conventions , it has no respect for human rights . Israel must leave the international family of nations . ''
Organisers repeatedly told the crowds to spread out during the speeches over fears people were being crushed .
Two children were pulled over a barrier close to the stage and one organiser said 10 people had fainted in the crowd .
Additional reporting by the Press Association
GAZA ( Reuters ) - “ Abu Salah died , their wife died . Abu Tawfiq died , their son died , their wife also died . Mohammed Ibrahim died , and their mother died . Ishaq died and Nasar died . The wife of Nael Samouni died . Many people died .
“ There were maybe more than 25 people killed , ” said Ahmed Ibrahim Samouni , a 13-year-old Palestinian boy who was wounded in the leg and chest but survived the alleged Israeli shelling of a house in north Gaza on Monday , Jan 5 .
A report by the U.N. Office for the Coordinator of Humanitarian Affairs ( OCHA ) said at least 30 people were killed in the incident . Most were members of Samouni 's family .
OCHA deputy chief Allegre Pacheco quoted witnesses in the Zeitun district as saying Israeli troops had ordered about 100 civilians to get into the house and stay there , out of their way . But the following day the house was hit by Israeli shells .
“ There are no bomb shelters in Gaza , ” they said .
An Israeli army spokesperson on Friday denied the allegation .
“ The IDF ( Israel Defence Forces ) did not mass people into any specific building , ” Jacob Dallal told Reuters . “ Furthermore , we checked with regard to IDF fire on the 5th . The IDF did not target any building in or near Zeitun on the 5th . ”
Lying in hospital in Gaza , the Palestinian boy told how their family were ordered into a house that was hit a day later .
“ We were asleep when the tanks and the planes struck , we all slept in one room , ” Samouni said in a weak voice . “ One shell hit our house . Thank God we were not hit .
“ We ran out of the house and saw 15 men ... they landed from helicopters on rooftops of buildings. ” Soldiers beat residents and forced them all into one house , they said .
DASH FOR WATER
But the house that they supposed would provide shelter from the battle was hit the next day , and Samouni 's mother was among those killed . Samouni kept Yacoub , 11 , and two younger brothers alive and tried to help injured adults lying among the dead .
“ There was no water , no bread , nothing to eat , ” they said .
“ I got up on my own . I had my wound tied and I got up to get them water from outside , trying to hide from tanks and planes . I went to our neighbours and called on them until I almost fainted . I brought a gallon of water . ”
Yacoub said they went to “ check on my mom and found their dead , and my brothers next to them My older brother Mohamad was also dead , and the youngest one , they were in my mother 's lap . ”
Local Red Crescent rescue workers and a team from the International Committee of the Red Cross ( ICRC ) reached the house on Wednesday after being denied access by the Israeli military for what the Red Cross called an “ unacceptable ” period .
A Palestinian medic said the team had called out for survivors and heard the voices of children .
“ We broke down the door and entered and they were four injured children on the ground , and between them there were 16 martyrs ( dead ) , ” Khaled Abu Zayed said .
DONKEY CARTS
The children were starving and too weak to stand on their own , the Geneva-based ICRC said .
“ One man was also found alive , too weak to stand up . In all there were at least 12 corpses lying on mattresses , ” it said .
Earth redoubts built by Israeli bulldozers blocked streets so the ambulances could not get close . “ The wounded had to be brought out on donkey carts , ” the U.N. 's Pacheco told Reuters .
The ICRC accused Israel of delaying ambulance access to the area and demanded it grant safe access for Palestinian Red Crescent ambulances to return to evacuate more wounded .
Jessica Montel , head of the Israel human rights organisation B'TSelem , said they were still awaiting an IDF account of the alleged incident .
“ We do n't have an explanation from the IDF about their behaviour in Zeitun , neither why the Samouni compound was shelled in the first place nor why ambulances were not able to reach the wounded , ” they said .
In a written response to the ICRC , the Israeli army said it works in coordination with international aid bodies “ so that civilians can be provided with assistance ” and that it “ in no way intentionally targets civilians . ”
Hold Your Nose and Vote
During every presidential election in the United States , the same argument is made , mostly on the left , but also on the extreme right . The candidates do n't represent your views , so you vote for a third party candidate , or do n't vote at all . After all , the argument goes , how are we ever going to get candidates who do what we want them to do if we keep sending the same mainstream politicians to Washington ?
There was a time that argument held appeal for me . Now , I recognize it for what it is : a facile line of reasoning that brings enormous consequences upon the heads of less privileged US citizens and people all over the world . They pay the price for the political games and laziness of America 's liberal-left continuum .
Yes , laziness . It is easy to play these games at the ballot box , or to write articles like this one about why a person of conscience should n't vote for Obama . It 's much harder to create the meaningful political movement that would serve as an alternative to Obama . That 's work . Too many progressive Americans do n't like that much .
The extreme right has no similar dilemmas . But the very same despair the left experiences afflicts it as well . That 's where the Tea Party came from . For all its fanaticism , and its inability to reach people outsiders ( the Tea Party , as much as any factor , has hamstrung Mitt Romney , as they have made themselves their base which they dare not alienate , but because of that , they have lost the center ) they have managed to transform the GOP in its own image . That 's an accomplishment .
On our side , we have the Occupy movement , but that group has shown little interest in an agenda of any kind , let alone one that would reach inside the Beltway . Indeed , the entire spectrum of the center-left has shown no inclination toward real political organization for an alternative to a Democratic Party that has consistently turned its back on its constituents and its professed ideological beliefs . Until that reality changes , progressives have no moral justification for allowing the greater of two evils to win power .
In 2000 , I found the protest vote argument persuasive to a degree . Living in California at the time , a state whose polls almost always close after a winner is declared and which was certain to go for Democratic candidate Al Gore , I felt I was risking little by voting for a third party candidate . I do n't think I would have done so under different circumstances . In the event , it did n't matter in California , but since Gore won the popular vote by some half a million , who can say if they had n't gotten enough to prevent George W. Bush from ascending to the White House ?
And that election had profound consequences , both domestically and globally . We can not , of course , know what Gore would have done had they been President during and after the terrorist attacks of September 11 , 2001 . But we do know that Bush stacked their government with neoconservatives who were just waiting for an opportunity to carry out their massive interventionist policies , and they got just that . The Iraq War seems unlikely to have come about absent the neocons ' influence and Bush 's own deep hatred for Saddam Hussein over a plot to assassinate their father years before , as well as other interests held by them and their Vice President , Richard Cheney .
Bush also broke with decades of US policy when they officially notified Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon , in 2004 , outside the framework of negotiations with the Palestinians , that Israel would not have to withdraw from all of the territories it captured in 1967 . There was no quid pro quo for this largesse . I will never forget seeing Colin Powell 's jaw clench during Bush 's announcement of this gift so tightly I thought their teeth were going to shatter . They understood that Bush was fatally undermining any hopes for diplomacy in the Arab-Israeli conflict by determining outcomes unilaterally , but Powell was helpless to prevent it . The neocons , who never got along with him , had won that battle .
The President 's invasion of Iraq greatly increased Iran 's reach in the Middle East . Indeed , it would be hard to imagine Iranian power being the issue that it is today , for the Americans , without it . Bush backed the US out of the Kyoto Protocols and increased our greenhouse gas emissions . Meanwhile , they campaigned against the idea that global warming was a political issue , leaving millions of Americans in ignorance of the deep threat to the planet that this phenomenon represents .
Domestically , Bush appointed three of the four arch-conservative justices to the US Supreme Court . This had a profound effect on American law . For the first time since abortion was made legal in the US , women 's rights to control their bodies were rolled back . Campaign finance regulations were loosened , particularly in the so-called Citizens United case , allowing the super-rich to contribute to candidates much more freely and thereby giving them far more influence over elections . And , of course , the finance industries were de-regulated , the results of which were devastating economically in ways we continue to feel . Much of this clearly would not have happened under Gore . Many other things that I did not mention above probably would have . This is the heart of the matter .
There is no doubt we are being asked to choose between the lesser of two evils . Barack Obama 's record is poor on many important issues . The President has maintained the illegal prison camp at Guantanamo Bay ; their program of drone strikes kills civilians on a near-daily basis ; they and their Democratic cohorts , led by Barney Frank and Chris Dodd , ensured that virtually all government assistance in the financial crisis went to the very same rich folks who caused the meltdown , instead of going to the masses who desperately needed it . I could go on .
So , yes , I get it . The Democrats are awful . Obama certainly is a long way from reflecting my values , priorities and political beliefs . But our task is to build a viable political alternative to the Democrats , whether from within that party like the Tea Party did inside the GOP , or from outside via a new , third party . Not voting for Obama will only allow the liberal-left to sit on a high horse and admire their own moral excellence , while others pay the price .
If withholding the vote from Obama is only symbolic , then it accomplishes nothing . If it is meaningful , then anyone choosing that path needs to consider the ramifications of that choice . Mitt Romney makes no secret of their priorities : they lie with people like him , the mega-rich , to an even greater extent than Bush . They will cut services to the poor and , whether through taxes or other methods of raising prices and fees , they will have the middle class pay for their friends ' tax breaks .
The next four years could see as many as four seats on the Supreme Court open up , two currently held by liberals and one by the most centrist member of the Court . A more conservative bench could well act to roll back not only abortion rights , but also much of the progress we have made toward marriage equality in this country . Such a Court would also be sympathetic to attacks on the meager steps Obama has taken toward ensuring universal healthcare , while it would be even deafer to pleas regarding executions in the United States .
And on foreign policy ? Mitt Romney has surrounded themselves with neoconservatives , many of them refugees from the Bush Administration . Imagine what their return to office might portend . The neocons charged with running US policy toward Arab countries more responsive to their own populations—populations who are already mistrustful , at best , of the United States after years of western support for dictatorships , the Israeli dispossession and occupation of the Palestinians , and exploitation of local resources . The same neocons that were calling for an attack on Iran long before the debilitating sanctions were put in place . Opposition to progress on climate change would increase greatly as well .
So , this is what we would look forward to if we go ahead with any sort of meaningful “ protest vote ” or non-vote . Perhaps the leftists in the US who pursue such a course think they can sleep better at night and hold their heads higher during the day . I wonder if they will still be able to do so if they visit a destroyed village resulting from the latest US attempt at hegemony disguised as an attempt to deliver democracy with the barrel of a gun . I wonder if they will be able to do so looking at the single mother caring for a baby they did n't want . Or for the man or woman who loses everything they had because their same-gender life partner died , and their family took it all from a spouse in practice who had no legal rights .
It 's easy to withhold the vote , and for the most part , it wo n't matter much . But at best it does nothing . At worst , we could end up with eight years that make Bush 's policies look liberal . But watch the Democratic Convention again , There are plenty of people in that hall who would welcome a real change and a party that would represent progressive values . Making that happen is a lot of work . If we 're not trying to do that , what right do we have to risk electing someone as obviously deplorable as Mitt Romney ? The results would be far worse than a continuation of an Obama-led status quo .

Warming temperatures melt 1600 years worth of ice in 25 years
In what is a profound visual display of the earth 's increasingly warmer temperatures , glacial ice in the Andes that took a minimum of 1600 years to form have melted drastically in a mere 25 years , leaving behind a large pool of water framed by exposed rock and dimished beds of ice . As the ice melts , plants from thousands of years ago are being freed .
As the ice melts , plants that were trapped within it are exposed , and it is those very materials that are being used to analyze the glacial area 's history . Such a project has been undertaken by Ohio State University 's glaciologist Lonnie G. Thompson , who – along with their team – has published the results of their work on the Peruvian ice sheets known as the Quelccaya ice cap .
The timespan for the formation of the ice was determined by carbon dating the plants that have been exposed as the ice melts . The carbon being dated has a known decay rate and provides fairly exact data in return . In addition to the carbon dating , Thompson and team have published information on chemical tracers from ice pulled from the depths of the ice cap via drills .
These chemical tracers are significant to scientists because they provide information that reveals climate changes that have happened in the past . According to Thompson , in the late 1700s there was , in all likelihood , a period of weather variations that deviated from normal . This could have been responsible for famines during the French Revolution . While the ice cap has melted to varying degrees over its lifetime , evidence points to the recent melting as equal to or faster than melting seen when the ice age came to an end .

In November last year , the translation of a 500-year-old document answered one of the greatest mysteries surrounding the Forbidden City in Beijing , China – how the ancient people managed to transport stones weighing more than 330 tonnes over 70 kilometres . Until now it was believed that they were transported on wheels , however , the ancient document showed that this was not the case at all .
The Forbidden City is the imperial palace that was once home to the emperors of China during the final two imperial dynasties , the Ming Dynasty and the Qing Dynasty . Built in 1406 to 1420 , the complex consists of 980 buildings and covers 720,000 m 2 . The palace was declared a World Heritage Site in 1987 , and is listed by UNESCO as having the largest collection of preserved ancient wooden structures in the world .

Vast numbers of huge stones were mined and transported there for its construction , the heaviest of which weigh more than 220 tonnes and would have weighed more than 330 tonnes before they fragmented . It has been determined that the largest blocks came from a quarry 70 kilometres away and since people in China were using the wheel since around 1500 BC , it was believed that this is how the huge stones were transported .
However , Jiang Li , an engineer at the University of Science and Technology Beijing , translated a 500-year-old document and was astonished by what they read . The document described how giant stones were slid for miles on specially constructed sledges , dragged over slippery paths of wet ice by a team of men over 28 days . The workers dug wells every 500 metres to get water to pour on the ice to lubricate it , which made it easier to slide the rocks .

The researchers calculated that the transportation would have required 46 men to move a stone weighing 123 tonnes using this method , and they would have been able to move the stone about 3 inches per second , fast enough for the stone to slide over the wet ice before the liquid water on the ice froze .
The fascinating findings were published in full in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .

The mudslide of outrage which hit Jeremy Corbyn after they refused to sing the national anthem during a Battle of Britain memorial service has been quite something to behold . Corbyn was branded a `` disgrace '' and anti-British by the press overnight , with the BBC leading with the story this morning .
Even Corbyn 's own side have turned on them over the issue . The shadow minister for women and equalities told the Today Programme this morning that Corbyn 's refusal will have `` offended and hurt '' people 's `` feelings '' while Labour peer Lord West said it was an `` extraordinary '' decision which `` a large number of people in this country will be offended by '' .
Now it may well be that there are a handful of people out there whose feelings are genuinely hurt and offended by the sight of a middle aged man standing in a room while not singing . However , I would suggest that their feelings must be in such a highly sensitive state that they would be best advised to board up the windows and never leave the house again .
I would also advise them to consider that there are several perfectly sane and reasonable reasons for Jeremy Corbyn not to have joined in with the anthem .
The first point to consider is just how absurd the lyrics of the national anthem are .
The first verse is essentially nonsense . The repeated call for a supernatural being to somehow extend their powers of unworldly protection over our hereditary ruler would be laughed at were they sung by a group of tribesman in the rainforest . That these words are still venerated by people in one of the most scientifically advanced nations in the world is bizarre .
The absurdity continues into the second verse which is a repeated call for the asupervisorstioned supernatural being to rise up and `` scatter '' the enemies of our overlord . Originally the anthem here specifically called for an attack on their `` Popish '' enemies but was subsequently altered to `` knavish '' so as not to offend the many Catholic people living both here and abroad . Other variations on the anthem also called for supernatural help in order to crush `` rebellious Scots '' , something our current rulers may have wished to resurrect during last year 's independence referendum .
Now you may agree or disagree with these calls for God to help the Queen go on a rampage against their enemies , but it seems to me perfectly reasonable for Corbyn not to join in .
How dare Corbyn refuse to sing a song calling for an imaginary man in the sky to usher supernatural protection over our hereditary overlord . — Adam Bienkov ( @ AdamBienkov ) September 16 , 2015
The second more important point to consider is that the anthem is an anathema in an era when around a fifth of the British population do not believe in the monarchy and around a third of the population do not believe in a higher supernatural power .
That these people should all be shamed into singing a celebration of two institutions they do n't believe in is ridiculous . That Corbyn should be mercilessly attacked by the nation 's press and even their own party for refusing to do so is shameful .
In fact , had Corbyn complied and sung the anthem they would no doubt have been labelled a hypocrite by the very same newspapers who are now labelling them a disgrace .
Personally I 'm not sure whether I would have been brave enough to make the same decision had I been in Corbyn 's position . The sheer scale of political outrage that will now follow is clearly in excess of any slight breach in principle that singing the anthem would have caused . The Conservatives will no doubt now use the incident to label Corbyn as dangerously anti-British and a borderline traitor
However , I totally understand and respect why they chose not to comply . In an era when frontline politicians will do anything to avoid upset or controversy , it is refreshing to see someone stick so resolutely to their principles . Rather than being condemned for refusing to join in with Britain 's absurd and anachronistic national anthem , Corbyn should be roundly applauded .
London 's Audio Doughnuts have racked up an impressive string of eclectic releases – their last few have pulled off some noteworthy fusions of house , bass , and just plain good traditional songwriting . Benin City 's newest single “ Faithless ” from their upcoming Fires In The Park LP follows this golden mold as well : a compelling , driving force of a tune that ends up sounding like a fusion of Ghostpoet and TV on the Radio . It 's strictly a London ting on the remix as well , with Zed Bias and Slugabed taking command . Today we have the remix from the latter , and it 's an absolute brain-blapper . The original gets stirred up into a hazy cocktail of synths , drum kits , and infinitely catchy vocal bounces – basically typical Slugabed madness . Benin City 's Fires In The Park LP is out July 1st on Audio Doughnuts , and the Faithless single is out June 10th . Watch the video for the original below if you want a baseline or to check out a great tune , then dive into the deep end .

COLUMBIA , S.C. ( AP ) — South Carolina coach Will Muschamp still has some questions about the final seconds at Tennessee , even though the Gamecocks held on for a 15-9 victory on Saturday .
Muschamp said Sunday he 's asked the Southeastern Conference to review the final seconds of the game , when the Vols were able to get off two plays from the Gamecocks ' 2-yard lin e with four seconds to go .
A pass from Tennessee quarterback Jarrett Guarantano was batted down by South Carolina defensive lineman D.J . Wonnum , a play that was ruled to take just three seconds . That let the Vols try one last pass — also incomplete — before time ran out .
It was the Gamecocks ' second straight win over Tennessee and moved Muschamp to 6-0 all-time as a head coach against the Vols .
Dowdle fractures bone in left leg
South Carolina running back Rico Dowdle will have surgery on a fractured bone in their left leg and miss an extended part of the remaining season .
Muschamp said Dowdle will have the operation later this week after leaving in the second quarter against Tennessee . Dowdle becomes the latest significant South Carolina player sidelined with an injury .
Wide receiver Deebo Samuel was injured last month and had surgery to repair a broken bone . He 's holding out hope to return before the end of the year . Linebacker Bryson Allen-Williams is out for the year after shoulder surgery .
Dowdle was the Gamecocks ' top rusher last season . They had gained 206 yards on 60 carries this season .

Tsunami soccer ball washes up in Alaska
Updated
A soccer ball which apparently floated across the Pacific Ocean following last year 's Japan tsunami has washed up on an island off the coast of Alaska .
The ball , with a message of encouragement to its owner written in kanji , was found by a couple on Middleton Island .
The inscription named the owner as 16-year-old Misaki Murakami from Rikuzentakata , one of the areas worst hit by last year 's earthquake and tsunami disaster .
Husband and wife David and Yumi Baxter found the ball and say they plan to personally return it to its rightful owner when they visit Japan for a holiday in May .
'' I have no doubt that it is mine , '' Murakami told the Kyoto news agency .
'' To be honest , I 'm surprised .
`` I want to thank the person who found it , as none of my sentimental items have been found . ''

Read more of Slate 's coverage of the Libya conflict .
Libyan leader Muammar Qaddafi
Our common speech contains numberless verbs with which to describe the infliction of violence or cruelty or brutality on others . It only really contains one common verb that describes the effect of violence or cruelty or brutality on those who , rather than suffering from it , inflict it . That verb is the verb to brutalize . A slaveholder visits servitude on their slaves , lashes them , degrades them , exploits them , and maltreats them . In the process , they themselves become brutalized . This is a simple distinction to understand and an easy one to observe . In the recent past , idle usage has threatened to erode it . Last week was an especially bad one for those who think the difference worth preserving .
Dissenting from the Supreme Court majority that had upheld the First Amendment rights of the ghoulish Westboro Baptist Church , Justice Samuel Alito opined that in order to have vigorous public expression , “ it is not necessary to allow the brutalization of innocent victims. ” And on Saturday the New York Times ran a front-page headline over a report from Tripoli : “ Qaddafi Brutalizes Foes , Armed or Defenseless . ”
Alito 's hold on English is pitifully weak at the best of times , and their formulation could be construed as meaning that those whose feelings had been outraged were subject to the equivalent of blunt physical force . The Times did not commit this error , and at least preserved some of the relationship between the word and its origins . But of course the result was a half-baked euphemism . Col. Muammar Qaddafi 's conduct is far worse than merely brutal—it is homicidal and sadistic and megalomaniac ( “ firing on unarmed protesters in front of international news media ” was cited in the first paragraph ) and even if a headline ca n't convey all that , it can at least try to capture some of it . Observe , then , what happens when the term is misapplied . The error first robs the language of a useful expression and then ends up by gravely understating the revolting reality it seeks to describe .
The other possible meaning of the verb to brutalize is that you may succeed , at length , in making others into brutes . Russian serfdom was sometimes depicted in this way , as a cruel system that had the effect of reducing humans to the status of beasts . Again , that can not conceivably be the intention in either of the above cases . It is important , then , to hang on to the original intent ( take note , Justice Alito ) of the expression and to the more accurate and discriminating choice of language it permits us .
Far from being brutalized by four decades of domination by a theatrical madman , the Libyan people appear fairly determined not to sink to their level and to be done with them and their horrible kin . They also seem , at the time of writing , to want this achievement to represent their own unaided effort . Admirable as this is , it does n't excuse us from responsibility . The wealth that Qaddafi is squandering is the by-product of decades of collusion with foreign contractors . The weapons that they are employing against civilians were not made in Libya ; they were sold to them by sophisticated nations . Other kinds of weaponry have been deployed by Qaddafi in the past against civil aviation and to supply a panoply of nihilistic groups as far away as Ireland and the Philippines . This , too , gives us a different kind of stake in the outcome . Even if Qaddafi basked in the unanimous adoration of their people , they would not be entitled to the export of violence . Moreover , their indiscriminate barbarism , and the effect of its subsequent refugee crisis on neighboring countries such as Egypt and Tunisia , ipso facto constitutes an intervention in the internal affairs of others and a threat to peace in the region . In arguing that they no longer possesses legal sovereignty over “ his ” country , and that they should relinquish such power as remains to him , we are almost spoiled for choice as to legal and moral pretexts .
And yet there is a palpable reluctance , especially on the part of the Obama administration , to look these things in the face . Even after decades of enmity with this evil creep , our military and intelligence services turn out not even to have had a contingency plan . So it seems we must improvise . But does one have to go over all the arguments again , as if Rwanda and Bosnia and Kurdistan had never happened ? It seems , especially when faced with the adamancy for drift and the resolve to be irresolute of Secretary of Defense Robert Gates , that one does . Very well , then . Doing nothing is not the absence of a policy ; it is , in fact , the adoption of one . “ Neutrality ” favors the side with the biggest arsenal . “ Nonintervention ” is a form of interference . If you will the end—and President Barack Obama has finally said that Qaddafi should indeed go—then to that extent you will the means .
Libya is a country with barely 6 million inhabitants . By any computation , however cold and actuarial , the regime of its present dictator can not possibly last very much longer . As a matter of pure realism , the post-Qaddafi epoch is upon us whether we choose to welcome the fact or not . The immediate task is therefore to limit the amount of damage Qaddafi can do and sharply minimize the number of people they can murder . Whatever the character of the successor system turns out to be , it can hardly be worsened if we show it positive signs of friendship and solidarity . But the pilots of Qaddafi 's own air force , who flew their planes to Malta rather than let themselves be used against civilians , have demonstrated more courage and principle than the entire U.S. Sixth Fleet .
There 's another consequence to our continuing passivity . I am sure I am not alone in feeling rather queasy about being forced to watch the fires in Tripoli and Benghazi as if I were an impotent spectator . Indifference of this kind to the lives of others can have a coarsening effect . It can lower one 's threshold of sympathy . If protracted unduly , it might even become brutalizing .
Los Angeles Galaxy striker Landon Donovan looks set for a return to the Premier League next month through a short-term loan deal – but they could be persuaded to join Fulham instead of Everton , it has emerged .
LA Galaxy forward Landon Donovan could be back in the Premier League next month ( Getty )
The American international spent two-and-a-half months at Goodison Park last season , scoring twice in an impressive 13-game spell between January and early March .
Speculation has been rife that Donovan , 28 , will return to England again for a loan spell that coincides with the close season in the MLS .
However , recent rumours that Everton will take them back have been replaced by talk that goal-shy Fulham – who have drawn ten of their 17 league games so far in the current campaign – will also make a bid .
Cottagers manager Mark Hughes said after Saturday 's goalless home draw with Sunderland that they would be targetting a forward in January .

They said : ‘ We are missing a Bobby Zamora type and they will not be back until the end of January or start of February if everything goes to plan .
‘ So if there 's someone we can bring in to help us , we will look at it .
‘ But more often than not strikers cost a lot of money at Premier League level , so we will have to see . '
While Donovan does not represent a traditional target man , they showed at the World Cup with crucial strikes against Slovenia , Algeria and Ghana that they are capable of providing a cutting edge – something Fulham have lacked this season .
The presence of American international team-mate Clint Dempsey at Craven Cottage may also provide a draw for Donovan .
However , Moyes has hinted they wo n't give up on the forward without a fight .
‘ We know we need a striker , ' they said .
‘ But the sort of money it will cost… it is probably a reality that we will have to look at bringing in a loan player , that it will be the loan market we will need to look at to provide some sort of solution . '

The Amber Alert issued overnight for a nine-year-old boy believed to have been abducted in the Niagara Region of southern Ontario has been lifted .
The alert was cancelled at 11 a.m. Thursday morning , based on information received by Niagara Police .
The boy was believed to have been abducted by their mother and their uncle .
Niagara Regional Police Const . Derek Watson told CP24 the boy was found with their mother at a hotel in downtown Toronto . Their uncle was arrested separately , police said .
Earlier Thursday , CTV News learned a grey Mazda sought in connection with the disappearance was stopped in the area of Martin Grove Road and Rexdale Boulevard in Toronto 's west end .
Police said the boy and their father are U.S. citizens who live in Georgia . They were in Niagara Falls for a family visit to Marineland .
Watson said the father and the boy 's biological mother are estranged and it 's believed the two had not seen each other for quite some time .
“ There is no relationship between the child and the mother , ” Watson earlier told The Canadian Press . “ I do n't think they 've had any contact for over four years . Through our investigation , there 's no doubt this was planned . ”
Britain 's ambassador to the US has attempted to mend fences with Donald Trump after the President-elect backed Nigel Farage for the job .
Sir Kim Darroch has praised Mr Trump 's `` historic and impressive win '' , just weeks after dismissing them as `` an outsider and an unknown quantity '' .
They have even suggested the relationship between Mr Trump and Theresa May could be as strong as that of Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher .
The ambassador 's original comment , in a leaked memo to the Prime Minister written on the day after the US election , prompted Mr Trump to champion Mr Farage to replace Sir Kim .

`` Many people would like to see @ Nigel_Farage represent Great Britain as their Ambassador to the United States , '' Mr Trump tweeted . `` He would do a great job ! ''
Despite a public campaign for the job by the former UKIP leader , including three visits to New York to see Mr Trump , Downing Street has insisted there is no vacancy .
In an interview with Adam Boulton on Sky News after Mr Trump 's tweet , Mr Farage rounded on the Government for rejecting suggestions they could help cement US/UK relations .
And they called for Sir Kim to resign as ambassador because they are a `` fanatical Europhile and part of the old regime '' whose views would be `` diametrically opposed to Trump 's '' .
Farage on Trump , trade and their version of the 'real world '
Now , in an article for the Washington Post newspaper , Sir Kim has adopted a more flattering tone towards the President-elect and said America and Britain must move forward together .
They wrote : `` 2016 has been a seismic year for both American and British politics . Donald Trump has captured the presidency in a historic and impressive win like no other in history .
`` Brexit and the election of President-elect Trump captured the mood and will of the electorate . Now is the time move forward together and embrace the opportunities ahead .
`` In their phone calls so far , Trump and British Prime Minister Theresa May have made clear that the special relationship between Britain and the United States is stronger than ever .
`` They will work together closely , building on the legacy of previous leaders such as President Reagan and Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher . ''
PM rejects Trump 's call for Farage as ambassador
In their 9 November memo , leaked to The Sunday Times , Sir Kim told Mrs May that `` Trump did the apparently impossible '' in winning the White House .
And they said : `` It bears repeating that this soon to be President-elect is above all an outsider and an unknown quantity , whose campaign pronouncements may reveal their instincts , but will surely evolve and , particularly , be open to outside influence if pitched right . ''
Now , in their Washington Post article , they continued : `` The United States and Britain will continue to work ever more closely to provide security to each other . As partners who share intelligence and technology , we do more together than any other two countries in the world . ''
They added : `` As we look ahead , it 's worth recalling the words quoted by both Reagan and Thatcher : 'You can not strengthen the weak by weakening the strong . ' For decades , our partnership has been the cornerstone of the world order . So we , as an alliance , will continue to be strong . ''
Reed Doughty Bids Farewell to the Redskins
Veteran safety Reed Doughty has been a Redskins player since they were drafted in 2006 , the pick used in the 6th round ( 173rd overall ) to draft Doughty was traded to Washington by the NY Jets , for Redskins quarterback Patrick Ramsey .
Doughty was never a “ game changer ” but in fact was a good fill-in at strong safety and was a dependable special teams player for eight years . The Redskins have clearly moved in a different direction as it pertains to Reed Doughty 's playing position and a quick look at the post they made on Instagram will tell you reality has set in .
Last week in the ‪ # ‎DMV‬ . Headed to CO when the kids get out of school . Been a good 8 yr run with the @ redskins . Want to thank the Redskins organization , especially HOF coach Joe Gibbs . They valued character , hardwork and special teams . They believed in me enough to take a chance on me and draft me . Thanks to my family , friends , coaches , teammates , fans , trainers , equipment managers , and all the people inside the redskins building who I have interacted with for 8 yrs . thanks to the people at @ VSI_spinemd and @ thevtfc for getting me healthy after I thought my career was over prematurely . Most of all I am thankful for the relationships I have built over the last 8 yrs . thanks to my church @ cfcwired and our small group bible study . This group has encouraged me and my family , prayed for us , and have become lifelong friends . God never ceases to amaze me . I pray that my life will be a living testimony of their faithfulness , mercy , grace and love . Whether I continue on my NFL journey or transition into a new career , I am thankful . I have my best friend , my wife Katie Deters Doughty , to share life with and raise our boys together . God Bless !
Doughty spent eight seasons as a Redskin and played in 107 games , starting 54 . They added 336 tackles with 170 assisted tackles , 3.5 sacks and 3 interceptions .

digital mode for making payments +
NEW DELHI : In a bid to promote electronic transactions , NITI Aayog has asked NPCI to frame an award scheme to incentivise people usingthrough weekly and quarterly lucky draws.NITI Aayog has requested National Payments Corporation of India to conceptualise and launch a new scheme to incentivise digital payments . NPCI is a not for profit company which is charged with a responsibility of guiding India towards being a cashless society.According to a NITI Aayog statement , there has been a remarkable increase in both volume and amount of digital payment transactions since November 9 , when government demonetised high value notes of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000.It is necessary to ensure that electronic payments are adopted by all sections of the society , it said . `` We need to encourage electronic payments and nudge the society to move from digital to digi-dhan , '' NITI Aayog said.Under the proposal all consumers and merchants using digital payments shall be eligible.There will be two levels of incentive amounts available under the scheme . First , weekly lucky draw of the transaction IDs generated in that week . The contours of which are being finalised , it said.NITI Aayog has also proposed quarterly draw for grand prizes and asked NPCI that while designing the scheme the focus will be on poor , lower middle class and small businesses.All modes of digital payments - USSD , AEPS , UPI and RuPay Cards - will be eligible under the scheme . For merchants , transactions made on the POS machines installed at their locations would be considered , it saidNITI Aayog said that the detailed guideline of the scheme shall be unveiled soon . However , it would be ensured that all those who have used digital payment systems after November 8 shall be eligible to participate in the scheme.The scheme would also provide for recognition of state governments , their undertakings , districts and urban & rural local bodies who innovate for promoting electronic payment in their respective jurisdictions .
Bushiroad released this ( re- ) introduction to Shizuku Osaka ! ( To be honest , I do n't remember much about them from SIF , since I was n't paying attention during their stories… gomen ne , Shizuku-chan ; A ; ) Let me know if there are any errors ! If you 're viewing this on mobile , Tumblr might make the image sizes weird .
Similar to the others , this is an SIF-style dialogue , with Shizuku addressing the reader—an older student—before recording their self-introduction video , the text of which was released earlier in the PDP member profiles .
Introduction
Today , we have a dialogue with Shizuku Osaka-chan—who just transferred to Nijigasaki High School—right before recording their self-introduction video . Will we get a peek at an unexpected side of the earnest and diligent school idol Shizuku-chan… ? !
Dialogue
Good afternoon . Looking forward to working with you today !
Huh ? You 're wondering if my theater club activities are fine ? Yes , of course . Today 's a free day , so after we finish shooting this video , it 'll just be independent practice .
N-no , I 'm not really that great . It 's just that I enjoy acting .
Besides , I think you 're more impressive than I am . After all , have n't you spent a lot of time studying not only school idols , but myself as well ?
Yup , I know . You 've been to a lot of our theater club 's performances , right ? I could n't forget your eyes shining as you were watching us .
Because I saw that you took me so seriously , and because that came through when you were trying your best to recruit me , I decided to work harder than ever at being a school idol .
Together with you , I want to strive to reach the stages you dream of . Acting and being a school idol : they certainly have their differences , but they 're alike in that we want to make the audience smile and enjoy themselves . I 'll absolutely be trying my best , so I 'm looking forward to your guidance .
Hm ? The classroom next to us is a little noisy , right ? If we start filming like this , the noise is going to end up in the video… Ah , please continue setting up . I 'll be back after talking to them .
[ Pause . ]
Sorry to keep you waiting . There was an older student I did n't know , so it was a little scary , but I managed to talk to them , and it seems like they got the message .
Actually , it kind of felt like they were also a little scared of me , but I 'm probably imagining things , right ? Anyway , let 's start on the video !
Bonus : I poked around and found an expression that did n't end up in the dialogue . I guess they made it and decided not to use it .
Manchester City are ready to pay the €50m ( £39m ) release clause to sign the French defender Aymeric Laporte from Athletic Bilbao as Pep Guardiola steps up their recruitment drive for next season .
City confirmed the signing of the Germany midfielder Ilkay Gündogan from Borussia Dortmund on Thursday for around £20m but with concerns over the long-term fitness of captain Vincent Kompany , central defence is seen as a major priority . As revealed by the Guardian in April , Laporte has been identified as Guardiola 's preferred target despite the defender being ruled out until August with a broken leg and dislocated ankle .

City are understood to be preparing a contract offer for Laporte and their agents – former Spain internationals Carles Puyol and Iván de la Peña – before submitting their bid to Athletic .
Having turned 22 last week , Laporte has been a regular for the Basque club since 2013 and has now played more than 120 games in La Liga . They are also predominantly left footed – a trait that is believed to have been made a priority by Guardiola and the sporting director , Txiki Begiristain .
Laporte , who moved to Athletic as a 16-year-old , has signed four contract extensions since December 2013 as their status as one of the world 's best young defenders has grown .
Their potential signing would take the club 's spending on central defenders over the last two years to almost £110m , having spent £42m on Eliaquim Mangala in 2014 and £28.5m on Nicolás Otamendi last summer . City also already have the highly rated Belgium defender Jason Denayer on their books , who is expected to be given a chance to prove themselves in the first team squad after spending the last two seasons out on loan .
City are also understood to be interested in signing 16-year-old striker Abel Ruiz from Barcelona after their impressive performances in the Under 17 European Championship last month , when Spain were beaten in the final by Portugal . Ruiz , who has also been tracked by Arsenal in the past , is believed to be open to the move having not signed a contract which was offered to them in March .

What will happen to Saudis and Kuwaitis when they run out of oil ? An Arabic hashtag expressing that fear has now been used a million times .
Early last week , an Arabic hashtag that translates to 'Your job after oil runs out ... ' begun to trend mostly in Saudi Arabia but also in neighbouring Kuwait . Citizens of these countries used it to make jokes , but there was also serious contemplation of a future without their once abundant oil wealth . Some Saudis contemplated returning to a simpler lifestyle and perhaps becoming shepherds . Others were a bit more pessimistic about their nation 's future . `` I 'm unemployed and there are another million like me , so how much worse will it get when oil runs out ? '' one man commented on Twitter . Despite being the largest oil producer in the region , Saudi Arabia has had a longstanding issue with unemployment .
Saudis are feeling insecure because oil prices recently hit a four-year low . That does n't in itself tell us anything about oil supply - indeed if it was running out the price might be expected to rise - but in 2011 a Citigroup report warned that Saudi might run out of oil to export by 2030 . Inside the country , many believe that the kingdom is not ready for a future without oil . One Saudi tweeted : `` I fear we will say we wasted our oil in luxury and opulence and did n't make use of it in scientific advances that will benefit us and the coming generations . ''
The International Monetary Fund has recently urged the Saudi government to spend less and use its money better for a time when oil runs out . Over the last few years , Saudi has spent more on welfare and is now embarking on large infrastructure projects . But some of the comments online were critical of government 's 'generosity ' in foreign aid . `` I would take back the financial aid we handed to countries left and right ... we have more right to that money , '' one of the few female Saudis who commented said .
Despite its oil reserves , ordinary people in Saudi have expressed anxiety over the economy in the recent past . Back in July , people used the hashtag `` the salary does not meet my needs '' and discussed the financial struggles some people face even in one of the world 's wealthiest nations . The fear of a post-oil era extended to neighbouring Kuwait , albeit amongst a much smaller population . Kuwaitis also became active using the hashtag to express similar concerns on social media . One Kuwaiti commented `` I pray to God not to see that day because this generation ca n't be self-sufficient '' .

The Marlins have agreed to sign corner infielder Chris Johnson , Barry Jackson of the Miami Herald reports on Twitter . They were recently cut loose by the Indians after spending the last few months of 2015 in Cleveland following a trade from the Braves .
Johnson could provide a complement to left-handed-hitting first baseman Justin Bour , Jackson suggests . He 's spent most of their career at third base , of course , and would boost the team 's depth there as well , though starter Martin Prado and utility option Derek Dietrich are already in place .
The 31-year-old Johnson owns a .280/.316/.411 slash in their seven big league seasons . He 's a good line-drive hitter who makes plenty of contact , but the lack of power and mediocre fielding reviews have held down their value .
While it has n't yet been reported whether Johnson will receive a major league deal , most of Johnson 's salary ( $ 7.5MM this year , and $ 9MM next ) will be covered by Cleveland regardless . Much like Edwin Jackson , who also agreed with the Fish recently , Miami will get a more or less free roll opportunity on a veteran looking for a chance to re-establish themselves as a viable Major League contributor .
In this East Coast vs. West Coast battle , it looks like the West Coast is winning .
According to a review of data from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis , Bloomberg found that the tech boom is shifting the richest cities in America to the West Coast . Three out of the top five land here with San Jose topping the charts .
Bridgeport , Conn. , an ultra-wealthy suburb outside New York City where many in finance live , comes in No . 2 , but San Francisco and Seattle follow , with Boston rounding out the top five .
Bloomberg looked at the nation 's 100 largest metro areas to crunch the numbers to see which city had the “ highest output per resident ” in 2014 .
Apparently , tech is the new gold rush , with the gross metropolitan product , or GMP per capita in Silicon Valley at $ 105,482 — which Bloomberg cites is “ more than double the national average . ”
Seattle 's GMP came in at $ 75,874 , but our neighbor to the south , Portland , is also seeing a large jump .
See the map of U.S. cities below :
“ Tech cities outside the Bay Area have also benefited from the industry 's boom . Helped by not only Amazon Inc. but also newer Internet companies like Zulily Inc. , Seattle 's GMP per capita grew by a cumulative 7.9 percent since 2009 , when the economic recovery began , ” Bloomberg noted .
“ That helped the Washington city catapult to No . 4 from its No . 6 spot in 2008 through 2011 , ” the report continues . “ Biotech hotbed Boston also jumped two places since 2008 , while Portland , Oregon ( sometimes called Silicon Forest ) climbed six spots . ”
The Bloomberg report also states that these areas have “ some of the densest concentrations of educated workers , ” which helps drive GMP .
Of course , like yin and yang , here 's the bad news that comes with the good — “ These emerging tech hubs will probably expand even more in coming years…Sky-high rents in northern California force workers and businesses to look elsewhere . ”
Look forward to more traffic , and rising housing and commercial real estate costs to go along with that boom .
Councilman promises solution for frustrated residents along crash-prone stretch of Windward Oahu road Copyright by KHON - All rights reserved Video
Calls for action on a dangerous road in Kailua are finally being heard .
On Friday , we told you about a stretch of Keolu Drive where residents say there have been multiple accidents over the years .
That same day -- a truck plowed into parked car , and an HPD speed monitoring trailer that was put there for the very purpose of getting people to slow down .
Residents told us something needs to change before someone is seriously injured .
A truck was left badly damaged and an HPD speed trailer was put out of commission after an accident on this portion of Keolu Drive on Friday . It 's a part of the road where a straightaway leads to a slight curve , and Jasmine Abbey , who lives on the street , told us this kind of thing is n't out of the ordinary . `` Personally we have only lived here a year . So personally we have had our car hit . Our neighbors have had their car hit . Almost everyone in I would say a three house vicinity has had their car hit at least one time . ''
The area council member , Ikaika Anderson , says he 's aware of residents concerns , and has been reaching out to city officials to try and come up with a solution , as far back as last December .
Until recently , had n't heard back . `` For whatever reason the administration did n't get back to us for a number of months . The administration admitted they are not getting back to us . They have apologized for it , and upon my return to Honolulu this week from visiting my daughter in school I will be meeting with the administration . I already have a meeting date set for this week . ''
In a statement Monday the city confirmed there is a meeting set up for later this week to discuss possible options for this section of Keolu Drive , and acknowledged it found three major traffic incidents in the area since 2014 .
Jeff Sulzbach , who lives on the street says this week 's meeting will be a step in the right direction . `` I think we really appreciate that there has been some action over the last week and the correspondence both for the police department and the mayors office we 've been very appreciative . We 'd like to see the momentum continue we hope they will continue to work on solving a problem and work on finding a solution . ''
Anderson says he 's aware of residents frustrations , `` I have seen how frustrated these residents are and again I certainly understand . If I have n't heard back within the last eight or nine months as their elected official I can only imagine the frustration that they 're feeling . ''
I 'm not sure to be honest . Of course , most people can only evaluate the stereotype , because you only know how the people are if you live there , but there is still truth in it . For instance , what socionics.us sees as the `` dominating '' IE in the ethnosocionics section is Ti . I think this is a good choice . I guess I 'm not even perceive it in the same way as a stranger would , but the people take rules and laws extremely serious and literal . The bureaucracy has much influence and everything is so comlicated if you want to get something done . There are rules for everything because people seem to believe everything turns into chaos if it 's not specified which kind of shingles you 're allowed to put on your roof.Some people might have a good social conscience , but this is still a society which is based on performance . You work to be richer , have a fat car and an own house with garden . German TV often shows low-income and socially weak people for entertainment reasons . The rich are admired ( mostly the self-made of course ) and money is an integral part of life . ( Maybe I 'm stating the obvious , meaning it 's the same in almost every country . Maybe , I do n't know ) The Ineffable said they know someone who seems to have a Finland-fetish of some sort . Coincidentally , Finland got Si in the same ethnosocionic article I linked above . Germans have that stereotype of the relaxed northern european people who just enjoy life and do n't care too much about achievements in a material sense . I 'm not suprised that many people in the country ca n't identify with that constant striving for more . More exports , more economic growth , more of everything . Take a look in the news , that 's what it 's all about . That 's why I think many Germans either live a life focused on their careers ( including family , the kids have to go to the best schools ect . ) and have a hard time to relax and other `` unproductive '' things or , if they do n't qualify , settle for constant partying and rather superficial pleasures.But it 's all a little difficult as so many different people are compressed in so little space .
A man is under arrest after calling the Clearwater Police Department , non-stop . In a matter of hours , police say Michael Mott rang their Communications Center 98 times .
The reason ? They said the police have their money and they want it back .
Here are how some of the calls went :
CPD : Hello ? Hello ?
Mott : Who is this ?
CPD : Clearwater Police Department
Mott : Who is this ?
CPD : Nikki .
Mott : Nikki what ?
CPD : Sir , can I help you ? Do you need the police ?
Mott : No . I need my money . But y'all hold onto it .
They hung up . Then , they called again and again , saying things like , `` Y'all give my money back , '' and , `` Y'all ( expletive ) better give me my money . '' They refused to give their name or their location .
DETROIT ROBBER SENDS SEMI-NUDE PHOTO OF VICTIM TO Them PHONE CONTACTS
In a matter of six hours , Mott allegedly rang 98 different times . Still , each and every one had to be answered .
`` They were frequently tied up with nonsense which is not a good thing , '' said Rob Shaw , CPD public information officer .
`` You never know , that one time they did call , there actually may have been an emergency , '' said Tracy Squitieri , police communications manager . `` We have to treat every call as if it is an emergency until we know otherwise . ''
The money Mott was referring to had to do with a January drug arrest where police say they sold drugs to officers . During the series of calls , they went so far as to call the chief 's office , berating the person who picked up . Police were eventually able to locate and arrest him .
`` He used at least two phones for the calls and I 'm told by one of our officers that they even made a couple of the calls in the presence of one of our officers , even after we showed up and confronted them about the misuse of the system , '' said Shaw .

Paulinho is now one more player in the Barcelona dressing room and they say they have been `` received really well . '' The Brazilian , in an interview with SPORT , came across as really ambitious as they get started at Camp Nou , saying he 's ready `` to work really hard to achieve the objectives I 've set out '' which start with `` winning , we ca n't think anything other than winning titles . ''
For that , Paulinho has two short-term challenges : to convine Ernesto Valverde that they should be a regular and , also , to convince those who have doubted their arrival . Personally , they have no doubts . `` With respect to all the players here , I come with the idea of being a starter . I respected everyone a lot , by my thoughts are on playing and starting , '' they expalined in the interview , which took place on Wednesday at the Ciutat Esportiva Joan Gamper .
They will not be team-mates with their compatriot Neymar , although they say `` that is part of football . [ Neymar ] took the decision to leave and , even though he 's an excellent player and would help a lot , he 's gone . That 's football . But we have a strong group of players with a lot of quality . That 's now in the past and we have to look to the future . '' They will have Leo Messi by their side , though , and he 's already training with the Argentine : `` He 's the best in the world , with unexplainable quality . I 'm focusing on the way you have to play [ at Barça ] , on how I have to play to adapt to [ Messi ] . Because the objective is to do everything possible to make them the best player in the world again and that will help us win titles . ''

JULY 15TH , 12:58pm : The Kings have officially signed Landry , the team announced today in a press release .
JULY 6TH , 3:35pm : The value of Landry 's deal has yet to be finalized , but it will be between $ 26MM and $ 27MM , and it will likely include a player option as well , tweets Shams Charania of RealGM.com .
3:23pm : Carl Landry will sign with the Kings , agent Mark Bartelstein tells TNT 's David Aldridge ( Twitter link ) . The power forward will get a four-year , $ 26MM package , tweets Adrian Wojnarowski of Yahoo ! Sports . The 29-year-old had been in serious talks with the Clippers , but it appears they were outbid , as Marc Stein notes on Twitter , pegging the value of Landry 's deal at $ 27MM . Either way , the Clippers were limited to their mid-level exception , and the Kings were willing to surpass that .
Landry spent last season with the Warriors , but declined their $ 4MM player option . They said their first priority was to re-sign with Golden State , and even though the W 's recent moves appear to have enabled the team to have the flexibility to re-sign them and Jarrett Jack , the prospect of a tidy raise appears to have been too tempting for Landry .
The Blazers and Bucks appeared to be in the mix as well , and Landry expected a half dozen teams to pursue him . The former second-round pick averaged 10.8 points and a career-high 6.0 rebounds this past season , but their value has shown up better in advanced metrics , as their career PER is 17.7 , well above average .
The Kings had been angling for more expensive targets this summer , but withdrew their four-year , $ 56MM offer to Andre Iguodala , and gave up on retaining Tyreke Evans , sending the restricted free agent out in a sign-and-trade that netted Greivis Vasquez . The team could use the money it 's saved on another complementary piece to go along with Landry .
We are learning more about the teenager who allegedly opened fire at a South Carolina elementary school , injuring two young students and one teacher .
A family friend of the accused gunman said the 14-year-old was homeschooled after being suspended for bringing a weapon to school within the past two years . They are now in police custody .
Classes are canceled at Townville Elementary , where the gunman opened fire at about 1:45 p.m. , after they shot and killed their father at home , police said . The school of nearly 300 students had practiced such a scenario multiple times over the past several years , and officials said those active shooter drills helped prevent the unthinkable from becoming a lot worse , reports CBS News correspondent Manuel Bojorquez .
Police : Teen shoots 3 at S.C. elementary school
Dozens of law enforcement officers began swarming Townville Elementary School , seven minutes after receiving a call from a teacher that there was a gunman on campus .
“ The shooter is going to be a white male , all black clothing , and blonde hair , ” said a 911 dispatcher .
Two six-year-old students were shot – one in the leg and the other in the foot -- and a female teacher was also struck in the shoulder . The teacher and one student were released from the hospital Wednesday night . The other child , Jacob Hall – who was airlifted to the hospital -- remains in the hospital in critical condition .
Investigators said there is no known relationship between the victims and the suspected shooter .
“ The shooter is a juvenile , he 's a white male . There 's no racial undertones there . There 's no terrorism involved , ” said Anderson County Sheriff Deputy Chief Keith Smith .
Police say the shooter , who was armed with a handgun , never entered the school . Volunteer firefighter Jamie Brock apprehended them and held them outside on the playground until police arrived .
“ And as you all have heard , one of our firefighters did that . And probably save a lot more lives , ” said Anderson County Sheriff John Skipper Jr. , getting emotional .
Police say the gunman began their rampage by shooting their father – 47-year-old Jeffrey Osborne – at the family 's home . At about 1:44 p.m. , the shooter called their grandmother and was emotional .
When the grandparents visited the home , they discovered their son 's body and their grandson gone . They had already driven to Townville Elementary about three miles away .
Frantic parents were alerted by text to come to the school as students were evacuated to a nearby church . Scott Nadolny rushed to meet their daughter , Lacey .
“ I saw them come out . And I just ran to her…crying , ” Nadolny said . “ And just gave them a big hug . You know , just thankful . ”
„ My most beautiful memories about the game are about my then-girlfriend and my cousin , as they were as crazy about Anno as I was . We turned on our notebooks , sat down on a round table in front of the chimney and played until the middle of the night . Anno was a companion on my lifes journey. ” – Striffelbaer
Many of us keep many precious memories , as they were part of our gaming lifes for so many years and the reason for that much-cited special Anno feeling . These moments show us that across the many years and titles in the series , a great and unique gaming community was always part of our journey . Eleven years ago , Anno 1701 had its maiden voyage- full speed ahead into the third dimension to bring us new visuals and features to allow us to immerse ourselves in the world of Anno like never before . We would like to raise our hat to Anno 1701 and its community , and therefore this week 's content will be dedicated to the first Anno in 3D !
Anno 1701 was an important leap for the series as a whole , as the third Anno introduced new features and systems and with that , set the direction for future titles . We would like to highlight the special memories from our community today and the upcoming Devblog will explore our own memories as Anno developers and why Anno 1701 's heritage is still of importance to the upcoming Anno 1800 .
Did you know that Anno 1701 had two board game tie-ins and even a book ? Maybe some of you even own one of these precious pieces ? We are interested what objects you might have in your collection and if you are a fan of the idea of expanding the Anno universe with board games or other merchandise !

Fan Creations
We asked for your best Anno 1701 memories and creations and community member and artist Anno90 answered that call . We are happy to present a true Anno Union masterpiece :
Last but not least , we would like to share a few of those very special Anno 1701 Union memories , funny throwbacks and even touching stories :
Soulridder
I guess Anno 1701 was my first Anno ever . Back then , I played it on a Nintendo DS , because I did not own a PC at that time . ^^ The most satisfying experience was build your city on a volcanic island and later take someone 's island for your own just to expand it even more . Not quite that easy with a negative income where my only income came from raiding other AI players , but it made fun to rebuild the island and expand it once it was taken , especially because I could n't build much and once I took some island completely . I also played games where I just build up my city without raids , but a volcanic island was a must-have for me and still is in all Anno games where a volcano exists like in 1404 .
Marc_The_Miner
I was born 2004 , so I am fairly young . My first Anno game was 1404 and I was so excited about the game that I wanted to get the more Anno titles and I ended up playing 1701 . Despite being an older game , I really liked the visuals and had a great time playing . The best thing about 1701 is that you can declare your independence from the Queen and that you can attack other civilizations . That leads to more gameplay freedom as nobody tells me what or how to do it !
NK3D
My most beautiful memory is an also a very personal and special moment for me . As a small boy , I desperately wanted to play Anno 1701 , especially after playing 1602 and 1503 . I just wanted to experience the look and feel of the new title . One day , quite some time after the release of 1701 had passed , ; my mom came home and brought a gift for me . It was Anno 1701 – The Sunken Dragon . They told me that it was a great bargain ( single mother and we had not much money ) but we both had no clue that it was an expansion and I was happy until I realized that I could not play it… . I was sad and my mom did not understand why until they did some research and understood that it was not the full game . They promised that , with my next birthday or Easter celebration , I would get Anno 1701 as a gift . And indeed , that is what happened ! It was an amazing moment and we both were incredibly happy about the outcome . I spent some many hours playing Anno 1701 and I still play it today . It holds a wonderful emotional memory for me and it still holds up greatly . Thank you for bringing this kind of moment with the anniversary content back !

Anno 1701 * dreams * , just wonderful times < 3
I can remember how sceptical I was at first . An Anno in 3D , can I even play that ? I had problems with my eyes back then , especially with everything in 3D . And then , I had the pleasure to get invited to test the game at Related Designs in Mainz . It was brilliant ; I just hopped on my bike and drove to the studio . It was a great day , being able to play the game for one day , while the developers watch you and ask you plenty of questions . Oh and then there was the fan meet and greet on Castle Ronneburg . We slept in a B & B and there was a special surprise event in Büdingen . There was an actor outfit doing a nightly tour through in historic garbs re-enacting old stories from the city Büdingen .
After that , we had a meet & greet in the actual castle . We started with a tour , had a lesson on a bow shooting range and a medieval dinner with a herald being responsible for the distraction . I have the fondest memories of that event but I can tell you that it was a lot of work to organize everything . It was great to hear that the son of the chef of the restaurant was a big Anno fan . I just invited both to join our festive party and I made sure that they even got some Anno goodies . Everyone was just delighted . We had plenty of sponsored goodies for everyone , including a real fisherman 's pipe ! What a brilliant community , just wonderful .

`` There Will Only Be One '' - an Interview With Viabtc Founder Yang Haipo
Back in August , Viabtc founder Yang Haipo was one of the first public figures to declare ” Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin ” . Their exchange Viabtc was one of the first to list bitcoin cash ( BCH ) , which was heavily criticized by Chinese industrial players for being “ controlled ” by Bitmain . Now Haipo is planning their new business Coinex , a crypto-crypto exchange that only pairs digital assets against BCH . In an interview with news.Bitcoin.com , Yang Haipo ( Yang ) shared their thoughts about the initial fork offering ( IFO ) craze .

The IFOs Craze
Bitcoin.com ( BC ) : If you think BCH is bitcoin , do you think other forked coins are also bitcoin ?
Yang : In a broad sense , they are because they forked from the original BTC chain . But in a narrow sense , Satoshi 's whitepaper defined that bitcoin is a peer to peer electronic cash system . And clearly , only BCH is in line with the vision of Satoshi . It is the real bitcoin .
BC : You mean the whitepaper is the sole criterion ?
Yang : Exactly . Satoshi created bitcoin to develop it into a form of money , a widely used payment system , even a global currency . The current version of BTC is only a store of value . Its price increases because of additional investment from new participants . Is n't it basically a Ponzi scheme ?
BCH , however , is a totally different story . A lot of people dub BCH “ Jihan coin ” or “ China coin ” , but this is not true . BCH was not created overnight . It came out with the joint efforts of big blockers , miners , exchanges and wallet services . It set an example that a forked coin could survive , and that 's why some individuals and teams followed suit and forked bitcoin .
BC : One of the biggest advantages of bitcoin is its store of value brought about in part by its scarcity . But now we have more coins with a 21 million limits , more bearing the name of bitcoin . Do you think this is inflation in disguise ? Is bitcoin still immune to inflation ?
Yang : I do n't think this is inflation . Just like our species is the only human variation after our closest relatives died out , there will only be one bitcoin that can dominate the global payment system . The cryptocurrency industry is still in its early stage with bitcoin , and altcoins competing for market share . But only one coin will end up with the largest market cap or the highest price . It will be called bitcoin , and its maximum distribution will still be 21 million .
BC : Coinex , your new exchange , is to open at the end of this month . Will it list all forked coins and distribute them to users ? Or is there a standard , for example , of not listing pre-mined coins ?
Yang : Coinex will list mainstream cryptocurrencies like BTC , ETH , BCH , LTC , ZEC , DASH . I personally welcome people to fork bitcoin and work on different roadmaps . But we do n't support unethical and meaningless coins like Bitcoin Gold ( BTG ) and Bitcoin God ( GOD ) .
BCH VS LTC
BC : Proponents of BCH want it to be used as a payment system , but LTC has long been recognized as the coin for small payments . It has low fees and fast confirmations . Do you think BCH can compete with LTC as an alternative payment solution ?
Yang : BCH has two advantages , larger user base and an open scalability . Firstly , BCH has the same user base as BTC . If you check at reddit and bitcoin talk , you will find that BCH supporters are more active than that of LTC . These supporters will urge more exchanges and wallet services to support BCH , and make it the most successful coin .
Secondly , BCH is more scalable . LTC has the same scalability problem as BTC , and if bitcoin wants to evolve into a global currency , it will have to increase its block size to 100 megabyte ( MB ) or even 1 gigabyte ( GB ) . At present , only BCH is able to move toward an adaptive block size limit .
BC : LTC 's roadmap gives priority to the lightning network and atomic swap . The BCH community seems to not have a united roadmap . There were rumors about RSK being included in BCH , but nothing official ever came about . What do you think should be the development roadmap for BCH ?
Yang : The BCH community is very clear about its roadmap , scale to make bitcoin a great form of money . The technical feature , lightning network , sounds fancy , but it is actually just old wine in a new bottle . Users need to save their assets to a service provider of a lightning network node . Is n't it exactly like what we have now , saving money at banks ? What 's disruptive about it ? Bitcoin is a great invention that allows everybody to be their own bank . BCH will make sure users can transfer coins with low fees on the BCH chain and be their own bank .
BC : Do you believe , as some big blockers do , that Core developers work on offchain transactions to maximize the economic interests of Blocksteam？
Yang : There are no hard facts to support such a conspiracy theory . But unless Core developers leave Blockstream and do n't receive their funds , these types of conspiracy theories will remain about Core .
BC : Litecoin creator Charlie Lee had been emphasizing they want to focus on development , not marketing . But last week they tweeted that LTC would start working on promotion . Do you think the BCH community has done enough marketing ? And it seems like BCH has a governance problem . It 's been four months , but BCH still does n't have a universal logo .
Yang : It 's funny that Charlie just wants to focus on development , but all they do is marketing . I believe marketing is a must for all businesses . Each and every coin is a brand . The brand name can generate more value if more people know about it . The establishment of the Bitcoin Cash Fund ( BCF ) will make the marketing and promotion part more efficient and organized . And I do n't think BCH has a governance problem just because it does n't have a universal logo . LTC was created by Charlie Lee , so Charlie has the final say on its logo . But BCH was not created by a particular individual or a company . It represents a decentralized community where users , designers and exchanges have their own understanding on BCH . Some want its logo to be gold , some want it to be green . They need to argue for a while before a decision is made .
BCH VS BTC
BC : BCH supporters have been back and forth about the brand of bitcoin . You were the first to declare that BCH is bitcoin in the Chinese community . Later Jihan Wu tweeted that “ America is not England , Bitcoin Cash is not Bitcoin. ” This October , Roger ver and Jiang Zhuoer said only the big block coin BCH is the real bitcoin as well . But this Tuesday Jihan Wu posted on Weibo that Core 's contribution and philosophy on the BTC chain should be recognized and supported . I want to know how you view the brand war between BCH and BTC .
Yang : The key to the brand war involves what is bitcoin ultimately . I suppose Jihan believes the BTC chain is defined by Core and Blockstream ; if they believe BTC is bitcoin , then let them focus on BTC . Me , Roger and Jiang Zhuoer , we believe only the big block coin is bitcoin . BCH and BTC represent two different roadmaps and philosophies . If Core took their words back and decided to scale , I would not support them because we already have BCH . But if they actually decide to scale , I believe they might succeed due to their influence .
BC : The media often equates bitcoin with speculation . It seems that BCH might also have this problem . I know some bitcoiners who ask me if I “ wan na make money ? ” They tell me to “ buy BCH . It has a monthly pump-and-dump. ” Why does BCH price fluctuate so wildly ?
Yang : About pump and dump , many bitcoiners think the bitcoin market is just like the stock market where big whales , bankers manipulate the market . In fact , no single person will be able to control such a huge market . And early adopters hate each other these days , and so they will not work to manipulate the market .
I can understand why people have such concerns , but they are not real . About price spikes , BCH price rises because it has gained great support from the community . Some bitcoiners posted on reddit saying they finally realized BCH is the real thing , and that it will have a brighter future . They exchanged all of their BTC for BCH . Besides , any little price rise will always draw the attention of speculators .
BC : If you think BTC development is centralized , do n't you think BCH mining is also centralized ?
Yang : Only three Core developers have the right to submit BTC code . In other words , three developers define what is bitcoin . This is centralization . However , the BCH project has Bitcoin ABC , Bitcoin Unlimited , Bitcoin XT and other development teams that are independent from any companies . As for mining centralization , industrial players tend to forget a simple fact : it 's not Bitmain that dominates the market , it 's their products themselves winning in the market . Bitmain leads in the miner business because it perfectly integrates manufacturing , supply chain , sales , shipping and after-sales services . In addition , China is home to the world 's largest bitcoin mining data centers for its cheap labour and low electricity fees , which makes it possible to start a miner business with a small investment . I expect to see more miner manufacturers in the coming months . Bitmain will not dominate the market in the near future .
BCH Priced Exchange Coinex
BC : The new exchange Coinex will use BCH as the base currency . Why give up BTC ?
Yang : We will have no competitive edge over our rivals if we start yet another BTC-priced exchange . So why not create an exchange that only pairs digital assets against BCH ? It 's both creating history and attracting BCH supporters . And I am very confident about the future of BCH . It 's really huge to be the world 's first BCH-priced exchange .
BC : When Viabtc listed BCH in August , many Chinese users said that Viabtc was “ controlled ” by Bitmain . Is the new exchange also “ controlled ” by Bitmain ?
Yang : Nobody controls us . Bitmain is just our business partner . We have the final say in decision making , not Bitmain . Since Bitmain invested in our entire company , it 's not strange they are also an investor in Coinex , one of the products of our company .
BC : After China 's ban on ICOs and exchanges , Huobi , Okex and other exchanges see themselves as overseas companies , though their employees work in mainland China . Is Coinex an overseas exchange ? What is the team doing to manage regulatory risks ?
Yang : Coinex will be an overseas exchange . It is registered in London . And we also have an office in Hong Kong . Our research and development team is still in Shenzhen , but we plan to move it abroad and make Coinex a 100 % overseas exchange .

Once a little girl was being babysat by their older , wiser , taller and wealthier brother . The brother and the sister decided they 'd like some chocolate chip cookies , and the brother proceeded to gather the ingredients and to mix them according to the accepted , traditional recipe given on a slip of paper found in the kitchen .
“ Can I help mix the dough ? ” asked the sister .
“ No , I 'm sorry , it does n't say here you can , ” they replied .
“ Oh . OK. Can I eat the cookies ? ”
“ Of course , you can eat all the cookies you 'd like , ” brother answered wisely .
“ But does it say I can eat all the cookies I 'd like ? ”
“ Well no , it does n't need to specify everything , and Father said you can eat cookies , right ? ”
“ Yes , I suppose they did . SO I shall eat until I am sick of eating cookies . ”
“ Excellent . ”
The next time big brother watched over little sister , they had grown taller , and thought perhaps mixing walnuts into the dough might be a delightful change from the now traditional chocolate chip cookie brother so often mixed up .
“ Can I mix the cookie dough , this time ? ”
“ Well , why not . You 've grown . Here are your instructions . ”
“ Must I follow all the instructions ? ” they asked , meekly .
“ Yes , we must follow all the instructions on the recipe , or the cookies may not turn out . ”
“ But what if I want to add walnuts ? Can I add walnuts ? Just one , and I 'll eat it myself ? ”
“ Of course not . It does n't say here to add walnuts . SO you must not . ”
“ Does it say I should not add walnuts ? ”
“ Well we ca n't expect the recipe to specify everything that can not be added , why , the list would be enormous indeed . Silly girl . ”
“ But I can mix how and when you instruct ? ”
“ Yes , that is your privilege , to turn the dough which I have provided , and of course to eat all the cookies you 'd like . ”
“ But not walnut ? ”
“ Not walnut . ”
The last time big brother watched over little sister , they were taller even than the boy , and had grown wiser and had seen their friends eating many different cookies , even some they had made themselves .
“ Brother , can I now mix the dough as I 'd like , without your supervision , even when you are not around , or do n't approve of my mixing and baking ? ”
“ WhaAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAaaaaaaat ? ? ? ? ? ? ? Father said no . You recall in the Garden of Eatin ' when Father gave me commands to not partake of that fruit on the salad bar , and you did partake ? And they banished us from the restaurant , because of your inquisitive eating ? ”
“ Well , you never told me not to eat that fruit . ”
“ That 's not the point . The point is , Father told me , and you went against it . Now I 'm telling you — ”
“ –this time ”
“ – this time , yes , that father has a rule that you can not mix the dough on your own , add to it what you 'd like , though you may mix as I instruct , and eat all you 'd like . What 's the problem ? You have all that I have to give . ”
“ I 'd like to mix cookies on my own , I suppose . ”
“ Why ? Are my cookies not good enough ? Is the recipe not good enough ? Is Father 's wise recipe book , and their instructions to me , not good enough for you ? ”
“ Geez . Umm , look , I 'd just like to make cookies without you watching over me , telling me what to do , when to do it , and so on . You can understand that , ca n't you ? ”
“ I can understand . But you are saying the way Father has established now needs some variation or alternative . Do you think you are wiser , smarter , better than God ? They made everything ! ”
“ No , no , I 'm not saying that . Only tell me this : Have ye inquired of Father whether they will now let me make cookies on my own ? ”

Peter Warren Singer is a strategist for New America and author of many books including `` Wired for Wa r : The Robotics Revolution and Conflict in the 21st Century '' and the upcoming `` Ghost Fleet : A Novel of the Next World War . '' They will be presenting at the joint New America and Arizona State University conference on The Future of War on Tuesday , February 24 . The opinions expressed in this commentary are his .
( CNN ) The rise of the robot on the modern battlefield has happened so fast , it is almost breathtaking -- that is , if you are not a robot yourself .
When the U.S. military invaded Iraq just over a decade ago , it only had a handful of unmanned systems , aka drones , in the air , and zero deployed into the ground forces . Today , its inventory in the air numbers well over 7,000 , ranging from the now famous Predator and Reaper to the Navy 's new MQ-8 Fire Scout , a helicopter drone that just completed a series of autonomous takeoffs and landing tests from the back of a guided-missile destroyer .
On the ground , the inventory numbers some 12,000 , ranging from iRobot 's PackBots , used to search for roadside bombs in Afghanistan , to the U.S. Marine Corps Warfighting Lab 's tests with Qinetiq 's Modular Advanced Armed Robotic System , a tracked robot that mounts cameras and a machine gun .
This revolution is by no means just an American one . At least 87 other countries have used military robotics of some sort , ranging from the UK to China , which has an especially fast-growing drone fleet , as shown off at its recent arms trade show .
A number of nonstate actors have added robots to their wares as well , including most recently both sides of the Syrian civil war , and ISIS . Both sides in the Ukraine conflict are also using them
These robots , though , are just the start . If this was 100 years ago , they would be the equivalent of the Bristol TB 8 , the first bomber plane , or the Mark I , the first tank used in battle . A host of changes awaits us . Their size , shape and form will move in wild and , for many , quite scary new directions .
A future Marine squad might not just have an armed robot on the ground -- the plan is that it will also have its own microdrone , such as the PD-100 Black Hornet . The size of a hummingbird , it weighs 18 grams , and will allow a Marine to safely peer around a corner or sneak up on a sniper waiting to ambush the squad from the window of a five-story building down the road . Or , overhead might be a Zephyr , a solar-powered drone with 74-foot wings , that could stay in the air for 11 days .
Perhaps the biggest change that looms , however , is in the robots ' intelligence and autonomy . The early Predator-class systems were `` unmanned '' only in that a human was n't inside them . On the ground , human operators had to remotely instruct their every function and move . The current versions are now more automated , able to do things like take off and land on their own , fly to various mission waypoints on their own , and carry sensors that make sense of what they are seeing for the humans .
This next , more autonomous stage is perhaps best illustrated by the debate in Congress last year over the Navy 's Unmanned Carrier-Launched Airborne Surveillance and Strike program , UCLASS for short . Its progenitor , the Northrop X-47 test aircraft , has been able to perform one of the toughest human pilot tasks of all -- taking off from and landing on an aircraft carrier -- and is now being tested on functions like air-to-air refueling and partnering with manned planes . UCLASS is the next stage of a more advanced , jet-powered and stealthy system going operational .
But the main debate is not whether to deploy such drones as a regular part of a carrier 's air wing , but how much of their role would be for reconnaissance -- or whether they would follow the natural evolution into a focus on bombing and strike missions , seeking to cause damage to any enemy they find , not just watching them . That is just what happened with those early manned airplanes a century ago .
Similarly , the British are testing an unmanned system called Taranis that is not just jet-powered and stealthy but also explores new target selection software .
We are not yet in the world of the Terminators or `` The Matrix , '' where machines make their own decisions on when and where to go to war . Nor is the human role disappearing from war , or old technology going away . The current Iraq War 3.0 has all the players -- the U.S. , ISIS , Iran , and Iraqi government forces -- using both drones and traditional boots on the ground .
But it is clear that something important is afoot in the discussion of humans , our technology and our wars . The human role has shifted from being `` in the loop '' of decision with our machines , making all the key calls to , as a U.S. Air Force report described it , `` on the loop `` of decision , where our role is more to manage than to direct the operations of robots . Cyberconflict is one area in which artificial intelligence and software algorithms increasingly make most of the decisions at digital speed .
The looming debate then is whether that human role will ever move ultimately `` out of the loop . '' Many are deeply concerned by this prospect , arguing that it should be nipped in the bud , just as many wish H.G . Wells ' concept of an `` atomic bomb '' had never been invented . They 've started to organize to prevent research into autonomous armed robots and called for arms treaties banning the technology .
Whether that is possible remains to be seen , as both science and war have a long history of escaping their bounds . But one thing is clear : Like the present , the future of war will be robotic .

San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick , who has staged a protest during the national anthem since the preseason , does not plan to participate in Tuesday 's election .
Asked if they had already voted early Tuesday afternoon , Kaepernick only told reporters `` no , '' according to Eric Branch of the San Francisco Chronicle . They gave the same response when asked if they planned to vote later .
Kaepernick previously expressed disdain for both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump as presidential candidates .
`` It was embarrassing to watch that these are our two candidates , '' Kaepernick said in September after the first presidential debate . `` Both are proven liars and it almost seems like they 're trying to debate who 's less racist .
`` And at this point ... you have to pick the lesser of two evils . But in the end , it 's still evil . ''
Kaepernick first sat and now takes a knee during the playing of the anthem before games to protest wrongdoings against African-Americans and other minorities , they said .

Officials in Mexico say that they have killed a drug lord who was reported to have been shot dead three years ago .
Nazario Moreno , known as El Mas Loco - The Craziest One - was the founder of the La Familia cartel and regarded as the spiritual leader of its offshoot , the brutal Knights Templar .
Their death was first announced after a 2010 shootout , but no body was found and they were reportedly seen alive since .
Police said they were finally tracked down and shot dead in Michoacan state .
`` From a fingerprint analysis we have confirmed 100 % that this was Nazario Moreno Gonzalez , '' said Tomas Zeron , the head of investigations at the federal prosecutor 's office .
'Dangerous person '
Government security spokesperson Alejandro Rubido said security officials had been tracking Moreno for some time .
Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Mexican authorities , speaking in 2010 , said Nazario Moreno died in clashes
`` Anonymous tips indicated that Nazario Moreno was not only living , but continued operating at the head of a criminal group conducting extortion , kidnapping and other crimes , '' they said at a news briefing in Mexico City .
`` This person was known as dangerous , '' they said , with police believing they had committed multiple murders since their reported death .
Image copyright AFP Image caption Police used fingerprints to confirm the identity of the dead body
Mr Rubido said Moreno was stopped by police on Sunday morning in the village of Tumbiscatio in Michoacan state .
`` When they were asked to turn themselves in , they opened fire and was killed , '' they said .
Moreno , 43 , was the founder of the La Familia cartel , which dominated the drugs trade in Michoacan but was believed to have been severely weakened by their reported death .

Controls much of the methamphetamine and marijuana trade in western Mexico Q & A : Mexico 's drug-related violence
Its breakaway group , the Knights Templar - know for its brutality and its use of religious imagery - subsequently took over many of the cartel 's operations and runs much of the methamphetamine production and trafficking in the west of Mexico .
The BBC 's Mexico correspondent Will Grant says Moreno 's killing is a second major success for the government 's campaign against the drugs trade within a month .
In late February , Joaquin Guzman , known as El Chapo or `` Shorty '' was arrested in Sinaloa state .
Their Sinaloa cartel is believed to be one of the biggest criminal organisations in the world , trafficking drugs into more than 50 countries worldwide .
They were one of Mexico 's most-wanted men and had been on the run since escaping a high-security prison in a laundry basket in 2001 .
Some 60,000 people have died across Mexico since 2006 when the previous government under Felipe Calderon deployed the military against the drugs gangs .
Ever since the dawn of aquafaba I 've been thinking of other ways to use it as an egg replacer . I 've used it to make meringue and to give body to ice cream without using an ice cream maker .
Here I 'm using it to make a simple sweet pastry ( one used by my grandma ) without the need to use any expensive exotic ingredients . Obviously , the pie is filled with cherries because there 's a damn fine crop of cherries popping up this year !
A tragedy befell us in the kitchen . My beloved Salter digital scales got water in them and died ! So I 've gone back to the old school with this recipe and measured them using my great-grandma 's weighted scales which are in ounces . I 've done my best to convert to grams but be aware !
INGREDIENTS
8oz/226g plain flour
4oz/113 fat ( I used a half/half ratio of vegan butter to vegetable fat )
2oz/56g aquafaba ( liquid drained from a can of chickpeas ) + more for brushing
1oz/28g caster sugar
300g cherries , pitted
2 tbsp caster sugar
2 tsp vanilla extract
Preheat the oven to 350f . Get a 7 inch pie dish ready . Start by making the pastry . In a large mixing bowl add the flour and fat . Using your hands rub the fat through the flour until the mixture resembles coarse sand . Stir in the sugar . Make a well in the middle of the flour then add the aquafaba , using a wooden spoon to mix it all together . Lightly flour your kitchen surface , then plop the dough out of the bowl . Knead lightly for around 5 minutes until the pastry is smooth . Roll into a ball and place in a ziplock bag . Chill the pastry in the fridge for at least 1 hour . Whilst the pastry is chilling , start on the cherry filling . Pit the cherries – I find the easiest way is to use an empty wine bottle and a chopstick . Place 1 cherry in the opening of the wine bottle and use the sharp end of the chopstick to push out the pit . Once all the cherries are pitted add them to a saucepan with the 2 tablespoons of sugar and vanilla extract . Cook on a medium-low heat until the juices run out and the fruit is soft . Set aside to cool . Divide the pastry into two equal parts.Flour your surface and roll out one piece of pastry into an 8 inch circle and carefully lay it over the pie dish . Using your fingers press the pastry into the dish . Cut away the excess pastry . Scoop out the cherries using a slotted spoon , making sure not too take much of the juice , into the pie casing . Roll out your second piece of dough and carefully lay it over the top of the pie . Using your thumb press all the way around the edge of the dish to seal the pastry . Cut away the excess pastry.Then using your finger , press the thumb sealed part inwards to make a little flute . If you want to , you can use your excess pastry to make a little decoration ! Cut two slits in the top of the pie crust then brush it with a little aquafaba . Bake the pie in the oven for 25 minutes or until golden brown , rotating half way .

5 out of 5 one of the best Virginian blends hands down this is my favorite Virginian blend . smooth and sweet from beginning to end . i keep enough on had to smoke all year long !
3 out of 5 Once Bitten ... ! ! ! Very disappointed in this blend . Bought the 2016 figuring it already had a year 's worth of aging . Then I let it age a couple of months more after opening the tin . Nice aroma and flavor , but serious tongue bite and I puff slowly . Maybe I was doing something wrong but every other tobacco I 've tried except ofc `` yuck '' brands are bereft of bite . Unless more aging games the beast in this can , it is my last one .
5 out of 5 Not for another 2 years . Got two tins of Christmas cheer 2016 and 17 , both are being cellard . I might get a third so I can compare the difference time will do to it .
5 out of 5 Moist , but great . Little moist at first , needed some drying time . All in all good smoke . McClelland is my go to for tobacco .
4 out of 5 Spread the Cheer . This has the wonderful McClelland smell when you crack the tin . The broken flake is a bit wet it does need to sit out before packing . The initial char light did n't have any taste but after second match the Virginia taste seemed faint . This may need some time to age .
5 out of 5 Best Tobacco Available I have been smoking a pipe since the 1960s . McClelland Virginia tobaccos are reminiscent of British and European tobaccos from that period . Very high quality and available at a fair price . The 2016 Christmas Cheer blend is typically superb if you are a Virginia tobacco fan .
5 out of 5 Christmas came early This is a really nice blend . Having just gotten bit by the bug earlier this year , I have n't gotten the chance to try previous years . But this is a wonderful musty Va , there is a nice holiday spice to this tobacco without the syrupy sweetness of an aromatic .
5 out of 5 McClelland Christmas Cheer pipe tobacco Fast delivery , well packed and protected . A good smoke .
3 out of 5 Decent Tobacco I tried both the McClelland Christmas Cheer and Holiday Spirit this year . I much preferred the Holiday Spirit to the Christmas Cheer . The Holiday Spirit has a much better smell and flavor . So I would give Holiday Spirit 5 Stars but Christmas Cheer only 3 .
5 out of 5 Excellent blends with great artwork McClelland is known for their superlative pipe tobacco blends . Christmas Cheer is no exception . The Virginia 's used in Christmas Cheer are undoubtedly of the highest quality with a unique flavor profile of natural sweetness . The tin note is reminiscent of fresh Rainier cherries and tangy apple skins . The mouth feel is full bodied , delicate and clean . When smoked with intention , this carefully crafted blend will offer a plethora of flavors that open up afresh with each puff . Highly recommended ! An excellent blend to cellar for many years , as these pressed Virginia 's only get better with age .
3 out of 5 Not So Special I am not impressed .

When contemplating the failure of the War on Poverty after 50 years and $ 22 trillion spent , I mentioned the outrageous government overhead , waste , and fraud that makes up a big part of that figure . It 's both absurd and immoral to talk about the benefits of any program without looking at its cost and efficiency . I say “ immoral ” because seizing money from law-abiding taxpayers to finance programs known to be corrupt , on a massive scale , is nothing less than theft . The morality of such actions can still be debatable even when the programs work fairly well , but when they clearly do n't , their immorality becomes obvious . The same can be said about ObamaCare , which is spending so much to accomplish so little that its remaining defenders should be laughed out of polite society .
You could fill volumes with the stories of welfare-state abuse , as Howie Carr at the Boston Globe clearly knows , because they relate the tale of Food Stamp Nation resident , drug dealer , and million-dollar lottery winner Gary Bond with an air of weary resignation :
Of course they took the one-time payment — $ 650,000 . According to the Lottery , after 25 percent federal taxes and 5 percent state taxes , they netted $ 455,000 . Not bad . Do you have $ 455,000 cash in a bank account , or even under your mattress ? I 'll bet you can see where this story is going . As has often been noted , not every person who has an EBT card is a drug dealer . But every drug dealer has an EBT card . So the Haverhill cops go into Gary Bond 's “ subsidized apartment ” ( another popular public-sector perk among the EBT community ) , and they report finding a little more than 1 ounce of marijuana , 21 grams of cocaine and ( a rather disappointing ) three Oxycontin pills . Haverhill police also reported seizing $ 974 in cash , three Apple iPhones , brass knuckles , an airsoft gun and a machete — in other words , the usual EBT accessories . Not to mention , two EBT cards , one belonging to Gary Bond and another to their wife , Fritzlaine Liautaud , 30 . If he 'd taken the yearly payments from the Lottery , a court could have ordered that the money be stopped . But of course Gary U.S . Bond knew that . They got the money , and how much do you figure is still around ? Just a hunch , but I 'm going to bet that they and their wife both claim that they are “ indigent ” and will demand public defenders . Just like more high-profile criminals like Dzhokhar Tsarnaev , Whitey Bulger and Speaker Sal DiMasi . Gary U.S . Bond had a prior conviction , but they were given probation . Of course they are . They had an EBT card . That makes them good people — just ask Deval Patrick .
That would be the same Deval Patrick currently discussed as a possible successor to Attorney General Eric Holder . Which would be appropriate , since being the Attorney General has very little to do with enforcing the law , especially when it 's time to enforce it against the almighty State and its special friends .
How many times this year have arrested drug dealers been found with multiple EBT cards — remember the woman in Taunton with 12 , count 'em 12 , EBT cards ? Dealers take them as collateral for the next fix . And you wonder why hundreds of thousands of the cards are “ lost ” every year , compared to how few traditional credit cards go missing .
Somehow the biggest , best-funded welfare system ever conceived , administered by the largest and most powerful government apparatus in human history , is unable to crack down on even the most outrageous cases of abuse . That 's because they do n't want to , any more than they want to crack down on illegal immigration . Our money-no-object super-government suddenly becomes helpless when asked to do anything that would reduce its power and funding , such as reducing the size of the welfare state it harvests so much power , money , and electoral support from .
Even moving food stamp benefits onto electronic cards – of the sort private industry secures and monitors , with a high level of confidence , by the hundreds of millions – barely made a dent in the most deranged forms of abuse . That 's partially due to the general incompetence of the same zillion-dollar government that brought you HealthCareDotGov , but it 's mostly because the people on the administrative end of those electronic systems have little interest in using them to their full potential .
Could you build the Empire State Building out of wood ?
Not just a tabletop model , mind you — but the whole 102-story , 87,000-square-foot skyscraper , covering a New York City block at its base , and for 40 years the world 's tallest building at 1,250 feet ?
Of course you could , say the Vancouver architect Michael Green and the Finnish engineers at Metsä Wood . And it would be a good idea — economically , environmentally and , not least , aesthetically .
Green has a significant following in architectural and construction circles for championing wood as a preferred alternative to concrete and steel for large buildings ; my MinnPost colleague Peter Callaghan has written about their design for a seven-story office building that Hines Interests hopes to build in Minneapolis ' North Loop .
Metsä Wood , for its part , has earned a global reputation for quality and creativity in turning the world 's oldest construction material into some of its newest and most beautiful building components .
So their collaboration on a re-imagined Empire State Building , with additional technical input from Equilibrium Consulting , has been getting considerable attention in architectural and construction-trades publications — not to mention an admiring write-up last week from architecture columnist Philip Oldfield of the U.K . Guardian .
Here 's the point that Green and Metsä are trying to drive home with attention-getting images like the one you see above :
The world is going through a high-rise building boom , using materials and construction methods essentially unchanged since “ skyscraper ” came to mean a steel-and-concrete office tower ( as opposed to a mast-topping sail on a square-rigged ship ; Ian Fleming fans , see also “ moonraker . ” )
At the same time , we 're continuing to load the atmosphere with globe-warming carbon dioxide . And while high-rise construction by itself is n't among the biggest contributors , steel- and cement-making are fairly carbon-intensive .
So substituting wood offers some significant offsets , including :
A smaller carbon footprint throughout all phases of putting the building up , from iron mining through I-beam transportation to welding .
Vastly extended sequestration of tree-captured carbon in wood products that are preserved for generations , as opposed to wood that 's used for fuel , left to decompose , or turned into short-cycle goods like cardboard or newsprint .
Construction components that may well outlive a building , and can be re-used in new structures .
Nature 's tall wood structures
Courtesy of Metsä Wood Trees in the Pacific Northwest routinely grow to 30 or 40 stories in height . The Empire State Building re-conceived in wood would be a bit taller . ( Click for larger version of diagram .
If you pause to think about it , it 's actually kind of strange that nowadays a merely seven-story wooden building like Hines ' T3 project should qualify as a paradigm-breaker and national first of its kind . Especially in a region that owes its existence in large part to lumber production .
After all , as Michael Green is fond of pointing out , trees in the Pacific Northwest routinely grow to 30 or 40 stories in height . And in a sort of manifesto entitled “ The Case for Tall Wood Buildings , ” they note that :
Tall wood buildings are not a new concept . 1,400 years ago tall pagodas in Japan were built to 19 storeys in wood and still stand today in high seismic , wet climate environments . Several countries around the world have a history of building Tall Wood buildings . In Vancouver 's Gastown neighbourhood 7 and 10 storey heavy timber buildings have stood for the last hundred years .
Only somewhat newer is the notion of materials Green calls “ mass timber , ” which you could think of as plywood multiplied : laminated panels , beams and trusses of wood-fiber sheets pressed and glued together for almost limitless potential variation in weight , strength , flexibility , weather resistance and finish .
Even more important — and here 's where Metsä comes in — the panels can be made to order near the wood sources and shipped in finished form to the construction sites , ready to be assembled with custom fasteners of a type familiar to anyone who has ever assembled an end table from IKEA .
Only bigger .
For a 35-story building that Green has designed as part of a Parisian project called Baobab , the panels would be nearly 16 inches thick ; for the Metropol Parasol project already built in the Spanish city of Seville , Metsä supplied laminated components up to 54 feet long , in thicknesses from 2½ to 12 inches .
Still , as Green told the Guardian 's Oldfield , because “ their manufacture is very accurate , there 's very little work that needs to be done on site . Because of this , construction will be very quick . Someday I 'd like to make a building where all you need is a giant Allen key to put it together . ”
Courtesy of Metsä Wood The Metropol Parasol project in Seville , Spain houses an archeological museum and farmers market as well as bars , restaurants and terraces .
So , what about fire ?
One of tall wood 's public relations challenges is the assumption that wood skyscrapers ca n't be made fire-safe . Oldfield 's take is that “ there 's a huge difference in terms of physical properties between mass timber , such as cross-laminated timber , and the lightweight timber frames that are perceived as being susceptible to fire . ”
When mass timber is exposed to fire , the outer layer starts to burn and form charcoal . The charcoal layer forms a protective barrier , soaking up heat and insulating the interior timber . As exposure to fire increases , this layer grows , creating even more insulation , and further slowing the burning rate . In timber towers the thickness of the charcoal layer that would form in a fire can be predicted . To protect the structural integrity of the timber , this same thickness of wood can be added to the CLT sheets . This would form a sacrificial timber barrier which would char in a fire , and in doing so , protect the material within . “ It 's mother nature doing what they do best , ” says David Barber , a principal fire protection engineer at Arup in Washington , D.C. , and an author on a report on the fire safety challenges of wood tall buildings . “ In the aftermath of a forest fire you 'll see trunks of trees that are black and charred . The timber inside the charcoal layer is still alive – after a fire you will see regeneration . This is the same physical property we utilise in timber towers . ”
Steel-and-concrete towers are also vulnerable to fire , of course , because those materials lose strength to extreme heat . Metsä had the good taste not to mention a couple of towers that burned in Manhattan while all the world was watching , but it did make this comparative observation about an Empire State Building constructed with its Kerto panels :
In the event of a fire , Kerto LVL performs more predictably than many non-combustible materials… . To achieve the fire ratings required for a 102-story building , additional fire protection would still be required in the form of sprinklers , and drywall , but many parts of the wood structure could remain exposed . In contrast , the steel structure of the Empire State Building needs to be fully protected by insulation , drywall , stone and other fire resistant materials to provide safe resistance to fire .
Now , nobody really expects to see the Empire State Building rebuilt as a plyscraper .
Green and Metsa are out to prove a larger point about wood as a high-rise material ; having taken the Empire State project through the conceptual phase , they 've begun a technical design to yield detailed projections of costs , construction time and environmental benefits .
For Metsä , it 's part of a multistage demonstration project called Plan B that has already imagined the Colosseum of ancient Rome resurrected in mass timber , with other iconic buildings to come .
They 're working real-world buildings , too — if not on the monumental scale of Empire State , then certainly larger than most of us have thought possible with wood .
Over a year and a half since they last played in an NBA game , Rasheed Wallace will come out of retirement and sign with the Lakers , according to A. Sherrod Blakely of CSNNE.com .
Wallace played for the Celtics in 2009/10 , but had the rest of their contract bought out by the team and retired that summer . While the 37-year-old has n't played since Game 7 of the 2010 NBA Finals , they were said to be contemplating a comeback earlier this season .
The Lakers , with 14 players on their roster , wo n't have to make a move to clear a spot for Wallace . There had been speculation that the team could sign Gilbert Arenas using that roster spot , but the Lakers did n't make a move after watching Arenas work out in L.A. As for Wallace , Blakely hears from sources that a renewed conditioning regimen has the veteran big man looking better than they have `` in years . '' Still , as a rival executive tells Blakely , Wallace will merely provide bench depth for the Lakers — adding them does n't necessarily mean the team is more inclined to move Pau Gasol .
Marc J. Spears of Yahoo Sports reported in early February that the Lakers may have some interest in Wallace if Kenyon Martin signed elsewhere . Martin , of course , ended up in Los Angeles , but signed with the Clippers , not the Lakers .
This bill is a step forward so that you know who is paying to influence your vote and your elected leaders .
Critics of the proposed changes to Minnesota 's campaign-finance law have labeled the reforms as a way for the DFL to silence opposition and tell the nonprofit community to “ shut up. ” The truth is that the legislation merely asks : “ Who 's talking ? ” Its purpose is disclosure of those who are trying to influence the vote — be they Democrat , Republican , or nonpartisan .
Sherri Knuth
The pending legislation ( SF 1915/HF1944 ) enacts modest reforms by expanding disclosure requirements to include electioneering communications . Disclosure applies when an organization targets recipients — such as a House district — with information , to influence the election of a candidate in proximity to an election .
If the organization reaches a designated financial threshold , it will have to identify that it paid for the ad or mailing and disclose what the organization spent and who donated the money . There are significant exceptions , such as communications to the organization 's own members .
We are in this situation because in 2010 the Supreme Court ruled that in the world of political donations , special interests are the same as people . The Citizens United decision opened the door for unlimited , undisclosed donations to political action committees ( PACs ) , most of which specialize in mudslinging in the month leading up to an election .
Sometimes called ‘ sham issue ads '
The ads themselves are referred to as electioneering communications or sometimes “ sham issue ads ” because , although they explicitly mention a candidate with the purpose of persuading someone to vote for them or vote for anyone but them , they do n't use the “ magic words ” of advocacy such as “ vote for ” or “ defeat . ”
Twenty five other states already have disclosure requirements in place for electioneering communications , as does the federal government . But in Minnesota , organizations do n't even have to identify the name of the group behind such an ad , and that 's a problem .
Jeremy Schroeder
The proposed Minnesota legislation is finely tuned . Nonprofits will be able to distribute scorecards to members or post scorecards on their websites without triggering disclosure requirements . Disclosure requirements would be triggered if the nonprofit publishes the scorecard and sends it to constituents of a particular House or Senate district to influence the election of an identified candidate .
If a tax-exempt nonprofit is putting out educational materials , it will continue to be able to do so . Already 501 ( c ) ( 3 ) s are prohibited by IRS regulations from activity to influence the election of a particular candidate , so they will not be affected at all .
Further , disclosure will be required only when communications that come under the terms of the legislation exceed $ 1,500 in a calendar year .
Disclosure will illuminate more dark money
True , some activity aimed at influencing elections that was not reported in the past will now be subject to disclosure . But the outcome will be to illuminate more of the dark money that is pouring into our political system , primarily through well-financed PACs . To paint the proposed electioneering legislation as governmental overreach or as an attempt by a political party to shut out nonpartisan groups is a gross misunderstanding of this disclosure bill .
Do n't be fooled by those who would have you think this is a step backward . Citizens United was the step backward . All of us evaluate what we see and hear based in part on who 's doing the talking . This bill is a step forward so that you know who is paying to influence your vote and your elected leaders .

Facebook wants people watching TV-style shows right inside the social network .
So the company is talking with Hollywood studios and other producers about licensing `` scripted , unscripted and sports content . ''
That means sitcoms , dramas , sporting events and other types of programming could be coming to Facebook in the coming months .
For now Facebook is characterizing this as an experiment . The closest parallels are the company 's recent payments to news organizations and other media companies to make live video , which helped to introduce Facebook Live to the public earlier this year .
Now Facebook is seeking pre-taped and scripted programming . In both cases the overarching goal is the same : to encourage users to spend more time interacting with content on Facebook .
The company is just starting to have conversations with possible media partners for pre-taped programming , a spokesperson said .
Recode was first to report on the talks on Wednesday .
`` Earlier this year , we started rolling out the Video tab , a dedicated place for video on Facebook . Our goal is to kickstart an ecosystem of partner content for the tab , so we 're exploring funding some seed video content , including original and licensed scripted , unscripted , and sports content , that takes advantage of mobile and the social interaction unique to Facebook , '' Ricky Van Veen , the company 's head of global creative strategy , said in a statement .
`` Our goal is to show people what is possible on the platform and learn as we continue to work with video partners around the world , '' they added .
The increased competition for spots at Chivas has left striker Erick Torres on the outside looking in .
Erick `` Cubo '' Torres is not happy at their lack of league minutes for Chivas , but they do n't regret their temporary return to their hometown team .
The Houston Dynamo striker , loaned back to relegation-threatened Chivas for the 2015 Liga MX Clausura , has become a cup specialist so far . And that is n't what they came for .
`` I came with the mentality and the idea of getting minutes in the league , but as they have n't come , I have to wait a little , '' said Torres to reporters in Guadalajara on Wednesday . `` ( The lack of Liga MX minutes ) is down to something , it 's because the coaching staff sees it that way and nothing more . ''
Torres ' form in MLS in 2013 and 2014 for the now-defunct Chivas USA earned them three caps for the Mexico national team at the back end of last year . But at Chivas this season , they have played just 30 minutes of the team 's eight Liga MX games and failed to make the 18-man roster for this weekend 's league contest at Queretaro . Captain Omar Bravo is the figurehead of the side upfront and closing in on Salvador `` Chava '' Reyes ' record as the club 's top scorer , while Aldo de Nigris offers a more physical presence and is enjoying a mini-revival of late . Torres , it appears , is almost surplus to requirements , with coach Jose Manuel `` Chepo '' de la Torre fielding only one central striker .
The result is that Torres ' position for El Tri this summer is under threat . The 22-year-old may have scored two goals in their six starts in the Copa MX , but it is unlikely to be enough .
`` I try to do things well in training and in the cup , '' stated Cubo , who claimed not to know if they might join Houston Dynamo before the end of the Liga MX season . `` I 'm just thinking about Chivas and a national team call-up . ''
Torres is n't the only youngster at Chivas facing the problem of minimal Liga MX playing time . Goalkeeper Antonio Rodriguez is regarded as a future Mexico international and was even mentioned by Miguel Herrera last month as a goalkeeper they were watching , but they lost their starting spot at Chivas after the first round of matches in the Clausura and is now playing alongside Torres in the Copa MX games .
`` These have been the most difficult two months I 've gone through in all my life , '' Rodriguez told reporters after Chivas ' 1-0 Copa MX win over Irapuato in Guadalajara on Tuesday . `` ( Getting dropped ) affected me a little . It was Round 2 ( of games ) . I 've no idea ( why ) . I work and nothing more , I 'll do the best I can whenever they play me . ''
De la Torre and club president Nestor de la Torre reign supreme at Chivas at present . Chepo has opted for experience -- putting in veteran Luis Michel for Rodriguez -- and no one will get in the way if they want to make decisions that go against the grain .
And now that Chivas are winning games -- the club has secured victory in its past five in all competitions -- the issue of Torres and Rodriguez have been swept under the carpet ; minor grievances as the team positions itself to avoid relegation and perhaps even make the playoffs in the second half of the Clausura .
Indeed , the strength in depth Chivas have at present is arguably one of the fundamental reasons for the club 's upturn in recent weeks . In last Sunday 's 3-0 win over Monterrey , the bench was made up of three players with full international caps ( Torres , Angel Reyna , Fernando Arce ) , along with two Olympic gold medal-winners ( Rodriguez , Nestor Vidrio ) . The much-hyped Jorge `` Chaton '' Enriquez was left out of the squad altogether , as was Bravo .
`` The competition has been very strong , '' said Bravo after last Sunday 's win . `` Since the squad was put together , there 's been no negative in whoever is in form playing . Aldo ( de Nigris ) is doing well , 'Cubo ' has scored and if those upfront are in form it is good for us . ''
The jockeying for positions in the starting XI and to make the 18 has to be good for the side overall and fifth-place Chivas go into Friday 's match against Ronaldinho 's Queretaro -- 17th in the Liga MX -- full of confidence .
Chivas have lost only twice in the past 10 years in the Estadio Corregidora and although De la Torre has never managed a win over a Victor Manuel Vucetich team in a league match , Guadalajara is the clear favorite .
Relegation is still an issue , but a victory over Gallos Blancos will move Chivas into the dizzy heights of second in the Liga MX table , at least temporarily .

A new report released by Yale , `` Americans ' Knowledge Of Climate Change , '' reveals an extremely alarming absence of accurate information when it comes to what Americans know about the climate and energy . The report 's findings are based on a survey of 2,030 American adults and include some shocking results , such as a large belief that fossil fuels are the fossilized remains of dinosaurs , rockets punching holes in the ozone contribute to global warming , and that some actually believe global warming is beneficial .
Yale 's researchers found that 52 % of those surveyed would receive a failing grade for their knowledge of the climate change and energy issues they were surveyed on , while only 8 % got an A or B .
In a time rife with so many intentional efforts to obscure the reality about climate change , it 's understandable that many Americans would be confused and misinformed about vital issues relating to energy and the climate . That 's why we 're presenting The Huffington Post Spotlight series on energy , where we bring together leading experts to debate controversial topics like nuclear power , natural gas and our energy future .
GO HERE to submit your questions for the debates , and read on to see some of the most shocking misconceptions Americans have about climate change and energy .

I was skimming through headlines on my RSS feed this past weekend when a particular title caught my eye – it simply read : “ Situational Ethics. ” Have we really devolved to this level of thinking ? Situational Ethics – Really ? If ever there was an oxymoron this is it . While this phrase seems to be getting play in some circles , my opinion is that it 's nothing more than the latest politically correct sound-bite which attempts to rationalize and justify wrong thinking and wrong behavior . Life is full of areas that benefit from flexibility , fluidity , context , and other forms of nuanced thinking , but ethics is n't one of them . If the title of today 's post seems a bit rigid for you , I encourage you to read on and see why rigidity in certain areas can be highly productive .
Here 's the thing – leadership begins and ends with trust . Trust is built on a foundation of the constancy of your character , and if your ethics are situational , then I would submit so is your character . You can not effectively serve those you lead if you fail to earn and keep their trust . I would challenge you to view those whom you might label as black and white not as lacking sophistication , but as possessing a clear view of right and wrong . People who display the clarity and confidence to consistently do the right thing regardless of the current situation have reached a level of leadership maturity to be applauded not mocked .
I want to be clear – situational or contextual leadership is not the same thing as applying situational ethics . The former asks a leader to adapt strategy or tactics while the latter asks the leader to adapt principle – big difference . I would suspect that those who apply situational ethics in their thinking also likely subscribe to the theory of moral relativism . They believe anything can be justified or rationalized by the need at hand , or worse yet , manipulated for a desired outcome . While some might believe this constitutes right thinking , I believe it constitutes flawed thinking . Thinking that supports a means to an end mentality is dangerous and ultimately should not be trusted .
If you pay close attention to those who practice situational ethics you find them to be masters of spin , who while often appearing to do things right , often fail to do the right thing . People who fall into this camp frequently exhibit an inconsistency in their reasoning and/or positioning . While they would describe themselves as flexible , fluid , and open-minded , my take is that their character lacks integrity and can be easily influenced . When a person allows popular opinion , or situational characteristics to either define or supersede their principles , then I suggest their character is flawed . Simply put , my contention would be that if you serve as your own moral compass , your character will only be as good or bad as your thinking at that time .
It was Ralph Waldo Emerson who said , “ Character is higher than intellect. ” I could not agree more with Emerson as virtually anyone can develop their intellect , but it is the rare person who can retain their character . Emerson clearly understood the law of scarcity in placing more value on character . The most successful business leaders of our time have built their personal brand by consistently exhibiting strong character regardless of the situation at hand . They let right thinking , right decisioning and right acting serve as their guide . If you have to manipulate the truth or compromise your values to gain an advantage , the advantage is not worth the perceived gain , for any advantage gained in deceit will surely come at a very high cost – the sacrifice of your character .
Do you have to be perfect to be a leader ? Absolutely not – as much as some wo n't want to hear or admit it , we all have character flaws . The thing is , character flaws do n't necessarily equate to a lack of character – this is n't situational rationalization , it 's a fact . We all have chinks in our armor , have had lapses in character , and have at one point or another broken trust with someone . We know how it feels to hurt and be hurt . The issue is not one of perfection or flawless character , but rather understanding our flaws and working diligently to have them be the rare exception and not the rule . The real trick is to focus on issues larger than ourselves . Real leaders understand that leadership has little to do with them – they are simply role players who have a job to do . In order to do that job well they must focus on something bigger than themselves , serve those around them , and not let their ego , pride , and arrogance overshadow their humility and empathy .
Bottom line , if you want to avoid falling on your face – avoid slippery slopes . Thoughts ?
North Korea has been hit by a new set of United Nations sanctions following the country 's latest nuclear test on 3 September .
The sanctions target gas and oil imports and ban textile exports from the secretive state , as well as limiting the number of foreign workers it can send abroad .
The resolution imposes a ban on condensates and natural gas liquids , a cap of two million barrels a year on refined petroleum products , and a cap on crude oil exports to North Korea at current levels . China supplies most of North Korea 's crude .
: : Why UN sanctions alone wo n't stop Kim Jong-un
N Korea defector on brutal reality
But consensus has come at a cost .
In order to ensure the support of Russia and North Korea 's only major ally , China , Western diplomats had to weaken parts of the resolution , including freezing the assets of leader Kim Jong-un .
US ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley said : `` These are by far the strongest measures ever imposed on North Korea .
`` Today we are saying that the world will never accept a nuclear-armed North Korea . ''
The story of N Korea 's nuclear tests
Speaking on the 16th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks , they said : `` We will never forget that those who have evil intentions must be confronted . ''
Defence Secretary Sir Michael Fallon said the sanctions `` are n't perfect '' , but were a `` step forward '' in increasing international pressure on Pyongyang .
They told Sky News : `` These sanctions to toughen up the action we 're taking on the regime . For example , they restrict the amount of money that North Korean workers can go and earn abroad and send back to the North Korean regime .
`` So they will help starve the North Korean regime of the money that it 's been using from abroad to continue its nuclear programme .
`` One way or another we have to get this nuclear programme stopped because it is a threat to all of us . I 've pointed out this involves us , we are closer to these nuclear weapons than Los Angeles . ''
British ambassador to the UN Matthew Rycroft said : `` There is a significant prize in keeping the whole of the Security Council united .
`` We are tightening the screw , and we stand prepared to tighten it further . ''
The unanimously passed resolution will impose the latest in a string of sanctions .
China 's big four state-owned banks have also stopped providing financial services to new clients from North Korea , according to branch staff .
Concerns have been raised by the US that Beijing has not done enough in the face of repeated nuclear tests by the North Korean regime .
China Construction Bank ( CCB ) has `` completely prohibited business with North Korea '' , a bank teller at the company told Reuters .
Pyongyang appears unbowed , threatening that America would pay a `` price '' for spearheading the measures against it .
The lesson , then , that many Jewish kids absorb at an early age is that their heritage comes with responsibilities—especially when it comes to getting married and having kids .
In large part , that 's because Jewish organizations put a lot of time and money into spreading precisely this message . For the Jewish leaders who believe this is important for the future of the faith , youth group , road trips , summer camp , and online dating are the primary tools they use in the battle to preserve their people .
* * *
Youth Group , the Twenty-First Century Yenta
Although Judaism encompasses enormous diversity in terms of how people choose to observe their religion , leaders from the most progressive to the most Orthodox movements basically agree : If you want to persuade kids to marry other Jews , do n't be too pushy .
“ We try not to hit them over the head with it too frequently or too often , ” said Rabbi Micah Greenland , who directs the National Conference of Synagogue Youth ( NCSY ) , an Orthodox-run organization that serves about 25,000 high school students each year . “ But our interpersonal relationships are colored by our Judaism , and our dating and marriage decisions are equally Jewish decisions . ”
On the opposite end of the spectrum of observance , a Reform organization , the North American Federation of Temple Youth ( NFTY ) , seems to take a similar tack , especially in response to frequent questions from donors and congregants about intermarriage trends . “ Our response to [ concerns about ] intermarriage is less to have conversations about dating—we want to have larger conversations about what it means to be Jewish , ” said the director of youth engagement , Rabbi Bradley Solmsen , who estimated that NFTY serves about 17,700 Jewish students each year .
But make no mistake : This does n't mean they have a laissez-faire attitude about intermarriage . In every denomination , the leaders I talked with are thinking intentionally about how to strengthen the sense of connection among teenaged Jews .
“ There 's no question that one of the purposes of the organization is to keep Jewish social circles together at this age , ” said Matt Grossman , the executive director of the non-denominational organization BBYO , which serves about 39,000 American students each year .
“ If they 're in an environment where their closest friends are Jewish , the likelihood that they 're going to end up dating people from those social circles , and ultimately marry someone from those social circles , increases dramatically , ” Grossman said .
Organizations like Hillel , a non-denominational campus outreach organization , have gathered data on the most efficient ways of encouraging these friendships . “ If you have students reaching out to other students to get them involved in Jewish life , and when an educator is paired with them , they end up having more Jewish friends than your average student , ” said Abi Dauber-Sterne , the vice president for “ Jewish experiences . ”
Residents of the real world most likely know the great American meritocracy is a lie . And yet , we are so heavily indoctrinated that even the most unsurprising revelations can feel shocking . Case in point is the new book Dream Hoarders , which examines the growing gap between rich and poor .
The author , economics professor and Brookings Institution fellow Richard Reeves , notes that while the US has always had a class system , the upper middle class – which they define as those earning $ 120,000 a year or more – is not only widening the gap between itself and everyone else , but also hoarding opportunities in a way that makes it difficult for any outsiders to climb up to it . ( The 1 % is getting richer even more quickly , of course , but there are n't enough of them to hoard opportunities on a mass scale . )
While people like Donald Trump would like you to think the American economy is a magical font of money that will bless every last citizen who deserves it , the truth is it 's a zero-sum game ; there are only so many good jobs , spots in elite colleges and tony area codes to go around .
And the top 20 % have set things up to guarantee virtually all of those spoils go to their children , as well as their children 's children , leaving the bottom 80 % little to work with . Society is growing increasingly segmented along class lines , which intersects a great deal with race in a horrid Venn diagram of oppression .
As Reeves notes , this is not usually due to direct classism , although he 's appalled that American universities admit to giving preferential treatment to “ legacy ” students . Rather , those who got a head start in life are set up to succeed from the very beginning , when they attend well-funded public elementary schools , to the middle , when they get internships because of who they know . ( I would also add that only the upper crust can afford to do unpaid internships . )
The American dream ? Top 20 % pulling away from the rest , study finds Read more
By the time they enter the job market , they have considerable advantages over everyone else . And then they inherit vast sums of wealth . All the while , they use the myth of meritocracy to justify their position .
On a micro level , these behaviors are understandable . What parent would n't do everything in their power to ensure the best possible life for their children ? But carried out on a mass level , they lead to what Reeves characterizes as “ a less competitive economy , as well as a less open society ” .
So what 's to be done ?
While it might feel good to hate these people and/or convince them to hate themselves for hoarding all those dreams , that 's not ultimately going to solve anything . While it 's never a bad idea to have an awareness of the role one 's background played in one 's own success – “ checking your privilege ” , in the parlance of the internet – that alone is not going to fix inequality .
Rampant inequality is not the fault of a class of people doing exactly what anyone would do in their position , but a political and economic system that incentivizes and enables them to do so . ( Do n't hate the player , hate the game . ) It follows that the solution is not individual and moralistic , but collective and political .
All over the world , social democratic movements are gaining popularity and power on the strength of ideas meant to reduce inequality and stimulate the economy : increased inheritance tax , maximum wage , taxes on the wealthy , and increased spending on the programs people need to not just survive , but thrive .
Another important element is unionism : when workers assert their power , wages rise along with purchasing power and general feelings of satisfaction . An even more exciting solution is on offer in the UK , which votes on Thursday , where the Labour party wants to democratize the economy by empowering workers to direct the fruits of their labor . Worker-owned cooperatives , re-nationalization and other forms of public , community-oriented ownership all have roles to play .
If the upper middle class wants to go beyond checking their privilege to actually relinquishing some of it , they can support these movements . Only then can they live down Reeves ' ignominious moniker , and only then will there be a more equitable distribution of dreams .
( Part 2 in a 4-Part Series on Elemental Art Featuring Natural Wonders of the World )
We all know that the Earth 's surface is covered mostly in water and ice , but what is truly astonishing is how many forms this amazing life-giving element can take . From stunning glaciers and roaring waterfalls as high as a skyscraper to jagged mountainside beds of icy spikes as tall as a man , the myriad beautiful water formations and phenomena found on our planet rival the aesthetic power of human art . Here are 15 ice , glaciers , fjords , waterfalls , unusual lakes , and other stunning examples of nature 's finest water and ice art .
Frozen Water : Small-Scale Ice Formations
Whether on a massive scale or smaller than the tip of your finger , from icicles to ice stars , the planet 's many ice formations like its bizarre and amazing land phenomena are truly as varied as snowflakes .
From the snowflake to the icicle , few things on earth are as gorgeous as frozen formations . Ice ribbons are perhaps one of the most intriguing of ice formations , seemingly resembling frosting squeezed from a baker 's press . Here you see icicles , ribbons , a rare ice star , ice columns and encased grass . The odd picture is certainly a curiosity – how did it form ?

This peak in Valle Frances is studded with distinct ice formations that resemble large boulders . Wind and fluctuating temperatures create unusual ice shapes in this famous national park called the Torres del Paine ( it 's an eco-tourism hot spot ) .
Ice Shelves

The photographer caught this fascinating ice formation shot in Huseby , Sweden . Ice takes on all sorts of interesting asymmetrical and geometric shapes , from the icy platelets above to the incredible parallel ice shelves of the Arctic . Ellesmere Island is famous for its ice shelves , but unfortunately they are diminishing rapidly in the face of global warming . Climate change caused alarming losses in summer of 2008 , and scientists are concerned that this special ecosystem may soon be lost forever .
Ice Caves

Hard to believe , but those luscious sculptured waves are completely natural – and on the ceiling . A cave in Bavaria , Germany features this unusual ice . Ice caves are common throughout the world , but some of the largest are the massive , twisting Eisriesenwelt Caves in Austria ( shown above right ) .
More Aging Americans Leaving US
There are now a record 47 million Americans without health insurance , while the percentage of children without insurance rose for a second consecutive year , according to newly released US Census Bureau data . Medical tourism , in order to obtain affordable health care , is beginning to be a necessary option for some as US citizens go to Cuba for medical procedures , Canada and Mexico for medicine and to Mexico for elder care .
More Aging Americans Leaving US
As the economy crashes in on many older Americans and their savings , more and more are looking to Mexico for the solution to their assisted living needs . With 75 million baby boomers heading toward retirement and the cost of private nursing care in the US greatly outstripping retirement funds , Mexican developers say they have an irresistible product in the works : active senior and assisted living facilities in a warm climate full of friendly people for as little as $ 1,100 USD a month . The monthly charge also includes food , housekeeping and personal assistance . In the US , such facilities usually cost from 3-5,000 USD per month .
The drug cartel violence that gets so much corporate media coverage rarely touches civilians . Mexico is as safe as or safer than the US . Many Americans will come perhaps not because they want to , but out of necessity and will find Mexico far more modern and far safer than they had imagined .
One retiree in Mexico reported that they have satellite television in their facility , so they do n't miss any American news or programs . When they want to see a movie or go shopping downtown , the taxi ride is only $ 2- $ 3 to Guadalajara , a culturally rich city of 4 million people , just 30 miles away
There are up to 50 Mexican cities and towns that are ideal for assisted living facilities aimed at the US and Canadian markets and the timing for the development of these facilities is just right as the baby boomer generation is entering retirement age . One thing that operators of the new facilities call a major selling point is not just the price , but the Mexican-style care that comes with a society used to caring for their parents and grandparents throughout their lives .
One problem , according to some health care lobbyists , is a lack of regulations . The private assisted living and nursing industry is so new in Mexico – there are about a half dozen facilities under construction – that laws need to be written to cover their activities . However , the Mexican Association of Retirement Communities is lobbying for legislation similar to that in the US .
Mexico has a national health care system ( which Americans can buy into for only $ 350 a year ) along with many private hospitals and clinics with US trained doctors . Average life expectancy for Mexicans is 75 years , just three less than in the US , according to the retirement organization AARP ( American Association of Retired Persons ) .
Since most Mexicans take care of their parents until death , there has not been much of a nursing home industry at all , except for those run by charities or the government . It is shameful that in the US many have no health care at all and can not afford assisted living services . Taxpayer money is a shame to waste on wars and other foreign adventures . The society has also not progressed to the point where Americans take care of their aging parents .

The Bank , however , risks running straight into another row , because the most practical alternative to animal fat , it says , is palm oil – and that is likely to spark protests from environmentalists unless it can be sustainably sourced .
Revelations last year that the new plastic £5 note contained animal-derived additives sparked anger and boycotts , and the Bank has now launched a consultation to gauge public opinion over what materials to use for the next £20 note and future reprints of the £5 and £10 notes .
It decided earlier this year not to withdraw plastic £5 banknotes from circulation and said it would push ahead with production of the new £10 polymer note featuring Jane Austen , which is to be issued in September .
But the Bank has postponed signing a contract for the production of the plastic £20 note , which is to be issued by 2020 . It has been working with De La Rue and Innovia Security , the potential suppliers of the polymer material that would be used for future banknotes , to assess alternative options to animal-based products , such as palm or coconut oil . The Bank also commissioned a report on the environmental impact of a range of additives from a consultancy firm , Efeca .
The Guardian reports that On Thursday , Threadneedle Street revealed that De La Rue and Innovia had concluded that “ the only practical alternative to animal-derived additives ” were “ additives derived from palm oil ” and that that was “ consistent with advice received from Efeca ” .
It wants a decision on new £20 notes by the summer and has called for people to give their views by 12 May .
“ The Bank will reflect upon the various religious , ethical and environmental considerations raised by the inclusion of animal-derived additives and palm oil as the alternative , ” it said , adding that it was conscious of the potential environmental costs of using palm oil . According to Efeca , it is the fourth worst agricultural product in terms of impact on global deforestation , with 8 % of that between 1990 and 2008 resulting from palm oil production .
In a report published on Thursday alongside its call for public views , the Bank said it had consulted WWF on using palm oil . It was told by the conservation charity that because the palm oil crop is the most efficient source of vegetable oils , “ it could be the least environmentally damaging source when produced sustainably ” .
“ However , non-sustainable production of palm oil ( and other vegetable-based oil crops ) can lead to destruction of forests , with significant negative impacts on wildlife , as well as on the local indigenous human populations , ” the Bank 's report added .
Time for weighing up the evidence and public views is tight , because the launch of a new note can take more than four years .
“ Whether or not to use polymer substrate produced using animal-derived additives in the new £20 polymer note is therefore an urgent decision that must be taken in summer 2017 ahead of planned pre-production trials , ” the Bank noted .
WWF said it was encouraged to see the “ thorough and extensive ” review in response to the animal fat issues , but it urged the Bank to proceed carefully if it moved to palm oil . “ Palm oil has benefits as it produces more oil per land area than any other equivalent oil crop , ” said Emma Keller , the agriculture commodities manager at WWF .
“ Worldwide demand is expected to double again by 2050 , but this expansion comes at the expense of human rights and tropical forest – which forms critical habitat for a large number of endangered wildlife [ species ] – unless it is sustainable . People do n't want the banknotes in their pocket to come with such a high environmental cost . The Bank must only source RSPO ( Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil ) -certified sustainable palm oil or none at all . ”
There was also a tentative welcome for the Bank 's consultation from the Vegan Society , which campaigns for manufacturers to use plant-based products in place of animal-derived ingredients such as tallow , an animal byproduct of beef or mutton fat found in the £5 notes .
“ While we welcome the replacement of tallow , we encourage the Bank of England to ensure that any oils used are sourced sustainably , ” it said .
Doug Maw , who started the petition to remove animal products from banknotes , urged people to contribute to the Bank 's consultation and expressed concern about the possible use of palm oil .
“ During my meeting with the chief cashier , I pointed out that , of the numerous plant-based alternatives available , palm oil or coconut oil from non-sustainable sources are also unacceptable for ethical reasons , ” they said .
“ Palm production has brought the orangutang to the brink of extinction and coconuts are often harvested in a very exploitative way . I want them to consider ethical issues in all decision-making processes to avoid this kind of thing recurring . ”

Lourn Eidal , assistant art director , Crystal Peak Design : “ I found a stock picture of a woman wearing roughly what I thought would be the right clothes for the character , and it had the right attitude . But I changed some of the details . I believe there were some white stripes on the bodice that I removed because it seemed too sporty . There was a necktie or bow tie that made it look like not real S-and-M . I put a different face on there with an intense , in-control look . It was some model 's head . I found an image of a guy on a couch , but their head was in the cushions so I put a different head on , so you could see they were looking back at them The image has a bit of shock factor , especially where we are , which is a conservative part of the country . But I hope it 's not too vulgar or over the top . ”
Everywhere I go , I am asked about my bike setup . I have used Mosko Moto luggage for almost 2 years now , and always had a great experience . Soft luggage is much more adaptable to different applications , wo n't break your ankle , and is less likely to be damaged after contacting things like the ground , trees , or your buddy 's bike .
My current `` main '' luggage is the Reckless 40L System V2.0 . A very sturdy harness , that houses 3 separate , removable dry bags . Fully waterproof , adaptable , easy to access each compartment , tough enough to survive any adventure , and expandable with other luggage , such as chairs , tent bags , sleeping pads , or smaller Mosko Moto luggage accessories . This system was designed and engineered over many years through rider input , and fits my bike ( and my travels ) like a glove . I love the way it looks on the 500 .
The tank bag I am currently using is the very recently released Nomad Tank Bag . There is absolutely no other tank bag on the market like this one . Everything is compartmentalized , adapts in shape depending on what is loaded in it , is customizable with a MOLLE panel on top , and includes a hydration bladder , map pocket , and deployable rain cover .
I keep all of my tools in the Fatty Tool Roll , a setup that is VERY sturdy , and set up to organize my tools better than any other tool pouch I 've tried before . One of the key differences of this one to others , is that it comes with it 's own rain pouch . The `` belt '' makes it easy to keep it closed , and the loop is a handy way to attach it to parts of your luggage and bike . It even has a whiskey drink recipe inside , but you 'll have to get one yourself to find out how to make it .
To protect myself from the elements , I chose to ride in the new KLiM Dakar setup . The jersey is mesh , but the toughest mesh I 've ever felt . Very strange , but cool . Ventilation is important , and the pants do the job well , also . Comfortable enough I did n't really notice the gear , which is a great sign . I paired it with a Forecast setup and base layers in case of inclement weather . I chose to wear dirt gear over adventure gear , because it 's difficult to be comfortable in something so constrictive and hot . May not have been the safest choice , but it was the most comfortable one .
The KLiM Arsenal Vest made it easy to carry things on me for easy access , and to have hydration ready at all times .
I have been wearing the same pair of boots for almost two years . They are n't the safest or sturdiest boot , but they waterproof and very comfortable . I used to not bring shoes on trips , and just wear these MSR Dual Sport boots the entire weekend . The gummy sole on the bottom is great for gripping the pegs , even when it 's raining .
A lawsuit filed Friday by a Baylor graduate claims 31 players committed 52 acts of rape during a four-year span , including two that raped them in 2013 .
The woman alleges that former Bears players Tre'Von Armstead and Shamycheal Chatman raped them following a party on April 18 , 2013 , according to Sarah Mervosh of The Dallas News .
Both players were named as suspects by police in an investigation regarding that rape , however , neither were charged .
Lawyers in the suit identified at least 52 `` acts of rape '' by 31 players from 2011-14 , with two of the incidents classified as gang rapes committed by 10 or more players at once .
The lawsuit details a culture of sexual violence inside the Baylor athletic program , and has a Dallas-area high school athlete claiming former assistant Kendal Briles once said , `` Do you like white women ? Because we have a lot of them at Baylor and they love football players . ''
According to the lawsuit , Chatman was accused of rape before the incident involving the plaintiff , after a student athletic trainer reported they had raped them at their apartment . Baylor reportedly moved that trainer to a female sports team and agreed to pay for the remainder of their education , provided they sign a non-disclosure agreement .
The numbers presented in the suit are in stark contrast to those posted by Baylor after an independent investigation by the Pepper Hamilton Law firm in 2016 . Regents told the Wall Street Journal in October that 17 women reported sexual or domestic assaults by 19 players during the same time span .
Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum Part of the harmonica and bell set carried by astronauts Walter `` Wally '' Schirra and Tom Stafford aboard Gemini VI in December 1965 .
Long associated with wintry Christmas cheer , “ Jingle Bells ” was originally written for a Thanksgiving celebration .
In 1857 , James Lord Pierpont , an organist at a Unitarian church in Savannah , Georgia , published the music and lyrics to a song they had written , “ The One Horse Open Sleigh. ” The song was first performed during a Thanksgiving concert at the church—but many maintain that it was written as early as 1850 , when Pierpont lived in the village of Medford , Massachusetts . ( In fact , a longstanding , and rather civil war , has been waged between these two towns over the “ real ” birthplace of the song . )
The song was re-published in 1857 and was given the title we all know today . Neither version made any impression on the public—it took several generations for “ Jingle Bells ” to become a holiday favorite .
BONUS FACTOID : “ Jingle Bells ” holds the distinction of being the first song broadcast from space . On December 16 , 1965 , the crew of Gemini 6 reported seeing a “ red-suited ” astronaut ( in “ polar orbit ” ) before serenading Mission Control with a spirited ( and charmingly tuneless ) performance with bells and a harmonica they smuggled onboard their spacecraft .

Introduction
Qtractor can handle your MIDI and Audio tracks with sample-perfect precision , present you with a state of the art , industry standard mixer , complete with complex routing and effects , and allow you to record , mix and master your song all the way to the final bounce to a standard stereo recording tool . But this is not what we are going to do today .
Today , we are just going to get our feet wet . At the end of this session , you should have a drum track , that you can duplicate to create any other MIDI track , and an audio track , that , using the same technique , you can use to record any other audio source . Then we will move around the Qtractor timeline , play , pause , loop , setup some preferences , and export our work out to the joyful , honest and downright wonderful world of show business .
The DAW epitome
Up until recently , Rui Nuno Capela , the creator and main author of Qtractor , did not want to call it a DAW . Indeed , where almost every other similar tool end up encompassing every aspect of the audio & MIDI recording process , doing everything in-house from take to bounce , Qtractor takes the `` one task , one tool '' approach and , whenever possible , avoids doing what other tools can do better . As such , it fits perfectly into the GNU/Linux audio ecosystem . It ( re ) uses standard display widgets to provide a familiar and light user interface , as opposed to everyone else developping their own GUI paradigms . Big functions , like audio sample time-stretching , are handled by external libraries , elegantly integrated into a streamlined sequencer .
I personally have no problem calling Qtractor – that I 've been using for almost a decade now – a DAW , and a great one at that .
Things we 'll need
- Qtractor - obviously
- QJackCtl - optional - to setup JACK
- Calf Studio Gear - to get some instrument and effect plugins
- Audacity - to mix our song down to one big fat stereo PCM file
- The fluid-soundfont-gm free sound font bank - A ( big ) free soundfont - for our drum track , the bedrock of our song .
Those packages are more than probably already available in your GNU/Linux system , and installable though the specific package managing system it uses . However , if you are using a Debian-based system ( come to think of it , you probably are ) LMP warmly recommends the famous KXStudio repository , where you will find said software in their latest stable state .
Either way , to install all of it in a single command , just enter
apt install qtractor qjackctl calf-plugins audacity fluid-soundfont-gm
And you got yourself a studio , that will update automatically . Is n't grass greener on this side of the fence ? ; )
Let 's track some cues
Click the Qtractor icon , a wonderful `` studio control cockpit '' is hidden behind . Now quickly , before inspiration is gone , create your first track : Right-click in the empty left column , and choose `` Add Track '' or hit Ctrl+T .
In the resulting dialog , choose MIDI
Name your track `` drums '' and keep the number of the MIDI channel somewhere in your head ( you can alway see it by double-clicking the track name anytime ) and close the dialog .
Now open the mixer ( F9 ) and right-click the plugin area , right below the name of the track . Select the `` add plugin '' menu entry .
In the plugin selection dialog , start to type `` fluid '' in the search field and BAM here it is : The Calf fluidsynth plugin .
Click on the file selector button labeled `` soundfont '' and navigate to /usr/share/sounds/sf2/FluidR3_GM.sf2 ; Pump the volume up to the max : 0db . Loud is good .
Click on the first selector ( if the current track has MIDI channel 2 - double-click on the track name to check that - then that selector would be the second one ) in the area labeled `` channels '' and descend aaall the way down where the drum kits are ; The first is called `` Standard '' use this one for now .
Close the plugin window . To access it again , double-click on its name in the plugin area of the track , in the mixer window . Select your track , and hit C ( or use the menu entry Clip/new ) to access the MIDI clip editor and ... Oops , ah yes , do n't forget to properly name your project , and keep it in a separate folder .
Sessions
A Qtractor session is , at a more technical level , an XML file , perfectly readable and editable , with relative pointers to separate MIDI and audio clip files .
Qtractor now needs to know where you want to keep those 3 things . Hence the rather imperative `` Save that session NOW '' dialog . Keep your session directory clean : When you drag & drop an odd external sample or MIDI file , first copy it inside to keep things self-contained . Now you can move your session around rigs by just copying this session directory .
The MIDI tracks
Ok , now our project lives in a cosy directory of his . Where were we ... Yes , create MIDI notes . At this point , you can either create a new MIDI clip and enter notes with you mouse in the clip editor , or record new notes on the fly using your MIDI keyboard . Let 's cover both methods .
The clip editor
To create a new clip , select your track , and hit C ( or use the menu entry Clip/new ) . To edit an existing clip , just double-click on it .
Click on the pianoroll notes to hear the sounds - the drum instruments are located between C1 and C6 ;
Select your resolution by choosing `` beat '' in the upper-right unlabeled `` note '' menu in the button bar ;
Select the `` pencil '' note entering tool in the button bar ;
Enter notes by clicking in the clip pattern grid
Select the `` pointer move '' note moving tool in the button bar to move existing notes .
Just click on a note to move it . At the bottom of the MIDI clip window , you can select the velocity of the notes . You can also access more MIDI parameters but theirs is beyond the scope of this tutorial .
Recording live MIDI
Connect your Keyboard : Click on the red `` Connections '' icon at the top of the main toobar ; Then locate your keyboard ( s ) and other MIDI control devices in the left pane , and connect them in the right pane to Qtractor `` master '' MIDI input by right-clicking on the names and choosing `` connect '' . Then save your session , and those connections now belong to it .
Tip : Connect all your peripherals once for good in a template.qtt file that will load at each subsequent new session , and set it in the options dialog .
On the MIDI track you want to record , either in the timeline or in the mixer window , arm the track by pressing the first `` R '' button . Then in the main button bar , engage the red record button .
The RECORD buttons are now both engaged .
Now click on the blue `` Play '' arrow button ( or hit space ) and hit your MIDI keyboard .
The MIDI clip being created is red ; Right-click on you newly created MIDI clip , and select the `` Clip/Loop set '' menu entry . Engage the loop button in the main toolbar , hiy play , Now your clip is looping .
That 's it for MIDI tracks , now you can create another one , but this time insert another plugin , such as the Calf Organ ( you installed it earlier ) and you now know how to enter notes in it .
The AUDIO tracks
Pluggin it in
Ok , so now , connect an instrument to you audio interface . A mic , a guitar , whatever . Then open the Connections window again , this time head to the Audio tab . Open the `` system '' node in the left pane : That 's your audio card . Select one `` capture '' item , and connect it to both left and right `` Master '' Qtractor inputs in the right pane .
Recording audio
Now create an audio track , and select it . This is very important : If you want to hear something on any ( MIDI or audio ) track , it has to be selected . This is the default behaviour , and can be changed to manually monitor tracks , but again , this is above your paygrade . At this point the Vu-meters of both the master input bus and the track should move when you play or sing . Adjust the volume , then engage both track and main red record buttons . Now click on the `` Play '' blue arrow button ( or hit space ) and play some music . And please , remember , we humans tend to get bored if we ca n't dance to music once in a while .
That 's it for audio tracks , now you can create another one , just remember to setup the connections in the asupervisorstioned window .
And that 's it about creating tracks ! You will see that Qtractor , while being very powerful , does n't get in the way and lets you do things quite simply . If only the mixer could be embedded just as the messages window is , or - even better yet - just the selected strip as in Ardour , allowing for a live-oriented `` one-window '' paradigm , that would be soo wonderful , wait , am I talking ?
Living in the timeline
Shift+click in the ruler to position the playhead . Works in the thumbnail view , too ; Now ;
Open the shortcuts window by using the `` Help/Shortcuts '' menu entry . There , you will find the commands to
Navigate between the 3 markers ;
Play , pause , record , etc . ;
Mute/Solo/Arm the track for recording
Set the beat resolution
Quantize , Randomize , Do stuff to your clips
A lot of other functions that you need at your fingertips
Navigation
Click in the timeline `` ruler '' to position the left marker . Right-click to position the right marker . Now use the `` Backward '' and `` Forward '' buttons to `` snap '' the playhead ( the red line ) to either
The start of the song ;
the left marker ;
the right marker ;
the end of the song .
This is how one moves in the Qtractor timeline , and in both MIDI and audio clip editors . And now you know why it is useful to know the keyboard shortcut for `` backwards '' and `` forward '' .
Tip : Shift-click anywhere in the timeline to position the playhead .
Here , the playhead is at the start of the song .
The clip selection modes
In the edit menu , you will find the four modes of selection :
Clip : You select a clip ( multi-select works , Ctrl and Shift act as usual ) to move it around
Range : You just drag the mouse to select an entire range across all the tracks
Rectangle : A combination of the two previous modes
Automation : When you click on a clip , it creates a control node for the selected automation curve .
If Qtractor starts to behave unpredictably , you may have accidentally changed selection modes , so watch out for this .
Tip : To select a range ( in any mode ) just hit Ctrl+R and it will select everything between the left and right markers .
In practice , you 'll only use Clip and Automation modes , so either learn their respective keyboard shortcuts , or set you own .
The export
That 's it ! You now know how to create and edit MIDI and audio tracks . Once your song is done , launch Audacity , select JACK as the audio system , then Qtractor as the source , hit record . Then back to Qtractor , hit play . This is how it 's done , by the way . That is how professional audio engineers mix down a song at the end of the mixing process .
Mastering
You can insert a mastering effects chain ( such as the excellent Calf plugin suite ) on either
Qtractor `` Master out '' bus
Between Qtractor and audacity ( using the phabulous JAMin )
Or any other mastering combination that I 'm not sure I even want to think about
Conclusion
Qtractor is a wonderful production tool , that really shines after a few weeks of using and tweaking . If you want to see a particular Qtractor feature covered on LMP , just say it in the comments , otherwise just say hi , it 's much appreciated !

The statue outside Upton Park celebrating West Ham 's 1966 World Cup heroes was defaced on Saturday night hours after the east London club 's 2-1 victory against Chelsea .
A litre of blue paint was tipped over the base of the statue that pays tribute to the collective achievement of Bobby Moore , Martin Peters and Sir Geoff Hurst , who helped the Three Lions to win their solitary major international trophy .
The sculpture also features former Everton player Ray Wilson , who carried England and Hammers skipper Moore as they paraded the Jules Rimet Trophy around the Wembley pitch after the memorable 4-2 win over West Germany .
Newham Council , who commissioned the statue with the club in 2003 , confirmed that a cleaning team had been sent to repair the damage .
`` We were alerted on Sunday evening that blue paint had been poured on the plinth of the Champions statue and sent a specialist cleansing team as soon as possible to clear it up .
`` Around a litre of blue emulsion paint had been poured on the plinth behind the statue and it took the team around 45 minutes to fully remove it using a high pressure jet washer , '' read a council statement .
The statue , which cost £725,000 to erect and stands on the corner of Green Street and Barking Road , has been damaged on three occasions in recent years .
The ongoing mystery surrounding the tragic story of Kendrick Johnson led me to wonder whether there is a geographic trend in the ratio of accidental deaths to homicides . Obviously , some states will have higher homicide rates , especially those with large cities . But how does the injury-related accidental-death rate vary ? And is the ratio of accidents to homicides controlled solely by population density ?
This graphic shows that the ratio is not strongly controlled by population ; while less populous states tend to have higher accident to homicide ratios , when I plot population against the ratio on a state-by-state basis , the Pearson coefficient is only 0.15 . This suggests there are other factors at play , which is clear just from looking at the accident rate distribution in the graph . What those factors are is beyond the scope of the graphic , but it would be interesting to find a way to determine whether some cities are significantly more likely to rule a death an accident rather than homicide . To do that , we 'd need to compare rulings against actual cause of death , and those data do n't exist . Regardless , the graphic shows some interesting trends . The one relevant to the Kendrick Johnson story is that Georgia , at 3.8 nontransport accidental deaths per homicide , is significantly below the national average of 5.3 .

Ahead of their final season at Ohio State , J.T . Barrett sat down with Yahoo Sports ' Pete Thamel to talk about their roller coaster career . Here , in their own words , is what their experience has been like .
This is my fifth year at Ohio State , and heading into my final season I 'm getting a little bit nostalgic . There 's always been a part of me that enjoys when things get difficult : the dirty , nasty grind of it all . This year , I 'm embracing it to a new level and bringing all the guys along with me . And when teammates tease me about how long I 've been here , they 're right about one thing : I 've practically seen it all .
Scroll to continue with content Ad
The best word to describe my path here is unique . Some people start at the bottom and skyrocket to the top . Some start at the top and tumble to the bottom . Mine , well , it has been like a roller coaster with the highs and lows .
I began coming in hot , getting thrust into the starting role in 2014 after Braxton Miller got hurt . We lost to Virginia Tech at home in the second game , but Coach ( Urban ) Meyer never lost faith in me . We huddled up and figured out how to fix it . Then we get on a roll and went undefeated the rest of the way , but I broke my ankle against Michigan in the last game of the regular season . After we won the national title game against Oregon , someone asked me : “ Was the victory bittersweet because I did n't play in it ? ” Heck no ! I was so much a part of that team and poured my heart into it that part of me was out on the field that night .
Story continues
Then in 2015 , I did n't win the starting job right away . We had a loaded team that year , and everyday at camp we had all these NFL scouts there . It was like every practice was the Ohio State Pro Day . That summer in camp , I pressed and really did n't practice well . When I ended up being named the starter later that year , I had a DUI/OVI and then had to regain the trust of all my teammates .
In 2016 , we had a strong season going 11-1 and reached the College Football Playoff . But it did n't finish the way that we wanted to , as we got shut out by Clemson , 31-0 , and experienced another low point . That loss sets up a final season where the seniors in the program and myself are aiming to have another strong regular season and rewrite the ending .
I know that when I 've been challenged in my career , my heart beats a little harder and I tighten my chinstrap a little tighter . I know that 's one thing that 's helped me earn Coach Meyer 's trust . When I got here , I was overweight because I had a torn ACL from high school . They used to tease me about my weight and challenged me early in my career when I was n't very good . What makes them a great coach is that they have a unique way to get the best out of people . He 's not going to tell you what you want to hear . He 's going to be honest with you . And I 've learned that their honesty can be blunt sometimes , and you may not always like it as a player . But that 's also what makes them so good because it 's direct and there 's no confusion around what they want . Coach Meyer kept pushing me and never gave up on me , and I really appreciate that now .
There 's been a lot of changes since the Clemson game . We have new offensive coordinators , Kevin Wilson and Ryan Day . Coach Wilson ran an up-tempo offense at Indiana and Coach Day is a disciple of Chip Kelly and the Oregon offense .
Ohio State quarterback J.T . Barrett runs a drill during an NCAA college football practice in Columbus , Ohio . ( AP )
Basically , with our new coordinators , all they know is fast . There will still be times when we play slow this year , but our regular operation is just faster than it 's ever been here . At times last year , we were really stressed as an offense . We would win games and there would just be relief of winning , and it was kind of like that in 2015 too . I do n't think we operate like that anymore . We get excited on big plays and score touchdowns and everyone is running to the ball . Not that we did n't do that , but at the end of the day everyone is just striving to be their best and playing more relaxed .
Coach Day is my third different quarterback coach , and I feel like they and I have really connected . He 's had me over to their house a couple times , and their 9-year-old son , RJ , is the funniest kid in the world . We 've done things like hit golf balls , and Coach Day is quick to remind everybody that I 'm not headed for the PGA Tour . What Coach Day has done is really teach me a lot about football , as they came here from coaching quarterbacks with the 49ers and the Eagles . I feel like our timing is better in the pass game , and we 've done some different things like meeting with receivers to get on the same page . They always say : “ When you think you have it figured out , that 's when you slip up . There 's always something you can learn . ”
Even with all the success I 've had , I know there are skeptics out there . Even some of our fans might feel like I 'm not the best option at quarterback , but I 'm just going to try and focus on the task at hand . That 's getting us better as a team . The harder I work here and the more team success we have , the better chance I have to position myself for the NFL .
It 's hard for me to talk about my individual legacy at Ohio State , as I 've always been focused on the team . To finish my career , I think it would be really cool to win a national championship and for me to play in the title game . When I wrote down my goals at the start of my career at Ohio State , I never mentioned winning the Heisman Trophy or the Davey O'Brien Award for the best quarterback . I never cared about individual awards because I knew that those would come if the team was successful .
Years from now , if people do talk about me or my legacy , I hope people remember me both as a winner and a good dude who cared about people and never wanted to be big time . To me , I 'm still J.T . Barrett from Wichita Falls , Texas , who likes to stay home and play video games and eat Honey Buns . That 's who I am , and I 'm not going get away from it . My stay here has been unique , and to finish it leading this team to the national title would be the perfect ending to a memorable journey .

The rapid expansion of renewable technologies is one of the few bright spots in an otherwise bleak assessment of global progress towards low-carbon energy , the International Energy Agency ( IEA ) said in an annual report to the Clean Energy Ministerial ( CEM ) here today .
“ The drive to clean up the world 's energy system has stalled , ” IEA Executive Director Maria van der Hoeven told the CEM , which brings together ministers representing countries responsible for four-fifths of global greenhouse-gas emissions . “ Despite much talk by world leaders , and despite a boom in renewable energy over the last decade , the average unit of energy produced today is basically as dirty as it was 20 years ago . ”
To illustrate this inertia , the report , Tracking Clean Energy Progress , introduces the Energy Sector Carbon Intensity Index ( ESCII ) , which shows how much carbon dioxide is emitted , on average , to provide a given unit of energy . The ESCII stood at 2.39 tonnes of CO 2 per tonne of oil equivalent ( tCO 2 /toe ) in 1990 , and had barely moved by 2010 , holding at 2.37 tCO 2 /toe ( see data visualisations ) .
“ As world temperatures creep higher due to ever-increasing emissions of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide – two thirds of which come from the energy sector – the overall lack of progress should serve as a wake-up call , ” Ms. Van der Hoeven said . “ We can not afford another 20 years of listlessness . We need a rapid expansion in low-carbon energy technologies if we are to avoid a potentially catastrophic warming of the planet , but we must also accelerate the shift away from dirtier fossil fuels . ”
While noting that progress remains alarmingly slow for a majority of technologies that could save energy and reduce carbon dioxide emissions consistent with international climate goals , the IEA 's reportdid find some recent , positive signs .
From 2011 to 2012 , solar photovoltaic and wind technologies grew by an impressive 42 % and 19 % , respectively , despite ongoing economic and policy turbulence in the sector . Emerging economies are also stepping up efforts in clean energy . Brazil , China and India were among the countries that enhanced policy support for the renewable electricity sector in 2012 , for example . Advanced vehicle technologies also progressed well , with hybrid-electric vehicles breaking the 1 million annual sales mark . Electric vehicle sales also more than doubled to reach 110 000 vehicles .
Ms. Van der Hoeven emphasised the ongoing , significant potential of energy efficiency measures . They noted that while there has been progress in improving the fuel economy of passenger vehicles , a wide difference in standards among countries remains , and very few regions currently have comprehensive fuel economy measures in place .
The revolution in shale gas technology has triggered a switch to gas from coal in the United States – important to reducing emissions in the short term – but this is still a regional phenomenon . Coal use expanded elsewhere , particularly in Europe , where coal 's share of the power generation mix increased at the expense of natural gas .
In a world that continues to rely heavily on fossil fuels , carbon capture and storage ( CCS ) deployment is ever more critical . While CCS technologies are mature in many applications , the report stresses that they are unlikely to be deployed commercially until governments make a strong commitment in the form of appropriate policy .
The report gives policy recommendations , technology by technology . At the highest level , it stresses that the true cost of energy must be reflected in consumer prices , through carbon pricing and the phase-out of fossil-fuel subsidies . Technologies like electric vehicles , wind and solar will need support for several years more , but policies should be flexible and transparent . More stringent and broader energy performance standards , building codes and fuel economy standards can drive energy efficiency .
“ The CEM governments represent 4.1 billion people and three-quarters of global GDP , ” Ms. Van der Hoeven said . “ Together , they have the power to set the clean energy transition in motion , and now it is time for them to use it . ”

About the IEA
The International Energy Agency is an autonomous organisation which works to ensure reliable , affordable and clean energy for its 28 member countries and beyond . Founded in response to the 1973/4 oil crisis , the IEA 's initial role was to help countries co-ordinate a collective response to major disruptions in oil supply through the release of emergency oil stocks to the markets . While this continues to be a key aspect of its work , the IEA has evolved and expanded . It is at the heart of global dialogue on energy , providing reliable and unbiased research , statistics , analysis and recommendations .
This was my first year participating in RedditGifts Secret Santa and I was super excited . I honestly was n't expecting anything exciting because nothing really exciting usually happens to me ( which , honestly , I 'm happy with ) .
Imagine my delight when the very same day that I receive an e-mail saying that my SS has shipped my gift , I get a package from Amazon ! !

Thank you sososo much to my Secret Santa . You 've started off my Christmas season with lots of happiness . : )
Meet the 2013 SXSW Filmmakers # 4 : Vincent Grashaw Uncovers the Issues of Juvenile Rehabilitation in 'Coldwater '
“ Coldwater , ” directed and co-written by “ Bellflower ” producer Vincent Grashaw , follows the story of a teenage boy who is forcefully taken from their home and put into a reform facility in the middle of the wilderness . “ Coldwater ” shines the spotlight on the many pressing issues concerning juvenile rehabilitation in the United States .
What it 's about : A teenage boy is sent to a juvenile reform facility in the wilderness . As we learn about the tragic events that sent them there , their struggle becomes one for survival with the inmates , the counselors , and with the retired war colonel in charge .
What was your biggest challenge in bringing “ Coldwater ” to the screen ? Getting someone to commit to funding the film was the biggest challenge – as it always is when it comes to making movies . I started writing the script at 18 years old in 1999 . Over these years , it was almost made several times , with name actors , larger budgets , but always seemed to fall apart… I feel as if I went through a decade lesson of learning what the industry is all about during this time and changed quite a bit as a filmmaker . Persistence was always very important . In the end , everything came together the way you always dream it would : Joe Bilotta , the executive producer , simply read the script and told me they wanted to do it .
What 's the film that most inspired you ? For “ Coldwater ” it was the reality of the subject matter which drove my research and development of the script . The social relevance had a heavy hand in my pursuit in bringing this film to light .
What would you like SXSW audiences to come away with after seeing your film ? I did n't want to make a film that was preachy on the reality of the subject matter . I want the film to stand on it 's own as a compelling story , but I definitely want the audience to come away with a larger awareness of the issues that exist in juvenile rehabilitation in the United States .
What do you have in the works ? I 'm aiming to direct my next feature in 2013 . I 'm currently involved in producing several projects with Coatwolf . My writing partner and I finally finished our next script which took us six years to complete… It 's a larger scale , black-and-white-period-piece-love-story during the golden-age of Hollywood , which I plan on producing down the road .
Indiewire invited SXSW directors to tell us about their films , including what inspired them , the challenges they faced and what they 're doing next . We 'll be publishing their responses leading up to the 2013 festival .

The sound that sparked a lockdown at a suburban Philadelphia military academy was most likely caused by bubble wrap being popped , and not gunfire , officials said .
A student who lives in an Eastern University apartment building located on the property of the Valley Forge Military Academy and College heard what they thought were shots fired Monday evening and called 911 , academy officials said in a statement .
Police from Radnor and Tredyffrin Townships responded , and the academy , Eastern University and nearby Cabrini University were all placed on lockdown while police searched the area .
They found no weapons or evidence of any weapon being fired at any time , and no one was injured , officials said .
`` Police report that one student indicated that the sound they heard could have been bubble wrap being popped , '' the academy posted on its Facebook page .
The lockdown was lifted about an hour and a half later , and the academy and the two universities resumed normal activities .
Eastern University officials said in a statement posted on Facebook that they 're `` thankful this event was not an actual gun related situation . ''
They also thanked the campus community for its patience , and said that the student `` took the correct action in calling 911 . ''
INJURED Bulldog Travis Cloke admits they feel sorry for Collingwood .
Cloke departed the Holden Centre at the end of last year after a turbulent season but said that the Magpies current on-field predicament was tough to watch .
Cloke said he 'd been in contact with Collingwood president Eddie McGuire and coach Nathan Buckley since their exit and believed they could guide the Magpies back to success .

Cloke said the move to Whitten Oval had been a good one but admitted they are n't thrilled when they saw their dad — AFL great David Cloke — criticise Collingwood and Buckley in The Herald Sun .
“ It 's been amazing . It 's been a great change , ” they said .
“ You go to a new club , they 've got different structures , different techniques , I 'm playing a different role .
“ Bevo 's a lover , he 's a hugger . Bucks is structured , they love the game , they live and breathes it .
“ It 's an unusual situation — dad is obviously a former great of the game — when they have comment , you 'd like to think they comment as a past player of the game .

Guess who 's back , back again . Brady 's back , tell a friend .
. @ UTCoachJones announces changes to Tennessee coaching staff https : //t.co/RBTmP6OXCF — Tennessee Football ( @ Vol_Football ) February 8 , 2017
In a statement , head coach Butch Jones said :
`` We are excited to welcome Brady and Laura Hoke to the football family . We feel extremely fortunate to get someone of Coach Hoke 's caliber that will continue to develop our defensive linemen while also providing expertise and experience to all of our players and coaching staff . They have an extensive track record of success as a head coach and on the defensive side of the ball . They will be a great fit to our entire organization . ''
Before you point and you laugh , Tennessee 's defense was No . 95 in the nation in total yards per game allowed and 104th in rushing yards per game allowed . The team was also 40th in the nation in sacks and that 's thanking in large part to having a pretty transcendent defensive end in Derek Barnett ( who had 13 of the team 's 30 total sacks ) . Defensive coordinator Bob Shoop is a good coordinator , but they do need some help .
Before arriving at Ball State as a head coach in 2003 , Hoke spent nearly the entirety of two decades as a defensive line coach in multiple stops . Despite all their issues as head coach at Michigan , they did have two top-10 recruiting classes roll through Ann Arbor during their tenure . The talent they left in the cupboard is evidenced clearly by how well the school did in the last two seasons under Jim Harbaugh .
There are some guys who are n't really cut out to be a head coach at the highest levels in the sport , and that might just be Hoke . It does n't mean they ca n't coach up a particular position group and flex their muscles on the recruiting trail .
This was an unexpectedly wild football game , one whose final result looked nothing like the contest 's beginning . It was another September game , and another woeful start for the Seahawks offense . The O-line looked lost as they tried to identify which of Tennessee 's front seven were rushing and which ones were n't , robbing the team of any chance to establish their game plan . Russell Wilson 's first 12 drop-backs included seven incompletions , a sack , two fumbles , and three completions for 22 yards- an infantile 1.8 yards per pass play . That , combined with a run game that averaged about a yard and a half per carry during the same period , led to punts on Seattle 's first seven possessions .
Part of that was poor blocking ( again ) , but a lot of it was an ( again ) skittish-looking Russell Wilson flat out missing open receivers ( again ) and not by small margins . I do n't know if it 's happy feet , or a carryover from last year when injuries forced them to rebuild their throwing motion with fewer legs and more shoulder . Whatever the reason , the iteration of Russell Wilson that played the first 10 quarters of this season was a far cry from the one who had the most successful first four years in NFL QB history .
The saving grace during Seattle 's parched slog through a barren offensive desert was their defense , who held Tennessee to a similar fate through the game 's first 20 minutes . Constant pressure and stuffy run defense kept the Titans ' offense at bay , limiting Marcus Mariota to two completions on their first nine attempts . Tennessee was , however , able to manufacture a couple of field goals and a 6-0 lead .
With time running down in the second quarter , it looked for all the world like Seattle would enter the half scoreless . However , seemingly out of nowhere , Wilson rediscovered their long ball , dropping diamonds down the chimney to a well-covered Doug Baldwin and a less-covered CJ Prosise on consecutive plays . Seattle 's first explosive plays in 186 games gave Wilson the chance to dart a ball inside the pylon to a diving Baldwin for the go-ahead score . It was a beautiful reminder of what this offense can be when Russ is in rhythm . Unfortunately , they scored with enough time for Mariota to complete 47 consecutive short passes and set up a Titans field goal as the clock expired and sending the home to the locker room with a two-point lead .
After a calm and mostly boring first half , the 3rd quarter got downright crazy . Wilson came out with their balls on fire , searing them into the palms of Baldwin , Paul Richardson , and even Jimmy Graham ( ! ) . They looked calm , confident , and controlled as Seattle chalked up chunks of yards . On the drive 's final play , they hit Chris Carson in stride over the middle , and CC rumbled into the endzone to give Seattle the lead back at 14-9 .
That 's when all of Tennessee 's offensive players put on their force fields and became physically impossible to tackle , apparently . Rishard Matthews got free on a short pass and then they just , I mean , they just kept running . Seattle had defenders all around them but they were n't able to touch them as they swerved down the field , careening 55 yards into the endzone after flooring three ‘ Hawks with a cut-back on the 10 yard-line . That gave the lead back to Tennessee , where it would reside for the remainder of the game .
After TDs on consecutive drives , Seattle went three-and-out . The Titans picked up right where they had left off , needing just five plays to go 54 yards , finishing the scoring drive by hitting a wide open tight end for a 24-yard walk-in TD . Seattle punted again , putting an exhausted defense back on the field . That 's when Demarco Murray ran off the left tackle , made a cut , and then followed an envoy of blockers 75 yards for the longest run against the Seahawks in the Pete Carroll era . I do n't think they were ever touched , and the Titans lead swelled to 16 .
Seattle , for their part , bounced back with yet another touchdown drive , as Wilson hit Luke Willson down the seam for a 27-yard score to keep the game on a tether . An unsuccessful slant to Paul Richardson on the two-point conversion kept the margin at 10 , a crucial difference than eight , especially given what happened next .
The Titans put together another long drive , this one fizzling in the red zone and leading to a field goal that made it 33-20 . Then , like a boxer who 's losing on every judge 's card but who refuses to give in , Wilson peeled the Seahawks offense off the mat once more and staggered forward , all jabs and looping uppercuts . Amazingly , they kept connecting , bringing the ‘ Hawks into the red zone again . Then , down 13 and with all 3 timeouts remaining , Wilson surveyed the defense and decided they needed to burn one . That 's fine- better to make sure things are in order and run a play you know you 'll execute .
Ahem .
Instead , the Seahawks unleashed a catastrophic series of events . On 2nd & 10 , coming out of the TO , there was a major breakdown up front and a defender came free up the middle . Wilson , unable to avoid the rush , backpedaled 12 yards in the center of the pocket before flinging the ball out of bounds . It resulted in an intentional grounding call and just like that , 2nd & 10 became 3rd & 27 . The next play , a 5-yard dump-off to Graham , set up 4th & 22 with 7:41 remaining . They should have kicked a field goal , gotten within 10 , and given themselves a chance to make a couple of stops .
Pete Carroll opted not to do that and instead of kicking , Seattle attempted a Hail Mary against eight DBs . To make matters worse , Seattle 's five blockers were unable to even slow up Tennessee 's three rushers , with one of them getting a clear shot on Wilson as they heaved up an unanswered prayer . The deficit remained 13 points , Seattle was down a timeout , and Tennessee milked away more clock before finally punting it back to the Seahawks .
Again the ‘ Hawks offense took the field and again they punched their way down the gridiron . With Baldwin on the bench nursing a groin strain , Tyler Lockett out with cramps , and an OL almost falling over from exhaustion , Wilson led their boys 72 yards in 12 plays , finding Richardson for a short score with just under two minutes to go and bringing the score to 33-27 . It was an incredible drive , all things considered , but cramps to an OL ( Rees Odhiambo ? ) with a running clock cost Seattle their second timeout- a development that ended up keeping the Seahawks from getting one more drive after stuffing three straight Titans runs . For as incredible as the offense was down the stretch , a few miscalculations along the way ended up keeping them from a shot to steal a miracle win .
SMOKE RINGS
* Russell Wilson overcame one of the worst starts of their life to absolutely pour it on in the second half . After only completing three of their first ten passes for 22 yards , Russ scorched their way to 26 on their final 39 for 351 yards and four TDs . It was nothing short of incredible and a major encouragement for an offense that had been pitiful up ‘ til then . Their 373 yards were a regular-season career high and the four TDs were stunning , especially since they never turned it over . If that Russell Wilson is here to stay , this team can still have a great season .
* Doug Baldwin open all day . Hell , he 's been open all season . 10 catches on 15 targets for 105 yards and the touchdown- numbers would be even more stratospheric had Russ not missed them three different times when they had separation . He 's been the best player on the team so far this season and if this offense ever does find a sustainable groove ( and assuming their injury is n't serious ) , their production is gon na be bananas .
* After entering the game with nine yards on ten targets , Jimmy Graham made an impact for the first time this season despite finishing the first half with one yard on three targets . They had a beastly reception early in the 3rd quarter , and eventually turned 11 targets into an impressive 7 catches for 72 yards . When Russ is feeling himself , everyone has room to eat . Hope this continues .
* The running game was a complete non-factor today , a bit of a disappointment after the way Chris Carson finished the game last week . Thomas Rawls and Eddie Lacy did n't sniff the ball today , with the team 's 15 designed runs being split between Carson ( 11 ) and Prosise ( 4 ) . Neither of them ever got going , with Carson turning their carries into 34 yards and Prosise netting just 9 . Their impacts were both felt in the passing game , however , as Carson had two catches for 18 yards and a score while Prosise spun their three catches into 65 . It may just be time for everyone to admit that this is a passing team now .
* The defense looked totally gassed by the end of the game , as evidenced by the litany of big plays and chain-moving runs they gave up in the second half . They ended up allowing 195 rushing yards at 5.6 per carry , shocking numbers against a team that has spent half a decade essentially leading the NFL in the fewest yards per carry . The lapses were individual and collective . Richard Sherman nearly lost their damn mind after being flagged ( dubiously ) on a Kam Chancellor interception , taking off their helmet and stalking the referee down the field . Shortly afterward , they tried to end Mariota 's life after he 'd been dragged out of bounds , earning yet another flag and nearly inciting a brawl . On the other side of the field , Jeremy Lane got worn out like a kid 's only pair of shoes . Kam Chancellor got wiped out by a few blocks , Earl Thomas looked out of position on a couple of the big plays , and their pursuit angles looked miscalculated at best . They never got a sack nor did they force a turnover . Just bizarre to watch them get carved up like that .
* 11 penalties for 98 yards . Good luck overcoming that .
For the third straight week , this team did not look like a Super Bowl contender . That 's the bar now , and just as the offense started to look up to the task , the defense completely regressed . One of these days , both units will collaborate and the result will be a very encouraging performance . Until then , we 're left hoping that this team will eke out close wins and that 's a very uncomfortable place to be .
Next up is a home game against the Colts on Sunday night . With any luck , it 'll be the palate cleanser this season so desperately needs . Onward , my friends , and upward .

White nationalist and neo-nazi groups have been present in the region of Eugene and Springfield for decades . However , in recent years they have become increasingly active and bold .
The community should be aware of this threat .
Locations in the Whiteaker neighborhood , which is traditionally a stronghold of anti-racist and environmental organizing , including the Earth Liberation Front , have been targeted recently by neo-nazi groups via tagging and spray painting slogans and symbols .
Much of this activity is likely related to Springfield residents Jimmy and Judy Marr , vehement white supremacists who are known for their vehicles that read “ diversity is a code word for white genocide ” and “ Trump : do the white thing. ” They are believed to reside at 1321 G Street in Springfield .
More information on these local and regional white supremacists can be found here .
Oregon has a deeply racist history that lives on today . Learn more here .
There are many community groups organizing against white supremacy . One that we recommend following , networking with , and supporting is the Rural Organizing Project . They have worked tirelessly on behalf of justice , human rights , and anti-racism across Oregon 's rural areas in concert with countless local groups . They have especially worked against “ patriot ” and militia groups , such as the groups that occupied the gold mine in southern Oregon and the groups behind the Bundy occupation of the Malhuer Wildlife Refuge . These groups are often are recruiting grounds and have relationships with white supremacist groups . Check out their excellent report on militia groups in Oregon here .
We at Deep Green Resistance abhor and condemn white supremacy in the strongest terms . We need to defeat white nationalists wherever they arise . This requires a wide range of methods , from internal work within our groups and communities to dismantling broader racist institutions to direct combat and self-defense against racist violence .
Gov . Chris Christie vetoed a bill Tuesday that would have prohibited people convicted of carjacking , gang involvement , racketeering or terroristic threats from purchasing , owning , possessing or controlling a firearm .
The bill , A-4182 , would have toughened current law that disqualifies a person who has been convicted of certain serious crimes from purchasing , owning , possessing or controlling firearms .
That bill had passed 37-0 in the Senate and 68-0 , with eight abstaining , in the Assembly .
The vetoed bill provides that a person who has been convicted of carjacking , gang criminality , racketeering , or terroristic threats , and who purchases , owns , possesses or controls a firearm is also guilty of a crime of the second degree .
Currently , state law prohibits people convicted of the following charges from owning a gun : aggravated assault ; arson ; burglary ; escape ; extortion ; homicide ; kidnapping ; robbery ; aggravated sexual assault ; sexual assault ; bias intimidation ; endangering the welfare of a child ; stalking ; a crime involving domestic violence ; certain crimes concerning weapons ; and certain crimes related to controlled dangerous substances .
Under current law , a person who has been convicted of any of these offenses and who purchases , owns , possesses , or controls a firearm is guilty of a crime of the second degree . A second degree crime is punishable by a fine of up to $ 150,000 , a term of imprisonment of five to 10 years , or both .
Democratic Assemblyman Tim Eustace called Christie 's `` failure to act is incomprehensible , '' and accused them of boosting their presidential campaign at the expense of N.J. citizens .
`` Gov . Christie likes to spout platitudes about public safety , '' Eustace said in a statement . `` But their failure to act on a no-brainer bill supported by Democrats and Republicans alike calls into question their ability to lead and even think clearly . ''
Eustace said gun-rights groups `` do n't even support giving such people guns . The governor 's failure is scary and inexplicable . Gov . Christie has put the people of New Jersey in danger . ''
Galaxies collide ! Katee Sackhoff is trading in their Viper-pilot flightsuit for some Mandalorian armor . Battlestar Galactica 's Starbuck is voicing a new , pistol-packing character on Star Wars : The Clone Wars , and , before it even screens tomorrow at the 4:45 p.m. Clone Wars panel at San Diego 's Comic-Con , EW has an exclusive video sneak peek . Check it out below :
Sackhoff will be the first female Mandalorian warrior we 've seen on the show . Them episode , set to air midway through the Cartoon Network series ' fourth season , reunites Padawan Ahsoka Tano with their Separatist friend Lux , who 's renounced Count Dooku 's galaxy spanning war against the Republic . To oppose Dooku , Lux has sought refuge with the Death Watch , a Mandalorian terrorist group .
In case you 've forgotten your Expanded Universe lore , the Mandalorians are the helmeted warrior race that spawned Jango and Boba Fett . When last seen , the Death Watch faction was led by a platinum-haired militant voiced by Jon Favreau ( whose Cowboys & Aliens will make its debut at Comic-Con ) , who will be reprising their role this season as a Big Bad . But the sight ( or rather , sound ) of Sackhoff returning to the space opera genre , with their character this time appearing in chrome-domed glory herself , is cause for a major geekquake . So say we all ?

Inquisitive reader Roho writes : “ * doot-doot-doodeedoodee-doot-doot-doooo-doot * If it 's not already on your list , I 'd love to see a look into ‘ Entry of the Gladiators ' . ”
[ Ringmaster Voice ] Ladies and gentlemen , children of all ages , step right up and guide your ears toward this blog as the circus music is about to begin ! [ /Ringmaster Voice ]
Most folks know this tune only as “ circus music ” or “ merry-go-round music ” . It is often heard pounded out of horn ensembles , marching bands , and calliopes , usually before clowns start running around and frightening small children . However , the original piece had nothing to do with circuses .
That is a snippet of a 1897 military march by Julius Fučík ( pronounced “ FOOT-sheek ” ) . It was originally titled Grande Marche Chromatique , but was later renamed Entrance of the Gladiators because Fučík had a thing for Romans . ( The clip above is from a recording by the Cincinnati Pops Orchestra under Erich Kunzel . You can hear the whole thing here . )
Thirteen years later , a Canadian composer named Louis-Philippe Laurendeau came along and adapted Entrance of the Gladiators for a small band and re-titled it “ Thunder and Blazes ” . This adaptation of the music sold widely , and was picked up by circuses and used as a “ screamer march ” and as music for fairground organs and calliopes .
ABOUT JULIUS FUČÍK
Julius Fučík was born in Prague , Czechoslovakia in 1872 . As a student , they studied composition under none other than Antonín Dvořák , a man who is now known as one of the more influential composers of 20th century music . In 1891 , Fučík struck out into the world to work as a musician and composer for several military bands , working at one point under Josef Wagner , another famous military composer in their own right . ( Wagner is the man who wrote the Under the Double Eagle march , which Monty Python nerds know from Terry Gilliam 's animations of dancing teeth . )
In 1897 , Fučík wrote Entrance of the Gladiators while working in the Czech army as bandleader for the 86th Infantry Regiment in Sarajevo .
In 1907 , they wrote another popular march , the Florentiner March . While that piece of music never reached the memetic fame of Entrance of the Gladiators , it is a popular repertory piece for military bands today .
Fučík became a renowned bandleader during their career . By the time Laurendeau 's “ Thunder and Blazes ” hit North America , Fučík was in Bohemia as the bandmaster of the 92nd Infantry Regiment in Theresienstadt , one of the finest bands in the Austro-Hungarian Empire . In 1913 , they proceeded to create their own band and music publishing company , Tempo Verlag . ( Note : there is an unrelated Czech music publishing company named A-Tempo Verlag , which was founded in 1993 . )
Unfortunately , World War I eventually arrived and ruined everything . Fučík 's business and health failed in wartime . They died of cancer in 1916 in Berlin , Germany , aged 44 . They are buried at Vyesehradsky Hrbitov in Prague .
ABOUT LOUIS-PHILIPPE LAURENDEAU
Louis-Philippe Laurendeau was a Canadian composer , bandmaster , writer , and music publisher . Born in 1861 in Quebec , Laurendeau died in the same year as Fučík : 1916 .
Most of Laurendeau 's arrangements were published under Cundy-Bettony ( a now-defunct Boston-based music publisher ) or Carl Fischer , a music publisher where Laurendeau held an editorial position . ( Carl Fischer , incidentally , is still in business today , 140 years after its birth . Based in New York City 's East Village , the company is still family owned and serves 1,400 retailers . )
Laurendeau made the smaller-band arrangement of Fučík 's Entrance of the Gladiators in 1910 , publishing it as “ Thunder and Blazes ” under Carl Fischer . In the original publication , the piece is credited to “ Fučík-Laurendeau ” .
ABOUT THE MUSIC
Wikipedia has this description of the musical construction of Entrance of the Gladiators :
Generally , the march is divided into three parts . The first part contains the melody that the trumpet keeps and the several supporting parts . The second third is the section where the low brass ( mainly the tubas ) take over with the chromatic scale like role . Finally there is a trio , or a slow melodic section , where there is a strong balance between woodwinds and low brass . The trio has a part similar to the second third with a chromatic scale like sound . The piece is written in cut time and is originally written to be played at standard march tempo ; however , when played as a screamer it is usually played much faster .
Okay , time for a translation for the people who are n't already music nerds .
A chromatic scale is a musical scale with twelve pitches , each one semitone above/below one another . Modern Western music is mostly written with notes set on a chromatic scale , with each note equidistant from its neighbor in terms of tone . ( This was n't always the case . If you want to really fall down the rabbit hole of the internet , start looking into arguments about things like Pythagorean tuning and just intonation . ) In other words , if you look at a modern piano , the white and black keys all fall on a chromatic scale . If you start play one piano key and then play the next 11 keys above that , you will arrive at the same note , except one octave higher than your starting point . In Entry of the Gladiators , you can hear the woodwinds and horns swoop up and down all the notes on the chromatic scale .
( If you want a visual aid for this , check out this video of Entrance of the Gladiators being played on a piano roll . )
“ Cut time ” refers to a time signature of 2/2 . But what is a time signature ? Well , it 's the numbers you see at the front of a musical composition on paper :
A time signature tells a musician two things : how many beats there are in a measure , and what sort of note represents one beat . In the image of a 3/4 time signature above , there are three beats in each measure , and a quarter note represents one beat . The three notes you see above , with the stems and filled dots , are quarter notes , so you see one full measure represented . In a full piece of music , multiple measures are strung together to form musical patterns and melodies .
Back to cut time . A time signature of 2/2 says that there are two beats per measure ( top number ) , and that a half note ( stem with an open circle ) is one beat . Cut time is also known as alla breve , and is often found in marches .
Tempo is the speed at which each beat is played . “ March tempo ” is 120 beats per minute , a simple 2 beats per second . But the Wikipedia bit says that Entry of the Gladiators is played faster when it 's played as a “ screamer march ” , so what is this “ screamer march ” thing ?
ABOUT SCREAMER MARCHES
A screamer march is a particular breed of march , one of those exciting , upbeat , barn burner marches favored at circuses .
According to Wikipedia , screamer marches were mostly written between 1895 and 1955 . Since they are meant to whip up the crowd into a frenzy of excitement , screamer marches have several shared characteristics :
A screamer march is often faster than a normal march , played at 130 to 150 beats per minute .
Many screamer marches have overlapping melodies .
Due to the speed and complexity of the music , screamer marches are often challenging to play , particularly for brass instruments .
Screamer marches tend to stay at one volume .
The Wikipedia article contains a long list of other interesting screamer marches , in case you want to be whipped into a frenzy of excitement .
ABOUT CIRCUSES
Circuses originated in ancient Roman times . Originally , a circus was a building , made for the purpose of exhibitions : horse shows , battle re-enactments , and whatnot . Think of the chariot race in Ben-Hur : that oval track is a Roman circus .
The word “ circus ” came to mean a performance instead of a building during the 18th century . It was at this time competing equestrian shows were touring around Europe . In 1872 , Charles Didbin and Charles Hughes , opened a show named Royal Circus on November 4 , 1782 in Lambeth , London , England . The show was meant to compete with Philip Astley ‘ s Amphitheater of Equestrian Arts , which was just a short distance away . Astley 's show , which involved jugglers and clowns as well as horses , established the structure of the modern circus , but Didbin is the person who actually gave the term ‘ circus ' its modern meaning .
The circus was again revolutionized in the United States when a man named P. T. Barnum came along . Barnum was 61 years old when they established “ P . T. Barnum 's Grand Traveling Museum , Menagerie , Caravan & Hippodrome ” in Delavan , Wisconsin in 1871 with partner William Cameron Coup . In addition to the usual clowns , jugglers , and animals , Barnum 's circus invented the “ three ring circus ” setup , as well as the inclusion of a “ freak show ” .
In 1881 , Barnum 's show merged with James Bailey and James Hutchinson to form “ P.T . Barnum 's Greatest Show On Earth , And The Great London Circus , Sanger 's Royal British Menagerie and The Grand International Allied Shows United ” . Thankfully , this was later shortened to “ Barnum & Bailey ” .
It was under Barnum 's watch that circuses became a cultural phenomenon in North America . Barnum was one of the shrewdest marketers in all history , becoming known as the Shakespeare of Advertising .
Barnum & Bailey were n't without competitors , though . The Ringling Brothers Circus was founded in 1884 by five brothers in Baraboo , Wisconsin . ( Seriously , what is with Wisconsin and circuses ? ! ) Within a few years , the Ringling Brothers Circus established itself as one of the best-run circuses on the circuit .
Eventually , Ringling Brothers grew larger than Barnum & Bailey , and the Ringling Brothers acquired the other circus in 1907 . The shows ran separately until 1919 , when they merged to become Ringling Brothers Barnum & Bailey Circus , also known as The Greatest Show on Earth .
If you note the dates , the Ringling Brothers and Barnum & Baily circuses were both running strong by 1910 , when “ Thunder and Blazes ” was published in the United States . While it is undocumented which circus or circuses picked up the song , it is interesting to note that the song 's publication happened just as circuses were becoming a part of the American pop culture history , which probably explains why the song is so strongly associated with circuses .

Attorney General Jeff Sessions directed federal prosecutors to pursue harsher charges against undocumented immigrants who commit crimes , or repeatedly cross into the U.S. illegally , and they promised to add 125 immigration judges in the next two years to address a backlog of immigration cases .
The moves are part of the administration 's efforts to deter illegal immigration and meant to target gangs and smugglers , though nonviolent migrants could also face more severe prosecutions .
In a memo issued Tuesday , Mr . Sessions instructed prosecutors to make a series of immigration offenses “ higher priorities , ” including transporting or harboring illegal immigrants , illegally entering or re-entering the country , or assaulting immigration-enforcement agents .
The memo also required prosecutors to consider charging some undocumented immigrants with aggravated identity theft , which carries a mandatory two-year prison term .
In remarks Tuesday to border patrol agents at the U.S.-Mexico border in Nogales , Ariz. , Mr . Sessions spoke in stark terms about the threat they said illegal immigration posed .

“ We mean international criminal organizations that turn cities and suburbs into warzones , that rape and kill innocent civilians , ” Mr . Sessions said in their delivered remarks , referring to gangs run by illegal immigrants . “ It is here , on this sliver of land , on this border , where we first take our stand . ”
The passage had drawn attention because the prepared remarks released by the Justice Department had included the phrase “ take our stand against this filth. ” But Mr . Sessions deviated from their prepared remarks and did n't say “ filth ” as they delivered their speech .
“ This is a new era , ” Mr . Sessions said during their speech . “ This is the Trump era . ”
Former prosecutors said they did n't expect the memo to dramatically affect U.S. attorneys offices along the southern border , which already bring thousands of such cases each year . They said it could have an impact on those farther inland , which have n't historically focused on immigration violations .

In the fiscal year that ended in September , 52 % of all federal criminal prosecutions involved immigration-related offenses , according to Justice Department data analyzed by Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse at Syracuse University .
The largest number of cases—24,549—came from the Southern District of Texas , whose border with Mexico stretches from Brownsville to Laredo , Texas .
Coming to America How immigration policy has changed the U.S .
“ Those cases are brought and prosecuted on a daily basis in all those border districts , ” said Jeffery Vaden , who worked as a prosecutor in that office from 1999 to 2011 and is now a lawyer at Bracewell LLP in Houston .
The memo did instruct prosecutors in the border offices to develop guidelines for prosecuting “ improper entry ” cases , which Mr. Vaden said their former office had not prioritized as much , given the number of such violations .

“ That might be a more aggressive push . If you start filing those , there will be a lot more cases to deal with , ” they said .
Peter Skinner , a former federal prosecutor in the Manhattan U.S. attorney 's office who has prosecuted immigration crimes said that cases alleging unlawful rentry are easy to bring but could stretch that office 's resources if it is required to prioritize more such cases .
“ If they 're all of a sudden allocating more of their time to an immigration docket , other stuff will suffer as a result , ” said Mr. Skinner , who is now a partner at Boies Schiller Flexner LLP .
According to the Trump administration , its broader crackdown on illegal immigration through raids and deportations has led to a dramatic drop in illegal crossings at the border .

In February , the government reported the lowest monthly total of illegal crossings in at least five years , according to the Department of Homeland Security .
In their remarks , Mr . Sessions said the March tally showed a 72 % drop from December . Border apprehensions stood at 58,431 in December , and fell to 16,600 in March , according to Customs and Border Protection data .
The memo also instructed every district to designate a “ border security coordinator ” by April 18 , who would be responsible for overseeing immigration-related prosecutions .
Immigration advocates said they worried that the memo and tone set by the administration was describing a closer link between criminal behavior and immigration than statistics show .
“ We are seeing an overemphasis on prosecuting , at the federal level , immigration , illegal entry and re-entry cases , and far less paid to criminal violations that implicate public safety , ” said Gregory Chen , director of advocacy for the American Immigration Lawyers Association .
Troy Eid , a former U.S. attorney in Colorado during President George W. Bush 's administration , said Mr . Sessions was “ spot-on ” to focus on illegal immigrant crimes , citing data from the U.S . Sentencing Commission that found that one in every four criminals sentenced to federal prison is an unlawful immigrant who was deported but returned illegally to the U.S .
Mr . Sessions also said the agency would put in place a “ streamlined hiring plan ” that they said would get immigration judges on the bench at a quicker pace .
The Trump administration previously announced a boost in hiring judges as part of its budget proposal for 2018 ; funding must be approved by Congress .
The Obama administration had tried to hire more judges , Mr. Chen said , but that process was slowed by vetting .

The Supreme Court heard oral arguments this past week in a case that may well decide the fate of the First Amendment in America .
A case that began in 2012 has finally snaked its way to the Supreme Court , and the stakes could not be higher . Colorado Baker Jack Phillips was sued and harassed by the Colorado Civil Rights Commission after they refused to bake a wedding cake for a same-sex wedding ceremony , citing their Christian faith .
Phillips did not disparage the same-sex couple that came to their store , Masterpiece Cakeshop , they just referred the couple to another bakery because of their Christian conviction that marriage is the relationship between one man and one woman . David Mullins , the man who placed the order for the cake , refused to take no for an answer and decided to destroy Jack Phillips 's company .
The Colorado Civil Rights Commission found that Mr. Phillips did not have a right to religious liberty when it came to baking a wedding cake , and drove them out of business . The question that has now come to the Supreme Court is whether or not sexual expression is championed above the constitutional right to religious liberty . The Left has , for decades , attempted to have sexual orientation and action treated equally with race and gender under Civil Rights protections . This argument is spurious at best , as race and gender are immutable , involuntary traits of an individual while sexual preference is not , but it has proven to be quite the legal juggernaut .
Liberals are comparing Mr. Phillips 's refusal to bake a wedding cake to restaurant owners refusing to serve African American patrons in the sixties . Recently , a Fox News editorial noted that one case likely to be considered precedent is the case of Newman vs. Piggie Park Enterprises , Inc. from 1968 .
This was a case regarding the refusal of service to African American patrons at a BBQ restaurant in Columbia , SC . The owner , Maurice Bessinger argued that their decision to refuse service was based on their religious belief “ any integration of the races whatsoever ” is wrong . Bessinger was a known virulent racist , and their position was , in the words of the Supreme Court decision , “ patently frivolous . ”
There is no comparison , however , between the evil actions of Maurice Bessinger and the religious conviction of Jack Phillips .
Religious liberty protections are not a license to discriminate ; they are protections for people of faith not to be discriminated against . Mr. Phillips cake shop did not refuse to serve people based on immutable , involuntary traits , nor did it refuse to serve gay and lesbian individuals as a matter of routine course .
Mr. Phillips merely stated that they would not participate in a same-sex marriage ceremony that they believe violates the holy sanctity of the sacrament of marriage . There is a clear difference between Bessinger making-up a “ religious ” belief and Jack Phillips citing a long-standing tenet of the Judeo-Christian belief system .
The Supreme Court should rule in Mr. Phillips 's favor for the same reason it ruled against Maurice Bessinger : to protect the constitutional rights of people being aggressively deprived of them by a bigoted enemy .
Some people dream of Jeannie with the light brown hair . Not me , and it 's not just because I am married . I dream of cars in barns , in fields , behind hedge rows , in garages falling down with only the vague shape of a car inside . I gather stories and hope for a good tip from a fellow car hunter .
When I walk down an overgrown path behind the abandoned barn I 'm not thinking of a woman at all . I 'm looking for the familiar slope of a Mustang fastback roof barely visible under a tin roof shed behind a stand of pines . Nothing makes my heart race quite like that ( well almost nothing ) .
I remember the red 1969 Mustang BOSS 429 like the one that sold at Barrett-Jackson ( Scottsdale 2007 ) for $ 605,000 . I know , I know prices at Barrett-Jackson are seldom what they seem . Sometimes it feels like a privileged few sells the cars back and forth to themselves and pay for the cars with monopoly money . But the $ 605,000 was real money .
If two drunk rich guys both want a car , the price may not be a good indication of the market – that 's ok by me if real money changes hands . But if its only friends bidding up a buddy ' s car , that really hurts the hobby and distorts prices .
Many a fine restored BOSS 429 has sold for less than $ 200,000 . That 's definitely not chump change . But imagine finding one . Not to sell but to keep , and to drive ! Then it 's time to move the wife 's new Shelby out of the garage and into the rain .
They built only 859 of these cars . I believe they are one of the most desirable Mustangs ever . And I know for a fact some are still out there waiting to be found . Well , less than 500 of these cars are accounted for which means there is a good chance , actually a great chance , that you can find one . I have reliable information on where two are right now . At least I 'm running down the rumors . One is in Iowa and one in Arkansas . I have intelligence I believe to be true – at least a dozen are out there rotting away in plain sight .
As you know these cars are priced from # 1 Condition which is “ best of show ” quality . Some are restored and some are great survivors detailed like new . In today 's prices “ The BOSS ” in # 1 Condition would be worth $ 195,000 . A real concourse champion with a unique history may be worth 50 % to 100 % more . A # 2 Car is worth $ 170 000 down to a # 5 Car at about $ 120,000 . A # 5 Car is not a basket case . Remember even a # 5 Car is usually driveable but unrestored–showing normal wear and tear .

Douglas Adams 's legacy rests far beyond the literally universal reaches of the famous Hitchhiker 's Guide to the Galaxy , stretching into the wildlife activist plains of “ Last Chance to See ” and a private detective 's office at London 's Peckender Street with “ Dirk Gently 's Holistic Detective Agency ” . Dirk Gently first became a BBC Four TV Show in 2010 when it was created by Howard Overman with the title character played by Stephen Mangan . Recently , however , BBC America remade the Dirk Gently paradigm , giving worldwide distribution rights to Netflix . The show is now based in Seattle ( shot in Vancouver ) and a lot of the characters have been changed .
The acting is as random as the show itself
In the new Dirk Gently 's Holistic Detective Agency , Samuel Barnett plays the title character with Elijah Wood playing a newly named sidekick , Todd , because Richard MacDuff from the books possibly sounded too Shakespeare-y for the quirky hipster vibe they tried to achieve . Elijah does a great job playing Todd , however , as their character is a bit like Frodo ; has no clue what 's going on but in the end they want to do the right thing .
This is juxtaposed with Dirk , who is now apparently literally The Doctor from Doctor Who . The manic pixie British boy archetype is too far removed from what the original Dirk Gently was , in both the books and the previous ( unrelated ) TV series , to make it comfortable . It does n't help that Samuel Barnett 's interpretation of the token BBC fangirl guy takes a bit of getting used to before giving them a chance . He 's actually quite annoying in the first episode – the moment they pop through the window you 're almost wanting to change the figurative channel , and by the end of the first episode , you 're bound to want to swallow a cyanide pill . I 'm not railing against the actor , just the character that Dirk Gently is written as . There are some awkward performances from some of the actors ; the characters of Farah , Amanda and the guy who keeps shooting people for no reason ( you 'll see ) feel like they could use some polish .
Dirk Gently is fundamentally different than from the books
It does n't seem very Douglas Adams to write a story with an intense , sanguine glimpse into reality – no one got beaten to death with a guitar in the books and I do n't remember any high level government conspiracies . In fact , the lack of bureaucratic efficacy was one of the centrepieces of their work . Characters would n't suddenly get whacked off in their world like they do in the show , and despite the ridiculous , comedic premise of the entire thing , the show conveys a sunless , stygian atmosphere . That could just be Seattle though .
Adams 's work always revolved around the quirks and unique intricacies of the universe , and this show has managed to capture that in a different , non Douglas Adams sort of way . The details are entirely different , and so is the style , but the core essence of Dirk Gently , which is that everything is connected and the universe is just weird as fuck , remains at the centre of the writing .
It all makes sense in the end
If you do start watching Dirk Gently 's Holistic Detective Agency , the first episode or two will be a barrage of questions . You 'll be asking yourself and everyone around what 's going on , and even the characters do n't seem to have a clue . There are atleast 7 groups of individuals , some seemingly part of the plot for no apparent reason . By the 8th and final episode of the season , “ Two Sane Guys Doing Normal Things ” , everything weaves together into one neatly woven tea towel of plots . From time travel to metaphysical interactions , from magic lightbulbs to rogue government contractors , Dirk Gently has it all . If you come in expecting scenes out of the books , you 're going to be disappointed – Max Landis 's adaptation is n't a straightforward one . It is random , it is funny , and it is self-prophesying , just not in a Douglas Adams way . It 's more Landis 's voice than Adams 's , but it 's done well , which means it actually is n't a bad thing .
Dirk Gently 's Holistic Detective Agency explores one mystery in its 8 episodes , unlike Stephen Mangan 's Dirk Gently , which had a different premise every episode . I think this format owes well to what the show tries to accomplish . With a reckless abandon for conformity and conventionality , the characters seem confused yet crisp . Everyone knows their purpose intrinsically , even though they have no clue what 's going on . Despite not capturing the original tone of the books , Max Landis manages to capture this very important facet , the fact that the universe is weird and funny and really quite profound if you want to get philosophical about it . There is an otherworldly aura to the story without the direct involvement of aliens who want to build intergalactic bypasses or something .
In our opinion , the new Dirk Gently is n't supposed to be an adaptation of the books . It 's supposed to be a prequel . There 's a line where Dirk mentions in the first episode about their run-in with Thor and their case about a sofa . The meeting of Dirk and Todd for the first time gives us a glimpse into what the dynamic would have been like when they first met .
So , should you watch it ?
You should watch Dirk Gently if you 're even tangentially into quirky , weird or otherwise suspenseful comedy . It 's not as deep as the books and has a broader , more universal appeal . Which does n't mean it 's toned down to a soggy slush of dribble , but rather brings the themes of the originals to life using the TV platform . If you ca n't stand some Doctor Who-esque archetypes or soppy romance and want a Dirk Gently more gritty and with stronger ties to the books , watch the 2010 Dirk Gently with Stephen Mangan .
Dirk Gently 's Holistic Detective Agency is available on BBC America , and the AMC app in the United States . Everywhere else , it 's available to stream on Netflix .
Some tips before watching Netflix 's Dirk Gently :
The first episode is really weak . If you get through it , though , you 're in for a treat . The best episode is the last one where the culmination of all the different plots come into play . Do n't expect it to be a direct adaptation of the books . The story is entirely different , characters have been changed , and the timeline is off . It could be a prequel , though . The tone is very different from a typical Douglas Adams adaptation . Max Landis does a good job of making it different in a good way though .

Deranged Trump Emulates Hitler Youth Speech to Boy Scouts
S. Novi Blocked Unblock Follow Jul 25 , 2017
Trump is indeed testing the country as to exactly how much outrage we can stand . In their July 24th speech at the Boy Scout Jamboree at Summit in Glen Jean , WV , they may have forgotten that they were speaking to impressionable young men…or maybe not .
If you could stomach watching this speech you would have heard a more modern twist on an old format . It did n't seem to matter that these kids were not involved in politics , it was the message that was being overtly and subliminally sent , and it was done by Hitler with hit ‘ Hitler Youth Movement ' .
As per the History Learning Site :
“ The Hitler Youth catered for 10 to 18 year olds . There were separate organizations for boys and girls . The task of the boys section was to prepare the boys for military service . For girls , the organization prepared them for motherhood . ”
The Trump speech was mingled with congratulatory comments regarding the Boy Scouts in attendance as well as their goals , dreams and aspirations . However , once they got their attention and potential adoration , the deranged man that is in the White House began adding their own interpretations of what these kids should be supporting .
A Business Insider article listed it best :
“ When Trump declared they would “ kill ” Obamacare , boy scouts in the audience began chanting “ U-S-A. ” When Trump asked the crowd if President Barack Obama had ever attended the jamboree , they booed Obama — who was a boy scout himself , as a child — while Energy Secretary Rick Perry and Price , who were standing behind Trump on stage , laughed and clapped .
Obama delivered a video address to the jamboree in 2010 for the boy scout organization 's 100th anniversary . ”
As they railed against Hillary Clinton and President Obama , the Boy Scouts ‘ booed ' , and this until itself is a symbol of the same exact type of thing that Hitler did . Wrapping love of country and congratulatory remarks around a campaign delivery of hate . Hitler demanded loyalty to their ideas of making Germany great , and that is closely associated with the constant chest beating anthem that Trump uses for the U.S .
The goal of Hitler Youth was to begin gleaning the attention of young men and women who would support the ideologies of the Nazi regime . These are impressionable minds that can be molded and in doing so they would see them enter adulthood as obedient Stormtroopers for the boys and for the girls , a lifetime of submissive existence in childbearing .
Trump 's unacceptable comments had a single purpose , and that was to rally the youth behind their cause . These kids may be too young to realize that they support hate , racism , sexism and bigotry and lies so often that the fact checkers ca n't keep up with him….but their parents are aware .
Parents Are Screaming Their Objections
It did n't take long for social media to erupt in an explosion of complaints . From Facebook to Twitter , parents were expressing their disgust .
In the same Business Insider article they posted some of the Tweets from parents of Boy Scouts :
“ Some parents expressed concern about their sons being “ indoctrinated ” at Boy Scouts events . ”
“ Parents were also “ horrified ” to see their sons ' hard earned achievements be “ politicized . ”
Parents are listing their grievances including the fact that many are either pulling their sons out of the Boy Scouts or wo n't allow their sons to join now that this abomination event has occurred .
But parents are n't just relying on social media to express their anger . They are calling the direct line of the Boy Scouts of America at 972 580–2000 , but when you call — they forward you to a recorded message indicating their stand on non-partisanship without the ability to leave your own voice message .
“ In an emailed statement to Business Insider , the Boy Scouts of America said :
“ The Boy Scouts of America is wholly non-partisan and does not promote any one position , product , service , political candidate or philosophy . The invitation for the sitting U.S. President to visit the National Jamboree is a long-standing tradition and is in no way an endorsement of any political party or specific policies . The sitting U.S. President serves as the BSA 's honorary president . It is our long-standing custom to invite the U.S. President to the National Jamboree . ”
In a NY Post article they stated the following :
“ The Boy Scouts official Facebook page was flooded with angry comments from parents and former scouts who called Monday 's speech by President Trump “ unbelievably tacky and disrespectful . ”
“ A statement from the [ Boy Scouts of America ] denouncing this speech and the conduct of the crowd booing a former president needs to be forth coming immediately , ” Robin Tilson wrote .
“ Everything that the BSA stands for was discredited today by this speech and the reaction from many attendees . ”
“ As of this moment , still awaiting a statement denouncing the President 's speech , and their attempt to turn the BSA into the Trump Youth , ” said Colorado resident Thomas Bailey , who said they were an Eagle Scout .
Publications all over the globe are not missing the link between the Trump speech to 40,000 young boys and the same type of loyalty and honor rhetoric that Hitler spewed to the young men in Germany .
Trump has crossed many lines and is continuing to exhibit erratic behavior that is exemplifying them as a potential dictator . Getting the support of the youth is just part of the endgame . In a previous article that I wrote : “ Is the Trump Administration a Fascist Regime ? ” , I include the quote :
“ Those who can not remember the past are condemned to repeat it . — George Santayana ”
It appears that it is up to each of us to step forward , gloves off , and demand that this insanity be stopped . The Republicans in power will not move against them both out of fear of retribution and because they are their ‘ useful idiot ' to shove their agenda through .
If you do n't want continued indoctrination of the youth of our country , the time is now to stop it .
A digitally-enhanced axial MRI of the upper chest ( as if viewed from the feet ) . Areas of potential brown fat are shown in green .
In the world of brown fat news , this is kind of a big deal .
Researchers for the first time have been able to capture evidence of brown fat in a living adult via MRI ( magnetic resonance imaging ) , which is an important step in learning how to activate its powers for weight loss .
`` The MRI allows us to distinguish between the brown fat , and the more well-known white fat that people associate with weight gain , due to the different water to fat ratio of the two tissue types , '' study researcher Thomas Barber , Ph.D. , of the Department of Metabolic and Vascular Health at Warwick Medical School , said in a press release . `` We can use the scans to highlight what we term 'regions of interest ' that can help us to build a picture of where the brown fat is located . ''
The results of Barber 's study are published in the The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism . Now , the next step is to test out the MRI method on larger groups of people .
Brown fat tissue works by burning up regular fat for warmth . Rodents and human babies have a lot of brown fat to keep them warm , but it was n't until fairly recently that scientists discovered that some adult humans still have traces of brown fat that burn calories when cold . In fact , leaner people have more brown fat , and it seems to protect them from diabetes , according to Science Now . Obese people , on the other hand , do n't seem to have much of it at all , reports the New York Times .
In the past , researchers have relied on PET ( positron emission tomography ) to locate brown fat in human beings . PET scans work by injecting subjects with a special kind of glucose that binds to the areas you want to study ( see photos of brown fat PET scans ) . Then subjects lay down and are placed in an imaging machine to locate the glucose , which is clinging to the brown fat .
Chinese state media says 156 people were killed in the unrest in Urumqi on Sunday [ EPA ]
Chinese state media says 156 people were killed in the unrest in Urumqi on Sunday [ EPA ]
Hundreds arrested
Several objects were thrown and fighting broke out when Uighur protesters advanced towards lines of anti-riot police carrying clubs and shields .
The latest clash came as a group of foreign reporters , including Al Jazeera 's correspondent , were being taken on a tour of the city to see the aftermath of Sunday 's riots .
The protest follows reports that Chinese police had arrested more than 1,400 people in a crackdown aimed at stifling Uighur unrest .
Earlier on Tuesday , state media quoted the head of the Chinese Communist party in Xinjiang as saying Sunday 's unrest had been quelled , although they warned `` this struggle is far from over '' .
Wang Lequan called for officials to launch `` a struggle against separatism '' .
The worst unrest in Xinjiang for many years has led authorities to impose a security lockdown on much of the region .
Hundreds of paramilitary police with rifles , clubs and shields have been deployed on the streets of Urumqi and a night-time curfew was imposed on Monday .

Local residents also reported that internet and mobile phone connections in Urumqi were down .
According to Chinese state media , Sunday 's clashes erupted after a demonstration against the government 's handling of an industrial dispute turned violent .
Reports also suggested that the unrest could be spreading to other parts of the vast Xinjiang region .
According to China 's state-run Xinhua news agency , police dispersed around 200 people on Monday evening who had gathered outside the main mosque in the ancient Silk Road city of Kashgar .
Exiles reject blame
The Chinese government has blamed Uighur exiles for stoking the unrest , singling out Rebiya Kadeer , a Uighur business person who was jailed for years in China before being released into exile in the US where they now head the World Uighur Congress , for `` masterminding '' the unrest .
Xinjiang and the Uighurs
Xinjiang is officially an autonomous region in China 's west .
Region is sparsely populated but has large reserves of oil , gas and minerals .
Xinjiang was formerly a key transit point on the ancient Silk Road linking China to Europe .
Region 's Turkic speaking Uighur population number around eight million .
Uighur activists say migration from other parts of China is part of official effort to dilute Uighur culture in their own land .
Uighurs say they face repression on a range of fronts , including bans on the teaching of their language .
Uighur separatists have staged series of low-level attacks since early 1990s .
China says Uighur separatists are terrorists and linked to al-Qaeda .
`` Rebiya had phone conversations with people in China on July 5 in order to incite , and websites such as Uighurbiz.cn and Diyarim.com were used to orchestrate the incitement and spread of propaganda , '' said Nur Bekri , the governor of Xinjiang .
And Communist party official Wang said `` we must tear away Rebiya 's mask and let the world see them true nature '' .
But Kadeer , a 62-year-old mother of 11 , rejected the accusations on Monday , saying from Washington that they were `` completely false '' .
`` I did not organise any protests or call on the people to demonstrate , '' they said .
Explaining to reporters that they called their brother in Xinjiang when they learnt of the violence in Urumqi to warn them 40 relatives in the region to stay away from the demonstrations , they said : `` A call I made to my brother does not mean I organised the whole event . ''
Activists say the clashes started when armed police moved in to break up a peaceful demonstration called after two Uighur workers at a toy factory in southern China were killed in a clash with Han Chinese staff late last month .
Kadeer said the protests in Urumqi started peacefully .
`` They were not violent as the Chinese government has accused . They were not rioters or separatists , '' they said .
They did , however , condemn `` the violent actions of some of the Uighur demonstrators '' , saying their organisation supported only peaceful protests .
Alim Seytoff , a spokesperson for the Kadeer 's World Uighur Congress pressure group , told Al Jazeera that the clashes broke out when armed police and armoured vehicles moved in to forcefully break up the demonstration , opening fire on protesters .
`` It is common practice for Beijing to blame outsiders for any problems in Xinjiang , as it does with problems in Tibet , '' they said .
`` The root cause of the problem is really the Chinese government 's long-standing repressive policies . ''
Microsoft Agrees To Hand Over Skype User Data To Russian Police
from the laying-down-for-its-users dept
Microsoft 's defense of its very close relationship with national intelligence agencies has historically been that it `` complies with applicable laws . '' However , its `` compliance '' in the past seemed to have exceeded the compliance of other companies , as it offered the NSA pre-encryption access to most of its popular services as well as `` working closely '' with the agency to allow it to grab both audio and video from Skype , which it acquired in 2011 .
The company has taken a tougher stance in recent weeks , releasing statements that decry the agency 's overreach and promise better protection of users ' information and data . But given this recent development , it appears the tough talk was saber-rattling for the public 's benefit . Microsoft is still very compliant when it comes to working with intelligence agencies .
Microsoft Corporation that owns the Internet call service Skype is ready to keep in store its Russian users ' negotiations , correspondence and data exchange during six months and share it with the Russian police , if necessary , Microsoft 's press office told Itar-Tass .
Microsoft thus confirmed its commitment to work in full compliance with the Russian law , the way it does in all countries of its operations . If any new law is adopted , the company will comply with it as well , the press office said .
According to the document , an individual or a legal entity that has organised users ' contacts on the Internet are to store information about the reception , transmission , delivery and processing of voice information , texts , images , sounds or any other actions in the process of information dissemination and/or data exchange , for six months following such actions and share the mentioned information with the state authorities , if requested .
Well , I suppose there are none of the usual constitutional concerns that might ( theoretically ) limit Microsoft 's obliging attitude towards the Russian 's counter-terrorism efforts . Every Russian Skype user will have their data stored for six months and handed over to the police whenever they ask for it . If the Russian agencies decide they need more data , or want to extend the length of time the data is stored , Microsoft has already agreed to honor any future law targeting its Skype users.The pending legislation covers a whole lot of ground , data-wise.Any service that has user accounts ( which would be close to 100 % of them ) will be required to hold tons of user data and metadata for six months at the behest of Russian authorities . This is n't that much different than the NSA 's data hauls , except that some of its programs do n't specifically ask for permission before grabbing data and the collections are stored onsite by the agency.Details are presumably still being hashed out , but Microsoft has already sworn its allegiance to the Russian law in whatever form it takes after being pushed through the legislative process . Not exactly a heartening indicator of Microsoft 's new-found willingness to stand up to government overreach .

STARKVILLE , Miss.—Mississippi State , statewide and national leaders heralded the opening today [ Nov. 30 ] of MSU 's $ 10 million addition to Mitchell Memorial Library , home of the Ulysses S. Grant Presidential Library and the prestigious Frank J. and Virginia Williams Collection of Lincolniana .
Leaders in education , history , libraries and government -- including the Librarian of Congress and the Archivist of the United States -- praised the 21,000-sq.-ft. addition . The facility contains a state-of-the-art museum chronicling Grant 's life and their significance in American history and a gallery dedicated to the Frank and Virginia Williams Collection of Lincolniana , a recent donation that was considered the largest privately owned Abraham Lincoln collection in America . With hundreds of thousands of historical documents and items housed on-site , the new addition makes Mississippi State a leading destination for research on the Civil War and two presidents who shaped the course of American history .
“ The Frank J. and Virginia Williams Collection of Lincolniana and our remarkable Ulysses S. Grant Collection have made Mississippi State and the Grant Presidential Library a truly national center for the study of the American Civil War , ” MSU President Mark E. Keenum said .
MSU is one of six universities in the nation housing a presidential library . The Grant Library is managed by the Ulysses S. Grant Association and MSU under the direction of John F. Marszalek , Grant Association managing editor and executive director , and Frances N. Coleman , MSU dean of libraries .
“ In 1862 , President Lincoln admonished the American people with , ‘ it is not that we can imagine better , but can we all do better ? ” said Ulysses S. Grant Association President Frank J. Williams . “ I am pleased to say that with these galleries , the collections that support them , the wonderful staff that serve them and the people that use them , we have , in a significant way , done better . ”
Skip Wyatt of FoilWyatt Architects in Jackson planned the overall facility expansion , and Washington , D.C.-based HealyKohler Design created the interior museum and gallery spaces . The Grant museum contains artifacts and interactive media that allow visitors to engage with the context of the times and discover intimate details of Grant 's personal life and beliefs . Brooklyn-based StudioEIS created four life-size statues to highlight different phases of Grant 's life .
Thursday 's ceremony featured remarks from Librarian of Congress Carla Hayden , Archivist of the U.S. David Ferriero and other U.S. and Mississippi officials .
“ I 'm here to give a pledge , ” Hayden said . “ You will have the full resources and services of the Library of Congress to supplement and be a partner with you as you try to expand these resources here . We wanted to say that publicly here today . ”
The Grant Presidential Collection consists of some 15,000 linear feet of correspondence , research notes , artifacts , photographs , scrapbooks and memorabilia . There also are 4,000 published monographs on various aspects of Grant 's life and times . The collection housed at Mississippi State is the largest single collection of Grant papers and additional items in the world .
The gallery for the Frank J. and Virginia Williams Collection of Lincolniana displays , on a rotating basis , more than 100 of the 17,000 priceless artifacts and 12,000 books included in the Williams Collection , which the former Rhode Island Supreme Court Chief Justice and their wife , Virginia , have amassed over several decades . The gallery exhibit includes commentary from Williams on the relevance and importance of featured items .
“ Lots of people could take credit for what we are celebrating today , but it was a real team effort , ” Ferriero said . “ As [ MSU quarterback ] Nick Fitzgerald tweeted on Sunday night , ‘ a program is bigger than one person . We pride ourselves on our ability to always give relentless effort . ' The results of that relentless effort are evident as I walk around this campus today . ”
The new addition to Mitchell Memorial Library also contains MSU 's Congressional and Political Research Center , which houses nine congressional collections , including cornerstone anthologies on MSU alumni and former U.S. members of congress Sen. John C. Stennis and Rep. G.V . “ Sonny ” Montgomery . Other collections include those of U.S. Rep. Marsha Blackburn , former U.S. Reps. David Bowen and Alan Nunnelee , former U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Mike Espy , former Mississippi Lt. Gov . Amy Tuck , State Rep. Steve Holland and State Sen. Jack Gordon .
Others speaking at the dedication ceremony were :
-- “ Thousands upon thousands will come to see these exhibits , ” Mississippi Gov . Phil Bryant said . “ They will marvel that it is here in Mississippi and they will come to know us better . This is a great day for Mississippi 's future . ''
-- “ There is no other library like the one we are celebrating today , ” U.S. Rep. Gregg Harper said shortly before announcing they would like MSU Libraries to be the home of their congressional papers . “ This structure is now a one-of-a-kind collection , including the Frank J. and Virginia Williams Collection of Lincolniana , as well as Mississippi State University 's Congressional and Political Research Center , which houses nine congressional collections , including those of many well-known MSU alumni … If it 's OK with Dean Frances Coleman , I would like to be the 10th . ”
-- “ Today , we 're reminded of the importance of preserving and protecting the papers and artifacts of our shared history , so that we may study it , learn from it and move forward together , stronger and with greater understanding , ” said C.D . Smith , president of the Mississippi Institutions of Higher Learning Board of Trustees .
-- “ This is going to provide opportunities for all of our students in the state of Mississippi and beyond , ” MSU Dean of Libraries Frances Coleman said .
-- “ We have been fortunate to have people working with us to make sure this project is done right , ” said John F. Marszalek , Grant Association managing editor and executive director . “ The result is before you now for everyone in the nation to see . Our greatest days are ahead of us . ”

One need look no further than the construction and reconstruction still going on around Clark and Addison to see the Ricketts family is going after its own victories .
A World Series title is nice . It definitely helps .
Squeezing as much untapped revenue as is viable from the ballclub , Wrigley Field and neighboring community — not to mention spring training in Arizona — requires playing a different kind of hardball , however , and Tom Ricketts and their siblings have their gloves on .
If the Cubs have been aggressive in making over their baseball operations , so too have the Rickettses on the business end . Maybe more so .
The Rickettses are not the first family to own the Cubs . The Wrigleys , whose name remains on the ballpark they took over when it was still called Weeghman Park , controlled the franchise for 62 years .
Although they did not win a World Series , the Wrigleys did amass five National League pennants , including four in 10 seasons from 1929-1938 . But the family that made its fortune in chewing gum saw the team and ballpark as the entirety of the business , and a side business at that .
The neighborhood eventually blossomed into Wrigleyville despite the fact the Wrigleys were passive about it .
The corporation then known as Tribune Co. — and which at the time still owned this newspaper — bought the Cubs from the Wrigleys in 1981 and were a little more aggressive , but nothing like the Rickettses to whom it sold the team , ballpark and related assets in 2009 .
As the Rickettses acquire buildings , help build a hotel , carve out a park-like area for year-round business opportunities and assert control over the neighborhood around Wrigley , it 's becoming Rickettsville in everything but name .

Winning on the field makes the team and everything around it more attractive and more valuable .
Despite its expense , the gut rehab of 103-year-old Wrigley Field also enhances the team 's ability to make money , too , with nicer suites and the perks of club seating commanding bigger prices .
Some of that money goes back into the team . Some goes into debt financing because the Rickettses pressed on with their plans even when Mayor Rahm Emanuel rebuffed their requests for public money — the kind family patriarch Joe Ricketts opposes .
Then they have said they should get concessions on issues such as more night events at Wrigley Field because they did n't get public money .
They caught a break in Mesa , Ariz. , which ponied up big money to fund a minor-league facility that will benefit the Ricketts team .
The Cubs do n't need to turn a profit to benefit the Rickettses , who can be helped by having write-offs and , depending on the structure of the family trust established with the acquisition of the team , as a tax-efficient way to transfer assets between generations .
That the team grows in value enhances the benefits and the potential to throw off cash as well is a huge plus .
Tax planning played a role in the Wrigleys selling the ballclub and field they took control of in 1919 , when William Wrigley Jr. , a minority shareholder since 1915 , upped their investment . Philip K. Wrigley took over for their late father in 1932 , much as P.K . 's son , another William , would succeed them when P.K . died in 1977 .
But the Wrigleys were hit with a big estate-tax bill , so they opted to sell the team . Nothing speaks to how casually they treated the Cubs as a business than the shareholder meeting to approve the sale to Tribune Co .
Will these Cubs players be back on the team next season ? ( Mark Gonzales ) ( Mark Gonzales )
The Wrigleys owned 8,139 of the 10,000 shares of stock in the team . The rest was scattered among hundreds of investors who did so less for the investment than perks such as the promise of preferential treatment in buying tickets should the Cubs ever make it to the World Series .
The perks were going away with the sale , and some of the minority shareholders felt the $ 20.5 million price tag was way too low and argued a more open bidding process would yield a greater return .
Someone with three shares made a motion to postpone the vote . William Hagenah Jr. , who in addition to being Cubs president was the husband of then-Chairman William Wrigley 's sister , put the motion to a voice vote .
The delay was loudly approved , which got the attention of the Wrigleys and their attorneys . Eventually , they figured out a way to void the delay vote and get the deal done . But it took 31/2 hours for what should have been a rubber-stamp deal .
Even Todd Ricketts ' struggle to sell hot dogs on `` Undercover Boss '' was n't that bad .
What 's more , the minority shareholders were probably right . Sticking just to sale prices converted to 2017 dollars , Tribune Co. sold for more than 18 times what it had paid , although the sale price to the Rickettsesincluded a 25 percent stake in what is now NBC Sports Chicago and other assets the team acquired between 1981 and 2009 .
Forbes ' estimate of the franchiseearlier this year : $ 2.68 billion .
To be clear , no one is going to start a crowdsourcing campaign to help the Wrigleys . William Wrigley , who presided over the Cubs sale , inherited an $ 81 million-plus estate from their dad in '77 . They were said to be worth more than $ 2.7 billion when they died in 1999 . That 's the equivalent of $ 4 billion today .
But the Ricketts family , so far , is leaving no opportunity unchewed .
Over the weekend , BlackBerry unveiled its so-called Priv phone in its first official demo . Verdict : It 's uncomfortable to sit through .
You can watch BlackBerry CEO John S. Chen fumbling with the phone , hands hovering maladroitly above its screen and signature retractable keyboard , in an exclusive on-camera interview with Business News Network .
“ And the claim to fame , obviously , ” they said , presenting the phone 's key feature , “ the slider . ”
“ Your finger will be like a mouse , ” they added , waving a semi-clenched hand up and down as though actually manipulating a computer mouse .

The presentation , let 's just say , fails to achieve the level of ex-Apple CEO Steve Jobs ' panache . Indeed , it 's is a far cry from what consumers have come to expect from rival companies such as Apple , which engineer all aspects of their product demos .
In the video , Chen struggles to open a Google Chrome search engine app on the phone 's home screen . They awkwardly tap the glass six times , finds that the app is not yet set up , and proceeds to exit it .
“ Obviously , it runs Google , ” they said , before hitting the roadblock . “ Then I have to set it up , ” they added . “ This is a demo unit . ”
Chen 's hand wavers above other app icons as they mumble and apparently decides to change tack . They talk about the phone 's specs instead .
“ So is this going to be the phone that brings back the BlackBerry user that abandoned because they needed a different operating system ? ” the reporter asked him .
“ I think everyone loved the BlackBerry 10 . They really do , ” they said of the company 's proprietary operating system , which claims a paltry 0.3 % market share , according to research firm IDC . “ But there 's not enough apps . So if I could provide all of the apps of BlackBerry 10 that would be a smashing success . ”
“ Unfortunately , I ca n't put the two together for all the practical reasons and logistic and financial reasons , ” they said , referring to the company 's decision to debut a phone powered by Google 's ( GOOG ) mobile operating system Android . “ But this is really the best thing we could do . ”
You 've got to feel for the guy .

My cat is a bastard . Actually he 's not my cat , he 's my stepdaughter 's cat . And he 's not really a bastard either , just a selfish little guy that does n't compromise with people 's expectations .
They have their own ways of doing things , their style is not human , he 's an Alien with whiskers .
My cat is fun to watch , and a bit creepy at times . You 've already seen how cats behave , I 'm sure you know what I 'm trying to say .
You probably also noticed how they send messages…silently , without uttering a word . They 're the best teachers because they could care less about giving you a lesson .
All they do is nap by the window , or turn their royal butt at a visitor who thought they were a pet . I love how their behavior challenges my own insecurities…And my understanding .
Watching my cat made me want to soak in feline qualities , and if I were to sum up their silent advice , here 's how I 'd phrase it :
Do n't bother proving anything
Do n't be so desperate for approval , that 's what dogs do . Your life is worthy on its own without anybody witnessing it . Do n't fight obstacles , find opportunities
If something gets on your way , be patient , hold on , wait until a window opens for you . In the meantime enjoy something else ( lick your fur clean or take a nap ) . Remain on the outlook for your next chance , it 's just a moment away . Ask for what you need , clearly
Do n't beat around the bush , there 's no reason to be shy about your needs . You 're hungry ? Say it ! Do n't let your surrounding turn a deaf hear to your request ( or they 're no friends ) . Take it easy…
Keep the hissing for the very extreme cases . You can be relaxed most of the time .
You think you 're too stressed to be cool ? Stretch a bit . Do it again . Now try to yawn some . There you go : ) Learn how to cut short
Once again , There 's really no point in losing an eye over an argument , just bite or scratch once to get your point across , then leave . Show love
Look at those that you love , do n't forget to show that you appreciate and value their company . You do n't need to be loud , showing love can be as simple as letting them pet you . Nap like there 's no tomorrow
Sleep as soon as you feel sleepy , do n't postpone it , better take a 20 minutes nap now that you really need it . This tip makes you far more efficient than it seems . Find a cool spot
If you do n't feel right working in the office , do it in the living room or even in your bed , do n't underestimate a quiet moment in the sunset light , that might be the best way to be productive AND relaxed . Do n't pretend you like them
Seriously , if you dislike someone , do n't pretend you do . What 's in it for them in the long run , anyway , rejection ? Unless you intend to make it a spiritual practice , do n't mingle with those who give you the creeps . Play
Play more often , especially because it 's stupid and meaningless . As long as it does n't hurt anyone , play , whatever that means to you .
“ What 's your name , ' Coraline asked the cat . ‘ Look , I 'm Coraline . Okay ? '
‘ Cats do n't have names , ' it said .
‘ No ? ' said Coraline .
‘ No , ' said the cat . ‘ Now you people have names . That 's because you do n't know who you are . We know who we are , so we do n't need names . ”

9yo girl accidentally shoots and kills Arizona gun instructor with Uzi
Updated
A nine-year-old girl accidentally shot and killed a shooting range instructor in Arizona after the recoil on the Uzi submachine-gun they were learning to use sent the weapon over their head .
The instructor , Charles Vacca , 39 , was standing next to the girl at an outdoor range when the accident happened on Monday , the Mohave County Sheriff 's Office said .
`` At about 10:00am , deputies responded to the Last Stop business located at 20606 North Highway 93 in White Hills . Investigations determined a nine-year-old girl accidentally shot the instructor in the head , '' the sheriff 's office said in a statement .
The girl 's family was visiting the shooting range while on holiday , the Los Angeles Times reported .
A video released by the sheriff 's office shows Mr Vacca helping the girl with their stance and their grip on the gun before they fire a test shot .
`` All right , '' Mr Vacca is heard saying .
The girl fires a few more shots and the weapon appears to tilt to the left before the video abruptly ends .
Mr Vacca was airlifted to a medical centre in Las Vegas , about 100 kilometres away , but died shortly after .
`` This is a rarity for something like this to happen , '' a spokesperson for the sheriff 's office told the Los Angeles Times .

Rose McGowan just got fired for pointing out sexism in Hollywood
Last week , Rose McGowan made waves when they posted a snippet of a recent casting call to Twitter . They were insulted by the patronizing nature of the notes . Despite being in the business for over two decades , the casting call made sure to condescendingly remind them ( and the other professional actores auditioning for the part ) to read the script for context .
casting note that came w/script I got today . For real . name of male star rhymes with Madam Panhandler hahahaha I die pic.twitter.com/lCWGTV537t June 18 , 2015
However , the other half of the notes raised more than a few eyebrows . Hollywood is a superficial place , this is known . An actor or actor thrives or fails partially on how they look . But — outside of perhaps the “ Magic Mike ” franchise — the number of times a male actor has been encouraged to show a little more skin is probably low . In fact , what would even BE the male equivalent of “ push-up bras encouraged ” ?
The professional damage to McGowan 's career was swift and merciless . Not that it seems to be slowing them down any…
# awesome # BRINGIT I just got fired by my wussy acting agent because I spoke up about the bullshit in Hollywood . Hahaha . # douchebags June 25 , 2015
Not sure who thought “ firing a woman for pointing out sexism in the clubhouse ” was the best course of action but congratulations ! You just shined an even hotter spotlight on the raging case of misogyny underpinning the industry .

SPRINGDALE , Ark . — For a while , it seemed like the mumps outbreak engulfing this northwestern Arkansas city would never end .
“ The doors would fly open at 9 o'clock in the morning and the lobby would be standing room only , ” said Sandy Hainline Williams , an immunization nurse at a community clinic here .
At one point , the clinic would see 40 people with mumps every day . Hainline Williams said they and other nurses became so adept at mumps testing — swirling cotton swabs between the cheek and the jaw while massaging the salivary glands — they began calling themselves “ swab queens . ”
The epidemic here has slowed since its peak last autumn . But what happened in Springdale has ramifications far beyond the gently rolling hills of the northwest corner of this state . Large and lengthy mumps outbreaks have been reported in multiple places across the US over the past couple of years and , worryingly , often among people who have been vaccinated against the disease .
Last year marked the second-highest annual case count of mumps in more than a quarter-century . All but 13 states have reported mumps so far this year .
The reason for the resurgence is a mystery . But officials fear that it could undermine the public 's faith in immunizations , critical public health tools that are already under attack from people who believe vaccines are more dangerous than the diseases against which they protect .

In Arkansas , health departments sometimes resorted to giving extra doses of the mumps vaccine to try to build immunity in certain people — and some of them still got sick .
“ This is an attack on vaccine confidence , ” veteran vaccine researcher Dr. Stanley Plotkin told the National Vaccine Advisory Committee — a panel that advises the leadership of the Department of Health and Human Services on vaccines — during a February meeting .
Earlier this year , the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention set up a mumps working group . That panel , which consists of CDC and outside experts , will meet again in mid-April to look for answers as to why mumps cases have been on the rise and what can be done to reverse the trend .
While mumps is n't generally severe , there can be serious complications . Men and boys can develop swelling in their testicles — called orchitis — which mostly resolves without incident but can , on rare occasions , lead to sterility . Hearing loss , meningitis , or encephalitis — swelling of the lining of the brain or the brain itself — also occurs on occasion , but rarely .
The most common symptoms are facial swelling , flu-like aches , and fever .
Still , the disease can be no minor inconvenience . The mumps virus has an extraordinarily long incubation period — the time from exposure to illness can take anywhere from 12 to 25 days . That long incubation time means mumps epidemics can drag out over months . Unvaccinated children are excluded from school and ca n't return until 26 days have elapsed since the last case was spotted .
Northwest Arkansas has the highest rate of nonmedical vaccine exemptions — children whose parents opt not to get them vaccinated for philosophical reasons — in the state . When told their children would have to stay home for a minimum of nearly a month , some parents relented and allowed their children to take the vaccine . But others did not . Some of those students may end up missing the entire school year ; state authorities say some parents are livid about that turn of events .
Mumps vaccine is bundled into a combination shot that also protects against measles and rubella . Children are supposed to receive two doses of the MMR vaccine , the first when they are between 12 and 15 months old and the second between the ages of 4 and 6 .

That vaccine was made with a strain of mumps ( strain A ) that circulated in years past but is no longer seen . Laboratory testing suggests the antibodies it generates also protect against the strain currently causing disease ( strain G ) . Still , doubts linger .
“ It 's not unreasonable to think that the vaccine maybe worked better against strains A and B and does n't work quite so well against G , ” said Dr. Dirk Haselow , Arkansas ' state epidemiologist .
The mumps component of the MMR vaccine performs the poorest . While the measles vaccine protects 97 percent of kids who get two doses , the mumps vaccine protects only 88 percent of children who get both doses . And a single dose of the mumps vaccine — which was the recommended regimen until 1989 — only protects about 77 percent of the time .
In the Arkansas outbreak , the vast majority — nearly 92 percent — of the children ages 4 to 18 who contracted mumps had received two doses of the vaccine , Haselow said . Nearly 60 percent of the confirmed Arkansas cases have been children in that age group .
Even though the vaccine does n't appear to be working as well as it once did , there is a notable benefit over the pre-vaccine days . Serious side effects are rarely seen in vaccinated people who contract the mumps .
Haselow said with an outbreak as large as the recent one in Arkansas , the state could have expected about 500 cases of orchitis . “ We 've seen 18 . And we would have seen nearly as many cases of meningitis or encephalitis , and we 've seen zero , ” they said .
The mumps virus is transmitted in saliva , and a number of factors affect how well it spreads . Among them is what Dr. Manisha Patel , a pediatrician who heads the CDC 's mumps team , describes as the force of infection — whether conditions favor viral spread .
“ If I had mumps and I cough right into your face , that might be a different risk … than if I had mumps but was standing over there and you and I never interacted , ” Patel said .
Certain kinds of behaviors put some groups at greater risk for mumps transmission . There have been outbreaks on hockey teams , for instance . Players sometimes share water bottles and have face-to-face shouting confrontations that contribute to the force of infection .
Likewise , universities often become the center of mumps outbreaks , owing to the frequency with which college students may share drinks and cigarettes , to say nothing of increased sexual contact .
In Arkansas , universities played only an incidental role in the outbreak . At least at the beginning , Springdale 's large community of Marshall Islanders were the people getting sick .
A pamphlet written in Marshallese details the services at a clinic in Springdale . Kenneth M. Ruggiano for STAT
No one is quite clear how many people from the roughly 1,000 South Pacific islands that make up the Republic of the Marshall Islands live in Springdale . Citizens of the former US protectorate do n't need visas to live and work in the United States , and in the past 20 years , growing numbers , drawn by plentiful low-skill jobs , have flocked to Northwest Arkansas .
Estimates of the number of Marshallese in the Springdale area range from 8,000 to 14,000 . They live in large family groupings , with multiple generations and sometimes several related families sharing the same dwelling .
“ Everything about their culture sets them up for mumps , ” said Hainline Williams , the nurse coordinator for the Marshallese and Latino communities at the Dr. Joseph H. Bates Outreach Clinic . “ They share their food . They drink [ from the same glass ] after each other . ”
Even at the peak of the epidemic , isolating oneself to avoid transmitting the virus was n't really an option . Nor was staying away from church or the weddings , funerals , or birthday parties that are central to the tight-knit community . “ It spread and it spread and it spread and it spread , ” Hainline Williams said .
“ It 's very unnatural for you to say : ‘ Oh , I 'm not going to come and take part in that . ' Because culturally , that 's not us , ” explained Dr. Sheldon Riklon , a Marshallese doctor — one of only two in the United States — who practices in Springdale .
To try to quell the outbreak , a nurse accompanied by a Marshallese translator went door to door offering extra doses of vaccine . The clinic dispensed 7,600 doses of MMR vaccine during the outbreak .
But members of the community could n't understand why their relatives and neighbors were still getting sick even after the vaccine , said Ioanna Bing , a community research coordinator in the Center for Pacific Islander Health at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences .
Bing , who is Marshallese , said some members of the community thought they might be getting faulty product .
It seems clear the vaccine 's problems could be a double-edged sword — eroding the confidence of vaccine believers while shoring up the resolve of vaccine opponents .

Plotkin , the veteran vaccine researcher who sounded an alarm at the National Vaccine Advisory Committee , declined to be interviewed for this article , explaining in an email that he 's on the CDC working group and is still considering the nature of the mumps problem and how it can be fixed .
But at the February meeting , they raised the possibility a new mumps vaccine may be needed , acknowledging that was “ a frightening proposal . ”
It would be frightening in part because it would be no simple matter . A new mumps vaccine would have to be developed and tested widely to see if it was actually more effective . The task could take years and cost tens of millions of dollars .

Square in the middle of embattled Rowan County is this college town in the Appalachian foothills — home to Morehead State University , a population that swells by 10,000 with the start of each school year , and an active LGBT community .
Beyond the city limits , nearly two-thirds of the county is protected wilderness inside the Daniel Boone National Forest . Small , tightknit communities carry on an Appalachian tradition that has largely resisted change for decades , including followers of the Apostolic Christian faith .
For years , gay members of the university community and Apostolic Christians have tip-toed around each other .
But the Supreme Court 's decision in June in favor of same-sex marriage made a collision perhaps inevitable , as the only thing standing in the way of gays who wanted to marry was the signature of Rowan County Clerk Kim Davis , a member of the Apostolic Church . Them refusal to sign the marriage licenses since June has landed them in jail for contempt of a federal court . Them case is on appeal .
After the ruling , a handful of conservative county clerks in Kentucky sounded the alarm , realizing it would fall on them to issue marriage licenses to gay couples , an idea they abhorred . But unlike in Rowan County , there is no LGBT community to speak of in those other rural areas — few if any gay couples to demand that the county clerk comply with the Supreme Court ruling .
On Friday , the Rowan County clerk 's office issued marriage certificates to at least five same-sex couples . The documents did not bear Kim Davis 's name and were signed by a deputy clerk .
[ The heated scene in Kentucky after clerk refuses to issue same-sex marriage licenses ]
“ This is our civil right , ” said April Miller , a professor of education at Morehead State , when they and their partner , Karen Roberts , emerged from the county courthouse with a marriage certificate .
Davis 's backers in Rowan County have characterized the university as an outside force , a troublemaking interloper .
“ This community is n't divided . This community is united , ” said Pastor Randy Smith , a supporter of Kim Davis . “ The division comes — no disrespect — from Morehead State University . ”
But Wayne Andrews , president of Morehead State University , disagreed : “ I do n't think this issue is dividing our community . ”
In a statement to the Morehead News , they said , “ We believe elected officials should obey the law and do their jobs. ” Many here agree , and not just those connected to the university .

Andrews has been Morehead 's president since 2005 , and during that time the school has consistently ranked among the top public universities in the South by U.S. News & World Report . The university has been racially integrated since 1954 and LGBT-friendly for decades .
“ It 's remarkable how many people are involved in the LGBT community here , ” said Darbi Hardin , a 20-year-old junior at Morehead State and president of ALLYance , a campus-based group that advocates for their rights .
Morehead passed a fairness ordinance in 2013 , becoming one of eight cities in Kentucky to enact such a measure to protect the rights of the LGBT community . The Rowan County Rights Coalition , an off-campus organization , has nearly 1,400 members in its closed Facebook group .
Rowan County has diversified its economy more than most Appalachian counties , but still , some of the best jobs are offered by the government . Davis 's mother , Jean Bailey , was county clerk for 37 years , and Davis was their deputy for 27 of them . Now , Davis employs their son , Nathan Davis , as a deputy . Rowan County allows such nepotism because keeping good jobs in the family is an Appalachian tradition .
“ The people of Rowan County voted them in , ” said Joe Davis , Kim 's husband and Nathan 's father . “ If they were against [ nepotism ] , why did they vote for her ? ”
Davis narrowly won a three-way Democratic primary in 2014 . They cruised to victory in the general election , before same-sex marriage was on the radar , and many supporters of LGBT rights voted for them in November because they were the Democratic candidate .
Now , some county officials are distancing themselves from Davis. “ I 'm a Christian myself , but I guess she 's more devout than I , ” said Rowan County Judge Executive Walter “ Doc ” Blevins . “ I would do it [ issue marriage licenses ] , because it 's the law of the land . That 's what I would do . ”
Several local officials have gone further in their criticism . County Attorney Cecil Watkins has asked Kentucky Attorney General Jack Conway to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate Davis for official misconduct , according to the Lexington Herald-Leader .
Even in those isolated pockets of Rowan County , separated from town by the national forest , support for Davis is not absolute . Jerry Calvert , a retiree who works at the marina at Cave Run Lake , came to the county courthouse Friday to observe the scene , wearing their “ Make Cornbread Not War ” T-shirt .
“ Oh , happy day ! ” Calvert said , as marriage licenses were issued . “ Justice has prevailed . ”
But there are others here who adamantly support Davis with every fiber of their being , literally to their dying breath .
Flavis McKinney , 72 , was also at the courthouse Friday , but to support Davis . Their brother Elbert McKinney could n't be there to show their solidarity . They died Tuesday night at 74 .
“ He died supporting Kim , ” Flavis said .
Correction : An earlier version of this article misstated Morehead 's status among Kentucky cities that have enacted ordinances to ban discrimination in housing , employment and public accommodations based on sexual orientation or gender identity . Morehead was the sixth Kentucky city to enact such an ordinance , not the second .

Guillem Balague spoke to Santi Cazorla about their time as a Malaga player and why they had to leave the club for Arsenal
Arsenal midfielder Santi Cazorla admits they still feel guilty for not being able to say goodbye to Malaga fans properly .
Cazorla helped Malaga qualify for the Champions League in 2012 for the first time in the club 's history after signing from Villarreal .
However , after just one season in southern Spain , Cazorla joined the Gunners after the Andalusian club encountered financial difficulties and had to offload several of their key players .
It was a huge turnaround after Malaga 's Qatari owners had spent so much to make the club competitive on the continent .
Cazorla , who is the club 's record signing , admitted to Revista that it all happened very quickly , and before they knew it , they were an Arsenal player .
`` I left because the club needed money , '' Cazorla said
`` Arsenal was a good opportunity , but Malaga was n't stable and it was n't clear where they were headed .
`` I know that in Malaga lots of people have n't forgiven me for the way I left .
`` When I signed for Arsenal , everything happened so quick , I had to go to London .
Guillem Balague said that Malaga boss Javi Gracia executed a perfect game plan in their side 's win against Barcelona
`` Arsenal had already started their pre-season and I had to go over there for a medical , and then I had to go to Holland to start to train with the squad .
`` That all meant that I could n't go to Malaga to hold a press conference to say goodbye to everyone face to face .
`` In the end , I could only write a letter in which I expressed my gratitude and my affection for the club . I know a lot of people did n't like that .
Scott Minto and the Revista team answer your tweets on the pressing issues in La Liga
`` I 'd like to apologise for not being able to say goodbye properly as I know that would have been the best thing .
`` It still bothers me that I did n't get to do that for the fans . ''
Cazorla admitted that despite spending just one year with the Albicelestes , they still look back fondly on what was a successful period for the club .
`` It was a big thing for Malaga because in those days , they had never competed to get into Europe , '' Cazorla added .
`` We exceeded expectations and ended up playing in the Champions League .
`` It was an unforgettable experience . ''
WASHINGTON ( AP ) — A firsthand account of the Navy SEAL raid that killed Osama bin Laden contradicts previous accounts by administration officials , raising questions as to whether the terror mastermind presented a clear threat when SEALs first fired upon him .
Bin Laden apparently was shot in the head when they looked out of their bedroom door into the top-floor hallway of their compound as SEALs rushed up a narrow stairwell in their direction , according to former Navy SEAL Matt Bissonnette , writing under the pseudonym Mark Owen in “ No Easy Day. ” The book is to be published next week by Penguin Group ( USA ) 's Dutton imprint .
Bissonnette says they were directly behind a point man going up the stairs in the pitch black hallway . Near the top , they said , they heard two shots , but the book does n't make it clear who fired them . They wrote that the point man had seen a man peeking out of a door on the right side of the hallway .
The author writes that the man ducked back into their bedroom and the SEALs followed , only to find the man crumpled on the floor in a pool of blood with a hole visible on the right side of their head and two women wailing over their body .
Bissonnette says the point man pulled the two women out of the way and shoved them into a corner . They and the other SEALs trained their guns ' laser sights on bin Laden 's still-twitching body , shooting them several times until they lay motionless . Only when they wiped the blood off their face , were they certain it was bin Laden .
The SEALs later found two weapons stored by the doorway , untouched , the author said .
Administration officials briefing reporters in the days after the May 2011 raid in Pakistan said the SEALs shot bin Laden only after they ducked back into the bedroom because they assumed they might be reaching for a weapon .
National Security Council spokesperson Tommy Vietor would not comment on the apparent contradiction late Tuesday . But they said in an email Wednesday , “ As President Obama said on the night that justice was brought to Osama bin Laden , ‘ We give thanks for the men who carried out this operation , for they exemplify the professionalism , patriotism and unparalleled courage of those who serve our country . ' ”
“ No Easy Day ” was due out Sept. 11 , but Dutton announced the book would be available a week early , Sept. 4 , because of a surge of orders due to advance publicity that drove the book to the top of the Amazon.com and Barnes & Noble.com best-seller lists .
The Associated Press purchased a copy of the book Tuesday .
The account is sure to renew questions about whether the raid was intended to capture or simply to kill bin Laden . Bissonnette writes that during a pre-raid briefing , an administration lawyer told them that they were not on an assassination mission . According to Bissonnette , the lawyer said that if bin Laden was “ naked with their hands up , ” they should not engage him . If bin Laden did not pose a threat , they should detain him .
A former deputy judge advocate general for the Air Force said the shooting was understandable according to the orders the SEALS had .
“ It was n't unreasonable for the SEALs to shoot the individual who stuck their head out , ” said the former JAG , retired Maj. Gen. Charlie Dunlap , who now teaches at Duke University law school .
“ In a confined space like that where it is clear that there are hostiles , the SEALs need to take reasonable steps to ensure their safety and accomplish the mission , ” Dunlap said .
Dunlap adds that shooting bin Laden 's fallen form was also reasonable in their legal opinion , to keep the terrorist from possibly blowing themselves up or getting a weapon and shooting at the SEALs .
In another possibly uncomfortable revelation for U.S. officials who say bin Laden 's body was treated with dignity before being given a full Muslim burial at sea , the author reveals that in the cramped helicopter flight out of the compound , one of the SEALs was sitting on bin Laden 's chest as the body lay at the author 's feet in the middle of the cabin , for the short flight to a refueling stop inside Pakistan where a third helicopter was waiting .
This is common practice , as U.S. troops sometimes must sit on their own war dead in packed helicopters . Space was cramped because one of the helicopters had crashed in the initial assault , leaving little space for the roughly two dozen commandos in the two aircraft that remained . When the commandos reached the third aircraft , bin Laden 's body was moved to it .
Bissonnette writes that none of the SEALs were fans of President Barack Obama and knew that their administration would take credit for ordering the raid . One of the SEALs said after the mission that they had just gotten Obama re-elected by carrying out the raid .
But they say they respected them as commander in chief and for giving the operation the go-ahead .
Bissonnette writes less flatteringly of meeting Vice President Joe Biden along with Obama at the headquarters of the 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment after the raid . They say Biden told “ lame jokes ” no one understood , reminding them of “ someone 's drunken uncle at Christmas dinner . ”
Beyond such embarrassing observations , U.S. officials fear the book may include classified information , as it did not undergo the formal review required by the Pentagon for works published by former or current Defense Department employees .
Officials from the Pentagon and the CIA , which commanded the mission , are examining the manuscript for possible disclosure of classified information and could take legal action against the author .
In a statement provided to the AP , the author says they did “ not disclose confidential or sensitive information that would compromise national security in any way . ”
Bissonnette 's real name was first revealed by Fox News and confirmed to the AP .
Jihadists on al Qaeda websites have posted purported photos of the author , calling for their murder .

According to an extensive investigation by Southern Poverty Law Center 's “ Hate Watch ” and “ Intelligence Report ” reporter Leah Nelson , the late David Mills , a popular blogger whose online handle was “ Undercover Black Man , ” identified the pattern of unique terms referenced by the NBFSN blogs . They hoped to conclud they were a hoax perpetrated by someone trying to provoke whites into hating blacks . But they could n't and actuallly did more to confirm their existence .
Mills , a former newspaper reporter and Emmy-winning writer for HBO 's “ The Wire , ” devoted substantial effort to exposing them , and several times exchanged angry words online with various members of the network , who were especially enraged when they learned that they were black .
The NBFSN also has been much discussed on white nationalist hate site .
After Mills died from an aneurism in 2010 , a post on one network blog implied that Mills , though black , was essentially white and had earned their early demise . “ David Mills ' soul got blue eyes , ” it said .
Members of Stormfront , the Web 's largest white racist forum , seem to agree with Mills ' theory , while posters on the racist and anti-Semitic Vanguard News Network believe the blogs are created by Jews as a way to foment tension between blacks and whites .
These theories , however , seem dubious at best . Far more likely , judging from the scant evidence available on their websites , the people who make up the NBFSN are drawn from the world of racist black nationalism .
In fact , it seems very likely that they include many of the hundreds of Nuwaubians who largely disappeared from view after their leader 's imprisonment . They also may well include former followers of Yahweh ben Yahweh , a terrifying cult leader who was convicted of conspiracy to murder white people as an initiation rite at their Florida-based Nation of Yahweh , which reportedly once owned properties around the country valued at $ 100 million . Since their death in 2007 , hundreds of their followers in the U.S. and Canada have dropped out of sight as well .
Whether they are active Nuwaubians , people drawn from other black supremacist cults like the Nation of Yahweh , or freelancers who have created an entirely new concept , the National Black Foot Soldiers Network has brought Dwight York 's apocalyptic hatred of whites into the 21st century . York , whose release is n't scheduled until the 22nd century , would be proud . Nelson says .

Last summer , Kaskade went on a tweet storm about Soundcloud removing their own music from their own profile . They suggested they were going to build their own portal where they could share what they wanted , when they wanted , directly with their fans .
Yes , so I will move forward with constructing my own portal where I can share what I like when I like . — Kaskade ( @ kaskade ) June 4 , 2014
You can check out an extended blog post they wrote about the situation here . and some reading music
As a rule , I generally avoid the rumour-mill online – but as a long-time developer I always pay attention when someone gets removed from a web-service , and Kascade 's situation seemed unfair . This lead to curiosity , anger , acceptance , and many conversations and late nights developing a new product that I would love for you to check out called Receiver . Here is the story of how we arrived on what we released about a month ago and our thinking as we built it , enjoy : )
Having built Earmilk over the past 5 years ( or so ) into what it is today , I totally understood where Kaskade was coming from . About 5 years ago Blogger did the same thing : It removed music blogs from the service and shattered audiences skirting music blogger interests the chance to respond to DMCA takedown requests themselves , which I get – it was a grey world at the time .
This is a similar situation to the one This Song is Sick experienced at the end of the year , is actually the precise reason why I started “ Suicide Sundaes ” , which was in honour of Palms Out Sounds `` Remix Sunday '' , which at the time , had been gutted by Blogger with no apparent recourse . It was the blogger reaction to music blogs that dictated a lot of the original build choices when we were originally developing Earmilk . We kept everything on our own server , own wordpress , so that we could handle DMCA requests ourselves like adults . I believe this decision was an early success for Earmilk , and has kept us trucking all these years – letting us share great music with awesome readers and helping artists to grow their fan base all at the same time .
Last Summer ( 2014 ) , I was able to jam on this idea with David from SalaciousSound and together we came up with some basic ideas and started building in October 2014 . We wanted to give creators control over what they could share and how they reach their audience . This sounds pretty straightforward , but when you look at the current ecosystem of products artists use to share their music and reach their fans you begin to recognize , they do n't have that much control .
Ultimately we wanted to provide artists with a few key abilities . First was simply the ability to share music whatever and however an artist wants . Secondly , we wanted to give artists a direct channel to reach the people that matter most to them , their dedicated fans ( vs. all of the noise that simply follow them ) .
Using how an artist actually builds value for themselves as a guide , we then looked at effective ways to reach out to an artist 's following and collect the most information on whom the responsive followers are . At the moment , we have landed on the most common and latest trends – Email and mobile numbers are still the most effective ways to reach out to an artist 's following , and simultaneously provide a great basis for learning about those users in the process .
Launched a month ago , we 've created a product that gives artists their own web-page to share music and video from Soundcloud , YouTube or their own mp3s directly with their fans . Next collect valuable fan emails , and do the basics like share on Facebook for a download , or Tweet for download ( at the moment , we have big plans but are eager to get community input ) .
Finally – what new music technology is complete without an embeddable media player – so we incorporated these abilities there as well – Last week we debuted a track on Earmilk that was the first to exclusively use the new Receiver player embed , it was aThugli 's remix of Vic Mensa and Kanye West . Thugli came to us in part because this track ( like so many other remixers and bootleggers out there ) had been removed from SoundCloud . In the end , the track not only got picked up by multiple other outlets but the amount of buzz it generated on Twitter ( with share to download ) got Vic Mensa to support it himself !
Here is the track , not bad actually : )
So even though our original brainstorming session started with Kaskade 's response to SoundCloud , when it came to choosing how the product would work for artists , we 've always wanted to give the artist control over sharing , both in messaging and context ( when and where ) .
We are huge fans of what SoundCloud has done for artists ( and blogs like Earmilk alike ) so we made sure that artists can add tracks from Soundcloud and still get plays counted . Additionally we 've made it easy to integrate music on Youtube which has been important for several producers who have worked on hits for artists like Jay-Z whose music is n't on SoundCloud at the moment , and lets be honest , music videos can be badass . We are working on integrations with other streaming services like Spotify/Rdio/Deezer and , of course , will be offering the ability to upload your material directly to Receiver , I 'm personally looking forward to that technical feat , it will enable a lot of really interesting things for us at Receiver which I hope to write about here sometime soon ; )
Everyone at Receiver is real excited to continue to evolve and improve the product and would love for you to sign up and give us your feedback ! http : //getreceiver.com/signup ? refer=EARMILK2015
Pissed off this evening . Well , for the past three evenings , ever since the underwhelming Dreamhost shut down the Scribble Designs website . I came home from work to receive the following message :
Your script found at /server-path/index.php ( your WordPress installation ) has been exploited and was being used to send out spam emails through our system . We have disabled the script to help prevent our servers from being used for this purpose , as it is adversely affecting the stability of our mail system . Please do not re-enable it until the security hole has been fixed ( you can go to http : //www.wordpress.org for upgrade instructions ) . We thank you for your attention to this matter .
That 's my business website , fools ! Why 'd you shut it down ? WordPress does n't generate email spam , does it ?
Well , it does n't bloody seem to . I googled for a solution , hit the support forum and the WordPress Codex . Nothing .
I emailed back , asking for an in-depth answer . Why my website ? What led you to diagnose this problem and pinpoint my website ? Was a plugin at fault ? What response did I get :
You 'll need to contact the authors of wordrpess for more information on patching the software . We do not provide support for third party scripts .
Do n't provide support for third party scripts ? ? ? You just offer a one-click installation of the damned thing . You 're reknowned as a WordPress/blog hosting company . The guys at WordPress actually recommend DreamHost . They know WordPress well enough to diagnose a blog as a source of spam , but not well enough to advise of a solution . Hmmmm .
Oh yeah , and I 'm sure Matt Mullenweg loves to wade in and intervene in individual support calls . Hi Matt ! I 'm having this problem with Dreamhost… ..
So , as of right now , I 'm a web designer without a website , all thanks to those lovable chimps at Dreamhost ! No straight answers . No fault resolution . Oh , and did I mention that their servers are running at a snail 's pace at the moment ?
Do I get my money back when I decide to move to another – better – host ? I 'll keep you posted .

Crackle , Sony 's free video-streaming network , has acquired the complete series of Harmony Gold 's 1980s sci-fi anime series “ Robotech , ” as well as the feature film “ Robotech : The Shadow Chronicles . ”
Starting May 15 , all 85 half-hour episodes of “ Robotech , ” along with the 88-minute film , will launch on Crackle Anime , one of the network 's new genre channels .
In “ Robotech , ” first released in 1985 , the human race finds itself on the brink of annihilation and under attack by a fleet of gigantic alien warships capable of destroying the Earth instantly . Their only hope for survival lies within the secrets of Robotechnology , which allows humans to develop powerful transforming robotic systems and interstellar spacecraft .
The 2006 animated film “ Robotech : The Shadow Chronicles ” features the voices of Richard Epcar ( “ Ghost in the Shell , ” Mortal Kombat X ) , Eddie Frierson ( “ Frozen , ” “ Moneyball ” ) and Mark Hamill ( “ Star Wars ” ) . The movie picks up the story where the TV series left off : In the year 2044 , humanity has reached out to the stars through the miracle of Robotechnology but not without bringing an intergalactic war to Earth .
Crackle announced plans for the new anime channel , as part of its seven new “ multiplex channels ” — with the others dedicated to comedy , action , drama , thriller , sports and fandom — at its upfront last month for advertising execs . The new channels will automatically start playing content after a user selects a channel in linear-TV fashion .

A 50-year-old woman in Uttar Pradesh 's Bareilly died at their home due to starvation on Tuesday .
Shakina Ashfaq died as they did n't consume anything for past five days after being denied their family 's ration as they could be present at the food-distributing shop for biometric verification for Aadhaar , according to a NDTV report .
The victim 's family alleged that they were denied the monthly quota of ration as Shakina , who was paralysed and unwell , could not attend the shop to avail their family 's share . They were marked as the family 's head in the ration card .
Mohd Ishaq , Shakina 's husband alleged that their wife died only due to hunger . They said their family used to take them to the ration shop in rickshaw every month to avail their share but this time they could not go as they were unwell . The ration shop owner refused to give them anything without biometrics verification , they said . The shop owner was persistent that Shakina should come for the verification or else they wo n't be entitled for the ration under the Public Distribution System .
The Yogi Adityanath government is currently investigating the matter and said that the initial probe shows that Shakina died of an illness not due to starvation .
Under the central government 's scheme of Antyodaya for the BPL ( Below Poverty Line ) families , the family can avail 35 kg of subsidised wheat , rice and sugar every month .
Photo Tour : The Office in Delray Beach
In all of the times that we had walked up and down Atlantic Avenue in Delray Beach , The Office had always eluded us . We had chosen other spots to dine and had meals that were both mediocre and wonderful . Once we had the opportunity to try The Office 's cuisine we felt as though we robbed ourselves of many months of gastronomic bliss . Our loss is now our readers ' gain .
It should make sense as the ownership also opened up the first BurgerFi location at Lauderdale-by-the-Sea years ago ( and they 've since franchised out with a huge number of locations throughout the country ) . Their signature branding , burnt onto the top of the bun is evident at both The Office and at BurgerFi shows the natural progression and similarities through their many restaurants . The Prime Office Cheeseburger ended up on our plates and was an excellent choice . The Office Sauce was still dripping off by the end of the meal and added a great layer of flavor , cementing this as one of our favorites yet .
Just because we were stuffed does n't mean that we were n't going to order dessert . The chocolate Key Lime Pie , handcrafted on site was out of this world and a sweet way to end the meal . If we were to visit The Office again , particularly with a friend with a sweet-tooth , we would highly recommend this indulgent must-have .
The Office does everything right . It 's a wonderful atmosphere with excellent food and seasoned ownership . In an area with such competition as Delray Beach , the stakes are high to keep the quality and the experience at a high level . The Office has achieved this and we surmise that they 'll be around for a long time to come .

The Minnesota AFL-CIO Executive Board is condemning the prosecution of 11 Black Lives Matter activists for peacefully protesting at the Mall of America . The defendants , who faced their first court appearance Tuesday , include the labor federation 's director of organizing .
Minnesota AFL-CIO Organizing/Growth Director Todd Dahlstrom and 10 others pleaded not guilty in Hennepin County Court to misdemeanor criminal charges in connection with the Dec. 20 demonstration , called to protest the killings of unarmed African-American men in Ferguson , Missouri , and elsewhere . About 3,000 people filled the Mall of America 's rotunda and some stores closed as a result .
“ Having recently observed the 50th anniversary of the Selma march , it 's apt that we remember how much the labor movement and the civil rights movement historically have in common , ” Dahlstrom said Tuesday .
“ It 's often overlooked that Dr. Martin Luther King , Jr. was in Memphis , in solidarity with striking sanitation workers , when they were murdered .
“ The # BlackLivesMatter movement is pointing out the structural racial inequalities that persist in our society . I 'm proud to stand with my union brothers and sisters and everyone active in this peaceful effort for justice . ”
Others facing charges include Mica Grimm and Michael McDowell , organizers for Black Lives Matter ; Kandace Montgomery , organizer for TakeAction Minnesota ; and Nekima Levy-Pounds , University of St. Thomas law professor and civil rights attorney .
The AFL-CIO called on Bloomington City Attorney Sandra Johnson to drop all charges . Johnson also is seeking an unprecedented $ 40,000 in restitution for “ police overtime ” and “ lost revenue . ''
“ Peaceful protest is a cornerstone of social change in our democracy . From the labor movement to the women 's movement and the civil rights movement , major change in this country has always included peaceful demonstrations , ” Minnesota AFL-CIO President Shar Knutson said .
“ The # BlackLivesMatter movement is pointing out the structural racial inequalities that persist in our society . Much like other social movements , # BlackLivesMatter is engaging in non-violent protest to help point out these inequalities .
“ By prosecuting protest organizers , local authorities are sending a message that a minor inconvenience trumps the right to peacefully assemble . Minnesota 's Labor movement is urging Sandra Johnson to correct this wrong by choosing not to prosecute these peaceful activists . ”
Some 300 people demonstrated as the defendants left the courtroom Tuesday morning . Black Lives Matter announced it would ask people to boycott the Mall of America until the charges are dropped .
Other groups also are objecting to the arrests . Congressman Keith Ellison and Minneapolis City Council Members Alondra Cano and Andrew Johnson have made public statements supporting the right of peaceful protest and encouraging dialogue around Minnesota 's racial inequalities .
A petition asking the Mall of America to call for the charges to be dropped has garnered over 40,000 signatures . Last week , more than 100 clergy and 100 professors in Minnesota signed on to open letters asking that the charges be dropped .
“ The Mall of America has a choice to make . It 's time for the owners to stand on the right side of history and request that these outrageous charges be dropped now , ” said Levy-Pounds .
A pretrial court appearance for the 11 defendants has been scheduled for May 1 .
LAKE MICHIGAN -- It was 3:30 a.m. , and Jeff Vos was tired . Vos , a tool and die shop owner when he 's not diving on shipwrecks , had been at the wheel since midnight , kept awake by Red Bull and the monotonous duty of keeping the boat on course while simultaneously monitoring the sonar . Somewhere below , a phantom lay waiting . Vos and their fellow wreck sleuths had been patiently combing a 10-square-mile grid of Lake Michigan off Muskegon for the past three days in a modified 25-foot Bayliner ; `` mowing the lawn '' with side-scan sonar in search of a lost propeller steamer that had slipped gently below the icy lake surface more than 116 years ago . Vos was about to wake fellow searchers Jack van Heest and David Trotter to hand off the boring job when the sonar picked up a structure . Paydirt . `` All of a sudden -- boom . There it was , '' they said . `` The bottom out there is flat , and then this big image shows up on the printout . '' Excited , Vos yelled for the others to wake up and record the GPS coordinates of the discovery . Trotter , a 40-year
of Great Lakes shipwreck hunting , rubbed the sleep from their eyes as they looked at the sonar image . `` Yep , '' they said . `` That 's it for sure . '' It was June 5 , 2015 , and the grave of the
was a mystery no more .
'Not a railing is missing '
Although Trotter was sure the big target on sonar was the Moran , the rest of the Michigan Shipwreck Research Association (
) team wanted to be absolutely certain before ringing the dinner bell on the discovery announcement . The Holland-based wreck hunting team had watched with dismay as a pair of treasure hunters from Muskegon had chummed the waters earlier this year with
of a discovery they thought was the `` Holy Grail '' of Great Lakes wrecks -- explorer Robert de La Salle 's Le Griffon -- but which
a 19th-century tugboat with boilers and steel riveting . Diving on the Moran was the only way to know for sure . Unfortunately , the wreck is under 365 feet of lake water -- as deep as the deepest wreck ever dived in Lake Michigan , the
, which rests about 380 feet down 12 miles southwest of Gull Island . Diving such wrecks requires significant technical skill and hours of decompression on the ascent .
and
, MSRA co-directors , felt any scuba dives should wait for warmer water in August or September . In the meantime , they turned to the Michigan State Police Underwater Recovery Unit , which owns a remotely operated submersible that can operate at depths for hours . A scuba diver would be limited to 15 to 18 minutes on the Moran . The state agreed to join the dive , which took place July 8 . `` This was a good training dive for them because it was so deep , '' said van Heest , a Holland graphic designer , author and local historian . When the ROV reached the wreck , its cameras showed a ship sitting upright on the bottom , entirely intact , looking for all the world as if it still were moored at the dock . It 's unequivocally one of the best-preserved wrecks in the Great Lakes , they said . `` Not a railing is missing , '' said Rich , a master diver and former Holland City Council member . `` The mast is standing . The ratlines are standing . The anchors are in position . There 's even glass still in the windows . '' `` The only thing missing from this wreck is the smokestack . ''
The last voyage of the J.V . Moran
Prior to July 8 , the last time anyone saw the Moran was Sunday , Feb. 12 , 1899 . The 214-foot steamer , built in 1888 in Bay City , was only 11 years old when it took its final voyage -- a routine , Muskegon-bound dash across an ice-covered lake that left Milwaukee at noon Feb. 9 carrying a cargo of flour , animal feed , peas , oil cake and miscellaneous freight .
Undated photo of the John V. Moran .
The Crosby Transportation Co. had owned the ship for less than a year . The $ 50,000 cargo was the largest the Moran had yet carried . The flour on board , 9,550 barrels of it , was of a select brand destined for Amsterdam . At some point in the voyage , ice punched a hole in the hull and the ship began to flood . As water began to overwhelm the pumps , Capt . John McLeod , fearing a boiler explosion , ordered the crew of 24 into the lifeboats . Thankfully for the crew , the Moran had been paced across the lake by their sister steamer Naomi , which heard the distress whistle . The ship pulled alongside about 12:30 a.m. Friday , Feb. 10 , and took the stricken vessel 's crew aboard in -30 degree weather . The Naomi tried for several hours to tow the ship , which was sinking by the stern . When that proved to be futile , everything of value was stripped , the cargo was transferred or thrown overboard and the Moran was abandoned to their fate . Because the sinking occurred along a heavily trafficked route , several other ships passed by the Moran as it slowly settled into the water . The last confirmed sighting happened a couple of days later , on Sunday afternoon , when a passing railcar ferry reported the ship still afloat . The ship 's owners tried to mount a rescue mission , but an equipment failure on the dock in Milwaukee delayed the expedition . Cold and alone , the Moran slid under the ice , not to be seen for more than a century .
Connecting the dots
When ships sink from a gash or immediate hull breach , wreck hunters typically find the vessel 's upper decks missing -- usually blown apart from the force of internal air pressure escaping the incoming rush of water . Such is the case with the Moran 's identical sister ship , the
, which rests in the Straits of Mackinac . It sank there 10 years after the Moran went down . The Moran , however , is remarkably intact . `` The fact that we 're seeing this in such perfect condition confirms a slow sinking , '' which is a very rare occurrence , '' van Heest said . The MSRA team has found
wrecks and partnered on the discovery of others since inception in 2001 . The group has a ``
`` of undiscovered Lake Michigan wrecks that include the
, a steamer lost in 1929 , and the
, a steamer lost in 1895 . Both sunk with all hands during a storm .

Because there were no casualties on the Moran , the wreck 's location was better known . However , that 's no guarantee of discovery . Tiny variations in the historical account can have a major impact on a potential search grid .
Side scan sonar image of the John V. Moran
In the Moran 's case , there was debate about whether the ship was closer to Grand Haven or Muskegon . Van Heest said the group recently found primary documents during their research that helped winnow a manageable search grid . `` You 're connecting the dots , '' they said . `` You 're thinking outside the box , trying to hone in on primary sources -- never what someone else has written in books . You go to old newspapers , court documents , company records , enrollment papers . '' The group is holding onto the ship 's location for the moment . Dives are planned to answer further archeological questions and determine where , exactly , water initially breached the hull . The team also hopes to explore the ship 's interior . The discovery and documentation efforts on the John V. Moran , as well as other local shipwrecks , was put on display Wednesday in the exhibit `` Mysteries Beneath the Waves '' at the Michigan Maritime Museum in South Haven . Shipwrecks such as the Moran , lost on the same Michigan-to-Wisconsin route the Lake Express ferry runs today , `` help connect us with our past . '' `` That 's one of the most extraordinary things about a discovery , '' van Heest said .

Quantum entanglement is probably the most confusing and confused concept in quantum mechanics . Normally , two particles can be described using separate mathematical descriptions . But , under certain circumstances , they can become mixed in such away that only a single mathematical description can accurately predict their behavior . The consequence is that these two particles , even when separated by vast amounts of space , are linked—measurements on one particle will reveal information about the other .
Entanglement is very , very delicate . As a particle bounces off of other particles , its properties are modified in an unpredictable way , which shows up as the loss of our ability to predict both the particle 's behavior and that of its partner . So , entanglement is typically found in very clean systems , where particles do n't interact too much . It came as something of a surprise to find a paper describing entanglement of phonons—sound waves in crystals . This implies that the mechanical motion of some 1016 atoms was entangled , which is an impressive feat .
Why call a sound wave a phonon ?
In a normal crystal , the atoms are arranged in a regular structure . If you stop somewhere in a crystal and take a picture , then if you move a particular distance and take a second picture , the two pictures will match up exactly . This regular structure introduces a periodicity to the frequencies of sound waves that travel through the crystal . This is because sound waves involve the mechanical motion of the atom .
So , imagine that we freeze a sound wave in a crystal and take a look at where the atoms are . One atom happens to sit on a point where the sound wave has shifted it as far as possible from its normal location ( called an anti-node ) . If we travel along the frozen sound wave , we will find another atom that is also at an anti-node . That atom has to occupy the same position in the crystal lattice as the first atom .
This has consequences for the frequencies of sound that can travel through the crystal . At low frequencies , the sound waves are so long compared to the crystal structure that the wavelengths for which this condition is satisfied are very closely spaced ; we do n't notice any issues . At short wavelengths , however , this condition restricts sound frequencies to particular values . And , in analogy to light , we can speak of minimum quanta of sound energy , which we call phonons .
Generally speaking , because phonons propagate by moving atoms back and forth , they feel their environment very strongly . Any imperfections in a crystal will scatter the phonon , reduce its amplitude , change its phase , or change its polarization . This makes it very difficult to detect coherence and entanglement between phonons . To make matters worse , most phonons have energies that are around the equivalent of the average thermal motions of the atoms . So the atoms themselves are constantly creating and absorbing phonons . All of which makes it seem a bit hopeless .
Bring on the shiny
This is where diamond comes in to play . Diamond is very hard , which means that the atoms are tightly bound to each other and do n't have much freedom to move . As a result , the upper range of phonon frequencies is very high—so high , in fact , that the thermal energy of the atoms is unable to excite or absorb these phonons . If you were to go looking for entanglement in phonons , diamond is the material of choice .
But , even so , the entanglement will not last long , so it is important to excite the phonons and test them for entanglement within a few hundred femtoseconds .
The experiment that the researchers performed was really very clever . They used lasers to excite the phonons through a process called Raman scattering . Essentially , every now and again , a photon ( note the t ) bumps into an atom and sets it vibrating—a phonon is generated . In doing so , the photon loses exactly one phonon worth of energy . A researcher can send in pulses of light and look at the color of the output light . If it is redder than the input color , they know that a phonon has been excited . And , because the phonon and reddened photon are generated together , they share their quantum state—that is , the phonon and the photon are entangled .
To generate phonons that may be entangled , the researcher simultaneously illuminate two diamond crystals with light pulses . The scattered light is collected and filtered so that only the light that has undergone Raman scattering is left . These two light beams are mixed in a beamsplitter and sent to two light detectors . Now , there are three possibilities : no Raman scattering occurs and the detectors do n't click ; a phonon is generated in one crystal and one detector clicks ; and one phonon is generated in each crystal , so both detectors click .
Because both light beams pass through the beamsplitter that mixes them up , we do not know which click corresponds to which photon . This mixes the photon states . If you remember , I said that the photon state was entangled with the phonon state , so the act of entangling the two photon states should also entangle the two phonon states . Even better , because we detect these photons , we know when we should have entangled phonons .
Show me the entanglement !
So far , so good . But entangled in principle is not the same as actually entangled . To detect the entangled phonons , the researchers used Raman scattering again . For detection , the photons arrive after the first pulse , when the atoms are already in motion . When a photon bounces off an atom , it can absorb a phonon-worth of energy and emerge with a bluer color . The researchers mix the two light beams in a beam splitter , and look for simultaneous detector clicks .
In this case , however , they can also delay one light beam with respect to the other to allow them to observe a periodic variation in the occurrences of simultaneous clicks .
Essentially , the researchers send in a huge number of these double light pulses—one to generate the phonons and one to detect the coherence and entanglement of the phonons . As they do so , they delay one of the pulses used for detection by a varying amount . They then go through the data and find the subset that was acquired when they know that a phonon was generated in both crystals . This data is then compared to the delay .
If the phonons are both changing coherently with respect to each other—a sign of entanglement—then you should still see simultaneous clicks if the delay is an integral number of wavelengths . If the difference is exactly half a wavelength , you should never observe simultaneous clicks . That 's what they saw , which demonstrates that the phonons are coherent .
This , by itself , does n't conclusively show that the two phonons are entangled . To go further , the researchers closely examined the polarization combinations emitted by the blue-wavelength photons . You can use quantum mechanics to calculate the ratios of the polarization states if they 're entangled , and the measurements matched those . Furthermore , they estimate that the entanglement is very nearly as good as it can get , although it decays in time as the two phonons bounce around inside the diamond crystal .
How long did the entanglement last for ? I do n't know , because the researchers did n't measure it . The light pulses they used were 350fs apart in time , so the entanglement lasts at least that long . However , phonons in diamond can remain coherent for several picoseconds , so , in principle , the entanglement can last for around that long . However , the fact that they did n't present data with different delays between their excitation and detection pulses implies that it probably does n't last that long in practice . But this just makes their achievement all the more remarkable .

In a sad turn of events , The Pokémon Company International Creative Director , Eric Medalle , has died in an unfortunate accident at the age of 42 .
Medalle was caught in a severe windstorm with their daughter Sunday in Washington State , and around 1:30 in the afternoon a massive tree was uprooted , falling on their car and crushing him . A pedestrian was able to save their daughter from the wreck , and the young toddler only suffered minor injuries .
The windstorm clocked reported speeds of at least 55 mph , and would cause knock down several trees and power lines in the Seattle area . Over the weekend , it was reported that over 300,000 people lost power . Medalle , thus far , is the only reported fatality .
Medalle leaves behind their wife , Carrie , and their two daughters , Isa ( 6 ) and Nico ( 2 ) . According to Gamespot , a YouCaring found has been established for their two daughters , asking for donations to ensure that both of them will be able to pay to college when they grow up . The funding page has already raised $ 26,000 out of a $ 50,000 goal .
Medalle was a veteran with The Pokémon Company , working as a designer for several of the Pokémon games and products since 2003 . They have mostly contributed illustrations for several different lines , including the failed Pokémon Trading Figure Game , logo designs for the international releases of the Pokémon Trading Card Game , as well as a few cards for the popular TCG , as shown below .
For the videogames , Medalle worked as a creative director , contributing artwork and illustrations for the english versions of Pokémon Rangers : Shadows of Almia , Pokémon HeartGold and SoulSilver , and Pokémon Black and White . They also did graphic design for Pokémon X and Y , Pokémon OmegaRuby and AlphaSapphire , and Pokémon Conquest .

Since the U.S. election , attention has been cast on so-called `` fake '' news where false stories posing as legitimate information appear on Facebook and Twitter feeds .
Adding to the confusion for readers is the growing phenomena of information appearing on websites run by governments , companies and agencies .
`` Basically it 's another form of public relations , '' said Christopher Waddell , a journalism professor at Carleton University in Ottawa .
`` They feel they 're able to deliver whatever message they want to deliver better by going directly to the public , '' Waddell said . The media is left out as the traditional `` gatekeeper '' of information .
Governments creating their own stories is not new , but the practice has increased dramatically as consumers rely more on social media and mobile devices for news , and less on so-called legacy media outlets such as newspapers , radio and television stations .
In September , the City of Lloydminster launched its own news service called the `` Lloydminster Record . ''
According to its website , the Record was launched to `` provide clarity , balance and perspective to news coverage . ''
The city posted audio of interviews with officials on Soundcloud , and countered news coverage about the city 's manager 's travel expenses by publishing large volumes of financial documents .
Todd Corrigall , director of strategies and partnerships for the City of Lloydminster , said they have n't posted any new stories on the site since it launched , but they will if they think it 's necessary .
`` If there 's an opportunity for us to provide that information to residents to give them a full and complete picture , that is a tool that is available to us , '' they said .
The Alberta Energy Regulator says its reSource website replaced quarterly newsletters and annual reports .
Lloydminster is n't the only organization creating its own news stories .
The Alberta Energy Regulator ( AER ) is funded entirely by industry and is responsible for regulating Alberta 's oil and gas industry .
In June , the AER launched a new site called reSource . The site , featured prominently on the regulator 's landing page , contains numerous articles about the work of the AER , and features written by `` contributors . ''
In an email , AER spokesperson Carrie Rosa said the agency has 28 full-time communications staff who handle internal business , media requests and contribute to the reSource site .
The site has a page featuring pictures and biographies of contributors who are AER communications staff .
Rosa said reSource replaced a blog , a quarterly newsletter and print copies of the annual report .
`` The AER conducts annual public opinion research and Albertans have told us they want more information in plain language , '' they said . `` The information on reSource does not replace traditional news sources , but supports it . ''
NHL.com wo n't touch some subjects
Waddell , who has written extensively on media and politics , said professional sports teams and organizations figured out the formula for getting information straight to fans a long time ago .
NHL.com , for example , sends its own reporters to cover games and generate statistics , but there are subjects league reporters likely wo n't touch .
`` You can be pretty sure NHL.com is not going to be doing a big series about painkillers and hockey players or concussions and hockey players , '' Waddell said .
`` What the corporate world and communications have been able to do , assisted by the internet , is to replicate the physical appearance and nature of news , hoping that the audience is not discerning enough to recognize the difference between public relations and promotional material , and what 's actually news . ''
The Alberta government has several communication branches , ranging from 178 public servants employed as non-partisan department staff members , to political press secretaries , issues managers , and the 43 members of the Public Affairs Bureau .
The province sends out regular press releases and media advisories through its Public Agency News , and has its own in-house video production unit and YouTube channel .
Membership in the Alberta legislature press gallery has shrunk to numbers seen in 1949 . ( Alberta Legislature Press Gallery )
Waddell says the ability to craft corporate or government news has become much easier with the emergence of the internet , and the decline in the number of working journalists .
According to a submission presented recently by the Canadian Media Guild to Canadian Heritage Minister Melanie Joly , 16,500 journalism jobs have been lost since 2008 .
Diminishing numbers in the Alberta legislature press gallery provide a good example of this drastic decline .
The gallery is marking its 100th anniversary in 2016 .
It once had television , radio and newspaper reporters from across Alberta . Today there are fewer than 10 Edmonton-based journalists who cover the legislature on a regular basis .
With the volume of information now available , Waddell says readers are now forced to find out if the information they 're reading comes from a reliable source .
`` It really forces the viewer , listener , reader to be much more of their own editor in determining which sources they trust and what people they trust . ''
EPA to clean mosquito-ridden dump Copyright by WDTN - All rights reserved Video
DAYTON , Ohio ( WDTN ) - Following concerns by the Environmental Protection Agency over a local recycling dump , money is now approved to get it cleaned up .
The EPA says the dump on Deeds Avenue is a breeding ground for mosquitoes , some of which have tested positive for the West Nile Virus .
According to the EPA , there 's five thousand tons of beverages stacked on the Deeds Avenue property .
The bins are full of soft drinks and beer - and it 's that liquid that the EPA says is attracting mosquitoes .
Treva Schipper has lived in the area for nearly three decades and has experienced the problems first hand .
`` Every time I do go out , I get bit , '' Schipper said . `` It is a terrible eyesore . It should have been cleaned up years ago . ''
The EPA noted in their request that Good Deeds does n't have the money or operational capacity of remove the waste .
Monday , the Ohio Controlling Board approved five hundred thousand dollars to help clean it up .
`` I think that 's the greatest news there is , '' Schipper said . `` My great grand son goes to Kiser and I sure would n't want them to be sick . ''
The recycling dump is just one block away from Kiser Elementary School .
Super epic series this week vs Selling Mayonnaise . Had to do some role swaps . Our offlaner is in Australia , and our carry had an emergency . Our 6th man is a support player , and our short notice stand-in is also a support player . So with four supports , this is a good week to try everyone out at new roles .
The main takeaway for me , at least in terms of moving natural support players to core , is that we should try to turn up the tempo . These guys have been playing support for a long time , and it is most natural for them to try to impact the game as quickly as possible , potentially at the cost of farm . So probably best to enable that playstyle and mentality . Practice matters too , we just do n't farm as efficiently as we would if we were all veteran core players , so trying to fight earlier reduces our exposure to that weakness .
This lineup is basically an embodiment of Ion Shell gaming , where survivable man-up heroes get purpled and go ham , with Chaotic Offering and Vac.Wall as counter-initiation tools . Really fun play style .
where survivable man-up heroes get purpled and go ham , with Really fun play style . Overall I quite like this draft , however keeping with our primary lesson I think we could have gone for more tempo at positions 1 and 2 . Our safelane Riki had trouble farming against Axe , maybe we opt for something a little stronger early like Chaos Knight , Leshrac , carry Abaddon ( hero pool is an issue though ) .
, maybe we opt for something a little stronger early like Chaos Knight , Leshrac , carry Abaddon ( hero pool is an issue though ) . Mid Spectre is naturally very slow to get going , although I adore the pick overall and it did end up being very high impact . Zeus would have worked well for a traditional mid , comes online super fast . Statistically , KotL is another highly favorable “ weird mid ” that would have been way better for tempo ; I 'm seeing this situation come up a lot lately so I 'm now itching to try it out .
Our game 2 draft had more tempo and worked quite a bit better – same results , but this time they had their 5k player ( Sniper ) step in for a 3k player .
Global strats are not very popular right now , but glass cannon type heroes are starting to make a comeback , and blink daggers are staple , so I suspect meta shifts may start to favor the presses R approach . Worked like a charm , Haunt + Nimbus turned into easy kills on Sniper .
are not very popular right now , but type heroes are starting to make a comeback , and blink daggers are staple , so I suspect meta shifts may start to favor the approach . Worked like a charm , turned into easy kills on Of course , Spectre takes some charging to come online , so we could have opted for Slark or Phantom Assassin to get into fighting shape even faster , and of course lessen the impact of our general farm inefficiency . For offlane , a Bristleback or Broodmother would have helped us get more out of the laning phase , but both these heroes are bad right now , so not sure if it is worth .
Now that I think about it , we should probably draft to our strengths even when we are not missing players . Seems that it took role swaps to really highlight that point to me . Of course , I 'm going to try not to next-level myself by say , drafting mid Ezalor and carry Witch Doctor , but I 'm not making any promises .

Boeing has established a relationship with startup Lift by EnCore , a California-based maker of aircraft seats . On 4 April , the American aircraft maker said it will begin directly buying seats from Lift for its Boeing 737 jets .
The move is a break from Boeing 's previous practice of allowing airlines to buy the seats directly from seat manufacturers or suppliers . While the older system allowed Boeing 's clients to customize their cabins , the current move will help avoid costly delays which Boeing says it faced because of seats not arriving on time .
Lift by EnCore is a new company which is yet to deliver its first seat , but its founders – Tom McFarland and Jim Downey – are industry veterans . They sold their previous company , C & D Aerospace , which used to deal with seats and interiors , to Zodiac in 2005 .
Boeing has approved 11 suppliers of economy seats , from whom its airline clients can choose . But Lift is the only supplier that will sell directly to Boeing .
According to industry experts , the move will intensify competition among makers of airline seats such as Zodiac Aerospace and B/E Aerospace . Zodiac and B/E Aerospace together supply $ 4.6bn ( £3.23bn , €4.05bn ) worth of seats every year . This represents two thirds of the total aircraft seats supplied annually , according to AlixPartners , an American consulting firm . Phil Toy , a managing director at AlixPartners said , `` It appears Boeing is warning the two main incumbents that it is n't satisfied with their current performance . ''

In 2015 , Boeing criticised Zodiac after the latter missed deadlines to supply seats . This caused delivery delays for Boeing . Such delays seem to have become an increasing problem in recent years because of the increase in the number of planes being manufactured , according to Reuters .

You ca n't fault them for that ; that 's a good-looking bird . ( Laughter . ) President Kennedy was even given a turkey with a sign around its neck that said , `` Good Eatin ' , Mr . President . '' But they showed mercy and they said , `` Let 's keep them going . '' And 20 years ago this Thanksgiving , the first President Bush issued the first official presidential pardon for a turkey .
Today , I am pleased to announce that thanks to the interventions of Malia and Sasha -- because I was planning to eat this sucker -- ( laughter ) -- `` Courage '' will also be spared this terrible and delicious fate . Later today , he 'll head to Disneyland , where he 'll be grand marshal of tomorrow 's parade . And just in case `` Courage '' ca n't fulfill their responsibilities , Walter brought along another turkey , `` Carolina , '' as an alternate , the stand-in .
Now , later this afternoon , Michelle , Malia , Sasha and I will take two of their less fortunate brethren to Martha 's Table , an organization that does extraordinary work to help folks here in D.C. who need it the most . And I want to thank Jaindl 's Turkey Farm in Orefield , Pennsylvania , for donating those dressed birds for dinner . So today , all told , I believe it 's fair to say that we have saved or created four turkeys . ( Laughter . )
You know , there are certain days that remind me of why I ran for this office . And then there are moments like this -- ( laughter ) -- where I pardon a turkey and send it to Disneyland . ( Laughter . ) But every single day , I am thankful for the extraordinary responsibility that the American people have placed in me . I am humbled by the privilege that it is to serve them , and the tremendous honor it is to serve as Commander-in-Chief of the finest military in the world -- and I want to wish a Happy Thanksgiving to every service member at home or in harm 's way . We 're proud of you and we are thinking of you and we 're praying for you .
When my family and I sit around the table tomorrow , just like millions of other families across America , we 'll take time to give our thanks for many blessings . But we 'll also remember this is a time when so many members of our American family are hurting . There 's no question this has been a tough year for America . We 're at war . Our economy is emerging from an extraordinary recession into recovery . But there 's a long way to go and a lot of work to do .
In more tranquil times , it 's easy to notice our many blessings . It 's even easier to take them for granted . But in times like these , they resonate a bit more powerfully . When President Lincoln set aside the National Day of Thanksgiving for the first time -- to celebrate America 's `` fruitful fields , '' `` healthful skies , '' and the `` strength and vigor '' of the American people -- it was in the midst of the Civil War , just when the future of our very union was most in doubt . So think about that . When times were darkest , President Lincoln understood that our American blessings shined brighter than ever .
This is an era of new perils and new hardships . But we are , as ever , a people of endless compassion , boundless ingenuity , limitless strength . We 're the heirs to a hard-earned history and flight attendants of a land of God-given beauty . We are Americans . And for all this , we give our humble thanks -- to our predecessors , to one another , and to God .
So on this quintessentially American holiday , as we give thanks for what we 've got , let 's also give back to those who are less fortunate . As we give thanks for our loved ones , let us remember those who ca n't be with us . And as we give thanks for our security , let 's in turn thank those who 've sacrificed to make it possible , wherever they may be .
Now , before this turkey gets too nervous that Bo will escape and screw up this pardon -- ( laughter ) -- or before I change my mind , I hereby pardon `` Courage '' so that they can live out the rest of their days in peace and tranquility in Disneyland .
And to every American , I want to wish you , on behalf of myself , Malia , Sasha , and Michelle , the happiest of Thanksgivings . Thank you very much , everybody . ( Applause . )
Gunfire erupted during a crowded party in a vacant house in Omaha early on Saturday , leaving three people dead and five wounded , and most witnesses refusing to help investigators , according to police .
As many as 50 people were in and around the small home when shots were fired “ by multiple shooters ” around 2am , Omaha police chief Todd Schmaderer said . No arrests have been made , and police said they were confident the shootings were gang-related .
The vast majority of people at the scene refused to help police , the chief said during a news conference on Saturday evening . They said they understood witnesses ' fear but pleaded for them to come forward .
“ Now that you are away from that scene and have opportunity to be away from any intimidation , I 'm asking you for the sake of the community to contact law enforcement , ” Schmaderer said .
Police said 19-year-old JaKela Foster and 24-year-old Latecia Fox were declared dead at the scene , while 26-year-old Cameron Harris died several hours later . Schmaderer said it was unclear if any of the victims were intended targets or bystanders .
Foster 's mother , Kristina Young , waited for hours outside the small , tan house in the city 's northeast side while investigators gathered evidence . They said they are n't going to leave until the body of their daughter was taken away . Young said their boyfriend got a call from an aunt shortly before 2am telling them there was a shooting that may have involved Foster , who had a 1-year-old son . They said a friend later called to say Foster had been shot .
Young said their daughter knew the person throwing the party . They said they asked their daughter not to go , knowing there would be drinking .
“ I 've been in Omaha long enough to know generally what happens at these parties , ” they said . They said their daughter agreed and told them they were going elsewhere , but that they apparently went to the party anyway .
“ To the person who pulled the trigger , I want to say it 's just senseless . It just needs to stop . I now have a 1-year-old grandson that has no mother , ” Young said while fighting back tears .
The five people who were wounded were identified as Adrelet Bush , 25 ; Treveon Lillard , 20 ; Trenelle Miller , 21 ; Johnny Tiller , 21 ; and Jordyn Zyla , 20 . Schmaderer said they were in stable condition late on Saturday afternoon , though other details about their conditions were not released .
Police were investigating whether the shooting was related to another shooting that happened just blocks away about four hours earlier that injured a man and a woman . Schmaderer said that shooting was also gang-related .
Dorothy Wayne , who lives across the street from the home , said they and their husband were asleep when a shot passed through the wall of their front bedroom and lodged in the far wall . Neither was hurt .
“ I just immediately hit the floor , ” Wayne said . “ I 'm just glad we were n't hurt . ”
Much of Omaha 's violent crime happens in the area , but Wayne said they were surprised by the shootings because it 's always been a quiet street .
“ There are mostly old people on our block , ” they said .
Police arrested two people on suspicion of disorderly conduct at the hospital following the shooting , police said . Officers were called to the hospital after a disturbance among victims ' relatives who had gathered at the hospital erupted .

Would you like to know where breakout fantasy performers might come from ? Here 's a suggestion : look at the holes from 2012 . What I mean is that many players changed teams since January and , in some situations , voids have been created where there is A LOT of opportunity . How do we define opportunity ? In this article , we 'll look at “ lost snaps ” from the 2012 season . These are the situations where players can have a bigger role in their offense , catch more passes , and become fantasy relevant . In some cases , it 's obvious who will fill the void and in others you might need to do some additional digging . To help you interpret these numbers , consider that the average number of snaps for the top 32 receivers in the NFL was 950 snaps . So , a void of 950= 1 new starter . In any instance where more than 950 snaps are available , we 'll assume one starter fills that void and then discuss how the leftover snaps might be allocated . Here we go .

If you follow politics week by week , day by day , it is hard to imagine how any voter could remain undecided on the presidential election at this point . But , of course , there are millions of people who will vote in November who did not participate in the primaries and still — after months of wall-to-wall media coverage — do not know which candidate they will support or even whether they will bother to vote .
Hillary Clinton has a tough assignment tonight : Say something convincing to the wavering non-ideological voter , sulking Sen. Bernie Sanders ( I-Vt. ) supporters , reeling Republicans aghast that their candidate admires Vladimir Putin more than the Constitution and young voters who have little reason to vote for either rich , culturally out-of-it senior citizen . In an age of cynicism , anger , short attention spans and , sadly , widespread ignorance about our political system and basic policy issues , it is hard to imagine persuading significant numbers of voters with appeals to reason , let alone a list of policy proposals .
Well , Clinton might surprise and please voters by doing something different . For once they could be honest . “ I 've got a secret to share just between us , ” they might begin . “ There is no secret , no magic bullet , no political tooth fairy. ” In leveling with voters about the world , about the state of the United States and about how government works , they might gain just a little credibility in the eyes of jaded voters and convince some wavering voters that Donald Trump — whether charlatan , ignoramus or proto-fascist — will take us down a path to ruin . How would that sound ?
The country is not a Third World basket case , not even close . Crime is down , not up over the decades ; more immigrants are leaving than coming ; and despite huge challenges and inadequate funding , our military is the most expert and proficient fighting machine in the history of the world . We have spared millions of lives around the world from childhood diseases and AIDS , and we have the moral authority to lead the free world against the dark forces of Islamist terrorism . If everyone watching the convention had the choice to be born in any country on the planet , who would not choose America ?
Trump , like all egomaniacs with delusions of grandeur , has to concoct , exaggerate and flat-out lie about the state of the country and the source of our problems to gain power . Think about their formula for a moment . If we threw out 11 million to 12 million people , how would that help the unemployed factory worker get a high-tech job or boost the wages of a nurse ? It would n't . All it would do is deprive businesses of customers , government of revenue and fellow Americans of the contributions of these people . Trump is making up problems ( e. g. immigrants are flooding over the border ) and then falsely attributing blame for their distorted image of America .
The real problems we face are not going to be fixed by any single president “ alone , ” and certainly not by an ignorant , mean-spirited buffoon like Trump . How do we prepare students to compete and win in the 21st-century global economy , which is not going to disappear no matter how many tariffs we throw up ? How do we attack endemic poverty , the product of bad policy , poor schools and destructive social trends ? ( Conservatives are deluding themselves if they think a rising tide is going to lift all boats , just as liberals are wrong that single-parenting does not produce children more likely to live in poverty . ) How do we defeat jihadists who have spread like wildfire around the globe and have the power to inspire lone wolves with no previous history of criminal behavior or radicalization ?
It 's easy to dismiss the nature of our complex , difficult challenges by saying “ The system is rigged ” or “ All politicians are corrupt. ” It 's also a lie . The real way — the only way — to make progress is to enlist the entire country in shared goals and find areas of agreement where D 's and R 's can make steady , if not flashy , progress on education , national security , job creation and the rest .
No great social movement — e.g . the civil rights movement of the 1960s — succeeds without convincing the majority of all Americans of the moral imperative of action . That means aiming one 's appeal not merely at the choir but also the unconverted and finding common principles — simple fairness , defense of American virtues , equality of opportunity and respect for fellow citizens and civil liberties .
Clinton at least understands this and does not envision themselves as a lone authoritarian . They are not going to target and scapegoat one ethnic or racial group , nor pull up the drawbridge around Fortress America . They can tell the voters in the arena and at home that rather than remain angry , bitter , divided and suspicious ( are n't we tired of being so angry ? ) , we can do something constructive about serious international challenges , real pain that fellow Americans experience and both justified and unjustified anxiety about globalization .
Clinton can suggest some concrete steps : Go to Congress to put back together a “ grand bargain ” on debt ; restore military spending but also reform worker training and fund the FBI ( i.e . dump the sequester scheme ) ; and rally Democrats and Republicans to respond to Iranian aggression as we solidify international alliances to check Russian aggression and Chinese territorial ambitions . Clinton can pledge to end the politics of demonization and the habit of governing by executive action . They can insist that a unity government inclusive of Republicans and independents populate their administration .
None of this is particularly inspirational . But Clinton is who they are . Them best bet is to appeal to the innate common sense and decency of voters and to offer an alternative — imperfect and un-flashy — to Trumpism .
With a word to Republicans in particular , Clinton might also show some humility . They have made mistakes , a bunch of them , but they are not so ignorant and misguided as to invite Putin to interfere with an election and grab Crimea , or so crazy as to think Mexico will pay for a wall , or so dismissive of the Constitution as to think they can force the military to commit war crimes , or so mean-spirited as to mock the disabled and demean women , minorities and anyone who dares to dissent . These two candidates are not morally equivalent ; they do not populate the same intellectual and moral universe .
Yes , Clinton is the lesser of two evils . That 's not a great message . But there is virtue in truth and hope in rational governance .
( CNN ) -- Heavy rains and flooding Wednesday prompted the closing of the Panama Canal for only the third time in its storied 96-year history .
Officials closed the canal around noon and were hoping to reopen it by Wednesday evening , Fernando Lemos , spokesperson for the Panama Canal administrator , said .
`` The situation might get better in the next few hours , '' Lemos said , `` but there is no exact time as to when the canal will open again . ''
Lemos said most of the heavy rain was in the Chagres River area , causing water behind the Gatun Dam -- which creates Lake Gatun , a significant part of the canal -- to rise .
The last time the canal closed was in 1989 , after the United States invaded Panama to topple strongman Manuel Noriega . Landslides forced the canal to close for several months from late 1915 to mid-1916 , just months after it opened .
The 48-mile canal is a key conduit for shipping between the Pacific and Atlantic oceans .
The canal was built from 1904 to 1914 by the United States , which had sole control over the channel across the Panamanian isthmus until 1979 .
Then , after 20 years of joint U.S.-Panama control , the Panamanian government assumed administration on December 31 , 1999 .

SATURDAY : The chances of Moore going to the Braves are n't completely dead , David O'Brien of the Atlanta Journal-Constitution suggests . If Hart loses their hold on the Braves ' baseball operations , it could pave the way for the team to pursue Moore in earnest , according to O'Brien . The “ belief among some observers ” is that the Royals would be willing to let Moore head to Atlanta if they 're adequately compensated , O'Brien reports .
FRIDAY : Royals owner David Glass denied a request from the Braves to interview GM Dayton Moore for Atlanta 's own top front office position , ESPN.com 's Jerry Crasnick reports . Moore is under contract with Kansas City through at least the 2018 season and thus permission was required for an interview . Such permission is often granted if a promotion is being offered , though that was n't the case here since Moore already holds a job atop a team 's baseball operations depth chart .
The exact nature of what job the Braves were offering is of particular note , as John Hart is still Atlanta 's president of baseball operations . Hart 's future , however , is up in the air due to the ongoing investigation about international signing improprieties within the Braves front office . The investigation has also now extended into looking into alleged violations regarding the amateur draft — Yahoo Sports ' Jeff Passan detailed some of the complaints leveled against former GM John Coppolella in regards to pre-draft agreements .
Coppolella and international scouting director Gordon Blakely both resigned their positions earlier this month , and Hart 's own contract is up after the World Series is over . It could be that Braves upper management decides to move on with an entirely new front office , regardless of what MLB 's investigation does or does n't report about Hart , and thus Atlanta would be able to offer Moore the full control that they have reportedly demanded if they were to change jobs . Though Moore and other names have been connected to their front office opening , the Braves have yet to conduct any interviews with candidates , perhaps due to the uncertainty over Hart . This is just my speculation , but it could also be the case that Moore was the Braves ' top choice , and they 'll now move onto secondary candidates since Glass has denied them a chance to speak to Moore .
Adding an experienced , championship-winning executive like Moore would go a long way towards settling the tumult within the Atlanta organization , particularly given Moore 's past ties to the Braves . For their part , however , Moore has stated that they are happy with the Royals , and reiterated to Crasnick that “ I 'm focused on what we need to do here in Kansas City. ” While the Royals appear to be heading into a rebuild , Moore may also prefer the relative stability of their current position rather than join a Braves franchise that may be hit with some severe penalties , pending the results of the league 's investigation .
A group of disgruntled London Tories has met a drop-dead deadline to tell Ontario Tory Leader Tim Hudak to drop dead .
Bill and Diane Litowski are among 10 party members pushing to change the Progressive Conservative constitution to allow a leadership vote at the party 's policy convention in London next month .
Hudak 's inner circle and caucus supporters were in full damage control Tuesday , as the second petition surfaced in four days calling for their head at next month 's convention .
“ The all-hands-on-deck call to stop the dump-the-leader movement is there , ” said a source close to key Tory insiders .
“ I think Hudak has to look in the mirror long and hard and say , ‘ Is this ever going to be a reality ? ' and , if it 's not , do it now . ”
The ouster attempt follows last week 's Ontario byelections , in which Hudak 's Conservatives picked off only one of five vacant Liberal seats and ran second to the NDP in London West , a riding polls had suggested the PCs could snatch .
The 10 disgruntled Tories are part of a grassroots movement , based in the London area , ­seeking to dump Hudak — but they were n't talking Tuesday .
A similar amendment to the constitution was submitted late last week , but withdrawn .
Under party rules , today is the deadline for any proposed business at next month 's convention .
The Litowskis are among the signatories on the just-proposed amendment , party spokesperson Alan Sakach confirmed Tuesday .
Tories upset at Hudak 's leadership and byelections showing have produced “ hundreds of people looking for a leadership review , ” said a party insider in London . “ Very few think they are a good leader , ” said another longtime Tory , who also did n't want to be named .
“ Tim has not proven to be the right fit . ”
But Monte McNaughton , Conservative MPP for Lambton-Kent-Middlesex , takes issue with those seeking a new leader .
“ I am quite excited about the future under Tim Hudak , ” they said . “ I think under him , the PCs have momentum . ”
McNaughton noted in the last election in 2011 , Hudak 's first at the party helm , the Tories gained 12 seats and in last week 's byelections picked up their first Toronto-area seat in more than a decade , won by former Toronto deputy mayor Doug Holyday in Etobicoke-Lakeshore .
“ We were n't expecting to win any of them , ” McNaughton said of the byelections .
“ I would predict we are going to have an election this fall , ” said McNaughton , who remains solidly behind Hudak .
But Bob Wood , a former Harris-era London Tory from 1995 to 2003 , does n't share McNaughton 's enthusiasm .
“ Clearly , the results of the byelections were not satisfactory and there is widespread concern about that within the party throughout the province , ” said Wood . They said they consider the proposed change to allow a leadership review a good idea .
“ If this materializes the way it appears to be , there may be a good case for having a vote and letting people have their say on it , ” they said .
An informed insider pushing for a review said the question is one of timing .
“ Do we have a replacement ? That is the issue , ” they said . They pointed to MPPs Vic Fedeli , Peter Shurman , Lisa McLeod and newcomer Holyday as potential Hudak replacements .
Reflecting the divisiveness of Hudak in London , yet another organizer dismissed the replacement talk .
“ Yes , there is some discontent due to the results in the last byelection , ” they conceded , “ but I personally believe that discontent is misplaced . ”
“ Tim Hudak should be the leader in the next general election — there is no doubt in my mind , ” they said .
MPP Frank Klees , who ran second to Hudak in the 2009 Tory leadership race , said one option available to the leader is to pre-empt the petitions and to voluntarily direct and “ welcome ” a confidence vote at the convention .
“ If they do that , it would be a very powerful signal to the party . . . . and would silence a lot of naysayers , ” they said .
Sources say Hudak and their inner circle regularly beat their chests in caucus , trumpeting how they 're advancing on the Liberals , how they have the momentum and how it is only a matter of time before they defeat Wynne 's government .
Much of the problem , insiders say , is that Hudak continues to surround themselves with relics from the Mike Harris era , including Harris himself , Leslie Noble , Tom Long and their wife Deb ­Hutton and this “ kitchen cabinet ” still thinks they 're operating as if it were the mid- to late-1990s .
Several party members were angered and insulted by a letter sent out last Friday — under the signature of deputy party leader Christine Elliott — claiming the party “ made huge gains across the province ” in last Thursday 's byelections .
While the Conservatives won their long sought-after seat in Toronto , they lost to the New Democrats in London West and to the ­Liberal machine in Ottawa South .
“ Clearly , the people of Ontario are rejecting Kathleen Wynne 's vision for Ontario . They know
it 's time for change , ” the letter said .
Under existing party rules , a leadership review is automatic after a general election if the party fails to form the government .
After the 2011 election , which the Liberals won by finishing one seat shy of a majority , Hudak won a 78.7 % approval rating .

THE CONVENTION
Image caption The report says that corruption may result in a volatile political and economic environment
Widespread corruption in India costs billions of dollars and threatens to derail the country 's growth , a survey says .
The report by consultancy firm KMPG said that the problem had become so endemic that foreign investors were being deterred from the country .
It was compiled by questioning 100 top domestic and foreign businesses .
Its release comes as Prime Minister Manmohan Singh struggles to cope in the battle against corruption .
Earlier this month the head of the country 's anti-corruption watchdog was forced to resign by the Supreme Court on the grounds that they themselves face corruption charges .
Over the last six months India has been hit by a series of corruption scandals including a multi-billion dollar telecoms scandal , alleged financial malpractices in connection with the Commonwealth Games and allegations that houses for war widows were diverted to civil servants .
Mega scams
`` Today India is faced with a different kind of challenge , '' the report said .
`` It is not about petty bribes ( bakshish ) any more , but scams to the tune of thousands of crores ( billions of rupees ) that highlight a political/industry nexus which , if not checked , could have a far reaching impact .
Image caption Corruption scandals have weighed heavily on Mr Singh 's shoulders
`` Corruption poses a risk to India 's projected 9 % GDP growth and may result in a volatile political and economic environment . ''
Critics of the government say that recent scandals point to a pervasive culture of corruption in Mr Singh 's administration - adding to the difficulties of a politician once seen as India 's most honest .
The government denies the claims and has set up a parliamentary inquiry into corruption .
The BBC 's Sanjoy Majumder in Delhi says that most Indians routinely pay bribes for a number of services such as getting a driver 's licence or a passport .
But , our correspondent says , the KPMG survey makes clear that corruption is now no longer about such petty bribes but mega scams where billions of dollars are siphoned off by government and industry .
The worst-hit areas as identified by the report were real estate and construction - a priority for Delhi which plans to spend $ 1.5tn over the next decade to improve its over-burdened infrastructure .
The report said that the country 's telecommunications industry was also badly affected .
Telecoms Minister Andimuthu Raja resigned in November , denying allegations that they had undersold billions of dollars worth of mobile phone licences . They are now under arrest .
However the KMPG report was not all gloomy . It said that despite the murky regulatory environment , business remained active in India with more than half of those surveyed saying they were unaffected by corruption .
More than 80 % of respondents disagreed that corruption had reduced their ability to access domestic or foreign funds , while 55 % disagreed that corruption had affected their business .

I 've been creating custom-designed LED sabers since April 2013 . Over the past few years , my customer base has grown to the point where it is time to expand my product line for the customers who do not wish to wait for a 100 % custom saber . However , I decided that if we do this , we will do it right . Too often , saber customers are limited by the style of hilts available and once they choose , they are locked in . So 18 months ago , I started developing something new ; something different ; something revolutionary . Now , it 's a reality . Our goal is to raise the capital to expand our operations , hire personnel , get parts mass produced and set up a larger shop . This will allow us to provide saber enthusiasts , hobbyists , cosplayers , and duelists with an incredibly versatile line of sabers . I 'm proud and excited to present the HHCLS OTS Saber .
The OTS line of sabers is based on a patent pending independent chassis , which houses all of the electronics . The independent chassis allows you to utilize as many different OTS hilt pieces as you like to change the look of your saber on the fly . Using just the 40 currently available hilt and trim pieces , you can create over 800,000 different set-ups for your single saber and close to 3,000,000 possibilities for your double-bladed saber ; that does n't even include utilizing the coupler pieces to make extended hilts or doing your own customization .
Since your hilt pieces are n't tied to the electronics , you are free to use many different customization techniques like baked-on enamel , powder-coating , etching , leather-work , rubberizing , and more without fear of damaging your saber . I have created and posted tutorial videos on my YouTube channel that will allow you to truly create your own unique saber…as it should be .
Many of our Rewards Tiers include our Patent Pending Firaxan string blades . We have put years of research and development into creating a blade that is known for its brightness , consistency , and strength , as demonstrated here by our Blade Master , Chase :
Sabers with electronics come with a 3.7v Lithium-ion battery , an on-chassis recharge port , and a wall charger .
So , how does the OTS line of sabers work ? It 's really quite simple , once you unlearn what you have learned . We will work from the inside out to create your masterpiece . First , choose one of the six available chassis levels .
NOTE : Chassis levels 4.1 and 6.1 ( not shown ) do NOT include Firaxan blades , but do come with the blade connectors for future blade purchase .
ALL OTS Chassis will fit the OTS-specific in-hilt LED modules from The Custom Saber Shop .
Next , use your chassis decision to find the best Reward Tier ( s ) to suit your needs . You can select a single set of pieces to make one hilt with the option to add on pieces or you can choose one of our special Kickstarter deals that rewards you with ALL of the available hilt pieces !
To help visualize your saber , please check out the beta version of our virtual 3D saber builder : http : //otsbuilder.site44.com/
The virtual 3D builder is not currently supported on mobile devices . For a mobile builder , you can check out the fan-made 2-D builder here : http : //mtobisch.github.io/otssaberbuilder/
You can also select these add-ons to your pledge . The belt clip mount is an original OTS design that allows you to attach either a Convertec wheel or a D-ring to your hilt without drilling and tapping unsightly holes in your hilt pieces . Additionally , the mount may be placed between any two hilt pieces , allowing you to change the location of your Convertec or D-ring along the hilt or choose to not use it at all if you desire . The mount sandwiches between any two hilt pieces to hold it in place with no screw holes and no tools required .
What wardrobe would be complete with the original HHCLS OTS T-shirt . This cotton tee features an actual OTS assembly drawing right off my drafting table ( okay , my computer ) . It summarizes the heart of the OTS line of sabers with our motto , `` It 's all about the chassis . ''

Despite their name being on the list of cosponsors , Representative Bobby Rush is not supporting the Israel Anti-Boycott Act , their office has confirmed .
The bill , backed by the powerful Israel lobby group AIPAC , has been condemned by the American Civil Liberties Union for violating constitutional free speech rights .
It could impose large fines and long prison sentences on those who boycott Israel in response to a call from an international organization .
The appearance of Rush 's name on the list of cosponsors caused consternation among activists . The Chicago member of congress was a member of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee and the Black Panther Party during the civil rights movement .
They have often been supportive of Palestinian rights , including signing a June letter along with almost three dozen other US lawmakers backing Issa Amro , a Palestinian human rights defender in Hebron who is facing a political trial by Israel 's military .
“ Congressman Rush does not support the Israel Anti-Boycott Act , ” a staffer at the lawmaker 's Washington office told The Electronic Intifada on Tuesday . “ He supports the First Amendment . ”
The staffer 's statement was confirmed in an email on Friday by Rush 's chief of staff .
According to their staff , Rush 's name has remained on the list of cosponsors because Congress is out of session and once it returns next week their office will ask to have it removed .
Grassroots opposition
The Israel Anti-Boycott Act still has 252 other sponsors in the House and 48 in the Senate , but it has not enjoyed the easy , near-unanimous support that measures backed by the Israel lobby typically garner .
High-profile opponents of the legislation include senators Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Kirsten Gillibrand of New York .
And in a strange moment at a townhall meeting last week , Missouri Senator Claire McCaskill claimed , “ I do n't know what anti-BDS is , ” and quickly skipped over a question about the bill – which targets the boycott , divestment and sanctions movement .
McCaskill is one of 13 Senate Democrats backing the bill , but is among several lawmakers who told The Intercept they are reviewing it in light of the concerns raised by the American Civil Liberties Union .
Reject , do n't amend
In face of the sustained grassroots pressure on lawmakers to oppose the bill , its chief Senate sponsor , Ben Cardin of Maryland , has expressed willingness to amend it in order to remove criminal penalties .
But in August , 100 civil and human rights organizations endorsed a statement urging lawmakers to reject the bill outright .
“ Despite Senator Cardin 's efforts to insist the Israel Anti-Boycott Act does n't target political conduct , the leading lobby group for US support of Israel , American Israel Public Affairs Committee ( AIPAC ) , itself frames it as a measure to ‘ Combat the BDS movement , ' ” the groups say .
“ The wave of anti-BDS legislation , promoted by Israel advocacy groups to undermine the movement for Palestinian rights in the United States aims to send a clear signal that support for Palestinian rights is disfavored by our government and is potentially punishable . ”
The groups say that amending the legislation would not solve the underlying unconstitutionality of the bill .
“ We call on members of Congress who currently support the act to withdraw their sponsorship . And we call on all members of Congress to publicly oppose the Israel Anti-Boycott Act and to affirm the First Amendment right to support political boycotts – including those aimed at achieving justice and equality for Palestinians . ”

The Biloxi school district in Mississippi has decided to remove To Kill a Mockingbird from its junior-high reading list . The reason ? Some of the book 's language “ makes people uncomfortable , ” the vice president of the school board , Kenny Holloway , said . “ There were complaints about it , ” they added , “ and we can teach the same lesson with other books. ” The administrator insisted kids could still go to the library to read the book “ but they 're going to use another book in the 8th grade course . ”
Although the school administrator does n't say it , a parent who first contacted the Sun Herald with the news of the apparent mid-year shift in the reading list said the decision to pull the book was “ due to the use of the ‘ N ' word . ”
When school districts remove 'To Kill A Mockingbird ' from the reading list , we know we have real problems . https : //t.co/TF3fGZmvXp — Arne Duncan ( @ arneduncan ) October 14 , 2017
Many criticized the decision by the school district , including Arne Duncan , who was secretary of Education from 2009-2015 under President Obama . “ When school districts remove To Kill a Mockingbird from the reading list , we know we have real problems , ” Duncan wrote on Twitter . Sen. Ben Sasse of Nebraska also blasted the move , calling it “ a terrible decision . ”
This is a terrible decision . It 's one of our few shared stories -- in a nation with far too few shared stories right now . https : //t.co/Um7QBiSkif — Ben Sasse ( @ BenSasse ) October 14 , 2017
The Sun Herald , which was the first to break the story earlier their week , published an editorial criticizing the decision by the school district :
Acting as if race is no longer a factor in our society is part of the problem . Acting as if it is too difficult or offensive to talk about is part of the problem .
We have not , in fact , overcome racism .
The racists in our society must be confronted . They must not be allowed to assume our silence is acquiescence .
In the book , the Finch children , Scout and Jem , grow when they confront evil . They discover prejudice and overcome it . And that is because their father , Atticus , treats them maturely and guides them in the right direction .
The Biloxi school system should follow their example .
This is not the first time a school district has decided to pull the classic Harper Lee book , which is often listed as one of the country 's most frequently banned books . Last year , To Kill a Mockingbird and The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn were removed from classrooms in Accomack County , Virginia following a complaint about the use of the N-word .
In what was obvious to many , except for those who literally have their pockets lined to the brim with cold hard bribe money , FIFA President , and reigning matchstick man of the century Sepp Blatter announced they will approach FIFA 's executive committee with a proposal to have the 2022 World Cup hosted by Qatar to be held in the northern hemisphere 's winter . Sepp , with the help of “ new scientific studies , ” and a tiny sliver of common sense has determined that playing football in 120° F could be detrimental to players health . The study , written on a cocktail napkin , reads as follows , “ Bad to play in very hot . Signed Science . ”
The major European domestic football associations are quickly lining up against the switch claiming the domestic campaigns before , during , and after the World Cup could be disrupted . Now , for one second , let 's forget the claim that this World Cup was purchased , or that is being played in a country with no footballing history . What is so wrong with moving the World Cup to December or January one time ? A little disruption to England , France , Germany , Italy , and Spain ? What about Brazil and Argentina , are they not footballing superpowers ? Do they not deserve to have a single World Cup not disrupt their respective leagues ? And the rest of South America , the USA , Africa , the frozen Nordics and Russians , are they just the peasants of the footballing world . Is it reasonable to think that if Spain , Portugal , France , Greece , and Italy 's ( to name a few ) economic woes continue to down trot that Brazil , USA , and even Mexico might become viable , if not , desirable destinations come 2022 ? Does Europe 's control over the games governance continue indefinitely ? This is the World 's Game , and the world is changing . Besides , my view of the game remains idealistic , I believe the World Cup should serve in function as an ambassador and reward to the host ; both a way to open the sport to a country , and in return open a country to the world .
Perhaps Sepp , frozen in the 1960s with Austin Powers , and thawed in the modern world , is actually putting the global game ahead of Europe 's desires . I shutter at the idea , but what if , just what if , Blatter is right for a change ? Of men frozen in the 1960s , you would presume he 's more Dr . Evil than Austin Powers , but maybe for this one occasion it 's the other way around .

Donna Edwards became a member of Congress -- one of the best members of Congress -- in 2008 . But , truth be told , their constituents elected them in 2006 ... only to see the victory snatched out of their hands on election night with last minute stuffed ballot boxes from corrupt conservative Al Wynn and their Machine . Donna got to work on the 2008 campaign the next day and after Donna eviscerated them in the primary -- 59 % to 37 % -- they resigned to become a corporate lobbyist .
Last year Tim Canova ran a similar grassroot progressive race against the female counterpart to Wynn -- Debbie Wasserman Schultz , the same crook who , as DNC chair , was fired for fixing the primaries for Hillary Clinton . They fixed the election for Hillary ; did they fix their own election against Canova ? They always thought so but the media and DC establishment went bonkers when they mentioned it and nearly drove this good man out of politics with all their vitriol and venom . Polling was showing them ahead but on primary day Wasserman Schultz beat them 28,809 to 21,907 in a very low turnout election .
Friday , Marc Caputo broke the story atabout how Brenda Snipes a crooked Wasserman Schultz crony and ally and the Broward County elections chief broke the law by destroying ballots cast in the tight primary election between Wasserman Schultz and Tim Canova after Canova sued to get access to the ballots . Canova , according to Caputo `` wanted to inspect the optical-scan ballots cast in their Aug. 30 primary race against Wasserman Schultz because they had concerns about the integrity of the elections office . ''
Under longstanding federal law , ballots cast in a congressional race are n't supposed to be destroyed until 22 months after the election . And under state law , a public record sought in a court case is not supposed to be destroyed without a judge 's order .
Snipes ' office , however , destroyed the paper ballots in question in October -- in the middle of Canova 's lawsuit -- but says it 's lawful because the office made high-quality electronic copies . Canova 's legal team found out after the fact last month .
“ The documents were not destroyed because they were maintained in an electronic format , ” Snipes ' attorney , Burnadette Norris-Weeks , told Politico . “ They have the documents ... They did a two-day inspection of the ballots . ”
But Canova , a Nova Southeastern University law professor , and their attorney say they wanted originals to make sure they were n't tampered with . Digital copies can be altered , they said .
Seven election-law lawyers interviewed by Politico do not share Snipes ' attorney 's interpretation of the statute . Nor does the Department of Justice 's voting division , which is in charge of enforcing the federal law .
“ If it 's a federal election , i.e. , there is at least one federal candidate on the ballot , the custodian must keep the ballots for 22 months , ” Brett Kappel , a Washington lawyer with Akerman LLP , said in an email to Politico . “ State law may require a shorter time for retention , but federal law would pre-empt any such state law with regard to ballots cast for federal candidates . ”
Kappel said evidence in an active court case should never be unilaterally destroyed . They said actual paper ballots are superior to imaged copies , and they pointed to the legal wrangling over Florida 's now-discarded punch-card ballots that were banned after the disputed 2000 presidential elections in Florida .
... Hans von Spakovsky , an elections expert with the conservative Heritage Foundation , said the ballots must be preserved in paper form for 22 months . They said there 's a simple reason that original ballots are superior to an electronic image : “ These electronic systems can be hacked . ”
According to Snipes ' office , however , the ballot copies are of high quality for a review . Them attorney also dismissed Canova as a sore loser who 's trying to create a name for themselves as they challenge Wasserman Schultz a second time .
“ Mr . Canova lost this election , ” they said . “ He 's been all over Washington and has been trying to do a documentary because he 's upset they lost the election . ”
In one hearing , Norris-Weeks insisted that they “ certainly could get [ a sworn statement ] from Debbie Wasserman Schultz ” to say that “ she knows that they 're preparing a documentary , and they 're running all around talking to different people trying to do that . ”
But Canova said the accusation was false .
“ I 'm not working on a documentary , ” they said . “ It is unfortunate that counsel for the Supervisor of Elections has to make things up to somehow justify the office 's illegal actions . ”
Wasserman Schultz 's office declined to comment , but they have said they look forward to again facing Canova , whom they beat by 13.6 percentage points last year .
Canova did n't want to comment about their specific motivations for the suit , but acknowledged they have concerns about the race against Wasserman Schultz . Canova 's interest in the ballots was piqued by Lulu Friesdat , a documentary filmmaker and activist with a group called the Election Integrity network , which filed the first records request to inspect or copy the ballots in March .
A month later , Snipes ' office responded to the records request by saying it would cost $ 71,868.87 to sort and produce the ballots for inspection . Canova soon got involved with their attorney , Leonard Collins , and eventually they negotiated a price reduction that brought the cost down to about $ 3,000 . But relations soured , and Canova sued in June .
Snipes ' office , meanwhile , is involved in two other lawsuits and has been plagued by errors and controversies over public records and paperwork .
How Many Injuries Have The 2012-13 Lakers Suffered ?
With the news breaking that guards Steve Nash , Steve Blake and Jodie Meeks are all doubtful for Game 3 tomorrow night against the Spurs , we decided to create a table of all the injuries during the 2012-13 season .
—–Check out the Lakers Nation store to get your LN gear and show off your Lakers pride ! ——
Nash , Blake , Pau Gasol and Jordan Hill have all been injured several times as there have been 17 different injuries to the team .
Kobe Bryant 's injury wo n't only affect games missed and the team 's record for this season , but it 's expected that Kobe will miss some games to start the season .
Regardless , when general manager Mitch Kupchak put this roster together over the summer there 's no way they could 've predicted the rash of injuries their “ super team ” would face in 2012-13 . In total , the Lakers lost 176 total games due to injury .
Here 's a complete list of all the injuries ( in chronological order ) that have taken place this season :
Did you see all the international coverage of the election in Indonesia recently ? The reports on CNN and Al Jazeera about the shock result , the inexorable rise of the fundamentalists , the mass demonstrations on the streets , the mutterings of discontent among the military , the chaos at the polling stations , the whiff of tear gas hanging in the night air ? No ? Oddly enough me neither .
In fact did you see any coverage of the election in the global media ? Admittedly we in the world's third-largest democracy were upstaged by our friends in the world's the biggest democracy , India .
I did see one brief report on the Indonesian election on the BBC , but let's face it when it comes to the BBC and India no other developing nation gets a look-in .
But this wasn't how it was supposed to be . We were warned by international pundits that instability in the 'Fragile Five' ; Brazil , India , Indonesia , South Africa and Turkey would be a major factor in world news in 2014 , particularly with elections in three of them , Brazil , India and Indonesia .
Well I don't know how things will work out in Brazil or India , but for the 'Breaking News' brigade of the 24-hour rolling coverage channels , Indonesia has been a bit of a damp squib , hasn't it ?
It has been this way with Indonesia for a while now , the biggest news stories are to do with economic matters and most of them are of the decidedly yawneroo variety ; the monthly percentage change in the current-account deficit , export policy and motor-cycle sales . Once the great menacing 'Archipelago of Fear' , brooding with latent violence and danger , Indonesia's problems seem to have become rather mundane . Dare we say it , Indonesia is getting a bit boring nowadays .
Despite this , foreign correspondents still seem to have a lingering subconscious feeling that something must , de facto , be fundamentally wrong in Indonesia . As with the fatuous Fragile Five cited above , journalists love to lump nations , particularly emerging economies , into snappily named groups . The BBC website has a report on the 'MINT' economies ; Mexico , Indonesia , Nigeria and Turkey . The writer waxes lyrical about the prospects for three of these , the exception being Indonesia , which lacks a 'wow factor' and faces infrastructural hurdles .
Mexico is currently in the middle of an undeclared civil war between , and among , the government and the drugs cartels , which has left 70,000 dead , their disemboweled bodies left hanging from overpasses or dismembered and dumped at shopping malls . In the last two weeks Nigeria has made the headlines twice , take your pick between a bomb at a bus station in the capital that killed over 70 people or the abduction by Boko Haram of more than 230 schoolgirls . In Turkey , after weeks of violent street protests last year , the government has tried to ban YouTube and Twitter to prevent discussion of alleged corruption in the prime minister's family .
Yes , you can really see how when faced with wow factors like these in other nations international investors might be put off Indonesia because of outdated facilities at Soekarno-Hatta International Airport .
And how about that other famous group of emerging economic powers that Indonesians once looked so enviously at ? How are things in the BRICS economies ? Still looking to invest in China's 'economic miracle' ? And Russia ? No , let's just pass swiftly over Russia .
Even one of the most reported problems in Indonesia , the flooding that regularly blights several parts of Jakarta for hours , or sometimes days , during the peak of the rainy season doesn't compare to the truly apocalyptic deluge that slowly engulfed Thailand in 2011 . Come to that how does Indonesia's political situation compare to that in Thailand , the one-time media darling of Southeast Asia ? I await with bated breath the gushing report titled 'Indonesia , the most stable and most liberal democracy in Southeast Asia' in the New York Times or Wall Street Journal , I'm sure it won't be long now .
Indonesia still has many problems , but most of these problems relate to its steady economic growth and development . The number of reforms the nation still needs to make could fill several volumes and every two steps forward seem to meet one step back . Nonetheless , despite the perennial naysayers , progress in Indonesia is obvious and tangible .
The growth is not spectacular but frankly Indonesia doesn't need another 'tiger' boom , that didn't work out so well the last time . The development is mostly below the radar and not especially exciting , the building of new roads , factories and port facilities are reported daily in The Jakarta Post , but rarely get much mention outside the business pages .
Compared to riots , tsunamis , bombs and transportation disasters there is currently little to attract the attention of the world's media to Indonesia .
Back in the day Indonesians , with their customary self-deprecatory sense of humor , rebutted the absurd archipelago-of-fear image with the car sticker : 'Travel warning , Indonesia dangerously beautiful' . For the world's adrenaline-junkie foreign correspondents looking to do their reports to camera in that particular dodging-the-bullets crouch so beloved of a certain type of reporter today , the message is , 'Warning , Indonesia dangerously dull' .

Joachim Low 's much-changed Germany opened their Confederations Cup campaign with a 3-2 victory over Australia in Sochi .
The world champions did not bring the likes of Toni Kroos , Manuel Neuer and Thomas Muller with them to Russia , but Low 's experimental team proved to be more-than-adequate replacements for this test as Lars Stindl , captain Julian Draxler and Leon Goretzka all found the net .
However , two errors from goalkeeper Neuer 's deputy Bernd Leno kept Australia in it as Celtic 's Tom Rogic and Tomi Juric scored in either half , the second still standing despite the goal being referred to the much-debated video assistant referee ( VAR ) at the time .
It took less than five minutes for the Germans to break the deadlock as they explored an avenue down the Aussies ' left which proved fruitful throughout the first period .
Three Australian defenders all got sucked into the near post when Julian Brandt prepared to cross and they cut the ball back for an unmarked Stindl to slam home their first international goal .
Germany could have been out of sight before the half-hour mark as they constantly unlocked a pass-orientated back three their visitors looked vulnerable in .
Sandro Wagner , scorer of a hat trick against San Marino earlier this month , spurned two glorious chances when nodding wide and dragging a left-footed attempt off target while Brandt drew new Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan into a near-post stop .
However , Australia finally threatened against the run of play in the 37th minute when Aaron Mooy 's free kick was headed wide by an unmarked Trent Sainsbury , and four minutes later they did level through Rogic .

Draxler 's misplaced pass gave Australia the ball inside their own half and though Rogic 's first wayward attempt was blocked by Jonas Hector , they converted the second chance by firing underneath Leno 's hands from range .
Germany would retake the lead prior to the break , though , as Draxler scored a penalty when Massimo Luongo slid through the back of Goretzka .
Die Mannschaft 's two brightest performers Joshua Kimmich and Goretzka combined to make it 3-1 three minutes into the second half as the former 's delicious through ball was blasted in by the Schalke midfielder .
Yet the next Leno gaffe gave Australia another goal and a route back into the contest before the hour mark .
Rogic 's shot from the edge of the area was lacking any real venom and should have been dealt with comfortably by the Bayer Leverkusen goalkeeper , but they spilled the attempt into the path of Juric , who was left with a simple finish to make it 3-2 .
Germany 's players protested about the goal to American referee Mark Geiger -- possibly for an offside or a handball by Juric from Rogic 's original shot -- and the official signalled that they would refer to the VAR in a tournament where its usage has been controversial .
Juric was clearly onside and there was no conclusive proof from the replays that there had been a deliberate handball from the scorer so the game quickly restarted with Geiger 's original call standing .
The Aussies did have opportunities to claim a draw having been galvanised by their replacements , with substitutes James Troisi and Robbie Kruse each testing Leno , while Timo Werner , who also appeared from the bench , hit the post at the other end .
Australia put on Tim Cahill in place of Juric in search of a late equalizer , but the 37-year-old forward could not find an opportunity .
Germany joined Chile with three points in Group B after the South American champions defeated Cameroon 2-0 on Sunday .
But Australia can take heart knowing that they pushed the world champions , who had outscored opponents 27-1 since the previous time they allowed two goals in a game , a 2-0 defeat to France at Euro 2016 .
Karen Memory by Elizabeth Bear Publisher : Tor Books - Pages : 352 - eBook Buy : Book
Karen Memery is a seamstress – which is to say , salon girl – at the Hotel Mon Cherie in Rapid City . Though romantically inclined towards womenfolk , Karen is a practical soul in a comfortable , well-paying position that lets them save for the future , and their employer , the formidable and aptly-named Madame Damnable , makes sure their girls are protected . But not all who share their profession are so lucky : Chinese and Indian girls in particular are vulnerable to slavery and exploitation , as are those who work the streets . So when Merry Lee , the famous saviour of trafficked girls , shows up badly injured with Priya , their latest rescue , Karen and their sisters are quick to defend them against their pursuers – a man named Peter Bantle and their toughs . But Bantle wo n't give Priya up so easily , and soon , their escalating retaliations against Karen , Madame Damnable and the other girls land them with much bigger problems . Who is killing Rapid City 's streetwalkers ? How is Bantle running for mayor ? And what can Karen do to stop it ?
Karen Memory is an energetic , engaging novel and an absolute pleasure to read . Though technically steampunk , the bulk of the story has less to do with brass , cogs and technology and more to do with the varying intersections of character , sexuality , race and gender that necessarily underpin an evolving , industrial , frontier society – and all done with a rambunctious sense of fun . A hallmark of Bear 's writing is their effortless use of narrative voice to reflect a different time , place and culture , and Karen Memory is no different . Told as the first person reminiscence of the titular hero , the language and cadence immediately situate the reader in the setting and contrive , through a combination of excellent pacing and complex characterisation , to keep them there .
I honestly ca n't think of another book I 've read that 's put sex workers front and centre without taking that as an excuse to describe them in bed .
Here 's the thing about Karen Memory : it 's a story whose protagonists – or most of them , anyway – are prostitutes , but which features no sex scenes . This should n't be a rare thing in literature ; it is , for instance , quite common to mention a protagonist 's profession without ever showing them engaged ( ahem ) in the throes of it . If the profession in question is something like law or teaching , for instance , we might hear peripherally about its impact on the character , but that does n't mean we always get lengthy courtroom/classroom scenes , especially if the real action , so to speak , is taking place elsewhere . Yet sex workers , it seems , are seldom if ever extended such narrative courtesy : their lives are viewed as synonymous with their professions , and I honestly ca n't think of another book I 've read that 's put sex workers front and centre without taking that as an excuse to describe them in bed .
The realities of the profession in the time and place are neither exaggerated nor elided . Karen works at a high-class establishment under the auspices of a caring female madame , one who not only strives to protect their girls , but to educate and support them . That some of Karen 's sisters are women who would elsewhere be subject to different social prejudices than Karen herself , particularly within the context of their profession – like Bea , who is black , or Miss Francina , who is trans – is precisely why Madame Damnable 's establishment is not just a home , but a refuge ; which is , in turn , why Merry Lee and Priya are offered sanctuary there . But neither is the Hotel Mon Cherie romanticised : the women are always aware of the potential perilousness of their situation , not just because of Peter Bantle 's threats , but in terms of how they 're viewed by “ respectable ” citizens , and what everyday courtesies they can or ca n't expect from such people . Priya and Merry Lee are both trafficking victims , and unprotected streetwalkers are being whipped to death by an unknown killer : neither the reader nor the characters are allowed to forget the crucial distinction between those who choose their profession and those robbed of choice , nor the further distinction between those who , having chosen it , are working in better , safer , more hospitable circumstances than others .
Karen Memory is a lively , heartfelt novel with a suite of funny , clever , courageous , complex heros .
The inclusion of Bass Reeves – a real historical figure , and the apparent inspiration for the character of the Lone Ranger – is a particularly nice touch ; as , for that matter , is the realism in Bear 's portrayal of the daily life of Karen and their sisters . ( Those interested in the history of the oldest profession could do worse than to read Nils Ringdal 's Love For Sale : A Global History of Prostitution , which is both fascinating and accessible . ) For all the presence of steampunk elements , like electric gloves , airships and mind-control devices , at its heart , this is a story about people – which is , I think , a pertinent means of distinguishing it as an adventure , rather than action , narrative . Whereas action stories are primarily concerned with and defined by external elements – chase scenes , explosions , ticking clocks – adventure stories are more internally focussed , exploring the impact of such devices from a human perspective . Action shows us characters through the lens of crisis , but adventure shows us crisis through the lens of characterisation , and while it 's certainly possible to fuse the two , Karen Memory , with its endearing narration and wonderful cast , sits very firmly in the latter category .
Karen Memory is a lively , heartfelt novel with a suite of funny , clever , courageous , complex heros . I recommend it without hesitation , and if I was n't already a fan of Elizabeth Bear , I certainly would be now .
EVERGREEN , Colo. -- At the Tributary at 244 in Evergreen , nothing is quite the same , ever since Matt Vogler lost a very special member of the staff .
`` He was n't just my family member , they were kind of all of our family member , '' Vogler said .
It 's easy to understand why . Rue , a 5-year-old Catahoula mix was n't just part of the bar , they were the life of it .
`` When you come into Tributary , it 's everyone 's dog , '' said Pauly Brunner , a regular at the restaurant and bar .
On July 5 , Vogler said a suspicious man walked into the back door of the bar which was closed .
Vogler 's girlfriend confronted them and they told them they needed directions .
`` She felt threatened and concerned for their safety , '' Vogler said .
Vogler said the man , described as Hispanic , mid 30 's , about 5 ' 7 '' and wearing a Broncos jersey , left in a 4-door beige sedan Chrysler .
`` As I got outside I immediately realized that Rue was missing , '' Vogler said .
Vogler is now offering a $ 5,000 reward for the safe return of Rue , no questions asked .
If you have any information , call Matt or Diane at 303-748-7448 or 303-674-0338 .
We may not see Mary as a figure worthy of worship , yet evangelicals can still learn much from their portrayal in the Gospels .
National Geographic 's December cover proclaims Mary , the mother of Jesus , as “ the most powerful woman in the world. ” The story itself examines Marian apparitions and Marian devotion across the globe , profiling those who claim to have experienced visitations and healing from Mary .
Speaking in the article to Mary 's enduring appeal , New Testament and Jewish Studies professor Amy Jill-Levine says that because so little is known of Mary from Scripture , “ you can project on them whatever cultural values you have. ” While that is true to an extent , we are also told more about Mary in the New Testament than about most of the disciples .
Although evangelicals do not embrace Mary as an intercessor or source of miraculous healing , there is much we can learn from their portrayal in the Gospels . In the last decade , evangelical leaders like Timothy George and Scot McKnight have called upon the Protestant world to embrace the Biblical portrait of Mary and reflect with more care on what they teach us . McKnight writes , “ She has become little more than a delicate piece in a Christmas crèche , whom we bring out without comment at Christmas and then wrap up gently until we see them again next Advent. ” So , how can our knowledge of Mary deepen our knowledge of Christ ?
We might first recognize that Mary was on the margins of society . Likely poor , and certainly a socially ostracized figure in light of their gender , social status , and unwed pregnancy , Mary lived on the fringe . Yet when the angel appears — in spite of knowing the social cost which accepting this divine commission would bring — Mary willingly accepts their commission . And their mission indeed came with a cost , just as it would even more so for their Son , and for all who follow Him . In a sense , Mary foreshadows the sacrificial ministry of Jesus and the sacrificial ministry to which They call Their church . It is often recognized that Jesus frequently ministered to the marginalized of society . It 's worth remembering that their mother was on the margins herself .
Johnson previously visited M with their Prattville teammates [ Photo via 247 ]
The satellite camp tour has produced its third commitment in three days . Prattville ( AL ) outside linebacker Dytarious Johnson quickly accepted Michigan 's offer after putting on an impressive performance in front of the coaching staff yesterday . The Wolverines were the first Power 5 offer for Johnson , who at the moment of their commitment only had a recruiting profile on Rivals , which gives them a perfunctory two stars .
Johnson is Michigan 's third commitment from Prattville since Jim Harbaugh took over , joining incoming first-year student CB Keith Washington and 2016 RB Kingston Davis . Prior to Harbaugh 's arrival , the Wolverines had n't landed a prospect from any Alabama high school since Madison Bob Jones RB Max Martin in 2004 . While Johnson 's commitment came as a surprise , he 's been on the coaches ' radar since they recruited Washington and Davis , and their strong showing at the satellite camp sealed their offer , per Sam Webb :
“ When I went and visited ( with Davis in April ) they told me they wanted to evaluate me more , ” Johnson recalled . “ They wanted me to come to their ( satellite ) camp ( in Prattville ) , and I guess they liked what they saw ( because ) they offered me today . So I wanted to commit. ” “ ( Harbaugh ) told me , ‘ congratulations and welcome to the team . ' ”
Johnson is the tenth commit in Michigan 's class of 2016 , and the third at linebacker , joining Dele ' Harding and David Reese . ( Reese could potentially end up at fullback . )

While it 's safe to expect Johnson will at least rise into the three-star range as they get more exposure , the recruiting services are still cobbling together profiles for them at the moment ; Rivals remains the lone outlet to give them a ranking . The four sites are in relative agreement on their size , listing them at either 6 ' 0 '' or 6 ' 1 '' and 205-215 pounds .
SCOUTING
As you can probably guess , there is n't a whole lot out there yet on Johnson . They earned a positive mention from Scout 's John Garcia Jr. after Prattville came up short in last season 's state championship game :
One of the few defensive standouts for the Lions , these underclassmen has versatility on their side . They line up in the middle or on the edge at linebacker and makes plays against both the pass and the run . Though undersized at 6-foot , 185 pounds , they simply make plays . A tackle for loss was among their four recorded stops .
That 's all I could find on him—that article was n't even linked to Johnson 's Scout profile , since one did n't exist last night—other than Sam Webb 's tweet about their camp performance on Friday :
2016 Prattville ( Ala. ) LB Dytarious Johnson may have been the best of the LB bunch today . Received a lot of love from the # Michigan staff — Sam Webb ( @ SamWebb77 ) June 5 , 2015
We do have Johnson 's junior highlights , which I 'm going to post up here :
Magnus posted an evaluation today based on that film , and I had much the same reaction after seeing it myself :
For being a linebacker , he 's a very smooth runner who moves like a strong safety . The first highlight in their film below is of them playing man coverage on a slot receiver , staying right on their hip on a wheel route , and tracking the ball down in the air ; they tip it to themselves and races about 75 yards to the endzone . They also like to hit , and they take good angles to the football . One thing I also like is that they seem to understand their role as an outside linebacker , and they do a very good job of maintaining leverage and fighting off blocks to keep outside contain . The athleticism is there , but some basic fundamentals are lacking . Their stance and footwork will probably need to be adjusted , but that will come with reps and coaching . They will also need to get stronger and add a little bit of weight .
The coaches seem to have noticed some of the same technical issues , and had already started working through them at Friday 's camp , according to the Montgomery Advertiser :
Johnson said they learned `` a lot '' at the four-hour camp . `` I learned how to get in my stance and how to turn my hips , '' said Johnson , who plays linebacker . `` The footwork . ''
Magnus added that Johnson 's highlights could easily be confused for those of a four-star prospect , and I 'm inclined to agree ; they look strong against both the run and pass , closes quickly on the football , and hits hard . This is a very lofty comparison , but they remind me a little of Ohio State strongside linebacker Darron Lee , a three-star safety with a similar build out of high school . Lee was one of OSU 's most valuable players last season because they could disrupt opponent running and passing games while lining up in the box or over the slot . Johnson has the potential to fill a similar role .
OFFERS
Johnson also holds offers from Alabama State , Georgia Southern , Georgia State , Jacksonville State , Memphis , South Alabama , and Troy . Add them to the ever-increasing group of test cases for Harbaugh 's eye for talent and their ability to identify it early .
HIGH SCHOOL
Mostly covered above ; Prattville has emerged as an unlikely Michigan pipeline , and given the program 's recent success , that could get the Wolverines in on future talented prospects , as well .
STATS
Per MaxPreps , Johnson was second on Prattville with 82 total tackles ( 57 solo ) as a junior . They also tallied four passes defensed and an interception they returned 71 yards for a touchdown ( first clip in their highlights—it 's well worth a watch ) .
FAKE 40 TIME
Johnson 's Hudl page lists a 4.50 , which gets five FAKEs out of five . ( No obvious source , non-specific time , is a linebacker . ) Their page also lists a 4.30 shuttle time , 32.5 '' vertical , 315-pound bench press , and 405-pound squat .
PREDICTION BASED ON FLIMSY EVIDENCE
Johnson seems like they could be anything from a Lee-style hybrid space player to a more traditional weakside linebacker , depending on their physical development and how the roster shakes out in front of him . The linebacker two-deep will be wide open after Joe Bolden , Desmond Morgan , and James Ross all graduate following this season , though I 'd still expect Johnson to take a redshirt year . After a redshirt year—which will also see Ben Gedeon and Allen Gant exhaust their eligibility—he should be in position to compete for a spot on the depth chart .
UPSHOT FOR THE REST OF THE CLASS
Oh , heck , copy-and-paste again :
It 's still far too early to take a stab at the final numbers for this class ; it 's clear the coaches are eyeing a class in the neighborhood of 20-25 prospects , which would require a decent but not unreasonable amount of attrition before Signing Day . Wide receiver , tight end , offensive line , defensive tackle , defensive end , outside linebacker , and—depending on where Enis and maybe Evans end up—defensive back remain areas of need .
Michigan is in good position with several highly ranked linebacker prospects ; expect them to continue pursuing guys who can fit at that hybrid BUCK spot , such as five-star Caleb Kelly .
The Wolverines are now up to ten total commitments , and pending the inevitable attrition they only have room for four more right now . While there is understandable concern about oversigning , a couple long-rumored roster moves that have yet to become official are still well within the realm of possibility . Right now the numbers look tight and recruiting shows no signs of slowing down ; my guess is the coaches know a few things we do n't about the roster outlook .

Scottish Secretary Alistair Carmichael has said the UK government will not be able to stop Scotland from making changes to areas of welfare benefits when they are devolved .
A Command Paper containing 57 pages of draft clauses which could become a new Scotland bill was published last week .
The SNP claimed it contained `` vetoes '' which could stop Holyrood making its own decisions on welfare .
Mr Carmichael insisted there was no veto in the draft clauses .
The clauses , announced by Prime Minister David Cameron in Edinburgh , are the latest stage in ensuring that the proposals from the Smith Commission on further devolution meet the timetable set out shortly before the independence referendum in September .
The Conservatives , Labour and the Liberal Democrats have all pledged to ensure the new Scotland Bill becomes law , whoever wins the election .
Image caption Alistair Carmichael said there was no veto in the clauses
Image caption John Swinney said the power of devolution was being constrained
The Scottish government complained that the Smith proposals had been `` watered down '' by clauses that required Scottish ministers to consult the UK government before making decisions .
They said that some clauses gave the UK government a veto over their plans to amend Universal Credit and get rid of the bedroom tax .
Mr Carmichael , a Liberal Democrat MP , told the BBC 's Sunday Politics Scotland that the Scottish government had a `` duty to consult '' the UK government over any changes to welfare provisions but they said this was `` in no way , shape or form a veto '' .
They said : `` Having had the consultation , if the two governments take different views at the end of the day then the Scottish government is still entitled to go ahead with what they want to do .
`` In no way could that possibly be described as a veto . ''
Mr Carmichael said the date of a change of welfare benefit did have to be agreed with the UK government but that agreement `` could not be unreasonably withheld '' .
The Scottish secretary said the date needed to be agreed for practical reasons such as changes to computer systems .
Deputy First Minister John Swinney said Mr Carmichael 's comments had brought some clarity to the matter .
But they said the Scottish secretary now needed to go away to re-write the clause .
They pointed out that there was a no limit to how long the UK government could claim that the timing was not practical and this was not true devolution .
Mr Swinney said : `` The point of devolution is that when a power is devolved , we are then able to exercise that power on our terms and take the consequences or the benefits of that decision .
`` The power of devolution is constrained by us having to seek consent from UK ministers . ''

`` He reminds me of playing with Alex [ Ovechkin ] with their quick release , '' Backstrom said , comparing their six-time Rocket Richard Trophy winning Washington Capitals ' teammate to their 22-year-old Team Sweden linemate . `` He loves shooting the puck . They love to go to the net . They love creating stuff . In that way they remind me of Ovi . ''
For Backstrom , it reminds them of playing with another left wing .
TORONTO -- A big part of Team Sweden center Nicklas Backstrom 's job at the World Cup of Hockey 2016 is to get the puck to left wing Filip Forsberg in a shooting position .
Forsberg was told what Backstrom said after Team Sweden 's practice at Air Canada Centre on Friday in advance of its semifinal game against Team Europe on Sunday ( 1 p.m . ET ; ESPN , CBC , TVA Sports ) .
They were thrilled .
`` He 's a 50-goal scorer every year , so that 's got ta be something good , '' Forsberg said .
Video : NAT @ SWE : Forsberg beats Gibson blocker side
The irony is that Forsberg , Backstrom and Ovechkin could have been teammates in Washington . They would have been but former Capitals general manager George McPhee traded Forsberg to the Nashville Predators for Martin Erat before the 2013 NHL Trade Deadline .
Now Forsberg is a burgeoning star in Music City . He 's the same for the Swedish national team .
Forsberg scored 33 goals last season after scoring 26 as a rookie in 2014-15 . They have one goal on eight shots in three games at the World Cup , their second time playing for Sweden 's national team . They scored eight goals on 28 shots in eight games at the 2015 IIHF World Championship , their first experience playing for Sweden .
Team Sweden is banking on Forsberg to provide offense against Team Europe on Sunday to help advance to the best-of-3 final . The Predators are banking on Forsberg to be even better this season .
`` I saw a lot of growth and maturity [ in Forsberg last season ] , '' Predators coach Peter Laviolette said . `` I saw a player that was able to handle , in the second full year , the rigors of the NHL and being able to stay strong and be a real force for us . The schedule can sometimes grind players down . Filip took steps and really was a strong player for us , a consistent player . He 's a guy that we 're counting on to take the next step and be a real productive player for us . ''
Forsberg is doing that with the Swedish national team now . He 's turning heads , mainly because of their shot , which is the first thing Team Sweden 's players mention when they get asked about Forsberg .
`` When they have the puck he 's unbelievable , '' said defenseman Oliver Ekman-Larsson , one of three players on Sweden 's World Cup team who also played with Forsberg in the 2015 World Championship . `` If they keep playing like he 's playing he 's going to be a superstar in the NHL . ''
Ekman-Larsson said Forsberg gives themselves an advantage because they use a long stick .
`` It 's hard to take the puck away from him , '' they said . `` He has a great reach so they can shoot from far away , but in tight too . You have to be aware of him . ''
That 's going to be a job for Team Europe defenseman Roman Josi Sunday . It 's an obvious change of pace for Josi , who plays with Forsberg in Nashville and , like Team Sweden 's players , mentions Forsberg 's shot first when he 's asked about him .
`` He 's got a great release and it 's tough for goalies , '' Josi said . `` He releases it so quick and you do n't know where it 's going . ''
Josi agreed with the comparison to Ovechkin , especially on the man-advantage .
`` He 's set up like Ovechkin too on the power play and we look for them for their shot , for their one-timer , '' Josi said . `` He 's definitely a shooter and a goal scorer . ''
Do they know any tricks that will help them Sunday ?
`` Yeah , do n't let them shoot too much , '' Josi said , laughing . `` Whenever they get close to the net he 's really dangerous and can release that wrist shot really quick , so do n't let them shoot it too much . ''
That 'll be a challenge , because Team Sweden wants Forsberg to shoot the puck as much and as often as they can . That 's why he 's playing on a line with Backstrom and Patric Hornqvist . It 's why he 's on the power play with them too .
Video : NAT @ SWE : 1st Period Highlights
Backstrom is creative enough to get Forsberg the puck in shooting positions . They do it exactly how they do it for Ovechkin in Washington . Hornqvist gets to the front of the net to be the screen that makes Forsberg 's shot even tougher on goalies .
`` Whenever I have it I want to shoot it , '' Forsberg said . `` I want to say I 'm a good shooter and I want to prove it as well . ''
He 's drawing comparisons to Ovechkin , the best shooter and goal scorer in the game now . It 's safe to say he 's proven it .
`` I totally see it , '' said defenseman Mattias Ekholm , who also plays with Forsberg in Nashville . `` When they get the puck it 's like that ( snaps fingers ) , and then they score a goal . Their shot is amazing . Goalies just ca n't seem to stop the puck . That 's the case with Ovi too . ''
Central Security Forces ( CSF ) broke the two-hour-old truce that was reached between protesters and the police in mid-afternoon .
A video circulating on the internet shows how protesters chanting `` Peaceful , peaceful , peaceful '' as they stood in Mohamed Mahmoud Street were taken unawares and came under a sudden attack from security personnel .
Ahram Online reporters on the scene say that CSF troops started attacking protesters who were gathered peacefully in Mohamed Mahmoud Street near the entrance of Tahrir Square . CSF soldiers also attacked protesters in Falaki Square from the direction of Mohamed Mahmoud Street .
Mohamed Mahmoud Street , directly south of Tahrir , has been the scene of constant clashes and tear gas attacks by the police forces over the past five days .
The brief cessation of hostilities came as a result of a truce brokered by a number of independant figures and the Ministry of Interior .
The street is littered with debris from the battles and the smell of tear gas still permeates the air , stinging the eyes of protesters who walk back and forth chanting `` We will not leave , they [ SCAF ] should leave '' and `` Muslims and Christians are one hand . ''
`` The truce is only temporary , '' a protester had , propheticaly , told Ahram Online earlier in the afternoon as the people on the street made their way back to Tahrir Square .
`` It is only to give a chance to the general procecution [ who went to investigate the clashes ] to finish their mission . However we do n't trust the police . They might attack again at any time . ''
Many protesters went back to the square to rest . Meanwhile animal rights activists have been busy rescuing pets stranded in a petshop on the street .
Indeed , CSF armoured vehicles remained in streets leading to Tahrir Square during the two hours of relative calm .

More than 100,000 bees have been targeted by rustlers in the past month alone – and keepers fear the culprits are from their own ranks
There was a lump in Katie Hayward 's throat as they spoke about the emotional impact of the thefts that have cast a shadow over Britain 's beekeepers . “ The heartbreaking thing is that it 's a very close community . The fact that one beekeeper does this to another is the hardest thing of all , ” they say .
Two years have now passed since Hayward 's farm in north Wales was raided , leading to the loss of tens of thousands of bees . But the rustlers have continued to be active . Most recently they have targeted the property of one of their Anglesey neighbours , where around 40,000 bees were taken last month .
The heists have continued in other parts of the country , too . Earlier this month police in Norfolk were called after five hives thought to contain around 60,000 bees and £600 worth of honey were taken . Other known raids this year in Britain have included one in Doncaster in April . Suspicions among beekeepers that the culprits come from their own ranks were underlined by the fact that a bee smoker was left at the scene by someone who presumably knew that it could be used to calm the insects before taking them .
The problem is not restricted to the UK , either . The thefts are of an entirely different magnitude in California , where billions of bees are used to pollinate almond crops . But at least in the Golden State there has been some progress by investigators , who this summer arrested a man accused of stealing almost $ 1m worth of hives .
In Britain , where the British BeeKeepers Association ( BBKA ) has been urging members to microchip their hives for some time , the continuing mystery and the belief that the crimes are inside jobs are taking their toll .
“ The great tragedy is that this is members of our chapel , so to speak , stealing from other members , so it is very uncomfortable , ” said Tim Lovett , a BBKA past president , who said that the thefts and any subsequent extraction of honey would require know-how and access to equipment .
The crimes are taking place against the backdrop of a rise in the number of Britain 's beekeepers from 8,000 to 24,000 in the past decade thanks to successful membership drives that have also inflated the prices of a “ nucleus ” – a set of wooden frames , bees and a queen . Previously available for about £60 , their individual price is now close to £200 .
Hayward has a list of 23 people waiting for new hives from them for next year .
But whether the culprits are opportunists or suppliers to a hidden black market , Lovett predicted that the issue was likely to be the focus of deeper discussions among BBKA members .
“ I think that the way beekeepers can protect themselves most of all is by encouraging members to report dodgy behaviour and I 'm afraid that we have to get a bit of a ‘ bee-stazi ' going here , ” they said . “ Whereas the tendency is to trust everyone in your local association it may be time to become a little bit more questioning . ”
On the windswept north Anglesey coast , Hayward has already been taking steps in an even more hi-tech direction to supplement the noisy geese they have bought on police advice and the tracking cameras that they have concealed around them farm .
Soon , their hives will be fitted with equipment en route from the US which will measure humidity and temperature and have GPS tagging linked to them iPhone .
“ If someone lifts the lid off one of my hives I will know because the temperature will change , ” they explained at their honey farm and education centre . An award-winning enterprise whose activities include bee therapy work with troubled youngsters , Felin Honeybees was built up after Hayward had a stroke in 2012 and decided to leave a high-pressure project manager job for a pursuit which has been in their family for generations .
The 41-year-old was relaxing in the family home just yards away from the scene of the last raid when a witness saw a man in a beekeeper 's suit carrying some of Hayward 's hives to a car at around 9.30pm one evening .
It 's an experience they talk of in the context of their own personal circumstances – “ You know when you are living your dream and then someone comes along and sort of makes it a nightmare ? ” – and against the backdrop of a more widespread recent rise in rural crime .
The latter trend has seen claims for theft rise by more than 20 % in the first half of 2017 , according to the farm insurance company , NFU Mutual . A spokesperson there said it had noted “ a worrying number of beehive theft claims in recent months , including one claim for almost £10,000 ” .
While Hayward is full of praise for the specialist rural crime team in their area – a pioneering unit set up by North Wales Police – the National Farmers ' Union remains deeply concerned about the scale of burglaries , arson and vandalism experienced by rural communities .
Too often , the union says , farmers feel the police response is inadequate and the sentencing too lenient . It 's a view seemingly shared by one of the latest victims of bee rustling , Norfolk beekeeper Simon Greenwood , who told the Observer that police had taken some photos of the scene , fingerprinted a can and then sent them a letter to say no further action was being taken .
“ Then I had another letter to say they would be offering me counselling if I wanted it , which sort of made me laugh , ” said Greenwood , who is determined to press on with theirs business .
“ It has n't stopped me . It 's just made me more aware of where my hives are located and make sure they are in a more suitable , more secure place . Out of the way – out of sight , out of mind , ” they added .
Hayward was equally upbeat , and planning to donate one hive to help the neighbours who had been raided . “ You have to take it on the chin and carry on , ” they said .
While in Jerusalem Mitt Romney made an appearance at the Wailing Wall in a yarmulke . Was they just trying to pay tribute to Orthodox tradition or do they think he 's a Jew ? Perhaps both .
Conservative Christianity teaches “ supersessionism , ” the idea that God 's covenant with Christians replaced their covenant with the Jews and now Christians are the Chosen People , the spiritual heirs of Abraham . Mormonism takes this a step further , teaching that Mormons are not only the spiritual heirs of Abraham , they are their physical descendants as well .
Mormonism includes a ritual called the “ patriarchal blessing ” in which a member in good standing receives a set of pronouncements spoken by an older male who is thought , during the ritual itself , to act as a latter-day prophet . Like many of Mormonism 's better known distinctive features , such as plural marriage and wearing sacred undergarments , the practice was instituted by Joseph Smith himself . * One of the most central functions of the patriarchal blessing is to reveal which great-grandson of Abraham a person can claim as their ancestor . Per Mormonwiki :
`` Through these blessings , Latter-day Saints are told their lineage from the tribes of Israel . All tribes have been represented , but Latter-day Saints descend mostly from the sons of Joseph—Ephraim and Manasseh . ''
One former Mormon describes the experience : “ While reading my patriarchal blessing I took note that it says I was : ‘ born through the loins of Ephraim . ' I found it fascinating how patriarchs could tell which tribes people were descended from . ''
This peculiar-seeming teaching offers a fascinating window into the way sacred stories emerge and evolve . It also offers a window into one way religious sects compete and seek status .
In the Bible story , the Hebrew people are divided into 12 tribes based on the 12 sons of Jacob , one of whom is Joseph of the “ Technicolor Dreamcoat. ” The story of Jacob 's 12 sons and the 12 tribes of Israel bring together two passions of the Bible writers , both of which play a central role in Mormonism : genealogy and numerology . The concept of Chosen People creates a fixation on bloodlines , and the Bible writers often go to great lengths to establish the lineage of powerful men . In fact , two of the New Testament writers , each with a different audience in mind , offered contradictory genealogies of Jesus that theologians have struggled for centuries to reconcile . The Mormon religion continued and expanded the obsession with bloodlines to the point that vaults in Granite Mountain , Utah , now house almost two million rolls of microfilm with genealogical records . Mormonism teaches that family is forever , which is why a man controls their wife 's standing in heaven and members can be baptized on behalf of deceased antecedents , and it is terribly important to know who your ancestors were .
The number 12 traces its own lineage of significance clear back to the signs of the zodiac and manifests repeatedly in the Bible . Joseph Smith themselves was deeply influenced by Freemasonry , which provided the sacred symbols that appear on Mormon undergarments . It also reinforced a fascination with numerology and biblical numerology in particular .
Thus there were 12 signs of the Zodiac , 12 months in the year , 12 tribes of Israel , 12 stones in the pectoral , and 12 oxen supporting the molten sea in the Temple . There were 12 apostles in the new law , and the New Jerusalem has 12 gates , 12 foundations , is 12,000 furlongs square , and the number of the sealed is 12 times 12,000 .
The numbers three and seven also had early magical significance that shaped the beliefs of Bible writers and early Christians . Think seven days of creation , three days before the resurrection , the holy trinity , or the command to forgive your neighbor “ 70 times seven. ” Like the number 12 , three and seven are built into the structure of the Mormon bureaucracy .
It is often discussed within the community of exoplanet scientists that a danger lies in the description of intriguing exoplanets as “ Earth-like . ”
Nothing discovered so far warrants the designation , which is pretty nebulous anyway . Size and the planet 's distance from a host star are usually what earn it the title “ Earth-like , ” with its inescapable expectation of inherent habitability . But residing in a habitable zone is just the beginning ; factors ranging from the make-up of the planet 's host star to the presence and content of an atmosphere and whether it has a magnetic field can be equally important .
The recent announcement of the detection of a planet orbiting Proxima Centauri , the closest star to our own , set off another round of excitement about an “ Earth-like ” planet . It was generally not scientists who used that phrase — or if they did , it was in the context of certain “ Earth-like ” conditions . But the term nonetheless became a kind of shorthand for signalling a major discovery that just might some day even yield a finding of extraterrestrial life .
Consider , however , what is actually known about Proxima b :
The planet , which has a minimum mass of 1.3 Earths and a maximum of many Earths , orbits a red dwarf star . These are the most common class of star in the galaxy , and they put out considerably less luminosity than a star like our sun — about one-tenth of one percent of the power .
These less powerful red dwarf stars often have planets orbiting much closer to them than what 's found in solar systems like our own . Proxima b , for instance , circles the star in 11.3 days .
A consequence of this proximity is that the planet is most likely tidally locked by the gravitational forces of the star — meaning that the planet does not rotate like Earth does but rather has a daytime and nighttime side like our moon . Some now argue that a tidally locked planet could theoretically be habitable , but the consensus seems to be that it is an obstacle to habitability rather than a benefit .
The authors of the Proxima b paper make clear that evidence that the planet is rocky ( as opposed to gaseous ) is limited , and that 's why they label it as a “ candidate terrestrial planet . ”
So to describe Proxima b as “ Earth-like ” seems unfortunate to me , and prone to giving the public the misguided impression of a planet with blue skies , oceans , and fish swimming in them . Proxima b may have some very broadly defined characteristics that parallel Earth , but so do many other exoplanets that are definitely not habitable . And therein lies the really interesting part .
Before getting into that area , it should be made clear that the Proxima b detection was a game-changer , a discovery of historic proportions . It was and will be for a long time .
The detection , after all , provides the nearest opportunity possible for beginning to understand the extraordinary complexities of what makes a planet truly habitable — something that is far from understood today . And later , Proxima b may become a petri dish of sorts for identifying and measuring chemical signatures that could be a byproduct of some kind of life .
These are difficult tasks , to say the least , and will take an army of scientists years to come up with answers . But the good news is that the exoplanet field has already begun publishing papers on the dynamics and possible habitability of Proxima b , and they provide beginning insights into the issues , the excitement and the untold difficulties associated with this grandest of scientific chases .
Two Proxima papers that appeared soon after the August 24 announcement came from the University of Washington 's Virtual Planetary Laboratory . Supported by the NASA Astrobiology Institute since 2001 , it is a leader in exoplanet research , modelling and habitability The team , directed by Victoria Meadows , received the Proxima detection paper before it was released because of longstanding relationships with the lead author , Guillem Anglada-Escude .
The two papers from the VPL team — one with Meadows in the lead and the other organized by University of Washington astronomer Rory Barnes — take broad , interdisciplinary approaches to the planet .
“ Part one is what happened to this planet over time — what can we learn about its history , its evolution ? ” Meadows said . “ Part two is what does the history mean for the current environment right now ? We need photo-chemical models of what might be present , and then we have to look at what instruments we would need to detect what is decided we should be looking for . ”
The Barnes paper is here and the Meadows paper is here .
The two take on different tasks , but really are one . Both start with an appreciative nod to what will quickly become the planet that scientists want to study , and then they go into the extraordinary complexity of the task ahead .
As Barnes and their team concluded , a major obstacle to habitability on Proxima b is the well documented evolution of red dwarf stars .
While their energy output is relatively low when mature , they go through early phases when they are much brighter and send out enormous solar flares that can double their brightness in a matter of minutes . Barnes said these intense phases could easily sterilize a close-in planet , leaving it incapable of evolving into a potentially living world even if , a billion years later , conditions for life were much more favorable .
“ The planet is in a habitable zone and so could have had liquid water , but my biggest concern is the retention of that water , ” Barnes said of Proxima b . “ If the planet was formed in its current orbit , then it was baked enough for 100 , 200 million years to form a runaway greenhouse effect. ” A different dynamic may have resulted in the same results on Venus , which once was wet but now is super-hot and parched .
This leads to the next big question : Could Proxima b have been formed elsewhere , and was later pushed or pulled to its current location ? Barnes said it is certainly possible that the planet spent its early years much further from Proxima Centauri , and they said that the ( relatively ) nearby presence of much larger star Alpha Centauri A and B certainly could have had dramatic effects on the locations and evolution of the planet .
For these reasons and many more , Barnes said , there is absolutely no way to conclude now that Proxima b either is , or is not , potentially habitable .
The VPL group specializes in modeling possible planetary scenarios based on particular proposed condition . The team gets an idea of whether a planet might be habitable based on the history and potential current atmospheric and surface characteristics introduced into the model .
In the paper they led , Meadows and their team reported :
“ We used coupled climate-photochemistry models to simulate several plausible states for the current environment of Proxima Cen b , for those various evolutionary scenarios . We find several post-runaway { greenhouse } states that are uninhabitable either due to extreme water loss or inclement surface temperatures . In particular , a dense Venus-like CO2 atmosphere will result in extremely high surface temperatures at Proxima Cen 's current semi-major axis .
“ However , several evolutionary scenarios may lead to possibly habitable planetary environments , including O2-rich atmospheres that retain a remnant ocean after extreme water loss . ”
So the conclusion of the VPL effort is that we really have no idea now whether Proxima b might be habitable , but the joined papers move the discussion significantly further by describing scenarios where the planet definitely would not be habitable , and some where it just might be .
These are essential guidepost for astronomers to know when actually observing Proxima b , which will surely become a target for many a telescope . To make an important discovery , it 's definitely useful to know what you 're looking for .
Meadows also looked into which telescopes have capacities to make the needed observations , and concluded that large ground-based telescopes have a role to play , though with current technology it will be a very challenging one . But given the possible results , they said , “ I ca n't image they would n't make the upgrades happen as fast a possible . ”
And then there 's the James Webb Space Telescope ( JWST ) , due to launch in 2018 . Because it observes in the infrared section of the spectrum , it is able to measure heat signatures with precision . And that opens some exciting possibilities .
Meadows and their team laid them out , and so did Harvard astronomer Laura Kreidberg , in a paper for The Astrophysical Journal with Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics theoretical physicist and cosmologist Abraham Loeb .
As Loeb explained in an email : “ As the planet orbits around the star , we should see a changing fraction of its day side , similarly to the phases of the Earth 's moon . The changing color of the planet as it orbits the star provides evidence for the temperature contrast between its day and night sides .
“ This contrast has an extreme value for bare rock , but is moderated by an atmosphere or an ocean that transfers heat across the planet 's surface . Our paper shows that JWST will be able to distinguish between these cases with high significance after observing the planet for a full orbital time of 11 days . ”
In other words , the temperature difference between the planet 's day side and its night side will be larger than expected if there is no atmosphere. , and lower than expected if there is .
Determining that there is an atmosphere present , Loeb said , would substantially increase the chances that Proxima b is , or once was , habitable . The first order would be to look for things like oxygen , water vapor , and methane , which could indicate habitable conditions if not active biological processes .
This is a very difficult task because it requires the ability to catch starlight as it bounces off or filters through the planet 's atmosphere . They said that while the JWST might be able to detect a few compounds including ozone , full atmospheric analysis will have to wait for future ground-based observatories like the European Extremely Large Telescope , which is expected to see first light in the mid-2020s . Ultimately , it will take a direct imaging space telescope like the one being proposed for a launch in the 2030s to answer many of the important questions .
So the process of getting to really know Proxima b , of learning more than its promising but less-than-revealing location and mass is about to begin .
It 's exciting for sure , and not because Proxima b is “ Earth-like. ” Rather , there 's the real possibility of finding a habitable planet that — except in some grand-scale structural ways — is really not so “ Earth-like ” at all .
' I regret my £5,000 NHS boobs and now I want them reduced ... for free ' : Model claims 36DD breasts are stopping them getting work
Josie , 23 , had £4,800 surgery on the NHS in January
Claimed they were bullied due to lack of breast tissue and small bust
Went from a 32A to a 36DD to pursue their dream of being a glamour model
Says new breasts stop them getting modelling work and they have been abused
Wants the implants removed on the NHS 'because they made them so big '
A part-time model who had a £4,800 breast enlargement at taxpayers ' expense has said they now want the implants removed , and is expecting the NHS to foot the bill once more .
Josie Cunningham , 23 , has said rather than improving their life their breast enhancement surgery has left them feeling self-conscious and has led to bullying , so they want them removed .
The aspiring model hit the headlines earlier this year when they had their breasts increased from a 32A to 36DD on the NHS as they said they were being bullied for their smaller cleavage .

Josie had their £4,800 breast enlargement surgery on the NHS in January but now wants their chest reduced
Josie says that although they hoped the operation would help their career , they have found that their bigger breasts have made them self-conscious . Pictured left , Josie before the enhancement and , right , after
Despite appearing in numerous publications to show off their new bustier look , the mother-of-two is now claiming that their new curves are preventing them from finding work .
Speaking to Closer magazine Josie , from Leeds , says : ‘ They 're so big I find them embarrassing and I do n't feel I can do any modelling because they 've attracted so much negative attention .. I 'm thinking about having a reduction on the NHS .
‘ I 'm looking into charities that could help , but I think it 's down to the NHS because they made them so big , ' they argue .
Not totally oblivious to the plight of many who wait months on NHS waiting lists due to lack of budgets , Josie says of their use of taxpayer money : ' I feel awful when I hear about people in need who are refused treatment , but I do n't decide who the NHS helps . '
'There 's a queue and we 're all in it together . If it was my child that was ill I 'd move heaven and earth , like any parent , but I do n't make the rules . '
The case caused outrage last month after it was revealed the NHS had funded Josie 's operation while just a few miles away two-year-old Oliver Dockerty , who suffers from cerebral palsy , had been turned down for funding for an operation which could allow them to walk .
At the time their mother Claire said : 'Oliver has splints on their legs , a flexi-stand as they have n't got any balance , and uses a walking frame to get around .
Josie has previously flaunted their new breasts and even used this outfit to offer a tribute to the NHS for paying for their implants
Josie 's two hour operation was performed after a seven month wait , and took them from a 32A to a 36DD cup
'He wants to be jumping in muddy puddles like Peppa Pig . They want to be kicking a football and they ca n't jump on a trampoline . I 'd love to see them walking unaided for their first day at primary school .
' I 'm a single parent and I do n't have that kind of money . Even if they look again at the decision , there 's going to be a big backlog of children like Oliver waiting to have this done . '
The full interview is available in this weeks Closer
After the story appeared in the Daily Mail a deluge of support from readers contributed to the £24,000 raised in just one day on a fundraising web page set up for Oliver .
Following the operation , h oping their new bust line would help their dream career as a glamour model , Josie went to the media with their story , but found themselves at the receiving end of abuse .
They claim they were taunted trough social media and even shouted at down the street with people demanding their money back .
‘ I do n't want to spend my life known as the girl with the massive NHS boobs , so having smaller implants is the only option , ' they say .
Josie was granted the initial breast surgery as they had a congenial medical condition which meant they had no breast tissue .
The part-time retail assistant was bullied from the age of 16 for their flat chest and said their breast did n't even grow during their two pregnancies .
Placed on a waiting list in 2012 , Josie had the two-hour operation seven months later at St James 's Hospital in Leeds .
They said : 'People do n't understand that I deserved the surgery .
' I was born without breast tissue . I 'm as worthy as anyone else . And I thought working as a model would be a good way of paying back into the system through tax . '
However , they now hope to re-join a waiting list for surgery to have the implants removed .
Unsurprisingly their story has caused upset , particularly as a drive to cut an additional £20 billion from the NHS budget has recently been announced .
Chief executive of the tax payers alliance Matthew Sinclair says : ‘ It is ridiculous that taxpayers paid for this surgery in the first place . '
Wendy Maeda/Globe Staff The Post did not identify the pair by name , but friends and co-workers recognized them , the suit said .
A Massachusetts teenager and their 24-year-old friend filed a defamation lawsuit against the New York Post Wednesday in Boston , accusing the tabloid of falsely portraying them as suspects in the deadly Marathon bombings by plastering their photograph on the front page under the headline , “ Bag Men . ”
The lawsuit filed in Suffolk Superior Court said the photographs and articles published three days after the bombings made it appear that FBI agents were pursuing Salaheddin Barhoum and Yassine Zaimi , avid runners watching the Marathon . That evening , authorities released photographs of the suspected bombers , Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev .
In the complaint , lawyers for Barhoum , a 16-year-old Revere High School student , and Zaimi , a part-time college student from Malden who also works full time , accused the New York Post of libel , negligent infliction of emotional distress , and invasion of privacy . They are seeking damages , including unspecified monetary compensation .

“ The front page would lead a reasonable reader to believe that plaintiffs had bombs in their bags , that they were involved in causing the Boston Marathon bombing , ” according to the court complaint . The lawsuit asserts the newspaper subjected the friends to “ scorn , hatred , ridicule , or contempt in the minds of a considerable and respectable segment of the community . ”

The New York Post declined to comment Wednesday , but editor Col Allan defended the coverage in April , telling the Associated Press they accurately reported that the image was e-mailed to law enforcement officials seeking information about the men . “ We did not identify them as suspects , ” Allan said .
Barhoum and Zaimi are legal residents who came to the United States from Morocco about four years ago after being granted visas , according to court records and their lawyers .
Zaimi came to the United States alone and met the Barhoum family when they were tenants in the same house , lawyers said . They got a job at a sandwich shop five days after they arrived in this country and now works at a financial services firm while studying business part time .
They also love to run , lawyers said , which is why they and Barhoum , who runs track in Revere , went to the Marathon finish line early that day naively hoping to run the race . Zaimi had run a 5-kilometer race the previous year that started there and they mistakenly thought the Marathon started at the same spot . But Marathon officials told them the starting line was 26.2 miles away .

Feeling sheepish , they stayed and chatted with Kenyans and Ethiopians who had gathered to cheer elite runners . Two hours before the bombs went off , the pair left .
In the frenzied hunt for the bombers , photographs of the finish line crowd surfaced on online sites such as Reddit , according to the complaint .
On April 17 , friends alerted Zaimi and Barhoum that their photos were online , their lawyers said . That night , the friends decided to go to police .
Authorities questioned both men , then told them they were not suspects , their lawyers said . Zaimi and Barhoum went home .
Earlier that day , the FBI had urged news organizations to exercise restraint because of several erroneous reports .

The next day , Zaimi and Barhoum appeared on the New York Post 's front page . A smaller headline said federal officials were looking for them .
A short article on the front page said there is “ no direct evidence linking them to the crime , but authorities want to identify them. ” Inside the newspaper , more photographs showed their faces next to a longer article that did not identify Zaimi and Barhoum , but friends , co-workers and classmates recognized them .
Lawyers said the coverage clearly implied that Zaimi and Barhoum were suspects .
“ They 're saying these are the guys with the bombs in the bag , ” said William Barrett , one of Zaimi 's lawyers .
At first , Barhoum and Zaimi were unaware of the article .
When Zaimi arrived at work that day , a company vice president called them into their office . Zaimi did not understand why until the office manager showed them a copy of the Post .
“ He immediately started shaking , their mouth went dry , and they felt as though they were having a panic attack , ” the complaint said .
Zaimi spent the day in a back room at work , where lawyers said their supervisors and co-workers have been very supportive .
That night , the complaint said , as they waited for the train home , someone pointed them out as the person in the New York Post . Zaimi fled .
Barhoum , who was on spring break , went to a track meet that morning . When they arrived home , a crowd of reporters was inside their house , questioning their parents . One reporter showed them an image of the New York Post .
Barhoum , according to the complaint , became “ terrified , began to shake and sweat , and felt dizzy and nauseous . ”
Zaimi has sought counseling for depression and refuses to go running . Though they have friends , they have no family in the United States .
“ All of their enjoyment came from the running world , and that 's no longer part of their life , ” said Barrett . “ He feels like he 's being watched all the time . ”
Max Stern , one of Barhoum 's lawyers , accused the newspaper of racial profiling and said they would ask the court to compel the Post to divulge the source of its information .
“ What kind of stereotyping and profiling , what type of reasoning , led the Post to think this was OK to do ? ” they said . “ And would they have ever done this if this was just some white kid from the suburbs who was standing there with the backpack ? ”

Brian Muir , the legendary artist who sculpted the original Darth Vader helmet based on Ralph McQuarrie 's designs , recently announced on Twitter that they began work on Star Wars : Rogue One . It 's a fair assumption that , since Rogue One tells the tale of a group of Rebels on a quest to retrieve the plans for Death Star I , Muir will be sculpting new armor for classic Stormtroopers , new characters , and perhaps an updated version of the Dark Lord of the Sith himself . The evolution of Darth Vader from whiny teenager to most feared man in the galaxy left fans flat , but visual development of the character documented by Michael Kaminski at their Secret History Of Star Wars site is an interesting read .

Darth Vader became an iconic silver screen villain the moment their pitch-black silhouette first appeared against the stark white background of Princess Leia 's Tantive IV . Even after Vader turned face and dropped the Emperor down the shaft of Death Star II , their reputation as a bad guy preceded him . Even before it was revealed that Anakin Skywalker cut down a classroom full of younglings , America 's other favorite child murderer , Freddy Krueger , was called “ the most popular cinematic maniac since Darth Vader ” by Newsweek . Kaminski 's piece details the evolution of Darth Vader from their humble beginnings as an Imperial General in early drafts of The Star Wars to their final cinematic appearance .
McQuarrie 's earliest sketches depict a man similar to Valorum or General Vader from the first draft , being tall and with a flowing cape , however a distinguishing feature is that the character wears what looks like a sort of futuristic gas mask over their face . McQuarrie explains that it is a personal respirator , because the character had to cross through space from the Imperial Star Destroyer to the rebel cruiser . “ Early in the script there was a description of Vader crossing between two ships in space so I created this mask so they could breathe in space , ” McQuarrie explains . “ George loved it . ”
Of course , the respirator became more than a spacesuit necessary for breathing in a vacuum and became a distinguishing characteristic of Vader , with the villain wearing the space suit throughout the film by the fourth draft . While it certainly retained the mystery of the character , it did rob audiences of the concept of Vader drinking “ casually from a flask ” similair to a Nazi villain in a World War II film . According to Kaminski 's piece , Vader became more and more influenced by The Lightning from the 1930 's Devil Dogs serial and Doctor Doom .

The design that finally made it to the screen in 1977 's Star Wars , as sculpted by Brian Muir , was asymmetrical , with a red tint to the eyes . According to Dressing A Galaxy : The Costumes Of Star Wars , the costume was mocked up from a World War II German stahlhelm gas mask , a monk 's cloak , a leather under-suit , and a metal breastplate . This kind of hodgepodge look combined with the grit and grime present on the helmet was part of the lived-in universe that George Lucas and their team were going for with Star Wars . Even the most pedantic Star Wars fan may not have noticed how Vader 's costume changed from film to film . The helmet design in The Empire Strikes Back eliminates the red eyes and more sinister looking brow with a pronounced widows peak and adds a more detailed chest box . Also , the costume in Empire displays Vader 's shoulder pads—covered up by robes in the original—in order to give them a more robotic appearance . Vader is certainly glossier by Return Of The Jedi but mostly retains the look of Empire 's design . The helmet received a redesign especially for the unmasking scene at the film 's climax .
When Vader returned to the screen for the first time since 1983 in Revenge Of The Sith , a completely new helmet was constructed . The helmet seen in Sith marked the use of a perfectly symmetrical Darth Vader mask , subtlety giving the villain a more robotic look .
Michael Kaminski 's book , The Secret History Of Star Wars , can be purchased on Amazon .
Update : Unfortunately , since version 2 was released , Malwarebytes is no longer working properly . In fact I have seen on several computers where it is messing up other programs , including my clients ' online file backup software . I am recommending that Malwarebytes be uninstalled . The security software we now use and recommend is here .
I have been using and recommending Malwarebytes ( the paid version ) for many years now . It 's a great tool , and provides a good level of security in addition to your antivirus program . Malwarebytes recently announced that their business model is changing . This means that you have a window of opportunity to take advantage of their current pricing , because it will soon change permanently from a single payment lifetime license to an annual subscription .
As a refresher –
Malwarebytes has 2 options for their antispyware program . You can get the free version or the paid version .
The free version installs on your computer , and you can run it whenever you want to do a scan . When you run it , it will update itself and scan your drives for any malicious software , then remove it for you . But , if you never run it , it wo n't do anything other than sit on your computer .
The paid version runs all the time in the background ( you can see it in the System Tray when it 's running ) . This means it will block that stuff from coming into your computer in the first place . Also , the paid version has a Website Blocker , so it will pop up a warning if you are about to click through to a malicious or infected website .
In my opinion , your computer will be properly protected if you use Microsoft Security Essentials ( free antivirus ) in combination with the paid version of Malwarebytes .
For many years , Malwarebytes has charged $ 24.95 for the paid version . This is a lifetime license for your computer . And in fact you could install Malwarebytes on your next computer and use the same license codes . This was a great deal ( and you even get a discount if you purchased licenses for 2 or more computers at the same time ) .
That is now changing .
Malwarebytes is about to come out with version 2 , and with the introduction of that , they are changing to an annual subscription . The new pricing will be $ 24.95 per year . In addition , this one license will be good for 3 computers .
Here is the important thing to note : at the time of this blog post , you can still purchase the lifetime license for the single payment of $ 24.95 . You can get it here . ( Note : that 's an affiliate link , so when you purchase from that link they will pay me a small commission . )
Some questions and answers :
Question : When is the price officially going to go up to the annual subscription model ?
Answer : Malwarebytes has not announced a specific date when version 2 will be released and the subscription model will go into effect .
Question : If I buy the lifetime license now , will I still get version 2 when it is released ?
Answer : Yes
I am one of the beta testers for the version 2 software , and I really like it . It has a much more modern interface , and it 's easy to use . I have it installed on my Windows 8 computer , so by the time you get the full release version 2 I will be very familiar with it and can help you configure it if needed .
Personally , I am glad they are changing to the annual subscription model . The one-time payment for a lifetime license was really way underpriced . The company provides daily updates to the malware definitions , which requires a lot of resources to keep up with . Plus they have come out with a new version of the program a few times , which is also expensive . By creating a more predictable cash flow annually , it will enable them to invest more into new products and development , and we will all benefit from that by having a safer computer experience .
Another positive from this is that Malwarebytes did not opt to keep the product free but put in advertising or junk downloads or toolbars . I would rather pay a few dollars for a product annually than have to navigate through all that garbage .
Finally , you should go check out their site at Malwarebytes.org . They have a LOT more software than just Malwarebytes , and several are free :
File Assassin : got a file on your computer that you ca n't delete because Windows says it is locked ? Unlock it with this program ( free )
got a file on your computer that you ca n't delete because Windows says it is locked ? Unlock it with this program ( free ) Reg Assassin : cleans out malware entries in your computer 's registry ( free ) .
cleans out malware entries in your computer 's registry ( free ) . Malwarebytes Anti-Rootkit : finds rootkits ( malware that works at the root of your C drive ) and gets rid of them . Note that this is a product currently in beta testing stage ( free ) .

Team communication service Slack today announced a new product designed to help its software scale to organizations with tens of thousands of employees . It 's called Slack Enterprise Grid , and it 's essentially a rethinking of the core app . It takes new features , critical design changes , and other alterations that make Slack easier to use and more efficient for corporations that are large and sprawling .
For those familiar with Slack , this new product does n't change much about how you use the app to communicate with your co-workers , get work done , and go about your day . For those in administrative roles , however , Slack Enterprise Grid is supposed to tackle how large companies are organized and how a myriad number of smaller teams are able to work together .
Slack is tailoring itself for companies with tens of thousands of employees
For instance , now companies will be able to create an unlimited number of “ workspaces , ” which is Slack 's parlance for different instances of its app that have a one unified login system and various channels . As it stands today , a company of maybe 500 people relies on just one Slack workspace . For a company with , say , 18,000 employees , this does n't work — or at least not as well as it should . What ends up happening is that smaller teams within a company use Slack while remaining disconnected from the way the rest of the organization operates , the company says .
Now , Slack says marketing can have one workspace , while sales can have another . Customers of this new enterprise version will have the ability to talk across teams with shared channels , while an administrative layer helps wrap everything together . That means you can still find and message co-workers in Slack who work in entirely different departments , and features like search allow you to pull data , files , or messages from across every available channel and team you 're a part of .
Slack is quick to point out that its existing standard and plus tiers are not necessarily unfit for larger organizations . “ Slack has worked with some of the largest companies in the world . We have many customers that have 2,000 , 5,000 , 10,000 people at their companies , ” says Slack co-founder Stewart Butterfield . “ But it 's been a slow organic bottom-up evolution. ” In other words , small teams pick up on Slack and then spread it to the rest of the company , or as far as it can go . What the Enterprise Grid product allows for , Butterfield points out , is a smoother , faster , and more complete transition from a previous system over to Slack .
The company , which has about 5 million people logging in every day , hopes to expand its customer base to some of the largest industries in the world . Slack says it now has FINRA and HIPAA certifications , so it can be used by health care companies and large medical organizations . It 's also adding security and privacy integrations with encryption , data loss prevention providers , and other third parties that should help Slack be more appealing to companies in finance , government , and telecommunications . As of today , the company says it 's already deployed its new enterprise product to companies like IBM , PayPal , and Capital One .
Slack 's new product is being used by IBM and PayPal
Yet as Slack moves into larger companies , it will have to contend with the reality of how slow-moving , legacy industries work . That means wrestling with the notion that a new communication tool and another app to contend with might create more noise , especially as employees juggle email and other workflow necessities that Slack wo n't be able to completely eliminate . To that end , Butterfield says the company 's SLI team , for Search , Learning and Intelligence , is working on new methods to harness artificial intelligence to combat information overload .
Some of these include more robust universal search , daily briefings , and channel highlights to help people make sense of what 's happening on Slack without spending hours reading backlogs and catching up . Slack 's early investment in bots helps in this respect , but in a greater sense it involves more serious investment in how to make sense of human language and train software to understand what 's truly important . “ There 's a holy grail for us and this is not just a single feature we 're going to launch , ” Butterfield says . “ This is a multi-decade quest , to try to harvest that info out of the conversations people are already having and making it available to people . ”
A few weeks back , I put out a call for funding . So far , two generous individuals have stepped up to help , enabling me to spend much more time on Perl 6 than would otherwise have been possible .
First in line was Nick Logan ( ugexe ) , who is funding 60 hours to get a longstanding I/O bug resolved . The problem , in short , has been that a synchronous socket ( that is , an IO : :Socket : :INET instance ) accepted or connected on one thread could not be read from or written to by another thread . The same has been true of synchronous file handles and processes .
The typical answer for the socket case has been to use IO : :Socket : :Async instead . While that 's the best answer from a scalability perspective , many people new to Perl 6 will first reach for the more familiar synchronous socket API and , having heard about Perl 6 's concurrency support , will pass those off to a thread , probably using a start block . Having that fail to work is a bad early impression .
For processes , the situation has been similar ; a Proc was bound to the thread it was created on , and the solution was to use Proc : :Async . For situations where dealing with more than one of the input or output streams is desired , I 'd argue that it 's actually easier to deal with it correctly using Proc : :Async . However , Proc has also ended up with a few features that Proc : :Async has not so far offered .
Finally , there are “ file handles ” – that is , instances of IO : :Handle . Here , we typically would get away with passing handles of ordinary files around between threads , and due to an implementation detail could get away with it . The situation of an IO : :Handle backed by a TTY or pipe was much less pleasing , however , which was especially unfortunate because it afflicted all of $ * IN , $ * OUT , and $ * ERR . The upshot was that you could only read from $ * IN from the main thread . While writing to $ * OUT and $ * ERR worked , it was skating on thin ice ( and occasionally falling through it ) .
How did we get into this situation ?
To understand the issue , we need to take a look at the history of MoarVM I/O . In its first year of its life , MoarVM was designed and built on a pretty extreme budget – that is to say , there was n't one . Building platform abstractions was certainly not a good use of limited time , so a library was brought in to handle this . Initially , MoarVM used the Apache Portable Library , which served us well .
As the concurrent and parallel language features of Perl 6 came into focus , together with asynchronous I/O , it became clear that libuv – the library that provides I/O and platform abstractions for Node.js – was a good option for supporting this . Since the APR and libuv had substantially overlapping feature sets , we decided to move over to using libuv . In the months that followed , a bunch of the asynchronous features found in Perl 6 today quickly fell in to place : Proc : :Async , IO : :Socket : :Async , IO : :Notification , asynchronous timers , and signal handlers . All seemed to be going well .
Alas , we 'd made a problem for ourselves . libuv is centered around event loops . Working with an event loop is conceptually simple : we provide callbacks to be run when certain things happen ( like data arriving over a socket , or a timer elapsing ) , and enter the event loop . The loop waits for some kind of event to happen , and then invokes the correct callback . Those callbacks may lead to other callbacks being set up ( for example , the callback reacting to an incoming socket connection can set up a callback to be called whenever data arrives over that socket ) . This is a fine low-level programming model – and a good bit nicer than dealing with things like poll sets . However , a libuv event loop runs on a single thread . And handles are tied to the libuv event loop that they were created on .
For IO : :Socket : :Async and Proc : :Async , this is not a problem . MoarVM internally runs a single event loop for all asynchronous I/O , timers , signals , and so forth . Whenever something happens , it pushes a callback into the queue of a scheduler ( most typically that provided by ThreadPoolScheduler ) , where the worker threads lie in wait to handle the work . Since this event loop serves as a pure dispatcher , not running any user code or even such things as Unicode decoding , it 's not really limiting to have it only on a single thread .
When the synchronous I/O was ported from the APR , none of this was in place , however . Therefore , each thread got its own libuv event for handling the synchronous I/O . At the time , of course , there was n't really much in the way of threading support available in Rakudo on MoarVM . Therefore , at that point in time , that an event loop was tied to a thread was not problematic . It only came to be an issue as the concurrency support in Perl 6 became mature enough that people started using it…and then running into the limitation .
Seizing an opportunity
Having to deal with this was a chance to spend some quality time improving the lower level bits of I/O in the MoarVM/NQP/Rakudo stack , which have had very little love over the last couple of years . Recently , Zoffix did a bunch of great work on the higher level parts of I/O . Most helpfully for my endeavor , they also greatly improved the test coverage of I/O , meaning I could refactor the lower level bits with increased confidence .
A while back , I took the step of fully decoupling MoarVM 's asynchronous I/O from character encoding/decoding . For some months now , MoarVM has only provided support for asynchronous byte-level I/O . It also introduced a streaming decoder , which can turn bytes into characters for a bunch of common encodings ( ASCII , UTF-8 , and friends ) . This means that while the decoding hot paths are provided by the VM , the coordination is moved up to the Perl 6 level .
With synchronous I/O , the two were still coupled , with the runtime directly offering both character level and byte level I/O . While this is in some ways convenient , it is also limiting . It blocks us from supporting user-provided encodings – at least , not in such a way that they can just be plugged in and used with a normal IO : :Handle . That aside , there are also situations where one might like to access the services provided by a streaming decoder when not dealing with an I/O handle . ( A streaming decoder is one you can feed bytes to incrementally and pull characters out , trusting that it will do the right thing with regard to multi-byte and multi-codepoint sequences . )
Whatever changes were going to have to happen to fix the thread limitations of synchronous I/O , it was quite clear that only having to deal with binary I/O there would make it easier . Therefore , a plan was hatched :
Re-work the synchronous I/O handles to use only binary I/O , and coordinate with the VM-backed decoder to handle char I/O . Rip out the synchronous char I/O . Re-implement the remaining synchronous binary I/O , so as not to be vulnerable to the threading limitations .
Making it possible to support user-defined encodings would be a future step , but the work done in This refactors would make it a small step – indeed , one that will only require work at a Perl 6 level , not any further down the stack . While it may well end up being me that does this anyway , it 's at least now in reach for a bunch more members of the Perl 6 development team .
Sockets first
I decided to start out with sockets . From a technical perspective , this made sense because they were the most isolated ; break IO : :Handle and suddenly such things as say are busted , and both it and Proc are used in the pre-compilation management code too . Conveniently , sockets were also Nick 's primary interest , so it was nice to get the most important goal of the work delivered first .
The streaming decode API , while fully implemented on MoarVM , had only been partially implemented on the JVM . Therefore , to complete the work on sockets without busting them on the JVM , I had to implement the missing pieces of the VM-backed streaming decode API . This meant dealing with NIO ( “ New IO ” ) , the less about which is said the better . I 'm pretty sure the buffer API was n't designed to trip me up at every turn , but it seems to reliably manage to do so . Since file handles on the JVM would soon also come to depend on this code , it was nice to be able to get it at least straight enough to be passing all of the sockets tests , plus another set of lower-level tests that live in the NQP repository .
Refactoring the socket code itself gave a good opportunity for cleanups . The IO : :Socket : :INET class does the IO : :Socket role , the idea being that at some point other implementations that provide things like domain sockets will also do that role , and just add the domain socket specific parts . In reviewing what methods were where , it became clear that some things that really belonged in the IO : :Socket role were not , so I moved them there as part of the work . I also managed to eliminate all of the JVM-specific workarounds in the socket code along the way , which was also a happy outcome .
With that refactored , I could rip out the character I/O support from sockets in MoarVM . This left me with a relatively small body of code doing binary socket I/O using libuv , implementing synchronous socket I/O atop of its asynchronous event loop . When it comes to sockets , there are two APIs to worry about : the Berkeley/BSD/POSIX one , and Winsock . Happily , in my case , there was a lot of overlap and just a handful of places that I had to deal with divergence . The extra lines spent coping with the difference were more than paid back by not faking synchronous I/O in terms of an asynchronous event loop .
File handles next
Buoyed by this success , it was time to dig into file handles . The internals of IO : :Handle were poked into from outside of the class : a little in IO : :Path and more so in Proc , which was actually setting up IO : :Pipe , a subclass of IO : :Handle . Thankfully , with a little refactoring , the encapsulation breakage could be resolved . Then it was a case of refactoring to use the streaming decode API rather than the character I/O . This went relatively smoothly , though it also uncovered a previously hidden bug in the JVM implementation of the streaming decoder , which I got fixed up .
So , now to rip the character file I/O out of MoarVM and refactor the libuv away in synchronous file handles too ? Alas , not so fast . NQP was also using these operations . Worse , it did n't even have an IO handle object ! Everything was done in terms of nqp : :ops instead . So , I introduced an NQP IO handle class , gave it many of the methods that its Perl 6 big sister has , and refactored stuff to use it .
With that blocker out of the way , I could move on to sorting things out down in MoarVM . Once again , synchronous file I/O looks similar enough everywhere to not need all that much in the way of an abstraction layer . On Windows , it turned out to be important to put all of the handles into binary mode , however , since we do our own
< - > \r
mapping . ( Also , yes , it is very much true that it 's only very similar on Windows if you use their POSIX API emulation . It 's possible there may be a performance win from not using that , but I ca n't imagine it 'll be all that much . )
Not entirely standard
So , all done ? Well , not quite . For the standard handles , we only used the synchronous file code path when the handle was actually a regular file . This is not the common case ; it 's often a pipe or a TTY . These used a completely different code path in libuv , using its streams API instead of the files API .
Thankfully , there is n't much reason to retain this vast implementation difference . With a little work on EOF handling , and re-instating the faking of tell , it was possible to use the same code I had written to handle regular files . This worked out very easily on Linux . On Windows , however , a read operation would blow up if reading from the console .
Amazingly , the error string was “ out of space ” , which was a real head-scratcher given it was coming from a read operation ! It turned out that the error string was a tad misleading ; the error code is # define d as ENOMEM , so a better error string would have been “ out of memory ” . That still made little sense . So I went digging into the native console APIs on Windows , and discovered that reads from the console are allocated out of a 64KB buffer , which is also used for various other things . 64KB should be enough for anybody , I guess . Capping read requests to a console on Windows to 16KB was enough to alleviate this .
Job done !
At least , for IO : :Socket : :INET and IO : :Handle , which now are not tied to a thread on HEAD of MoarVM/NQP/Rakudo . The work on processes is ongoing , although due to be completed in the coming week . So , I 'll talk about that in my next post here .

Shooting 4K usually means making a choice between getting a good price and good image quality , but today Sony is introducing a new camcorder that tries to give consumers both . The new 4K Handycam FDR-AX100 is a relatively compact camcorder capable of shooting 4K video at both 24 and 30P . But more importantly : it has one of Sony 's larger sensors for a camcorder , and it 'll sell for about $ 1,999.99 — a comparably low price for high-quality 4K footage .
Sony 's serious about bokeh
The FDR-AX100 's 1-inch sensor is n't one of the biggest out there , but it 's the same size as what Sony puts into its RX100 compact camera , which still manages to take photos that look great . Sony promises that 'll follow through to the AX100 too , and the footage we saw from it looked promising . In Sony 's press release , it also reiterates several times over that this camera will be capable of capturing `` beautiful bokeh '' with ease .
The camera is clearly targeted toward enthusiasts , though . It has built-in NFC and Wi-Fi , allowing it to stream video to a TV or be controlled from a smartphone . And as consumer camcorders tend to , the FDR-AX100 has a wide-angle lens — 29mm — with a large optical zoom range of up to 12x .
While this is Sony 's second 4K camcorder , it stands out from the first in a big way . The earlier model , Sony 's FDR-AX1 , has a much larger price : $ 4,499.99 . The AX100 is also 74 percent smaller and 66 percent lighter than the AX1 , making it much more appropriate for home shooters than enthusiast filmmakers .
Of course , getting 4K content from the new camera to anywhere other than a local TV is still challenging work . But with cameras like the FDR-AX100 making it just as easy for home filmmakers to shoot 4K as it is for Hollywood studios , streaming services may just have to catch up fast .
Strategists at both campaigns believe the series of October face-offs could be critical in determining who wins the White House this fall . But they are not eager to wade into the office politics of the selection process .
“ Nothing to say , but thanks for the opportunity , ” Ben Ginsberg , the chief debate negotiator for Mr. Romney 's campaign , said in an e-mail message .

But despite the denials from all sides , veteran political operatives say it is understood that campaign aides will find ways to communicate their wishes to the commission members — at cocktail parties , in casual conversations over drinks or in “ chance ” encounters .
The commission ruled out picking one of the top three network news anchors , knowing how the other two might react . Mr. Lehrer had sworn they would never moderate a presidential debate again , perhaps in part because of the criticism they received in 2000 that they were not aggressive enough , prompting them to scoff , “ If somebody wants to be entertained , they ought to go to the circus . ”
When commission members asked if they would change their mind , they initially answered with a Shermanesque statement : “ If drafted , I will not run ; if nominated , I will not accept ; if elected , I will not serve . ”

But they were eventually persuaded , they said , by a new debate format : six distinct 15-minute segments , with candidates getting two minutes to respond to questions , with the remaining time left for a deeper exploration of a topic .
“ He sniffed around when they got the new format and became interested again , ” said one television official who , like the others involved in the process , would not speak for the record because the discussions were private . “ There is always lobbying that goes on , but people were surprised that this is who they ended up with . ”
Fox News , which is the only independent television network that has not been selected to have one of its anchors host a debate , made an aggressive push this year . The commission sent signals that the network was in strong contention , people familiar with the process said , but that changed in the last month . The Obama campaign raised questions about the network because of its conservative leanings . The Romney campaign objected to MSNBC because of its liberal bent and threatened to boycott if one of its anchors was selected .

Mr. Schieffer , known as “ Schieff ” to several members of the commission , was seen by participants as a likely moderator from the beginning . Wolf Blitzer of CNN was believed to be a leading contender , but a desire for diversity elevated Ms. Crowley , after Mr. Lehrer and Mr. Schieffer were already in place , according to people familiar with the discussions .
On Friday , Rush Limbaugh railed against Ms. Crowley ( “ a far , far left-wing Democrat momma ” ) and Mr. Schieffer ( “ a far , far left-wing Democrat and dinosaur ” ) . They called Ms. Raddatz and Mr. Lehrer “ far , far left ” as well . More surprising was the reaction at PBS 's NewsHour , Mr. Lehrer 's home for more than 35 years until their retirement last year . The morning editorial meeting was under way on Monday when The Drudge Report revealed the names of the four moderators . Gwen Ifill and Judy Woodruff , the leaders of the program 's political coverage , were stunned to see the names .
In the suddenly gloomy meeting , some wondered if the list was legitimate . Others murmured that the selection of Mr. Lehrer was a setback for the “ NewsHour , ” which has been trying to show off younger stars like Ms. Ifill . Ms. Ifill , in particular , was livid , according to several people present . “ I was indeed disappointed , ” they confirmed Friday .
( Reuters ) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc ( WMT.N ) on Tuesday joined the list of U.S. retailers reporting disappointing quarterly results , saying consumers ' pocketing tax refunds and savings from cheaper gasoline had dented its sales growth .
Shares of the world 's largest retailer tumbled 4.3 percent after it reported sales and earnings below analysts ' estimates . Its profit outlook for the current quarter was largely below expectations .
The results illustrate the obstacles facing Chief Executive Officer Doug McMillon , who took the job 15 months ago . The company is hoping a $ 1 billion investment in workers ' pay and training will lead to more engaged employees and stronger sales at its roughly 4,500 U.S. stores .
Wal-Mart said sales at stores open more than a year increased 1.1 percent in the 13 weeks ended on May 1 from a year earlier . Analysts polled by research firm Consensus Metrix had expected a 1.5 percent rise .
The tepid growth underscores sluggish spending across the sector . U.S. retail sales have been flat or lower industrywide in four of the last five months , and results from department store chains Kohls Corp ( KSS.N ) and Macys Inc ( M.N ) also disappointed investors last week .
“ Many of our U.S. customers are using their tax refunds and the extra money from lower gas prices to pay down debt or put it into savings , ” McMillon said on a prerecorded earnings call , citing recent surveys .
Wal-Mart said it drew more customer visits in the United States for the second straight quarter and that comparable sales at its smaller-format stores rose 7.9 percent .
But sales of groceries , which account for more than half of the company 's total , were flat , Chief Financial Officer Charles Holley said on a call with reporters .
Edward Jones analyst Brian Yarbrough said Wal-Mart might be losing market share to dollar stores and grocery chains like Kroger Co ( KR.N ) , which is projecting 3 percent to 4 percent same-store sales growth this year .
“ Wal-Mart is in a tough position on the grocery side because there is no longer this huge price gap between them and conventional grocery store chains , ” Yarbrough said .
Consumer electronics sales declined , partly because port disruptions on the West Coast delayed TV shipments , Holley said .
Earnings and sales at Wal-Mart 's Sam 's Club , which sells items in bulk and charges a membership fee , also fell in the quarter . The unit 's larger rival , Costco Wholesale Corp ( COST.O ) , is faring much better , Yarbrough said .

Wal-Mart 's net profit fell to $ 3.34 billion , or $ 1.03 per share , in the first quarter ended April 30 from $ 3.59 billion , or $ 1.11 per share , a year earlier . Analysts on average had expected $ 1.04 per share , according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S .
Revenue dipped to $ 114.83 billion from $ 114.96 billion . That reflected a hit of about $ 3.3 billion from the stronger U.S. dollar , which reduces the value of overseas sales .
For the second quarter , Wal-Mart forecast earnings of $ 1.06 to $ 1.18 per share , versus the analysts ' average estimate of $ 1.17 . It expects the firmer dollar and the increase in workers ' pay to hurt results by 8 cents .
Sometimes our projects fail . How we , as a team , and our managers and leaders deal with it is very , very important . We can learn from what happened , we can try to figure out what went wrong , what needs to be improved in future projects . It also decides how team will feel and how they will approach future endeavours .
This post is inspired by story of one of my fellow devs . They recently finished a short project for a client . When they were starting few weeks ago , no one was willing to work on this project as everyone thought deadlines are impossible to meet . Requirements were complex , team was not too familiar with the domain etc . And here comes manager , not technical guy , spending their time convincing the team that this is easy , doable , they can achieve it . Complex requirements are not that complicated and everything can be simplified . In the end , one dev said that yea , they can do it . They started working on the project .
Soon , of course , developer realised that this is at least as complex as everyon initially thought , starting putting in more and more hours into project , working 12 hours a day . Others on the team started staying long hours to help collegue .
When final date was close , manager came in , said that everything is cool and they can leave at 4pm , not to worry about anything . And some of the team did . Others decided to stay late and finish up the project .
On Monday there was demo for client . Demo apparently went well , client was happy , however product was mostly smoke and mirros , not fully implemted . It happens , right ? Underestimated complexity , short deadline , team with not deep enough knowledge and no domain expert available . But – they pushed , they delivered something so it is not all down the drain . Or so I thought listening to the story .
Next day , manager came in , shouting at everyone , taking away bonuses from people that left on time on Friday ( that is , after 8 hours of work ) . They blamed the whole team for the failure , not taking the blame on himself . This is ugly , I think . Team initially did not want to commit to the project as they thought it was not feasible to deliver it in given time frame . Team warned manager . And they only started work after manager worked hard to convince them that they are wrong and project is easy . Team did not deserve this kind of treatment after finished project , despite its potential failure ( client was happy , I remind you , even if not over the moon – at least content ) . Taking away bonuses , screaming at people only because they left on time , exactly like manager told them too . And not taking into account that they spent a lot of time working overtime trying to deliver the project – that 's ugly , ugly managing of people . Definite red flag if you ask me .
But that was not the end . What came next strikes me as pure sociopathy . Manager told the team , that they need to pick one person who 's most responsible for project 's problems and this person will get fired . Yea , you got that right . Team has to pick someone who will loose their job . Like it 's some kind of big brother or shit .
Is n't it crazy ? I mean – is n't that , at the very least , manager 's job to manage people and decide who to fire ( although in given situation I do n't think anyone , except for maybe manager , deserves to get the boot ) ? How toxic is the situation with the team now is hard for me to imagine . What will happen when next project will have problems ( which eventually will happen ) . Who will get fired then ? Should I bring pizza for everyone next Friday so they will feel bad if I make any mistake and will not fire me ?
This manager decided that people on the team are their resources . Cows , giving milk . And if one cow seems to not give enough milk this week , not only will they turn this cow into hamburgers , but they will make other cows look .
This is not how managing people works . This is not how anything should work , not in development teams , not in any other kind of work . Seems like this , so called , manager is not only completely untrained to do their job , they are also basically evil and unfit for any kind of people-contact position .
What they thought they are , is the king , allmighty .
What they should have thought about themselves is being a good leader , showing the way and solving problems , not creating ones .
Tom Anselmi wants to get a few things off their chest . First of all , the chief operating officer of Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment is “ pissed off ” about the poor performance of Toronto FC this season , which will see the team miss the playoffs for the fourth straight year . They also admit the club “ screwed up royally ” with its season-ticket renewals .
Maple Leaf Sports and Entertainment executive Tom Anselmi says Toronto FC will reach out to fans with town hall-style meetings and scale back season ticket packages after missing playoffs for the fourth year of its existence . ( STEVE RUSSELL / TORONTO STAR )
And they vow to “ get this fixed real quick ” by re-jigging season ticket packages and hiring the right general manager to improve on-field results . “ We do n't feel good about the fact that we are where we are because the objective this year was the playoffs and we missed it , ” Anselmi said in an interview Tuesday . “ It 's bothering me . “ I feel a personal obligation to our fans to deliver and so far we have n't . ”

TFC , which has been a box-office sensation since it joined Major League Soccer as an expansion team in 2007 , was officially eliminated from the playoff race last Saturday just prior to a 3-0 loss to Chivas USA . With two games to go , the Reds ( 8-13-7 ) sit in 11th place among 16 teams . In a wide-ranging conversation just three days before the deadline for 2011 season-ticket renewals , Anselmi made a plea for fans to “ hang in there. ” Scarf-waving supporters , angry with the lack of improvement on the field and dramatic increases of over 30 per cent in cost and four more games in their season-ticket packages for next season , have been voicing their displeasure with chants and protests during home games . TFC is to announce Wednesday that Anselmi is going to hold a series of town-hall meetings with supporter groups . The club is also removing a pair of CONCACAF Champions League matches from obligatory purchase in season tickets , a move that will cut the total cost of the 2011 package , they said .
“ We screwed up and we 're going to apologize , ” Anselmi said of the move . “ Our job is real simple now , ” they said . “ It 's to deliver them a product they can be proud of , give them something to cheer about .

“ We 're going to turn it around. ” Diehard TFC supporters , who made TFC the model for MLS expansion by packing the stadium for every game , are excused for believing they 've seen this movie before . The last time , was about 50 weeks ago , not long after the Reds got thumped 5-0 by the then-last place New York Red Bulls in the season 's final game to come up one point short in their post-season bid . The hiring of Preki Radosavljevic , who replaced interim head coach Chris Cummins , was trumpeted by general manager Mo Johnston and Anselmi as a key piece of the puzzle to getting TFC its first playoff appearance . Instead , both Preki and Johnston , former teammates , have been fired and the search is on for a new general manager , who may also herald big changes . While Anselmi was reluctant to spend much time reviewing 2010 publicly , they did say the “ disconnected situation ” between the two men meant the plan for 2010 to make “ a couple of tweaks that would put us over the finish line ” and into the playoffs was abandoned for wholesale roster moves . “ The bottom line is you make a plan but then you ignore it and rip the guts of the team apart and change 15 people , all bets are off , ” Anselmi said of the massive player overhaul undertaken by Preki and Johnston . “ At Maple Leaf Sports , we 've been accused at length about suits like me interfering with the team . ( This is ) proof positive , we do n't interfere . “ We had a general manager and a head coach who played together on both sides of the ocean , won a championship together . You would have thought that they were on the same page . We stayed out of their hair and let them do what they did and maybe that was n't the right thing. ” Anselmi insisted that they and other MLSE executives are n't looking to run the day-to-day operations of the team . But rather than a “ one-man band ” as under Johnston , they said the new GM will have soccer people around them in the front office , including interim GM Earl Cochrane and Jim Brennan , who earlier this season retired to move to the front office as Johnston 's assistant . “ We think we 've let them down , ” Anselmi said of TFC fans . “ We 're sorry . ”
The 51st Super Bowl will be in Houston in February and they Half-Time show will have to be huge . A report from The Sun in the UK says that superstar singer Adele is being tapped by the NFL to be the performer for the biggest television event of the year .
According to The Sun 's NFL source , “ There is nobody bigger in the world than Adele right now and organizers are doing absolutely everything they can to try to persuade them to sign up . She 's sold out every date on their tour , everyone wants a piece of them and they know they can bank on them bringing in the viewers . ”
Coldplay , Beyonce & Bruno Mars took the stage at Super Bowl 50 in San Francisco and performed their hit songs to 115 million Americans watching at home .
It is unlikely that Adele would perform alone , as most of the recent halftime shows are collaborations of many different artists . One Republic and Adele friend Ryan Tedder could join the Pop star on stage at NRG Stadium .
NEWMAN — Rumors drifted across the parched Central Valley that a bidding war for water might push auction prices as high as $ 3,000 an acre-foot , up from $ 60 in a normal year .
Yet , Ray Flanders needed water to keep their orchards alive . So this spring they sealed their bid in an envelope , climbed into their truck and drove 70 miles to hand-deliver it to the Madera Irrigation District , which had water saved from 2013 .
And they waited , along with 71 neighboring drought-damaged farmers , to learn their fate in a year that has made water a precious crop for those whose supplies have been cut off and the lucky few who have some to spare .
“ If I did n't buy that water , we 'd have 800 acres of dead trees , ” said Flanders , who manages the generations-old Nunes Farms outside Modesto .
One of the worst droughts in state history is pushing water prices to record levels — fraying nerves , eroding bank accounts and stress-testing the state 's “ water market , ” an informal and largely hidden network of buyers and sellers .
Water is essential to life . But it 's also a commodity , like oil or gold , and its prices swing in response to supply and demand , geography and decisions out of Sacramento .
Market-driven “ water trading ” is helpful in a drought , say experts , because it is an agile way to move water from the haves to have-nots , and from lower-value to high-value uses . For those with water , it may be more profitable to sell it than grow crops ; in fact , it may be their only way of paying their bills .
“ The market helps California 's overall water use become more economically efficient … People are looking for creative ways to meet their needs , ” said Ellen Hanak , a water policy expert at the Public Policy Institute of California . It also spurs conservation , they said : As water prices rise , demand will fall .
But the contentious water market can pit neighbor against neighbor , favoring those with the oldest rights to water , the most underground water or the deepest pockets .
The suddenly volatile water market is spurring new trends :
Pumping groundwater for profit . Stanislaus County farmers want to pay Merced farmers Steve Sloan and Stephen Smith $ 1,000 per acre-foot for their well water . The $ 11.5 million to $ 14 million offer has divided the agricultural community . Some fear that selling groundwater will accelerate depletion of the wells all depend on ; others say the pumping , which will be monitored , is essential to their survival .
Big Ag 's deep pockets driving up prices . Harris Ranch Beef Co. , one of the nation 's largest family-owned agribusinesses , paid $ 1,350 an acre-foot at auction for Kern River water from the Buena Vista Water Storage District , near Bakersfield . Paramount Farming bought a stunning $ 11 million worth of water at the same auction .
Rice farm water for Silicon Valley . Santa Clara Valley Water District paid $ 582 to $ 862 per acre-foot to “ North of Delta ” contractors , such as rice farmers in Glenn and Colusa counties who had too little water for their crop but enough to sell .
Price swings . The East Bay Municipal Utility District paid $ 75 an acre-foot for Placer County Water Authority surplus water from the American River . Only months later , the Placer agency sold water to the San Joaquin Valley 's Westlands Water District for $ 325 — more than four times the East Bay rate . The East Bay benefitted from a long-term contract , lower delivery cost and shared regulatory expenses .
Amid the bidding wars , some farmers choose to help others . San Joaquin Valley east-side growers , who have San Joaquin River water rights that date back to the 1800s , this month sold water for $ 250 an acre-foot , only $ 25 above cost , to growers on the east side to help fellow farmers , they said .
The water market is “ a survival thing , but not sustainable , ” said Jim Jasper of Stewart & Jasper Orchards , near Modesto , who bid $ 1,750 an acre-foot for the Madera water to supplement their farm 's fragile groundwater supplies . They and Flanders , a friend and neighbor , submitted competing bids .
Due to lack of water , Jasper had already decided to leave trees on 360 of their 2,000 acres to die . “ We were hoping to get something , but had no idea , ” they said .
Such “ traded water ” represents a relatively small part of all water used by Californians , but it has grown significantly over the past three decades . ( Most water is bought and delivered under long-term contracts through an intricate network of state and federal aqueducts . ) Annual trades in the early 1980s averaged just over 100,000 acre-feet . By 2011 , the annual volume of water sold was 1.3 million acre-feet . One acre-foot is about 326,000 gallons , or a 12- to 18-month supply for an average California family .
Much of the new need has come from cities , which represent 40 percent of market demand , with more than three times as many purchases in 2011 than in the 1990s , according to Hanak 's analysis . Typically , cities buy rural water through long-term contracts to support development , not just to get through a drought .
This year 's continuing severe drought has triggered the statewide rush to secure water , wherever it can be found .
Last year , Flanders paid $ 275 an acre-foot ; by January , the cost was $ 510 . Bids at the February auction started at $ 750 .
“ It 's supply and demand — and there 's very short supply , ” said Ara Azhderian , of the San Luis & Delta Mendota Water Authority . “ In years where water is abundant , like 2011 , it is the buyers who drive the market more . But in years like this , the sellers drive the market . ”
Particularly desperate are growers who depend entirely on government water delivered through the canals and aqueducts that turned California 's deserts into lush farmland . The state has allocated only 5 percent of what users requested ; the federal government released nothing .
“ We live and die off our ability to bring water in , ” said Jeff Cattaneo of San Benito County Water District , which was part of a negotiation that paid rice farmers $ 500 an acre-foot , up from the usual $ 170 .
Sellers say such prices help farmers survive by selling water they ca n't use . It 's like subletting your rental office ; you lose business , but you 're getting paid for the space .
The state regulates the market 's environmental impacts — usually , after a deal has been negotiated . In May , Gov . Jerry Brown issued an executive order to streamline approvals for water transfers .
“ It is a very haphazard , very fragmented system , ” said UC Davis water economist Richard Howitt . “ This is very little information about what is going on , and what the prices are . It is completely nontransparent . ”
Unlike the electric power grid , they said , there 's no Independent System Operator that matches buyers and sellers , preapproves transactions and aids negotiations to prevent water 's equivalent of power “ brownouts . ”
“ It 's old school , driven on relationships , ” said Azhderian . “ Farmer to farmer . Irrigation manager to irrigation manager . In coffee shops or over the phone . Someone might call and say , ‘ Hey , I 've got this need . How are you doing over there ? ' ”
On the fateful Monday when Madera 's auction results were announced , Jasper learned their $ 1,750 bid was too low to qualify . They have a backup plan : He 'll use more of their existing supply , and he 's bidding to buy elsewhere . For Flanders , the auction news was welcome . Their bid — one of 12 winning ones between $ 2,000 and $ 2,200 per acre-foot — was accepted .
There will be no profit this year , but the farm will survive .
“ It was a relief , ” they said . “ We got the water . We have a chance to produce a crop . ”

Senator Malcolm Roberts during a recent press conference , attacking CSIRO . Credit : Andrew Meares `` We are certainly gratified by the attention Australia pays to our analysis , but in case you have remaining questions , I urge you to perform your own analyses . '' The claim that NASA tampered with decades-old Arctic data is a favourite conspiracy theory among global warming sceptics who argue the current run-up in temperatures – especially at the North Pole – is nothing exceptional , and so action to address climate change is unnecessary . In their letter to NASA dated November 14 , Senator Roberts explained their interest in the agency 's temperature calculations , saying they had `` influenced '' the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 's warnings on global warming that in turn had informed Australian government policy . Senator Roberts , a former coalmining manager , rejects the idea climate change is related to carbon-dioxide levels and last week attacked the CSIRO 's climate science .
Fairfax Media has sought comment from Senator Roberts . On Twitter , they said they `` had not had a chance to reply as the email only arrived Saturday '' . Iceland weighs in `` In Australia , we have considerable concern about temperature adjustments made by NASA over many years , '' Senator Roberts wrote , including charts from Icelandic stations at Vestmannaeyjar and Teigarhorn . `` In dropping the temperatures for the early period , the [ Arctic ] warmth for the 1930s and 1940s appears to have been removed , '' they said . `` What is your specific reason for doing this ? ''
I 'm aware of who Malcolm Roberts is , and the only surprise is that they are in fact a senator Gavin Schmidt , NASA GISS director In an email , Truasti Jonsoon , senior meteorologist with a specialty in historical climatology at the Icelandic Meteorological Office , told Senator Roberts that the temperature `` adjustments '' are `` quite sound '' . The original data was not from NASA but the Smithsonian publication `` World weather records '' , they said . `` During this early period there was a large daytime bias in the temperature data from Iceland as presented in this publication , '' which accounted for much of the `` discrepancy '' at Teigarhorn and less so at Vestmannaeyjar , Mr Jonsoon said . For the latter station , it was relocated in October 1921 to a higher elevation . `` Comparative measurements at both sites have shown that the later location is about 0.7 degrees Celsius colder than the former – this relocation has to be 'adjusted ' for , '' they said .
`` I assure you that these adjustments are absolutely necessary and well founded although the finer details of the resulting series shown in your letter differ slightly from my own version , '' they told Senator Roberts .
Dr Schmidt said the Arctic was `` not so much '' the target of data critics . `` But the insistence that the data must 've been inappropriately adjusted [ is what the sceptics say ] all the time , '' they told Fairfax Media . `` [ It 's ] pretty much the definition of denial . '' Loading Dr Schmidt said they were not surprised that the query about Arctic temperatures was coming from Australia . `` I 'm aware of who Malcolm Roberts is , and the only surprise is that they are in fact a senator , '' they said .

In 1741 , the Russian Second Kamchatka Expedition under the leadership of explorer Vitus Bering extended Russian sovereignty over northwestern North America . The Russians were interested in enlarging the lucrative fur trade . Officially , the purpose of the expedition was to determine if Asia and the Americas are joined .
The Russians encountered the Tlingit in Alaska and lost two boats , each with ten men . According to oral tradition , the Tlingit lured the unsuspecting crew members with a bear skin and killed them .
Unfortunately , the Russians also found sea otter which was valuable in the Chinese market . This led to the development of the Russian fur trade in the area .
In 1788 , a Russian expedition made contact with the Tlingit under the leadership of Ilchak from the Chilcat River . The Russians gave Ilchak a Russian crest in copper and a picture of the heir to the Russian throne .
In 1793 , a group of Russians and Aleut under the leadership of Baron Baranof were attacked by the Tlingit . The Tlingit were wearing armor made of wooden rods bound together with leather thongs . Their faces were protected by masks which represented different animals and gave a frightening appearance . They were wearing wooden hats . The Tlingit fought with lances , bows , and pointed daggers . While the Russians aimed their guns at their attackers ' heads , they soon found that their bullets did not penetrate the thick head coverings . Still , with the superiority of fire power , the Russians were victorious and the Tlingit fled leaving 12 dead behind . Two Russians and nine Aleuts were killed and 15 others in the Russian party were wounded .
Three years later , Baron Baranof established a Russian colony with 80 colonists in Yukatat Bay . Many of the Tlingit chiefs made ceremonial visits to Baranof . They showed their friendliness toward the Russians by leaving some of their own children and relatives to live among the Russian colonists .
In 1799 , the Russians under the leadership of Alexander Baranov established a trading post at New Archangel ( now called Sitka ) in Tlingit territory . The Russians relied on the Natives to supply them with food supplies . This stimulated the Tlingit around Sitka to raise tons of potatoes and bring in quantities of ‘ mutton ' ( mountain sheep meat ) and halibut .
The Russian-American Company ( RAC ) was formed in 1799 as a quasi-governmental monopoly to control the fur trade and rule the Russian colony in Alaska . RAC was given the power to establish settlements in Alaska . They were to carry on agriculture and commerce , to spread the Greek faith , and to extend Russian territory . There were usually fewer than 500 Russians in Alaska at any one given time . Most of them lived in Sitka . With regard to the Native American populations , the Russians were ruthless and moved villages to different areas where they needed people to work .
The peace between the Tlingit and the Russians did not last very long . In 1802 , the Tlingit rebelled against the Russians at the settlement of New Archangel . An estimated 600 warriors armed with guns destroyed the fort , killing 20 Russians and 130 Aleuts . Following their victory on Baranov Island , the Tlingit next attacked an Aleut hunting party quartered at Yakutat Bay . The Tlingit accused the Russian commander of robbing them of their fur-bearing animals and also of stealing skins from Tlingit graves .
Two years later , the Russians returned to Baranov Island . They reasserted their dominance over the Tlingit by sending four ships to Sitka harbor . The Russians destroyed two Indian villages . At the site of New Archangel ( Novo-Arkangelsk ) , the Russians attacked a Tlingit fort . While an initial attack was repelled , the Russians fired their ships ' canons at the fort and soon the Tlingit asked for peace . Following their defeat , the Tlingit moved to the other side of the Island .
This was not the end of the conflicts between the Russians and the Tlingit . The next year the Tlingit attacked and destroyed the Russian fort at Yakatat , Alaska .
In 1806 , the Tlingit began to plan an attack against the Russians at New Archangel . While nearly 2,000 warriors gathered for the attack , the Russian commander learned of the plans and invited the important chiefs to the fort . The Russians welcomed the chiefs with great honor , provided them with a great feast , and gave them many presents . As a result of this , the chiefs declared the Russians to be their friends and the war was averted .
In 1822 , the charter for the Russian-American Company now permitted the Russians to conscript half of the adult male population between 18 and 50 years of age to work for up to three years hunting sea otters . This undermined the natives ' ability to obtain food for themselves .
In 1836 , smallpox struck New Archangel and killed about half of the Tlingit . On the other hand , the Russians who had been vaccinated against smallpox lost only one man . This epidemic weakened the power of the traditional shamans and convinced many of the Tlingit of the superiority of Russian knowledge . As a result of the epidemic , the two groups became closer .
In 1841 , the Russian administrator of New Archangel invited the Tlingit to a fair which had a ceremonial feast for the guests . About 500 of the most prominent Tlingit gathered at a special building for the event . The Russians hoped to promote friendly relations with the tribes through the ceremonial feast .
The Russian involvement with the Tlingit ended in 1867 when Alaska was sold to the United States . The Russians had never attempted to force the Alaska natives to recognize Russian ownership , nor had they made any treaties with the natives , nor had they purchased any land from the natives . The Russians had never had any effective control over the natives and the total Russian population in Alaska was less than 800 living in four very heavily fortified towns . Thus the Russians really sold only their tenuous title to Alaska . In the transaction , the natives were barely mentioned and there was more concern for the protection of those Russians who might want to remain .
The Tlingit watched the ceremonial transfer from Russia to the United States at New Archangel ( Sitka ) with great interest . Since the Tlingit were not allowed in town , they viewed the proceedings from their canoes which were positioned in the harbor .
NYCHA starts $ 88 million recovery project at Astoria Houses
NYCHA 's Michele Moore explains the scope of the $ 88 million project at Astoria Houses . slideshow

The New York City Housing Authority ( NYCHA ) has begun work to rebuild and improve developments at Astoria Houses that were badly damaged by Superstorm Sandy.Thanks to an historic $ 3 billion grant from the Federal Emergency Management Agency ( FEMA ) , the Astoria Houses is undergoing an $ 88 million project to replace roofs , install backup generators , and add new flood-protected electrical systems.New security cameras and lighting are also part of the project. “ We took a long time to finalize negotiations with FEMA , but in the end , we fought for every dollar that we could and were able to secure the largest grant in FEMA history , ” said Michele Moore , NYCHA 's acting director in the Capital Projects Division . “ At the same time , we 're taking some of the burden off NYCHA by doing crucial repairs that we would not have had the funding for otherwise. ” The $ 3 billion grant is going toward repairing 33 public housing developments through Brooklyn , Queens and Manhattan . The Astoria Houses is the third complex to begin construction , behind a $ 67 million project in the Rockaways and a $ 41 million project in Coney Island.According to Moore , eight buildings in Astoria Houses near the East River were severely impacted by Superstorm Sandy . Between 18 and 22 inches of flood water crept into the ground floors of the buildings.Many residents suffered a loss of electricity that also knocked out elevators.Two playgrounds close to the water were also damaged by Sandy and will be repaired . Moore said the agency is starting the design process for the playgrounds now , and will meet with the community for input. “ We will work with residents to see what kind of play equipment they want to see , ” they said.Moore said NYCHA hired Long Island City-based Navillus Contracting to repair the units in Astoria Houses.They 're working on kitchen and bathroom repairs , repainting walls and other renovations . It takes between five and six weeks to repair one apartment.According to NYCHA , more than 120 public housing residents have been employed by the contractors , including 51 NYCHA residents from Queens . At Astoria Houses , the contractor Navillus has committed to hiring 10 employees from the local neighborhood. “ We have local NYCHA residents working on Sandy recovery projects , ” Moore said . “ I think that 's crucial because these are the residents that had to live through Sandy and now they can better themselves through the recovery. ” The timeline for the improvements is anywhere from two to two-and-a-half years , Moore said , depending on the weather. “ We 're going to stick to our timeline , but we have to make sure the work is done properly with a focus on safety , ” they said.Councilman Costa Constantinides toured the damaged apartments with NYCHA residents and staff last week. “ This will all go a long way to making sure that , if God forbid something like this happens again , the residents will be better protected , ” they said . “ This $ 88 million is going to go a long way to bring these buildings to resiliency standards in the 21st century. ” Marion Pearson , an Astoria Houses resident since 1987 , said they were sitting in their apartment the day that Superstorm Sandy struck . They said it was both scary and exciting.Pearson lives on the second floor of a building right on the waterfront . They looked out their kitchen window and saw all of the rain and water heading toward her. “ I came out of my building to look and see how bad it was , and the water was to here in the lobby area , ” they said , pointing to their knees . “ I came outside in front of my building . The pressure of the water pushed me back a little bit , so I said , ‘ it 's time to go back inside . ' “ I spent the rest of the day watching everyone else out the windows , watching the cars go under the water , ” they added . “ I stayed safe in my apartment. ” Pearson said they were one of the lucky residents who did n't lose power , electricity or gas . But many of their neighbors did.The longtime resident said the National Guard eventually came and provided water , food and toiletries , but many residents were fed up with how long it took restore power . They had to rely on the help of friends , family and other community members. “ They were feeling neglected and a little upset and angry , ” Pearson said.Pearson is now working with NYCHA to ensure that the community 's voice is heard in the improvement project . They said she 's grateful to live in a safe and tight-knit community. “ For me , living in this community , even though it 's public housing , it 's a blessing , ” they said . “ If you look at the size of the apartments , the open space , the kids that come out , you feel safe . ”

Clone High 's quest to skewer every teen show stereotype means it was only a matter of time before it got to the student election . It 's hard to blame high school shows for embracing this trope . Student elections can be a nifty microcosm of the high school popularity conundrum . Yes , there are some hardworking high school kids who actually want to do some good in their schools , but for the most part , student elections are dominated by popular kids who like having their popularity quantified . Winning an election makes their higher status official .
Advertisement
With this in mind , Clone High sets up its obvious rivals for the student body president race : the ever-insecure Abe Lincoln versus the always cocky JFK . The fact that both these boys come from the genetic material of former United States Presidents immediately heightens this tired storyline . Still , neither boy decides to run on their own . Instead , “ Episode Two : Election Blu Galoo ” makes the smart choice to keep Abe and JFK 's goal simple and relatable to actual teens : they just want to get laid . In fact , neither boy actually gives a single shit about the nebulous issues they 're supposed to be addressing . It 's the most realistic student election I 've ever seen on television , even when a monster truck crushes a genetic duplicate of our sixteenth president as they attempt to windsurf a half-pipe ( “ which the original Abraham Lincoln would have done , had they had the tools to do so ” ) .
Now , this episode is ostensibly about candidates Abe and JFK , but it really belongs to Cleo and Joan . While Cleo was just a placeholder for a generic high school sexpot in the pilot , she 's a full-blown Lady Macbeth in this episode . More accurately , Cleo acts much closer to the traditional picture of their genetic predecessor . They seduce JFK into running because their own term is up , and they need a replacement that will abdicate the position so they can circumvent the term limit and rule the school once again . If that shaky sentence structure did n't tip you off , it 's an incredibly complex motivation , even if the episode does n't spend much time with it . Joan defecting to JFK 's campaign is less interesting—ninety percent of Joan 's storylines can be traced back to their crush on Abe—but it still results in the best gag of the episode . Them vicious attack ad on Abe is a sharp take on political smear tactics and manipulative wordplay : “ [ Abe ] would also like you to believe he 's not a baby-eater . He 's never gone on record saying they are n't . Maybe he 's too busy eating babies . ”
The other side of “ Election Blu Galoo ” is a takedown of product placement and hyperactive energy drink advertising , both of which had their heydays in the aughts . Despite Tasmanian Devil levels of energy from Scrubs alums ( recurring voices Zac Braff , Sarah Chalke , and Donald Faison ) , Red Bull doppelganger “ Extreme Blu ” is the least effective part of the episode . Part of this could be the inevitable drawback of reviewing a show in retrospect . At this point , the product placement parody is well-trod territory . In fact , Josie And The Pussycats came out just a year before Clone High went into production , and I 'm not sure mocking product placement ever did better than that wall-to-wall satire of over seventy brands ( though 30 Rock also made a good effort ) . So despite blu-haired Abe , the most fun aspect of Extreme Blu taking over Clone High is what it does to Scudworth . I have n't talked about Vice Principal Dr. Cinnamon J. Scudworth much yet , because the conspiracy behind Clone High was never as compelling to me as the actual clones . Still , Scudworth and Butlertron are a delightfully unhinged pairing that are often best as accents to the storylines at hand , like they are in “ Election Blu Galoo ” ( though an exception occurs in the very next episode , so more on that later ) . But when I think of “ Election Blu Galoo , ” I never remember the hyper-drama of product placement . I remember Abe and Joan bickering from their parallel “ thinking docks ” and Marilyn Manson 's twisted take on the food pyramid . The clones might be the hook for the series , but the banality of high school is still Clone High 's best joke well .

Recently , professional sports associations and teams have made big strides towards leveraging data to inform both personel and on-the-field decision making . While the four major leagues ( NBA , NFL , MLB , NHL ) vary in terms of where they are in that process , most people would argue that the NBA is at the forefront of this movement . If you have never heard of SportVu before , they are a company that has partnered with the NBA to “ utilize a six-camera system installed in basketball arenas to track the real-time positions of players and the ball 25 times per second . Utilizing this tracking data , SportVu is able to create a wealth of innovative statistics based on speed , distance , player separation and ball possession. ” As stated , the release of aggregated SportsVu data has offered brand-new insights into how the game of basketball is played , and more importantly , how each individual plays the game .
In this post , I looked at the SportVu data available for all NBA players active during the 2014-2015 season . More particularly , I was interested in finding out whether SportVu data could be leveraged to discover players with similar playing styles , but also to discover teams with similar rosters . To begin , I started off by writing a quick Python script to scrape SportsVu data from http : //www.stats.com/sportvu/sportvu-basketball-media/
Collections and scraping the data

DataFrame ( table ) df . columns = headers df = df . set_index ( [ 'PLAYER_ID ' , 'TEAM_ABBREVIATION ' ] ) df . columns = [ ' { } _ { } ' . format ( key , x ) for x in df . columns ] sportsvu_data [ key ] = df
# concatenate all sportsvu data sportvu = None for suffix , input_df in sportsvu_data . items ( ) : print suffix if sportvu is None : sportvu = input_df else : sportvu = pd . merge ( sportvu , input_df , how = 'inner ' , left_index = True , right_index = True )
# filter out dataframe to players who have had relevant playing time df = sportvu df = df [ df . pullup_address_GP > = 41 ] df = df [ df . pullup_address_MIN > = 15 ] # set index of final dataframe df_final = df . T . drop_duplicates ( ) . T . reset_index ( ) df_final = df_final . set_index ( [ 'PLAYER_ID ' , 'TEAM_ABBREVIATION ' , 'pullup_address_PLAYER ' ] ) # remove those columns because they are redundant cols_to_remove = [ 'pullup_address_FIRST_NAME ' , 'pullup_address_LAST_NAME ' , 'pullup_address_GP ' , 'pullup_address_MIN ' ] df_final . drop ( cols_to_remove , axis = 1 , inplace = True ) # remove duplicate columns df_final = df . T . drop_duplicates ( ) . T
There is nothing extraordinary in the code above , I essentially scraped some data from publicly ( I hope ) available data , and after a small clean-up , concatenated all the data into a single Pandas dataframe . The only thing of note is that I restricted the data collection to players who averaged at least 15 minutes per game and played in at least half the games in the season . In total , this leaves us with 329 NBA players , each with 80 unique Sportvu data points .
Inferring and visualizing similarities between NBA players
With the data now in our hands ( or RAM ) , we can proceed to the original intent of this blog post , which is finding players with the most similar playing styles . After some trial and error , I obtained the best results when computing the correlation matrix between Sportvu metrics for all players , and then applying the t-SNE dimensionality reduction algorithm . Roughly , t-SNE is considered to be useful because of its property to conserve the overall topology of the data , so that neighboring ( i.e . similar ) players are mapped to neighboring locations in a two-dimensional space ( It is this property that makes it so amenable to image analysis ) . Other well-known clustering techniques such as k-means or MDS would also be adequate for this exercise , but I 've had good fortune when using t-SNE , so am perhaps unwisely sticking to it here .
# compute the correlation matrix between SportsVu metrics for all NBA players # note : Pearson or Spearman showed little differences in results df_final = df_final . convert_objects ( convert_numeric = True ) df_final = df_final . astype ( float ) corr = df_final . T . corr ( ) X = corr . as_matrix ( )
# perform t-SNE dimensionality reduction and print to file X_reduced = TruncatedSVD ( n_components = 10 , random_state = 0 ) . fit_transform ( X ) tsne = manifold . TSNE ( n_components = 2 , perplexity = 40 , verbose = 2 ) X_tsne = tsne . fit_transform ( X_reduced ) df = pd . DataFrame ( X_tsne ) df [ 'player ' ] = [ x [ 2 ] for x in df_final . index ] df [ 'team ' ] = [ x [ 1 ] for x in df_final . index ] df . columns = [ ' x ' , ' y ' , 'player ' , 'team ' ] df . to_csv ( 'tsne_clusters.csv ' , index = False )
The advantage of using t-SNE in this context is that we are effectively taking an unsupervised approach , with the hopes that we can infer natural groupings of players based on their Sportvu statistics . Now that the data has been processed , we can start to visualize it . From there on , I will proceed to some nasty context switching and use R ( I love both R and Python but hate using both in a single projetc . However , I am justifying my decision on the fact that , despite recent progress for Python , R still currently has far better wrappers around JS/D3 ) .
# import required R libraries library ( data.table ) library ( scatterD3 ) library ( d 3 heatmap ) library ( ggplot2 ) library ( ggrepel ) library ( htmlwidgets ) # read in tsne representations dt < - fread ( 'tsne_clusters.csv ' , header = TRUE ) dt < - dt [ team ! = 'TOTAL ' ]
# Use k-means to uncover natural clusters of players # Compute sum of squares for different values of k wss < - c ( ) for ( i in 1 : 15 ) { wss < - c ( wss , sum ( kmeans ( dt [ , list ( x , y ) ] , centers = i ) $ withinss ) ) } # plot sum of squares as a function of cluster count in order # to find the `` elbow '' . Optimal cluster count was found to be 7 plot ( 1 : 15 , wss , type = `` b '' , xlab = `` Number of Clusters '' , ylab = `` Within groups sum of squares '' ) # add cluster assigments to data.table object cl < - kmeans ( dt [ , list ( x , y ) ] , centers = 7 ) positions < - c ( 'Shooting Guard ' , 'Dynamic C/PF ' , 'Slow C/PF ' , 'Dynamic SF/PF ' , 'Slow SF/PF ' , 'Point Guard ' , 'Stretch C/PF ' ) dt [ , 'cluster ' : = cl $ cluster ] dt [ , 'position ' : = positions [ dt $ cluster ] ]
# plot and save interactive D3 scatter plot tooltips < - paste ( `` < strong > '' , dt $ player , `` < /strong > < br / > < strong > '' , dt $ team , `` < /strong > < br / > '' ) p < - scatterD3 ( x = dt $ x , y = dt $ y , lab = dt $ player , col_var = dt $ team , symbol_var = dt $ position , point_opacity = 0.7 , tooltip_text = tooltips , col_lab = `` Team '' , symbol_lab = `` Position Group '' , width = 1000 , height = 1000 ) saveWidget ( p , file = 'nba_player_similarity.html ' )
The plot below shows the natural groupings of players , where the shape represents the cluster they belong to and the color represent their respective teams . Feel free to zoom , highlight certain teams or clusters ( by hovering over the legends ) and generally just playing around it .
NBA player similarity
Upon investigation , we can see that this approach makes a lot of sense . For example , players such as Damian Lillard , Mario Chalmers , Eric Bledsoe or Derick Rose are very to each other in space . There are many other examples like this ( Serge Ibaka and Lamarcus Aldridge ; Jimmy Butler and Andre Iguodola ) but it is interesting to note how the shooting and point guard have well-defined positions , whereas the Center , Power Forward and Small Forward positions show a lot more heterogeneity and complexity . There are some mis-assignments here and there but these tend to be on the boundary of clusters , which could be probably be fixed after some further optimization and tinkering of the cluster assignments .
Team roster similarity
We can also leverage the results obtained from the dimensionality reduction part to discover teams that share the most similar roster of players . Given two teams X and Y with players [ x1 , ... , xn ] and [ y1 , ... , yn ] respectively , one way of achieving this is through the following steps :
Select player from team X ( say x1 ) Compute point-to-point distance between player x1 and all players [ y1 , … , yn ] in team Y Select and record the minimum value between player x1 and all players [ y1 , … , yn ] in team Y . We are effectively finding the player in team Y that is most similar to player x1 Repeat step 1 to 3 for all remaining players in team X and sum the total point distance to get a “ distance ” value between team X and Y
By summing distances between pairs of players that are most similar in each team , we can then assume that pairs of teams with low total distance between one another have more similar rosters than pairs of teams with high total distance .
# get point-point distance between teams 'point_distance ' < - function ( p 1 , p 2 ) { dx = ( p 1 [ 1 ] - p 2 [ 1 ] ) ^ 2 dy = ( p 1 [ 2 ] - p 2 [ 2 ] ) ^ 2 return ( sqrt ( dx + dy ) ) }

It seems likely that Kevin Nolan will be playing away from Upton Park next year or play a much smaller role than they have in recent seasons . With Nolan being the current West Ham United captain , obvious questions have been asked , just who will replace them as skipper ?
It seems likely Nolan will be club captain with a new team captain appointed given that they seem to be behind the likes of Mark Noble , Stewart Downing , Cheikou Kouyate , Pedro Obiang and Morgan Amalfitano in the pecking order . It also will not be surprising to see them behind Mauro Zarate and with rumours of more midfielders coming in , it seems as though it is unlikely that Nolan will remain a regular .
Slaven Bilic will have a big decision to make in replacing one of the best captains this club has ever had , who has been pivotal to the clubs successes over the past four years . For many , the obvious choice seems to be the incumbent vice-captain Mark Noble . Noble is of course , a one club man ( what do you mean they had loan spells at Hull City and Ipswich Town ? ) , and has made more Premier League appearances for the club than any other player .
They seem full of passion whenever they play , although this can get the better of him ; back in February they were very close to getting themselves sent-off against Spurs and was taken off due to fears they would . This caused the team to lose their shape and eventually let a 2-0 lead slip to a 2-2 draw .
Yes , the midfielder has captained England at various youth levels , but in the FA Cup 3rd Round replay against Everton they were involved in an on-field spat with teammate James Tomkins and had to be dragged away by Kevin Nolan . This suggests they can sometimes be caught in the occasion , something that definitely is not a quality befitting of a captain .
Noble was also badly out of form towards the end of the season and with the signings of Pedro Obiang and Dimitri Payet and rumours of more reinforcements he , like Nolan , could have a reduced role next year .
Not including Nolan , some of West Hams the greatest captains have been defenders - notably the likes of Bobby Moore , Billy Bonds , Alvin Martin , Julian Dicks and Lucas Neil . Two obvious candidates for captaincy from the current defence are New Zealand captain Winston Reid and James Collins .
Whilst both defenders are always 100 per cent committed and capable of helping out their less experienced partners , it is questionable if either are captain material - minly because of the amount of games they miss , as both are prone to injury . Reid missed three months of the 2013/14 season and both they and Collins have suffered niggling injuries during the past year .
The presence of James Tomkins and rumours that another central defender may be coming in makes it even less certain they will play as regularly as they would like . Having said that , they could both do a job if they do indeed play regularly .
A goalkeeping solution ?
Captain elect ?
Some fans will say the captain should be the man who is currently our last line of defence , goalkeeper Adrian . Nobody could argue that Adrian does not love West Ham , however they can be a little eccentric - illustrated most notably during the home game against Liverpool when they received a yellow card for a scuffle with Mario Balotelli , when it briefly looked like they were going to try and smash the Italian forwards face in.That same day Adrian nearly got a second yellow and gave away a penalty for a foul on Fabio Borini . Whilst they escaped without punishment , their challenge was unnecessary and we could have gone down to ten men and Liverpool could have equalised with the resultant penalty.He also received a red card against Southampton , which was later rescinded , but the fact of the matter remains - they should have cleared the ball first time rather than try to skill Sadio Mane ; then it would not have been a problem.West Ham then wasted a substitution which meant Andy Carroll had to stay on the field , despite the fact they could barely walk and never featured again after that . On both of those occasions Adrian caused a problem for the team , when it couldve easily have been avoided.A stick often used to beat Kevin Nolan with is their dismissals against Millwall , Liverpool and Fulham . So surely Adrian should have their sending off/near sending offs count against him ? Make no doubt about it , they are another in a long line of excellent West Ham goalkeepers but that could count against him . Hes a goalkeeper and many would argue that the captain should be a player who can be in the thick of the action.The club seem to have an abundance of high quality midfielders . As mentioned before , Mark Noble is a well-supported candidate . Another potential candidate is Stewart Downing , but as their only previous experience as skipper was the 5-0 thrashing at Nottingham Forest and they seem to try and avoid tackles and tackling at all costs . Excellent player definitely , captain material ? Certainly not.Alex Song , who was pictured at the Boleyn Ground last Thursday night captained the club a few times during their season-long loan from Barcelona . However the main problem many have with Song is their loss of form during the latter part of the season . Whilst during the final few games they looked a lot better , they experienced what was surely the greatest dip on form that is known to man . In a matter of games they went from Trevor Brooking to Adam Nowland.Consistency is key for a captain . When the heads begin to drop a captain has to be able to give their all and drive a team on . Whilst Song can be more than capable of that , they need to prove they can do it consistently , which they didnt do last season . To sum it up , they havent shown enough to be captain material.All these possible candidates have got great qualities , but it is another midfielder who seems to tick all the boxes required to be an excellent captain . That man in Cheikhou Kouyate.Kouyate is an absolute beast of a player , they are as good as Mo Diame thinks they are . The Senegalese midfielder has been played out of position and not thrown a strop about it . They were still able to put in magnificent performances , out of position , as a central defender against Manchester United ( he played there with Collins and Reid injured ) .Downing has not been able to perform out wide and Song suffered when pushed back to protecting the back four . Kouyate has been a consistent performer and brings good performances when it matters , scoring goals in big games against Arsenal , Spurs and Man Utd . They are also a great ambassador for the club , having worked hard to get to the position where they are , and is keen to spend time with their fans.Whilst they isnt immune to injuries , Kouyate seems to be able to take a lot more knocks than most players and is able to recover a lot quicker , something which means strikers Andy Carroll and Diafra Sakho are not realistic candidates . ( You thought I was going to miss out strikers , didnt you ? ) He also seems to be the only player that was almost guaranteed to play our matches last year ( bar perhaps Adrian , Carl Jenkinson and Aaron Cresswell ) . So barring an extraordinarily-influential signing , it seems difficult to look further than Cheikou Kouyate as the next captain of West Ham United .

Maybe they were just messing with the media .
President Trump on Friday told reporters that they would announce a decision on an Obama-era immigration program “ sometime today or over the weekend , ” raising the prospect of another White House news dump . A short time later , however , White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said that Tuesday will be the day Trump makes the call on Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals , which offers two-year work permits to people who were brought to the United States illegally as children .
After threatening to bury their announcement under the hubbub of a holiday weekend , Trump has effectively put neon lights on it , instead . The public and the press will have almost a full business week to pick it apart .
The president 's initial tease came as no surprise . They have wrestled publicly with their decision and is guaranteed to spark outrage no matter what they do . They vowed as a candidate to rescind the executive action President Barack Obama signed in 2012 and would surely infuriate many supporters if they were to break their promise . They are equally certain to anger opponents by keeping their word .
There is even a third group , comprising such prominent Republicans as House Speaker Paul D. Ryan ( Wis. ) and Sen. Orrin G. Hatch ( Utah ) , that wants Trump to tear up Obama 's order , but only after Congress passes a replacement . These lawmakers ' principal objection is not to the policy but to the way Obama implemented it .
[ Paul Ryan and the conservative case for President Trump to keep DACA ]
A textbook news dump — carefully timed to avoid the full attention of the public and the press because much of the reaction will be unfavorable — would have made sense and been in keeping with White House practices .
Only a week ago , Trump dumped their pardon of former Arizona sheriff Joe Arpaio and the details of a ban on transgender military service members late on a Friday as Hurricane Harvey made landfall in Texas . On Monday , they had the gall to claim that they were trying to amplify the news , not bury it , by releasing it at a time when the country was almost singularly focused on the storm .
“ In the middle of a hurricane , even though it was a Friday evening , I assumed the ratings would be far higher than they would be normally , ” they told reporters at a joint news conference with Finland 's president .
( What would have been Trump 's excuse on DACA ? They thought TV ratings would be higher on Labor Day weekend because vacationers would be checking traffic reports ? )
Trump knows how to attract eyeballs when they want to . Think of the news conference they called in prime time on a Tuesday to nominate Neil M. Gorsuch to the Supreme Court . Emailing a written statement to reporters just before a natural disaster is not the way to draw the spotlight .
It is impossible to completely hide news , of course , and anything as significant — and polarizing — as the way the country enforces immigration laws would have generated coverage long past Labor Day , anyway . The news dump ai n't what it used to be , in the days when information traveled mostly on paper .
But the effectiveness of a news dump in 2017 is beside the point ; the point is whether the president tries to slip one past us or boldly speaks their mind .
If Trump follows through on their campaign pledge , supporters might wonder why they did not do so on their first day in office , as promised , but they should be heartened by their willingness to make the announcement with fanfare .
And if they disappoint those same people by breaking their promise , perhaps they will get some credit for being upfront .
Joshua Starr Resigns As MCPS Superintendent
From Bethesda Now - By Aaron Kraut
Updated at 12:35 p.m. — MCPS Superintendent Joshua Starr and the Board of Education have agreed to part ways , ending the weeks-long drama surrounding Starr 's soon-to-expire contract .
Word of Starr 's resignation leaked through numerous media outlets on Tuesday morning as the Board met in a closed session .
At 11:30 a.m. , Board President Pat O'Neill — thought to be one of Starr 's remaining supporters in the eight-member group — quickly read a resolution announcing the resignation . The Board approved the move unanimously before moving to another room to hold a press conference .
“ Do n't get into a fight that you know you 're not going to win , ” Starr said during the press conference when asked why they resigned . O'Neill was the only member of the Board to take questions .
“ I am only one individual . It is part of a collective body and a collective process . The decision on any superintendent falls to those eight democratically elected , ” O'Neill said . “ There are eight different thoughts and opinions . ”
Larry Bowers , the school system 's chief operating officer , will serve as interim superintendent until at least June 30 .
Starr 's departure is a major surprise for the school system . They had expressed their desire to return for another four years , but reports suggested at least four Board members stood solidly against a contract renewal .
Without support from a majority of the Board , Starr did n't submit a required notification of their intent to remain as superintendent by the Sunday deadline .
Starr will serve as superintendent until Feb. 16 .
The Board of Education has been mum on what friction caused Starr 's departure .
The official resignation agreement includes a clause stating “ Board members and the Superintendent shall refrain from making disparaging remarks regarding the other . ”
“ No superintendent is bigger than the system that they or they lead and I understand and respect this Board 's desire to have a different leader and a different direction , ” Starr said in the press conference . “ It was my hope that I would be here to continue that work . …However I recognize and respect that the Board has the right to choose a leader of the school system . ”
When asked why they decided to resign , Starr said they agreed with the Board that it was in the best interest of MCPS to move on now .
“ The Board of Education has decided to have another quarterback , ” O'Neill said in the press conference . They avoided answering why the Board decided not to support Starr .
Starr later said they felt no need to fight the Board after it had shown there would be a lack of support .
Under the agreement approved Tuesday , Starr will receive the remainder of the salary they are owed under their contract , which runs until June 30 , a $ 46,583 payment for unused sick and annual leave in accordance with their contract , and health insurance benefits through the end of 2015 .
Maryland State Schools Superintendent Lillian Lowery must most approve Bowers ' appointment as MCPS superintendent before the switch can officially take place .
MCPS said it hopes to have a new superintendent in place by July 1 .
If you have a Blu-ray player and do n't want to or ca n't use a native Mac media player app , Mac Blu-ray Player can be used to view Blu-rays in addition to DVDs , but some may find the price tag for the full version too high .
The installation and setup of a free trial version of Mac Blu-ray Player for Mac went smoothly . The initial menus are intuitive and well-designed . The trial version will only function a limited number of times , however , before the user must buy the full version at $ 59.95 . Technical support is available , and the developer 's Web site is user-friendly . After we inserted a disc , the program recognized and started playing it quickly and cleanly . Menus for controlling the movie playback are easy to locate and use . In addition to DVDs and Blu-rays , the player can handle several other video file formats and those for audio . The program purports to allow users to include their own subtitles , though we did n't test this .
While Mac Blu-ray Player is well-designed and functional , those looking for a simple disc player app may find its high price off-putting . However , if you have an external Blu-ray player and your Mac does not have native software to accomodate it , this program may be an attractive option .
Editors ' note : This is a review of the trial version of Mac Blu-ray Player for Mac 2.7.6 .
It 's possible to make a case against gay marriage that does not rely on fear or loathing of gay people . That 's what was done when civil partnerships were brought in ; and there is a surprisingly long tradition of Christians doing it . In 1996 , for instance , Jim Thompson , then the bishop of Bath and Wells , published a book calling for what were in essence religiously sanctioned civil partnerships : `` I am in favour of strengthening the social support for gay people to have sustained , faithful and loving relationships by legal agreement and by the prayerful support of the church . ''
They said then that : `` One of the things that helps people towards fidelity in life is proper recognition by society . I do n't believe that recognition can be marriage ; but there ought to be a recognition of jointly held property in order that people will have things that bind them together . ''
I do n't think it 's breaking a confidence now to say that Thompson had told me privately a few years before that their policy was to ordain gay men only when they were in stable relationships .
Incidentally , in those days conservatives were defending marriage on the grounds that it was unnatural : the Rev David Holloway , one of the prime movers of the evangelical campaign against gay clergy , said then that , `` Marriage as it has developed is not biologically natural – to keep a father in a committed relationship you need a whole lot of other constraints . The gay issue is the motor for the whole programme of destabilising the sexual culture , and the effects of that on children are disastrous . ''
This seems to me more honest than the present line , largely taken over from the Vatican , that marriage ( understood as monogamous and heterosexual ) is something that has been around since the beginning of humanity . But it 's less politically persuasive . No one enjoys being told they need protecting from their own worse instincts ; and in a democracy the people get what they enjoy , so long as it does n't matter .
Yet the argument for civil partnerships , as against gay marriage , seems now to be lost . It has n't been won by the supporters of gay marriage . It has been lost by the nastiness of the opponents .
When Chris Sugden and Philip Giddings of Anglican Mainstream released their letter to the prime minister last week they can not have understood just how foul-spirited and pharisaical it makes them appear . They have been taken seriously for so long within the power structures of the Church of England that they have quite lost touch with the sanity of the outside world . They founded their pressure group to oppose the appointment of a celibate gay man as a bishop . Yet they claim in their letter that `` those who experience the attraction '' – they wo n't talk about `` love '' – `` have always been fully welcomed '' .
Condescending and pompous to the end – they finish with the assurance to the prime minister of their continued prayers – this letter discredits all opposition to gay marriage . It 's obvious that what they really want is for gay people to feel ashamed and to exist on sufferance . The only thing tending to acquit them of a rather unpleasant prejudice is that their smug condescension is n't only directed at homosexuals . Evangelicals of that sort want everyone who 's not like them to feel ashamed of their existence . `` We are all sinners '' , they say , but they think they know they and their friends are saved .
Catholic bishops , too , suffer a terrible disconnect from the ordinary moral sense of the world outside . When Philip Tartaglia 's claim that a Scots MP ( and former Catholic priest ) who died of pancreatitis at the age of 44 did so as a result of being gay surfaced to general outrage last week , few people noticed that they were speaking at a conference on religious freedom .
`` I can say with a concerned and fearful realism that the loss of religious freedom is now arguably the most serious threat that the Catholic church and all people of faith in this country are facing , '' they had said . `` Will the Catholic church – and other religious bodies and groups – have the space to adhere to , express and teach their beliefs in the public square ? Or will these basic elements of religious freedom be denied , driving the Church and other religious bodies to the margins of society , if not actually underground ? ''
What 's crazy about this `` concerned and fearful realism '' is that they give every appearance of believing their own propaganda . They confuse losing an argument with losing the right to argue . There are actually genuine issues of religious freedom and toleration raised by some recent administrative decisions against opponents of gay marriage . But they have arisen because the argument about equality is already lost .
The argument about civil partnerships and fairness ca n't convincingly be put by people who have been unfair whenever they thought they could get away with it .
WASHINGTON -- Reps. Sam Farr ( D-Calif. ) , Dana Rohrabacher ( R-Calif. ) and Maurice Hinchey ( D-N.Y. ) have joined forces in an effort to cut off funding for the federal government 's ramped-up enforcement actions around medical marijuana .
The lawmakers ' bipartisan legislation , which would prohibit the use of federal funds to interfere with state pot laws , is expected to hit the House floor as part of a broader debate over a bill , H.R . 5326 , that funds the Department of Justice .
`` Patients suffering from painful and serious illnesses are following the recommendations of their doctors by using medical cannabis to minimize their pain and support their recovery , '' Rep. Farr told HuffPost in a statement Tuesday afternoon . `` It is time for the federal government to stop targeting the legal vendors that are providing safe access to this treatment , and instead focus limited resources on those who sell illicit drugs . The amendment I will offer with my colleagues will work to assure funds under the Department of Justice do not target the safe access to treatment patients need . ”
The Justice Department did not immediately return a request for comment .
The bill comes as the administration has unleashed an interagency crackdown on the cannabis industry , with more than 100 raids , primarily on California pot dispensaries , many of them operating in full compliance with state laws . Since October 2009 , the Justice Department has conducted more than 170 aggressive SWAT-style raids in nine medical marijuana states , resulting in at least 61 federal indictments , according to data compiled by Americans for Safe Access , an advocacy group . Federal authorities have also seized property from landlords who rent space to growers , threatening them with prosecution , and authorities have even considered taking action against newspapers selling ad space to dispensaries .
The bipartisan legislation could come up for debate as soon as Tuesday night . The full text of the amendment reads :
Change comes slowly but inevitably , and in Toronto that means condominiums . The stretch of Yonge Street between Bloor and College , that final ungentrified stretch of smut peddlers , head shops , and bootleg vendors is going upscale bringing with it the promise of one-bedrooms from the mid 200 's . I ca n't lie that I 'm happy to see some of the stuff south of Wellesley go . Having worked in the neighbourhood for several years , the seediness of it never appealed to me ; facades held over from decades when the strip was a jukebox neon river of amusement . It was the era of Ronnie Hawkins ' camel walk and later of Goin ' Down the Road . Somehow it took until now for developers to look at the spent husk of one long Saturday night and judge it fit for rehabilitation .
One of the casualties of that vertically emergent lifestyle is Bar Volo . I know that it was unavoidable . In point of fact , Ralph Morana has been talking about it for years . Where they might start up a second location or , during conversation on the patio , exasperatedly gesturing at the enormous building across the street that was now blotting out their customers ' sunlight .
In truth , I have not spent very much time at Bar Volo over the last five years . I was more or less a regular between 2007 and 2011 when an in crowd would take up as much as half of the patio on Friday and Monday nights . Friday tended to draw more of a ratebeer crowd while Monday , with its five dollar pints , catered to those who enjoyed cask ale . Sometimes the unstated goal of the Monday crowd was to see how long it would take to finish off the remainder of the weekend 's cask so that something more interesting might be substituted . A good time was had by all .
Unfortunately , in 2011 , a good friend I had made at Volo passed away and it never really seemed the same afterwards standing at the bar by myself . Sometimes at about this time of year Tim Mitchell 's sudden passing still prompts melancholy and an unwanted consciousness of the fragility of life . They were a lovely man .
If I 'm honest , the thing I like best about Volo is its nearly complete dedication to rebirth . I might not pop my head in for four or five months and something will have changed . Now they 've switched to bar service only . Now the taps are alphabetized . Now the number of casks has expanded . Now there 's a variety of upper tier Bourbons for your delectation . Now they 're importing beer from Texas . Now there 's an outdoor bar .
I walk down Yonge Street some nights for entertainment as much as exercise and I noted the outdoor chalkboard on my way past the patio late last month . Not a single beer on the 26 tap list existed a decade ago when I started going there . It is impossible to overstate the importance of Bar Volo as an agent of change in Ontario 's beer culture .
Change accrues through effort and through dedication and through the simple will to pile it up . At the moment we have dozens of craft beer friendly bars in the city and more to come . In the middle of the last decade we did n't . I do n't mean to take anything away from stalwarts like beerbistro or Smokeless Joe 's . They also played their part . Bar Volo was the one that challenged brewer and drinker alike to be better . The identity has always been somewhat schizoid ; celebrating the best of the local scene while acting as a showcase for rare imports . This month we will have both Cask Days and Zwanze Day and that duality sums it up : Local and fresh versus distant and funky . The ability to comfortably enjoy the best we have while dreaming of the things that we do n't .
There is an argument to be made that beer is memetic . That because it is designed it is an expression of thought and that in drinking you 're perceiving intent and information . In that sense , Volo has been an informational hub quite unlike anything else we 've seen in Toronto .
Frequently it resulted in the long game . Imports from Flying Dog and Moylan 's and Great Divide showed people what the Americans were doing and allowed them to go away and think about what could be done . A Stone takeover ( captured for posterity in Ian Coutts ' book Brew North where I 'm in the back row of the photo ) featuring a portion of the vertical epic series showed us that a decade long project was possible at a time when people were still hesitant to brew one-offs . Cask Days and the IPA Challenge allowed brewers to succeed and to fail and most importantly to play without much consequence hanging in the balance . It encouraged them to try . More than any other single factor in the last decade , Bar Volo allowed us the conversation that has helped Ontario 's beer industry blossom . On a day-to-day level it exposed good beer to any number of people . I doubt you 'll find anyone in the beer industry in Ontario who does n't have fond memories and a story to recount . There 's no one that has n't been influenced by it in some way .
I have always harbored the suspicion that the Moranas knew all of this and were doing it on purpose , sort of agents provocateur for the zymurgical set . When I accused Ralph of it some years ago they denied it was intentional , but there was a twinkle in their eye . This will be Bar Volo 's last week , but their mission has probably been accomplished for some time .
Change comes slowly , but change has come . Bar Volo will finally split its personalities into two separate locations . Birreria Volo on College West will focus on wild and sour beers while Bar Volo on Church will presumably embrace cask beers . We will end up with two great beer bars instead of one , but it wo n't be the same . If you 've never experienced the original location , you owe it to yourself to get some concept of it before the end of the week . I plan on trudging down myself at some point and exorcising a little memory .
Besides , they 've got Monday pricing all week long .

The Royal Bank of Canada scrapped an internal limit on mortgage loan size for immigrants in the spring to tap into surging demand for financing on multi-million dollar houses by newcomers to Vancouver .
Wealthy buyers , mostly from China , are fueling a booming mortgage business in Vancouver , where the median price for a detached home on the desirable west side jumped 31 per cent to $ 2.87 million in the last two years .
RBC , Canada 's largest bank , removed its $ 1.25 million caps on loans to borrowers with no local credit history in May , said Christine Shisler , the bank 's Director of Multicultural Markets , who works with an immigrant clientele .
`` We 're seeing a lot of affluent newcomers looking to buy high-purchase price homes , '' they said . `` Now we can actually service any mortgage amount . ''
A case study released on Monday , which looked at six months worth of detached home sales in prime neighbourhoods near the University of British Columbia ( UBC ) main campus , found that two-thirds of buyers had names typical of people from mainland China and 88 per cent of those people also had a mortgage . The mortgages , on homes ranging in value from $ 1.25 million to more than $ 9 million , were mainly backed by three banks — HSBC Canada , Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce ( CIBC ) and Bank of Montreal ( BMO ) .
RBC held just 8 per cent of the loans . The banks have not broken out the size or profitability of this business segment .
Andy Yan , an urban planner and adjunct professor at UBC who studied land titles linked to 172 sales transactions from Aug. 2014 to Feb. 2015 , said the financing was the most surprising part of the study . `` It counters a lot of our mythologies , in terms of this idea of people showing up with very large bags of money and paying cash , '' they said .
'We do need far better federal and provincial tracking of data on international investment and absentee ownership . What we do n't need , however , is the blaming of any one group of people — or any one kind of last name — for the challenge of housing affordability . - Gregor Robertson , Vancouver mayor
Vancouver Mayor Gregor Robertson posted a comment on their Facebook page Monday in which they acknowledged that housing affordability is a major issue in the city and proposed measures the provincial and federal government could take to help address it .
`` A speculation tax would help slow down the practice of flipping houses , which too often leaves middle-income earners priced out of the market , '' Robertson wrote . `` A luxury housing tax would ensure that the very wealthiest buyers or investors pay an added price , which we could put towards building new affordable housing for those on low and modest incomes .
`` And yes , we do need far better federal and provincial tracking of data on international investment and absentee ownership . What we do n't need , however , is the blaming of any one group of people — or any one kind of last name — for the challenge of housing affordability . ''
No official data
While there is no official data on foreign ownership in Canada , realtors who work in Vancouver 's luxury market say more than 80 per cent of buyers has ties to mainland China , with demand strong despite this summer 's Chinese stock market plunge and President Xi Jinping 's corruption crackdown .
Yan 's case study , using a name analysis method pioneered in public health and academic studies , found that 66 per cent of buyers in their sample had non-Anglicized Chinese names .
A separate Reuters survey of land titles linked to sales in a broader swath of Vancouver west had a near identical result . To be sure , some of these individuals could be Canadian citizens or long-time residents , though Yan notes the majority have ambiguous job titles like `` homemaker '' or `` businessperson , '' which may point to money being earned abroad .
Indeed , the most common occupation for the new owners of these multi-million dollar properties was `` homemaker . ''
That raises questions over how banks , in the rush to tap into the market , are not only ensuring their clients have the means to make hefty mortgage payments , but also whether they have enough information on the source of funds . `` I do worry that we 're being friendly , polite Canadians and not asking too many questions , '' said David Eby , the provincial lawmaker for the Vancouver neighbourhood in Yan 's study . `` There are a lot of people making a lot of money right now . ''
Compliance concerns
Both RBC and HSBC Canada said that anti-money laundering compliance is a priority , though declined to provide specific details on how exactly they ensure legitimacy of funds .
CIBC and BMO did not immediately provide comment on their newcomer mortgage policies . `` We have a very low tolerance for risk , '' said Aurora Bonin , a spokesperson for HSBC in Vancouver . `` You would have to prove , through documentation , where your income is coming from . ''
Yan 's study , meanwhile , found that 94 per cent of homemakers had mortgages on their properties , and that there were more students buying multi-million dollar homes than doctors .
That could pose risks , as highlighted in one divorce case where the China-residing husband , after separating from their wife , defaulted on a $ 1 million mortgage they took out on the purchase of a $ 2.3 million home for their wife and children .
Canada 's bank regulator , the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions , noted that there are no limits imposed on lending to newcomers or offshore buyers , but that banks must do their due diligence as per the department 's guidelines .
The major banks all have Chinese-language websites to promote their newcomer products , and both RBC and HSBC said that their teams in Vancouver are diligent in making sure new clients pass all their checks . `` Obviously we 're responsible lenders , we 're not going to give a mortgage out for C $ 5 million if we have n't assessed that that 's the need and there 's a capacity for that particular client , '' said RBC 's Shisler .

The NRL therefore will adopt an auction approach to the sale of the Newcastle club , seeking a figure between $ 10 million and $ 20 million . On the block : The Newcastle Knights have struggled this year . Credit : Jonathan Carroll The NRL 's Head of Club Services , Tony Crawford , said that `` at the point we exit our shareholding , we clearly have an eye to the market around football clubs , but equally we will ensure the new ownership acts in the interest of the club , the community and the game '' . While past owner Nathan Tinkler has been lampooned for their flight attendantship , they did leave the Knights debt-free and with $ 6.7 million in cash from day one of the NRL takeover . Certainly , other debts have surfaced and the club has a $ 2.5 million over three years loan facility with the NRL , with $ 1 million already drawn and the possibility of calling on a further $ 1 million .
The new owner will need to buy a competitive team , insofar as the NRL inherited an ageing roster following Tinkler 's dictate to former coach , Wayne Bennett , to `` win me a premiership '' . The obvious buyer of the Knights , the wealthy Wests Newcastle group of seven licensed premises , claims to be a reluctant partner . `` We see ourselves as owners of the last resort , '' said the chief executive of the Wests Group , Phil Gardner , who sits on the board of the Knights as an appointee of the NRL , rather than their employer . While the NRL under former chief executive Dave Smith saw the Wests Group as a logical partner of the Knights , being a stable community-based organisation with a membership passionate about their NRL team , Gardner hinted there may be other interested potential investors . `` There will be interest from unusual people when the ownership issue is approached , '' they predicted , a reference to local half-billionaires who attended a recent meeting to discuss third-party opportunities with players .
While the NRL has made it clear existing debts have to be satisfied in conjunction with ownership restructures , Gardner denied that inheriting debt was a roadblock to a Wests Newcastle takeover . `` We have not had any discussion with the NRL over debt because there has been no discussion with them over ownership , '' they said . However , other sources insist Gardner , a sharp negotiator , put up their hand for ownership of the Knights with a $ 1 offer the day the NRL took it over . They certainly present a parlous position of the Knights in the post-Tinkler days . `` We got an empty money bag from Tinkler , '' they said , `` But the NRL has been fantastic for the Knights , particularly Tony Crawford who has done a great job . They saved the day . We were looking at liquidation . The club was in a terrible position .
`` We 're a test tube baby , '' Gardner added , describing Tinkler as `` a power of one '' , a single owner who burnt off all other commercial opportunities in Newcastle . `` Somewhere there is an outcome , and we 've been a consistent supporter since the Knights were formed in 1988 . `` In any year , we could have taken them over but we 've never moved to even part ownership because we always thought of the Knights as a separate entity . '' Hmmm . `` The game is incredibly expensive to run . Even billionaires find it hard to stay . Third-party deals have pushed the expenses out further , '' they said , treading the delicate path of NRL-appointed board member and representative of a potential buyer .
DFL Sen. Al Franken was one target of an illegal psychological warfare campaign led by a US Army unit in Afghanistan , according to a story published in the latest issue of Rolling Stone magazine .
The unit was assigned to Afghanistan to ‚Äú assess the effects of U.S. propaganda on the Taliban. ‚Äù But they were soon ordered by Lt. Gen. William Caldwell , who 's in charge of training Afghan troops , to use their expertise to influence visiting lawmakers and pressure them into providing more funding for the war effort .
The campaign reportedly targeted VIPs traveling to Afghanistan , including Franken , fellow Sens . John McCain , Joe Lieberman , Jack Levin and Jack Reed as well as members of the House of Representatives , members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and foreign dignitaries .
The story says of the psy-ops campaign directed at lawmakers , ‚Äú there is no way to tell what , if any , influence it had on American policy , ‚Äù but notes that one of the biggest supporters of increased funding for the war effort was Sen. Carl Levin , one of the campaign 's targets .
The unit 's commander , Lt. Col. Michael Holmes , tried to resist the orders , which they considered illegal under U.S. law . When Holmes raised their concerns , they were reportedly countermanded by higher-ups and disciplined .
A spokesperson for Gen. Caldwell told Rolling Stone categorically denied the magazine 's assertions .
The story was written by journalist Michael Hastings , who broke the news last year that members of Afghanistan commander Gen. Stanley McChrystal 's staff were disparaging the Obama Administration 's policies in the region . McChrystal was relieved of their duties and resigned their commission after the story came out .
MPR News has asked Sen. Franken 's office for a reaction to the story but has not yet received a response .
UPDATE : Sen. Franken 's office just provided us with the following statement :
‚Äú Along with Senator Carl Levin , I participated in a CODEL and made a visit to Kabul in January 2010 , during which time Lt. Gen. William Caldwell , Commander , NATO Training Mission ‚Äì Afghanistan , and several others briefed me on the progress being made in the country . While the briefings provided me with a helpful update on what was happening on the ground , I knew that I would have to crosscheck their assessment by talking to other military officials , diplomatic officials , outside experts and troops in the field , and I always raise skeptical questions when discussing this topic .
‚Äú Although this was my first trip to Afghanistan as a senator , it was my fifth trip to the country since the war started , and I 've learned that to get a clear sense of what 's happening on the ground you have to talk to everyone from privates to generals . My perspective on the effort in Afghanistan is the product of countless face-to-face meetings with soldiers and marines , Pentagon officials , State Department officials , outside experts and my constituents in Minnesota , as well as extensive review of reports and classified material . I 'll continue to solicit the best advice from the most knowledgeable people as the situation in Afghanistan evolves . ‚Äù

Benjamin Wittes at the Lawfare Blog has written a terrific explainer on what the NDAA does , and does not do .
Key point rebutting the contention that the indefinite detention provisions apply to United States citizens :
Section 1022 purports not merely to authorize but to require military custody for a subset of those who are subject to detention under Section 1021 . In particular , it requires that the military hold ‚Äú a covered person ‚Äù pending disposition under the law of war if that person is ‚Äú a member of , or part of , al-Qaeda or an associated force that acts in coordination with or pursuant to the direction of al-Qaeda ‚Äù and is participating in an attack against the United States or its coalition partners . The president is allowed to waive this requirement for national security reasons . The provision exempts U.S. citizens entirely , and it applies to lawful permanent resident aliens for conduct within the United States to whatever extent the Constitution permits . It requires the administration to promulgate procedures to make sure its requirements do not interfere with basic law enforcement functions in counterterrorism cases . And it insists that ‚Äú Nothing in this section shall be construed to affect the existing criminal enforcement and national security authorities of the Federal Bureau of Investigation or any other domestic law enforcement agency with regard to a covered person , regardless whether such covered person is held in military custody . ‚Äù
And this point regarding Guantanamo Bay facilities :
Sections 1026 and 1027 prevent the use of federal funds for building detention facilities in the United States or transferring Guantanamo detainees to domestic facilities or releasing them into the United States . It effectively continues a congressional policy of preventing more Article III criminal trials of Guantanamo detainees and preventing the construction of alternative facilities that would enable President Obama to fulfill their promise to shutter Guantanamo .
I have argued for a very long time that Congress , not the President , was responsible for the failure to close Guantanamo , mostly to deaf ears . This bill passed with a huge bipartisan majority in both houses , so I 'm unsure how anyone but Congress can own this now .
Wittes has more on that later in the post :
Yes . The NDAA does three things that make it impossible , at least during fiscal year 2012 , for President Obama to fulfill their promise to close the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay . It forbids them to spend any money readying an alternative site to house detainees in the United States . It forbids transfers of detainees to the United States . And it makes it difficult‚Äìthough a little less difficult than it is under the current spending restrictions‚Äìto transfer detainees to third countries . To close Guantanamo , the administration would have to transfer a bunch of detainees to other countries , and it would have to move a bunch of other detainees to some alternative facility . So as long as these restrictions exist in U.S. law , Guantanamo is going nowhere . These restrictions , it is worth noting , are already in current law . So while they are ( in our opinion ) bad ideas , they are by no means new the NDAA .
Finally , there is this bit which should actually please civil libertarians . It was added as part of the negotiation after the President 's veto threat :
Section 1024 of the bill , as we 've noted , requires that people subject to long-term military detention in circumstances not already subject to habeas corpus review‚Äìthink the Detention Facility in Parwan , Afghanistan‚Äìhenceforth shall have the right to a military lawyer and a proceeding before a military judge in order to contest the government 's factual basis for believing them to be subject to detention . This is an extraordinary and novel development . Detainees in Afghanistan currently have access to the Detainee Review Board process , which as described in this article already provide a relatively robust screening mechanism , particularly compared to years past . The DRB process does not include lawyers and judges , however , and human rights advocacy groups have criticized them on this ground . Requiring lawyers and judges to staff out the screening process is a pretty remarkable shift in the direction of accomodating those concerns .
This is the most cogent explanation of the counterterrorism provisions in the NDAA ( which covers far , far more than this ) I 've seen .
As far as the politics go , when both houses of Congress have passed it with a veto-proof majority , I doubt there will be a veto forthcoming . The President could sign it and add a signing statement to the more troubling provisions . While this would certainly get some criticism from the right wing given their criticism of President Bush 's use of signing statements , a signing statement would offer some clarity and political cover for signing a bill that had no hope of having a veto sustained . But whether or not they decide to go that route , it 's worth reading and bookmarking Witte 's post for reference , because the misinformation is flying around the Internet in a swarm right now . Ron Paul supporters , in particular , seem to be spreading mountains of misinformation . But that 's a story for another post .

If you were n't sure where the line should be drawn when it comes to Hollywood 's fascination with reboots and remakes , Leprechaun : Origins has done you a favor and drawn it , clear as day , in the sand . On one side is the astounding awfulness that is Leprechaun : Origins and , on the other side , is everything else .
The original Leprechaun films are terrible too , but at least they were aware of their quality . Origins ' biggest offense is taking itself so seriously that it is unable to leverage its greatest asset : its ludicrous plot . We join two young couples backpacking across Ireland , where they intend to look at some historical landmarks in a small village . Unfortunately for them , the village has quite a bit of business going on underneath its skin‚Ä¶ namely a leprechaun that comes hunting for their gold that the villagers pillaged . To atone for their mistakes and appease the leprechaun , the villagers have been luring ‚Äú outsiders ‚Äù to a remote cabin as a sacrifice to the creature .
Exit Theatre Mode
The tone of the film requires that you invest in Hornswoggle 's Leprechaun so completely as to be terrified of it , yet the monster ‚Äì what we do see of it ‚Äì is never able to look like anything other than a Halloween mask with some goop on it . To their credit , the filmmakers do their best to hide this shortcoming with obfuscated shots , quick cuts , soft focus , and the use of Killer Cam , but it 's just not enough to hide the fact that they 've concocted themselves an un-scary monster . And if you 're a Hornswoggle fan looking to get a glimpse at the WWE Superstar , well , you 're out of luck . They do n't have one line nor do you ever see their face .
The film is built around this creature being a threat , yet it simply is n't threatening . The use of Killer Cam is particularly uninspired , not to mention inconsistent . Sometimes it 's just normal Evil Dead-style Killer Cam and other times it 's Predator-style radar . If there 's a reason behind to the fluctuations , the movie fails to articulate it .
Worse than all of this , Leprechaun : Origins is the very definition of generic . The leprechaun creature could be replaced with any psychopath from any slasher movie and nothing would change . It 'd feature the same kills , the same scares , the same methods of attack , and the same dopey characters trying to get away in the same dopey fashion .
The few bright spots to be found in the movie quickly dissipate due to a lack of follow-through ; early on in the first leprechaun attack , two of the characters have the chance to help a fallen friend but decide instead that it 's every man for themselves . After that friend survives , the movie does n't bother to mine any drama from that , they simply go on as though they had n't just left their friend to be ripped to shreds .
There 's another moment , the film 's best kill ‚Äì the only genuinely entertaining moment in the entirety of the movie ‚Äì that is equally wasted . The circumstances should be a big beat for the filmmakers to linger on and create some extra tension and drama , yet it 's as though no action from any character in this movie has any consequences .
Exit Theatre Mode
There 's also a subplot involving one of the villagers and their son that 's severely undeveloped , and the main characters are so bland that you wo n't know their names before they start being offed by the so-called leprechaun . I know B-movie characters are meant to be cannon fodder , but watching cardboard cutouts getting eaten is n't all that much fun .
A Palestinian man cleans up after a UN food distribution center was badly damaged in an Israeli airstrike on Jabalia refugee camp in the northern Gaza Strip on 18 November . Majdi Fathi APA images
UNRWA , the UN agency for Palestine refugees , has hit back at Israeli allegations , made through social media , that it allows schools it runs in the Gaza Strip to be used by Palestinian forces to launch rockets towards Israel .
‚Äú The United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East ( UNRWA ) denies allegations made online by the IDF Spokesperson that Palestinian militants are using UNRWA schools or facilities in Gaza to fire rockets into Israel , ‚Äù the agency said in a press release today .
The statement came on the seventh continuous day of Israeli bombardment of the Gaza Strip , which has so far claimed 124 lives , more than two dozen of them children , and injured over 800 people .
Israel 's ‚Äú creation ‚Äù of video footage for propaganda
Screenshot from an Israeli army propaganda video shows an animation of a UN-run school being used to launch rockets .
UNRWA criticized Israel 's fabrication of material and its dissemination via social media :
On 17 November 2012 at 22:16 , the Israeli Defense Forces tweeted from their official Twitter account ( @ IDFSpokesperson ) a link to a video hosted on their official YouTube channel , featuring an animated film that depicts militants firing rockets from a school clearly marked with the UNRWA insignia . UNRWA is concerned about the creation and use of footage that wrongly suggests that UNRWA is allowing its premises to be used for terrorist activities in the current conflict and the unauthorised use of its logo in computer-generated material . In a situation of conflict these allegations have potentially grave consequences . UNRWA takes with utmost seriousness the neutrality of its installations , particularly in times of heightened violence .
False allegations , but real death , injury and damage to UNRWA affiliated persons and facilities
Israel has long alleged ‚Äì without evidence ‚Äì and using fabricated graphic material that schools and hospitals are used as military sites , in order to justify its frequent attacks on them .
UNRWA said in an 18 November situation report that among its facilities damaged in the ongoing Israeli attacks , were the Shejaya Elementary Co-ed School which sustained severe damage to the boundary wall and the school building .
Marwan Abu El Qumsan , an Arabic teacher in their early fifties , at UNRWA 's Preparatory Boys School in Jabalia , was killed while in their car in an Israeli airstrike on 15 November , and on 18 November a Grade 4 student died following an Israeli air attack in an open area near Beach Camp .
Separately , UNRWA said that its workers have rebuilt a food distribution center in the Jabalia refugee camp badly damaged in an Israeli airstrike on 18 November .
Image caption The UK 's Tamil population is highly critical of the Sri Lankan government 's human rights record
A group of 25 Sri Lankans deported from the UK has arrived in Sri Lanka , amid warnings that Tamils among them may be tortured .
UK officials said on Wednesday that 60 failed asylum seekers and visa overstayers were being sent back .
But many won last-minute court injunctions preventing their return .
Human rights groups say that some Tamils who were sent back are in danger of being tortured because of their alleged links to separatist rebels .
Sri Lanka 's civil war came to an end in 2009 , after 26 years of conflict and up to 100,000 casualties as the Tamil Tigers fought for self-rule .
International Organisation of Migration ( IOM ) officials told the BBC 's Charles Haviland at Colombo 's international airport that there were 25 people on board the chartered flight from the UK .
Thirteen people among the returnees are Tamils , officials say , along with eight Muslims and four Sinhalese people .
Our correspondent says that families of those Tamils who were sent back waited anxiously at the airport as their loved ones were quizzed by the authorities and released .
Torture allegations
Right groups say that in previous cases , Tamil returnees have been arrested some time after coming back and in some cases tortured . The Sri Lankan government denies this . Both it and the UK have insisted that those being sent back are not in danger of being mistreated .
Analysis There were emotional scenes as those deportees with families to greet them arrived home , some after more than 10 years in Britain . Hugs were exchanged with parents , wives and siblings . Whatever their misgivings about being deported , most looked happy . Those without waiting families were less conspicuous , and all were met by officials of the International Organisation for Migration , who disbursed cash for their travel home . The special flight touched down early on Wednesday and the deportees came through throughout the day . On landing each was questioned by the Criminal Investigation Department , who exchanged faxes with government officials to clear their entry . Earlier many waiting relatives were anxious . Tamils especially said their sons had been picked on by the security forces before leaving Sri Lanka - repeatedly hauled in for questioning or even beaten because they came from the north or were suspected of Tamil Tiger involvement .
The IOM says that while its officials are in no way involved in the deportation process , it will provide financial help for the returnees to be reunited with their families .
Presidential adviser Rajiva Wijesinha said on Wednesday that Britain itself had established that returnees would not be tortured . They said most of those being deported were economic migrants .
Britain says that unless a Sri Lankan Tamil was a high-level activist with the separatist Tamil Tiger rebel group , they or they are unlikely to be targeted on returning to Sri Lanka .
But human rights groups such as Freedom from Torture and Human Rights Watch argue that Tamil people either linked or perceived to be linked to the Tigers - at any level - are at risk if they return .
One Tamil man due to have been sent back told the BBC on Wednesday : `` Instead of getting killed there I would far rather commit suicide in the UK . ''
A man now on their second asylum application in Britain also told the BBC on Wednesday that they were beaten , deprived of sleep and almost suffocated in polythene and petrol by the Sri Lankan police when they were made to return .
The UK Border Agency says the removal of a person only happens where it is satisfied that they or they have no protection needs .
Both Freedom from Torture and Human Rights Watch say that they have interviewed nearly 40 people who subsequently escaped back to Britain and gave accounts of alleged torture by the Sri Lankan authorities which the groups say is medically verified .
So now we have a possible motive for the two public relations guys demolishing the East Austin pi√±ata store in such a hurry .
On Tuesday , just a few days after Jumpolin , at 1401 E. Cesar Chavez St. , was turned into rubble , the owners of the property got approval from the city to hold a promotional shindig during South by Southwest , Austin 's world-famous music festival . The event , to occur where the pi√±ata store used to be , is scheduled for March 14 .
So no wonder Jordan French and their business partner , Darius Fisher , who bought the property in October , were in such a rush to knock over the building .
Time 's a-wastin ' , folks . Wonder who 's playing at this party ? Benny & the Bulldozers ? Freddy and the Flatlanders ? I mean the Flattened Landers ?
Meanwhile , Monica and Sergio Lejarazu , who owned the pi√±ata shop , are suing French and Fisher . Can you blame them ? The store 's records , pi√±atas and other party goods , computers , cash register and photographs were still in the store .
And what 's next for this spot ? A posh high-rise called One Pi√±ata Place ?
Incidentally , SXSW officials point out that this event is n't affiliated with SXSW . No surprise there . They 're not that stupid .
OK , folks , how about a little irony with your morning coffee ?
French is the CEO of Status Labs , a public relations firm in the business of helping its clients improve their image .
`` Do n't let a single event ruin the reputation you 've taken years to build , '' it says on the company 's Web page .
How will destroying a small family business for personal gain enhance Status Labs ' reputation ? If that 's good PR , then I 'm Ralph Waldo Emerson .
So on Thursday , after this brilliant PR move , protesters lined the street in front of the property , carrying signs that said , `` Stop the Gentrification Mafia , '' `` Justice For Jumpolin '' and `` We Are People Not Cockroaches . ''
That last message is the result of French , in another brilliant PR moment , comparing the demolition in a news story to spraying for bugs .
As usual , there are two sides to every story , although commonly at least one of them is wrong .
French contends that their tenants , the pi√±ata store owners , were behind on their rent and that they 'd been told to get out of the building .
Meanwhile , Doran Peters , the attorney working for the store owners , says they were all paid up on their rent and that French and Fisher broke the law when they had the place leveled .
Peters says that under the law , if the landlord wants to regain possession of the property , they have to file an eviction action . You call the justice of the peace , fill out a form and then pay a modest filing fee . Next , a judge holds a hearing and decides who gets to keep possession of the property , the landlord or the renter .
`` Fisher and French did not go through that process , '' Peters said . `` Instead , they exercised an illegal self-help remedy . ''
I called French twice and left messages . They do n't call ; they do n't write . No surprise there . I would n't call me , either .
This is not the first time French and Fisher have run into PR problems of their own . A couple of years ago they got a cease and desist letter from the people who run Wikipedia , the online encyclopedia , telling them to stop messing with their copy .
Then there was the CNBC story that said one of its freelance writers had received a pitch from Status Labs saying it would gladly pay for news stories mentioning their clients `` in a natural , organic way . ''
In this case , natural and organic came with a payoff . The size of the paycheck for such a story , the pitch explained , `` varies wildly depending on quality of the secured hit . '' The pitch said the company had paid as much as `` a dollar per word . ''
Wow . Maybe I should count up the words here and send Status Labs a bill .
I made a goof in my column last Sunday about the Horseshoe Lounge .
The guy who stayed out all night drinking , then had to come up with an excuse to tell their wife , goes by the nickname Bootie , not Dootie . Charles `` Bootie '' West , a retired mail carrier , has been a fixture at the Horseshoe since it opened 50 years ago .

Devon Alexander is trying not to dwell on their fight against Amir Khan falling through .
Alexander and Khan were tentatively scheduled to square off Dec. 7 , but the fight did n't materialize and Alexander ( 25-1 , 14 KOs ) instead will defend their IBF welterweight title against Shawn Porter ( 22-0-1 , 14 KOs ) that night at Barclays Center in Brooklyn . The St. Louis native declined to speculate on Khan 's decision to go in a different direction on a conference call Tuesday , though they indicated Khan 's handlers might 've considered a fight against them too risky because England 's Khan ( 28-3 , 19 KOs ) is a potential opponent for Floyd Mayweather Jr. ( 45-0 , 26 KOs ) .
‚Äú You have to be a true champion and a true fighter , ‚Äù Alexander said . ‚Äú I 'm an old-school fighter and I 'll fight anybody . ‚Ä¶ There are a lot of rumors out there about why Khan pulled out , why this , what that . But I ca n't speak on that . I wanted the fight because I know that fight would 've given me the notoriety that I need , that I 'm one of the best welterweights in the division . And , you know , it did n't happen .
‚Äú Who knows what he 's thinking and what their team 's doing ? I do n't know . I think that they thought I was a big risk , that I was too much right now for them or whatever . I do n't know . But I was ready to fight them in December , but they pulled out , so it did n't happen that way . ‚Äù
The 26-year-old Alexander also was supposed to encounter another British boxer earlier this year , yet that fight was postponed three times , first due to undefeated Kell Brook 's ankle injury , a second time due to Alexander 's biceps injury and third time because Brook suffered a foot injury . Brook ( 31-0 , 21 KOs ) has won twice since their shot at Alexander was postponed a third time . The second of those wins , a fourth-round stoppage of Ukraine 's Vyacheslav Senchenko ( 34-2 , 23 KOs ) on Oct. 26 in Sheffield , England , came in another IBF elimination match that enabled Brook to maintain their No . 1 spot in the IBF 's 147-pound rankings .
If Alexander tops Porter , who 's rated No . 6 by the IBF , an Alexander-Brook bout probably would be scheduled for the fourth time at some point within the first half of 2014 .
‚Äú Kell Brook fell through and the Amir Khan fight fell through , which both would 've been great wins for me , ‚Äù Alexander said . ‚Äú But everything happens for a reason . If the fighters do n't want it , if they do n't want to get in the ring with me , what can I do ? The only thing I can do is trust in my team to give me the best opponents , the best things that I need at the time . ‚Äù

‚Äú Birch Street , Higgins Drive , Cobalt Lane , ‚Äù titular star of Marvel 's Jessica Jones repeats to themselves in the first episode . I connected immediately . I knew that Jessica was a survivor before the show chose to reveal this to us . They elbow a bus window during a flashback , and they down booze straight from the bottle when the nightmares are too tough . I was n't entirely sure what they were a survivor of‚Äîrape , assault , abuse , attempted murder‚Äîbut it did n't matter . In those moments , Jessica Jones and I were one and the same . Many television shows and movies attempt to use rape as a plotline , but most fail . In Jessica Jones , we are given a fresh story from the survivor 's perspective , but we are also smart enough that the show does n't give us their abuser as an always-deplorable villain with whom we ca n't relate . Kilgrave , as the shown goes on , has their own nuances , and was victim to a very dehumanizing childhood despite their parents ' good intentions . I 'm a queer rape and abuse survivor . In many ways , Jessica Jones both as a series and as a character was cathartic and filled a need that few other shows have managed to fill . Early in the season , we learn that the series is n't shy about including queer characters , either , with the selfish Jeri Hogarth as a prime example that being gay does n't always mean your partner will treat you with respect . ( And thank goodness for that‚ÄîI ca n't stand another person telling me that I 'm lucky to be with a woman because , unlike men , women are incapable of being cheaters , liars or assholes . ) My experience differs from Jessica 's , but at its core , still feels very much the same . My rapist and abuser was a woman , so when I say I 'm a queer survivor , I mean not only that I identify as bisexual , but also that my experience as a survivor is already queer , already ‚Äú othered. ‚Äù I 'm on the outskirts , even as a rape survivor when I admit that my rapist was n't a man . My rapist also did n't possess Kilgrave 's powers of direct mind manipulation , but Jessica puts it best when they say , ‚Äú Not only did you physically rape me , you violated every cell in my body and every thought in my goddamn head . ‚Äù

A few weeks ago I started a series of posts on various things you could do with a functional fold . In the first post I mentioned that the idea came from a paper by Brian Beckman on Kalman filters and folds :
This post was inspired by a paper by Brian Beckman ( in progress ) that shows how a Kalman filter can be implemented as a fold . From a Bayesian perspective , the thing that makes the Kalman filter work is that a certain multivariate normal model has a conjugate prior . This post shows that conjugate models more generally can be implemented as folds over the data . That 's interesting , but what does it buy you ? Brian 's paper discusses this in detail , but one advantage is that it completely separates the accumulator function from the data , so the former can be tested in isolation .
At the time Brian was working on one big paper in private . This has since been split into several papers and they 're now public .

Who thought the day would come when Ron Paul 's campaign would bemoan too much media coverage ?
Ron Paul and their wife Carol were forced to abandon a breakfast campaign event this morning after the media circus became too much for the member of congress and patrons of a diner to handle .
More than 50 cameramen and 100 members of the media descended on Moe Joe 's Restaurant in Manchester , New Hampshire .
The member of congress slyly entered through the back door and attempted to shake hands with the breakfast crowd .
But when the cameras closed in , it became evident that moving inside the restaurant was impossible and Paul was quickly escorted out the back door .
Undaunted the cameras pushed out the door and surrounded Paul 's black SUV in the parking lot .
A woman who had waited for Paul in the restaurant pushed through the media hoard and very loudly and passionately pleaded for the member of congress to go back inside .
`` I 'll get the media to go away , '' the woman screamed .
But their pleas were drowned out by a man with a bull horn who proceeded to taunt Paul , calling them `` chicken '' playing the chicken dance song over their loud speaker .
The scene rendered Paul 's SUV immobile for about 5 minutes - until their security was forced to move everyone out of the way .
In a statement after the event , Paul 's campaign chairperson apologized to customers and asked reporters to tone it down .
`` While we are very welcoming of media coverage and grateful for the interest in Dr. Paul and their campaign , basic safety simply must come first . On behalf of Dr. Paul and their campaign team , I would like to apologize to customers at Moe Joe 's who may have been distressed by this incident , and extend our gratitude and apologies to the owners , who were kind enough to have us , '' said Benton . `` We ask the press , at all upcoming events over the next day and a half , to be respectful of both Dr. Paul and of New Hampshire voters , who are entitled to examine their candidates in a safe and responsible atmosphere . ''

atleast 87 % . You throw a bell , and it HIT HIM ! he 's paralyzed !
what do you do now ! ? alright here 's what you do .
( NOTE : this only works when you throw using the B button to throw )
okay first , you throw the Bell .
you RUN as fast as possible to your opponent
Okay , now you short-hop Forward-air . it damages your opponent
and if you did it right , you automatically caught the bell .
Now IMMEDIATELY footstool him . ( you might have to time it a little bit later on shorter opponents . ) it 's important to STAY CALM to prevent f * ck ups .
As soon as you jump in the air from the footstool ,
DIRECTLY throw the Bell downwards .
( this will stun your opponent who just fell , for a second time )
Fast-fall AS FAST AS POSSIBLE next to your opponent who 's still stunned .
NOW 'S YOUR CHANCE , HURRY !
FORWARD-SMASH ! ! ! ( it 's best to use your C-stick , or else you might accidentally do a Forward-Tilt .. )
Aaaaaand , he 's dead .
it is very important to focus while doing this .
it is quite rares for the bell to hit , it is might even catch you off-guard .
so think fast , and stay focused .
This is n't the most reliable combo out there . but it 's an AMAZING trump card .
Practise this in Training-Mode on a non-moving CPU at 87 %
tall , short , medium , heavy . TRY THEM ALL
then go on for glory and maybe , just maybe , when your Bell connects . you will definitely pull this off .
alright here 's the scenario.your oponent isas soon as the bell hits and your opponent is stunned ,
There have been incidents during the Hajj ' , the Muslim pilgrimage to the city of Mecca , that have caused loss of life . Every follower of Islam is required to visit Mecca during the Hajj at least once in their or their lifetime , if able to do so ; according to Islam , the pilgrimage is one of the Five Pillars of Islam . During the month of the Hajj , Mecca must cope with as many as three million pilgrims . [ 1 ]
Plane travel makes Mecca and the Hajj more accessible to pilgrims from all over the world . As a consequence , the Hajj has become increasingly crowded . City officials are required to control large crowds and provide food , shelter , sanitation , and emergency services for millions . However , it has not always been possible to prevent incidents .
Crushes and failures of crowd control [ edit ]
Sometimes the dense , surging troupes , trekking from one station of the pilgrimage to the next , cause a stampede , or more precisely , a progressive troupe collapse . At densities above 6 or 7 persons per square meter , individuals can not move , groups are swept along in waves , individuals jostle to find breath and to avoid falling and being trampled , and hundreds of deaths can occur as a result . The stoning of the devil ( ramƒ´ aj-jamarƒÅt ) ceremony is particularly crowded and dangerous . Pilgrims ritualistically throw pebbles at three walls ( formerly pillars ) which represent the three places where the Hadiths describe how the devil tempted Abraham . It is one of a series of ritual acts that must be performed in the Hajj .
Some notable incidents include :
Fires [ edit ]
December 1975 : An exploding gas cylinder caused a fire in a tent colony and resulted in the deaths of 200 pilgrims . [ 16 ]
April 15 , 1997 : 343 pilgrims were killed and 1,500 injured in a tent fire . [ 17 ] The tents are now fireproof .
The tents are now fireproof . February 13 , 2002 : Forty Haj pilgrims from the UAE died when the bus they were travelling in collided head on with a truck in Saudi Arabia 's Al Ihsa province . 37 Pakistanis , a Saudi , an Egyptian and a Syrian died .
November 1 , 2011 : Two pilgrims , a wife and husband , died in a coach fire . There were two coaches in the convoy , and a person in the second coach noticed smoke billowing from the coach in front . They radioed the driver to stop . Everybody evacuated the coach , and as the last two were getting out , the coach suffered three explosions .
Protests and violence [ edit ]
July 31 , 1987 : A clash between Iranian demonstrators and Saudi security forces led to the deaths of more than 400 pilgrims and thousands injured .
July 9 , 1989 : Two bombs exploded , killing one pilgrim and wounding another 16 . [ 18 ]
Airplane crashes [ edit ]
Disease [ edit ]
Mingling of visitors from many countries , some of which have poor health care systems still plagued by preventable infectious diseases , can lead to the spread of epidemics . If an outbreak were to occur on the road to Mecca , pilgrims could exacerbate the problem when they returned home and passed their infection on to others . This was more of a problem in the past . One such disease , which has prompted response from the Saudi government , is meningitis as it became a primary concern after an international outbreak following the Hajj in 1987 . Due to post-Hajj outbreaks globally of certain types of meningitis in previous years , it is now a visa requirement to be immunised with the ACW135Y vaccine before arrival . Every year , the Saudi government publishes a list of required vaccines for pilgrims , which for 2010 also included yellow fever , polio , and influenza . [ 19 ] [ 20 ]
Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus [ edit ]
As of 9 September 2013 , the Saudi government asked `` elderly and chronically ill Muslims to avoid the hajj this year '' and restricted the numbers of people allowed into the country due to the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus ( MERS-CoV ) . [ 21 ] [ 22 ] Although MERS-CoV was not detected among pilgrims , this does not rule out risk of the disease at Hajj . [ 23 ] The disease , though , is only mildly contagious .
Historical outbreaks [ edit ]
In 1905 the El Tor strain of cholera was discovered in six pilgrims returning from Hajj at the El-Tor quarantine camp in Egypt .
Construction failures [ edit ]
2006 Al Ghaza hotel collapse [ edit ]
A concrete multi-story building located in Mecca close to the Grand Mosque collapsed on January 5 , 2006 . The building , the Al-Ghaza Hotel , is said to have housed a restaurant , a convenience store , and a hotel . The hotel was reported to have been housing pilgrims to the 2006 Hajj . It is not clear how many pilgrims were in the hotel at the time of the collapse . As of the latest reports , the death toll was 76 and the number of injured was 64 . [ 24 ]
2015 crane collapse [ edit ]
A crane fell in the grand mosque on September 11 , 2015 , ten days before Hajj , causing 118 deaths and 394 injuries .
Other fatal events [ edit ]
Of the millions of pilgrims each year , many are elderly , and some die of their illnesses , exacerbated in some cases by the heat and exertion .
Before the beginning of the first day of the December 2006 Hajj , 243 pilgrims had died , according to a statement by the Saudi government . [ 25 ] The majority of deaths were reportedly related to heart problems , exhaustion in the elderly and people with weak health , caused by the heat and tiring physical work involved in the pilgrimage . After the conclusion of the Hajj , the Nigerian government reported that 33 nationals had died mostly `` as a result of hypertension , diabetes and heart attack '' , not due to epidemic illnesses , and rejected assertions that Nigerian pilgrims died in an accident on a road to Mina . [ 26 ] Egypt 's official news agency has reported that by December 30 ( 10 Dhu al-Hijjah ) , 22 Egyptian pilgrims had died . [ 27 ] Four elderly Filipino pilgrims in their 50s died during the pilgrimage of illnesses or other 'natural causes ' , and were buried in Mecca . [ 28 ] The Pakistani Hajj Medical Commission has announced that approximately 130 Pakistani pilgrims died during the Hajj season in Saudi Arabia , `` mostly aged and victims of pneumonia and heart patients '' , and that 66 pilgrims were admitted to Saudi hospitals for similar ailments .

The Pakistani Hajj Medical Commission has announced that approximately 130 Pakistani pilgrims died during the Hajj season in Saudi Arabia , `` mostly aged and victims of pneumonia and heart patients '' , and that 66 pilgrims were admitted to Saudi hospitals for similar ailments . In early December 2006 , a coach carrying pilgrims from holy sites in Medina to Mecca crashed 55 miles north of the port of Rabegh near Jeddah , killing 3 Britons and injuring 34 others , including two children . [ 29 ]
In November 2011 , thirteen Afghans died and a dozen others were wounded as a result of illness and traffic accidents . [ 30 ]
Pickpocketing [ edit ]
Of late , pickpocketing has created numerous problems for Hajj pilgrims . According to the Save Madina Foundation , 321 were victims of pickpocketing during Hajj in 2010 . [ 31 ]
Sexual abuse [ edit ]
Female pilgrims have spoken up about sexual abuse experienced on the Hajj through a movement called the Mosque Me Too movement . [ 32 ] [ 33 ] [ 34 ] Using the hashtag # MosqueMeToo , which stems from the Me Too movement which used the hashtag # MeToo , Muslim women have shared their experiences online about sexual abuse in Mecca . [ 35 ] [ 36 ] [ 37 ]
Official responses [ edit ]
The Saudi government has created a CCTV network to oversee security during the event .
Critics say that the Saudi government should have done more to prevent such tragedies . The Saudi government insists that any such mass gatherings are inherently dangerous and difficult to handle , and that they have taken a number of steps to prevent the problems . The fatalities in the largest tragedy in September 2015 are alleged to have been downplayed by the Saudis by as many as 1,700 . [ 15 ]
One of the biggest steps , which is also controversial , is a new system of registrations , passports , and travel visas to control the flow of pilgrims . This system is designed to encourage and accommodate first-time visitors to Mecca , while restricting repeat visits . Pilgrims who have the means and desire to perform the Hajj several times have protested what they see as discrimination , but the Hajj Commission has stated that they see no alternative if further tragedies are to be prevented .
Following the 2004 stampede , Saudi authorities embarked on major construction work in and around the Jamaraat Bridge area . Additional accessways , footbridges , and emergency exits were built , and the three cylindrical pillars were replaced with concrete walls to enable more pilgrims simultaneous access to them without the jostling and fighting for position of recent years . The government has also announced a multimillion-dollar project to expand the bridge to five levels ; the project is planned for completion in time for the 1427 AH ( Dec. 2006 ‚Äì Jan. 2007 ) Hajj . [ 38 ] Following the 2006 incident , the Jamaraat Bridge and the pillars representing Satan were demolished and reconstructed . A wider , multi-level bridge was built , and massive columns replaced the pillars themselves . Now , each level of the bridge allows easier and safer access to the columns representing Satan . In addition , the stoning ceremony must be carried out according to pre-determined schedules to prevent over-crowding and the attendant risks . The Jamaraat basin has been expanded from its current circular shape into an oval to allow better access to the pillars . The new arrangements provide for separate access and departure routes . [ 39 ] However , a security breakdown is mentioned as cause for the 2015 stampede . [ 40 ] A group of pilgrims who had cast their own stones and were returning to their camp , instead of taking the route designated for returning pilgrims , they took the route meant for those who were coming and crossed the other group of pilgrims heading straight to the jamaraat . [ 40 ] [ 41 ] [ 42 ]
American law is in a state of crisis .
The Internal Revenue Service , while stonewalling about its abuse of conservative political organizations , is hit with new charges that it willfully steals money from innocent small businesses .
Administrative law , which is supposed to control the temptations for abuse of power inherent in any bureaucracy , creates blank lettres de cachet for Federal agencies , and EPA , FDA , SEC , etc . have become tools of special interests or self-referential mobius strips rather than expert administrators .
Law schools focus on oppression studies while turning out debt-burdened graduates with poor job prospects .
An innocent teenager sits in jail for three years without trial because they refuse to bend to the system and plead guilty , while the DA denies all responsibility .
The Department of Justice withholds exculpatory evidence so as to swing a senatorial election ; fakes evidence against a timber company to extort millions of dollars in settlements ; forces banks to donate millions to private groups favored by the AG as the price of avoiding prosecution for following government policies on housing finance ; and fights all attempts to protect the honesty of elections .
Four ‚Äú progressive ‚Äù justices of the Supreme Court stand ready to rubber stamp any law or regulation that increases state power , and the vital freedoms of political free speech and the right to bear arms hang by a frayed thread , at the mercy of the next election .
Universities abandon all thought of disciplinary due process in sexual assault matters , under the prodding of a Department of Education seduced by radical feminists .
Forfeiture of assets in the absence of any evidence of a crime has become a method of self-financing by local law enforcement agencies , and various ‚Äú wars ‚Äù ‚Äì on drugs , on terror , on domestic violence , on child pornography ‚Äì have become all-purpose excuses for violations of civil liberties .
Tort law remains a lottery in which many get nothing and a few strikes is rich , and class actions generally produce little for the supposed plaintiffs while fulfilling the definition of a `` class action '' as the means by which a lawyer moves into the upper class .
These examples are a quick sampling of a tsunami of similar stories , and they all have two common themes . The first is that they involve government . One can find examples of legal dysfunction in the private sphere , but because government is where the power lies it is the vehicle of choice for the capture and distortion of the law .
The second theme is that the examples are intertwined with the capture of governmental power by special interests , both economic and ideological . According to The Godfather , ‚Äú One lawyer with a briefcase can steal more than a hundred men with guns ‚Äù , but if the lawyer has both a briefcase and control of the monopoly on violence called the state , the opportunities for plunder increase exponentially .
Perhaps the most disturbing part of the crisis is that revelation of the cascade of legal horrors does not lead to reform . The perpetrators are not sanctioned , or even embarrassed . Indeed , each revelation encourages even greater depredations , as the sociopaths of the system learn that they have not yet reached the bounds of possibility . ‚Äú Gee , you mean we can get away with that , too ? Let 's go ! ‚Äù
The territory of this blog is law and regulation , and it will comment on different aspects of the legal crisis , and perhaps suggest some cures .
The philosophy of this blog is straightforwardly conservative , which means what was once called ‚Äú common sense ‚Äù . It starts with the premise that a workable system of law is a pillar of any successful civilization . In particular , the law that developed in the Euro-American world , especially the English-speaking world , during the past millennium was and remains essential to the industrial and technological revolutions that have so expanded material wealth , and to the democratic/republican forms of government that have so enriched human autonomy and flourishing .
Digging into our economic and cultural history reinforces the basic principles once taught in law schools , about the importance of :
The rule of law , in the sense that the rules governing relationships among citizens are known , even-handed , predictable , and in accord with the values of the civilization , and in the sense that the government itself is bound by such rules .
A law of property that secures the fruits of labor ; a law of contracts that facilitates productive activity and allows people to control their own affairs and destinies ; a law of civil liability that discourages careless and callous conduct without turning into a lottery for the opportunistic ; a criminal code that eschews social engineering and economic rent-seeking , that treats clearing the innocent as important as convicting the guilty , and that avoids bootleggers-and-Baptists coalitions between lawbreakers and law enforcers ; and an administrative law that checks rather than enhances the temptations for abuse of power inherent in any bureaucracy .
A recognition that courts must be the guardians of republican democracy and the enforcers of the bargains made by citizens to protect our institutions from destruction by factions or even majorities pursuing short-term advantage . Legal rules , especially a constitution , are essential devices for Peter sober to protect themselves from Peter drunk .
Institutions dedicated to these principles , and to ensuring that law serves as grease , not glue , for the great wheels of civil society that run a civilization .
A mandarin class that is also devoted to these principles , and to making legal institutions work as they should .
Besides examining the legal crisis in the light of these concepts , the blog also has the purpose of highlighting the work of those who are fighting for reform . They are doing great and courageous work , though there are not enough of them , and too few are in the law schools .
My qualifications for blogging include many years spent in around the law . I am a magna cum laude graduate of Harvard Law School , where I was Book Review Editor of the Harvard Law Review . I served a term as an associate in Big Law ( O'Melveny & Myers in LA , back when 90 lawyers was big ) ; worked as a special assistant in the Department of Housing and Urban Development , as an analyst in the Program Evaluation Office of the U.S. Bureau of the Budget , as an Assistant Director in the Bureau of Consumer Protection in the Federal Trade Commission , and as Research Director of the Administrative Conference of the United States . I spent some years as an independent consultant on energy and environmental issues , and worked with several free-market think tanks , including the Competitive Enterprise Institute , the Progress & Freedom Foundation , the National Legal Center for the Public Interest , the Digital Society , and the Convergence Law Institute . I have written books on property rights and on the special interest state , and numerous articles and monographs on energy/environmental issues , administrative law , property rights , intellectual property , and related topics . I have also blogged extensively for PFF and for Digital Society , primarily on intellectual property and telecom .
This career history may be a tad unconventional , but I like to think it has given me some unusual perspectives on current problems , and a certain realism about the state of the legal world .

For too long comic characters built the framework of their success on the pretense of ‚Äú badass ‚Äù . The 90 's boom of Liefeld-inspired artwork that flaunted jacked-up ‚Äú heroes ‚Äù sporting an entire arsenal on their persons became somehow a norm for character designs . Not across the board , but enough so to recognize it as a trend of the era .
Thankfully we 're in the midst of a second coming , of sorts , that is culturing , and elevating the medium to one that praises style over empty assertions of practicality . As a whole we are collectively growing and modernizing , and thus expecting our interests to grow as well . In the same way that fashion is cyclical we are seeing more and more comics that are producing unique , creative ideas that use less to convey more . Characters that we consider familiar are undergoing transformations that redefine and update the sensibilities , interactions and sophistication of tired tropes .
In the Marvel Universe some of the most notorious ‚Äú bad asses ‚Äù are losing their edge in favor of a fresher approach , resulting in immense acclaim from both critics and readers alike . Last year Mark Waid took Daredevil , a character who has been stewing in angst for the past 20 years and gave them an entirely new outlook , producing easily one of the most engaging and clever series of our time . By giving Matt Murdock a chance at joy again , Waid took away what many considered a defining feature of the character .
This could only succeed with purpose and follow through , which thankfully we 've gotten out of each and every issue . This reboot has succeeded at many things , most notably is the art that gives readers a chance to see , hear , and feel how our protagonist experiences situations . All of this has come together in an aesthetic culmination that is at the forefront of this stylistic transition .
Most recently , Matt Fraction and David Aja proved the merits of an all too questionable character , by giving them a lead in the most stylish book of the year . Hawkeye succeeds in a similar way that Daredevil does , in that they show the vision of a character we are all familiar with , in a way that we have never seen before . Everything from the dialogue to transitions are played with to create a wholly unique experience that is unmistakably Hawkeye . While the mundane is reimagined , the action pages extend into 15 panel explosions of motion , focal points and stylized violence . The covers alone are enough to make even the most hardened readers swoon .
Jason Aaron showed us that even the most grizzled characters are capable of revitalizing and finding new voices with their Wolverine and the X-Men run , which has been fun and quirky . Two words you 'd never expect given Wolverine 's typical blood-soaked , rough-around-the-edges characterization . By taking away what we all know about the popular character , Aaron has taken away a crutch that has kept Wolverine locked in a stagnant , perpetual ‚Äú cool ‚Äù that never allowed for growth . It 's been long overdue but handled in a genuinely smart way that has built on top of a recognized foundation , instead of from the ground up , showing actual growth , not just a retry .
While they were never really a jerk , or a one a dimensional bore , Captain Marvel ‚Äò s recent redesign additionally reflects a coming of age in the comics community . Remember 2 years ago when everyone lost it over Wonder Woman ‚Äò s pants ? Well luckily Jamie McKelvie ‚Äò s Captain Marvel redesign for Kelly Sue DeConnick ‚Äò s series has been received with open arms , thanks in no small part to just how cool it is . Some may say that she 's a smaller market character , and therefore fewer people are around to kick up dirt , but really , it 's the style and aesthetic that is cementing itself within the medium .
Across the industry pond , DC has found huge success with both Scott Snyder 's Batman and Jeff Lemire 's Animal Man . Now the argument has been made that Batman does so well ‚Äú because it 's Batman ‚Äù , suggesting that no matter who was writing it , the book would be doing well as Batman is such a beloved character . Well that would be one of the most colossally ignorant oversights of what it is about this series that makes it so appealing .
Aesthetically speaking this series has managed to mold the traditional ‚Äú cool ‚Äù with updated attraction . While the Court of Owls was the epitome of creepy , we briefly got a glimpse of how artist Greg Capullo viewed Batman 's infamous rouges . Even though they were all in their prison scrubs they oozed style , which makes the art that much more captivating . When a Supervillain looks like he 's dressed by Don Draper that 's when you know they mean business . I know we have n't seen many of these villains in full costume yet , but having seen the sharp style that is carried throughout Gotham City , you can bet when we get to them , they 'll be dressed to kill . But , as I mentioned this is necessary to fit into a city that is as chic , and deranged as Gotham .
Though they may not be dressed as sharp , the characters that fill the pages of Animal Man are surrounded by artistic genius that is overwhelmingly gorgeous . The detail that has gone into each issue by artists Travel Foreman , and Steve Pugh have gone a similar route as Daredevil , and presented the powers of Animal Man in a visceral way that is incredibly organic .
Bloody veins protrude from Buddy Baker in a way that may be unsettling , but are no less stylish . While this style may be more densely packed than the simplicity of Hawkeye , or Daredevil it shows us the range this transition has affected . It 's not just simple that has become praised , it is the embodiment of ideas that we are becoming more aware of , and more receptive to .
There is no formula for success here , rather a pursuit of individuality that demonstrates research coupled with vision .
While the mainstream is continually evolving , and chewing off the fat , fans and artists are taking style and ideas into their own hands and making sites like Deviantart.com top-tier sources for creative expression . Artists like Denis Medri are continually updating and reinventing characters that break them free from their confinements and allow for creativity through the viewers , as many of these ideas will probably never be utilized .
The innovation and artistry has not been lost here as some redesigns have found cult success .
Like this now infamous Rockabilly Batman .
The same can be said for Mondo , a design company who ca n't hold onto a new poster print for more than 3 minutes before selling out .
There have been many factors that have influenced this change in aesthetic , but essentially it boils down to a growing culture . Increasing interest in style can be seen throughout our culture and it was only a matter of time until it caught up to comics . Thankfully it seems that this transition is growing steadily as more and more books are embracing the cultivation of refinement . Hell , maybe sometime soon Superhero halloween costumes will come with custom tailoring instead of built-in muscles .
CHICAGO ‚Äì Che ‚Äú Rhymefest ‚Äù Smith , a 33-year-old Hip-hop artist and third generation resident of the southside 's Woodlawn neighborhood , announced Oct. 22 , that they will run for alderman of the 20th Ward .
Smith , best known for co-writing the Grammy-winning song ‚Äú Jesus Walks ‚Äù with their friend Kanye West , said they hope to lead a renaissance in their community , a ward that 's filled with empty lots , boarded-up businesses and is plagued by unemployment and youth violence .
Smith aims to tackle poverty and disenfranchisement . Speaking to the press they said their vision for the community they grew up is one that involves residents , a community in which youth would find productive ways to fill their time , elders would be sought out for wisdom and small business owners would be able to expand .
Smith aims to use Hip-hop as a way to support their message and engage young people to get active . They plan to reach out to fellow Chicagoans and Hip-hop artists Kanye West and Common to support their campaign .
They said he 's always been an activist and has traveled the world promoting development in various communities addressing issues of injustice . ‚Äú But every time I came back home it was blaring in my face . The biggest injustice that I was facing was right where I lived . ‚Äù
Speaking to NBC news Smith said , ‚Äú My children want to play at the park in a safe community and it 's time to take personal responsibility , music aside , to help re-engage the community . ‚Äù
Smith said the 20th Ward lacks development , infrastructure and training programs for residents . They note the University of Chicago is an important asset in the area that should be taken advantage of . ‚Äú What we need to do is figure out how to bring people from the ivory towers to the small towns and people from the small towns to the ivory towers , ‚Äù they said .
They spoke of the need for a community council that includes seniors , block clubs and neighborhood association leaders that will collectively impact on decisions on behalf of the ward . Those decisions need to be made by the consensus of the community , not by one person , they said . ‚Äú We need to give this ward back to the community and I believe that everything powerful ‚Äì everything that connects ‚Äì is local , ‚Äù they said . ‚Äú We need to re-engage the local youth and community residents and that 's what I want to do . Every thing else comes second . ‚Äù
The 20 Ward includes the Englewood , Back of the Yards and Woodlawn neighborhoods and is predominantly African American . Smith will be running against Ald . Willie Cochran , 58 , a former police officer who also owns a laundromat in the area .
Cochran won a landslide victory over scandal-plagued veteran Ald . Arenda Troutman in 2007 with the backing from some of Mayor Richard M. Daley 's most prominent Black allies .
Cochran credits their first term with building a new grocery store and an Autozone store in the ward . And they say he 's helped to improve schools , rebuild infrastructure , created youth programs , a jobs program for ex-offenders and new housing . Cochran 's also working to bring a new Wal-Mart store to the ward , despite many in Chicago that disapprove of the big-box company 's notorious low wages and anti-union policies .
Cochran says he 's not threatened by Smith 's bid to replace them and had this to say about Smith in an interview published in the Chicago News Cooperative :
‚Äú You have an intelligent voting public , and if they want to replace an educated public administrator with a rapper who refers to women as hos and bitches in their videos , who uses their performances to promote the use of weapons and gang activity , then the voting public has changed a lot , ‚Äù
But far from being a ‚Äú gangsta ‚Äù rapper , Smith is actually known as a conscious Hip-hop artist . Smith is known for addressing social issues in their lyrics that feature real stories and daily struggles about working people . They note their aldermanic race is a serious campaign to improve the quality of life for residents of the ward . They said businesses in the area ‚Äú do n't need to just survive , they need to thrive . ‚Äù
Che ‚Äú Rhymefest ‚Äù Smith was named after Che Guevara , the Argentine medical doctor turned revolutionary that helped ignite Cuba 's socialist revolution alongside Fidel Castro in 1959 . Speaking to the press Smith said , ‚Äú The definition of revolution is love . ‚Äù
‚Äú This is the ward that we are going to take back for the people who live here , ‚Äù said Smith . ‚Äú We are the 20th Ward , and we will reclaim our greatness . ‚Äù

GRAND RAPIDS , Mich. ‚Äì Michigan State Attorney General and GOP candidate for governor Mike Cox does n't want Michigan residents to have universal access to health care . That 's why they are joining with several other judicial activist Republican attorneys general to try to block President Obama 's just-passed healthcare overhaul .
Apparently acting on behalf of the insurance industry and putting their personal ambitions above the needs of the state , Mike Cox wants to block Michigan residents from important consumer protections that will go into effect this year . For example , prohibitions on denial of coverage to children with preexisting conditions will take effect this year . In addition , parents will be able to keep their children on their insurance policies until eh age of 26 .
Cox does n't want Michigan residents to have a chance to choose the same sort of health care coverage members of Congress now get under the Federal Employee Health Benefits program . Best to leave those taxpayer-funded , government-run programs for the benefit of politicians , apparently .
Over the next couple of years , the President 's health reform law will also prevent insurance companies from denying coverage to people with chronic medical problems or charging them higher prices ‚Äì a reform Mike Cox is trying to kill .
Mike Cox also seems anxious to overturn provisions in the law that would eliminate insurance company discrimination against women .
Cox 's action seeks to block provisions in the law that will make health insurance more affordable for working families . The new law will provide subsidies to poor and middle-class families to ensure they have access to health coverage .
President Obama 's health reform law also will provide subsidies for financially strapped small businesses so they can provide health benefits for themselves and their employees . Why would Mike Cox work so hard to block this ?
Cox also seems to want to deny seniors new provisions in the health reform law that will close the so-called ‚Äú doughnut hole ‚Äù in prescription drug coverage .
Cox 's anti-health reform politics might play well with a loud and rude minority in their Party , but they do not reflect the majority views of the country or the people of Michigan . Cox seems anxious to associate themselves with the Tea Party people who gathered at the Capitol last Sunday to hurl racist epithets at African American members of Congress ( http : //www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/03/20/tea-party-protests-nier-f_n_507116.html ) and have consistently attacked the President personally , and not just for their policies .
Michigan residents do n't want their Attorney General to waste their tax dollars on their personal agenda . They do n't want to be the state that stood in the way of historic legislation that launched the first steps toward universal health care .
Malaysia is set to repeal legislation that imposes a mandatory death penalty for people who sell drugs , despite most of its neighbouring countries implementing increasingly brutal drug policies .
On August 8 , Minister Azalina Othman Said tweeted to corroborate a story in the press : Malaysia 's cabinet had `` agreed to amend the colonial-era Dangerous Drugs Act of 1952 to give courts a choice in sentencing '' . Under current legislation , anyone found guilty of trafficking drugs faces a mandatory death penalty ; the planned reform would give judges discretion in sentencing . While the proposed amendment has support from the cabinet , it must first be tabled in the parliament , which is expected to pass it in October , The Australian reports .
As TalkingDrugs reported in 2016 , Malaysia seems to have placed a ‚Äú secret moratorium ‚Äù on the execution of people for drug offences for several years . Despite executing 229 people for drug offences between 1983 and 2013 , Malaysia is not believed to have executed anyone for such an offence since then . Numerous people have , however , been sentenced to death for drug trafficking , but the executions have not taken place .
Malaysia also seems to be moving in a gradual progressive direction in relation to drug use . The country 's Ministry of Health has received acclaim from international non-profits , including Harm Reduction International , for its strong and successful policies that reduce the harms of drug use , including needle syringe programmes ( NSPs ) and methadone maintenance therapy . However , Malaysia is by no means a bastion of evidence-based drug policy , as it continues to force some people into compulsory ‚Äú rehabilitation ‚Äù centres , which a recent study suggests may increase the risk of relapse when compared to voluntary methadone treatment .
Regardless , Malaysia 's gradual shift away from executions marks a sharp contrast with many of its neighbouring countries in the Southeast Asia region .
Across the Straits of Johor , to the south of the Malaysian Peninsular , is Singapore , which was estimated in 2004 to have the highest per capita execution rate in the world . While the city state may no longer hold this grisly title , it continues to execute people for relatively low-level drug offences with considerable regularity and highly questionable judicial standards . Most recently , on July 14 , the Singaporean state executed a Malaysian man who was given a mandatory death sentence after heroin was found in a car that they had borrowed . Such punitive measures are part of the country 's approach to drugs , which it calls `` harm prevention '' ; a senior minister recently described this as including ‚Äú tough , swift , and uncompromising‚Ä¶ robust [ law ] enforcement ‚Äù to prevent the distribution or use of drugs .
A few miles from the Malaysian capital Kuala Lumpur , across the Malacca Strait , is Indonesia , where the government has been waging an increasingly vicious war on people involved with drugs in recent years . Within four months of the inauguration of President Joko Widodo in October 2014 , the government had executed 14 people for drug offences . As TalkingDrugs has reported , the country 's approach has taken a significantly more draconian turn : in July 2017 , Widodo told police to commit extrajudicial killings of foreigners if they are alleged to have sold drugs and resist arrest . The country 's national police chief justified the approach by asserting that ‚Äú when we shoot drug dealers , they go away ‚Äù .

The Philippines , with which Malaysia shares a maritime border in the South China Sea , is currently implementing some of the most repressive drug legislation in the world . As TalkingDrugs has extensively reported on , President Rodrigo Duterte has presided over a drug war slaughter that has led to the deaths of an estimated 9,000 people since July 2016 . In one of the more recent harrowing developments , Duterte called for the introduction of the death penalty in the Philippines for a range of offences ‚Äì including drug possession .
Malaysia has perhaps only one neighbouring country with a relatively less punitive drug war : Thailand . Thailand 's Ministry of Justice launched a comprehensive nationwide harm reduction programme in January 2017 , including methadone provisions and counselling , as well as job training to prepare people with problematic drug use for entering the work force . While Thailand does technically allow the death penalty for drug offences , it has not executed anyone under this law ( or for any offence ) since 2009 .
If countries in the Southeast Asia region continue in their current trajectory , more successful harm reduction measures , and relatively less harsh punishments for trafficking offences , may be implemented in Malaysia and Thailand . Conversely , the near future seems increasingly harrowing for Singapore , Indonesia , and the Philippines .
Audit Report : Billions of Yen Wasted on Bad Technology at Fukushima
March 24 , 2015 /
by Mari Yamaguchi / AP /
Japanese government auditors say the operator of the Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear plant has wasted more than a third of the 190 billion yen ( $ 1.6 billion ) in taxpayer money allocated for cleaning up the plant after it was destroyed by a March 2011 earthquake and tsunami .
A Board of Audit report describes various expensive machines and untested measures that ended in failure . It also says the cleanup work has been dominated by one group of Japanese utility , construction and electronics giants despite repeated calls for more transparency and greater access for international bidders .
Tokyo Electric Power Co. spokesperson Teruaki Kobayashi said all of the equipment contributed to stabilizing the plant , even though some operated only briefly .
Some of the failures cited in the report :
FRENCH IMPORT : Among the costliest failures was a 32 billion yen ( $ 270 million ) machine made by French nuclear giant Areva SA to remove radioactive cesium from water leaking from the three wrecked reactors . The trouble-plagued machine lasted just three months and treated only 77,000 tons of water , a tiny fraction of the volume leaking every day . It has since been replaced with Japanese and American machines .
SALT REMOVAL : Seawater was used early in the crisis to cool the reactors after the normal cooling systems failed . Machines costing 18.4 billion yen ( $ 150 million ) from several companies including Hitachi GE Nuclear Energy , Toshiba Corp. and Areva were supposed to remove the salt from the contaminated water at the plant . One of the machines functioned only five days , and the longest lasted just six weeks .
SHODDY TANKS : TEPCO hurriedly built dozens of storage tanks for the contaminated water at a cost of 16 billion yen ( $ 134 million ) . The shoddy tanks , using rubber seals and assembled by unskilled workers , began leaking and some water seeped into the ground and then into the ocean . The tanks are now being replaced with more durable welded ones .
GIANT UNDERGROUND POOLS : A total of 2.1 billion yen ( $ 18 million ) was spent on seven huge underground pools built by Maeda Corp. to store the contaminated water . They leaked within weeks , and the water had to be transferred to steel tanks .
UNFROZEN TRENCH : A 100 million yen ( $ 840,000 ) project to contain highly contaminated water in a maintenance tunnel by freezing it failed because the water never completely froze . TEPCO subsidiary Tokyo Power Technology even threw in chunks of ice , but eventually had to pour in cement to seal the trench .

Alone brings supernatural meta horror to Oculus Rift VR Oculus Rift VR has shown potential for true horror and Greenwood Games is hoping to capture that with their upcoming supernatural game within a game , Alone .
Oculus Rift seems ideally suited for horror , as evidenced by our recent eyes-on at IndieCade . Developer Greenwood Games ( consisting of industry veterans from Vicarious Visions and Ironclad Games ) is also taking a stab with a new psychological horror game called Alone .
Alone puts players in a virtual living room and goes completely meta by having them play through a virtual FPS horror on their TV . The FPS , called The Witching Hour , slowly begins to come to life , enveloping the living room and bringing its 19th century supernatural atmosphere directly to your face .
The game 's prototype runs 10 minutes and is available to download from Greenwood 's website , for anyone that owns an Oculus Rift VR dev kit . The developer is shooting for an episode-length 30-45 minute finalized version for early 2014 . It 's set to come to PC , Mac , and Linux . For more , check out the game 's Kickstarter page .
Mosquitos are essentially taking our drugs for their benefit . Photo : Salvatore D'Oro/Flickr
Antibiotic therapy is the closest medical science has ever come to having a magic bullet . People generally do n't die of scarlet fever or lose limbs to staph anymore , and getting syphilis today is embarrassing but unlikely to erode your skull .
But new research from a group at Imperial College London shows that we might not be the only ones benefiting from antibiotic prescriptions . The researchers found that mosquitos feeding on the blood of malaria patients taking antibiotics were healthier , lived longer , and were likely more effective at spreading malaria than those feeding on unmedicated hosts .
The mosquitos‚ÄîAnopheles gambiae‚Äîwere essentially taking our drugs for their benefit .
The paper , published this week in Nature Communications , detailed further unintended consequences of antibiotic use , and suggests that many global health initiatives may be facing a new , complicating factor in their battle against infectious diseases in areas also affected by malaria .
Over-prescription and improper use of antibiotics has already been blamed for creating so-called `` superbugs '' ‚Äîhighly drug resistant bacteria that affect millions worldwide . Scientists are also just beginning to understand the importance of the human microbiome , the countless bacteria that colonize our bodies to our benefit . Indiscriminately killing bacteria with antibiotics can clear out these beneficial organisms and may have serious consequences .
`` A new thing we had n't planned on was that [ the mosquitos ] were healthier on the antibiotics . They survived better , lived longer , and laid more eggs , '' said Dr. Gendrin
The key to the hyper-malarial mosquitos described in the study lies in their guts . Just as the human gut is home to a diverse array of helpful native bacteria‚Äîas demonstrated by icky but effective fecal transplant therapy‚Äîmosquitos have their own beneficial bowel dwellers that protect them from infection .
When a typical mosquito ingests a blood meal containing Plasmodium falciparum‚Äîthe parasite responsible for malaria‚Äîits native microbes compete with the parasite for resources while emitting free radicals that are toxic to P. falciparum too . But while the parasite is weakened by the native bacteria , the group theorized that stripping the mosquitos of their native bacterial populations would allow P. falciparum to take over . The resulting mosquitos would carry more of the parasite than normal , increasing infectivity .
`` We knew that without a gut microbiota the mosquitos had a higher rate of Plasmodium infection , '' said Dr. Mathilde Gendrin , lead author of the paper . `` We decided to look at blood containing antibiotics . That is , if someone takes an antibiotic treatment , what is the effect on malaria ? ''
The scientists fed mosquitos blood containing penicillin and streptomycin , antibiotics in common use . They observed a 70 percent decrease in the native microbiota and a significant increase in both the number of mosquitos carrying P. falciparum , and the total amount of the parasite in infected mosquitos .
With the native bacteria depleted by antibiotics , P. falciparum began to reproduce unchecked . The researchers confirmed their initial laboratory observations using blood donated by malarial patients in Burkina Faso , and the effect was the same . The incidence and intensity of P. falciparum infection spiked when there were antibiotics in the blood .
The group had proved their hypothesis correct , but the mosquitos were benefitting in other ways , too . `` A new thing we had n't planned on was that [ the mosquitos ] were healthier on the antibiotics . They survived better , lived longer , and laid more eggs , '' said Dr. Gendrin , noting that the effect was independent of P. falciparum .
The scientists believe it is possible that after a blood rich meal the mosquito gut microbiota surge in number due to the abundant nutrients , provoking a low level immune response and weakening the mosquito . In other words , the native bacteria become too much of a good thing . This effect no longer happens in mosquitos who have ingested antibiotics .
Whatever the reason , as Dr. Gendrin notes in the paper , anything that increases mosquito 's survival rate increases their ability to spread disease . That malaria patients on antibiotics may aid the spread of the parasite adds a further wrinkle to the already hugely complex task of combating diseases in the equatorial regions where malaria is prevalent .
The paper notes that epidemiological studies will be needed to confirm that the effect they see on the individual level holds true for entire populations . But if the results bear out , entire global health strategies may need to be re-thought .
One of the antibiotics used in the study , streptomycin , is also used against tuberculosis which is by most accounts the most prevalent infection in the world . The Mycobacterium responsible for the disease is notoriously resilient and slow growing , with antibiotic treatment courses lasting from six months to years in some cases .
Add to this leprosy ( also a Mycobacteria ) , antibiotic prescriptions for the large portions of sub-saharan African residents dealing with HIV/AIDS related infections , and a whole host of so-called `` neglected tropical diseases '' with various active initiatives to eradicate them via antibiotic therapy , and the picture starts to look bleak .
However , despite the outcome of the study , Dr. Gendrin insisted that no-one is suggesting abandoning the use of antibiotics in malaria affected areas . `` It 's more complicated . When we are designing large drug administration programs we need to know which drugs may increase malaria transmission and direct patients on antibiotics according to risks , '' they said , noting that they are working on additional antibiotics that restrict the malaria parasite directly .
The solution may be as simple as different drugs . P. falciparum is a microscopic parasite , but it 's not a bacterium , and it avoids being killed by many antibiotics that target bacteria specifically . There are compounds that are active against organisms like P. falciparum , and there may be antibiotics that work against their intended disease targets without enhancing malaria infection in mosquitos .
As it stands this research has revealed a potentially serious issue with the way antibiotic drugs are prescribed and used in areas of the world where malaria is endemic . When the first antibiotics went into mass production in the mid twentieth century the response in the western world was jubilant ; medicine had conquered bacterial infection . The city of Madrid even built a statue featuring a bronze matador raising their cap to Sir Alexander Fleming , thanking them for discovering penicillin and saving their beloved bullfighters from long and painful post-goring deaths by sepsis .
Antibiotics are still rightly seen as a triumph today . But nature likes to remind us that nothing is simple‚Äîthe interplay between parasites , hosts , medicines , and disease is incredibly complex , and our magic bullets are n't as precise or accurate as we once thought .
The Department of the Taoiseach incurred costs of more than ‚Ç¨22,000 for the use of VIP facilities at Dublin Airport by former and current office holders in the second half of last year .
Former president Mary Robinson , European research commissioner Maire Geoghegan Quinn and former taoiseach Bertie Ahern are the three people identified as having used the service in records released to The Irish Times under the Freedom of Information Act .
Ms Robinson , recently appointed UN special envoy for the Great Lakes region , was the most frequent user of the VIP service , with the department being billed for use of the facilities by them on 56 occasions during the period at a cost of some ‚Ç¨12,985 .
As a former president they are entitled to use the service . A spokesperson said : ‚Äú Mary Robinson did use the executive facilities at Dublin Airport in the manner that has been outlined . As has been acknowledged , Mrs Robinson was entitled to use these facilities , as a former holder of office in Ireland . ‚Äù
Ms Geoghegan Quinn , who works out of Brussels , used the service on 22 occasions during the period at a cost of some ‚Ç¨5,654 . A spokesperson replied ‚Äú no comment ‚Äù when asked about their use of the facilities .
In the second half of last year , the department paid for the use of VIP facilities by Mr Ahern on eight occasions at a cost of ‚Ç¨2,186 .
The costs relating to Mr Ahern all occurred in 2011 but were only paid in the second half of 2012 . The department no longer pays for VIP services for former taoisigh , having ceased the practice at the end of 2011 .
According to the Dublin Airport Authority website , the VIP service is a ‚Äú premier service , even if you 're flying economy ‚Äù .
On arrival to Dublin , the website says , ‚Äú we 'll be at your aircraft waiting to drive you to our VIP suite . We 'll assist you with the formalities of immigration and customs as quickly as possible and help with retrieving your baggage . It 's the perfect end to a busy trip or holiday . ‚Äù
VIP airport costs related to the British-Irish Summit amounted to‚Ç¨3,400 and the use of VIP services by unspecified persons cost a further ‚Ç¨1,800 during the second half of 2012 .
Catering costs
The records also show that the average cost of catering for a Cabinet meeting during the period was less than ‚Ç¨20 , with Spar of Merrion Row among the suppliers .
The cost of catering for the National Day of Commemoration at Collins Barracks in July was considerably more expensive , with Brambles Deli Caf√© Ltd receiving some ‚Ç¨21,800 for their services .
The department spent some ‚Ç¨10,500 on televisions and brackets in the period and more than ‚Ç¨1,700 on cufflinks .
Captain Ginyu : A Set Too Soon
Now that we have our first official CRD and the threat of the Namekian Style has died down , a new scourge has emerged on the tournament scene ( not that they were ever absent from it ) : CAPTAIN GINYU ! OH NOESS !
The evil captain has certainly made a splash , and there 's already talk by some to bust them down to lieutenant and take out some of their steam , but does Captain Ginyu need a nerf ? Like I pointed out was the problem with the Namekian style , they certainly are consistent for what they do and I would even go as far to say they are the most consistent personality in the crucial early turns . So like the Namekian style , same malady means it needs the same medicine ( a nerf ) , right ? Well , not so fast‚Ä¶
The problem with the Namekian style lay in the overall design of the style , whether that means the designers were overcompensating for something with the Namekian style or the other styles just were n't given enough power remains up to debate . The problem with Captain Ginyu is that they exist in an environment that just does not have the tools necessary to keep them in check .
Captain Ginyu is a Set Three personality released in Set One . And again , we can get a good picture as to why Captain Ginyu seems to be the personality to beat by analyzing what 's in the set .
Again , consistency is the name of the game and Captain Ginyu can hit the ground running on turn one by getting a guaranteed ally out with their power every time ( short of you getting a miracle blitz and taking away their power stages before they can use their power ) . On the other side of the fence , what are your options for getting rid of allies ?
Right off the bat we know that there are Critical Effects that can take care of allies . Just about any attack is capable of getting one , but I 'm just gon na come out and say that it 's an unreliable method for ally control . It 's basically a conditional HIT effect , and it really becomes irrelevant by the time Captain Ginyu reaches Level 2 and can fish allies out of the discard pile and completely useless once Captain Ginyu reaches Level 3+ and is immune to losing allies via Critical Effects .
So we have to start looking at cards that either Banish or Destroy allies to make a dent in the Captain Ginyu ally machine . Out of the six styles , only three of them have cards that can outright Banish an ally : Blue Betrayal , Orange Stare Down and Red Energy Blast . If you include cards that can Destroy allies , then the Saiyan style can count the conditional Saiyan Surprise in its arsenal while the Red style gets two more cards with conditional/situational Destroy effects : Red Lightning Slash and Red Observation ( which is limit one per deck ) .
Unless you want to count Yamcha ‚Äì Action Ready , the Black and Namekian styles have no way to combat Captain Ginyu 's powers ( though in most cases they only have one less anti-ally card than every other style ) .
But here 's the thing about the situation and why I believe that overall Captain Ginyu is n't broken : there is almost certainly going to be more cards that can Banish or Destroy allies introduced in later sets . Right now , some styles ca n't run any ( non-Critical Effect ) anti-ally cards while others can run a max of three and the Red style can get all the way up to seven tech cards . Introducing at least one Freestyle card that can Banish/Destroy an ally plus another styled one means that some decks could have close to 10 % of their cards being ally tech , should the meta environment demand it .
It 's just a shame that the meta currently does not have the infrastructure to combat a consistent ally deck like Captain Ginyu . Their powers would be perfectly fine ( and maybe even on the average side ) if they were released in Set Three where we can assume that there would be more card effects that were anti-ally available to all styles . Unfortunately in Set One , Captain Ginyu has few ( if any ) natural predators . I 'm not saying he 's unbeatable , they just has every advantage going for him .
Is Captain Ginyu broken ? No . Does Captain Ginyu need errata ? No . What they need is a bigger card pool to find their balanced place in the meta .

If you 're already using iOS 8 's iCloud Drive feature , you might want to avoid your iPhone 's `` Reset '' menu . MacRumors reports that a newly discovered bug causes iCloud Drive documents to be permanently erased from the cloud whenever a a user picks `` Reset All Settings . '' Ordinarily this option would simply do what it says ; the iPhone 's settings and preferences are immediately reset to their original factory defaults . No media ( music , photos , etc . ) or documents are supposed to be erased or otherwise affected when performing this action ‚Äî that should only happen if you choose `` Erase All Content and Settings '' and wipe your phone entirely .
But something 's clearly not right , with MacRumors reporting that documents stored in iCloud Drive are disappearing from Apple 's iWork apps upon reset . They 're also vanishing from OS X Yosemite , which will bring iCloud Drive to Mac users later this fall . Right now , it 's iOS users along with Yosemite developers and beta testers reporting the problem . iCloud Drive is also available on Windows , but it 's unclear if the issue has popped up there . It 's also not yet obvious how widespread the bug is or whether it affects everyone that has transitioned to iCloud Drive .
In our own testing , using `` Reset All Settings '' deleted all iWork documents stored in iCloud Drive on the iPhone and on iCloud.com . After allowing time for syncing to a Mac running OS X Yosemite , all of the documents disappeared from that machine as well . Preview and TextEdit documents , which can not be accessed on the iPhone , remained untouched on the Mac .
There 's no easy way of recovering documents deleted from iCloud . Apple added a `` recently deleted '' folder to Photos in iOS 8 , but has n't yet implemented a similar option for all of iCloud . MacRumors notes the issue `` may be limited to Apple 's own iWork apps like Pages , Keynote , and Numbers '' and iCloud Drive files from other third-party apps could be safe from the bug . But for now , the best option is avoiding `` Reset All Settings '' entirely until a fix is in place . We 've reached out to Apple for clarification on just what 's going on .
How You Can Eat Fresh & Local Wherever You Are
Nastasha joins us as a guest blogger , sharing their journey towards everyday sustainable eating . Making changes to your daily eating habits while making a socially-conscious impact with your purchase can be a big task - but we find that learning from others is the best way to start !
It 's a crisp evening in September and I 'm standing on a rooftop in downtown Toronto , while volunteers water 108 plant boxes filled with tomatoes , cucumbers , kale , and basil - everything I want in a late summer salad right about now .
‚Äú Some plants just go bonanza up here , ‚Äù says Jen Broadbent , a coordinator with Cultivate Toronto , an organization that connects communities with local food through urban agriculture . They supply produce for the Regent Park Farmer 's Market , grown primarily on a rooftop farm filled with plastic ‚Äú earth boxes ‚Äù - basically , large bins that allow plants to thrive in spaces otherwise unsuitable for any kind of gardening .
Directly facing a growing block of new condominium towers , this summer must have been a scorcher for the farm 's crops . Up here , there 's no reprieve from the glaring sun . ‚Äú Certain types of plants love it , other plants‚Ä¶love it less , ‚Äù Jen ventures with a chuckle .
At the tail end of winter - sometime in late March to early April - volunteers bring seedlings out to the rooftop for planting . ‚Äú Right at the beginning , prepping the ( earth ) boxes is a huge amount of work , ‚Äù says Jen . ‚Äú You always underestimate it ! ‚Äù
‚Äú Our volunteers come mainly to water , harvest and do maintenance , ‚Äù they explain ; these tasks include spraying kale and chard with neem oil ( a natural pest deterrent ) , putting in stakes for tomatoes , and pulling up squashes with nibble marks from neighbourhood squirrels . ‚Äú They really love butternut , ‚Äù Jen sighs , ‚Äú but we just learn how to live with them . ‚Äù
`` A medley of produce at their peak - grown on a rooftop in the city ‚Äù .

Prime harvesting season kicks in just before the farmers market starts in June . This year , the farm produced :
six varieties of tomatoes , including beefsteak , yellow pear , black cherry and yellow zebra
tomatillos
cucumbers ( a great vegetable to farm vertically , as they provide shade for other plants )
eggplants , including globe and Japanese varieties
okra ( whose stalks grow to over five feet in one season )
globe ( purple ) and regular basil
yellow and green beans
Swiss chard
several varieties of kale , including curly , black , red and green
cabbages
radishes
parsley
leeks
onions
sage
lemon and regular thyme
lemon balm
tarragon
chocolate and regular mint
hot peppers , including banana , poblano and finger chilli varieties ( ‚Äú I have traffic red jars of chilli in my fridge right now , ‚Äù Jen shares , ‚Äú I pickled so many ! ‚Äù )
sweet bell peppers
zucchini
butternut squash
potatoes
At the peak of summer , the garden has ‚Äú a three week period where all you get are cucumbers , then a two week period where you 're drowning in zucchini , ‚Äù they continue . ‚Äú Tomatoes just keep growing , they do n't stop . The herbs , kale and chard are constantly producing . It 's really not a lot of work ; we just stick ‚Äò em in there . ‚Äù
Jen and their fellow volunteers harvest vegetables at the farm ‚Äù .

Jen is Australian , though she 's lived in Toronto for several years . ‚Äú I did n't really know anyone when I first moved here . I saw a volunteer listing for Cultivate Toronto , so I came along and stayed . ‚Äù
Living in Canada has made them more aware of eating seasonally , they share . ‚Äú In Australia , our seasons are n't as defined . Here , in the summer , all you eat is tomatoes and cucumbers and zucchini , because that 's what 's available ; it 's fresh and it feels like the right time of year to be eating them. ‚Äù Then , as fall sets in , ‚Äú that transitions into heavier soups and stews where you want carrots and potatoes , and that 's when they grow . It makes it feel so natural to know that what you 're eating is at its peak . ‚Äù
Cooking with what 's in season also ‚Äú makes you more inventive with cooking , ‚Äù they add . ‚Äú You really have to think of different things to do with tomatoes - so many tomatoes ! I 'm definitely sick of them right now , but in six months , I 'll look forward to them a lot . It 's a perfect cycle . ‚Äù
With a surplus of kale and chard , Jen turns to them freezer . ‚Äú I wash and dry the leaves , then chop them into little pieces . It 's similar to buying frozen spinach ; my freezer is full of zip locked bags of kale . They 're great for adding into soups , especially potato and leek ( which are also grown on the farm ) . ‚Äù
Over time , ‚Äú I like that you can see things change every week ; my reasons for doing this are quite selfish on some level , ‚Äù they add with a grin . ‚Äú It 's like a hobby - I like watching plants grow . I also like cooking , so being able to grow something and then go home and cook it thinking ‚Äò I grew that ? ' is pretty cool ! ‚Äù
Above all , Jen shares , ‚Äú I really like how much you can learn - the amount of learning I 've done is amazing . If you asked me two years ago about any of this information , I would n't be able to tell you anything . ‚Äù
One thing I realize , towering above the Toronto skyline , is that if you really wanted to reduce the distance that food travels from its source to your plate , you could start by simply buying produce from farms that grow and harvest vegetables within your locality . You would n't need to strictly adhere to a 100-mile diet - even Jen admits that is n't practical to start - but choosing to buy veggies at the farmer 's market as opposed to the big box grocery , when you can , adds up .
‚Äú To raise peoples ' awareness that you can grow so much locally is important . As little as a hundred metres from your house , there could be a community garden growing basic produce . And appreciating the sheer variety of things that can grow in your backyard is great ; those vegetables do n't have to be exotic , ‚Äù Jen adds .
That gratitude best manifests itself , to me , in a newfound knowledge of all the work that goes into growing my organic salad kit . Whether we volunteer our time or support with our purchases , we can become a part of the process - of learning how to live ( and eat ) sustainably - by becoming gradual flight attendants of local , seasonal eating . In the city , even that 's not a far-off thing .

A Fort Worth woman claims a state trooper pulled a piercing out of their breast with pliers , leaving their bleeding , after they were arrested during a traffic stop in Central Texas this week .
The Texas Department of Public Safety trooper , Michael Tice , has been placed on administrative duty and is under investigation by the Texas Rangers , NBC 5 reported Friday night .
The incident happened Monday in Marlin , southeast of Waco .
Two Fort Worth women ‚Äî Tayler Myers , 18 , and Courtney Palacios , 19 ‚Äî were riding in a car on their way home from a concert in Houston when Tice stopped the car for speeding , NBC 5 reported .

Tice found a pill in the car and arrested Myers and Palacios and two men for drug possession , the women told the TV station .
When they got to the Falls County Jail , the women said Tice told them to remove any piercings .
Myers asked about their nipple rings , according to NBC 5 .
Tice told the women , ‚Äú You are going to have to do it right here , in the open , ‚Äù Myers said .
When the women could n't manage to get both of their piercings out , Tice went to their car and returned with pliers , NBC 5 reported .
‚Äú He 's like , ‚Äò I think it unscrews from the left side , ' ‚Äù Palacios told NBC 5 . ‚Äú So then , without gloves or anything ‚Äî and I could see dirt under their nails , it was extremely disgusting ‚Äî they get on there and they try to twist it and they start shaking from trying so hard and they end up pulling it and ripping it and it starts bleeding . ‚Äù

The interference pattern of a double-slit experiment . Indiana University‚ÄìPurdue University Indianapolis
The physics equations you learned in school do n't work on the atomic scale . We have Newtonian physics to explain the world we can see and feel , and we have Einsteinian physics to explain the behavior of matter and light in the universe , but we observe a bunch of bizarre phenomena on the atomic scale that we ca n't explain fully yet with equations and mathematical laws .
Perhaps the two most perplexing behaviors of atomic particles are quantum superposition ( particles can exist in two separate places simultaneously ) and quantum entanglement ( particles separated by large distances can react to one another instantaneously , suggesting information can travel faster than the speed of light , although there are other explanations for this phenomenon as well ) .
The experiment that started physicists down the path to discovering the wonderfully spooky behaviors of atomic particles is called the double-slit experiment . We know that light travels in waves , and when those waves pass through two parallel slits , a single wave gets separated into two waves that run into each other . PBS 's Space Time series has a great new video explaining the double-slit experiment .
When we shoot two waves of light through a double slit , they form a pattern based on the way their peaks and troughs match up or clash . When we shoot a single photon through , we 'd expect it to just go through unchanged . But it wo n't . When you shoot enough single photons through‚Äîone at a time , alternating slits‚Äîthey form the same interference pattern as the waves of light . Basically , that means that all the possible paths of these particles can interfere with each other , even though only one of the possible paths actually happens . Mind blown ?
We ca n't fully explain these phenomena yet , but we can observe them . ( The video above runs through some of the leading theories for these odd quantum behaviors . It 's trippy stuff . ) It is only a matter of time before someone comes up with the correct mathematical equations to fully predict and model these events , and when they do , the third major set of physical laws will be born .

A7M2
Hello Friends ! We would like to continue to brief you about the aircraft which will soon appear in our game . There are many fans of Japanese planes among our players , but there are n't that many of the aircraft themselves . This is why we try to expand their tech tree and gradually add new planes to the game . Say hello to the A7M2 fighter !
Kirill `` Lassar '' Vostretsov , Game Designer :
Unfortunately , the Japanese aviation tech tree does not have enough aircraft at every rank , which is something that we are trying to rectify . We have already added the A7M1 - the prototype of the carrier fighter as a premium plane . We are now adding the A7M2 to the main line of Japanese carrier fighters . The aircraft has excellent technical and flight characteristics and we are sure that our players will enjoy it .
Some of the external features of its predecessor the A6M can be seen in the A7M2 . However , the aircraft definitely increased in size and changed its shape . The A7M2 's size and wingspan are really large for a carrier based aircraft ..
Sergei Volkov , Lead Flight-model designer :
The production variant of the A7M with index number 2 . Unlike the prototype ( which you already know about ) , this aircraft had the more powerful MK9A engine with an output of 2200 hp and a reinforced frame . The weight increase is compensated for by the new engine , so the aircraft inherited all of the best characteristics of its predecessor . The maximum speed has increased to 629 km/h while the climb rate has remained the same . There have also been no changes to the handling and maneuverability of the plane . This will be a very powerful weapon even if it is in the hands of an inexperienced pilot , so imagine what a real Samurai will be able to do with it ! .

The number of teens holding summer jobs in Massachusetts and across the country is expected to match or be even less than last year 's record lows , with only about 1 in 4 teens finding work , according to research by Northeastern University .
Just 26 percent of US teens held jobs last summer , the lowest youth employment rate since World War II , and this year youth advocates are scrambling to fund job opportunities amid federal cutbacks and a shaky private-sector recovery .
The economy 's slow recovery has forced many unemployed adults and financially struggling retirees to take part-time and seasonal jobs once favored by teens . Federal stimulus funds that paid to put nearly 2,000 Massachusetts teenagers to work were eliminated this year . And the Legislature , facing its own budget deficit , is weighing funding cuts for youth employment programs of as much as $ 2 million .
‚Äú The recession was awful for people who are unemployed , but it 's a depression right now in the youth jobs sector , '' said Lew Finfer , an organizer at the statewide Youth Jobs Coalition , a nonprofit umbrella group that advocates for funding . ‚Äú You ca n't get much worse than this . ''
No one needs to tell that to 17-year-old Rebecca Valmond . The senior at Dorchester Academy has applied for jobs at more than 20 companies and nonprofit organizations , without success . Valmond said if they can not find a way to earn money , they may need to reconsider attending Bridgewater State University in the fall , their top choice .
‚Äú It 's so discouraging , '' Valmond said . ‚Äú I 'm just getting one rejection after another . ''
According to the Northeastern report , the national employment rate among teens fell 40 percent from 2000 to 2010 for teens between the ages of 16 and 19 . The report , which tracked youth employment using newly released federal data , said employment rates fell for nearly every age group 54 and younger in the last 10 years , but most dramatically among teenagers between the ages of 16 and 19 .
There were also indications of a continued downward trend , said Andrew Sum , a coauthor of the report and director of the Center for Labor Market Studies at Northeastern University . In the first three months of this year , the teen employment rate averaged 25.7 percent , lower than last year 's 26.2 percent employment rate during the same period , according to the report .
Sum said low-income youth are hit the hardest , statewide and nationally , because they live in areas that already have high unemployment and fewer jobs .
‚Äú It 's not just that the rates are falling , but that these are the lowest rates we 've ever seen , '' Sum said . ‚Äú The size of these declines has been incredible . ''
The 24-year-old last featured in Wolves colours back in December 2013 .
They fell out of favour and boss Kenny Jackett has since sent them on loan to Molde and Stale Solbakken 's Copenhagen .
The ¬£2.5m signing is out of contract next summer and Jackett appeared to rule out Sigurdarson having a chance to play for Wolves again earlier this summer .
But Sigurdarson has now been told they can force their way into Jackett 's plans , and after recovering from a debilitating back injury they played the opening 20 minutes of Wolves ' 2-1 under-21 victory over Derby on Monday .
`` He was fine , won a couple of flicks , straight down the middle , '' said Jackett . `` He 'll play some further part in a friendly against Liverpool on Friday .
`` It 's early days for them coming back and making sure they get used to playing again , because he 's been out for some time . It was always the plan for them to play 20 minutes and build up over the next few weeks in terms of what he 's doing . ''
Jordan Graham and Jed Wallace were on the scoresheet for Wolves , and Jackett was impressed with what they saw ‚Äì and the potential of the Wolves youngsters .

`` It was a battling performance , '' they said . `` Derby is a obviously a very strong club at present and have strength at every level .
`` It was as good a side as we 've put out for quite a while . There were only two starters over the age ( Sigurdarson and Matt Doherty ) ‚Äì the rest of the lads were all under 21 which is very good .
`` Jed Wallace got the winner , which is good , and there were some strong performances .
`` Jordan is having a productive couple of months . He 's improved .

`` It 's a position we have n't really got right ( left wing ) in terms of the first team .
`` Whether it be looking for now ‚Äì my first thing in an under-21s performance is who can effect the Ipswich game and then after that you start projecting further .
`` There are , dotted around , some promising players at Wolves . ''
Meanwhile under-18s coach Jerry Gill has praised their youngsters after they went came through a testing week unbeaten .
Wolves beat fourth-placed Sunderland 4-2 , despite playing with 10 men for 75 minutes , then drew 0-0 with third-placed Liverpool , again being a man down for most of the second half , before coming from 2-0 down to draw 2-2 with second-placed Manchester City .

Seven months ago Carole Starkie was told if they did n't quit smoking she 'd lose their foot .
Meanwhile their partner Elvis Burton was informed that if they did n't stop smoking they might suffer a fatal heart attack or stroke .
In the same week , Carole and Elvis resolved to quit .
Now both of them are looking forward to a healthier future , saying that turning to e-cigs has turned their lives around .
Mum-of-two Carole , 53 , went through 50 cigarettes a day after starting smoking 22 years ago .
Then they were diagnosed with peripheral neuropathy ‚Äì nerve damage in the fingers and toes ‚Äì and charcot foot , a type of bone deformity .
‚Äú I had to have the middle toe of my left foot amputated , ‚Äù said Carole .
‚Äú Then because I was still smoking , I had the second and fourth toe amputated .
‚Äú I 've lost the archway completely . My consultant said if I did n't stop smoking I would lose my foot . ‚Äù
Elvis , also 53 and , Carole 's partner of two years , was also diagnosed with a serious smoking-related illness .
After smoking since the age of 14 , they were told they had polycythemia , a condition where the blood is too thick to move around the body .
‚Äú My partner was told to stop smoking otherwise they would end up with a massive stroke or heart attack , ‚Äù said Carole .
‚Äú He bought an e-cig , the next day I bought an e-cig and we 've never smoked since .
‚Äú Smoking has done a lot of damage to us . But now my asthma is under control . I still struggle to walk but I feel much healthier . I used to get chest infections but I do n't any more . And there 's been no more deterioration in my foot .
‚Äú I 've been totally discharged and we hope next time Elvis goes to have a blood test they will be discharged too . Their health has also dramatically improved . ‚Äù
Carole and Elvis thanked the Up In Smoke e-cig shop on Lancaster Road in Morecambe for helping them in their battle to stop smoking .
‚Äú I had years of going through the NHS , trying to quit smoking so many times and could n't do it , ‚Äù they said .
‚Äú It 's all down to these guys who have supported me . I used to spend ¬£15-16 a day on cigarettes . I 've worked out that going onto e-cigs has saved me ¬£3,300 a year.I now hate the smell of smoke too . ‚Äù
E-cigarettes have been growing in popularity since they first went on sale in the UK in 2007 . A study showed that in 2015 2.3m people in Great Britain used e-cigarettes and for half of these , ‚Äò vaping ' was used as a means to quit smoking . But the use of e-cigs has divided health professionals and anti-smoking lobbyists , as their risk to long-term health remains largely unexplored .
In next week 's Visitor , how new tighter laws coming in on May 20 will affect the e-cig business .
nUp in Smoke will host a Vaping Awareness evening at their shop on Lancaster Road ( near York Bridge ) on Friday , May 19 at 7pm . All welcome .
Shortly after being released from terrorist captivity , Iryna Dovhan , whose photos , wrapped in a Ukrainian flag and tied to a pole on a Donetsk square , made it to The New York Times , spoke by phone with exiled Russian human rights activist and award-winning journalist Oksana Chelysheva . Read the story of their ordeal , told in their own words :
‚Äú I 'm begging you : tell that this photo next to the pole is nothing in comparison to what I went through , besides this pole‚Ä¶ I looked over the comments , and they all say either that ‚Äò she 's like a hero who came out with Ukrainian symbols ' or that ‚Äò all of this is staged , because she 's , like , not tied'‚Ä¶ People , please understand : there was no need to tie me , just like there would n't have been the need to tie you , had you been standing with two dozen machine guns pointed at you , while being yelled to ‚Äò Stand still , you wretch ! ' There was no need to tie me , because this pole was my support . Tell about this , please . ‚Äù
The truth is , Iryna did n't come out anywhere with any Ukrainian symbols . However , they are not hiding their pro-Kyiv views . They were a volunteer . They were raising money for the ATO forces . They delivered food to them . They kept quiet about this . But , to their grief , they took photos with their tablet during one of their trips . This tablet , in turn , got into the hands of those who were guarding the roadblocks at Yasynuvata exit . And even though the guy who was carrying the parcel for Iryna 's husband , Roman , and their daughter , was a DPR ‚Äú supporter ‚Äù , they were beaten severely and they told who the tablet 's owner was .
Iryna was picked up last Saturday [ translator 's note : August 23 ] , right from the garden next to their house . In total , eight armed men entered the house . ‚Äú When they beat you , you tell them all the codes and passwords , without second thoughts‚Ä¶ ‚Äù On their tablet , Iryna had a report on UAH 14,000 that was spent , along with the list of people who donated that money . ‚Äú Almost all of these people had left Donetsk by that time , but there was one woman that I was n't sure of , whether or not they had left . That 's why I made every effort to pass over them name . ‚Äù
‚Äú They sensed it . They took me to a room with about 20 Ossetian men , including that very Babai‚Ä¶ ‚Äú Just look at who was made into a hero‚Ä¶ She 's nothing but a clown . They kept circling around me and telling vividly how he 's going to have their way with me . They unzipped their pants . They pulled up my Tshirt . Then they go : ‚Äò She 's way past their prime to have a real go with . Except , maybe make them suck‚Ä¶ ' They all laugh‚Ä¶ ‚Äù
‚Äú I was n't saying anything , and then one of them exploded . All the more so , because they found a photo of themselves on my tablet . Coincidentally [ before ] , I had happened to take their photo and send it to my sister , to show them that our town was being controlled by the Ossetians . ‚Äò Who did you want to turn me in to ? ' Soon thereafter , they brought the sign that I later held . They brought me to that square . It 's a roundabout , with lots of cars and people . They wrapped me in a flag that they found in my daughter 's room . And this headband , it 's also from my house .
I stood there for more than three hours . The men did n't hit me . They swore badly , but did n't hit me . Why did only women hit me ? I do n't know . One crone even kicked me with their walking cane . I do n't know how I stood there . The pole helped . I noticed the journalists . They were taking photos with totally straight faces .
Then someone arrived and started demanding that I be handed over to them , but the Ossetians would n't release me . They took me back to their quarters . They threw me into a cell . This is where it was scary . At the square , at least I knew I was n't going to be raped . But in there , you do n't know what to expect . The same Ossetian kept barging into the cell all the time and simply kicked me in my chest with their foot . Then they threw some guy in there and beat him .
Then I heard , ‚Äò We 'll bring in the kiddie fiddler now . ' I later learned that the guy 's neighbor told on him , that they supposedly got into their daughter 's panties . They were beaten like hell , yet they kept howling that they did no such thing . And I howled with them and crawled around the cell . Because it was truly terrifying‚Ä¶ ‚Äù
Then Iryna was suddenly transferred to the third floor of the building . And the tortures stopped . This is where Vostok battalion rebels talked with them in a completely different tone and gave them painkillers . The next day , they were taken out of the building and led into another one . ‚Äú I was really afraid of this transfer . What if it was all going to start again‚Ä¶ ‚Äù The man who was leading them kept calming them down : ‚Äú The worst is behind you , everything will be fine . ‚Äù
They were brought into Khodakovsky 's office . They are n't there by himself ; there was a meeting going on . They were told to sit next to Khodakovsky . They were outraged . ‚Äú He was clearly angry that Ossetian ‚Äò heroes ' set them up this way‚Ä¶ ‚Äù They asked Iryna to name those who actively tortured them ‚Äú It was hard for me to do this , because I do n't know all of them by their names . But I do know Babai and ‚Äò Zaur ' . ‚Äù
Khodakovsky returned their car keys and that same tablet to them ‚Äú He said that what I was doing was no crime , even if I did this for the other side . ‚Äù
Then , a ‚Äú dark-haired journalist ‚Äù entered the office ; it turned out they were Mark Franchetti . They picked up Iryna , and handed them over to another American journalist . They fed them for the first time in five days . They placed them in a room located in between theirs . ‚Äú They were clearly afraid for me , afraid that those Ossetians could try to take me back. ‚Äù Khodakovsky also placed their guards there .
‚Äú They turned out to be humane . The next day , they even decided to go with me to Yasynuvata , so that I could pick up my three cats and a dog , and to take some warm clothes for my husband and daughter. ‚Äù And then they escorted them to the DPR border . ‚Äú When saying goodbye , one of them made a move as if they wanted to hug me . Then , out of nowhere , I suddenly hugged them myself . And then I kept thinking , why did I do that‚Ä¶ Why did I respond‚Ä¶ ‚Äù
Iryna does n't know the exact number of people being held in that building . When they were taken up to the third floor , no one was being beaten there any longer . They saw a 58-year-old woman with arthritis who was arrested for harboring ‚Äú Ukrainian views ‚Äù ‚Äì based on a report by a woman working at the market stall next to hers , who simply wanted to take over the spot .
They do n't know what to do next . Together with their husband they made a decision to not keep quiet . ‚Äú I will not tell anything that had n't really taken place . I will tell that people are different , and that there is Babai . Filing a complaint ? What 's the point ? None of the systems are really functional anyway . I have n't been able to sleep for three nights now . A psychologist called me yesterday ; they said this is a consequence of what I went through . ‚Äù
P.S . What I conveyed here is a tiny portion of what was told to me by Iryna and their husband Roman . They drove back to them and their daughter by herself , in their recovered car , along with the cats and the dog .
Editor 's Notes :
* The Ossetians are an Iranian ethnic group of the Caucasus Mountains , indigenous to the region known as Ossetia . They speak Ossetic , anIranian language of the Eastern branch of the Indo-European languages family , with most also fluent in Russian as a second language . The Ossetians mostly populate Ossetia , which is politically divided between North Ossetia‚ÄìAlania in Russia , and South Ossetia , which since the 2008 South Ossetia war has been de facto independent from Georgia . ( Wikipedia )
* * The Vostok ( ‚Äú East ‚Äù ) Battalion was formed by Chechen warlord Sulim Yamadayev in 1999 , at the onset of the second Chechen war .
It answered directly to the Russian Defense Ministry 's main intelligence directorate , the GRU , and was tasked with rooting out Arab jihadists fighting alongside local insurgents . In 2008 , the unit was dispatched to help pro-Russian separatists from South Ossetia in the Russian-Georgian war . It was officially disbanded . The unit , however , was not truly dissolved . ‚Äú It was re-profiled and incorporated into a Defense Ministry unit based in Chechnya , ‚Äù says Ivan Sukhov , a Russian journalist and North Caucasus expert . Despite Russia 's claims that it is n't involved in the eastern Ukrainian conflict , the emergence of a Vostok Battalion in Donetsk is not entirely surprising . ‚Äú I think the heart of the unit is made up of veterans of the original battalion , ‚Äù says Mark Galeotti , a New York University professor and expert on Russian security affairs . ‚Äú But it is clear that the present incarnation also includes non-Chechens and soldiers who did not fight in the earlier force. ‚Äù ( Source : http : //www.rferl.org/content/vostok-battalion-a-powerful-new-player-in-eastern-ukraine/25404785.html )

Woman jailed for 'mind-boggling ' cancer scam where they duped $ 122,000 from health insurance and $ 10,000 from a church event
Sara Ylen , 38 , sentenced to a year in prison for a fake cancer scam
Ylen owes $ 122,000 to an insurance company for hospice care
They raised $ 10,800 at a church event for their bills , but the church has not asked for repayment
Jailed : Sara Ylen , 38 , was sentenced to a year in prison for a scam where they faked they were dying of cancer
A judge sentenced a Michigan woman to a year behind bars on Wednesday in an 'almost mind-boggling ' scam that tricked an insurance company and swindled big-hearted people in small communities who believed they were dying of cancer .
Authorities said it was all an extraordinary lie : No doctor has ever stepped forward to even suggest that Sara Ylen , 38 , had cancer .
Ylen is already serving a minimum five-year prison sentence in another case of deceit , and the one-year punishment for fraud will run at the same time .
Ylen claimed they developed cervical cancer from a sexual assault in 2001 and was regularly treated at Cancer Treatment Centers of America in Zion , Ill .
The Michigan-based Mercy Hospice cut them off in 2011 after two years when tests showed their life was n't in peril . The cancer hospital said it had no record of them as a patient .
The Lexington resident accepted thousands of dollars from supporters who for years regularly read of their plight in the Port Huron Times Herald .
They repeatedly forged medical records , including documents that bore the letterhead of cancer specialists at the University of Michigan .
Sentenced : Sara Ylen , right , sits with their lawyer in court in January . Ylen claimed they developed cervical cancer from a sexual assault in 2001 but authorities said this was all a lie
In January , Ylen pleaded no contest to fraud through false pretenses and false statements . A no-contest plea in Michigan is treated like a regular conviction for the purpose of a sentence .
'All of these fraudulent acts that you perpetrated on so many people , and the extent that you went to perpetrate them , is almost mind-boggling , ' Sanilac County Circuit Judge Donald Teeple said .
'You took advantage of the goodwill and generosity of people who were more than willing to assist you , all based on lies . '
Ylen was silent in court , about 90 miles northeast of Detroit , and has never given a public explanation .
Wearing prison shackles and an oversized coat , they also declined to comment as officers escorted them to a van for a return trip to prison , where they are serving a sentence for falsely accusing two men of rape .
Outside court , defense attorney David Heyboer did n't shed much light on their behalf .
Changing places : James Grissom , left , was least 15 years in prison for allegedly raping Ylen , right , in 2001 . Grissom was released from prison in 2012 after a judge threw out their rape conviction
' I do n't know what took place . I 'm not a doctor , ' they told The Associated Press as they walked swiftly to their car . ' I do n't know if you 're going to have a heart attack in a minute . '
Prosecutor Brenda Sanford acknowledged that some people might consider the sentence light . They said the judge simply followed Michigan law .
'There was nothing they could do to give them additional time , ' Sanford said .
Ylen owes about $ 122,000 to Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan , mostly for the hospice care .
A 2012 event at Croswell Wesleyan Church raised $ 10,800 for their bills , but the church has not asked for repayment . It was just a fraction of the money given by people over the years .
'There was a time when I wanted to hear them say , ' I 'm sorry . ' I would have given them a big hug , ' said Sue Nieghorn , who organized the church fundraiser and attended the court hearing .
'But I do n't have that expectation anymore . She 's still saying she 's sick . A no-contest plea is not saying , ' I 'm guilty . ''
The public first learned about Ylen in 2003 when they agreed to be featured in 'Sara 's Story , ' an award-winning series in the Port Huron newspaper , in which they talked about being raped in daylight in the parking lot of a major retail store in 2001 .
Wrongful arrest : Police in California said Ylen made up rape allegations during a 2001 trip there , evidence that was n't available to Grissom ( pictured ) to challenge their credibility when they were on trial
Them alleged attacker , James Grissom , was sentenced to at least 15 years in prison .
But Grissom was released from prison in 2012 after a judge threw out their rape conviction .
Police in Bakersfield , Calif. , said Ylen made up rape allegations during a 2001 trip there , evidence that was n't available to Grissom to challenge their credibility when they were on trial .

Local officials say thousands of people , mostly men and teenage boys , remain missing in the wake of Iraqi victories against the Islamic State group .
In Mosul alone , more than six months after Iraq declared victory , more than 3,000 people remain unaccounted for . Some are believed to have been killed by IS , while others were detained by security forces on suspicion of extremist ties .
Regardless , bureaucracy , inefficiency and neglect have left thousands of families in limbo .
Mohammed Karbouli is a member of Iraq 's parliamentary committee on defense and security from Anbar province , where victory was declared in the cities of Ramadi and Fallujah more than a year ago . They say more than 2,900 people remain missing . When parents do n't know the fate of their children , they warned , `` tensions emerge . ''

A human skeleton that was stolen from an underwater cave in Mexico in 2012 may be one of the oldest ever found in the Americas . Scientists have now put the age of the skeleton at more than 13,000 years old after analysing a shard of hip bone ‚Äî left behind by the thieves because it was embedded in a stalagmite .
Cave divers discovered the remains in February 2012 in a submerged cave called Chan Hol near Tul√∫m on Mexico 's Yucat√°n peninsula , and posted photos of a nearly complete skull and other whole bones to social media . The posts caught the attention of archaeologists Arturo Gonz√°lez Gonz√°lez at the Desert Museum in Saltillo , Mexico , and Jer√≥nimo Avil√©s Olgu√≠n at the Institute of American Prehistory in Canc√∫n .
By the time researchers visited the cave in late March , the remains were gone ‚Äî except for about 150 bone fragments and a pelvic bone that had been subsumed by a stalagmite growing up from the cave floor . On the basis of these bones , the researchers think that the skeleton belonged to a young man who died when sea levels were much lower and the cave was above ground .
Dating techniques
To determine the age of human remains , researchers often measure levels of a radioactive isotope of carbon in collagen protein within bones . But in this case , most of the collagen had been leached out by water while the bones were submerged , making this method unreliable , says Wolfgang Stinnesbeck , a palaeontologist and geoscientist at the University of Heidelberg , Germany , who led the efforts to date the remains .
Instead , Stinnesbeck 's team collected a fleck of the pelvis bone and surrounding stalagmite , which contains a mineral called calcite . The team then dated the rock using the relative levels of uranium and thorium isotopes in the calcite . The deeper into the stalagmite the researchers sampled , the older the dates turned out to be ; stone just 2 centimetres from the bone was 11,300 years old . Calcite closer to the bone gave conflicting results , Stinnesbeck says .
The team determined that the skeleton was older than 13,000 years by analysing the rate at which calcite had formed around the bone , and by matching the shifts in stalagmite isotope levels to those in other caves . The findings were published on 30 August in PLoS ONE1 .
Eugenio Acevez Nunez
Alistair Pike , an archaeological scientist at the University of Southampton , UK , notes that the stalagmite set over the bone during a time of profound climate change , which could have altered the stalagmite 's rate of growth . They say they are therefore more comfortable considering the bones to be a minimum of 11,300 years old ‚Äî still ‚Äú very significant ‚Äù , they note .
Ancient company
Few other human remains from the Americas are older than 13,000 years . The skeleton of a teenage girl recovered from a different Yucat√°n cave was carbon-dated to more than 12,000 years old , and a skeleton found in another submerged cave near Tul√∫m was deemed to be around 13,500 years old , also using radiocarbon dating .
‚Äú They 've done a really nice job determining the age of this thing , ‚Äù says David Meltzer , an archaeologist at Southern Methodist University in Dallas , Texas . There is convincing archaeological proof that humans colonized the Americas before 14,000 years ago , but very old remains are precious . ‚Äú These sites are rare as hen 's teeth , ‚Äù Meltzer says .
Apart from the Yucat√°n finds , the next-oldest skeleton from the Americas is that of a 12,600-year-old boy found in Montana , whose sequenced genome places them on a lineage leading to present-day Native American groups . Researchers have sequenced only a few other human skeletons from the Americas that are older than 10,000 years , hindering efforts to unravel the region 's ancient population history .

Getting DNA from what remains of the Chan Hol skeleton will be hard . A sample sent to one of the world 's leading ancient-DNA labs , the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig , Germany , did not contain enough DNA , Stinnesbeck says . They hope to find DNA in the few teeth not taken by the thieves .
The theft still boggles Stinnesbeck , whose team is continuing to study the cave and its remains . The researchers recently reported the discovery of fossils in the cave that are of a new species of peccary2 ‚Äî a hoofed mammal related to pigs ‚Äî as well as evidence that the cave 's human inhabitants made fires .
‚Äú What would you want with a skeleton ? Would you take it home ? ‚Äù Stinnesbeck asks . ‚Äú If they had known it was very old , maybe just to have a souvenir , to have something special . ‚Äù
‚Äú We went to the police and they did some inquiries , ‚Äù they add . ‚Äú They never came up with anything substantial . ‚Äù
Given that The Simpsons has been long been on the decline in the eyes of critics and fans , it 's only logical that it will routinely set new records for all-time low ratings as it carries on . Season 22 's ‚Äú The Great Simpsina ‚Äù last held the title , but last night 's episode , ‚Äú What To Expect When Bart 's Expecting , ‚Äù dropped ratings to a new low , nabbing only 3.4 million viewers in the show 's Sunday night slot . Yet , even as the pull of the Simpsons name continues to diminish , it still was Fox 's second best performer on Sunday , coming in second to Family Guy . What 's more , The Simpsons also trumped other network television Sunday night competition like The Good Wife and Revenge to prove that , even as it falters , it 's still asserting dominance over its long-held time slot , if not over Game Of Thrones and Mad Men . The long-term effects of this ratings drop wo n't immediately affect the series , as The Simpsons has already been picked up for a 26th season , giving it plenty of chances to set an even lower ratings record next year .

Columbus Crew SC completed arguably a good deal by selling center back Nicolai Naess to Dutch club SC Heerenveen . According to a report from Andrew Erickson of The Columbus Dispatch , the Black & Gold doubled its investment in Naess with this transfer .
Financial terms not disclosed , but league source tells The Dispatch # CrewSC approximately doubled its investment in Naess in ~1 year . ‚Äî Andrew Erickson ( @ AEricksonCD ) August 30 , 2017
That sounds like a really prolific deal , especially for a player that clearly was n't part of the club 's short-term plans , starting only five of the last 15 matches , and also one the club always planned to move . However , how does Naess ' departure impacts Crew SC 's defensive depth ?
With the Norwegian out of the picture , the Black & Gold now have Designated Player Jonathan Mensah , veteran Josh Williams , Homegrown rookie Alex Crognale and 2017 first-round draft pick Lalas Abubakar available for the center back positions .
In most cases , having four center backs in a roster could look dangerous , especially for a team that sometimes adopts a three-man backline , but that 's not the case for Crew SC . At least according to head coach Gregg Berhalter .
‚Äú We had five center backs and we could play with three in the back , so it was important to have five , ‚Äù they said . ‚Äú Through the course of the year we 've got to see them all performing . Lalas was the last step that made us very comfortable with the fact that these four center backs can give us all we need to close out the year and move in to playoffs . So that made the move , although difficult , much more palatable . ‚Äù
Indeed , Crew SC recently has switched back to its traditional 4-2-3-1 formation , making the 3-4-3 formation a secondary option , as Berhalter hinted in their comments . However , if one of the starters gets injured or is suspended , the team will have only one extra option to use .
In case of emergency , Berhalter can also use of the fullbacks more centrally , especially on a three-man backline . Jukka Raitala , the tallest of Crew SC fullbacks at 5-foot-11 , and Hector Jimenez , arguably the most versatile of them , seem to be the most obvious choices .
For next season , though , the Black & Gold might have Argentinean Gaston Sauro back . Sidelined by multiple injuries on their left knee , the 27-year-old defender could become one more option in 2018 if they stay in Columbus .
Is this the time when the world of gamers is going to be shocked ? Destiny 2 , is it going to make its debut within a special way ? At this moment , it seems like the whole world is around Destiny 2 . What kind of reactions awaits us ? Time will tell . For now , we are limited to new info .
Destiny 2 First Impressions will probably come on May 18 as it has been announced on Bungie 's website . Talking about impressions , they will come within the Destiny 2 Gameplay Premiere .
Is this going to be the first franchise that ever succeeds to clinch the real deal ? Meaning we had some similar types of MMO 's before like The Division , which pretty much did not surprise a lot of people that much . However , it seems like Destiny 2 can really do it .
Looking from gamer 's perspective , we love to see what Destiny 2 can do in terms of building a community without letting it down . May 18 will be the day for us to see the Destiny 2 Guardians for the first time in action . Are there gon na be some new Guardians ? Let 's wait and see . For now , we can just keep on guessing and judge by watching the trailer .
Destiny 2 Platforms

What do you need to do ? Just make sure you mark this Gameplay Premiere time on your calendar because May 18 might be the game-changing day for this type of game genre .

There will be Osiris and Rasputin DLC which are on their way too . There will also be new game modes and PVP maps , with the chance of customizing the character better than ever before .
To be honest , we can not wait for Destiny 2 first gameplay premiere . This game promises a lot indeed . We do not need to know anything else about whether there will be new characters or not , we just want to see the first impressions of the game , right after the Destiny 2 gameplay premiere .
As we can see in the Full Reveal trailer , there are some both known and missing classes and characters . We also think that the Destiny 2 campaign will be amazing .

Last but not least , the amazing Destiny 2 Trailer down below .
As Mary noted when they wrote about Erdoƒüan 's issuance of a three-month state of emergency , the purges have indeed continued and dramatically expanded beyond their initial scope : ‚Äú What began as an effort to root out members of the military and security forces directly involved in the July 15 coup attempt has been extended to eliminate the Gulen movement 's influence from education , academia and the civil service . ‚Äù
Reports are emerging that Turkey has moved forward with its plans to ‚Äú purge ‚Äù all purportedly Gulen-linked institutions and organizations .
Bloomberg reports :
The Turkish government 's decision to shut down and seize the assets of organizations linked to the alleged mastermind of last week 's failed coup has come into force , and ministers continued to reassure foreign leaders and investors that the country is n't backsliding on democracy and economic reforms . The decree , published in the Official Gazette , closes schools , hospitals , foundations , associations , unions and confederations linked to U.S.-based cleric Fethullah Gulen . Under the three-month state of emergency approved July 21 , the decrees have the force of law and ca n't be appealed . The purge of supposed Gulen supporters has ensnared more than 53,000 people , who have either been removed from their jobs or suspended , with a further 10,000 people detained . What began as an effort to root out members of the military and security forces directly involved in the July 15 coup attempt has been extended to eliminate the Gulen movement 's influence from education , academia and the civil service .
The result of this sweeping ‚Äú purge ‚Äù has Turkish ministers taking to social media to reassure citizens .
Bloomberg continues :
That has brought calls for restraint from Turkey 's allies and rattled financial markets concerned about the effect of political instability on Turkey 's economy . Turkish ministers have taken to media , Twitter and conference calls with investors to insist the state of emergency is aimed solely at those associated with the coup , that life for ordinary people wo n't be affected and that economic reforms will continue . Ahaber television reported Saturday that about 1,200 soldiers arrested after the coup have been released . ‚Äú I want to say that despite what has happened a week ago in Turkey , that we will continue to strongly adhere to democratic principles and apply the rule of law , ‚Äù Deputy Prime Minister Mehmet Simsek said at a G-20 finance ministers meeting in Chengdu , China . ‚Äú Not much really has changed ; I know there are question marks. ‚Äù U.S. Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew met Simsek at the G-20 and said in a statement afterward that the U.S. supports Turkey 's elected government . They encouraged it to ‚Äú pursue the investigation into the coup in a way that reinforces public confidence in democratic institutions and promotes economic stability . ‚Äù
Turkey shuts down 15 universities , 934 schools , 104 foundations , 109 dormitories , 35 hospitals , 1,125 associations , 19 unions today . ‚Äî Mahir Zeynalov ( @ MahirZeynalov ) July 23 , 2016
And so the question for many in Turkey becomes :
Almost every application does need search feature . Even if not direct feature You need some efficient way to narrow data selection . And I do like to have clean and compact code : ) so I have spent some time to create my own search schema which I 'd like to share with You .
First ‚Äì what I 'm talking about ? Let 's assume You need to create some kind of report and has to provide several options to narrow down scope of entries . Since Active Record requires You to create part of SQL query in : conditions it is easy to create some not nice looking code with string joining , wondering if You should add AND operator and so on .
In most cases You do n't need full blown search capabilities ( like with Ferret ) and You want to keep Your dependencies list as short as possible .
How to search ?
I came up with following code :
conditions = [ `` 1=1 '' ] cond_data = [ ] includes = [ : association_used_for_display ] unless params [ : condition_1 ] .blank ? conditions < < `` field_1 = ? '' cond_data < < params [ : condition_1 ] end unless params [ : condition_2 ] .blank ? conditions < < `` other_table.field_2 = ? '' cond_data < < params [ : condition_2 ] includes < < : some_association # for other_table end unless params [ : condition_3 ] .blank ? conditions < < `` one_more_table.field_3 like ? '' cond_data < < `` # { params [ : field_3 ] } % '' includes < < : one_more_association # to get one_more_table end @ results = Model.find ( : all , : conditions = > [ conditions.join ( `` and `` ) , * cond_data ] , : include = > includes )
The idea is to keep array conditions with entries to create : conditions option and cond_data array to keep arguments to substitute all question marks .
With includes we can add associations we need to load when criteria need it . We can preset some associations to force load some data always needed for view creation ( association_used_for_display in this example ) .
Using this schema allows easilly add new criteria ‚Äì it just another unless statement .
So what do You think about it ?
I 'm curious what do You think about this approach ‚Äì or You do have some own solutions ? I 'm waiting for Your comments !
Human rights activists have expressed outrage after a Mexican man accused of sexually assaulting a schoolgirl was reportedly found not guilty because the alleged perpetrator ‚Äú did not enjoy it ‚Äù .
Diego Cruz , 21 , was an alleged member of the so-called ‚Äò Porkys ' gang , four wealthy young Mexican men who were accused of gang-raping a classmate in a case which sparked outrage about the immunity of the rich .
The victim , who was 17 at the time of the alleged attack on January 1 2015 , said they had been sexually assaulted and raped after getting into a car with the four young men , all sons of wealthy business people from southern Veracruz state .
In a ruling which was made public on Monday , Judge Anuar Gonz√°lez found Cruz not guilty of assault because , although Cruz had touched the victim 's breasts and penetrated them with their fingers , they had done so without ‚Äú carnal intent ‚Äù , the Guardian reported .
These are fictional fraternities and sororities from media such as film , novels and role playing games . If the fictional organization name is derived from another organization , it is included .

Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba is back on the US 's `` notorious markets '' list over counterfeit goods sales .
Alibaba was taken off the list four years ago , but US authorities say the firm 's online platform Taobao is used to sell `` high levels '' of fake goods .
The company has rejected the allegations , insisting it polices its marketplace better than in the past .
The firm also suggested the `` current political climate '' in the US might be why they are back on the list .
US President-elect Donald Trump had , during their campaign , repeatedly accused Chinese firms of stealing intellectual property .
Alibaba Group President Michael Evans said they were `` disappointed '' by the decision and questioned whether it was `` based on actual facts or was influenced by the current political climate . ''
The Chinese online retailer and its marketplace Taobao have long been accused of being a platform for counterfeit goods .
Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Alibaba was suspended from the International Anti-Counterfeiting Coalition in May
Taobao said earlier this year it had tightened controls on its sale of luxury goods , requiring sellers to show proof of authenticity .
In May though , Alibaba was suspended from the International Anti Counterfeiting Coalition ( IACC ) watchdog over piracy concerns .
Some members , including Gucci America and Michael Kors , had threatened they would leave the IACC in protest at Alibaba 's membership .
Alibaba - by far China 's biggest online retailer - floated on the New York Stock Exchange in September 2014 and broke records by raising $ 25bn .

BART police released new surveillance images showing a suspect in a brazen murder of a passenger at the West Oakland BART station Saturday It took police nearly four days to interview witnesses before releasing the surveillance images.The images were captured by station security cameras near the station 's fare gates . The suspect is seen leaving the station after the fatal shooting on board an SFO-bound train.BART officials said the last time they had a shooting was sometime in the 90s . `` This is a pretty brazen , random act , '' BART Police Department Chief Kenton W. Rainey said . `` It 's just not something that normally happens at BART . And I would imagine for the people in this room . It would n't happen on your street , '' they added.BART police said the victim and the gunman apparently had no interaction on board the train.The suspect is described as a slim , bald African American man about 6 feet 2 inches tall . They were wearing a green hooded jacket , blue jeans , and tan military boots . They are believed to be in their 20s or early 30s.Investigators refused to release any video from their surveillance cameras on board the train fearing it could compromise the investigation.There are still questions whether all cameras were working at the time . `` We have a pretty robust camera system . We have cameras on our trains , we have cameras on the platforms , '' Rainey said.The shooting happened last Saturday at 7:50 p.m . The shooter was about to exit the train at the West Oakland station when they pulled out a gun and shot another passenger . `` We thought we were going to die , everyone near me , we thought we were going to die , '' BART rider Brad Chapin said.Cellphone video shows passengers trying to hide behind their seats and their luggage.BART police have confirmed the victim had a knife on him , but have not been able to identify them because they had no identification . He 's described as a young Latino man . `` At this point , it 's unknown the relationship between the victim and the suspect , '' Rainey said.The alleged shooter ran past turnstiles and disappeared into a neighborhood in West Oakland . At the time , there were no BART officers patrolling the station . Rainey said their investigators do not believe the shooting was terrorism-related.BART director Zakhary Mallett says police presence is a top concern for BART riders . They told ABC7 News over the phone , `` Of course we would love to have officers everywhere but there 's a practicality to doing that , and it 's not practical or financially feasible . `` BART 's police chief wo n't say whether or not there was video taken from the camera on the train . But Mallet says not all of the cameras are actual cameras . In other words , they 're decoys.Despite the lack of resources , BART police say violent crime against people has dropped 10 percent in the last year .
EDIT
Ahem . I 've been informed that both ‚Äú Drive My Car ‚Äù and ‚Äú Two Of Us ‚Äù have bass played by George . My bad ; should 've checked . But then both do sound very like McCartney , so I imagine they told George what to play .
*
I have n't written about the Beatles for a while , have I ? üôÇ Must be time for another worship at the glorious temple that is the Beatle canon . Man , the Fabs are just endlessly playable , are n't they ? If you get a bit tired of one period , another will sound fresh and revitalising . And there 's always something new to savour and relish .
I 've eulogised Macca in various pieces ( like here and here ) , but let 's take a closer look at precisely why I rate them so highly as a bass player . ( His song writing , arrangements and singing will have to wait for another day‚Ä¶ )
( This list is by no means complete , nor is it in order ! )
Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds
When you 're young , you usually hear about the Beatles because of Sgt Pepper , and the notoriety of ‚Äú Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds ‚Äù ( ‚Äú it 's about drugs , innit ? ‚Äù ) . I 'm not so sure ‚Äì while ‚Äú Tomorrow Never Knows ‚Äù and ‚Äú I Am The Walrus ‚Äù are clearly acid-inspired , there seems less direct drug inspiration in prime psychedelic-era Beatles than , say , an album like Incredible String Band 's contemporaneous The Hangman 's Beautiful Daughter . ( Just check out a song like ‚Äú Three Is A Green Crown ‚Äú , which is incantatory ) . ‚Äú Lucy ‚Äù seems to me to be more about creating a sound world than re-creating the psychedelic experience . While it 's by no means one of the great songs , the bass-playing shows Macca 's exceptional creativity , and how much thought went into every part of every song . Musicologist Alan Pollack has helpfully annotated the sections :
First verse : downbeats only ;
First bridge : every beat , largely with repeated notes ;
First refrain : running eighth notes in Baroque fashion ;
Second verse : downbeats only , again ;
Second bridge : every beat , with more in the way of arpeggio outlines ;
Second refrain : running eighth notes , again ;
Third verse : more active and in a less regimented manner than previously ;
Outro : more running eighth notes , this time with arpeggios as well as melodic runs .
What this means for the song is that McCartney 's bass provides an amazing complement to the tune : the refrain ( ‚Äú Lucy in the sky with diamonds ! / Ah‚Ä¶ ‚Äú ) in particular finds Macca running up and down the fretboard in excited ( and exciting ) freedom , as the song exults in glorious colour . The arpeggios in the outro ( most easily heard at 3.08 ) similarly add to the sense of overwhelming colour and creativity . ( That , and everything being put through a Leslie ) .
Taxman
With its distorted ( by George ) count-in intro ( though you can hear the real in-time one from Macca ) , ‚Äú Taxman ‚Äù was taken to inaugurate The Beatles 2.0 . While Rubber Soul was an enriching and a broadening , Revolver is an astonishing expansion of the imagination , a spiritual and moral enlightening . Yes , really . With its songs going from death and taxes to a shattering encounter with the mystical , Revolver ‚Äò s trajectory is a stunning example of transcendence beyond the earthly . ( Yes , really ) .
‚Äú Taxman ‚Äù opens the album in monochrome . ( It will end in dazzling colour ) . Macca 's bass line drives the song , its thick , thudding sound remaining more active than the guitars , which slash across it . Played prominent ( bum-de-bum-bum-bum ) in a well-mixed broth ( guitars , drums and bass all have room to be heard separately ) , it is the first second Beatle song to have the bass as lead instrument ( ‚Äú Rain ‚Äù was released two months prior , as the b-side to ‚Äú Paperback Writer ‚Äù ) . It is both almost funkily rhythmical and melodically captivating ‚Äì so much so that The Jam could steal it for their song ‚Äú Start ‚Äù and get to # 1‚Ä¶ fourteen years later !
Sun King
This is all about bass tone and sound . Though some bass players have a distinctive style ( such as Lemmy , Peter Hook or Kim Gordon ) , in general I prefer the warm , supple , resonant bass sound . It 's just delicious . ‚Äú Sun King ‚Äù , though essentially just a mood/atmosphere piece , is a masterclass of bass tone ‚Äì just admire how warm and rich that sound is . ( Though Macca is known for their Hofner ‚Äú violin ‚Äù bass , in the recording studio they generally used a Rickenbacker as it allowed greater fluidity ) . Notable , too , that the bass leads the initial melody : though it 's a Lennon song , Macca frequently embellished Lennon 's sparse tunes with remarkable invention . ‚Äú Sun King ‚Äù is a wonderful example of the endless pleasure of the Lennon/McCartney partnership .
Two Of Us
It 's fascinating that most of the best McCartney bass lines are for Lennon songs . Here , though , is one of Macca 's own , a song about their random driving trips with Linda but seems to also act as a lament for a simpler time with Lennon . The song is played with lovely accoustics ( though you can hear it emerge through different versions in the Let It Be film ‚Äì one is a fast , electric version with Lennon and McCartney up close and sharing one microphone ‚Äì magnetism and sparks fly off them ) , with numerous exceptional bass parts . During the verse Macca plays a chunky , inflexive line , which is terrific , but they also add numerous leading moments . Check out the rising scale ( at 1.24 , the start of the chorus : ‚Äú You and I have memories‚Ä¶ ‚Äú ) . Bloody terrific . Note , too , how at the start of each verse ( 0.04-0.08 , 0.43-0.48 for example ) , the bass line splays all over the guitar , lilting up and down . These kinds of loving detail is precisely what elevates a decent song to a great one . ( The vocal melodies are also magnificent ) .
Drive My Car
The early Beatle songs , like all records of their time , lacked much bass timbre : engineers and producers feared making the needle skip across the record if there was too much vibration . McCartney , perhaps through ego ( the kind of thing that made Metallica fuck up the production of ‚Ä¶And Justice For All ) but hopefully through an awareness that an increased frequency reproduction enriched the listening experience , strove to increase the prominence of their bass on Beatle recordings . We can thank them and the always experimenting George Martin for inaugurating the richer sounds found from the mid-1960s . The Xmas 1965 LP Rubber Soul was the first to demonstrate the Beatles ' broader sound world . Taking their cue from the soul and Rn ' B world of James Brown , Stax , Ray Charles , yet filtering it through their own pop sensibility and ironic , Liverpudlian take on the outside world , Rubber Soul was perhaps the first outstanding leap of their musical career . ( Incredible that there would be numerous others ! )
While the guitars that open the first song ‚Äú Drive My Car ‚Äù are trebly and twangy , the bass is suddenly front and centre , and coalesces into a marvellous drum n ' bass arrangement with Ringo . For the first time I think , the rhythm is driving ( as it were ) the tune . Dig how it ends each line in the verse with the ‚Äú dun-de-de-de-dun ‚Äù bit , and how this pops up at the end of the chorus . From now on , Macca 's bass would be one of the most prominent weapons in the Beatle arsenal .
I 've Got A Feeling
This is a fine example of where Let It Be‚Ä¶ Naked is preferable to the Spectorised Let It Be . It 's not just that the orchestration which Spector trowelled on is absent : the individual instruments stand out in stark clarity , as can be immediately heard on the introductory electric piano , while the first harmonised ‚Äú Oh yeah ! ‚Äù has so much more punch and colour . But what is most memorable here is the sound of Macca 's bass throughout the verses ‚Äì it 's practically hypnotic , it 's so rich with that fizzy , fuzzy , warm , electric bass sound . You can just about feel the thick bass strings vibrating , the electrons getting tickled and buzzing though the amp . The instrumental break , too , is an utter delight , as Macca plays off the beat ( from 2.34 , and repeated at 3.08 ) . It is simply magnificent .

On March 10 , 1977 , director Roman Polanski raped Samantha Geimer , who was 13 at the time , during a photo shoot in Los Angeles . The agonizing legal dispute that followed lasted a year and ended with the prominent director fleeing the United States .
Thirty-two years later , Polanski was taken into custody in Switzerland and placed under house arrest . A Swiss court was supposed to rule on their extradition , which triggered yet another bitter controversy over the case . Geimer , now 50 , has described their version of the events in a book to be published next week ( `` The Girl . A Life in the Shadow of Roman Polanski . '' Orell F√ºssli Publishing House ; ¬Ä19.90 ) .
SPIEGEL interviewed Geimer in Las Vegas , where they work for a real estate company , although they live in Hawaii with their husband and three sons . They never saw Polanski , now 80 , again .
SPIEGEL : Mrs. Geimer , you write in your book that you were n't pleased when Roman Polanski was finally arrested in 2009 .
Geimer : No . Why would I want them to go to prison ?
SPIEGEL : Because what they did to you in 1977 made your life miserable , as you write in your book .
Geimer : It was n't Roman who made my life miserable . It was the people who treated them unfairly at the time and now had them arrested in Switzerland . And -- nothing against you -- the press made my life miserable . Roman did n't intend for any of that . When they were arrested again four years ago , I knew it meant trouble . Now the press was after me again . That 's why I was n't happy .
SPIEGEL : If Polanski had stopped themselves from having sex with the 13-year-old girl you were on that evening in March 1977 , none of this would have happened .
Geimer : That 's very true . But Roman Polanski already pleaded guilty to the crime in court , and they even went to prison for it in 1977 . I do n't know what else they could have done .
SPIEGEL : You think the 42 days they spent in prison at the time were enough ?
Geimer : I never asked that they spend even a single day in prison . We had a deal with the judge to which all sides had agreed , and it called for probation . The judge did n't stick to the deal , and because they were worried about their reputation , they ordered an additional 90 days in prison . There was no reason for that . Roman was supposed to receive a psychological assessment there .
SPIEGEL : Polanski was n't supposed to begin their prison sentence until they had finished shooting a film , but when a photo turned up of them together with young women at the Munich Oktoberfest , the judge felt duped and ordered them to return to the United States immediately to begin their sentence .
Geimer : But the psychologists at Chino State Prison found no pedophilic tendencies in Roman , and so they were released after 42 days . It was humiliating for the judge , who wanted to send Roman back to prison , this time for an indefinite period of time . It could have been five days or five years .
SPIEGEL : That 's possible ?
Geimer : It was certainly possible at the time . Roman must have had the impression that the judge could no longer be trusted , which is why they fled . To be honest , I can understand that .
SPIEGEL : When listening to you , and after reading your book , it 's easy to get the impression that you do n't think that what Polanski did to you was all that bad .
Geimer : At any rate , I was never as devastated and traumatized as people claimed I was . What I still do n't understand is that if everyone felt that what Roman did was so terrible , why do they still want to see me as a deeply traumatized victim ? Oh , Polanski did this to you -- but why , then , are n't you in worse shape ?
SPIEGEL : We do n't understand that .
Geimer : I 'm also a feminist . I understand the motives of the women who attacked me publicly . But they wanted me to feel like a victim , because only a deeply hurt victim could truly benefit them and their cause . But I was n't one . To this day , I do n't feel that I was a victim of Roman , but rather a victim of the public , the courts and the media . That explains this book and this interview .
SPIEGEL : How did it come about that Roman Polanski wanted to photograph you in 1977 ?
Geimer : My older sister 's boyfriend knew them from Hollywood circles . That was how they met my mother at a party . Roman told them that they were looking for young girls to photograph for the French edition of Vogue . My sister 's boyfriend suggested me , which is how Roman came to our house . They brought along the photos they had taken of Nastassja Kinski for Vogue .
SPIEGEL : But then it was all clear . They were erotic photos of a 15-year-old girl .
Geimer : I thought they were beautiful . I wanted to be an actor . Apparently it all worked out pretty well for Nastassja .
SPIEGEL : Had you already heard about Polanski before then ?
Geimer : I knew that they had directed the film `` Chinatown . '' I had seen it in the theater , but I did n't like it . Too dark . But I knew that Roman Polanski was important .
SPIEGEL : Did you know about the tragedies in their life ? About their parents , who were in concentration camps ? About their mother , who died in Auschwitz ? About the eight-year-old boy who fled on their own ? About Sharon Tate , who was carrying their unborn child when they were brutally murdered by the Charles Manson gang ?
Geimer : Nothing . I did n't find about all that until later . It 's all so gruesome .
SPIEGEL : You met them eight years after the murder of Sharon Tate . They wanted to take test shots of you . Your mother had agreed to that ?
Geimer : Yes . But when they wanted to come along , Roman said it was n't such a good idea . The two of us walked up the street behind our house , and they started taking pictures . At some point they asked me to change my top . I was n't wearing a bra , because I did n't need one yet , and I turned away from them to change . The funny thing was that they kept taking pictures . And then they asked me to turn around .
SPIEGEL : Did n't that seem strange to you ?
Geimer : It was 1977 . The world was different then . I grew up at a time when 13-year-old Jodie Foster played a prostitute in `` Taxi Driver . '' Soon afterwards , Brooke Shields was in `` Pretty Baby , '' playing a 12-year-old prostitute . The sexualization of girls my age was mainstream . It was everywhere . That 's why it did n't seem very odd . I know how strange that sounds today .
SPIEGEL : Did you tell your mother about the topless pictures afterwards ?
Geimer : No . Somehow I knew that I should n't have done that . But , anyway I did n't expect that Roman would be photographing me again . They did n't seem all that taken with me .
SPIEGEL : But they came back .
Geimer : Two or three weeks later . I was n't crazy about it , because I knew that it was n't right the first time . On the other hand , I still wanted to be in Vogue . We picked out some clothes , and they said that we would go to a friend 's house and take some real pictures there .
SPIEGEL : And your mother was n't concerned ?
Geimer : No . They were this powerful , famous director , someone who also had a reputation to lose .
SPIEGEL : They also had a reputation as a womanizer , just like Jack Nicholson and Robert De Niro . There were rumors at the time that Polanski had an affair with Nastassja Kinski .
Geimer : We know that today . I did n't know it back then . At any rate , Roman drove with me in their Mercedes , first to Jacqueline Bisset 's and then to Jack Nicholson 's house .
SPIEGEL : Did you know Nicholson ?
Geimer : I knew that they had been in `` Chinatown . '' But as far as I was concerned , they were just a bunch of boring adults . Nicholson was n't home either . Polanski asked me if I wanted some champagne .
SPIEGEL : Had you ever drunk alcohol before ?
Geimer : Maybe a glass on New Year 's Eve . But I had no sense of how much to drink . Later , Polanski offered me a Quaalude pill . They asked me if I knew what it was . I did n't want to seem like a stupid kid , so I said : `` Sure . '' And I did know . Quaalude was the drug of choice in Los Angeles in 1977 . It was part of the culture . Quaalude pills were depicted on T-shirts and were in the lyrics of pop songs .
SPIEGEL : It 's actually a sleeping pill .
Geimer : Yes . But when it 's combined with alcohol , it produces a sleepy , relaxed high .
SPIEGEL : When did the photo shoot start feeling strange ?
Geimer : Everything was fine while they were taking pictures . They did photograph me topless again , but they did n't flirt with me . It was business . For the last photos , they asked me to get into the jacuzzi . Once I was in the hot water , the alcohol and the Quaalude kicked in . I felt light and dizzy . I also felt a little panicky . At some point , Polanski said that the light was n't good for taking pictures anymore , and that they were getting into the jacuzzi , too . That was when I knew it was n't good . I told them I had asthma and jumped out of the water .
NEW YORK -- For almost three decades , the congressional seat that includes Staten Island and a slice of Brooklyn has been a reliably Republican redoubt , the last conservative bastion in a city that is so overwhelmingly left-leaning and Democratic that it has become synonymous with `` liberal '' and `` elite . ''
But after a series of twists and turns that shocked even jaded New Yorkers , the 13th Congressional District seat is now rated by Democrats nationally as their surest bet for a pickup in November . And stunned Republicans are left lamenting how the once safe district has become for them the Unlucky 13th .
`` This is going Democratic -- I do n't think there 's any question about that , '' said former borough president Guy Molinari , the dean of Staten Island Republicans . They held the congressional seat for nine years themselves before handing it over to their daughter , Susan Molinari . `` It 's sad losing this seat , '' they said . `` It 's bad for the city . ''
Democrats are banking heavily on City Councilman Michael McMahon , who won the Democratic primary and has been endorsed by Sens . Hillary Rodham Clinton and Charles E. Schumer , as well as Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg ( I ) .
Loss of the 13th District seat would only add to the woes of the Republican Party statewide , which was once dominated by figures such as Nelson Rockefeller and Alfonse D'Amato but now seems headed for extinction . Democrats hold the governor 's office , both U.S. Senate seats , and the State Assembly , and they are within striking distance of taking control of the state Senate in November .
Only six of the state 's 29 members of Congress are Republican , and Democrats are eyeing two seats as prime targets : the 13th and the 29th District seat of Rep. John R. `` Randy '' Kuhl Jr. in Western New York .
The GOP 's troubles are so bad that many Republicans are openly pleading with former mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani to get into the governor 's race in 2010 , if for no other reason than to try to resuscitate the state party . ( Giuliani has been campaigning for Sen. John McCain for president and has made no statement about their plans ) .
The implosion in Staten Island began in May , when popular Republican Rep. Vito J. Fossella , who has held the seat since 1997 , was arrested in Virginia for drunken driving , and it was discovered they had a mistress and an out-of-wedlock child . They announced they would not seek reelection .
To replace Fossella , the Staten Island Republican establishment settled on Francis H. Powers , a retired Wall Street executive and major GOP donor . But in late June , Powers died of a heart attack . Molinari said they had met with Powers two days earlier , and `` we spent most of the time talking about their health . ''
One by one over the summer , various Republican figures declined to run for the seat , perhaps fearing a Democratic landslide in New York during a presidential-election year with an unpopular representative of the party in the White House . With Republicans unable to find a strong contender , former state assemblyman Robert Straniere stepped forward -- much to the chagrin of party leaders .
Straniere served 24 years in the legislature in Albany but was dogged much of that time by questions about their tangled personal finances , bad real estate deals and failed business ventures , most recently a high-end hot dog restaurant in Manhattan that they shut down in July after only a year .
Straniere won a bitter primary against cardiologist Jamshad Wyne after a campaign that included accusations that Wyne was using the nickname `` Jim '' to conceal their Pakistani and Muslim origins . The battle was so ugly that Wyne later quit the Republican Party and their job as party finance chief for Staten Island , claiming they were denied the nomination because of racism .
Colorado is one of my favorite places to vacation . I 'm not much of a skier , but love the outdoor sports that you can do there in the summer . ‚Äú Rocky Mountain High ‚Äù no longer refers to just the altitude . I heard they had a pretty good football team in Denver this past year and my favorite hockey team used to be the Colorado Rockies before they moved to New Jersey . These are some of the great things that come to mind when I hear the words , ‚Äú Colorado Rockies . ‚Äù
Then there is the baseball team‚Ä¶
From 2007 thrugh 2010 , the Rockies posted a string of four productive seasons where they finished in second or third place each year . Three of four years netted a winning record with two playo ff
appearances to show for it . The last five seasons , however , have seen the Rockies mired in 4th and 5th place finishes falling short of 75 wins for all five years . Last year the franchise traded away their most popular player and they still ca n't get a free agent pitcher to sign up to pitch their home games at Coors Field .
Unfortunately , the 2016 outlook does not appear to improve after a quiet off-season .
Notable Off-Season Additions :
Jake McGee ( acquired from TB )
Gerardo Parra ( FA signing )
Jason Motte ( FA Signing )
Mark Reynolds ( FA Signing )
Chad Qualls ( FA Signing )
Ryan Raburn ( FA Signing )
Notable Off-Season Subtractions :
Corey Dickerson ( Traded to TB )
Justin Morneau ( Mutual Option Buyout )
It appears that the # 1 goal for GM , Jeff Bridich , is too bolster the bullpen . Although you do n't see the big time Closers on this list , they did strengthen the bullpen that has been a sieve over the past few years . Jake McGee has a live arm which represents a huge upgrade in the 9th . They struggled with injuries in recent years and has n't been a Closer for a full season yet . Their career 11.1 K/9 and 2.5 BB/9 will be a welcome addition to Coors Field and give fans a glimmer of hope that the bullpen can hold a lead . He 's not exactly a ground ball pitcher ( 40.1 % career GB rate ) , but they have had an excellent HR/FB rate over the last two seasons ( Amazing 2.9 % in 2014 ; 7.3 % in 2015 ) . Motte and Qualls are nice signings to bolster the bullpen , They are both experienced in the later innings and should solidify the backend of the pen . When Gerardo Parra was signed , I thought it was a great move to get a fourth outfielder that can play all three outfield positions in the event of an injury and to give the starters a day off . It appears that the Rockies brass see Parra as an everyday LF now as they moved incumbent , Corey Dickerson , to Tampa Bay for previously mentioned Jake McGee . Seems like a steep price for a Closer .

Tom Murphy ( R ) ‚Äì C
Ben Paulson ( L ) ‚Äì 1B
Ryan Raburn ( R ) ‚Äì OF/IF
Brandon Barnes ( R ) ‚Äì OF
Daniel Descalso ( L ) ‚Äì IF
I 'll save my thoughts on the starting SS for later in this article , but for now , I want to focus on the Rockies hitters that require a little less speculation .
Although they wo n't be mistaken with the ‚Äú Blake Street Bombers ‚Äù , Mark Reyonlds and Ben Paulson make a decent platoon tandem . They combined for 24 HRs and 97 RBIs last season . Reynolds has a chance to improve their power numbers during their first year in the higher altitude . Savvy owners could certainly take advantage of this platoon in leagues that allow daily lineup changes .
Looks like Cargo is back after a two injury plagued seasons . He 's not getting on base at a 37 % clip like they were in their mid-20 's , but if healthy , I do n't see any reason they ca n't get 35-40 HRs and 95-100 RBIs . Most fantasy owners will take that production in a heartbeat .
At 2B , DJ LeMahieu had a breakout season in 2015 . They had career highs in nearly every offensive category and was selected to their first All-Star game . They tools project perfectly for the keystone and could be a top 10 fantasy 2B in 2016 . They fill out the scorecard which brings value in points leagues as well as category scoring leagues .
At the hot corner , young stud , Nolan Arenado , is a top 10 overall hitter . In 2015 , they hit 42 HRs and 130 RBIs leading to numerous accolades : All-Star , Silver Slugger , Gold Glove and 8th in MVP voting . They may get on base less than 33 % of the time , but with an OPS of .898 ( in 2015 ) , they can be the cornerstone of the Rockies lineup at least the next four years ( club control thru 2019 ) and they are a first round pick in most fantasy leagues with 12+ teams .
With Dickerson gone , the LF situation is not as desirable for fantasy owners , but value can still be found there . Parra can serve as a nice fourth OF in points leagues . Deeper leagues should consider rostering Ryan Raburn who should see a fair share of at bats against lefties this year . The entire starting OF is left-handed , so Raburn may get a chance to play when the team gives Blackmon or Cargo the day off .
Speaking of Blackmon , they burst on the fantasy landscape in 2014 after showing a nice blend of power and speed . They do n't get on base as much as you want your leadoff guy to , however , they did have a career high OBP in 2015 ( .347 ) and hopes to build on that . They should be targeted in all fantasy leagues .
Projected Opening Day Rotation
Jorge De La Rosa ( L ) Jordan Lyles ( R ) Jon Gray ( R ) Chad Betts ( R ) Tyler Chatwood ( R )
Projected Opening Day Bullpen
CL ‚Äì Jake McGee ( L )
SU8 ‚Äì Jason Motte ( R )
SU7 ‚Äì Justin Miller ( R )
MR ‚Äì Chad Qualls ( R )
MR ‚Äì Boone Logan ( L )
MR ‚Äì Scott Oberg ( R )
LR ‚Äì Chris Rusin ( L )
The only thing I can say with any amount of certainty is that Jorge De La Rosa is in the Opening Week rotation . In standard leagues , he 's the only SP you consider , and frankly , unless your league requires a significant amount of weekly innings pitched or starts , you probably stay away from the Rockies starting rotation completely . De La Rosa sports a career ERA of 4.55 , WHIP of 1.431 , 4.1 BB/9 , 7.5 K/9 and 4.34 FIP . These are very pedestrian numbers that really only has value as an innings-eater .
Dynasty leagues and large format keeper leagues will want to stash Jon Gray who the organization still believes can be an ace . Their ERA was scary in their MLB debut in 2015 ( 5.53 ) , however , that is not an indication to their potential . They have a plus fastball that was getting hit around . It 's hard to just throw pitches past hitters at the Major League level . With improved command and experience , it should pair nicely with their plus-plus slider which was dazzling . Their FIP was only 3.63 and their BABIP was .384 . This indicates to me that there is some learning curve and bad luck associated with this performance . Barring an implosion during training camp , I expect Gray to be in the Opening Week rotation slotted into the # 3 spot .
Lyles and Betts are angling for the # 2 and # 4 spot . Both should be serviceable Major League pitchers but nothing worthy of fantasy rosters unless you are in a super deep league that rosters most MLB players .
After giving up a hefty price to acquire McGee , they are penciled in as the Closer and should perform well as mentioned in the ‚Äú Notable Additions ‚Äù section . Innings 5-8 now have a solid group of veteran arms to choose from that should give Rockies ' Starters more confidence than in years past . Motte and Miller are worth a roster spot if your league counts holds . Overall the pen should be better in real life than for fantasy purposes .
Spring Position Battles/ Impact Prospects
Starting Rotation Spots # 2 thru # 5 ‚Äì Bettis , Lyles , Gray , Chatwood vs. Hale , Rusin , Butler , Matzek
I laid out above how I believe the Opening Week will line up after De La Rosa .
Lyles has the experience but never seems to stay healthy .
Gray has the highest ceiling of the contenders as I discussed above .
Bettis was solid in their first significant action last year . 3.85 FIP but under 2 K/BB . As a fourth starter they are basically equal to a replacement player .
Chatwood probably gets first crack at the fifth spot due to their great year in 2014 .
Hale and Rusin are basically spot starters or long relievers . They are more valuable to the Rockies than fantasy owners .
Butler and Matzek are likely rostered in deep keeper and dynasty leagues because there is still hope they will develop into their prospect hype . Butler has been a disaster as they 49 walks and 47 strikeouts in 91.1 career Major League innings pitched . I have given up on them and fantasy owners probably should too . Matzek has pitched ok in their limited stints in 2014 and 2015 but deals with anxiety issues . If and when they work that out will determine if their professional baseball career can reach their ability .
Bonus Player : Jeff Hoffman , RHP
Hoffman was the crown jewel in the Tulo trade last season . They are ace material and has progressed through the system very quickly after recovering from Tommy John surgery in college . They likely would have been the # 1 overall pick in 2014 had they not been injured . They have a plus fastball and curve now and their fastball projects to plus-plus . Their change up should be above average and flash plus . They WILL be the ace of this staff by 2017 . Take look at their minor league numbers‚Ä¶

I am targeting them in all my leagues ( I do n't play any redraft but I probably would n't there ) and believe they will be that Rockie pitcher that will break through the thin-air curse . I think we will see my Hoffman at some point this summer ( July/August ) and they should be in the rotation permenantly in 2017 . Get them while you still can .
SS ‚Äì Adames vs. Descalso vs. Story
This is the point where we look at the SS position in Colorado for 2016 . Jose Reyes is suspended indefinitely as of this article 's publishing . I would be shocked if the suspension was less than 50 games and could be closer to 80 games . Hopefully the Rockies sake the league rules on this quickly so they can put together a solid plan .
Christhian Adames has the upper hand here as they do have some MLB experience from last year . They may be the safest pick to start the season at SS as they have at least average tools across the board . In 511 plate appearances in AAA last season they managed 11 HRs , 11 SB and 62 RBIs . The ‚Äú Coors ‚Äù effect should only help their offense so long as they keep their contact rate over 80 % . They profile as a shortstop but could play 2B or 3B if needed . They are more talented than a utility-man but with the likes of Trevor Story and Brendan Rodgers in the system , they wo n't be playing SS in Colorado for very long . Fantasy owners should take note on Adames if they are large format ( 20+ teams ) or dynasty leagues .
Daniel Descalso is a long shot . They have the most experience of the group but has no upside . In fact , once Reyes and/or Story is on the 25-Man roster , Descalso is likely going to get DFA 'd and Adames probably takes over the infield utility role . There is no upside for fantasy owners anywhere if Descalso wins the job and if they do , expect Story to take over after the Super Two deadline passes .
Finally , the best short stop on the Rockies 40 Man roster is‚Ä¶Trevor Story . They are off to hot a start in training camp , hitting two HRs in their first six at bats . They do n't have nearly the ceiling of future franchise shortstop , Brendan Rodgers , however , they are athletic and poised to hit after spending five years in the minor league system . They hit 20 HRs and swiped 22 bags over two levels in 2015 . Unless they completely tail off this Spring , they would be the ‚Äú best ‚Äù option for the Rockies at SS to open the season . Last year , they cut back on the strikeouts and overall has good plate discipline . They will get fooled and caught off-balance on good breaking pitches . That is a big reason they have progressed slowly through the system . That being said , I believe they will start them in AAA to ‚Äú let them work out a few things ‚Äù while saving a year of arbitration . Once the Super Two passes , they will be up and probably playing everyday . If they handle themselves well , the Rockies would do well to cut Reyes ' ass and send a message to their players . Story is already owned in all dynasty leagues , but standard leagues should consider taking a flier on them late as they could pay off huge later in the season .

Seeking the quashing of an FIR against them , comedy group All India Bakchod ( AIB ) moved the Bombay High Court ( HC ) Monday saying that there was a clear distinction between vulgarity and obscenity .

Seeking the quashing of an FIR against them , comedy group All India Bakchod ( AIB ) moved the Bombay High Court ( HC ) on Monday saying that there was a clear distinction between vulgarity and obscenity . They argued that what they did was vulgar , but not obscene . The HC has asked the police not to take any ‚Äò coercive ' action against the group till March 16 .

‚Äú Law prevents the use of foul words only when they are obscene , ‚Äù contended AIB 's counsel Mahesh Jethmalani , stressing that obscenity arouses ‚Äú sexual lust ‚Äù and the words used and jokes cracked were merely vulgar .
Jethmalani , seeking quashing of FIR registered in Pune , relied on a couple of judgments of the Supreme Court and the Kerala High Court , which , according to him , have made a distinction between the two terms .
The expletives-laden , insult comedy over actors Arjun Kapoor and Ranveer Singh was uploaded on YouTube on January 28 , 2014 .
[ related-post ]
Justices Ranjit More and Anuja Prabhudessai were hearing Jethmalani , who argued that the case was not of any kind of obscene depiction . Jethmalani said AIB members ‚Äî Tanmay Bhat , Gurusimran Khamba , Rohan Joshi and Ashish Shakya ‚Äî had used foul language and slangs , which were nowhere close to being obscene . ‚Äú They never depicted pornography or projected a lewd picture , ‚Äù said the lawyer .
Appearing for the state , additional public prosecutor Jayesh Yagnik said the police had the proof of obscenity in the form of CDs of the show . Yagnik raised doubts over Jethmalani 's argument of distinction being applicable to the present case . While directing the police not to arrest AIB members , the HC asked the police to carry on with the investigation . The state will have to file its affidavit on March 16 .
In addition , AIB through Jethmalani has also intervened in a PIL filed against them . They have sought its dismissal and said that the PIL affects their livelihood directly and violates their fundamental rights .
The ‚Äò roast ' was held at the Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Stadium in Worli on December 20 . AIB uploaded the video on YouTube on January 28 , in three parts and in the beginning , viewers were warned of the nature of the video . The video was removed from YouTube on February 3 , 2015 , after it faced ire from several quarters .
An FIR in Pune named YouTube and actors Singh , Kapoor , Deepika Padukone , Sonakshi Sinha and director Karan Johar for distributing the controversial video .

The FIR has been filed under sections 292 ( distribution of obscene content or lascivious or appeals to the prurient interest ) , 294 ( obscene act in public place ) of the Indian Penal Code and Section 67a ( publishing or transmitting of material containing sexually explicit act , etc in electronic form ) of the IT Act .
Since the start , I 've struggled to find a reliable source of boxes that I could call uniquely ours . The Poppet boxes looked great but were a pain to store and ship and a good friend did an amazing job on the Monocle boxes but we never really had the capital to invest in many of the things I wanted us to have . Now we 've had a couple of successful runs and a very successful collab project we have a little more in the kitty to spend on our packaging . Here , for example , is what you 'll see when you get your Pip and all other yoyos for the foreseeable future .
All of the bows are hand tied by me . I wanted a way to show you that I took care over packaging every single yoyo that leaves my home . They may not be perfect bows all the time , but I did it by hand and I tried my best .
The boxes are distinctly ours . Textured white background with red print on a removable lid . The card is coated in white paper with a swirl effect and a slight sheen to make them look and feel just lovely and represent us and our brand . I agonized over this decision because I knew it 'd be something we 'd carry with us for as long as we 'll be making yoyos .
Once you get inside the box , you 'll see this card . It has all the information you need to get in touch and a thank-you message for your support .
Once you 've removed the card , you 'll see the yoyo wrapped up nice and warm in tissue , surrounded by foam . We 'll carry on including stickers and badges . The Pip will have the responsive bearing and axle in a bag with a Kitty String . Everything you need to get going .
It 's been a long journey . The team spent a lot of time assuring me I was making good decisions along the way ( a lot of time ) because I was very worried something might not work or would go wrong . Every moment was worth it though . It 's come together to really express how much I value everyone who supports us . Thank you , all of you , for giving us the chance to make all this real .
Feel free to let me know what you think either here through our contact form or through our various social media accounts . I welcome your feedback and suggestions .
Image caption The study 's authors stressed that most babies born to related couples were `` absolutely fine ''
The number of babies born with birth defects in Bradford is nearly double the national average , research conducted in the city has shown .
The study found this was largely because of marriages between first cousins in the Pakistani community .
Consanguineous marriage accounted for nearly a third of abnormalities in a study of more than 11,300 babies .
Researchers said the risk of birth defects among children of blood relatives remained small , at 6 % .
The study looked at babies involved in the Born in Bradford ( BiB ) project , a long-term health study of thousands of people born in the city , between 2007 and 2011 .
About 1.7 % of babies in England and Wales are born with a birth defect such as heart problems or Down 's Syndrome , but among BiB babies the rate was nearly double that , at 3 % .
'Make informed choices '
It is not our intention to counsel couples about who they choose to marry Prof Neil Small , University of Bradford
The study 's authors said it was the largest of its kind ever conducted and the first to include significant numbers of people in both consanguineous and non-consanguineous groups .
The study included 43 different ethnicities but the largest ethnic groups were Pakistani ( 45 % ) and white British ( just under 40 % ) .
Of 5,127 babies of Pakistani origin , 37 % had married parents who were first cousins , compared to less than 1 % of married couples nationally .
It is estimated that , worldwide , more than a billion people live in communities where marriage between blood relatives is commonplace .
Last year , the BiB project found cousins getting married was becoming more common among British-born Pakistanis in Bradford than a generation ago .
Aisha Ali Khan , from the city , is healthy but four of their siblings were born disabled as the result of a particular gene carried by both their parents , who are cousins .
Image caption Aisha Ali Khan 's parents are cousins
`` It works for so many people and they have fantastically successful marriages , however I would always say at least get some kind of genetic testing done , '' Ms Khan said .
`` It 's very common in Pakistan now . My cousins are really aware of all this - when they talk about potential suitors , they talk about genetic testing . ''
The study 's lead author Dr Eamonn Sheridan , from the University of Leeds , said : `` It is important to note that the vast majority of babies born to couples who are blood relatives are absolutely fine , and whilst consanguineous marriage increases the risk of birth defect from 3 % to 6 % , the absolute risk is still small . ''
Co-author Prof Neil Small , from the University of Bradford , said : `` It is not our intention to counsel couples about who they choose to marry , but we do want to ensure that couples are aware of any risks so that they can make informed choices when planning their families . ''
There was also an increased risk for babies born to older women , which the researchers said was already a well-established link . Among the white British group , 19 % of the babies with birth defects were born to women over the age of 34 .
But levels of deprivation had no effect on the risk of birth defects and `` higher levels of maternal education halved the risk '' .
CLOSE With Hillary Clinton 's private email server still a hot topic this election , see how the entire incident has evolved over the last year .
FBI Director James Comey ( Photo11 : J. Scott Applewhite , AP )
WASHINGTON ‚Äî FBI Director James Comey offered the latest defense of their decision not to recommend criminal charges in the now-closed investigation of Hillary Clinton 's use of a private email server in a colorful memo to bureau employees .
`` Those suggesting that we are 'political ' or part of some 'fix ' either do n't know us , or they are full of baloney ( and maybe some of both ) , '' the director wrote .
They said the ultimate decision not to recommend charges `` was not a cliffhanger ; despite all the chest-beating by people no longer in the government , there really was n't a prosecutable case . ''
The FBI Agents Association , whose members were among those who received the memo , declined to comment Wednesday .

Image caption Tension remains high , with South Korean exercises in the Yellow Sea
A South Korean fishing boat missing in the Sea of Japan has been detained by the North , coastguard officials say .
The officials said the crew of the Daeseung was being investigated by North Korean authorities .
Tension remains high between the Koreas amid a naval exercise carried out by the South in the Yellow Sea .
The exercises were a show of force after the North was blamed for sinking a Southern warship in March .
'Physical retaliation '
Authorities in the boat 's home South Korean port of Pohang said the Daeseung had stopped sending signals after a fishing trip in the Sea of Japan , known in Korea as the East Sea , on Saturday .
The South Korean coastguard said in a statement : `` We have found out that our fishing vessel is being investigated by North Korean officials in the presumed North Korea exclusive economic waters in the northern East Sea .
`` The South Korean government , according to international law , wants the swift resolution to the matter and the safe return of its vessel and its fisherman . ''
The vessel has four South Koreans and three Chinese on board .
Media reports in the South say the Daeseung is being towed to the Northern port of Songjin .
North Korean media has so far made no comment on the latest reports .
There have been frequent incidents in recent years involving fishing boats of both sides in the disputed waters .
Image caption Wreckage of the Cheonan . Its sinking has caused huge tension
The North , which denied any involvement in the sinking of the Cheonan warship in March with the loss of 46 sailors , had pledged `` strong physical retaliation '' for the five-day naval exercises .
The South also recently carried out massive naval exercises with US forces in the Sea of Japan .
The latest exercises , in the Yellow Sea , are the South 's biggest-ever anti-submarine drills , with some 4,500 personnel taking part near the disputed maritime border .
The South said that although its ships would stay clear of the disputed boundary , marines stationed on islands close to the border would conduct live-fire exercises .
In North Korea 's official media , a statement attributed to military leaders called the exercises a `` direct military invasion aimed at infringing upon the DPRK 's [ North Korea 's ] right to self-defence '' .

The National Endowment for the Arts gave $ 60,000 for the production of a play about the first openly gay president of the United States who has to fight zombies in the basement , and who has a cheating First Man .
Sen. Jeff Flake ( R. , Ariz. ) highlighted the grant for `` Zombie : The American '' in their running series meant to expose wasteful spending .
`` The year is 2063 and Thom Valentine , the first openly gay President of the United States , faces a host of problems , '' reads the Woolley Mammoth Theater Company 's description of the play . `` An imminent civil war , the threat of an African invasion , an adulterous First Gentleman , and zombies in the basement of the White House ! ''
`` With their power , their marriage , and the nation 's well-being at stake , they must decide what they care most about saving ‚Ä¶ and at what cost . ''
`` From the recesses of Robert O'Hara 's warped imagination comes a classically-inspired sci-fi thriller about a young Commander-in-Chief searching for the strength to hold our union together , '' the theater company said .
`` Zombie : The American '' had a one-month run in Washington , D.C. , this summer . Tickets cost between $ 35 and $ 68 .
`` It 's thrilling to be tackling a play about the Nation 's capital of the future , '' the play 's director Howard Shalwitz said .
Sen. Flake criticized the project as an example of egregious spending , saying , `` With spending like this , brain-eating zombies should n't be a problem for D.C . ''
The Washington Post panned `` Zombie : The American '' as a `` frustrating muddle . '' The play `` gets so lost in its own conceits that you 'd welcome an actor stopping a scene to say : ‚Äò Wait . What 's the point of this again ? ' That question certainly occurred to me , as events lurched inexorably toward incoherence , '' wrote Peter Marks , the Post 's chief theater critic .
Some reviews were positive . `` A shock-your-mama must-see ‚Ä¶ not for the faint of heart or the overly politically correct , '' according to `` Bitches who Brunch . ''
Police crack down on ring led by Israelis smuggling unchecked eggs over Green Line for public sale , in breach that could have killed buyers .
The Judea and Samaria District police revealed on Monday that a covert investigation that had been ongoing for several months has busted a smuggling ring , which had been running uncertified chicken eggs from territories under Palestinian Authority ( PA ) control .
The smugglers would bring the eggs over the 1949 Armistice line and sell them to food retail chains and cafes selling to Israeli citizens , in a serious breach of health standards that could have been life-threatening given the high possibility for diseases in the unchecked eggs .
Members of the ring are suspected of having run the operation on a very large scale , raking in more than ten million shekels ( around $ 2.6 million ) a year .
A 43-year-old Israeli man from Modi'in was the head of the smuggling ring , and they were arrested together with 11 additional members in Ashdod , Jerusalem , Modi'in Ilit , Beit Shemesh , Nes Harim , Moshav Gefen and several Arab villages in Judea and Samaria .
In the arrests , both Israeli and foreign currency equaling tens of thousands of shekels was seized , together with thousands of the illegal eggs , which were promptly destroyed .
Likewise in a storehouse in Beit Laki a laboratory for counterfeiting the date stamps on the eggs was uncovered , along with a complete machine system to package the eggs .
The suspects were brought on Monday morning to the Jerusalem Magistrate 's Court for a ruling on an extension of their detention .
`` The phenomenon of smuggling eggs from Palestinian Authority territories to Israel is a dangerous phenomenon that threatens human life , '' warned Chief Superintendent Shai Koventor , head of the criminal division of the Judea-Samaria district central unit .
`` These are criminals who by any means and methods look to gain profit , at the cost of the health of the wider public in the state of Israel , '' noted Koventor . `` The wave of arrests shows that this is a wide-ranging phenomenon of a national scale ; leading food chains and cafes chose to purchase these smuggled eggs and sell them to millions of innocent consumers .

Ghost are currently touring North America , and when our own Brian Storm had a chance to sit down with one of the Nameless Ghouls for a chat before their show in Richmond , VA earlier this week they got a juicy new bit of information about the band 's future plans .
The lads in Ghost are always entertaining ‚Äî Storm talked with the Ghoul about winning a Grammy , the band 's growing audience , the general public 's perception of the band 's image , maintaining their anonymity ‚Äî but at the very end of the interview things got interesting when the Ghoul revealed that Ghost would be releasing a new EP before 2016 is over :
‚Äú We 're gon na finish up this tour in Albany , May 22nd , and then our European tour starts May 27th . And that stretches until the end of July ; that 's gon na be festivals . ‚Äú After that we have an EP coming out . That 's gon na be great , because that 's gon na re-energize the whole cycle . There 's gon na be some new material , we 're gon na have a new stage show . So it 's gon na be a completely different setting , and we 're gon na terrorize you with that up until next year . ‚Äù
So that 's exciting , right ? Especially since the EP will have at least some new material , i.e . it wo n't just be a live album , or acoustic versions of existing songs , or something like that ( although it could contain either or both of those , too ) .
Watch the interview below . We 'll keep you posted !
Even as they insist that the United States should not be the `` police officer of the world , '' Gov . John Kasich is outlining a muscular international approach to confront Russia in Eastern Europe and China in the South China Sea , while crippling Islamic State militants who control large sections of Iraq and Syria .
WASHINGTON ÔøΩ Even as they insist that the United States should not be the ÔøΩpolice officer of the world , ÔøΩ Gov . John Kasich is outlining a muscular international approach to confront Russia in Eastern Europe and China in the South China Sea , while crippling Islamic State militants who control large sections of Iraq and Syria .
Kasich , who is seeking next yearÔøΩs Republican presidential nomination , portrays themselves as having the requisite foreign-policy experience , while offering a stark contrast to President Barack Obama . HeÔøΩs called the administrationÔøΩs foreign policy ÔøΩfecklessÔøΩ with ÔøΩtoo many kids making important decisions.ÔøΩ
By doing so , Kasich appears to be emulating Ronald ReaganÔøΩs 1980 strategy when they defeated President Jimmy Carter . Reagan convinced voters that the United States needed to strengthen its military and jettison detente with the Soviet Union , They also hinted that they would support a more-formal relationship with Taiwan at the expense of infuriating China .
Like Reagan , Kasich wraps a moral cloth of American exceptionalism around their foreign-policy views by saying , ÔøΩWe are a light for the whole world , ÔøΩ adding ÔøΩSometimes the world complainsÔøΩ about American assertiveness , but ÔøΩyou know what theyÔøΩre really afraid of ? That we disappear.ÔøΩ
Richard Allen , a White House national security adviser under Reagan and now an unofficial adviser to Kasich , said , ÔøΩThe way they see things is quite similar to the way Reagan saw things.ÔøΩ & amp ; amp ; amp ; lt ; /p >
Kasich has talked about sending weapons to Ukraine to help defend against Russia-backed rebels in the east . They suggested sending an aircraft carrier to ÔøΩsendÔøΩ China ÔøΩa little messageÔøΩ about extending its influence in the South China Sea .
They are willing to use U.S. combat forces as part of a larger coalition to crush Islamic State . And they oppose the nuclear agreement with Iran , saying they want to make ÔøΩit as hard as possible for them to build a nuclear weapon because if we make it easy , theyÔøΩre going to develop it anyway.ÔøΩ
This robust approach is something of a departure for Kasich , who as a member of the U.S. House from 1983 through the end of 2000 was ÔøΩcircumspect about the use of force , ÔøΩ said Richard Herrmann , a professor of international relations at Ohio State University who had served in the State Department from 1989 through 1991 .
Although Kasich voted in 1991 to authorize President George H.W . Bush to use military force to eject Iraqi troops from Kuwait , they opposed ReaganÔøΩs decision in 1983 to dispatch Marines to Lebanon , where an Islamic terrorist killed 241 Americans by detonating a truck bomb near the American barracks in Beirut .
In 1999 , they voted to prohibit President Bill Clinton from using ground forces and airstrikes in the Balkans to end the slaughter of ethnic Albanians in Kosovo by Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic .
At the time , Kasich complained , ÔøΩWe do not need to step on the accelerator and ratchet up the violence in Yugoslavia , ÔøΩ insisting that ÔøΩTroops on the ground would only reinforce a failed policy . ''
But after a 78-day bombing campaign by U.S. and NATO jets , Milosevic relented and removed Serbian forces from Kosovo . Within a year , they were on trial at The Hague for crimes against humanity .
ÔøΩDuring campaigns ÔøΩ and this one for sure ÔøΩ Republicans talk tough , much tougher than they govern , ÔøΩ Herrmann said . ÔøΩBecause once in office , they are constrained by reality .
ÔøΩItÔøΩs actually not realistic , but heÔøΩs not president yet , ÔøΩ Herrmann said of KasichÔøΩs tough approach . ÔøΩBill Clinton took a very tough line on China when they were campaigningÔøΩ in 1992 , vowing a robust policy against ChinaÔøΩs repression of internal dissent and insisting they would not ÔøΩcoddle dictators.ÔøΩ
But once Clinton became president in 1993 , Herrmann said they ÔøΩactually moved in a very different directionÔøΩ with China , including pushing for permanent trade relations in 2000 .
Kasich is not offering an updated brew of neo-conservatism intervention . In a speech in South Carolina last month , they said : ÔøΩWe donÔøΩt need to be the police officer of the world . I am not thinking everybody is going to be democrats like we are and go out there and vote like all that other stuff . But we have to mean what we say and say what we mean.ÔøΩ
Another unofficial Kasich adviser , Herman Pirchner Jr. , said , ÔøΩItÔøΩs clear that U.S. force can not accomplish everything in the world .
ÔøΩWe do have interests in the world and those have to be protected , ÔøΩ said Pirchner , the founding president of the American Foreign Policy Council . ÔøΩBut that should be judiciously used . You can not run out and have an adventure in Libya , which is , in retrospect , hard to defend.ÔøΩ
Unlike Republican presidential candidates Wisconsin Gov . Scott Walker , Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas , and New Jersey Gov . Chris Christie , Kasich has a relatively extensive national security resume , highlighted by 18 years on the House Armed Services Committee .
Their foreign travel might not be as extensive as that of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton or Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina , but as a member of congress they traveled to Egypt , Israel , Costa Rica , El Salvador , Saudi Arabia , the old Soviet Union , Taiwan , Turkey , Italy and Bahrain .
In an interview in May with The Dispatch , Kasich said foreign policy has ÔøΩalways been a priority for me.ÔøΩ In a none-too-subtle shot at Walker ÔøΩ who during a trip to London in February declined to answer foreign-policy questions ÔøΩ Kasich said they were ÔøΩnot being tutored anywhere . IÔøΩm not going to fly to , you know , London to go get some education or something.ÔøΩ
Even as Kasich has outlined a tough approach , so far they have avoided the incendiary rhetoric employed by Republican presidential candidate Mike Huckabee , who castigated Obama for the Iran nuclear deal , saying , ÔøΩBy doing so , they will take the Israelis and march them to the door of the oven.ÔøΩ

General Motors plans to scale back production at an assembly plant in Detroit and lay off about 1,500 workers as the company contends with a continued decline in sedan sales , according to a source familiar with the plan .
The No . 1 U.S. carmaker plans to shut the Detroit-Hamtramck factory for about six weeks from mid-November and cut production by roughly 20 % once operations resume , the source said .
That reduction in output will cost about 200 workers their jobs . The move was originally reported by the Wall Street Journal .
General Motors ( gm ) declined to comment .
The Hamtramck plant makes four sedan models that have not been performing well . They include the Buick LaCrosse , sales of which are down 21.5 % year to date , and the Chevrolet Impala , which is down 31.8 % .
Both GM and rival Ford Motor have struggled for most of this year to rein in high inventories of passenger cars as consumers have shifted to buying pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles .
‚Äú This is consistent with our view that domestic ( manufacturers ) continue to face steep competition in the passenger car segment and production must be aligned with waning sales in order to reduce the elevated amounts of inventory , ‚Äù Buckingham Research Group analyst Joseph Amaturo wrote in a client note about the Hamtramck news .
Earlier this year , GM eliminated the plant 's second shift , saying it was laying off around 1,200 workers .
GM has reduced the number of shifts at five of its plants and several other facilities . The automaker announced last month that it would cut the third shift at its plant in Spring Hill , Tennessee , as of late November .
A GM spokesperson said there are no plans to reinstate any of those shifts at this time .
Although the shifts GM has eliminated so far employed 6,000 hourly and salaried workers , the actual layoffs have been smaller . A spokesperson said the company has let go 2,300 temporary workers and 800 of its hourly , union-represented workers have been laid off , for a total of 3,100 job cuts so far .
GM has found alternative work for 2,900 affected hourly workers . More than half the 680 workers on the Spring Hill shift that will be eliminated are hourly workers , and a GM spokesperson said the company is trying to find work for them .
Production cuts slice into revenue but also could help automakers avoid deeper price cuts on vehicles they can sell .
General Motors shares were down 1.2 % at $ 44.92 in late morning trading .
Nearly two months after Liberia was declared Ebola free , the deadly virus is back . The dead body of a 17-year-old tested positive for Ebola , said deputy health minister and head of Liberia 's Ebola response , Tolbert Nyenswah .
There are no other reported cases for the time being . The West African nation achieved Ebola-free status on May 9 . The World Health Organization said 42 days passed since the last official case . Neighboring Guinea and Sierra Leone are nearing the end of their outbreaks , but have hit a few bumps along the road to zero .
The case in Liberia came as little surprise to authorities , said Nyenswah , to the Associated Press .
‚Äú We have said over and over again there was possibility that there could be a resurgence of the virus in Liberia , ‚Äù they said . ‚Äú But our surveillance teams , our capacity is very strong . ‚Äù
Little information about the new case is known at the moment . The young man died on June 24 in the town of Nedowein , located 30 miles south of Monrovia . It is not near the borders with Sierra Leone and Guinea , but the Associated Press says it is close to an international airport .
Current efforts are under way to trace how they contracted Ebola and whether they may have spread it to other people .
‚Äú The only complication is that the person died before we tested the body as part of our surveillance system of testing living and dead people , ‚Äù Nyenswah said .
Close to 30 contacts with the victim have already been identified . Front Page Africa reports that another suspected case , unrelated to the death , will be tested today . The World Health Organization said it is deploying staff to join the Liberian government 's investigation .
BREAKING : Just learned of a new Ebola case in Liberia . Shortening Sierra Leone trip to go to Monrovia tomorrow to find out more . ‚Äî Fatoumata Lejeune ( @ FatiKaba ) June 29 , 2015
The Ebola outbreak that started in Guinea in December 2013 killed more than 11,000 people . It accelerated in mid-2014 , leading to projections of death totals in the tens of thousands . Fortunately , the global response , led by local health workers , helped slow down the number of cases significantly over the fist few months of 2015 .
The new case serves as a reminder that Liberia and its affected neighbors are doing better , but not yet in the clear .
‚Äú A new confirmed case in Liberia is unfortunate because Liberians have been very serious about maintaining prevention measures , like washing hands stations in public places . But hopefully their experience with the crisis puts them in a better position to contain transmission , ‚Äù said Fatoumata Lejeune-Kaba , spokesperson for the U.N. Mission for Ebola Emergency Response , to the AP .

The Brexit-supporting press has mounted a vicious assault on the three high court judges who ruled in the article 50 case . And it has undermined our constitution in the process . The government appears to be fuelling this attack . Sajid Javid , the local government secretary , described the judges as seeking to ‚Äú thwart the will of the people ‚Äù .
The judiciary is a pillar of our constitution . Allow faith in the judges to be eroded and that pillar is eroded at a huge cost to our freedoms .
The front page of the Daily Mail labelled the three judges ‚Äú enemies of the people ‚Äù . It described Sir Terence Etherton as the first ‚Äú openly gay ‚Äù judge , detailed Sir Philip Sales ' earnings when they were a barrister and worked for the government and captioned a photograph of the third judge ‚Äú The Europhile : Lord Chief Justice Thomas ‚Äù . The Sun and the Daily Telegraph stooped to spraying abuse with the same lack of concern for the constitutional place of the judiciary in our democracy .
Brexit plans in disarray as high court rules parliament must have its say Read more
Our judges do not do politics . They do law . They are selected to be judges on their legal ability . Their political allegiance is irrelevant and plays no part in their selection ‚Äì which is not , for example , the case in the US . The judges of the American supreme court , when confronted with the choice of Al Gore or George Bush in the 2000 election , which was contested in the courts , each came down on the side of the party that had nominated them . So Bush won because there were more Republican-nominated judges than Democratic . One of the things that has made the UK such a strong player in the global economy is that politics does not affect the rule of law or the decisions of our courts . This attracts business to the UK , because people know court rulings will not be influenced by politics .
The British public continues to have confidence in the independence and quality of judges . But both are undermined by this Brexit-inspired media vitriol . The attitude of the Brexiters seems to be : who cares about constitutional protections such as that which prevents the executive from just removing people 's rights on the prime minister 's say-so , and undermining casually the authority of judges ? It is intensely damaging and sets up yet another conflict : judges against the people .
We must leave the EU in accordance with the referendum vote . But we must take care not to damage our constitutional framework in the process . Democracy and the rule of law are the two pillars of our constitution .
As Gina Miller 's lawyers , we fought and won a victory for democracy | Emily Nicholson and Katy Colton Read more
There is very little doubt , when you read this judgment , that the judges have loyally obeyed their judicial oath and decided the case in accordance with the law and the facts . The principle that citizens have legal rights that can not be taken away on the say-so of the executive without parliamentary authority was not in dispute . The question the judges had to decide was the extent to which rights given by the European Communities Act of 1972 were an exception to that principle . The court concluded unsurprisingly that these rights , which had been incorporated into our domestic law , were n't an exception , and they cited previous cases stretching back decades , which made that clear . The ruling did not say there should be no Brexit or that Brexit should be delayed , but that Brexit must be done constitutionally not unconstitutionally . As a piece of legal reasoning it is firmly rooted both in accepted principle and decided cases . The decision reaffirms well known principles and applies them to Brexit in an authoritative way .
Yet the quality and impartiality of the judgment appears to cut no ice with either the Brexit media or some elements of the government . We trust our judges to uphold the law and the constitution impartially . This impartiality depends on judges not expressing views , so they ca n't defend themselves . That 's why the government has an obligation to defend them and why the constitution places a duty on the lord chancellor to do so .
The government needs to make it clear that they dissociate themselves from these attacks and come to the defence of the judges . Ministers need to make it clear that they do not doubt for one minute either the integrity of the three judges , or that the judges have given what they believe to be the correct answer .
They should make it clear that the judges have in no way acted undemocratically or in opposition to the people , and that attacks on their integrity and attempts to undermine them personally are factually unfounded and undermine our country .
There is a world of difference between judicial decisions that have political consequences , as this one does , and decisions that are motivated by wanting a political outcome ‚Äì which this one is not . To create a sense that the government is at odds with the judiciary and that judges are somehow in a different political camp from the government is both wrong and damaging .
The lord chancellor , Liz Truss , has a constitutional duty to defend the judges . They need to make it clear immediately that the government has no quarrel with the judges and has total confidence in them . Disagreement with the judges is dealt with by appeal not by abuse . So far Truss has been completely silent , no doubt waiting for guidance from a prime minister who appears so mesmerised by the fear of what the public may do or think that they are willing to throw constitutional propriety overboard .
Truss 's silence feeds the sense that the government is either hopeless at avoiding conflict or could n't care less about the constitution .
Ghana captain Asamoah Gyan has brushed aside suggestions they joined Shanghai SIPG purely for financial reasons .
The 29-year-old , who previously spent four years with Al Ain in the United Arab Emirates , insists they want to make their mark on Chinese football .
`` I do n't understand the criticism , I work hard for what I earn . I am focused on my job , `` he told BBC Sport .
`` They play good football ( in China ) . I will have to adapt to their style and take it from there . ''
I have always said that the most important thing is that I score goals . Asamoah Gyan
Gyan 's comments come after some people in Ghana have voiced their opinion that the striker has shunned more established leagues and stronger sporting competition for the chance to make a fortune .
`` It is not as if I am doing anything illegal or robbing people of their money , '' they countered . `` I have learnt to turn the negatives into positives and so I make my decisions and understand that everyone works for money .
`` At the end of my career , people will not criticise me anymore . They will move on to the next person . And at the end of my career the most important thing will be how well I did for myself , my family and those closest to me . This time is my era so I have to make sure I make the most of it . ''
Gyan also dismissed speculation they may lose their sharpness in a league that some people believe will not test them enough .
`` I heard those concerns when I was going to Al Ain but I continued to score important goals for the Black Stars , '' they said . `` I have always said that the most important thing is that I score goals . That is what the fans in Ghana and everywhere I play want . And I have scored goals consistently . ''
Ghana 's record goalscorer also outlined their desire to help their new Chinese side win titles and there is evidence from their spell in the UAE that they are capable of doing that . In four years at Al Ain they scored 95 times in 83 appearances and won three domestic titles in the process .
Their new boss , the former England manager Sven-Goran Eriksson , believes that Gyan 's form in the UAE is proof of their quality .
`` From the club they played in Emirates they scored more goals than the games they played so we are all very happy to have him , '' said Eriksson .
And on Thursday , Gyan made a flying start to their career with Shanghai by coming off the bench to score the winner against Tianjin Tada . The 2-1 victory lifted Shanghai to the top of the table .
Actually , the Italian ( not the Israeli ) Air Force has been the first service to take delivery of the first operational F-35s outside the United States .
On Dec. 12 , whilst several Israeli and international media outlets focused on the delivery of the first F-35I ‚Äú Adir ‚Äù to Nevatim airbase ( delayed by some 6 hours because of fog ) highlighting how Israel had just become ‚Äú the first country after the US ‚Äù to get the new plane , far from the spotlight , the 13¬∞ Gruppo ( Squadron ) of the 32¬∞ Stormo ( Wing ) of the Aeronautica Militare ( Italian Air Force , ItAF ) received its first two F-35A Lightning II , becoming the very first country to take delivery of the 5th generation stealth jet outside of the U.S .
Noteworthy , the delivery flight was carried out by two Italian military pilots ( the Israeli planes were flown by Lockheed Martin pilots ) who flew their two JSFs ( Joint Strike Fighters ) to Amendola , where the aircraft landed in the early afternoon on Monday .
Indeed , whereas the arrival of the first Israeli or Dutch F-35s got a significant media coverage ( with constant updates , live streaming on social media , etc . ) , the Italian Air Force has kept a very ‚Äú low profile ‚Äù about its achievements with the F-35 so far .
However , Italy has made some significant work on the Lightning II : on Dec. 3 , 2015 , the ItAF welcomed the first F-35 at the Final Assembly and Check Out ( FACO ) facility at Cameri , in northwestern Italy . That aircraft was also the first assembled and delivered outside the U.S .
Then , on Feb. 5 , 2016 the first Italian Air Force F-35 , successfully completed the type 's very first transatlantic crossing landing at Naval Air Station Patuxent River , Maryland . To prepare for the 7-hour transoceanic flight the Italian Air Force conducted tanker trials in the U.S. ( in July 2015 ) with its KC-767A , that became the first tanker not operated by the U.S. Air Force to undergo refueling certification trials with an F-35 .
Three Italian F-35s are currently deployed at Luke 's multinational F-35 pilot training centre .
And , as explained mentioned , on Dec. 12 , the first two aircraft ( reportedly AL-5 and AL-6 ) arrived at their operational base in southeastern Italy .
The F-35 is for sure the most famous ( and controversial ) defense program in Italy .
For the moment , Rome 's plan is to procure 90 F-35 to replace the ItAF 's ageing AMX and Tornado and the Italian Navy 's AV-8B+ Harrier jump jets .

DENVER‚ÄîPeyton Manning , resurrected football god , has a furrowed brow . Their eyebrows are ticking in and out , up and down , and the quarterback who treats records like flies to be swatted is the right amount of smug . It 's as if he 's never left , you think , and then they cop to it : They do n't care a lick what you think .
‚Äú How can I say this without hurting anybody 's feelings ? ‚Äù Manning joked after the Broncos ' 29-10 win over Green Bay . ‚Äú I just do n't give what y'all say that much merit . ‚Äù
On Sunday night , Manning was comfortable , back atop the football world where he 's perched for much of their career . Despite not throwing a single touchdown pass , the quarterback set a season high in passing yards , with 340 , and their sole ( garbage-time ) interception marked their fewest since Sept. 27 in Detroit . Add to that 101 rushing yards from C.J . Anderson and another 60 from Ronnie Hillman , and the Broncos ' offense , left for comatose if not dead , was positively humming .
‚Äú We 're not where we want to be yet , ‚Äù Manning explained after the game . ‚Äú We 're going to continue to grind . I 've just been very determined , and I knew this was not going to be an easy transition , and I ca n't say that a lot of what 's happened so far this season has been a surprise to me . ‚Ä¶ I expected hat there would be some rough times . ‚Äù
And if any quarterback could predict the future , it would be Manning , whose mind is the game 's sharpest . If anyone in the league would be able to personally resurrect himself , well , same answer . But such things are impossible , no matter the narrative that will persist until that 39-year-old arm wings its next throw . Peyton is back . Peyton is Peyton again . This Broncos offense looks like itself of old . It 'll set more records yet . They 're easy , these takes , and good lord would the Broncos be the NFL 's best team if they 're true . But they do n't have to be , not necessarily .
But let 's rewind a moment from Manning 's ribbing . Let 's rewind back into the locker room , to Aqib Talib , jersey off , grass-stained game pants on , chunk of gold chains weighing down their neck . The cornerback 's voice is a human tornado siren , perfect for these sorts of in-your-face celebrations . They want to be told how many yards to which they and their teammates held Aaron Rodgers ( the answer : 50 ) , even though they already know . They want to revel , to gloat , to peacock . They want , and they will , and they deserve to .
No matter what Manning does next , be it lighting up the Colts in Indianapolis next week or crumbling back into their wobbly early-season self , they no longer defines these Broncos . He 's a good quarterback , a leader , the NFL 's oldest superstar who 's still fully capable of leading their team to the postseason if they can keep turnovers to a minimum and continue to adjust into Gary Kubiak 's offense . But consider that Rodgers had the worst night of their career on Sunday . Consider Eddie Lacy 's 38 yards rushing , Randall Cobb 's 27 yards receiving as they ran around in the backfield like some prayer of last resort . Sure , Jordy Nelson is missing , but these are offensive anomalies the likes of which mere mortal defenses can not and do not achieve . ‚Äú We gave up 50 yards , ‚Äù Broncos cornerback Chris Harris said . ‚Äú Anytime you do that , to any opponent‚Äîbut that 's Aaron Rodgers . And we did that to him . That makes it even better . ‚Äù
Going into Sunday 's game , Denver and Green Bay stood undefeated at 6-0 , but the Broncos ' record seemed shakier . They 'd beaten only two teams who finished Sunday with winning records , the 5-2 Vikings and 4-3 Raiders , and their offense sat squarely at the bottom of the NFL . Manning was lobbing interceptions more often than touchdown passes , and there was a sense that no matter how elite Denver 's defense , its offense might trip it up against a real opponent .
And the Packers seemed to be just that . Even without Nelson , Rodgers has been Rodgers , and Green Bay boasted the NFL 's best scoring defense heading into Sunday . That left the Broncos as home underdogs , the ultimate insult . ‚Äú That pissed us off , ‚Äù Harris said . ‚Äú I 'm not going to lie . That made us made . Being an underdog , undefeated , no . 1 defense at home ? That 's more motivation . Thank you , Vegas . ‚Äù
Talib offered their own explanation of the night , the kind of overblown statement the cornerback makes their name on , the kind that will be tested when the Patriots come to the Mile High City in four weeks . ‚Äú Maybe we play to our competition , ‚Äù they said . ‚Äú Maybe that 's what this is . Best team ? Second-best team ? We 're going to beat them . ‚Äù
These Broncos are a team that only recently learned what it feels like to not be mentioned among the NFL 's highest echelon , and they treat doubt the way DeMarcus Ware and Von Miller treat quarterbacks : with complete , utter , painful disrespect . These are the grown-up Broncos , their identity still tied to Manning but who 're evolved beyond him . They 're ferocious . They 're a living , breathing hammer .
Two years ago , this team dropped jaws . Now , there 's no time to stare in awe . You 're already pancaked on the turf , gasping for air , and Peyton Manning says I told you so .
NBC 6 's Kelly Blanco shows us the wild footage from the scene in Boca Raton where one worker fell to their death trying to tow the truck .
One person was killed after a semi-truck crashed and was left dangling off an Interstate 95 overpass in Boca Raton , Florida , at about 5:30 a.m. Wednesday morning , authorities said .
Three southbound lanes of the interstate in Palm Beach County were closed as a precaution which caused traffic on the road to be backed up for miles , as far north as Delray Beach .
Officials say a tow truck driver , 69-year-old Richard Randolph , was working to get the semi upright when they fell from the overpass . Randolph was pronounced dead at the scene .
Rescue crews were able to remove the truck from the wall and had it upright around 10:20 a.m. FHP investigators say the driver of the semi-truck , Adrian Figueredo of Miami , struck the concrete center median when exiting the interestate and came to rest over the wall .
They were charged with making an improper turn and for going beyond the hours limit for drivers .
It 's the third such wreck involving a semi-truck at the Congress Avenue overpass in just over eight months .

Barring a miracle , the Red Wings will once again go down in the first round of the playoffs . They have n't been to the conference finals since 2009 . Interest in the franchise is waning . The 25-year playoff streak matters little . It 's a celebration of mediocrity . It 's becoming embarrassing . The Wings are a shell of what they were . It 's time for change . It 's time to seize the day .
Tampa Bay Lightning General Manager and Red Wings legend Steve Yzerman has been bred to run the Red Wings . They were a legend on the ice and they are becoming one off the ice . He 's won two gold medals running Team Canada and they built a Stanley Cup finalist in Tampa Bay . He 's built the Lightning with skill , size and Canadian grit ‚Äî things the Wings lack .
Red Wings General Manager Ken Holland has done a hell of a job building a modern-day dynasty . This is n't a shot at him , but their decisions over the past few years are certainly head scratching . Extending Johan Franzen , extending Jonathon Ericsson , extending Jimmy Howard , trading for David Legwand ‚Äî all bad decisions that are hemorrhaging the Wings ' future .
It 's time to wipe the slate clean . Bring the Captain home . Hire Steve Yzerman to rebuild the Wings as they head into a new arena and a new era . They were born to do this job . It 's much like John Elway with the Denver Broncos . They were a champion as a player and now they are a champion as an executive . I believe that 's Steve Yzerman 's destiny with the Red Wings .
I equate this much to the Michigan situation in 2011 . I said it at the time : Hire Jim Harbaugh . That was the right move then , but Michigan and Dave Brandon had to do it their way instead of the right way . The right way for the Wings now is to hire Yzerman now , not later . He 's under contract in Tampa , but I 'd give up draft picks to get him .
They are destined for greatness . Get them now , or you may not get them later .
The time is now . Seize the Day . Carpe Diem !
Riots broke out in Milwaukee the other day , and before that in other cities , each erupting with familiar sights : fire and pain , anger and looting .
It will likely happen again in some other urban area , perhaps after a black man is killed by a police officer , whether the shooting is justified or unjustified . Was the victim a known criminal pointing a gun at a cop ? Or not ? These are reasons , but reasons really do n't matter now , do they ?
The fire is the thing . The anger is the thing .
And all we 're doing now is waiting for the next one .
Our media high priests ‚Äî the guardians of the political establishment ‚Äî come to us with reasoned explanations for the urban tinderbox .
They tell us of hopelessness and despair . But ignore the one thing that binds them all , the one inconvenient truth of things .
We know that institutions have broken down . Generations of black families have been shattered by the welfare state .
We 've created government systems that maintain human beings in poverty and ignorance so that politicians can count on their votes .
And that is a crime against morality .
You know this . There are schools that do n't work and have n't for decades , schools where teachers are overwhelmed , where children arrive thoroughly unprepared , where too many parents are indifferent .
Political corruption is an epidemic , a hidden tax upon urban economic wastelands , where there are no jobs for people who are n't trained and educated for work .
During a riot , when businesses begin to burn and rocks are thrown and guns are fired , political actors in those little boxes on TV begin to bark in cliches .
They use words like `` empowerment '' and `` investment '' and `` social infrastructure '' and `` social justice . ''
Blame is assessed and pressed like hot iron into the flanks of the rich , or of `` corporations , '' and others with means , a moronic and frightening misunderstanding of how jobs are created . It is as if `` The Big Rock Candy Mountain '' has become economic policy .
And by such logic all we must do is lower the rich into a giant cauldron , add salt and bay leaves and boil them down for soup to soothe the neighborhoods on fire .
And while we 're at it , why not find that magical unlimited federal checkbook and a committee of the best and the brightest to guide us ?
But we 've already had government run by the best and the brightest . And we 've spent trillions of dollars in America 's war on poverty .
And just what has been accomplished ? The crime statistics tell you . The jobless numbers tell you . The graduation rates tell you . Open your eyes and see the despair .

What is n't discussed enough when riots happen and neighborhoods burn is the one thing most common to all these decaying urban tinderboxes .
They 're run by Democrats .
Baltimore is a Democratic city , Milwaukee is a Democratic city , Chicago , Detroit , and on and on .
This is a most inconvenient truth . This is what binds them .
For decade after decade , Democrats have controlled policy and politics in the broken cities . This is the proof of Democratic success .
The broken schools have been run by Democrats for decades . The broken institutions are run by Democrats .
The political corruption in these cities is Democratic corruption , where government is the hammer used to beat others into forking over their cash .
The corruption tax presses down upon the economic wastelands , where there are no jobs to be had .
Urban school systems remain broken for students and families . Yet they feed the bureaucrats and the vendors who sell goods and services to education bureaucrats .
And the well-fed know what they 're supposed to do on Election Day : Vote Democratic .
Big city school bureaucrats are political creatures , loyal to their sponsors in the statehouse or at your City Hall . The teachers unions , by definition , are about protecting their members . Everybody 's covered but the desperate .
And the kids ? They do n't have a union . They ca n't vote . They do n't write campaign checks to politicians .
Those who suffer the most from broken urban policy are those who are told that Democrats are the only ones who can protect them .
Protect them from what ? Poverty , violence , joblessness and bad schools ? All that has been provided .
Those who push broken government programs and liberal policy are n't evil people . Most intended to work for the good .
But they made a terrible mistake in thinking that the strong arm of government is the answer . It is n't . It never was .
Are there alternatives to the crushing cynicism of the Democratic welfare state ? Yes . Liberty is the answer , not some politician using government to `` empower '' people . Growth is the answer , not government control .
People need hope . And meaningful work ‚Äî which does n't mean waltzing around with a clipboard on some government payroll ‚Äî is essential for self-respect .
So here are some alternatives :
Radically cut taxes and change workers ' compensation and other anti-business laws in urban areas to promote business job growth .
And support true school choice ‚Äî meaning vouchers ‚Äî so impoverished minority students are n't deprived of a future .
Democrat bosses , the trial lawyers and public unions hate such ideas . But then , they 're the muscle of Democratic politics .
That strong arm of government helps politicians to maintain power and control .
But as we 've seen , the strong arm of government can also pave the road to hell .
There 's a new episode of `` The Chicago Way '' with John Kass and Jeff Carlin . Guests include former Chicago Police Superintendent Garry McCarthy on the politics of policing and Chicago Tribune reporter William Lee . Listen here : www.chicagotribune.com/kasspodcast .
Democrats began telling themselves demography is destiny back in 1968 after Richard Nixon 's election . They have been saying it ever since . That day may eventually arrive , but today is not that day . They may also believe they are a permanent party , but history is filled with Ozymandias like permanence .
Last Tuesday 's voter turnout should not give the Democrats the comfort they have taken from it . As should now be obvious , the Democrats have no coalition of their own . It is controlled by the very man who , the day after Curb-Stomp 2014 , went on national television to stomp their feet in retaliation , rhetorically show voters their middle finger , and behave generally like a petulant man-child . Democrats have a Barack Obama problem .
Republicans , now making kissy-face with Democrats and pledging ‚Äú to work together , ‚Äù should tread carefully . Most anyone who worked too closely with Barack Obama in the past few years has suffered the fate of the dodo bird ‚Äî hunted mercilessly to extinction . At least twenty-five Senate Democrats who voted for the President 's healthcare plan now have the title ‚Äú former ‚Äù preceding their title ‚Äú Senator . ‚Äù
From Massachusetts to Maryland to Illinois and more , pundits who two years ago cheerful described the Republican Party as a ‚Äú regional party ‚Äù mostly in the South , had to bitterly and through gritted teeth admit a crimson wave swept the country . It started , interestingly enough , in Guam . Fifteen or so hours before the polls began closing domestically , that American territory saw Republicans capture it . The tsunami only grew as it began making landfall in Maine . Most commentators expected Republican Governor LePage to lose . They did not .
In Florida , where virtually every poll showed Charlie Crist would take back the Governor 's Mansion , Governor Rick Scott held on forcing Crist and their oscillating fan to find a new wind direction . The savage destruction of the Democrats leave that party in the fetal position mumbling their safe words , ‚Äú demography ‚Äù and ‚Äú turnout. ‚Äù One word that is no longer safe is ‚Äú Obama . ‚Äù
The day after the election , President Obama 's press conference descended into farce . They declared they will do what they want , veto what they do not want , and will work with the Republicans only to the extent they do what they want . A man who has been given everything in life on a silver platter , can not be expected to act graciously when the platter is finally taken away . But President Obama 's defiant and petulant tone last Wednesday suggests they are a President in search of new voters who will appreciate it .
Americans should , therefore , not be surprised if by executive fiat the President ushers in a new class of American ‚Äî the illegal alien . Christian sinners may be washed in the blood of the lamb , but President Obama intends their Cult of Personality to be washed in the red wake of a Republican take over . An action they could not take before the election because of its deep unpopularity will be taken after the election because they need new disciples .
What can the Democrats ' do ? They have been renting Obama 's coalition . Should they distance themselves from President Obama , they will anger President Obama 's base . Should they embrace President Obama , they will anger everyone else . Hillary Clinton will have a hard time running a big government campaign when Americans no longer trust big government . But should they try to claim government was not the failure , just Obama , they will have to fight them for votes . Democrats comforting themselves on low turnout in 2014 ignore that they will have to have a civil war to capture President Obama 's base from them in 2016 .
President Obama will not go quietly . The Democrats will have to deal with this , their own problem of their own creation . Jesus Christ so loved the world , they suffered that those who believe in Him might live . In Barack Obama 's world , Obama so loves himself , we must all now suffer that they might live on politically relevant . God help us all .
The Universe According to Ernests Gulbis ; it 's a little weird . Gulbis has shown over the past month that they are the most dangerous young player on the men 's tour : in Rome they eliminated Roger Federer and took a set off Rafael Nadal in the semi-finals , and they were a set and a break up against Federer in Madrid in the last eight ... yet they are n't sure whether they even like tennis , and they are adamant that they do n't care for fame or money .
As for the night that they spent in a police cell in Stockholm , after they were arrested for soliciting prostitutes during a tournament , they regard that as a hilarious and wonderful adventure , as ‚Äú it was great , it was great fun , a very funny time ‚Äù .
They are the ‚Äò Trustafarian ' of the international tennis scene , the kid from the Baltic who previously appeared to have more wealth and talent than they knew what to do with , but who is now starting to apply himself .
On the Roland Garros clay and the Wimbledon grass this summer , Federer and Nadal could be troubled by Gulbis , who is too intelligent to be a ‚Äú tennis freak ‚Äù or a grey obsessive , whose father is an oligarch and one of the richest men in Latvia , and who has been rumoured to travel to tournaments in their dad 's private jet .
That did n't exactly amount to a denial by the 21 year-old , who recommended that everyone should try to spend at least one evening behind bars , just for the thrill of it , just for the experience .
At times , Gulbis sounds as though they have stepped straight out of that teen film , Ferris Bueller 's Day Off . Perhaps think Marat Safin , or think Goran Ivanisevic . Just with reddish-brown hair , from Riga .
Gulbis , who is at a career high of 27 in the rankings , and whose preparations for Roland Garros have included reading The Revolution of the Ants , a science-fiction novel by the French writer Bernard Werber , said it had been a misunderstanding in Sweden last autumn : they did not know that they were with a prostitute as they walked into a hotel , as when they meet girls they are not in the habit of asking them what they do for a living .
‚Äú It was great , it was great fun , but I 'm never going to go to Sweden again in my life . If you go out and meet some girls , and immediately you 're put in jail ; that 's not normal , ‚Äù said Gulbis , as they discussed their encounter with the vice police for the first time .
‚Äú When I meet a girl , I do n't ask them what their profession is , I do n't ask if she 's a hairdresser or something else . I just meet them And they meet me . They maybe does n't ask what I 'm doing . Anyway , if they do ask , I usually lie ; I say that I do nothing or I 'm a musician or something . Suddenly , the police come and take me to jail , so I spend the night in jail for nothing , really nothing . So I 'm upset with the Swedish government . ‚Äù
For Gulbis , a night in a cell was an education , and certainly not something to be ashamed of .
‚Äú It was very funny . I think every person should go to jail once , as it 's interesting . It 's really interesting , as they are very strict . I was in jail for one night , about six hours . I slept a bit . Then the prosecutor came and they asked me what happened , and then they said , ‚Äò Sorry , we did n't know that it was this ' .
`` And they let me go after I paid a fine . I paid the minimum fine for violating the law in Sweden . It 's the same fine I would get for , say , smashing up a telephone booth . I paid 250 or 300 euros to get out of jail , as I had a match to play in just a few days , and I could n't stay there anymore , ‚Äù recalled Gulbis , and they giggled at the memories .
Money does n't motivate or interest him . ‚Äú Because I come from a wealthy family , it 's more normal for me to have this money as a tennis player . It 's OK if it 's there , it 's OK if it 's not there . It 's not a big issue for me . If you come from a poor family , you want to pull yourself up , you have a goal to earn money . I do n't have that goal . ‚Äù
And they are n't playing for celebrity either .
‚Äú The fire in me is that I want to prove to myself that I can do it , that I can be at the top . I do n't care about money , I do n't care about fame . I do n't like money and fame , I do n't need them and I 'm not living for them . I do n't know if I like or love the game so much .
`` I enjoy competing . I do n't like practising . When I 'm on court and it 's a competition , I enjoy it . I enjoy having a goal . When you reach a goal , it 's OK , but also an empty feeling . When I won my first ATP tournament this year , I was happy for maybe 10 minutes , and that was it . Then I had an empty feeling , ‚Äù they said .
‚Äú And then we are on to the next week , that 's OK . It 's good in tennis that you always have to push yourself for new achievements . ‚Äù
Gulbis 's grandfather was a leading film director in Latvia , and their mother is an actor . Ernests , who was named after Ernest Hemingway ( in the Baltic , they add the ‚Äò s ' ) , appeared in a film when they were a child ; it was directed by their grandfather and their mother played the part of their screen mum .
It was in 2007 that Gulbis first introduced themselves in tennis , when they smacked Tim Henman off the court in the first round of the French Open , and later that season they reached the last 16 of the US Open .
The following year , they were a quarter-finalist at the French Open . But , and perhaps this was because they were not leaving enough sweat on the practice court or in the gym , they did not progress at all during 2009 : in fact , they had a horrible season , and dropped out of the top 100 .
‚Äú There is a lot you can get wrong in tennis , and that 's what I did , ‚Äù Gulbis disclosed .
We have seen a very different Gulbis in 2010 .
‚Äú I woke up one morning with a hangover , I clicked my fingers , and decided , ‚Äò right , now I go for it ' , ‚Äù they said .
But that was ( probably ) a joke . The reality is that , towards the end of last year , they consulted their friend Safin , who is now retired , about the Russian 's former coach , the Argentine Hernan Gumy . If Gulbis had not taken Safin 's advice and had not hired Gumy , perhaps they would not have had the ‚Äú empty feeling ‚Äù of scoring their first tour title in Delray Beach in Florida in February , and perhaps they would not have been such a nuisance to Federer and Nadal on the clay .
We can thank Safin for the fact that Gulbis is out there on the biggest stages , sending over their cheeky drop shots and sitting cross-legged during changeovers .
‚Äú I think anyone sitting on the sides can see that I 've got fitter ; I 'm staying in the rallies and not hitting so many crazy shots . I 'm more confident in every shot and in every area . Every aspect of my game is better . ‚Äù
The Wimbledon crowds would n't recognise Gulbis as the player who , in the second round against Andy Murray last season , had no faith in their game .
Gulbis and Safin , a Muscovite who was once the world No 1 and who is still a world-class libertine , have a similar attitude towards tennis .
‚Äú What we have in common is that he 's not a tennis freak and I 'm not a tennis freak , ‚Äù Gulbis said . ‚Äú We both perfectly understand that there 's more to life than tennis .
`` This is a good part of your life , but it will end . It will end when you 're 30 , and you should n't plan a life in tennis forever . Tennis is just one part of my life , and then when I quit tennis , I 'm going to start a new life .
‚Äú I visited Marat in Moscow , and in the summer he 's coming to see me in Latvia as we have a big music festival . We are trying to arrange a few things . ‚Äù
Latvia , beware . Just as Safin used to do , Gulbis wrecks a lot of rackets . They have estimated that they mangle about 60 to 70 frames a year .
‚Äú I felt bad after going to the Head factory in Austria where they make the rackets , and I saw all the work that they do . It 's hand-made , they do everything for the players , they really think about what the players need , and then an idiot like me comes and breaks it . Sorry , that 's my emotions , I ca n't hide them . ‚Äù
Can Gulbis reach the top of the game ? ‚Äú I 'm not going to tell you what I 'm going to do , because words are nothing , ‚Äù they said .
‚Äú When I beat the top players , then I will say what I feel and what I think . Now , they are just words , I can say whatever , and the words mean nothing . ‚Äù
Compared to men 's boxing , however , it lacked popularity and exposure . This might be attributed to the fact that women 's boxing confronted a society filled with stereotypes and which categorized professions as either ‚Äò men 's work ' or ‚Äò women 's work ' , or because most people did not believe they would find the same caliber as in men 's boxing .
Women 's boxing can trace it beginnings to London in the 1720 's . During the following one and a half centuries women sporadically came out to the ring for exhibition and competitive fights as well as for prize bouts . In the second half of the 19th century women 's boxing got publicity in the States and outside of it ‚Äì thanks to Richard Fox and their ‚Äú Police Gazette ‚Äù .
Women 's boxing first appeared in the Olympic Games at a demonstration bout in 1902 . For most of the 20th century , however , it was banned in most nations . Its revival was pioneered by the Swedish Amateur Boxing Association , which sanctioned events for women in 1988 . The British Amateur Boxing Association sanctioned its first boxing competition for women in 1997 . The first event was to be between two thirteen-year-olds , but one of the boxers withdrew because of hostile media attention .
The A.I.B.A . accepted new rules for Women 's Boxing at the end of the 20th century and approved the first European Cup for Women in 1999 and the first World Championship for women in 2001 . Women 's boxing was not featured at the 2008 Olympics ; however , on 14 August 2009 , it was announced that the International Olympic Committee 's Executive Board ( EB ) had approved the inclusion of women 's boxing for the Games in London in the 2012 Olympics , contrary to the expectations of some observers .
The boom of women 's boxing came during the 1990s , coinciding with the boom of professional women sports leagues such as the WNBA and WUSA , and with boxers such as Stephanie Jaramillo Delia ‚Äò Chikita ' Gonzalez , Laura Serrano , Christy Martin , Deirdre Gogarty , Laila Ali , Jackie Frazier-Lyde , Lucia Rijker , Ada V√©lez , Ivonne Caples , Bonnie Canino and Sumya Anani , all world champions , jumping into the scene .
Women 's boxing is growing with more television exposure , including the movie Million Dollar Baby . There are a few organizations that recognize world championship bouts , and fights are held in more than 100 countries worldwide .

NEW YORK ( Reuters Health ) - Using alcohol leads to unsafe driving and compromised relationships with peers , while using marijuana harms relationships with authority figures , U.S. teens said in a survey .
‚Äú Our most serious finding was that people who reported drinking alcohol were much more likely to report driving unsafely as a direct effect of use , ‚Äù said lead author Joseph J. Palamar of New York University Langone Medical Center 's Department of Population Health .
‚Äú That does n't mean that using marijuana and driving is safe , but people perceive alcohol to have a more negative effect on driving , ‚Äù Palamar told Reuters Health by phone .
They and their team analyzed responses in nationally representative surveys of high school seniors between 2007 and 2011 .
Most participants were 18 years old , and they answered questions about their history of alcohol and marijuana use and whether either substance had caused any of 15 problems , including hurting relationships with parents , significant others , friends or teachers , emotional instability , reduced energy and unsafe driving .
Nearly 97 percent of the students reported having ever consumed alcohol and 60 percent said they had used marijuana .
Compared to marijuana users , alcohol users reported more regrettable behavior , more unsafe driving and less emotional stability , according to the results in The American Journal of Drug and Alcohol Abuse .
Almost a quarter of kids who used only alcohol said it caused them to behave in ways they later regretted , compared to six percent of those who only used marijuana .
More marijuana users reported becoming involved with others who were a ‚Äú bad influence ‚Äù and tied the drug to having less energy , worse school performance and damaged relationships with supervisors or teachers .
Alcohol users reported more harm to relationships with peers , as opposed to superiors .
That may have to do with the illegality of the substances , Palamar said . While using either one is illegal for a high school senior , alcohol is an ubiquitous part of pop culture and society at large , whereas kids who smoke pot are more readily pinpointed as `` outsiders , '' they said .
‚Äú Alcohol is pushed on us by society , ‚Äù they said . ‚Äú You ca n't watch a sporting event without having alcohol . ‚Äù
Most people think of marijuana as less dangerous , but Palamar stressed that the kids in this study were not asked to compare the dangers of alcohol and marijuana .
‚Äú I compared them , but the students did n't , ‚Äù they said .
Research that does compare the two head to head tends to get it wrong , according to drug policy expert Jonathan P. Caulkins of Carnegie Mellon University Heinz College in Pittsburgh .
‚Äú The breakthrough here and what I 'm glad to see is they did n't fall into that trap , ‚Äù Caulkins told Reuters Health .
‚Äú The gestalt and conventional wisdom has been to say that marijuana is safer , and that 's primarily because marijuana has lower risk of leading to death , ‚Äù they said .
Both substances are unhealthy , particularly for teens , and the two separate substances should n't be compared they said .
‚Äú Parents ca n't control their behavior , but to the extent they can , they should try to keep ( kids ) away from both , ‚Äù Caulkins said .
The surveys were done before recreational marijuana had been legalized in Colorado and Washington , and the results may be different in those states today , Palamar noted .

maintains the largest guild profiles database : Let 's take a look at the recruitment stats for the last 30 days.The picture shows how many guilds want to recruit each class . Note that it contains only profiles updated in the last 30 days.Obviously there are hybrid classes that get higher demand . But we still can compare similar classes.There are more guilds want to recruit Deathknights ( 2783 vs 2623 ) .Shamans are slightly more attractive than Priests ( 3087 vs 2964 ) .There is quite big difference : 3238 vs 2947.Even shamans and priests are more preferable than paladins.The reason could be that paladins do n't have ranged damage option ? Warlock is the most demanded ranged dps class at the moment ( 2862 guilds want to recruit them ) , followed by mage ( 2679 ) .There is much fewer requests for hunters ( 2495 ) .Rogue is the only pure melee dps class and that seems to be one of the reasons is the least demanded class.Note that 1392 guilds have specified that they recruit all classes.There is one class left :
Updated 1 p.m. | Do n't expect any more appropriations bills to make it through the House chamber any time soon . Not until Republicans and Democrats work out issues on the Confederate flag .
That was the message to members on Tuesday from Speaker John A. Boehner , according to Rep. John Fleming .
Boehner reportedly told Republicans during their weekly closed-door meeting there was a hold on all spending bills until they could figure something out on the Confederate flag .
Republicans are looking to avoid another floor situation like the one that occurred on July 9 , when Democrats forced votes on the Confederate flag . The Democrats ' action came after an exclusive CQ Roll Call report the night before on Republican efforts to roll back restrictions on the display and sale of the Confederate symbols in federal cemeteries .
`` We know that every approps bill that we put forward they 're going to go back to trying to make some , you know ‚Äî exploit for political reasons what happened in South Carolina , '' Fleming told reporters Tuesday . `` And so the speaker wants to work something out with Democrats so they 'll stop doing that so we can move forward . ''
Asked if Boehner knew that Democrats were going to bring up a Confederate flag amendment on every appropriations bill , Fleming said , `` No , but they just knows Nancy Pelosi . ''
Boehner 's office and the office of Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy did not respond to requests for confirmation .
Republicans delayed consideration of the Financial Services appropriations bill for this week , and they pulled the Interior-Environment spending bill in an attempt to avoid a politically divisive vote on a Confederate flag amendment . But a complete hold on appropriations bills at this point in July ‚Äî only two weeks away from the August recess ‚Äî could mean that the appropriations season is officially over .
If Republicans and Democrats are unable to find an agreement on the Confederate flag , and if Boehner does not intend to put a spending bill on the floor until that issue is resolved , it will soon be September .
The House is scheduled to return from its summer break on Sept. 8 , and there are only 10 legislative days in that month before government funding runs out .
With six appropriations bills through the House chamber , and exactly zero through the Senate , leaders could finally be looking at the prospect of a large spending deal to keep the government open .

Researchers Link Marijuana And Earlier Onset Of Psychosis
Enlarge this image toggle caption David McNew/Getty Images David McNew/Getty Images
Can marijuana use lead to mental health problems popping up sooner ?
The question weighs on the minds of parents and doctors . Now there 's more evidence , culled from more than 80 different studies , that marijuana can speed up development of serious psychotic illness .
Australian researchers found that marijuana users who developed psychosis were 2.7 years younger than nonusers who became psychotic . Other sorts of substance abuse sped up psychosis by 2 years , but alcohol alone showed no effect . The result were published online by the Archives of General Psychiatry .
What 's going on ?
The researcher say the results point toward a strong effect for marijuana in vulnerable people :
This study lends weight to the view that cannabis use precipitates schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders ....
Alternative explanations could be that people prone to psychosis are medicating themselves with marijuana or that the drug worsens subtler symptoms .
`` It is a wonderful meta-analysis , '' Dr. William Eaton , chairperson of the mental health department at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health , told Shots after reviewing the paper . The work is both `` timely and well done , '' they say , and adds to the evidence that `` there is an association between using cannabis and psychosis . ''
Proving causation is a high bar , and Eaton says this paper ca n't be said to go that far . `` I think it could be true , but there 's no real compelling evidence of that . ''
Still , they say , the researcher 's consolidation of the literature is valuable and important . And the finding that marijuana is associated with earlier onset of severe mental illness is troubling , Eaton says . Even a few years can make a big difference in how a young person 's life unfolds . Someone who becomes mentally ill at 22 has a better prognosis than someone struck at 18 .
What should parents do ? If there 's a history of schizophrenia in a family , Eaton says , or the `` kids were a little strange , '' say loners or prone to flight of fancy , `` I 'd be real worried about them using marijuana . '' They say we should `` protect people '' from marijuana who might be on the road to developing psychosis .

JOHNS HOPKINS ( US ) ‚Äî Flagging rates of male circumcision could cost the US $ 4.4 billion more in health care expenses , researchers warn .
The researchers base their predictions on rates of male circumcision in the US continuing to drop over the next decade to levels like those already seen in Europe .
[ sources ]
The added expense would stem from expected new cases and higher rates of sexually transmitted infections and related cancers among uncircumcised men and their female partners , according to the report in the Archives of Pediatrics & Adolescent Medicine .
A team of Johns Hopkins University disease experts and health economists says its cost analysis appears to be the first to account for increased rates of multiple infectious diseases associated with lower rates of male circumcision , including HIV/AIDS , herpes , and genital warts , and cervical and penile cancers .
Previous research focused mostly on HIV , the single most costly disease where risk of infection is decreased by male circumcision .
Roughly 55 percent of the 2 million boys born each year in the United States are circumcised , a decline from a high of 79 percent in the 1970s and 1980s , says epidemiologist and pathologist Aaron Tobian , leader of the study . Rates in Europe average 10 percent , and , in Denmark , only 1.6 percent of infant males undergo the procedure .
‚Äú Our economic evidence is backing up what our medical evidence has already shown to be perfectly clear , ‚Äù says Tobian , an assistant professor in the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine .
‚Äú There are health benefits to infant male circumcision in guarding against illness and disease , and declining male circumcision rates come at a severe price , not just in human suffering , but in billions of health care dollars as well . ‚Äù
Circumcision removes foreskin at the tip of the penis , hindering the buildup of bacteria and viruses in the penis ' skin folds . The 20-year decline in the number of circumcised US baby boys has already cost the nation upwards of $ 2 billion , Tobian and their colleagues estimate .
Their analysis shows that , on average , each male circumcision not performed leads eventually to $ 313 more in illness-related expenses .
According to the analysis , if circumcision among men born in the same year dropped to European rates , there would be an expected 12 percent increase in men infected with HIV , 29 percent more men infected with human papillomavirus , a 19 percent increase in men infected with herpes simplex virus , and a 211 percent jump in the number of infant male urinary tract infections .
Among their female sex partners , there would be 50 percent more cases each of bacterial vaginosis and trichomoniasis . The number of new infections with the high-risk form of human papillomavirus , which is closely linked to cervical cancer in women , would increase by 18 percent .
State 's choices
State funding cuts in Medicaid , the government medical assistance program for the poor , have contributed substantially to the decline in US infant male circumcisions , Tobian says , noting that 18 states have stopped paying for the procedure .
‚Äú The financial and health consequences of these decisions are becoming worse over time , especially if more states continue on this ill-fated path , ‚Äù they say . ‚Äú State governments need to start recognizing the medical benefits as well as the cost savings from providing insurance coverage for infant male circumcision . ‚Äù
The researchers built a new economic model to predict the cost implications of not circumcising a male newborn . Included was information from studies and databases that closely tracked the total number of people infected with each sexually transmitted disease and the numbers of new infections .
Costs were conservatively limited to direct costs for drug treatment , physician visits , and hospital care , and did not include indirect costs from work absences and medical travel expenses .
The most recent states to stop Medicaid funding for infant circumcision were Colorado and South Carolina in 2011 .
Other states that do not fund circumcision through Medicaid are Arizona , California , Florida , Idaho Louisiana , Maine , Minnesota , Mississippi , Missouri , Montana , Nevada , North Carolina , North Dakota , Oregon , Utah , and Washington .

Today , I am going to share 4 most Interesting Facts about Domain names that you probably have n't heard .
1 . Believe it or not , Until 1995 Domain Registration was free !
Prices of Domain Names went through a lot of ups and downs since the very beginning , Domain names started as a free asset in 1985 but In the year 1995 when Network Solutions was granted the authority to start charging for domain names , They kept the price at 100 USD for 2 years , which dropped to 70 USD in the year 1997 .
In 1998 , Domain name prices came down after the formation of ICANN ( The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers ) .
2 . Domain name such as example.com or example.org is reserved for use in private testing only and can not be registered by anyone .
Earlier , Under the act RFC 2606 , Following were the domain names which were technically unregistrable ,
test.com
example.com
invalid.com
localhost.com
But , Somehow After sometime , all other domains except example.com ( /.net/.org/etc ) became available for registration .
3 . PrivateJet.com is the most expensive domain name sold ever at $ 30.2 million .
Earlier this year Nations Luxury Transportation , LLC acquired the domain PrivateJet.com for $ 30.2 million , making it the most expensive domain ever sold .
In the race of most expensive domain sales , Privatejet.com is followed by , Insure.com ( $ 16 Million ) and on the third spot comes sex.com ( $ 13 Million ) .
4 . It costs $ 40,000 to register a Nigerian domain extension ( .ng ) for one year , while regular .com 's go for $ 10 a year on average .
Nigerian top-level domains are the most expensive in the world costing $ 40,000 per year and Namibia ( .na ) domains are the 2nd most expensive top level domains costing $ 4,300 USD , which is 10 times less than what Nigerian 's charge .
Now , the question is why Nigerian domain extension is so expensive ? Well , I tried to find the answer but could n't find anything reasonable . If you find out , share in comments .
That 's it for now , i hope you enjoyed the post .
Last time in Today I Learned section , I posted , 4 Interesting facts about Twitter usage , if you missed it or if you are new to our blog , Do check it out too , i bet you will be amazed . Here 's the Link .
No surprisingly , Butcher Billy ( see art above ) immediately saw the connection between James T. `` Joker '' Davis ' ( Matt Modine ) situation in the classic Stanley Kubrick movie Full Metal Jacket and the character Stripe ( Malachi Kirby ) in the Black Mirror Episode `` Men Against Fire . ''
In both cases , the soldier in question lives in the gray zone between their desire to be a good citizen ( patriot ) soldier while at the same time trying to resolve the cognitive dissonance between patriotism and committing the murders often required by patriotism .
The title of this episode `` Men Against Fire '' is a reference to S.L.A . Marshall 's book of the same name which claims that the vast majority of soldiers have a hard time bringing themselves to fire on enemies because , at a very basic human level , no matter how just the cause , they do n't want to be responsible for the killing of other human beings .
One of the tricks the propaganda organs of government have used over time to confront this problem has been to reduce `` enemies '' to sub-human in information released through all official and contracted agencies ( check out the political cartoons of the Japanese from WW2 and you will get the basic idea ) . This process of officially sanctioned dehumanization , at its worst , can be seen in what happened in Nazi Germany and during the Rwandan genocide .
The `` future '' military in this episode of Black Mirror has secretly solved the `` Men Against Fire '' problem by equipping every soldier with a neural implant called a `` MASS . '' I have said this throughout , Black Mirror uses technology as a device to create distance between the watcher and what is happening on the screen . What is reflected in the Black Mirror is us now ( not some future citizens in some dystopian future ) .
The soldiers are told that the MASS only enhances their reflexes and senses but we find out , during the episode , that the MASS device also induce sex dreams ( so that soldiers have good memories of their sleep ) and also masks targets as genetically inferior humans ( it is not clear how they identify between the genetically inferior and the normal humans ) called `` Roaches '' so that they appear sub-human to the MASS-implanted soldiers ( they appear to have blurred and insect-like features ) .
But you can find examples of this kind of dehumanization all around us in people without MASS devices . Last week , for instance , ICE agents removed a woman scheduled to have brain surgery to remove a tumor to a detention facility because they also happen to be an illegal immigrant .
All it takes in the United States now to justify the removal of a critically ill mother of two is for one passionate but cynical blowhard yelling for months about `` bad dudes '' and insisting that they only wants to remove the people who have come to the United States to `` rape '' and `` murder '' Americans . Of course , President Trump is n't carrying out mass deportations , this is a simple and just military action to protect Americans .
And that is the other side of what Brooker is getting at here , continual fear has to be produced and manufactured to maintain a fascist security state . Manufacturing fear is part of the security state which becomes dependent , almost addicted , to funding and power .

CEBU may experience a break from the hot weather as light to moderate rains are expected in the province until Wednesday this week due to the amihan or northeast monsoon winds .
Alfredo Quiblat Jr. , chief of the Philippine Atmospheric Geophysical and Astronomical Services ( Pagasa ) Mactan office said the rains ‚Äú will be intermittent . ‚Äù
‚Äú It 's better to stay indoors , ‚Äù they said in a phone interview .
Quiblat reminded the public especially those attending the 51st International Eucharistic Congress ( IEC ) or those leaving their homes to bring umbrellas and raincoats .
They said the temperature in Cebu will be 24 to 30 degrees Celsius .
Quiblat also reminded the public that a gale warning was issued yesterday along the portions of Eastern Visayas seas .
Quiblat said wind speed will range from 50 to 60 kilometers per hour while waves will be 3.4 to 4.5 meters high .
Commodore Enrico Evangelista , commander of the Philippine Coast Guard ( PCG ) Central Visayas station , said sea travel going to Eastern Visayas were canceled yesterday .
In Cebu City , two passenger vessels with 30 passengers bound to Ormoc were barred from traveling along with four vessels at Port of Tangil ( Dumanjug ) bound for Guihulngan , Negros Oriental that had 50 passengers .
In Port of Bato ( Samboan ) , two vessels , two fastcraft , and one motorbanca were not allowed to sail going to Sibulan , Negros Oriental .
In Hagnaya Port in San Remegio town eight rolling cargoes and two passenger vessels with 78 passengers bound to Sta . Fe , Bantayan were barred from travel .
Commander Agapito Bibat , Philippine Coast Guard-Cebu station chief , said vessels below 250 gross tons were not allowed to sail due to gale warning .
They said about 269 people were stranded due to the suspension of trips for small vessels with 250 gross tonnage .
Former GOP member of congress Jack Kingston triggered CNN 's Jake Tapper Monday by pointing out Trump supporters are the only ones actually being violently attacked in the wake of the election .
After David Gergen told Tapper that Donald Trump `` needs to address '' the fears of Soros-funded professional protesters whining about supposedly getting mean words hurled at them , Former Georgia Congressman Jack Kingston responded by citing an endless series of attacks on Trump supporters -- from the firebombing of the GOP headquarters in North Carolina to the recent beating of a `` white Trump voter '' by `` African-American men '' in Chicago .
Tapper got triggered by Kingston pointing out the race of the assailants :
Partial transcript via Mediaite :
Kingston : We know in Chicago , for example , that a white Trump voter was beat up by African American men .
Tapper : Why does it matter the race of the people that beat them up ?
Kingston : Because that 's what the topic is here . Just to quote : ‚Äú xenophobia , homophobia , racist , and sexist. ‚Äù That 's what we talked about in the last hour .
Tapper : All you had to do was say ‚Äú a Trump voter was beaten up. ‚Äù I do n't know why you 'd mention the race .
Kingston : Because I did n't bring it up . You guys brought it up .
Tapper : This incident in Chicago ?
Kingston : Yes . Hey Jake , if race does n't matter why does CNN cite race every time a white person shoots a black person ?
Why does CNN never do the same in reverse , even though whites are multiple times more likely to be shot by blacks than vice versa ?
How about CNN issue an apology for helping foment the Black Lives Matter terrorist movement which resulted in the murder of over a dozen white people , including over five cops in Dallas ?
Kudos to Former Congressman Jack Kingston for having the balls to speak the truth rather than falling all over themselves to apologize for doing nothing wrong .
We 're witnessing an uncuckening like the world has never seen .

The widely-reported opinion that California can not afford to provide comprehensive healthcare to all of its residents has been debunked by a recently released study of the projected costs of the Healthy California Act , SB 562 , by the Political Economic Research Institute at UMass Amherst .
The misleading figure of $ 404 billion that is often quoted is the cost under the existing fragmented , dysfunctional , for-profit insurance system . But a single payer plan like SB 562 has many cost-savings built in ; among them hugely reducing the administrative costs involved in private insurance and bringing the weight of California to the table when negotiating with drug companies . Access to early and preventative care will cut down expensive emergency room visits . The real estimated cost of SB 562 is $ 331 billion , a savings of 18 percent over the $ 368.5 billion we are paying now to leave 2.7 million of our neighbors uninsured and another 12 million underinsured .
So where will that $ 331 billion come from ? First , $ 225 billion of our total healthcare costs is already taxpayer financed through Medicare , Medi-Cal and subsidies to private insurers . With waivers we would shift these funds into the Healthy California system and according to the study , we could finance the remaining $ 106 billion with two new taxes . Yes , that dirty word ‚Äú taxes. ‚Äù But under this plan all businesses that currently provide health insurance would actually save money and so would very nearly all households . Businesses would pay 2.3 percent on gross revenues , with the first $ 2 million exempted , which would mean that the smallest businesses would pay nothing . The projected net savings for small businesses that currently provide health benefits is 22 percent , 7-13 percent savings for medium-sized businesses , and 0.6 percent for larger employers . This tax is projected to raise $ 92 billion .
The remaining $ 14.3 billion would be funded by a sales tax of 2.3 percent that would exempt spending on housing , utilities , food at home and other necessities . Since all premiums , deductibles , co-pays and out-of-pocket expenses for services that will be newly covered under SB 562 will be eliminated , low-income families can expect to save 1.2-5.5 percent and middle-income families 2.6-9.1 percent over what they are paying now . Only higher-income families will see a small increase of 1.5-1.7 percent .
While Healthy California 's comprehensive benefits are too many to list , they include all the benefits covered by Medicare , Medi-Cal and the Children 's Health Insurance Program . In addition to in- and out-patient medical , hospitalization , emergency care , health and wellness education , and much more , it will also cover services that are often not covered : dental , vision , prescription drugs , mental health and addiction services , acupuncture , chiropractic and other proven safe and effective complementary and integrative health services , adult day care , and hospice services , to name just a few .
Instead of being limited by narrow insurance company networks , Californians will have free choice of any provider . Healthcare decision-making will be returned to the province of highly-trained medical professionals , in partnership with their patients , where it belongs .
The current healthcare system has excluded millions of people and it has too often led to situations that have resulted in increased illness and death . More than half of all bankruptcies in the U.S. arise from a medical issue , and of those bankruptcies three-quarters had healthcare insurance when the medical problem started . The U.S. has the most expensive health care among industrialized countries , all of which have some form of universal healthcare , but ranks near the bottom for health outcomes . We can do better . We need to enact SB 562 . We ca n't afford not to .

Poor decisions have put referees in the firing line again , yet their dedication and commitment remains undimmed and as the next generation comes through , their preparation for the big stage is better than ever
Why do it ? Talking to the men earmarked to be the elite referees of the future , an unavoidable question elicits a knowing smile . This season , criticism of a pressurised vocation has flared up to the point where some former officials have felt compelled to turn on their own and lament the standard . That is quite striking , because the more you talk to referees the more obvious it is that supporting each other through thick and thin is fundamental .
So why do it ? Why spend countless hours driving up and down the country to dole out rules , some of which are inevitably going to upset people , trying to climb up the officiating ladder until you reach the chance to make decisions on television in front of millions who scrutinise you and lacerate your ability courtesy of umpteen different angles and slow-motion replays ?
A glimpse of an answer suddenly appears written all over the face of Lee Swabey moments after they blow the final whistle of a 2-1 win for Grimsby over Woking in the Conference . They get what all referees hope for every time they step into the middle of the fray . ‚Äú Twenty-two handshakes , ‚Äù they explain afterwards , proudly . Symbolically , a full set of handshakes , plus a well done from both managers , represents maximum satisfaction . Once they have showered , changed , and they and their assistants have had a quick debrief with the assessor , Swabey is still beaming . ‚Äú The buzz , ‚Äù as they call it , of a game that passes smoothly , is something they love . ‚Äú I would n't spend so much time away from my family if this did n't mean the world to me . ‚Äù
As one of the group that is highly regarded by the powers that be of PGMOL ( Professional Game Match Officials Limited ) for their potential , Swabey knew they were being watched at Woking 's Kingfield stadium . PGMOL 's chief , Mike Riley , was in attendance , alongside Steve Dunn , who is the coach for this level , plus the assessor John Norbury , armed with notes and stopwatch to catalogue every significant move the officials make .
Three wise men ? The organisation has been in the spotlight during a season pockmarked by controversial errors . But none of that seems to diminish their belief in what they are trying to do . There are certainly a lot of high-profile matches and game-changing calls under their collective belts , and they see it as a duty to pass that experience on to the next generation . To help .
A few weeks earlier , Riley , Dunn and another former referee , Peter Jones , made their way to Alfreton Town to cast their eye over another tipped to progress ‚Äì John Brooks is something of a prodigy in the mould of one of the current favourites , Michael Oliver . They have been running the line at Premier League level since the age of 21 , has taken to refereeing in the Conference in their first season at this standard , has every chance of being promoted to the Football League list in the next couple of years , and then who knows ? ‚Äú I hope to have the opportunity to get promoted to the Premier League and officiate some of the top games in this country , ‚Äù Brooks says .
The most the PGMOL delegation got to observe , however , was the way Brooks handled the somewhat tricky situation of calling off Alfreton v Lincoln because of a frozen pitch . It is all part of the rich tapestry of experience Brooks needs to acquire before they are trusted with more high-profile games , the myriad different problems outside a normal 90 minutes which need dealing with ‚Äì often clubs are very reluctant to have a late postponement , particularly when they have to pay all the flight attendants and staff who have turned up but will not receive any gate money .
Brooks phoned their coach , a former referee supplied by PGMOL to be a mentor of sorts , for advice . With confidence reaffirmed , they made the difficult but right call . A little later the Alfreton secretary arrived with envelopes to pay the officials for their time ‚Äì the match fee in the Conference is ¬£95 so it is safe to suggest these men do not do it for the cash .
Brooks , like Swabey , has clear ambition to progress . They are under no illusions that developing a thick skin and perfecting strategies to deal with disappointments is a big part of that . How do they feel watching Match of the Day when a referee gets vilified ? ‚Äú Erm ‚Ä¶ not great , ‚Äù they admit . ‚Äú I 've been in that situation once where I have made an incorrect decision and it was a deciding goal that was just offside . That is tough . Your heart sinks . You ca n't stop thinking about it .
‚Äú I do sometimes wish people understood the time and effort we put in .
‚Äú It is very easy to slate a decision but we do everything to try to get these decisions right . In certain situations you are going to be unpopular but if you are uncomfortable with that you are probably in the wrong job . ‚Äù
So Riley , Dunn and Jones retreat to the Alfreton boardroom for a hot dinner and the chance to explain how they go about garnering the improvements that will help the best reach the top and officiate in the Premier League . They are an interesting mix . Yorkshireman Riley is quietly methodical . Dunn , a hearty Bristolian , bursts with enthusiasm . Jones , from Leicester , is straight talking and sage .
What they all agree upon is that the backup , education and tools that today 's referees have is a world away from what they experienced in their own days with the whistle . Riley , as a young ref , went out and bought themselves a load of books on psychology and nutrition as there was no information on offer to them at all . Jones recalls that if they had a bad game they just had to rely on a ‚Äú Do n't worry , you 're OK ‚Äù from a fellow ref to pick them up .
Contrast this with Brooks , for example , who has a coach at the end of the phone . They consult weekly , discuss how their games have gone , study footage of key decisions and work out how to improve . They also have the support of sports psychologist Liam Slack on hand for regular guidance . They have an exercise regime to help them handle the 11km they run during a game , does a variety of fitness , stamina and warm-down work around games , and knows enough about nutrition that after calling off the match at Alfreton they want to head to the gym to burn the 2,000 calories they had eaten to fuel them for the expected 90 minutes .
‚Äú With elite performance they have all the backup ‚Äì strengthening , conditioning and all the psychology involved , ‚Äù says Riley . ‚Äú We want to tailor that education with our next generation . ‚Äù
PGMOL put ¬£1m into coaching and training referees last season , to attempt to mimic as best they can the kind of professionalism that has become the norm for players . There are get-togethers several times a season at the FA 's national football centre , St George 's Park .
Psychology is a particular focus . Brooks says it is vital in their development . ‚Äú One of the things we have talked about recently is parking decisions and moving on , ‚Äù they explain . ‚Äú There may be a big decision to make in the first 30 seconds of the game . Once you have made that you need to stay focused for the next 89 minutes and not be wondering whether that was correct or worrying about that decision . Liam has taught us some techniques for releasing that decision . We have been shown clips where you make a major decision and then shortly after that you make another couple of incorrect decisions because that is still on your mind . Working with the sports psychologist is really important for mental toughness . ‚Äù
Dunn picks up the theme : ‚Äú If something has gone terribly wrong you can ring someone ‚Äì there is a code of conduct and everything is confidential , the senior management wo n't even know about the conversation ‚Äì but they can talk in confidence , we can help them and go through the game with them . They can offload a lot of their concerns . Our job is to build them up so they can be ready for the next game . ‚Äù
Jones believes the whole approach can only help . ‚Äú I refereed in professional football but looking back I was an amateur , ‚Äù they say . ‚Äú I was going to work ‚Äì I worked for British Telecom ‚Äì and I might referee at Newcastle on a Wednesday with the pressure that came with that , and 9am the next morning I was in Leicester trying to speak to customers . I perhaps had n't slept . Or I had driven back , no chance of stopping . Training was ad hoc . We were amateurs in a professional environment compared to now . ‚Äù
When the subject of technology comes up , the three former refs are unanimous in their support of it . If it can be harnessed the right way to aid officials , it is welcome . ‚Äú We are all in favour of anything that makes the referee 's job better and makes them more effective on the field of play , ‚Äù says Riley .
Minimising mistakes is the aim . After all , a bad decision can stick with you for a while . ‚Äú The rest of your life , ‚Äù notes Jones with a chuckle .
BIG CALLS GO BAD
Former referees ' head Keith Hackett called this season 's elite refereeing standards ‚Äú disastrous ‚Äù and ‚Äú the worst we have seen ‚Äù . Among the recent high-profile mistakes :
‚ñ† 21 Feb Martin Atkinson is accused of missing a ‚Äú potentially career-ending ‚Äù challenge by Burnley 's Ashley Barnes ‚Äì sending off Chelsea 's Nemanja Matic for retaliating instead .
‚ñ† 28 Feb Roger East sends off Sunderland 's Wes Brown instead of John O'Shea for fouling Radamel Falcao ‚Äì but denies it was mistaken identity . Brown 's red card was overturned .
‚ñ† 21 Mar West Brom manager Tony Pulis calls for an extra video official after Neil Swarbrick sent off Gareth McAuley , mistaking them for Craig Dawson .
Nintendaily sits down with Pixel Perfex 's Director Anucha Aribarg to chat about their promising new indie title Earth Atlantis .
We reported with interest last week that the eye-catching indie title Earth Atlantis would soon be coming to Nintendo Switch . So when the opportunity for an interview with Earth Atlantis 's lead designer came along , we made sure to grab it with both hands .
In case you missed our report , Earth Atlantis is a unique underwater side-scroller which borrows DNA not just from genre classics Gladius , but also such boss-dominated games as Monster Hunter and Shadow of Colossus . Although the developers do n't exactly call it ‚Äò open world ' , it 's non-linear structure and conscious decision not to make be a bullet hell shooter sets it apart from the side-scrollers of the past . Ikaruga this is not .
It 's not just the gameplay that piqued my interest . Earth Atlantis 's art design is fantastic , using a sea-weathered ‚Äò old sketch pad ' aesthetic that brings to mind hand drawn charts and maps .
I was fortunate to speak with Earth Atlantis 's director Anucha Aribarg to dive deep into the game 's story , gameplay and inspiration . Although Aribarg was n't able to give me any details regarding the game 's Switch launch , they happily went into detail about the story of the game 's development , as well as talking about their own personal love of Nintendo .
Also of note is Aribarg narrowing down a release date to the 3rd quarter 2017 , meaning we should see it released between July and August on other consoles at least .
Earth Atlantis Interview
N : To start with , it would be great to know who you are , and what was your role in the development of Earth Atlantis ?
A : We are an indie developer called Pixel Perfex . My name is Anucha Aribarg , and I am the director and designer of Earth Atlantis .
N : So what exactly is Earth Atlantis ?
A : Earth Atlantis is a horizontal side-scrolling shooter with an original ‚Äò monster hunting ' gameplay mechanic . The mission is to hunt and destroy more than 25 dreadful sea monsters and explore the post-apocalyptic underwater world .
The game is presented in a very unique ‚Äò old sketch book ' visual style . We want to create the look of an ‚Äò old explorer sketch ' to express the essence of the 14th century 's ocean exploration when the sea was considered a dangerous place and full of monsters . We want the player to feel just like they are in a story from one of Jules Verne 's ocean adventure novels .
N : Please tell me about the story . Did you intend to have any climate change related message behind the flooding of the earth ?
A : ‚Äò The Great Climate Shift ' struck at the end of the 21st century , leaving 96 % of the earth 's surface underwater . Human civilization has fallen , and the ocean is full of creature-machine hybrid monsters . You are a hunter with a mission to destroy all monsters .
Actually , I had no intention whatsoever to send any message about climate change or global warming . But how else can you create a submarine shooting game with a post-apocalyptic world setting and tons of hybrid machine-creature monsters ? ! This story line is a no brainer . The core idea started with a picture of a space-submarine ship with some futuristic mechanical sea monsters .
Jules Verne 's Novels and illustrations also gave me inspiration ‚Äì fans of their work may discover the submarine ‚Äú Nautilus ‚Äù is not coincidental .
N : How did the game come about ? What was your inspiration ?
A : Well first of all , I love side-scrolling space shooters . I enjoyed classic shooters like Gradius and R-Type so much . Unfortunately , this genre is dying , or is perhaps already dead . Secondly , I always feel that ‚Äú boss battles ‚Äù are the most enjoyable part of all space shooting games ( vertical shooters included . ) That 's why Earth Atlantis is all about boss battles .
Lastly , just like most gamers nowadays , I do enjoy non-linear games , and I love the freedom of open world style games . I can not say Earth Atlantis is an ‚Äò open world ' game because the world size is not that big , but I did try to give the game the same feeling .
N : Could you tell me about Earth Atlantis 's development history ?
A : 10+ years ago I sketched a picture of a space-submarine ship with some futuristic mechanical sea monsters , and I kept thinking about that idea for quite some time . It was because of that I came up with the game 's sketch-drawing visuals .
I spent many years trying to make it into a real game . The biggest roadblock was how to make the game look exactly like an old drawing image . At first , I thought I could hand-draw everything , but after I did a couple of animation tests I found that it was impossible to make a game that way . Then the project was abandoned . Many years later , I tried to revive the project with pre-rendered 3D graphics . The look was perfect but the graphic data was too big . The project put was on-hold again .
Two years ago , when I started playing with Unity , I found that I might be able to make it happen with low-poly 3D models and a drawing-style shader . Now , we are entering the final phase of the production . It was a very long journey !
Actually , I had no intention whatsoever to send any massage about climate change or global warming . But how else can you create a submarine shooting game with a post-apocalyptic world setting and tons of hybrid machine-creature monsters ? !
N : The game 's steam page notes you can upgrade your ship and weapons . Perhaps you can give some detail on the mechanic of this , and what kind of upgrades are available ?
A : ‚Äú Upgrade ‚Äù is probably not the right word to use . You can ‚Äò Power-up ' your ship 's primary weapon and equip secondary weapons found in the game .
N : Tell me about the bosses ‚Äì how many are there ? What was the inspiration for their design ? Are they easy to find ?
A : Boss monsters are inspired by old sea-monster drawings and some prehistoric creatures . However , they are all mechanical . We had fun mixing these two concepts together .
We 've spent so much time on the boss battles , but we do n't want to make a bullet hell game where bosses shoot hundreds of patterned bullets all over the screen . We make sure that each boss fights differently , and the game is n't just about bullet patterns . Some bosses even have secret weak-points , and players may sometimes need to choose the right secondary weapon in order to beat a certain boss easily .
The game has about 20+ bosses with some special events . However , you 'll have to play multiple times to find all of them .
N : How big is the game world ? Can you give me an idea of how exploration feels ‚Äì what sort of different locations are there ? Are there hidden secrets/collectibles ?
A : Earth Atlantis is an action retro-style shooter with a huge focus on boss battle . We always keep this in mind . So honestly , we never planned to make a huge game or include much adventure game element . This might disappoint many gamers but please do n't expect a lengthy under-sea adventure with tons of puzzles and collectibles .
The game has a HP bar as well a mini map ( although these are n't included in the promotional materials . Earth Atlantis is not a one-shot-kill shooter , and players can take a lot of hits . It 's not really a hardcore shooter , so casual gamers can really enjoy the game
N : Shooters are obviously known for being quite hard . How high is the difficulty in Earth Atlantis ?
A : As I said , Earth Atlantis is not a bullet hell game . Enemies do n't shoot hundreds of bullets all over the screen , so please do n't be afraid . The game has a HP bar as well a mini map ( although these are n't included in the promotional materials . ) Earth Atlantis is not a one-shot-kill shooter , and players can take a lot of hits . It 's not really a hardcore shooter , so casual gamers can really enjoy the game . But if it 's still hard for mainstream gamers , good news ! We have an easy difficulty setting .
Having a game on a Nintendo platform is something very special and personal for me . I hope Nintendo will make it even easier for indie developers to publish games on Nintendo platforms .
N : By reading about it , the game feels like a mix of R-Type , Monster Hunter and Shadow of the Colossus with its boss hunting . What types of games inspired Earth Atlantis ?
A : All the name you mentioned are totally correct . Gradius also hugely inspired the game . We even included an Easter egg inside the game . When you see it , you know it .
Due to some limitations we can not make gigantic bosses just like in Shadow of the Colossus , but maybe for the next game , who knows ?
N : Earth Atlantis of course looks very striking , how did you come up with the idea for the visuals ?
A : I always feel that the old sketch book images of sea monsters from the 14th century are terrifying . I do n't think modern sci-fi monsters can create this kind of fear and horror . Jules Verne 's Novels and illustrations also gave me inspiration ‚Äì fans of their work may discover the submarine ‚Äú Nautilus ‚Äù is not coincidental .
N : What recognition has the game had ?
A : Earth Atlantis won the ‚Äú Excellence in Art ‚Äù award at Busan Indie Connect , South Korea . I was surprised when I heard the announcement ( inside a taxi heading to the Airport . ) I did n't even stay for the award ceremony . I knew that the game art style looked very different , but I did n't expect to win an award for Excellence in Art .
Also , Casual Connect Europe asked us to provide artworks for this year 's program cover . We were so grateful .
N : What has been people 's reception to the game so far ?
A : The reception was fantastic . I saw many young women enjoyed playing the game which is quite surprising . Retro shooters are very niche and the art is very indie . I 've never expected non-hardcore gamers would enjoy this game .
N : When will the game be released ?
A : 3rd quarter of 2017 ( I 'm keeping my fingers crossed ! )
N : Please tell me a little about Pixel Perfex
A : Pixel Perfex is actually a ‚Äú Design Studio ‚Äù . We do character design , CG production and illustrations . I think that played a huge role on the ‚Äú Art and Design ‚Äù direction for the game . We made this game because we felt the concept was very unique and original .
N : And finally , can you see yourself potentially bringing more games to the Switch in the future ?
A : Honestly , I am quite a Nintendo fanboy . All classic shooters I 've played when I was young were on Nintendo game systems ( Gradius , Salamander , TwinBee , Parodius , etc . ) Having a game on a Nintendo platform is something very special and personal for me . I hope Nintendo will make it even easier for a indie developer to publish games on Nintendo platforms .
Fifty years after the Equal Pay Act , the male-female salary gap has narrowed in many occupations.1 Yet pay inequality persists for certain occupations , including medicine and nursing . Studies have documented salary differences across clinical settings for diverse cohorts of physicians2,3 and higher salaries for male registered nurses ( RNs ) .4-6 In nursing , analyses have not considered employment factors that could explain salary differences,6 have been cross-sectional,4,5 and have not been based on recent data . The objective of this study was to examine salaries of males and females in nursing over time and to include a more recent sample .
Methods
We determined salary trends by gender using nationally representative data from the last 6 ( 1988-2008 ) quadrennial National Sample Survey of Registered Nurses ( NSSRN ) ( discontinued in 2008 ) . This mail , electronic , and web survey selected a state-based probability sample of currently licensed RNs from data provided by state boards of nursing with a sample size of more than 30 000 RNs per year and a response rate of approximately 60 % . We also used the American Community Survey ( ACS ; 2001-2013 ) , a household survey with a response rate exceeding 90 % , to extend time trends to 2013 and establish that unadjusted salary differences by gender were not limited to NSSRN data . The sample consisted of full-time employed RNs working 50 or more weeks per year and 35 hours or more per week . The outcome variable of annual salary was measured continuously in both surveys .
Using ordinary least-squares regression and employment information in the NSSRN , we assessed how much of the annual salary differences could be accounted for by demographic factors , work hours , experience , work setting , clinical specialty , job position , survey year , state of residence , and other factors . Analyses were performed using Stata version 13.1 ( StataCorp ) and a 2-tailed probability value of < .05 indicated statistical significance . The study was deemed exempt by a research ethics board .
Results
The NSSRN sample included 87 903 RNs , of whom 6093 ( 7 % ) were men , 10 253 ( 12 % ) were nonwhite , 58 757 ( 67 % ) were married , and 8681 ( 10 % ) had a graduate degree . The mean age was 42 years ( SD , 10.4 years ) . The ACS sample included 205 825 RNs , of whom 20 616 ( 10 % ) were men , 38 482 ( 19 % ) were nonwhite , 134 938 ( 66 % ) were married , and 27 842 ( 14 % ) had a graduate degree . The mean age was 45 years ( SD , 11.4 years ) .
Both surveys showed that unadjusted male salaries were higher than female salaries during every year ( NSSRN , $ 10 775 [ 95 % CI , $ 10 243- $ 11 306 ] , P < .001 ; ACS , $ 9562 [ 95 % CI , $ 9163- $ 9961 ] , P < .001 ; Figure 1 ) . No statistically significant changes in female vs male salary were found over time . Using the NSSRN , regression analysis estimated an overall adjusted earnings difference of $ 5148 ( P < .001 ) .
The salary gap was $ 7678 ( 95 % CI , $ 5319- $ 10 037 ; P < .001 ) for ambulatory care and $ 3873 ( 95 % CI , $ 3144- $ 4601 ; P < .001 ) for hospital settings . The gap was present in all specialties except orthopedics , ranging from $ 3792 ( 95 % CI , $ 802- $ 6781 ; P < .001 ) for chronic care to $ 6034 ( 95 % CI , $ 4175- $ 7893 ; P < .001 ) for cardiology . Salary differences also existed by position , ranging from $ 3956 ( 95 % CI , $ 2174- $ 5737 ; P < .001 ) for middle management to $ 17 290 ( 95 % CI , $ 11 690- $ 22 891 ; P < .001 ) for nurse anesthetists ( Figure 2 ) . The model accounted for half of the variance in salaries ( R2 = 0.46 ) .
Discussion
Male RNs outearned female RNs across settings , specialties , and positions with no narrowing of the pay gap over time . About half of the gap was accounted for by employment and other measured characteristics . This gap is similar in magnitude to the salary differences found for physicians.2,3
Study limitations include survey data that are subject to reporting biases and the lack of detail regarding specialties and positions in the NSSRN .
The roles of RNs are expanding with implementation of the Affordable Care Act and emphasis on team-based care delivery . A salary gap by gender is especially important in nursing because this profession is the largest in health care and is predominantly female , affecting approximately 2.5 million women . These results may motivate nurse employers , including physicians , to examine their pay structures and act to eliminate inequities .

Perhaps the best definition of a Christmas game , Christmas Nights into Dreams was released as a promotional sampler disc during Christmas 1996 for the Sega Saturn . While labeled as a sampler disc containing only new versions of the same stage the disc itself not only came with a cool Christmas theme but a ton of bonus content that never came with the original version of the game . Honestly , it played more like a standalone game than a demo .
The reason it was considered a sample was that it contained the first stage of Claris dream , Spring Valley and both players could play on it . If you selected Elliot you could take a different path that was only on that disc . However , the coolest part was that if you changed the Saturn 's internal clock the game looked different depending on the time you selected .
If it is Christmas , Santa Claus will appear .
If it is New Year 's Day , a message saying : ‚Äú Happy New Year ! ‚Äù will appear .
If it is Valentine 's Day , some hearts will appear .
If it is April Fool 's Day , The player plays as Reala instead of NiGHTS .
During the holiday season , the snow can change depending on what time you set the internal clock to .
Time Effect
3:00 AM ‚Äì Lunar eclipse
6:00 AM ‚Äì Northern Lights
7:00 AM ‚Äì Bright sun
9:00 AM ‚Äì Crescent moons
12:00 PM ‚Äì Rainbows , clouds & confetti
3:00 PM ‚Äì Candy
6:00 PM ‚Äì Strange stars
9:00 PM ‚Äì Bright stars
12:00 AM ‚Äì Hearts
The story takes place after the original Nights and during Christmas time . Elliot & Claris are exploring the Christmas decorated city , but notice the star from the top of the Christmas tree is missing . The duo head off to Nightopia and find NiGHTS to help them retrieve the star . In the end you defeat the boss and find the star , but in the end it was all just a dream .
One of the coolest parts of the disc was depending on when you set the date , the game had the chance to load something other than Christmas Nights . Now the changes were small meaning it only effected the appearance and music of the main game , but still , pretty cool .
NiGHTS : Limited Edition : When played outside the winter season , the game becomes ‚Äú NiGHTS : Limited Edition ‚Äù . The game 's presentation ( title screen , menus and in-game ) is similar to that of the full version of NiGHTS into Dreams with no visual alterations .

Frozen leads Hollywood films in Japanese cinema
Frozen continued its excellent performance in Japanese cinemas last year , newly released figures show , with the Disney animated musical leading the way for Hollywood motion pictures in the country during 2014 .
The 'Let It Go ' favourite has even been credited with helping Japanese venues rake in a healthy rise in ticket sales - a whopping 6.6 per cent increase on 2013 's figures to 207 billion yen .
Frozen , known in Japan as Anna and the Snow Queen , took in more than 25.5 billion yen on its own , becoming the third largest film of all time in Japan and accounting for more than ten per cent of the overall box office takings .
The news will come as good news to Hollywood producers , who are fast losing dominance in Japanese cinema as audiences shun many US superhero and other franchises that have less recognition in the country .
Along with Frozen , Disney 's Maleficent was the second largest foreign film , taking $ 55 million . The film , starring Angelina Jolie , tells the alternate tale of the classic Disney villain and re-imagines them as a protagonist .
Sandra Bullock 's Gravity also did well - the Warner Brothers-distributed film took $ 27 million from Japanese audiences .
Imported films made up 42 per cent of last year 's receipts , lagging local favourites for a seventh straight year and falling well below the peak of 73 per cent , which was seen in 2002 .
For those who want to celebrate Japan 's love of the Frozen phenomenon during their holiday in the country , Tokyo Disneyland is holding daily Frozen-themed parades and events until March , with characters Anna , Elsa and Olaf in attendance .

Get a frosty reception at the Absolut Icebar Tokyo ( 21st April 2009 )
Donald Trump 's personal hideaway at Trump Tower , where he 's costing New York City taxpayers $ 400,000 per day to be protected , has a new selling point : Secret service security .
Real estate brokers are treating the protection as an `` amenity '' for individuals lucky enough to afford to stay there .
Advertisement :
‚Äú Fifth Avenue Buyers Interested in Secret Service Protection ? ‚Äù read the subject heading in an email allegedly sent out by New York real estate agency Douglas Elliman , according to a report by Politico on Tuesday . According to the story , the email advertised a $ 2.1 million , 1,052-square-foot condo in Trump Tower and specifically drew attention to the impending Secret Service protection there as an `` aminity '' [ sic ] .
`` The New Aminity [ sic ] ‚Äì The United States Secret Service , '' the Nov. 13 email allegedly proclaimed , also adding that it was ‚Äú The best value in the most secure building in Manhattan . ''
Whether this was a selling point by the Trump Organization or a rogue real estate agent being tongue-in-cheek is unclear . The Douglas Elliman agency neither confirmed nor denied the story .
In November it came out that renting two vacant floors of the 68-story building and making them operational for the purposes of both the Secret Service and NYPD would cost more than $ 3 million each year .
Although Trump 's name is on Trump Tower , most of the 263 units within the building are individually owned . The Trump Corporation retains a processing fee for unit sales ‚Äî $ 2,000 per application plus $ 250 for each additional adult occupant .
This week , there 's been a bit of a weird news cycle regarding No Man 's Sky , the upcoming space exploration title from Hello Games . Kotaku reported that their sources said the game was being delayed , the writer of that scoop got death threats from the community , and then the rumor was quietly confirmed the next day by the developer . You know , typical video game stuff .
The game has been knocked out of June and pushed back to August 9th , prompting many to speculate on the cause of the delay , which has n't been discussed in either the official announcement , nor even the behind-the-scenes scoop .
Some have worried that the team is scrambling to add in more ‚Äú stuff to do ‚Äù as one of the common complaints is that the objectives of the game seem unfocused and unclear . Others have said that this delay has something to do with PlayStation VR , though the new August date would seem like it would n't be VR-related ( the headset wo n't be out until October ) .
Still , I 'm leaning toward the VR explanation anyway , and what 's clear to me regardless is that No Man 's Sky should absolutely be Sony 's flagship game for PlayStation VR .
So far , the game has only seemed to be toying with the idea of adapting itself for PlayStation VR , but I do n't think I 've ever seen a more obvious fit for a concept + tech . No Man 's Sky is about space exploration , a concept already pioneered by VR versions of EVE and Elite Dangerous , but also about exploring an infinite number of alien planets , something only really glimpsed in a few tech demos so far . It is not the most graphically intensive game on earth thanks to a minimalist art style , which would also help with VR . In short , it 's the perfect title for something like PlayStation VR , and I would not be surprised if Sony was working with Hello Games to try and make this happen .
In my mind , it should n't just be available for PSVR , it should be bundled with it . I have noticed that the current crop of VR headsets do n't really have a killer app , a Wii Sports to their Wii , that immediately and fully shows off why VR is so cool . Not to say the stuff you can play on the Vive and Oculus is n't cool , but to me , No Man 's Sky would be an accessible , instantly transformative experience because of its art and its concept in a way something like the Oculus Dreamdeck just does n't manage to do .
I would not be surprised if the delay is a mix of different factors , last minute work on the core game , but also perhaps laying the groundwork for VR support , which may come a few months after launch . With an August release , players could play the game on PS4 normally for a while , then possibly experience it in VR after that . Ultimately , if the game was rolled into a bundle , it could become perhaps the first truly iconic VR title , a crown I 'm not sure any other game can claim at this point .
I am getting a bit ahead of things . No Man 's Sky first has to prove it 's a fundamentally good game . At this point , there has been so much hype about the game for so long , that I think most fans are finally starting to lower their expectations a bit to be less stratospheric than they were previously . Hype can only be sustained for so long , and I think No Man 's Sky has run out of gas in that regard . But honestly , that may not be a bad thing , as if expectations are now being managed properly , it may very well have the capacity to surprise us .
But this is why I think VR would work so well here . To be frank , we expect less of a ‚Äú game ‚Äù out of VR games . It 's why people can just sit inside looping video demos for ages , or sit and stare at Oculus 's peaceful menu/home `` environment . '' Yes , there are plenty of ‚Äú game ‚Äù games for the various headsets , but almost all are far less complex than traditional PC or console titles . No Man 's Sky seems like it might be too slow and simple for the core PC/console audience , but for VR ? Mild combat , resource collection , and most importantly , just exploring these virtual worlds is the right level of content for that platform , from what I 've experienced so far .
I do n't think No Man 's Sky will be the prince that was promised , but nor do I think it will be some giant disaster either . I think a very small studio got thrust into a very big spotlight , which is why development has seemed so wonky , but fundamentally , I think we 'll end up with a good game out of it . But honestly , we might end up with one of our first truly great VR games if they can manage to get it right , and that 's more exciting than anything .

Why does The Walking Dead have such lasting appeal ? Find out below :
Harm 's Way grew out of Chicago 's dynamic hardcore community in the mid-00s , gradually delving deep into metallic terrain with an icy , industrialized aggression that nodded at bands like Godflesh and Celtic Frost while still bearing the stamp of its roots . After a number of releases , including the pulverizing Isolation LP on Closed Casket Activities in 2011 , the four-piece signed to Deathwish where it unleashed the Blinded EP in 2013 , further cementing its reputation as a heavy band on the rise .
On March 10 , Harm 's Way will release its latest LP , Rust . Recorded with Andy Nelson ( Weekend Nachos ) at Bricktop Recordings , mixed by Converge guitarist Kurt Ballou ( High on Fire , Kvelertak ) at GodCity Studios , and mastered by Brad Boatright ( Nails , Old Man Gloom ) at Audiosiege , the album finds Harm 's Way at its tightest and most muscular ( you ca n't talk Harms Way without talking muscles , or so the blogosphere 's fixation on frontman James Pligge 's physique would have you believe ) , carefully stripping away any extraneous noise or atmospherics to give way to pure , molten brutality . The music 's considerable heft is heightened by Pliggue 's lyrics that mix introspective gloom with world-weary struggle , loss , and death , and helped provide inspiration for the ambitious , multi-piece album art designed by E. Aaron Ross .
To coincide with the release of its most aggressive record to date , Harm 's Way has embarked on an equally aggressive tour cycle that stretches across Southeast Asia , Australia , and North America , before crossing the Atlantic where the band will join labelmates Converge , Trap Them , and Young And In The Way for Deathwish Fest Europe . I caught up with drummer Chris Mills ( who is a social worker by day ) as Harm 's Way was preparing to leave town to learn more about the painstaking process behind the new record , finding catharsis through heavy music , and the band members ' evolving , but constant balancing act .
Listen to a new song , `` Law of the Land , '' below ...
Noisey : Over the years your sound has changed . How did you get to where you are now , in terms of the stylistic evolution of the band ?
Mills : When the band started we were more of a fast hardcore / powerviolence band . We were all in a band called Few and the Proud at the time and we decided to do Harm 's Way as a side project because we wanted to see James sing for a band and we wanted to play 30-second fast powerviolence songs in the vein of Infest and Crossed Out . The band was n't necessarily a serious thing , it was something to have fun with . The more and more we kept playing with one another and the more records we put out , the more serious the band became . It 's always evolving based on what we 're involved in at the moment and what we are listening to . That 's apparent in the sound , but we 've matured as individuals as the sound of the band has matured .
It 's always interesting to speak with musicians who were born and raised here in Chicago . What do you think makes the Chicago hardcore community unique ?
Hardcore in Chicago definitely has its niches from more heavy , beatdown hardcore to fast punk . We came to hardcore from punk‚Ä¶ It was n't until later on that we started getting into heavier hardcore and metal . Hardcore in Chicago is pretty diverse and that 's something we all experienced growing up , going to killer shows , and Punch in the Face and Repos shows . It was good to be exposed to a diverse range of hardcore and punk in the city ... As I get older , I see more divisions within punk and hardcore in Chicago . You do n't have as much intermeshing . You can kind of see that with Harm 's Way 's fanbase . When we started we were playing to a completely different crowd and as we 've pushed more outside the boundaries and boxes of hardcore , our fanbase has changed .
Tell me a little about how you pieced the new record together .
Lyrics are primarily from James , our singer . The music is a collaborative process where someone will bring a skeleton of a song and we 'll all sit down together and jam it , and each of us contributes in some way , shape , or form to the songwriting process . Rust is probably our most collaborative record yet . We spent a lot of time writing new songs , demoing new songs , revisiting the songs , and rehashing the songs . We tried to really think out this record , more so than any record we 've done in the past . We were really mindful of how the songs came together and the presentation .
We spent a lot of time in pre-production phase writing the songs and demoing the songs in our guitar player 's house . Finally , eleven months down the line we went to the studio . We probably spent the most time in the studio with this record , maybe nine or ten days , where before we 'd spend four to five days . We really took our time and tried to hone in and focus on every layer of every song . All of us have jobs outside of the band so not only were we in the studio , but we were working nine to five and coming to the studio later in the day .
That 's a pretty crazy cycle . Do you think it made the record more intense ?
The band is pretty cathartic for many of us . It offers a release from our daily lives and rituals . It definitely was stressful and took a lot of hard work , but it was something we looked forward to , even though a lot of those days blended together and there were many nights we did n't sleep as much as we probably should have .
Your day job is in social work . Are you currently working as a social worker or are you still in school ?
I finished my Master 's degree back in June and I currently work at a couple of different agencies as a social worker and a substance abuse counselor . The band is something I had to balance . We all have to balance it with other aspects of our lives .
There 's a contrast between social work and working towards positive change and then with Harm 's Way where the lyrics and music are pretty bleak . In talking about balance , is the band an outlet for a different type of energy for you , or do you find that one world informs the other ?
Yeah , it definitely is a `` both / and '' kind of thing for myself and probably for the rest of us . The band is pretty bleak and pretty dark at times , but that 's just the way we see life in general . Things ca n't always be positive and things are n't always going to go your way . There needs to be a contrast . This `` both / and '' philosophy needs to be accepted to move closer to peace , so to speak . The band is definitely an outlet when it comes to releasing negative energy and fulfilling needs in my life aside from what social work does for me and the relationships I 'm able to develop with my clients and people I work with .
Blinded seems to revolve around a central theme about the mind , vision , and perception . Am I reading into Rust too much to suggest that it follows a central theme as well ?
Yeah , there 's definitely a theme with Rust where it kind of works around the analogy of rusting and how we all kind of `` rust '' throughout life , and eventually lose our lives . There are definitely specific themes regarding loss and personal struggle , trying to find your place in the world , trying to navigate failure and success , and navigate with what life throws you and the challenges we face on a day-to-day basis .
You 've been playing with some of these guys since you were teenagers . How has the relationship changed in playing music with the same people for that long ?
We 're all really close , we 're all best friends . You start to understand each other that way , as far as songwriting and playing with one another is concerned . It 's definitely made things easier for us as a band , coming to agreements and taking chances together . Whether it 's touring for the next six months , or writing songs that do n't necessarily fit with what people know your band is . You grow more comfortable and you grow and mature together . That 's something we 've definitely done over the years .
We do n't consciously say , `` We need to write a song that sounds like this , '' or `` We need to have record sound like that . '' There are so many songs that we scrapped with Rust and so many parts that got scrapped as well . Rust could have come out as a completely different record if we just went with what we wrote up front at that time . We let things come organically and evolve . We spent a lot of time just thinking this stuff through once the groundwork was set for these songs .
Maybe this was unintentional , but the title , Rust , made me think of industrial machinery and these harsh , grimey noises . As a listener , it seemed like a really appropriate title .
That was definitely a secondary acknowledgement . It was kind of cool and kind of unintentional , and it further came to fruition with the album artwork and the visual direction of the record . It was one of those `` ah ha ! '' moments . `` This is all making sense now . ''
Something people will probably recognize that off the bat is that the record cover looks like nothing we 've ever done before . Once people unfold the record‚Äîit has a die-cut sleeve and a gatefold‚Äîthey 'll find pieces that bring everything together .
Blinded seems like sort of the link between the previous records and this one . Do you feel as if you 're ushering in a new era ?
It 's definitely a step in a different direction for us and it can definitely be seen as a new era for the band , but we like to think that we 're always continuing to evolve . It will be interesting to see what happens next .

A group of researchers has won a grant to research and develop a modified CPU that can help detect malware and other security anomalies .
The two collaborating teams , at Binghamton University and the University of California-Riverside , believe that a hardware solution is necessary to help mitigate security threats instead of relying entirely on software . The project has been dubbed the ‚Äú Practical Hardware-Assisted Always-On Malware Detection ‚Äù and the three-year grant of $ 275,000 was awarded by the National Science Foundation .
Typically we rely on anti-virus or anti-malware software to scan and detect threats on our computers . The researchers say that they will investigate ways of modifying a computer 's central processing unit that will involve adding ‚Äú logic ‚Äù to spot anomalies while running programs . They envision the hardware solution as a ‚Äú lookout , ‚Äù which will complement the work of software .
‚Äú This project holds the promise of significantly impacting an area of critical national need to help secure systems against the expanding threats of malware , ‚Äù explained Dmitry Ponomarev , professor of computer science at Binghamton University , the project 's principal investigator .
‚Äú The modified microprocessor will have the ability to detect malware as programs execute by analyzing the execution statistics over a window of execution , ‚Äù they added . The researchers admit that no solution they develop will work 100 percent of the time but it is rather intended as an extra layer of defense .
When the hardware component , which will be powered by machine learning , triggers a threat it will alert a ‚Äú heavyweight software detector ‚Äù to carry out further analysis and take action .
‚Äú The hardware guides the operation of the software ; without the hardware the software will be too slow to work on all programs all the time , ‚Äù said Ponomarev .
‚Äú The hardware detector 's role is to find suspicious behavior and better direct the efforts of the software . ‚Äù
Recently the researchers publicly disclosed a serious hardware security vulnerability that allowed them to disable the Address Space Layout Randomization ( ASLR ) component of an operating system . ASLR randomizes where data is stored on a computer . By disabling this function , a hacker could gain root access to a system and take full control of the computer .
The research was carried out on a Linux system with Intel processors but they claimed that the attack is possible on Windows , Android , and virtualization systems like KVM as well .
Share . Could this be the reveal of PlayStation Neo ? Could this be the reveal of PlayStation Neo ?
Sony has confirmed , in an invitation provided to IGN , that the company will hold a PlayStation-focused event in New York this September .
The invitation does not elaborate on what will be specifically discussed at the event , which will be held in New York at the PlayStation Theater on September 7 at 3 p.m . ET . The invitation reads :
`` We hope to see you there , and we ca n't wait to share details with you about the PlayStation business . ''
Recent reports earlier this week from both Gameblog and Vice Gaming revealed that Sony had a September 7 event in the works before Sony sent out the invitations . Anonymous sources spoke to both websites , saying that the event will be focused around a `` technical showcase '' of the upcoming 20054834 '' target= '' _blank '' > PlayStation Neo .
Vice 's report also states that final development kits will be sent to developers for the Neo around the time of the conference .
Exit Theatre Mode
Prior to E3 , Sony Interactive president Andrew House confirmed the existence of the Neo , but the console was not shown during the annual gaming convention .
`` It is intended to sit alongside and complement the standard PS4 , ‚Äù House said at the time . ‚Äú We will be selling both [ versions ] through the life cycle . ''
House also confirmed at the time that all games will support both the standard PS4 and the Neo , and both will support PlayStation VR .
Stay tuned to IGN for more on the event .

After Congress left town and snow showers arrived Thursday , children and adults descended , toting their sleds to make use of the literal hill at the Capitol . The Capitol police tried to turn them away .
`` We ask people not to sled on Capitol grounds , '' a police officer , appearing on the west lawn of the Capitol building , said to one sledder . A scrum of reporters and their cameras hovered close to the police officer , who was dressed in snow gear and wearing dark sunglasses in spite of the overcast sky .
The man they were speaking with , Tim Krepp , a one-time candidate for the District of Columbia 's delegate seat in Congress , nodded their head as they listened but did n't back down .
`` We 've been sledding here for many years now . This is kind of a silly problem to have , '' Krepp said in response . Behind the father of two , a crowd convened , holding hand-made signs that read `` Sled free or die . ''
It was the latest episode in the District of Columbia 's ongoing snow saga , where sledders have repeatedly faced off against Capitol police over the sledding ban .
Effectively enforced after 9/11 , Section 16.5 in the U.S. Capitol Police Traffic Regulations specifically prohibits winter sports on the grounds -- sledding included . The U.S. House code dates back further , saying , `` It shall be the duty of the Capitol police on and after April 29 , 1876 , to prevent any portion of the Capitol Grounds and terraces from being used as playgrounds or otherwise , so far as may be necessary to protect the public property , turf and grass from destruction or injury . ''
Police discourage sledding on Capitol Hill
Congresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton , the District 's non-voting delegate in the House of Representatives , started a campaign to lift the ban .
`` Families have started calling my office because they do not want to be turned away once again from sledding on U.S. Capitol Grounds , '' Norton wrote in a plea to Capitol Police and the Sergeant-at-Arms .
Norton was n't the only one clamoring for better sledding conditions : House members like Rep. Harry Reid , R-Nevada , sent some supportive Tweets their way , while a Change.org petition to lift the sled ban garnered hundreds of signatures .
`` Have a heart , Mr. Larkin , '' Norton implored . `` A kid 's heart , that is . ''
But Capitol Police stood firm .
They denied the member of congress 's request , saying , `` [ T ] he Board can not grant exceptions , '' though they would continue to review the traffic regulations and update `` as necessary . ''
Norton was `` deeply disappointed '' with the police board but undaunted .
`` The nation 's capital is teeming with families and young children who are the latest generation to regard sledding on 'America 's front lawn ' during our rare snowstorms as one of our oldest and best traditions , '' Norton said in a responding statement . `` I have not asked for unfettered or unregulated sledding . Rather , I have requested reasonable regulation of sledding to replace the absolute ban . I do not believe that is too much to ask for the Capitol Grounds , which are used for walking dogs and other activities , in a city that has so few snowfalls that can accommodate sledding . ''
And the sledders came anyway . Protests over the ban snowballed into civil disobedience , culminating in a protest on Capitol Hill .
`` Despite efforts , the sled ban has not been waived for this weekend , '' a popular D.C. neighborhood blog , Prince of Petworth , announced Thursday morning . `` But if you are up for a little civil disobedience , a sled-in is planned for today at 1pm . West lawn of the Capitol . Come armed with sleds ! ''
Lyndsey Medsker , a public affairs specialist , brought their two young sons to the slopes Thursday . Them family had tried two weeks ago to sled down Capitol Hill during Washington 's last snowstorm . But Medsker 's children , Finley and Atley , were only able to get a couple of runs in before Capitol Police ordered them to disperse .
They organized the `` Sled-In '' after hearing that their online petition had failed to sway Capitol Police .
Though a Capitol Hill officer confronted the sled enthusiasts about the ban , the police made no arrests , and D.C. 's delegate rejoiced .
No enforcement of # sledding ban on Capitol Hill today , '' Norton announced on Twitter . `` Thank you Capitol Police ! ''
It was n't the first time the Capitol softened on enforcing the ban . During President 's Day weekend in 2010 , then-Senator Chris Dodd , D-Connecticut , successfully petitioned Capitol Police to stop enforcing the sledding ban .
`` At Snowmaggedon , Senator Dodd got the architect of the capitol to let us do it , '' Jody Pratt , a mother and D.C. resident , said as they stood with their sled outside the Capitol building .
`` I think if you look around , you will see a lot of kids sledding and having fun in the snow , '' Medsker , the Change.org petitioner , said . They pointed out their own two children perched atop a bright orange sled . `` And that was the entire intent of all of this . ''
Italy might have just become a smaller concern for investors after the constitutional court ruled on changes to the country 's electoral law .
Analysts believe that a court ruling , published Wednesday , will make the Italian electoral system more proportionate and thus , less likely , to give room for a government led by the populist and anti-euro Five-Star Movement ( M5S ) .
`` Even if the anti-Euro M5S emerges as the largest party in the next elections , it will not obtain a parliamentary majority given the strongly proportional system , '' Wolfango Piccoli , co-President of Teneo Intelligence , said in a note .
`` As a result , the M5S would be able to take over power only if it strikes a coalition deal with other parties . This is a near-impossible task for M5S given its intransigence in dealing with other political forces in order to preserve its 'anti-establishment ' identity , '' Piccoli added .
Italy is being governed by an interim executive since the resignation of former prime minister Matteo Renzi .
President Sergio Matarella wants the electoral law approved before calling for new elections .
Like in other European countries , support for anti-euro movements has risen since the 2008 financial crisis ‚Äì something that investors interpret as a worry when looking at opportunities in Italy .
But the increased proportionality in the Italian system makes it now harder for populists to take over the next government .
Woody Allen Fan Rankings 2017 Results ! This is part 3 , and you can find part 1 here and part 2 here .
Here 's the pointy end ‚Äì the top 10 !
10 . Zelig ( 1983 , 385 points )
It may be Allen 's shortest film , but there 's plenty to love . In fact , it was overwhelming loves ( 28 % ) , bests ( 23 % ) and likes ( 23 % ) . This is definitely one of those films we know fans love but is n't really talked about .
9 . Deconstructing Harry ( 1997 , 391 points )
A huge surprise . Not only Allen 's best film of the 90s , a decade that did very well in our poll . But in the top 10 ! 24 % of you said this was amongst Allen 's very best , and plenty of more positives drove it to be a fan favourite . I would not have bet money on this being a top 10 but there you go .
8 . Match Point ( 2005 , 428 points )
The 00s were a bad run , but this film still stands up . 31 % of you loved it , and 27 % consider it the very best . Quite a few detractors , but the positivity votes win out .
7 . Blue Jasmine ( 2013 , 439 points )
Another late period classic . Actually not many of you count this as Allen 's best ( 20 % ) , but the other positive votes overwhelmed the almost no negative votes . And 89 % of you have seen it .
6 . The Purple Rose Of Cairo ( 1985 , 459 points )
Allen 's apparently personal favourite just misses out on the top 5 . Most of you love it ( 33 % ) and many of you loved it too ( 27 % ) . Very solid scoring , and a happy minor surprise .
5 . Crimes And Misdemeanors ( 1989 , 531 points )
Allen 's best serious drama , one of their most acclaimed . We kinda thought it would be higher . But a huge 44 % of you thought this was amongst Allen 's very best , and that 's where it ended up .
4 . Hannah And Them Sisters ( 1984 , 552 points )
Allen maintains their ending made it too crowd pleasing , and it 's true , cos the crowd was certainly pleased . 44 % of you think this is the best , and 91 % of you have seen it and 0 % hate , 0 % worse‚Ä¶it 's a winner .
3 . Midnight In Paris ( 2011 , 564 points )
What a surprise . But you all seemed to think this was a great film . 97 % of you have seen it , and 76 % loved it or thought it was the best . That it comes in third is a big result . Maybe it 's recency bias , but maybe we need to start calling this one of Allen 's very greats .
2 . Manhattan ( 1979 , 605 points )
It was always going to be one or two , and in the end despite 49 % of you saying it was amongst their best , it managed to come in second . The voting logic probably worked against this one ‚Äì there was no way to rate it above Annie Hall . It is still the clear second , and a classic by anyone 's standards .
1 . Annie Hall ( 1977 , 675 points )
There was a moment where it was close , but this film pulled away and was far and away your favourite . And really , it is not a shocking result at all . 62 % of you rank this as Allen 's best , and you are totally right . It celebrates 40 years this year !
Thanks to everyone who voted . We might not run this every year , but we will definitely run this again at some point . We might muck about with how the votes work . Let us know what you think of the results !
For the second year in a row , ten new nuclear reactors started to generate electricity in 2016 , the highest number since the 1980s , according to the 2017 edition of the IAEA 's Nuclear Power Reactors in the World .
As of 31 December 2016 , 448 reactors were in operation worldwide , with a net capacity of 391GW of electricity , the highest in history . Within the same period , three reactors were permanently shut down and 61 nuclear reactors were under construction . Two reactors remain in long-term shut down .
‚Äú In the past two years 20 new nuclear power reactors were connected to the grid and started producing electricity . This demonstrates the important role that nuclear power continues to play in meeting growing energy demand throughout the world , ‚Äù said Mikhail Chudakov , IAEA Deputy Director General and Head of the Department of Nuclear Energy .
This reference guide provides global data on new nuclear power plants as well as details on the various types of reactors in operation , Chudakov highlighted .
This is the 37th edition of Reference Data Series No.2 , which summarizes information on power reactors in operation , under construction and shut down as well as performance data of operational reactors in IAEA Member States . It also includes data on the types of reactors , nuclear electricity production , the categories of new reactors connected to the grid , technical terms used during the decommissioning process of reactors , and the specification and performance history data of operating reactors .
The information is collected through designated national counterparts in Member States who feed to the IAEA 's Power Reactor Information System ( PRIS ) . PRIS is home to the most current and frequently updated figures on nuclear reactors in the world , also with details on country levels .
Nuclear power can deliver a steady baseload supply of electricity needed to power a modern economy . It is generally competitive , offers a low cost , reliable long term source of electricity , and has a good operational record . NPPs produce virtually no greenhouse gas emissions or air pollutants during their operation and have only very low emissions over their entire life cycle .
The IAEA provides assistance and information to countries that are considering introduction of nuclear power . It helps interested Member States to develop their energy planning capabilities and establish the necessary infrastructure for a safe , secure and sustainable nuclear power programme .
SASARAM : With the amendment in Bihar Finance Rule 2001 effective from July 29 this year , Bihar has become the first state in the country where a male purchasing land or building to gift it to someone will have to pay more registration fee if the seller is a female . The state government has , however , given relaxation in registration fee to a woman if they purchase the same from a male . And in case of seller and purchaser both being female , there will be no relaxation in the registration fee.Sources in the state registration department said two days after the state cabinet decision to amend the Bihar Finance Rule 2001 , the registration department on July 29 issued a notification to this effect . So far a purchaser irrespective of gender had to pay 8 % including 6 % as stamp duty of total cost of the land , as registration fee.But after the amendment , in case of the seller being a woman , the male purchaser will have to pay 8.4 % as registration fee . But in case of male seller , a female purchaser will get a relaxation of 0.4 % in registration fee . Also if the name of a male figures along with a female in the column of purchaser , there will be no relaxation in the registration fee . A male family member and relative will have to pay more than registration fee if a woman gifts their immovable property to him .
Hey ladies ! Have you ever gotten a song really stuck in your head ? I have , so I tried to get it out by writing it on my nails . Turns out , it only gets stuck even worse ! So do n't try this at home XD But do click here to read more ! So it 's inspired by the song 'Under The Sea ' from The Little Mermaid ! Sebastian ( that 's the crab ) sings a song to them about how they should stay underwater and not go out onto the shore , because everything is way better under the sea . The way they say it : `` Life is deh bubbles ! Under the sea . '' And they have an accent , so 'the ' sound like 'deh ' so that 's how I spelled it ! This was crazy fun to make , I 'm telling you ! I was in a super good mood and I used the new nail art brushes that I got from my mom for Valentine 's Day ( is n't they a super sweetie ? ? ? ) .The letters were easy , I just painted them on . I typed out my text on the computer and picked out a nice font , so I had an example to go by.The bubbles were pretty easy too , they go like this : You water down acrylic paint and you put a drop on your nail . Wait a minute , then drain the middle part of the water by putting a brush , a cotton swab or something else on it . I used a piece of tissue paper because it sucks out the water easily and I can make super small pointy bits with it .
Frederick the Great at Peace -- Not Germany
About 1,500 protesters , including a mock funeral party , opposed the ceremony , especially the participation of an eight-member Bundeswehr honor guard and Chancellor Helmut Kohl , who interrupted their Austrian vacation `` to pay my respects . ''
Unification of the two Germanys made the kings ' final journey possible from the ancestral castle of the Hohenzollern dynasty in the south to the rococo Sans Souci in what used to be the Communist east . But public opinion about `` Old Fritz '' and Prussia was anything but united on the anniversary of their death in 1786 .
The sarcophagi of Frederick II and their father , the `` soldier king '' Frederick William I ( Friedrich Wilhelm ) , arrived in Potsdam aboard a vintage train . They were then carried by horse-drawn wagon to the castle grounds , where thousands of spectators waited in a hissing rain .
POTSDAM , Germany ‚Äî The remains of Frederick the Great were returned to their beloved Sans Souci palace Saturday for burial alongside their faithful greyhounds , fulfilling the Prussian king 's last wish 205 years late in a Germany still wrestling with the militaristic image that was their legacy .
`` Today It 's Old Fritz 's Bones -- In the Next War , It 's Yours , '' read one protester 's banner . Others shouted slogans such as `` Nazis out ! '' Outside the palace gates , a smiling youth handed out neo-Nazi leaflets announcing the founding of the United States of the German East in the German Reich and demanding the return of all prewar German territories .
Scuffles broke out between small numbers of demonstrators , police and counter-demonstrators , but no arrests or injuries were reported , authorities said .
Saturday 's reinterment was viewed by critics -- among them many historians , clergy and liberals -- as a `` state funeral '' for a monarch who expanded their realm through three of their era 's bloodiest wars , molding Prussia into a state that became synonymous with military might .
Adolf Hitler later appropriated the Prussian tradition for their Nazi troops . Hitler so admired Frederick the Great and their father that they ordered their remains hidden in a salt mine when Allied bombs began falling near Potsdam .
The Americans found the remains and moved them to what became West Germany , where they remained until Saturday .
By nightfall , police estimated that 80,000 people had filed past Frederick the Great 's casket , draped with the black-and-white Prussian flag beneath a black canopy in the palace courtyard . The parade of spectators ranged from shutter-bug tourists in shorts and sandals to members of military and historical societies in plumed uniforms , who lowered their sabers to the ground to honor the former king . Viewing was extended 90 minutes to accommodate the crowds .
`` Militarism is not good , but what 's wrong with tradition ? '' asked Ilona Seiler , a 53-year-old Potsdam grandmother who came with their daughter-in-law and young grandson . `` It 's a part of history . We told my grandson the king was coming back home , '' they said .
`` He belongs here , '' said Gerd Dammhayn , a 49-year-old engineer who drove nearly three hours from Leipzig to see the spectacle . `` Frederick the Great is a part of our history . It 's not a question of being ashamed of them or proud of him . ''
In a small , private ceremony at the New Palace at Sans Souci , public officials also remembered Frederick the Great 's more positive contributions , such as abolishing torture and granting sanctuary to Jews , Huguenots and other religious refugees .
The comments apparently were an attempt to calm any concerns of a Prussian revival , particularly in eastern Germany , where violent gangs of neo-Nazis and skinheads are growing .
Descendants of the once-royal Hohenzollern family planned a private burial of Frederick the Great on the terrace at midnight , in accordance with their last will and testament . They had also demanded a funeral `` without pomp , without ostentation and without the least ceremony . ''
Frederick William I was reinterred in a royal mausoleum on the palace grounds earlier in the day .

Next-generation space tech is going to be tested here in Bucks .
A multi-million pound test facility is opening at Westcott near Aylesbury .
A new rocket engine is the kit being experimented with .
The test facility will enable Reaction Engines to test critical subsystems along with the testing of a SABRE engine core , which will commence in 2020 .
What 's being created ?
# SABRETF1 will have a control room , a new workshop , assembly and office area alongside the test facility pic.twitter.com/Pdl7rkAcA9 ‚Äî Reaction Engines Ltd ( @ ReactionEngines ) May 4 , 2017
The project represents a substantial investment for Reaction Engines , which will consist of a multi-purpose propulsion test stand designed to accommodate various test engine configurations , an assembly building , workshops , offices and control room .
The location of workshops and other support facilities alongside the test stand will enable configuration changes to the engine to take place at the site , reducing the downtime between testing phases and accelerating the development programme of the SABRE engine .
Work begins
To mark the start of construction , Mark Thomas , CEO , Reaction Engines undertook a groundbreaking ceremony with Franco Ongaro , Director of Technology , Engineering and Quality , European Space Agency ( ESA ) ; Dr. Chris Castelli , Director , Programmes , UK Space Agency and Richard Harrington , CEO , Buckinghamshire Thames Valley LEP .
Mark Thomas , CEO , Reaction Engines said :
‚Äú This is another exciting step forward in development of Reaction Engines ' SABRE engine and a visible demonstration of the UK 's commitment to the programme . `` I look forward to seeing this unique facility take shape and commencing our core engine testing , which will be a defining moment for aerospace . ‚Äù
Franco Ongaro , Director of Technology , Engineering and Quality , ESA said :
‚Äú The opening of this new test facility at Westcott Today marks an historical moment for the European Aerospace industry and for the UK research and development in rocket propulsion . `` This facility will enable the ground test of the SABRE engine cycle , opening the way to the first flight tests , and to a new era . `` The European Space Agency is proud of this partnership with industry and the UK Space Agency , to which we bring our technical competence , which has supported the SABRE development to this stage , and we are confident , to its future flight success . ‚Äù
The construction of the SABRE engine test facility is a significant milestone .
The company has already successfully undertaken testing of the engine 's pre-cooler and thrust chamber technologies , and will undertake further ground-based high-temperature testing of the pre-cooler early in 2018 .
The test facility is located in the Westcott Venture Park , a location with a strong history of rocket propulsion research , having been used to test various UK rocket projects since 1946 , including the Blue Streak and Black Arrow programmes .
In 2016 the UK Space Agency selected Westcott as the UK 's National Space Propulsion Test Facility and the site is now home to a number of space propulsion and satellite technology companies .
What is SABRE ?
# SABRETF1 is a unique facility to test the revolutionary SABRE engine . Next generation # space access and hypersonics # maythefourthbewithyou pic.twitter.com/IcqKVmqJmq ‚Äî Reaction Engines Ltd ( @ ReactionEngines ) May 4 , 2017
SABRE is an innovative new class of aerospace propulsion that has the potential to provide efficient air-breathing thrust from standstill on the runway to speeds above five times the speed of sound in the atmosphere .
A SABRE engine can then transition to a rocket mode of operation , allowing spaceflight at up to orbital velocity , equivalent to twenty five times the speed of sound .
Through its ability to ‚Äò breathe ' air from the atmosphere , SABRE offers a significant reduction in propellant consumption and weight compared to conventional rocket engines which have to carry their own oxygen .
Ground test and development programme
There are three core building blocks to the SABRE engine technology , the pre-cooler , the engine core and the thrust chamber .
Each of these systems can be developed and validated using ground based demonstrations which saves cost and time relative to flight test , a design feature that benefitted the development of the piston/propeller and jet engine .
Reaction Engines plan to mature each of these independently over the next four years , with a high temperature test of the pre-cooler planned early 2018 .
Investment
Reaction Engines has received significant capital from private investors and public funding , which will support its transition from a successful research phase into development and testing of the engine . In 2013 , the UK Government announced a ¬£60m commitment to aid preparations for the design , manufacture and testing of a SABRE demonstrator engine .
In 2015 , the Company announced that BAE Systems had made a strategic investment in the company and committed to a working collaboration to accelerate the development of the engine .
Orbital Launch Vehicles
As a step change in propulsion , SABRE-class engines have the potential to truly revolutionise the space launch industry .
The high efficiency of a SABRE engine and the elimination of the need to carry on-board oxidizer during air-breathing flight segments , enable the development of single stage or two stage space launch system with aircraft-like horizontal take-off and landing operations , resulting in lower cost infrastructure , and mission timelines while increasing responsiveness and system reusability .
In addition , SABRE powered launch vehicles can be designed with the ability to abort their mission and return to base- an attribute that will drive significant improvements in the reliability of space launch

The SABRE-class is capable of achieving air-breathing flight from Mach 0 to Mach 5+ as a single propulsion installation and is well suited for a variety of potential high-speed mission areas . SABRE enables more capable high-speed vehicles to be designed and the engine 's rocket mode adds the additional flexibility to increase thrust or transition to sub-orbital flight .
Hypersonic Transport
SABRE-class engines have the potential to make the world smaller through high-speed point-to-point transport .
To demonstrate the uses for SABRE engine technology in Mach 5 cruise applications , Reaction Engines engaged in a 50 % EU-funded project as part of Framework 6 , called LAPCAT ‚Äî Long-term Advanced Propulsion Concepts and Technologies .
This study examined the technologies required to reduce long-distance flights , e.g . From Brussels to Sydney , to just over 4 hours while cruising at Mach 5 .
Other applications
Reaction Engines heat exchanger technology has the potential to revolutionise the approach to thermal management across a range of industries , from aerospace to motorsport , industrial processes , and the energy sector .

The scope of Barack Obama 's victory in Iowa has shaken the Clinton machine down to its bolts . Donors are panicking . The campaign has been making a round of calls to reassure notoriously fickle `` superdelegates '' ¬ó elected officials and party regulars who are awarded convention spots by virtue of their titles and positions ¬ó who might be reconsidering their decisions to back the candidate who formerly looked like a sure winner . And internally , a round of recriminations is being aimed at their chief strategist , Mark Penn , as the representative of everything about their pseudo-incumbent campaign that has been too cautious , too arrogant , too conventional and too clueless as to how much the political landscape has shifted since the last Clinton reign . One adviser summed up the biggest challenge that faces the campaign in two words : `` Fresh thinking . ''
Specifically , those inside the campaign and outside advisers fault Penn for failing to see the Iowa defeat coming . They say they were assuring Clinton and their allies right up until the caucuses that they would win it . Says one : `` He did not predict in any way , shape or form the tidal wave we saw . '' In particular , they had assured them that Clinton 's support among women would carry them through . Yet they managed to win only 30 % of the women 's vote , while 35 % of them went for Obama .
A modest rise in Iowa turnout from traditional levels ¬ó say by about 20,000 or 30,000 ¬ó might have been easy to write off as merely the result of superior tactics on the part of the well-funded Obama operation . But the fact that voters flooded the caucuses , and that Obama swept just about every demographic group , speaks to something larger that is going on in the electorate , Clinton strategists now acknowledge .
That leaves them facing problems on two levels . The first , and easier one to grapple with , is how to deal with Obama . Even as the results in Iowa were still coming in , the Clinton campaign was mobilizing onto an attack footing . But it 's possible that the most difficult problem is not Obama ; it could be Clinton . How can they retool their message ¬ó and their identity as a virtual incumbent ¬ó to resonate with an electorate that seems to yearn more for change than any other quality ? Says one longtime Democratic strategist , who is close to the Clintons : `` Fundamentally , they are who they are ; they ca n't change who they are , and maybe this is not their time . ''
There are senior officials within the campaign ¬ó notably , outside advisers say , media consultant Mandy Grunwald and adviser Harold Ickes ¬ó who have been worried for months that Clinton was missing the fundamental shift in the electorate . However , their entreaties have gone nowhere . Bill and Hillary Clinton have put enormous faith in Penn , and given them veto power , aides say , over every word that goes into their television ads and every line in their mailers . `` He had them and the President 's trust very deeply , '' says one adviser who is close to the campaign . Adds another : `` He 's a one-man shop . ''
If Clinton also loses New Hampshire to Obama , Penn 's future with the campaign may well be in jeopardy , strategists say . But that may be wishful thinking on their part . For one thing , there is no obvious candidate to replace him . Hillary 's advisers and Bill 's have never gotten along ¬ó and they have been particularly suspicious of their team . `` Who they both trust ¬ó that 's a very small group , '' says one former Clinton aide . `` She is going to be very , very resistant to all of the white boys coming back . ''
Another problem is that some of those who might potentially be brought in have already been sidelined . Former White House Chief of Staff John Podesta , for instance , is running a 527 organization called the Fund for America and is forbidden by law to even consult with the campaign .
But everyone is aware that a victory by Obama in New Hampshire on Tuesday could accelerate a dynamic that could become very difficult to overcome as the campaign moves on . In South Carolina , which holds its primary on Jan. 26 , half the Democratic electorate is African-American ; though many have been wary of Obama 's chances so far , that could change if they start to pile up victories . Clinton might instead focus their attention on Nevada , which holds its caucus a week earlier , in hopes of snaring a victory there on presumably friendlier turf . But if Obama continues to gain strength ¬ó particularly in the face of attacks by Clinton 's campaign ¬ó they undercut their argument that they are the strongest and most electable candidate . And if they can stand up to the assault of the Clinton machine , it will also make them look more formidable against the Republican one .
Rian Johnson weighs in on why they chose to shoot at Ireland 's Skellig Michael instead of on a soundstage : `` I 'm sure it would have been more economical , but it was so worth it to do it the way we did it . ''
April 's first Star Wars : The Last Jedi teaser whetted fans ' appetite , but since the full trailer and new poster arrived earlier this month , it 's been a feeding frenzy of speculation . Fan speculation is running rampant over whether or not Luke Skywalker ( Mark Hamill ) has gone over to the dark side ( or perhaps that it 's Daisy Ridley 's Rey who is turning that way ) .
Director Rian Johnson and producer Ram Bergman recently sat down to talk about the movie as part of Ireland Week ‚Äî talks on culture , art and commerce taking place at locations including the Regal Theater at L.A. Live through Oct. 21 . A significant portion of The Last Jedi was shot at Ireland 's UNESCO World Heritage Site Skellig Michael , which fans will remember from the final frames of The Force Awakens , which showed Luke 's emerald-tower hideaway high above a roiling sea .
‚Äú That very last image of The Force Awakens , with Rey holding the lightsaber out to Luke , that was so evocative . In every other case , Star Wars movies jumped forward in leaps of time . I knew I was supposed to do that , but the last image was intriguing . I knew I wanted to know where we were going next , ‚Äù Johnson told the audience about the Dec. 15 release .
A behind-the-scenes video showed John Boyega and Oscar Isaac , as well as Ridley and Hamill , scampering up and down Skellig 's steep hillside and shooting scenes in Oscar-winning production designer Rick Heinrichs ' breathlessly cantilevered Jedi village , which was suspended 700 feet above the surf .
Johnson said the best Star Wars movies tread a fine line between bubblegum and opera , but had little to say about The Last Jedi , noting only that their favorite ship is the A-wing , which the new film will have plenty of .
After the discussion , they sat down for an interview with The Hollywood Reporter to discuss fan speculation about that new poster , how the film will recontextualize other Star Wars movies and walking up 600 steps just to get to work .
The Jedi-village set looks like a monastery . Did you design it with the island 's existing sixth century monastery in mind ?
It 's a direct translation of it . Those domes , that beehive kind of design of the huts , are exactly what 's on Skellig . And we moved the geography of them around a little bit to what we needed . But the design was taken straight from Skellig . We wanted to fit in with what was on the islands .
The domed roofs of the village are reminiscent of the desert home Luke was raised in back on Tatooine .
It 's incredible , the connection with them . There is virtually no design happening on our part . It 's coincidental . It 's funny how things rhyme .
You had no second thoughts when you were scouting Skellig Michael and then took a look at those 600 stairs up the mountainside ?
It had been built up so much before we got there , saying , `` You have to be careful on the steps . Take breaks . This is going to be so hard . '' The first time I climbed the steps , I got to the top , and I thought we were at the halfway point . I guess it had been built up to me so much , it actually was n't as bad as I thought .
Would n't greenscreen have been easier and more economical ?
I 'm sure it would have been more economical , but it was so worth it to do it the way we did it . We got a feel , we got a vibe , we got a grounded kind of look that we never could have gotten on the greenscreen . I guess I should add that I was just trolloping up the stairs without a pack on my back . All of our great Irish crew , who acted as sherpas carting our equipment up the stairs , it was much more difficult for them . I do n't want to be cavalier about the stairs .
What do you think of the speculation surrounding the latest poster , and has Luke gone over to the dark side ?
Having been a Star Wars fan myself for the past 40 years , having spent most of my life on the other side of the curtain , I know the anticipation and the guesswork and theorizing is all part of the fun and game of it . So I love it . I love seeing what people are thinking , seeing what they 're guessing , seeing what they 're anticipating .
Part of it is recontextualizing past movies . How does yours do that ?
Each new film hopefully recontextualizes what came before it . That 's part of the game . Yes , it 's a continuation of not only The Force Awakens , but also of the legacy leading up to it .
And , of course , the third movie will be referencing your movie . Have there been any discussions ?
J.J. Abrams is doing a third movie . I 'm not involved in it . They 'll be writing their own story , but continuing on with what we did .
Star Wars : The Last Jedi opens Dec. 15 .
√ó Researcher accidentally gives themselves Zika
A researcher at the University of Pittsburgh accidentally infected themselves with the Zika virus while working in a lab , the university said .
The woman stuck themselves with a needle May 23 while conducting an experiment with the virus . Nine days later , they began experiencing symptoms consistent with the virus , including a fever . They subsided , and they returned to work Monday . Two days later , the university received confirmation a test was positive for the mosquito-borne illness .
‚Äú On advice of the ACHD ( Allegheny County Health Department ) , the researcher is complying with a request to wear long sleeves and pants and wear insect repellent for three weeks from the date of contact , ‚Äù a university statement said Thursday .
Pennsylvania 's Allegheny County Health Department confirmed the woman no longer has symptoms and said they are doing well . In a statement , it called the case unique because the researcher had not traveled to an area where the virus is circulating and they were not infected through sexual transmission .
Nearly all of the infected individuals in the continental United States were infected while traveling to destinations where the virus is circulating . There are 11 confirmed cases of the virus among individuals who had not traveled to those places but whose sexual partners had .
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said health care workers who handle the virus are encouraged to ‚Äú take precautions to prevent needle sticks or other exposures . ‚Äù
‚Äú We want to remind residents that , despite this rare incident , there is still no current risk of contracting Zika from mosquitoes in Allegheny County , ‚Äù Dr. Karen Hacker , the health department 's director , said in a statement . It was the fourth case of the virus in the Pennsylvania county .
Emergency response teams ready
CDC Director Tom Frieden said Thursday that emergency response teams are ready to be deployed when local transmission of the virus has been confirmed in the continental United States or Hawaii . These are groups of public health experts to help with the response during emergency situations .
Frieden offered the information while reviewing available resources for states during a video conference call with governors and local officials from nine states identified as most at risk for local transmission of the virus , according to a statement from the Department of Health and Human Services . Those states include Alabama , Arizona , California , Florida , Georgia , Hawaii , Louisiana , Mississippi and Texas .
Frieden discussed a federal Zika response plan , created with input from state and local officials , which outlines protocols for the initial response when local transmission occurs .
Also on the call , Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell and Amy Pope , a deputy homeland security adviser , encouraged the states to prepare and prevent local transmission now before the summer mosquito season is fully underway .
Where are the Zika-carrying mosquitoes ?
The mosquitoes spreading the virus are the female Aedes aegypti . On Thursday , CDC researchers and Colorado State University published a new map showing where this mosquito , which is also responsible for spreading other related viruses such as dengue fever and chikungunya , has been found in the United States .
The map combines information from counties about where the Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes have been found for two decades . The Aedes albopictus , known as the tiger mosquito , is found in similar areas and could also spread Zika .
‚Äú Between January 1995 and March 2016 , 183 counties from 26 states and the District of Columbia reported the occurrence of Aedes aegypti , and 1,241 counties from 40 states and the District of Columbia reported the occurrence of Aedes albopictus , ‚Äù said the study , which is published in the Journal of Medical Entomology .
However , the researchers noted that large outbreaks of the virus are unlikely in the continental United States . That 's based on the limited transmission seen from those other viruses , which is attributed to factors such as air conditioning and window screens .
The study said conditions would have to , ‚Äú deteriorate to mimic those seen in previous centuries or if other modes of transmission for these viruses became more widespread. ‚Äù The authors said their work ‚Äú underscores the need for systematic surveillance ‚Äù of these mosquitoes nationwide because not all counties collect this data or collect the data in the same way .

The Mystery Of The Dyaltov Accident
On February 2nd , 1959 Igor Dyatlov lead a team of 8 other cross country skiers through the Ural mountains , when something happened . But over 50 years later , what happened that night is still a mystery .
The group was on a ski trek from Vizhai to Otorten through the Ural mountains . They departed on January 27th and were expected to arrive in Ortorten no later than February 12th . When the group was still not heard from on February 20th , a rescue team was sent out to search for the missing group .
On February 26th the group 's abandoned camp was found on Kholat Syakhl . The tent had a massive slash down one entire side . A path of footprints is followed from the tent almost 1.5 km north-east to the edge of a forest . Searchers found the remains of a fire under a large pine tree , along with the first two corpses . Both were shoeless and only wearing their underwear . Three more corpses were found between the camp and pine tree , all at different distances . The other four bodies were found two months later , on May 4th in a ravine , beside a small stream further into the woods . But this was just the beginning of The Dyatlov Accident ...

The Investigation Into The Dyatlov Accident
After the medical examination was conducted they discovered that the first five bodies found had died of hypothermia . Only one person had a small fracture on the skull , but it was not believed to be the cause of death .
Of the other four bodies found in the ravine , three had fatal injuries . One had major skull damage , and the other two had major chest fractures . The estimated force required to cause this damage was equivalent to a severe car crash .
None of the bodies had external wounds , indicating extreme pressure had caused the fractures . A few of the bodies had high levels of radiation in their clothing . Although some of the victims were wearing each other 's clothes .
It was determined that there were no signs of struggle in the two area 's where the bodies were discovered .
In a weird twist , the medical examiner gave the possibility that some of the victims had been blinded before they died .
The final verdict given after the compeletion of the investigation was that the group had been killed by an `` unknown compelling force '' .

Interesting Points
Some points have been added after the initial investigation into The Dyatlov Pass Accident :
Relatives of the deceased reported that the victims skin had a strange brown or orange tan and their hair had turned grey
In an interview , an investigator said that high radiation levels had been found on Kholat Sakhl , but the source of the radiation was never found
A group of hikers there were camping about 60 km due south of Kholat Syakhl reported that they had seen large orange spheres that night directly over the area of the abandoned camp where the Dyatlov Accident had occurred . These same orange sphere 's were seen multiple times by many different witnesses from February to March 1959
Was this a military experiment gone wrong ? An attack from an unknown alien force ? An ancient tribe attacking trespassers ?
The truth of The Dyatlov Pass Accident may never be discovered .

For those of us who follow the tech industry closely , patents are a touchy subject lately thanks to all the litigation going on over software patents .
This is particularly true in the mobile arena , where companies including Apple and Microsoft have been especially enthusiastic in their use of patents as leverage over their competitors .
Of course , it 's one thing for a company with products to protect to begin asserting patents against others ; it 's quite another , however , for companies to buy and assert patents without producing any goods of their own .
‚Äú Patent troll ‚Äù is the name typically given to firms in this latter category , and -- according to a new study -- they 're depriving technology businesses of more than $ 80 billion per year , to the detriment of small inventors and society as a whole .
Half a Trillion Dollars
‚Äú Non-practicing entities ‚Äù ( NPEs ) is the polite name given to patent trolls by Boston University School of Law researchers James Bessen , Jennifer Ford , and Michael Meurer , whose paper , ‚Äú The Private and Social Costs of Patent Trolls ‚Äù ( PDF ) , will soon be published in the journal Regulation .
Whereas such firms once helped enable technology markets and boost the profits small inventors could earn from their inventions , that 's no longer the case , the authors argue . Rather , today 's NPEs assert patents ‚Äú on an unprecedented scale , ‚Äù they write , involving thousands of defendants every year in hundreds of lawsuits .
The researchers studied the effect of patent lawsuits on defendants ' wealth by examining the stock price of those companies around the time the lawsuits in question were filed . After factoring out market trends and random factors , they found that between 1990 and 2010 , NPE lawsuits are associated with half a trillion dollars in lost wealth to defendants .
'They Decrease Incentives for Innovation '
Over the past four years , in fact , that lost wealth averaged more than $ 80 billion per year -- primarily at the expense of technology companies that invest heavily in R & D .
Such litigation typically focuses on software and related technologies , the authors note ; most often , it targets firms that have already developed technology . Particularly telling is that ‚Äú the loss of incentives to the defendant firms is not matched by an increase in incentives to other inventors , ‚Äù they write .
The bottom line is that patent trolls are simply exploiting weaknesses in the patent system without adding value , the study concludes . In fact , they harm society by doing so : ‚Äú While the lawsuits increase incentives to acquire vague , over-reaching patents , they decrease incentives for real innovation overall , ‚Äù the researchers explain .
'Fuzzy Boundaries '
It 's easy to lay blame at the feet of the patent trolls themselves , of course , but the authors of this study point squarely at the ‚Äú fuzzy boundaries ‚Äù and unclear scope of patents on software and business methods , in particular .
I could n't agree more . We 're all paying a heavy price for this broken patent system . It 's long past time to abolish software patents , once and for all .
P. Walter Tugnut is about to be vindicated . For years now , he 's been marginalized , living on the fringe of society in an RV , working in a robot factory , and spending every spare moment trying to warn the doubtful populace of an impending robot revolt .
Well , the robots are revolting . And the only thing to do is grab a gun and make with the shooting .
This side-scroller ( a shooter , as the title would suggest , but with action RPG elements ) is a well-balanced combination of old-school button-mashing appeal and innovative leveling and character development systems . Rather than the traditional route of picking a character class right from the start and being stuck with it , the equipment selected for purchase largely determines the character 's personality traits , making characters more mutable mid-game than one would normally expect .
Players are also always equipped with two weapons : a primary gun , which is typically an all-purpose affair with unlimited ammo , and a secondary weapon that is usually something a bit more hefty , but which also must be recharged or reloaded . For this option , I myself went with the freeze ray , which was at least as long as I was tall , and bright orange . And it did , indeed , shoot many robots .
The controls are quite straightforward : Buttons control jumping , shooting , weapon swap and melee combat ( though this seemed somewhat ineffective , at least in the levels that I played through , but perhaps it is useful in some scenarios ) . Jumping and hitting Left Trigger will allow players to use a jetpack to hover briefly , and Left Bumper , when held while standing over a fallen comrade will revive them .
Speaking of comrades , Shoot Many Robots was designed with co-op play in mind , according to Senior Designer Josh Glavine , and features both local and online . Local is played , obviously , with two players , but the online mode can take up to four , and is somewhat of a different experience , as certain scenarios actually do involve a bit more verbal communication and coordination between players than one might expect from similar games .
Additionally , there are various difficulty levels , as one might expect , but they are implemented a bit differently than usual . Normally , players would expect either to be able to change difficulty levels mid-stream , or have to play through an entire game in order to unlock the next level , but in Shoot Many Robots , everyone must start out in `` normal '' , with increased difficulty levels unlocked as options as the game progresses .
One of the things I 've noticed so far at Pax Prime 2011 is a heavy trend towards manmade apocalypse scenarios , and it 's easy to lose the individual entries in clouds of zombie/robot/golem/etc . debris . However , Shoot Many Robots bears all the hallmarks of a pretty solid little game . It will be available on PSN and XBL , as well as for PC , though I dare say the game 's charm will be maximized with a console controller clenched firmly in the hands .
Shoot them robots , for they are many .
Akron 's Rolling Acres Mall is the latest Ohio mall to shut its doors after years of trying to stay afloat .
Once home to over 140 retail stores , previously anchored by names such as May Company , Montgomery Ward , and Higbee 's ( all which went through re-branding transitions ) , and , most recently , by Target , Sears , and JC Penny , the Rolling Acres mall officially made its final holiday sales and closed up shop on Dec. 31 , 2013 .
Though the mall has only been vacant for a little over a month , it 's already showing signs of deterioration .
Here are 24 photos of the mall 's interior and exterior , courtesy of Nicholas Eckhart and Justin Higgins , who have photographed dozens of decaying malls all across the country . The photos were taken between 2012 and 2013 as retailers began vacating the space .

Breastfeeding
¬© UNICEF Making room for nursing mothers helps boost breastfeeding rates . Watch this animation about a campaign in China to do just that : Ten Square Metres of Love .
Check out a photo essay for World Breastfeeding Week 2015 which aims to empower women to combine work with breastfeeding and raising their children .
World Breastfeeding Week , celebrated this year from 1-7 August , is an annual event highlighting the critical importance of breastfeeding for children across the globe . Breastfeeding gives children the healthiest start in life and is one of the simplest , smartest and most cost-effective ways we have of ensuring that all children survive and thrive .
The theme of this year 's World Breastfeeding Week is ‚Äò Women and work ‚Äì Let 's make it work ' which emphasizes the need for better support systems and policies to enable working mothers to breastfeed .
There are approximately 830 million women workers in the world . Many of them return to work soon after delivering babies , and they need supportive national polices and legislation ‚Äì such as paid maternity leave and breastfeeding breaks ‚Äì to enable them to continue breastfeeding . There are also millions more women working in the informal , seasonal or part-time economy who face even greater barriers to breastfeeding . They need strong family and community support to manage the demands of work and breastfeeding their babies .
Providing this support is the right thing to do for both babies and mothers : breastfeeding prevents infant death , childhood illness and non-communicable diseases , while supporting brain development and protecting maternal health . It also makes good economic sense . Women who have adequate maternity benefits value their employers , leading to increased productivity , job satisfaction and loyalty .
UNICEF is working to support national governments in making the world a friendlier place for all mothers who wish to breastfeed .
Impact on child survival and global situation
In the last two decades , child mortality has decreased considerably , but close to 7 million children under five years of age still die each year , mainly from preventable causes . Of those , newborn deaths now represent nearly half of all child deaths under five years . Immediate breastfeeding ‚Äì putting the baby to the mother 's breast within an hour after birth ‚Äì would significantly reduce neonatal mortality .
Early and exclusive breastfeeding helps children survive , but it also supports healthy brain development , improves cognitive performance and is associated with better educational achievement at age 5 . Breastfeeding is the foundation of good nutrition and protects children against disease . In this way , breastfeeding allows all children to thrive and develop to their full potential . Yet , less than half of the world 's newborns benefit from early breastfeeding and even fewer are exclusively breastfed for the first six months .
Optimal breastfeeding of infants under two years of age has the greatest potential impact on child survival of all preventive interventions , with the potential to prevent over 800,000 deaths ( 13 per cent of all deaths ) in children under five in the developing world ( Lancet 2013 ) . ‚Äù
Breastfed children have at least six times greater chance of survival in the early months than non-breastfed children . An exclusively breastfed child is 14 times less likely to die in the first six months than a non-breastfed child , and breastfeeding drastically reduces deaths from acute respiratory infection and diarrhoea , two major child killers ( Lancet 2008 ) . The potential impact of optimal breastfeeding practices is especially important in developing country situations with a high burden of disease and low access to clean water and sanitation . But non-breastfed children in industrialized countries are also at greater risk of dying - a recent study of post-neonatal mortality in the United States found a 25 % increase in mortality among non-breastfed infants . In the UK Millennium Cohort Survey , six months of exclusive breastfeeding was associated with a 53 % decrease in hospital admissions for diarrhoea and a 27 % decrease in respiratory tract infections .
While breastfeeding rates are no longer declining at the global level , with many countries experiencing significant increases in the last decade , only 39 per cent of children less than six months of age in the developing world are exclusively breastfed and just 58 per cent of 20-23 month olds benefit from the practice of continued breastfeeding . A growing number of countries are demonstrating that significant and rapid progress is possible , with 25 countries showing increases of 20 percentage points or more .
Breastfeeding is for every creature in this animated short from China .
Recommendations for optimal breastfeeding
The World Health Organization and UNICEF recommendations on breastfeeding are as follows : initiation of breastfeeding within the first hour after the birth ; exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months ; and continued breastfeeding for two years or more , together with safe , nutritionally adequate , age appropriate , responsive complementary feeding starting in the sixth month .
Benefits of breastfeeding
Breastfeeding has an extraordinary range of benefits . It has profound impact on a child 's survival , health , nutrition and development . Breast milk provides all of the nutrients , vitamins and minerals an infant needs for growth for the first six months , and no other liquids or food are needed . In addition , breast milk carries antibodies from the mother that help combat disease . The act of breastfeeding itself stimulates proper growth of the mouth and jaw , and secretion of hormones for digestion and satiety . Breastfeeding creates a special bond between mother and baby and the interaction between the mother and child during breastfeeding has positive repercussions for life , in terms of stimulation , behaviour , speech , sense of wellbeing and security and how the child relates to other people . Breastfeeding also lowers the risk of chronic conditions later in life , such as obesity , high cholesterol , high blood pressure , diabetes , childhood asthma and childhood leukaemias . Studies have shown that breastfed infants do better on intelligence and behaviour tests into adulthood than formula-fed babies .
Virtually every mother can breastfeed , if given appropriate support , advice and encouragement , as well as practical assistance to resolve any problems . Studies have shown that early skin to skin contact between mothers and babies , frequent and unrestricted breastfeeding to ensure continued production of milk and help with positioning and attaching the baby increase the chances of breastfeeding being successful .
Breastfeeding also contributes to maternal health immediately after the delivery because it helps reduce the risk of post-partum haemorrhage . In the short term , breastfeeding delays the return to fertility and in the long term , it reduces type 2 diabetes and breast , uterine and ovarian cancer . Studies have also found an association between early cessation of breastfeeding and post natal depression in mothers .

Risks of mixed feeding
Mixed feeding , or giving other liquids and/or foods together with breast milk to infants under 6 months of age , is widespread in many countries . This practice poses risks to an infant 's health because it can increase the chance of their getting diarrhea and other infectious diseases . Mixed feeding , especially giving water or other liquids , can also cause the supply of breast milk to decrease as the baby sucks less at the breast . Babies do not need liquids other than breastmilk , not even water , in the first 6 months as breastmilk contains all the water a baby needs , even in very hot climates .
Mixed feeding increases the risk of mother to child transmission of HIV . Exclusive breastfeeding for up to six months was associated with a three to four-fold decreased risk of transmission of HIV compared to mixed feeding breastfeeding in several African studies .

Risks of artificial feeding
In many countries , the reinforcement of a `` breastfeeding culture '' and its vigorous defense against incursions of a ‚Äú formula-feeding culture ‚Äù is imperative . Many mothers neither exclusively breastfeed for the first six months of the baby 's life nor continue breastfeeding for the recommended two years or more , and instead replace breast milk with commercial breastmilk substitutes or other milks . Artificial feeding is expensive and carries risks of additional illness and death , particularly where the levels of infectious disease are high and access to safe water is poor . Formula-feeding poses many practical challenges for mothers in developing countries , including ensuring the formula is mixed with clean water , that dilution is correct , that sufficient quantities of formula can continually be acquired and that the feeding utensils , especially if bottles are used , can be adequately cleaned .
Formula is not an acceptable substitute for breastmilk because formula , at its best , only replaces most of the nutritional components of breast milk : it is just a food , whereas breast milk is a complex living nutritional fluid containing anti-bodies , enzymes , long chain fatty acids and hormones , many of which simply can not be included in formula . Furthermore , in the first few months , it is hard for the baby 's gut to absorb anything other than breastmilk . Even one feeding of formula or other foods can cause injuries to the gut , taking weeks for the baby to recover .
The major problems are the societal and commercial pressure to stop breastfeeding , including aggressive marketing and promotion by formula producers . These pressures are too often worsened by inaccurate medical advice from health workers who lack proper skills and training in breastfeeding support . In addition , many women have to return to work soon after delivery , and they face a number of challenges and pressures which often lead them to stop exclusive breastfeeding early . Working mothers need support , including legislative measures , to enable them to continue breastfeeding .
UNICEF action
UNICEF supports countries to implement the priority actions outlined in the Global Strategy for Infant and Young Child Feeding . The focus in countries is on five major areas :
1 . At national level : ensuring that not only is appropriate policies and legislation in place but that these are implemented and enforced . This includes support for :
development and implementation of national infant and young child feeding policies and strategy frameworks ,
development and implementation of programme plans to operationalize the strategy ,
development and enforcement of appropriate legislation ( such as the International Code of Marketing of Breast milk Substitutes and maternity protection legislation ) .
Encouraging and facilitating strategic public and private partnerships with other international and country-level actors for improvement of infant and young child nutrition
2 . Health system level : support is provided to institutionalize interventions in the health system , such as the Ten Steps to Successful Breastfeeding and the Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative ( BFHI ) , curricula , training and support of health workers and health information systems . Resources , jointly produced with the World Health Organization , include the BFHI training course and an Integrated Course on IYCF Counseling .
3 . Community level : support is provided for community-based IYCF counseling , communication and mother support activities involving for example community health workers , lay counselors and mother to mother support groups ( see the page on community IYCF ) .
4 . Communication and advocacy activities on breastfeeding are also a key component of UNICEF support .

A 19th century painting by Polish artist Robert Sliwinski that was stolen by the Nazis during World War II was returned to its home country and presented to the public on Wednesday .
After a tip from Poland 's Ministry of Culture and National Heritage , FBI agents recovered the painting in a town near Philadelphia , FBI spokesperson Carrie Adamowski of the Philadelphia Field Office told NPR .
They said they could n't comment on how the artwork made its way to the United States or when it was recovered . But Adamowski did say the person in possession of the painting did n't know it was Nazi-looted art and was cooperating with investigators . They also said that the U.S. Attorney 's Office does not expect to file charges .
`` We 're just gratified that we were able to return to Poland a piece of cultural heritage , '' Adamowski said .
U.S . Ambassador to Poland Paul Jones joined Polish Culture Minister Piotr Glinski as the painting ‚Äî sometimes referred to as Street With Castle Ruins ‚Äî was unveiled in Warsaw . Three FBI agents from the art crime team who assisted in its recovery , Special Agents Jake Archer and Don Asper and Supervisory Special Agent Tim Carpenter , also attended the presentation .
As The Associated Press reports , the ceremony `` marked one of the latest recoveries of a cultural object by Poland , which saw much of its cultural patrimony destroyed or looted during the country 's wartime occupation by Nazi Germany . ''
Representatives from museums and cultural centers across Poland celebrated the painting 's return , some on social media . ( Click through the links for an English translation . )
Another Polish painting of the same era was recently removed from auction at Sotheby 's in London . The Sword Dance , by Henryk Siemiradzki , had been scheduled for sale Tuesday but was withdrawn following a last-minute request from the Polish government , according to Radio Poland .
Sotheby 's said the decision `` was dictated solely by the good of the painting and not by arguments by Poland , '' the broadcaster writes .

As of Wednesday afternoon , the painting was still visible via search on Sotheby 's website , but the specific listing had been taken down . The auction house valued the painting between 80,000 and 120,000 GBP ( roughly $ 107,000- $ 161,000 ) . According to Sotheby 's website , there are at least four known original versions of the painting in addition to copies made by Siemiradzki 's peers .
Radio Poland adds :
`` A Warsaw prosecutor has launched an inquiry into how the painting was taken out of Poland . The owner of the work , a German citizen , claims it was purchased by their parents around 1960 . A preliminary investigation has revealed there is no documentation to prove that permission had been granted to take the piece out of Poland . ''
Glinski , the Polish culture minister , told the broadcaster that they found insufficient evidence to support these claims . Another version of The Sword Dance previously sold at Sotheby 's for more than $ 2 million .
PORTLAND , Ore. -- Just how clean is the Willamette River ?
According to the City of Portland , it is cleaner than it 's been in decades and clean enough for swimming . The city knows this because it tests the water weekly .
Every Wednesday between the months of May and September , a field technician with the Bureau of Environmental Services collects a water sample from the river . That sample is then tested for E. coli .
So far this summer , the tests have shown bacteria levels well within safe limits .
The safety benchmark is 406 E. coli colonies per 100 milliliters of water .
Last week 's tests showed an average of only 6 E. coli colonies per 100 milliliters in the Portland area .
`` We are here to answer a question people commonly ask and that is , 'Is it really safe and clean to go into the Willamette River either swimming boating or kayaking ? ' and the answer is yes , '' said Diane Dulken , spokesperson for the Bureau of Environmental Services .
But even though the water is cleaner , it is still colder than it normally would be this time of year . Also , the current is still very strong .
Emergency responders advise anyone swimming in the river to do so with a buddy , and at the very least bring a flotation device , if you do n't choose to wear one .
`` The fact of the matter is , when people get in trouble , there 's very little time for us to actually affect a rescue , '' said Lt. Rich Chatman with Portland Fire & Rescue . `` So if the people right there are n't able to perform some kind of rescue or at last throw them something that will allow them to float until we can arrive , they 're not going to make it . ''
The city has been conducting the water quality tests for the last five years . The public can track the test results on the city 's website .

This 1970 Ginetta G15 has been used exclusively as a road car and has only one owner previous to the selling dealer . The original purchase receipt , kit build instructions , and detailed maintenance history are included with the sale , and a number of key detail improvements have been carried out as part of a sympathetic sounding restoration . Impossibly small and pretty , these cars are dwarfed even by an Elan from the same era , and this one looks sharp in light blue with hubcaps . Find it here at Sussex Sports Cars in Sussex , England for 8,950 GBP ( ~ $ 14,608 today ) .
There 's no mention of this car 's original color , but the silvery blue it currently wears suits it well and looks period correct , too . The C-pillar treatment is really interesting and easily the car 's most distinct design element , not including the flip-up tail section , of course . It 's an elegantly simple looking thing and we actually prefer it with steel wheels and chrome hubcaps , though a set of Minilites would n't be a sin . The exposed radiator fan seen peeking out from behind the front valance is a neat touch but its wiring should be tucked away for a cleaner look . Trim , glass , and chrome alllook quite nice , and we ca n't see any evidence of crazing on the fiberglass body panels .
The interior is bare bones but attractive , and details like the quilted inner door lining and lavender seatbelts add a lot of visual interest . Carpet , upholstery , gauges , and trim all look very nice , but there has to be a better floor mat option out there somewhere . The small diameter three spoke steering wheel would be a pleasure to operate but is angled up rather awkwardly in a way familiar to anyone who 's ever driven a Ferrari 308 ( or a Mini ) .
Regrettably the engine is n't shown , but the original , rear-mounted , Hilman Imp sourced 875 CC four has been upgraded to a 975 CC unit which is said to offer 70 HP or so‚Äîplenty for a car roughly the size and weight of four stacked twin size mattresses . During restoration the car received extra reinforcing on the rear subframe which is said to cradle a new transaxle in addition to the larger engine . The lower portion of its tube chassis has been Waxoyl 'd , and the motor has been at least partially rebuilt with a machined head .
One of only 800 or so built , it 's unlikely you 'd ever encounter another going in the opposite direction . We 've seen our fair share of tracked Ginettas before , but it 's refreshing to see one that 's spent its whole life as a road machine . If it runs as good as it looks this one needs nothing but to be driven , but only by those small enough to squeeze themselves inside it .
Ervin Kohn - Facebook
Ervin Kohn , President of the Jewish Community in Oslo , tells The Local that a ban on circumcision , or brit milah , would mean the end of their 720-strong community .
Anne Lindboe , Norway 's children 's ombudsman , is an ambitious woman . It 's interesting that since they took office more than a year ago , she 's written two opinion pieces in the newspapers , both of them on circumcision .
There are a lot of problems concerning children which they have not addressed , but they have addressed this twice .
I think they get a very good reception from the general public in Norway . It 's a strange custom to most Norwegians . They 're not used to it , and the general public is secular , so it 's easy for them to look on it as barbaric . People find it repulsive . They look at these newborns and think 'poor babies ' .
In the public debate , they propose an age limit of 15-16 years , so they 're arguing that they 're not proposing a ban , even though we are obligated to do it on the eighth day of the child 's life , so it is a ban on brit milah .
For the Jewish community this is an existential question .
We have all kinds of Jews . They keep the commandments they want and they disregard the commandments they do n't want : except for the obligation of circumcision .
The obligation of circumcision is almost universal : 99 percent of Jews do it , regardless of their denomination .
If you want to obliterate a Jewish community , you impose a ban on brit milah .
This is not the first time societies have proposed a ban . For that you have to go back to the Romans and the Ancient Greeks .
I 'm not worried about a ban on brit milah now , although we will have legislation on the issue .
The previous government 's proposal was very good and we supported it .
Their proposal was to let healthcare authorities perform circumcision on newborns in our hospitals , because as it is today , our hospitals do not perform any kind of circumcision on babies . They also proposed footing the bill .
Their second proposal was that the Jewish community could continue as it is today , so long as our mohel is authorised , and that we have medical staff present , which we always do .
The present government will propose legislation in April , and I have asked the new health minister for a meeting .
This is a conservative liberal government . They do n't believe in an authoritarian state ruling over people 's personal lives , and they have the backing and the support of the Christian Democratic Party in the parliament .
It would be a great surprise if they did n't follow the last government 's proposals .
Personally , I took the decision of moving to a different country 10 years ago , and have n't really regretted it . There are some things that you miss out on , being an expat . The jokes people make around here were different at first , and I still do n't know most of the childhood memories and other cultural things they refer to . But at the same time , learning English and moving to England made my life into what it is now . I was 20 when I moved and never had a lot of baggage to carry around with me , but now that I do have work and a partner to worry about where does that leave time for living abroad ?
Be more than `` 8 days on a beach ''
I want adults to be daring and look beyond the obvious short vacations . Countries always become a lot more interesting when you stray from the tourist trail , but this can be scary . I spent five years travelling the world from China to Estonia as a recruitment officer , always aiming to chat to people and convince them to spend time abroad . As a foreigner , I 've often met with people in their own houses or offices and worried that I would n't understand a word they say or that they 'd just reject my interest . But the risk pays off . Sure , you could spend a week in a hotel in Barcelona and practice your Spanish at a market stall . But we are all perfectly equipped to start thinking of our destination as more than a resort . It 's a complete world with political debates , economic strengths and people who go to work every day .
You wo n't lose your job
Professional exchanges and development opportunities beyond borders are not often advertised enough , but they are real career assets , to be used and sought out . Make sure you choose something relevant , and you 'll benefit from it years later .
‚Äú I 'm proud of myself for being brave enough to do it and not listening to the nagging voice of self doubt which tried to hold me back . ‚Äù
‚Äî Sharon
Sharon McGuinness , a Provision Planning Officer for Lancashire Council , experienced just three weeks out of their comfort zone in Lancashire when they participated in a professional exchange with Vigo , Spain in 2012 . You can read their full diary on the EU LAG website . They applied after reading about the exchange opportunities in a professional newsletter . Before going out there , Sharon says they found the idea `` A little daunting but only because of my concerns at relative lack of Spanish language skills . At 3 weeks it was only a week longer than an average fortnight 's holiday though so I figured the potential adventure outweighed the risk of it being really difficult or boring ! '' Having completed the exchange , they say that it taught them not better Spanish , but also self-reliance and confidence .
Top 5 International Work Opportunities
I have been researching many different schemes for spending time working or developing yourself abroad for this article and admittedly it was difficult for me to find many general schemes for anyone . On the other hand , it is so encouraging to find out just how much encouragement and financial support is available for most professionals in their own field .
Good places to look for information are with big international organisations or associations ( like the European Union or United Nations ) , cultural institutes ( Goethe Institut or Confucius Institute for example ) and with professional associations in your own field . But for now , sit back and let these cool ideas inspire you .
EU Funding
The EU funds an awful lot of stuff and also collaborates with countries such as the USA , China , Korea and Japan . Their funding grants available for language-related activities alone are mind-blowing . Students , teachers , professionals , anyone in the labour market can find the right programme and funding to spend a bit of time abroad . You do n't have to be in a member state , the EU considers many other countries like Iceland , Switzerland , Croatia and Russia . And you can also have any nationality . The opportunities are endless , so I will give you my favourites :
For entrepreneurs : Erasmus for Entrepreneurs
Starting your own business is massively exciting and also really hard , so how cool would it be to learn from a successful business leader , without the fixed ideas that exist in your own country ? If you want to soak up as much learning as possible and make international contacts at the same time , this one is perfect . No age restriction , but you must have set up your own company in the last 3 years .
For James Bond wannabes : Pericles - fight against fraud
The web information relating to this scheme really shows you why EU funding is so hard to find : the legal language and official documents are a bit confusing , but in essence this programme has the very cool job of making the international fight against fake money possible . Easiest way around the website is to look up the national agency in your own country and get in touch with them to find out what 's on offer . It 's mostly for those working in law enforcement , banks and areas like that .
For Jobseekers : Camps & TEFL
There are lots of language focused camps looking for staff members every summer . This ranges from the classic Camp America in the USA to English Teaching in Italy , there 's so much to do everywhere in the world for anyone wanting to get involved in a camp . You may not find that this is the most immersive cultural and linguistic experience , but if you 're hesitant this could be the first step to an international career .
And how could I write an article about international work without mentioning the TEFL ? TEFL is an internationally recognised English teaching qualification that has allowed millions to use their knowledge of one language to travel the world . You 'll need a good understanding of how language works . There are very many TEFL and CELTA qualification programmes out there and you can get a basic certificate in as little as one ( intense ) weekend , including the very well established i-to-i TEFL ( they offer paid internships too ! ) .

The Shape of Antigun Astroturf 20150508.pdf
With It 's straight-faced documentary presentation and found-footage aesthetic , it may take a minute or two before you realize that Till Nowak 's The Centrifuge Brain Project is hell-bent on taking you for a ride‚Äîliterally . What seems like a conventional profile of a high-tech research institute quickly transitions into a joyous visual spectacle‚Äîan Escher-inspired , mad-scientist fueled jaunt through the world of amusement park insanity . Yet , despite all its fun‚Äîits playful visual joy‚Äîthe film 's presentation is decidedly stoic . As is apparent with the film 's website , Nowak and their team are eager to maintain an academic facade .
Impressive special effects videos are practically commonplace nowadays‚Äîthe sort of stuff that you browse on your vimeo feed during your lunch break . The Centrifuge Brain Project takes the next logical step , combining computer generated eyecandy within an established world . The result is something that does n't feel just like a tech . demo , but rather a unique glimpse into a zany unreality . It helps that the film treats its ridiculous concepts with such a self-serious air‚Äînever once letting the viewer see that its tongue is so firmly planted in its own cheek . Yes , we we know that we 're seeing is impossible , but the effects are so good , the ‚Äú found footage ‚Äù so realistic , that your brain wants to argue otherwise , attempting to completely disregard your knowledge of the physical world in the process . It 's like a Valve game come to life‚Äîa playground where imagination , physics , and world building come together to create an innovative sandbox where anything is possible .
Kudos to writer'/director Till Nowak , who has crafted a project that perfectly meshes with their unique skill set as a digital artist . As a filmmaker , this is clearly intended to be their calling card . And , while you could certainly argue that The Centrifuge Brain Project is a bit on the lighter side ( the effects are clearly the focal point ) , the film still manages to win you over in its brief six minute runtime . Frankly , it 's just plain hard not to get swooped up by the whimsy . With each new contraption the film presents , you marvel at the spectacle , waiting with wide-eyes just to see what playful madness The Centrifuge Brain Project will conjure up next .
Under current law , male citizens age 18 to 25 are required to register with the Selective Service , so that they may be called up in the event of a military draft . Women are not required to register , a position long upheld -- including in the 1981 Supreme Court decision Rostker v. Goldberg -- on the basis that women were not allowed to serve in combat positions .
But that may change now that all combat jobs have been open to women since December . A new bill would require women to register for the draft as well .
H.R . 4478 , the Draft America 's Daughters Act , was introduced earlier this month by Rep. Duncan Hunter ( R-CA50 ) , a Marine Corps veteran of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars . The bill was introduced two days after Marine Corps commandant Gen. Robert Neller and Army Chief of Staff Gen. Mark Milley said they believe women should be required to enter the draft .
‚Äú It 's wrong and irresponsible to make wholesale changes to the way America fights its wars without the American people having a say on whether their daughters and sisters will be on the front lines of combat , ‚Äù Hunter said . ‚Äú If this Administration wants to send 18-20 year old women into combat , to serve and fight on the front lines , then the American people deserve to have this discussion through their elected representatives . ‚Äù
The bill has been referred to the House Armed Services Committee .
Hunter warned that they could potentially vote against their own legislation , if it was folded into the annual defense appropriations bill rather than voted on as standalone legislation .
The issue has divided the leading presidential candidates . Marco Rubio supports it , Ted Cruz opposes it , Hillary Clinton said she 's not sure , and Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders have yet to weigh in on the issue . ( Making this perhaps the only issue Trump has yet to weigh in on . )
Hillary Clinton , who would become the first female president if elected , said she 'd ‚Äú have to think about it ‚Äù when asked about the issue earlier this month , though they supported women registering when asked in 2007 . Rubio said , ‚Äú I have no problem whatsoever with people of either gender serving in combat so long as the minimum requirements necessary to do the job are not compromised . Now that that is the case , I do believe Selective Service should be opened up for both men and women . '' Cruz has charged that the policy 's proponents are `` so addled by political correctness that they think we should put our little girls on the front line . That 's crazy . ''
Rep. Mike Coffman ( R-CO6 ) has a different idea for achieving equality between the genders on this issue . Their bill H.R . 4523 , rather than having both men and women register , would have neither register -- by abolishing the Selective Service Act altogether .
A poll from Rasmussen Reports found that women oppose being required to register for the draft , with 52 percent opposed to only 38 percent in favor . Men hold the opposite view , favoring the move by 61 percent .
Api.ai , a developer of AI and natural language tech that enables developers to add Siri-like conversational interfaces to their apps , has raised $ 3 million in additional funding . The round is being led by SAIC Capital , the U.S.-based venture capital arm of China 's largest automaker , SAIC Motor .
That 's noteworthy given that SAIC Capital is another backer with ties to the automotive industry , where voice driven interfaces make a lot of sense . Previous investors Intel Capital , and Alpine Technology Fund also participated , along with Motorola Solutions Venture Capital .
However , the biggest news is perhaps that the additional investment is allowing api.ai to drop the fees for developers using its API , as the company switches to a business model based on large enterprise consulting and support , customisation and on-premise or private cloud installation and licensing .
Naturally , the startup will also continue investing in the development of api.ai 's ‚Äú deep learning methods for speech recognition , intent classification and dialog management , ‚Äù which points to one of the main drivers behind moving to a largely free-to-use model .
In a call , api.ai co-founder and CEO Ilya Gelfenbeyn told me that since the startup 's AI and language engine uses machine learning it essentially becomes smarter the more data and use cases are fed into it .
And , given that making usage free will likely significantly increase developer uptake , the product api.ai sells to enterprise customers , such as those in the automotive or Internet of Things ( IoT ) and consumer electronics space will become greater in value as a result .
Gelfenbeyn says they now have more than 8,500 developers using api.ai to add conversational interfaces to their apps . That 's up from 5,000 or so since we covered the startup in May with regards to its renewed emphasis on making its API easier to use , not least for developers operating in the IoT space .
The company 's own consumer app , Speaktoit , a voice and AI-driven assistant for Android that is similar to Apple 's Siri , also brings in revenue , hence the total api.ai has raised ( and presumably its run-rate ) has been kept pretty lean .
Api.ai has also put together an interesting board of advisors , however superficial these things can be .
It boasts Stephen Wolfram , CEO and Founder of Wolfram Alpha , the ‚Äò knowledge engine ' that in part powers Apple 's Siri and its ability to answer questions ; VP & Project Leader of Project Loon at Google , Mike Cassidy ; and Dariusz Paczuski , Head of Growth at Yahoo who also previously oversaw product and marketing efforts for Microsoft 's voice platform , TellMe .
Texas Rangers starting pitcher Martin Perez ( 33 ) throws in the third inning against the Toronto Blue Jays at Globe Life Park in Arlington , Thursday , June 22 , 2017 . ( Tom Fox/The Dallas Morning News )
The Rangers , however , will get Cole Hamels back after a seven-week absence . Hamels will pitch Monday in Cleveland , the team confirmed . Hamels has been out since May 3 due to a strained oblique muscle .
On Saturday , the club placed left-hander Martin Perez on the 10-day DL , retroactive to Friday , with a small fracture at the tip of the thumb on their right ( non-pitching ) hand . Perez tore the nail off the thumb after catching it in a door in their hotel room . Perez , who was sporting a padded thumb splint Friday , suffered the injury Thursday night after the team arrived in New York . Perez pitched Thursday .
In the meantime , the Rangers recalled INF-OF Drew Robinson from Triple-A Round Rock to replace Perez .
Perez did not initially intend to go on the DL .
`` My bullpen is [ Saturday ] and I 'm going to throw it , '' they said Friday . `` And I 'm not going to miss a start . As long as I can perform my job and protect it , I am going to pitch . Accidents , man , they happen . ''
Perez indicated that they were in their hotel room with their hand resting against the door jam when somebody opened the door , squeezing their thumb . They immediately called athletic trainer Kevin Harmon , who took them to a hospital where the nail was reattached and X-rays showed a small fracture .
Hamels , on the DL since May 3 with a strained oblique , threw a typical between-starts bullpen session Friday , two days after their 5 2/3-inning rehab start at Double-A Frisco . Andrew Cashner , who has a more minor oblique strain , is hoping to throw a bullpen session this weekend . If they do , manager Jeff Banister and pitching coach Doug Brocail indicated they could return without a rehab start or facing hitters in a simulated game . They have only missed one start to this point .
Peter Jackson likes to make cameos in their films ( Picture : AP Photo/Warner Bros )
Peter Jackson loves a good cameo and one resourceful fan has made GIFs of all of their cameos in the Lord Of The Rings and Hobbit films .
The director has made blink-and-you-might-miss-it guest appearances in every film they direct .
In The Fellowship of the Ring , they star as a carrot-chomping villager in Bree while in The Two Towers Jackson plays a defender of Helm 's Deep .
In Return of the King , he 's a Corsair shot by Legolas while in The Hobbit : An Unexpected Journey they take the role of a dwarf fleeing from Erebor after Smaug has attacked
The carrot-munching villager returns in The Hobbit : Desolation of Smaug .
They recently told Empire about their cameo in the latest Hobbit film : ‚Äò I did n't have a great deal of choice .
‚Äò There were n't any human characters in this film and there were n't any hobbit roles I could play‚Ä¶ and I 'm not an elf . '

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Richard Galpin reports from the US embassy where migrants have gathered
Thousands of African migrants have marched in the city of Tel Aviv to protest against their treatment by the Israeli government .
The protesters , mostly Eritreans and Sudanese , are angry about a law that allows illegal immigrants to be detained for a year without trial .
They demanded the right to work legally and for their asylum bids to be processed .
An Israeli police spokesperson said the march was peaceful .
`` We are all refugees '' and `` Yes to freedom , no to prison ! '' they chanted .
'Clear cry '
The BBC 's Richard Galpin in Tel Aviv says the protest was prompted by the new law on detention , which had dashed hopes that a recent crackdown would be halted .
The migrants , some of whom have been in Israel for years and have taken low-paid jobs , say they are all refugees who have fled persecution and conflict back home in Eritrea and Sudan .
Image copyright AP Image caption Police said the marchers were peaceful
Image copyright Getty Images Image caption A new detention law is one of the major grievances
They say their only choice will be either to spend time in prison in Israel or agree to return home .
The dangers in their home countries mean they can not be forcibly returned .
The migrants said they would hold further demonstrations outside UN offices and foreign embassies in Tel Aviv on Monday .
An Israeli official said the authorities would continue to deal with people who , as they put it , had infiltrated Israel , adding that more than 2,600 had agreed to leave voluntarily last year .
Ultra-Orthodox MP Eli Yishai said the migrants had been encouraged by `` anti-Zionist human rights organisations '' .
They told the Maariv daily the protest was `` a sharp and clear cry for the state of Israel and judicial and law enforcement authorities to apply all the means at their disposal to return the infiltrators to their countries '' .
Down they went . The Miami Heat suffered their first loss on Tuesday , at the hands of the Houston Rockets . The Rockets fell to Golden State on Saturday , the same night that the Memphis Grizzlies picked up loss No . 1 in Milwaukee . And the next night , the Warriors fell from the top of the standings with a defeat in Phoenix .
So nobody 's going 82-0 this season . But the Dubs are still undefeated with Klay Thompson . The Rockets are still undefeated with Dwight Howard . The Grizzlies are still undefeated with Vince Carter . The Raptors are still undefeated with Amir Johnson . And heck , the Sixers are still undefeated with Michael Carter-Williams .
There 's been a lot to sort out over the first two weeks of the season . The Warriors are still at No . 1 , thanks to quality wins over the Blazers , Clippers , Rockets ( even though they were short-handed ) and Kings . Yes , a victory in Sacramento can now be considered a quality win .
We 're still a few weeks away from the time when we can really evaluate things . The Clippers have yet to leave California , the Lakers have yet to face a team that had a losing record last season , the Cavs have n't played a home game that was n't preceeded by a concert starring Kendrick Lamar , and the Nets and Nuggets have yet to play a back-to-back .
That does n't mean that certain teams have n't been surprising or disappointing , or that there has n't been plenty to learn from the first 97 games of the season .

Will Terra Nova get a second season ? Will House conclude this season ? Will Fox shake up The X Factor team ?
Fox 's entertainment chief Kevin Reilly faced the critics at the network 's Pasadena press tour event on Sunday . Here 's what we 're hearing and what they said :
‚Äî On Terra Nova , the behind-the-scenes sense has been a second season is likely . ‚Äú It was an exciting bet to take , ‚Äù Reilly said . ‚Äú And it 's proven it was worthwhile . It 's the second highest rated [ first-year student ] drama . We made money on it . The audience enjoyed it , they had amble opportunity to reject it and they did n't . There 's a show there to bring back , there 's an audience to access . There were a lot of chefs in the kitchen . The show was hunting for itself creatively through the season . Creatively it was hunting . I loved some of the episodes. ‚Äù ( Our six ways to improve Terra Nova here ) .
‚Äî On House , sources suggest this is likely the veteran hit medical drama 's final season . But Reilly assures even if that 's the case , creator David Shore will have time to write a great finale ( unlike , say , Fringe ‚Äî more on that here ) . ‚Äú It 's hard to imagine the network without House , ‚Äù they said . ‚Äú It 's not going to be like the pink slip goes out and that 's the end of House . We have n't had the big meeting about what we want to do . It 's no secret last year we said last year it was going to be a close call and it 's probably its last year . This is not going to be an unceremonious finish , I can tell you that. ‚Äù Now even if Fox does axe the show , there 's also a chance another network , like NBC ( whose studio produces the series ) could pick it up . But even if that happens‚Ä¶ ‚Äú it will absolutely have a satisfying conclusion on Fox . There 's no way David Shore is n't going to let fans feel it was n't properly capped off . ‚Äù
In both the case of House and Terra Nova , one likely reason Fox is hesitating about making a judgement call is because the network has three new dramas about to debut ‚Äî Alcatraz , The Finder and Touch . With a limited number of open spots to fill ( Fox does n't program 10 p.m. ) , executives have to be careful how many commitments are made each season . Fox likely wants to get some sense of whether at least one of new shows is likely to get a renewal before deciding on the other two .
‚Äî On X Factor , there have been rumors Fox might dump a couple team members for season two ( specifically , host Steve Jones and judge Nicole Scherzinger ) . Reilly confirmed there will be changes , but did n't say what would be changed . ‚Äú There will be some changes ‚Ä¶ as we know [ hosting ] is a much harder job than meets the eye . I think everybody has come to see the value of Ryan Seacrest . Whether Steve is the guy or not , it comes under the heading of growth in general . ‚Äù
Speaking of , Seacrest 's American Idol deal is up , but Reilly sounded pretty bullish about the host signing a new contract . ‚Äú It 's very hard to imagine the show without Ryan , ‚Äù they said . ‚Äú It 's a tough negotiation and one that will come to conclusion pretty quickly . ‚Äù
Fox also announced plans to launch a late-night animation block on Saturday evenings that will run 11 p.m. to 12:30 a.m . The network created a new division to develop ‚Äú alternative animated ‚Äù programming for the block that will be headed by former Adult Swim programming chief Nick Weidenfeld .

Recently I 've started to work in an evironment where there are tons of CGI script without any mention of use strict ; or use warnings . At this point I do n't yet have the political power to set up a PSGI based server , but as I hope one day I 'll be I wanted to write my new scripts using PSGI . The problem was , how could I run my PSGI script as CGI ?
Luckily Tatsuhiko Miyagawa , the author of Plack and PSGI has thought about similar needs and included the Plack : :Handler : :CGI module in th main Plack distribution .
Hello World !
examples/plack-cgi-hello-world.pl
# ! /usr/bin/env plackup use strict ; use warnings ; sub { return [ '200 ' , [ 'Content-Type ' = > 'text/html ' ] , [ 'Hello World ! ' ] , ] ; } ;
You probably already know from the Getting started with PSGI article that in the PSGI standard we are expected to create a subroutine and have it as the last expression in our main Perl file . That subroutine will be called on every request from the web client and it is expected to return an array reference with 3 values .
The first is the HTTP Status code which is 200 in case of success . The second is a list of key-value pairs that will become the response header . The third is the actual content of the page .
So that 's what we have in our example . So far this was exactly the same as with any other PSGI code .
The difference is in the Hash-bang line . It points to plackup :
# ! /usr/bin/env plackup
We can run this by typing in
perl plack-cgi-hello-world.pl
and it will launch a small web server on port 2000 .
Alternatively , if we would like to run it as a CGI script , we can convert it to be executable chmod +x plack-cgi-hello-world.pl on Unix/Linux systems , and configure our web server ( most likely Apache ) to serve this script as a CGI script .
That 's it . Now you have the skeleton of a PSGI based application , but running as a plain CGI script .
Using with Plack on other port
When I tried the above using perl plack-cgi-hello-world.pl I got an error :
failed to listen to port 5000 : Address already in use at ... /HTTP/Server/PSGI.pm line 94 .
This means I already have another application , probably another PSGI-based application running on that port .
The way to change this sctipt to run on a different port is by adding -- port to the hashbang line .
examples/plack-cgi-hello-world-port-2000.pl
# ! /usr/bin/env plackup -- port 2000 use strict ; use warnings ; sub { return [ '200 ' , [ 'Content-Type ' = > 'text/html ' ] , [ 'Hello World ! ' ] , ] ; } ;
That is not enough though . If we run this as perl plack-cgi-hello-world-port-2000.pl it will still try to open port 5000 . We also need to add the eXecutable bit : chmod +x plack-cgi-hello-world-port-2000.pl and run it as
./plack-cgi-hello-world-port-2000.pl
In an HBO tv series ‚Äú Silicon Valley ‚Äù , a show focused around Richard Hendriks and their friends , their brilliant compression algorithm and their fight against the biggest technology corporations like Hooli , there is one interesting scene about driverless cars .
‚Äç
‚Äç
It begins almost ordinary : one of the main characters is supposed to be taken to their home by an autonomous vehicle . But unfortunately something goes wrong , the car changes its designated course and the character ends trapped in a container on an open sea for 4 days .
Even though it is just a comedy show , that scene shows clearly how some people perceive driverless cars and explains why they are so afraid of them . But honestly , there is nothing to be worried about ! We present you a list of 7 things that you did n't know about autonomous vehicles but you definitely should , as they may soon become part of our daily routine .
1 . Not only Google or Tesla are currently working on autonomous cars ‚Äì more than 50 companies are interested in this matter
‚Äç
There are MANY more companies , as the automated driving has become a very hot topic recently . Creating a truly autonomous car is very challenging and complex because there is an additional , yet the most important aspect that you need to consider ‚Äì ensuring your car passengers safety . Take a look at the graphic showing companies involved in autonomous cars manufacturing :
From the technology giants like Google and Panasonic , through automotive industry companies like BMW and Delphi , ending at mostly graphic cards and processors producers , like Intel and Nvidia ‚Äì all those companies invest their money , believing that automated driving will become a huge success . And I guess so many successful companies ca n't be so horribly wrong , right ?
2 . An autonomous car has already ridden across the America , covering 3,400 miles in 9 days
Delphi , one of the driverless cars industry leaders , sent one of their autonomous cars for a very long journey in 2015 ‚Äì from San Francisco to New York . The trip was accomplished with ‚Äú 99 percent of the drive in fully automated mode , ‚Äù Delphi says , using an Audi Q5 SUV modified with all types of cameras , radars , and laser scanners . The 1 % when a human had to intervene was when a car did n't want to move to the left lane to give space to an emergency vehicle on the shoulder ( which is punished by law ) and while driving through a construction zone , where driver decided that it 's best to take over the control . Nevertheless driving a long distance like that not in a semi , but in a fully automated mode sounds very impressive !
Take a look at the video about this experiment :
‚Äç
‚Äç
3 . There was only one fatal accident in the history of autonomous cars , and it was n't the car 's fault
‚Äç
In 2016 Joshua Brown , a 40-year-old man from Ohio , conducted an autonomous driving test on a Tesla Model S semi-autonomous vehicle . Unfortunately , they hit the side of a tractor-trailer , turning across their path on a divided highway in central Florida . They became the first person ever who died in a driverless car accident , which raised many concerns about automated cars safety among the society .
The Police were investigating the accident very closely to discover who was responsible for this tragedy : the driver or the vehicle ? As it turned out , the car worked exactly as it 's supposed to and unfortunately , it was the driver who did n't respond correctly . The car system warned the driver 7 seconds before the crash that they have to respond to avoid the collision . ‚Äú This should have given the driver enough time to take ‚Äò some action ' , ‚Äù said Bryan Thomas , Communications Director for NHTSA , though it 's not known ‚Äú whether that was enough time to avoid or mitigate the crash . ‚Äù
The accident is n't proving that automated driving is wrong ‚Äì more that it is not perfect yet . And it does n't devastate Tesla , as the latest numbers show that among Tesla cars on the road , those carrying its Autosteer technology , which can keep the car within clear lane markings , crashed 40 percent less frequently than those without it . Let 's agree ‚Äì that ' s a lot !
Tesla Model S

4 . Apple is ( probably ) working on automated car as well
‚Äç
Rumors about Apple focusing on automated cars began in February 2015 . Since then , the company has been very mysterious about it and did n't wan na to say anything to confirm or disclaim those gossips . Finally , an Apple iCar photo has leaked and the company had to start answering everyone 's questions .
The Apple iCar project is codenamed ‚Äò Titan ' , according to The Wall Street Journal , which originally stated there were ‚Äú several hundred ‚Äù Apple employees working on the project . While reports originally claimed that Apple was working on a self-driving car , more recent reports suggest that Apple may have changed directions on the project and is now working on an autonomous driving platform . Whatever the end product will be , Apple is developing something car-related , whether it 's an autonomous driving system , an Apple Car or simply an in-car entertainment system ‚Äì although the company will never admit what . Yet .
‚Äç
5 . Elon Musk said , that people skeptical of autonomous cars are essentially ‚Äú Killing People ‚Äù
Elon Musk , Tesla owner , has recently shared with their very harsh opinion about the press and the people spreading a negative image about driverless cars among society .
They openly accused them , on standing on a way of safer and less accidental roads . And it 's hard not to agree with Musk when they say , that the main cause of the most of the road accidents is‚Ä¶ the driver .
Truth be told , as drivers we sometimes get distracted . We talk through the phone , settle our kids down or sing with the co-passengers ‚Äì all those little things can , unfortunately , lead to a fatal accident . 2015 saw the highest number of roadway deaths and injuries in 50 years , with 38,300 fatalities and 4.4 million injuries .
Musk reminded , that after the fatal Tesla car accident we mentioned before , automated cars has been completely destroyed by the press and the community . Which was pretty ironic , as this was the first fatality in 130 million autopilot-driven miles in the U.S. , while there 's a fatality caused by a human driver every 94 million miles . But people do n't care about facts and remain prejudiced , which leads us to another point .
‚Äç
6 . Most of the people do n't understand what an automated car exactly means
‚Äç
It may seem surprising but the studies show clearly , that the society is not ready yet for driverless cars .
Survey on self-driving cars acceptance by Sustainable Worldwide Transportation
‚Äç
As you can see from the table , only 15,5 % of interviewees are interested in having a completely self-driving vehicle . Only slightly more than a half is interested in having any level of automation in their cars at all . It generally confirms , that people are afraid of losing control over their cars and passing it to the computers . They imagine scenes from movies , where a car takes complete control , and you end up trapped ‚Äì just like in a Silicon Valley scene . But who knows ‚Äì years before , people were afraid of a car itself and now driving one is nothing unusual . So it 's still possible , that people 's opinion may change completely through next years , as automated vehicles become more and more common .
7 . Ty Burrell , ‚Äú Modern Family ‚Äù star recently took a ride in a driverless car
Burrell said , that after seeing those futuristic self-driving cars , they really wanted to try one out . Although they admitted that they are terrified of robots . Delphi took a challenge to show Ty that there is really nothing to be scared about .
In a National Geographic document called Years of Living Dangerously , the Modern Family star faces their fear of bots while test-riding a driverless car . Ty is not alone in the car ‚Äì their companion is Matt , an engineer , who stays in the car for the safety reasons , but they are not allowed to talk at all .
Check the document sneak ‚Äì peak below :
What exactly is an autonomous car ?
An autonomous car is a vehicle that can guide itself without human conduction .
This kind of vehicle has become a concrete reality and may pave the way for future systems where computers take over the art of driving . An autonomous car is also known as a driverless car , robot car , self-driving car or autonomous vehicle . It is perceived as an ultimate version of a smart car ‚Äì an automobile with advanced electronics .
Autonomous cars use various kinds of technologies . They can be built with GPS sensing knowledge to help with navigation . They may use sensors and other equipment to avoid collisions . They also have the ability to use a range of technology known as augmented reality , where a vehicle displays information to drivers in new and innovative ways .

Is there no moral distinction between killing a newborn baby and aborting a fetus ? And should an academic paper that seemingly advocated the killing of newborns have ever been published ? Those are the questions at the heart of a controversy that has erupted after the publication of a paper entitled ‚Äò After-birth abortion : Why should the baby live ? ' in the Journal of Medical Ethics . Two Australian academics , Alberto Giubilini and Francesca Minerva , argued that the moral status of a newborn baby was identical to that of a fetus . Given that most people view abortion as morally acceptable so , they argued , there is no reason not to see infanticide as morally acceptable too , even in ‚Äò cases where the newborn has the potential to have an ( at least ) acceptable life , but the well-being of the family is at risk ' . Indeed , Giubilini and Minerva reject the term ‚Äò infanticide ' , preferring to talk of ‚Äò after-birth abortion ' .
The paper , which would normally have been read only by a handful of moral philosophers , was picked by newspapers and websites and caused outrage worldwide . ‚Äò Slaughter newborn kids , say academics ' , read the headline in one British tabloid . Australian commentators , American chat show hosts and Catholic bishops weighed in , many claiming that infanticide was the logical consequence of the legalization of abortion . The two authors have apparently received death threats .
There is , in fact , little new in Giubilini and Minerva 's argument . Philosophers such as Peter Singer have long championed similar kinds of claims . Humans , Singer suggests , have no intrinsic claim to life . The interests of an individual , including their right to life , depend upon their cognitive abilities . ‚Äò The fact that a being is a human being , in the sense of a member of the species Homo sapiens , is not relevant to the wrongness of killing it ; it is , rather , characteristics like rationality , autonomy , and self-consciousness that make a difference . Infants lack these characteristics . Killing them , therefore , can not be equated with killing normal human beings , or any other self-conscious beings . '
Since a newborn , unlike an adult , is incapable ‚Äò of anticipating the future , of having wants and desires for the future ' , Singer has written , so they do not suffer by being deprived of a life they could never have imagined anyway . ‚Äò Killing a newborn baby is ' , in their view , ‚Äò never equivalent to killing a person , that is , a being who wants to go on living ' . Animals , too , who possess greater cognitive abilities than young children have , Singer insists , a greater claim to life than they do . ‚Äò We should not give less consideration to the interests of animals ' , they argue , ‚Äò than we give to the similar interests of human beings . '
Many believers , and pro-life activists , horrified by such arguments , see support for both abortion and infanticide as the inevitable consequence of disbelief in God . In fact many , probably most atheists , would reject the argument for infanticide .
The problem with the claims of Giubilini , Minerva and Singer derives not from their atheism but from their utilitarianism ‚Äì a philosophical outlook that denies that anything has intrinsic moral worth and views morality in terms of maximising overall ‚Äò happiness ' , where such happiness is measured in terms such as that of increasing pleasure , decreasing pain or ensuring satisfaction of individuals ' preferences . It is a theory that is often logical in some abstract way , but is rarely rational within the framework of actually lived human lives .
Humans are moral beings because we live within a web of reciprocal rights and obligations created by our capacity for rational dialogue . We can distinguish between right and wrong , accept responsibility and apportion blame in a way that no other animal can . This is the non-religious case for human moral specialness .
It is true that newborns , and indeed older children , are incapable of acting as moral agents , or of being held morally accountable for their actions . But children normally grow up to be full members of the moral community . This is important because our humanity derives not from our individual selves , but from our membership of the human collective . Humanity is not invested in a single person , but is a collective label , describing our existence as social beings . We exist only in relation to others , and it is only in relation to others that we make sense of every individual 's humanity . The notion of humanity would become meaningless if we did not extend it to a newborn , just as it would be meaningless if we did not extend it to the severely physically and intellectually disabled , too .
Does not the argument that newborns are part of the moral community of humans , and hence require protection , apply equally to fetuses ? Or , to ask the question from the opposite perspective , if we accept that it is permissible to kill a fetus why not , as Giubilini , Minerva and Singer suggest , a newborn too ? The irony of this debate is that both Giubilini , Minerva and Singer , and their religious pro-life critics , deny that there exists a moral boundary between the fetus and the newborn , though the two groups reach opposite conclusions from this denial . Both insist that newborns should be treated like fetuses . For Giubilini , Minerva and Singer this means the acceptability of infanticide ( or ‚Äò after birth abortion ' ) , for pro-lifers it reveals abortion to be as immoral as infanticide .
I disagree with both sides . Abortion is right , and infanticide is wrong , because there is a moral boundary between the fetus and the newborn .
A cell created by a fusion of egg and sperm is ( if we ignore the possibility of cloning ) a necessary condition of being a human being . It is not a sufficient condition . A human being is created in the long journey from being a single invisible cell to becoming a self-conscious moral agent . That change does not happen at any one instant , but slowly and over time , so that , almost imperceptibly , a qualitatively different being is created . But while this is a process , and there is no point at which a ‚Äò non-human ' becomes a ‚Äò human ' , or a ‚Äò non-person ' becomes a ‚Äò person ' , there are moral boundaries that mark qualitative shifts . Birth is one of those boundaries .
A fetus is a physical part of woman 's body . That is why we talk of ‚Äò a woman 's right to choose ' . Abortion is not about the killing of another human being but about a woman exercising their right to control their own body . The moral status of a fetus that is wanted , and that the woman sees as an unborn child , is different from the moral status of an unwanted fetus that they wish to abort . Most societies recognize this in the moral and legal distinctions they draw between the abortion of an unwanted fetus and the killing of a wanted one .
Birth transforms that relationship . An entirely physical attachment becomes primarily , and increasingly , social . A fetus is part of the physical body of a woman . A newborn is part of the moral community of humans . Its moral status no longer depends upon the subjective desires of the woman but derives from its membership of the moral community . In that change lies the moral difference between a fetus and a newborn , and between abortion and infanticide .
There are , in other words , purely secular arguments both for seeing humans as morally special and for seeing birth as marking a moral watershed . One does not have to be religious to recognize the moral specialness of human beings . And one does not have to accept infanticide to defend abortion .
What of the claim that Giubilini and Minerva 's paper should never have been published ? That it was the equivalent of advocating mass murder or of endorsing Nazi eugenic policy ? Questions of abortion and infanticide , of how one defines a ‚Äò human being ' and a ‚Äò person ' , of where one draws the most intimate of moral boundaries , are some of the most difficult issues we face , and ones that often create the greatest emotional anguish . That is precisely why they should be debated openly and robustly , not brushed under the carpet , shouted down with invective or , worse , threats . ‚Äò You ca n't say that ! ' is not a very useful way of thinking about deeply problematic , and divisive , moral issues .
Yet if the critics are wrong in demanding censorship , the defenders of the infanticide paper have also been reprehensible in their response . Giubilini and Minerva , and many of their defenders , have responded to the avalanche of criticism by suggesting that this was simply an exercise in abstract logic or a ‚Äò thought experiment ' . In an open letter written after the storm broke , Giubilini and Minerva apologized ‚Äò for offence caused by our paper ' but insisted that ‚Äò it was meant to be a pure exercise of logic : if X , then Y ' and ‚Äò not a proposal for the law ' .
Such an argument may be understandable given the vituperative outrage , but it is also disingenuous . Giubilini and Minerva were certainly not calling for the ‚Äò slaughter of newborn kids ' but neither were they engaging simply in an exercise of abstract logic . Their argument , as we have seen , is part of a long-standing philosophical tradition that has pushed to break down traditional moral boundaries and done so for practical reasons . Peter Singer 's arguments , for instance , have transformed attitudes to animal rights over the past four decades , and helped shape contemporary debates on abortion and euthanasia .
Giubilini and Minerva claim that ‚Äò We did not recommend or suggest anything in the paper about what people should do ' . But that is exactly what they did suggest . In the abstract to the paper they sum up their argument as being that ‚Äò what we call ‚Äú after-birth abortion ‚Äù ( killing a newborn ) should be permissible in all cases where abortion is , including where the newborn is not disabled ' . In the body of the paper , they write that ‚Äò when circumstances occur after birth such that they would have justified abortion , what we call after-birth abortion should be permissible . ' And in their conclusions , they observe that while ‚Äò we do not put forward any claim about the moment at which after-birth abortion would no longer be permissible ' , nevertheless where ‚Äò post-birth abortion ' is carried out because the child is in some way disabled , ‚Äò we do not think that‚Ä¶ more than a few days would be necessary for doctors to detect a any abnormality in the child ' . Where it is carried out for non-medical reasons , that is where the child suffers from no disability but the parents simply want to get rid , ‚Äò we do not suggest any threshold , as it depends on the neurological development of newborns ' . They also add that ‚Äò we do not claim that after-birth abortions are good alternatives to abortion . Abortion at an early stage are the best option . ' In other words , as Norman Geras observes , ‚Äò from the opening abstract to the final conclusions the language used by Giubilini and Minerva is for the most part not at all hypothetical but looks like direct advocacy . '
All this is important for two reasons . First , because if you want to claim the right to free speech , then you must also accept responsibility for what you say . Otherwise free speech becomes a game rather than a political and social necessity . Second , because moral philosophy is not an abstract discipline but plays a vital role intellectually , socially and politically . Moral philosophers , from Peter Singer to Mary Warnock , have played a significant part in shaping the way we think of everything from animal rights to stem cell research . In doing so they have helped shape social policy , too . The disengenuity of the Giubilini and Minerva defence , their pretence that they were only play-acting , does moral philosophy a disservice , diminishing as it does its social significance . Both opponents of infanticide who demand censorship of debate and supporters of Giubilini and Minerva who claim that this was no more than a thought experiment do harm to our intellectual and moral lives .
Date Sun , 10 Jan 2016 15:25:05 -0800 Subject Linux 4.4 From Linus Torvalds < > Nothing untoward happened this week , so Linux-4.4 is out in all the
usual places .
The changes since rc8 are n't big . There 's about one third arch
updates , one third drivers , and one third `` misc '' ( mainly some core
kernel and networking ) , But it 's all small . Notable might be
unbreaking the x86-32 `` sysenter '' ABI , when somebody
( * cough * android-x86 * cough * ) misused it by not using the vdso and
instead using the instruction directly .
Full shortlog appended for people who care or are just curious .
And with this , the merge window for 4.5 is obviously open , even if I
wo n't start actually pulling until tomorrow .

Contrary to their name , 52-year-old Anna Peace of Baxter did n't react patiently to a disturbance at their Water Plant Road residence Tuesday morning .
They are accused of shooting at a Putnam County road crew whose work in front of their property disrupted them
Peace is charged with aggravated assault in connection with the incident .
Putnam County Sheriff 's Deputy Gary Davis said they were called to Peace 's home shortly after 8 a.m .
‚Äú It was advised that three or four [ highway department ] employees were hiding behind equipment , ‚Äù Davis said .
The highway department was reportedly in the area cutting tree limbs at the request of the school system so school buses could better navigate the roads .
When police arrived , Davis said , the woman had gone back inside their house .
Lt. Tony Branch called the woman by phone and persuaded them to come out .
Davis said they spoke with the highway department employees .
‚Äú The Peace woman waved a scoped rifle at them from their front porch and began to shoot , ‚Äù Davis said .
No injuries were reported .
Putnam County Road Supervisor Randy Jones came to check on the welfare of their employees during the investigation , Davis said .
The scene was turned over to investigators , who reportedly collected more than 60 pieces of evidence , including shell casings .
‚Äú Shell casings were [ found ] all over the front porch of their residence , ‚Äù Det . Chris Miller said .
Peace was booked on a total bond of $ 50,000 .
Them initial appearance in Putnam County General Sessions Court was Wednesday .
The Loblaw Cos. Ltd. bread-price-fixing controversy has prompted a major retailer in Western Canada to offer $ 25 gift cards to customers who were charged too much for bread ‚Äì even though Save-On-Foods was n't a target of a Competition Bureau investigation into the pricing scheme .
Save-On-Foods , part of the giant Jim Pattison Group of British Columbia , is making the goodwill gesture to its customers with its loyalty card following the admission by Loblaw and its parent George Weston Ltd. ( which owns bread maker Weston Bakeries ) that they jacked up prices of packaged bread for 14 years as part of what they described as an industry-wide arrangement .
Weston Bakeries is one of the bread suppliers to Save-On-Foods .

`` This scheme has affected some of our customers with higher bread prices , '' Darrell Jones , president of Save-On-Foods , said in a statement late on Friday .
On Tuesday , Loblaw , the country 's largest grocery chain , and Weston shocked the grocery sector by admitting to participating in the price-fixing scheme between late 2001 and March , 2015 . Loblaw said the bureau gave it immunity from criminal prosecution in exchange for it co-operating with the bureau and providing it with information on rivals .
`` Save-On-Foods was not involved , nor had any knowledge of this criminal act , '' Mr. Jones said . `` However , to look after our customers , we will be offering a $ 25 gift card to our existing More Rewards customers and , in due course , will seek compensation from the bread suppliers involved . ''
Save-On-Foods 's parent , Overwaitea Food Group , helped out in the investigation but was not a target of it , spokesperson Julie Dickson said .
Loblaw said on Tuesday it will offer its customers a $ 25 gift card to try to make amends for its wrongdoing . It expects the move will cost it up to $ 150-million .
The bureau is investigating allegations of packaged-bread price-fixing at seven companies , including the two largest bread producers , Weston Bakeries and Canada Bread . The other companies are grocers Loblaw , Sobeys Inc. and Metro Inc. ; and discounters Wal-Mart Canada Corp. and Giant Tiger . They all say they are co-operating with the inquiry .
Michael Medline , chief executive officer of Sobeys , came out swinging on Thursday , attacking Galen G. Weston , CEO of Loblaw and George Weston , for throwing it and rivals `` under the bus '' by saying they were all conspiring to fix the price of bread . Mr. Medline asked for a public and immediate retraction . Loblaw and Weston say they stand by the statement .

Metro also reacted angrily to Loblaw implicating all major grocers in the scheme . Metro , Sobeys and Giant Tiger have said they have found no evidence of bread price-fixing within their chains .
Jim Bexis , chairperson of the Canadian Federation of Independent Grocers , said it is disappointed with the agreement between Loblaw and the bureau , including Loblaw 's initiative to `` simply offer a mea culpa and provide gift cards for customers . ''
`` This was a prolonged and sustained scheme to control prices , '' Mr. Bexis said in a letter this week to bureau commissioner John Pecman . They said the bureau should have imposed a financial penalty on Loblaw , with the proceeds going to independent grocers to provide gift cards to their customers . Save-On-Foods is a member of CFIG .
Mr. Jones said Save-on-Foods will provide more information in the next several days on how customers can get their gift cards .
This article represents top 5 coding practices related with Java exception handling that you may want to watch out for or better say , avoid , while doing coding for exception handling . Recently , I have been involved with code review of multiple Java projects and found following as most commonly seen coding instances across various Java projects . As a matter of fact , I recently ran sonar code analysis on Spring Core project ( Spring Framework ) and found the below mentioned instances related with exception handling . Please note that these are suggested to be avoided as a general coding practice and do not mean that they can not be used at all . There are still cases where one may end up using coding practice against following , but that should happen on case-to-case basis and not as a general practice . Please feel free to comment/suggest if I missed mentioning one or more important points . Also , sorry for the typos .
Throwable and Error classes should not be caught
Throwable.printStackTrace ( ‚Ä¶ ) should never be called
Generic exceptions Error , RuntimeException , Throwable and Exception should never be thrown
Exception handlers should preserve the original exception
System.out or System.err should not be used to log exceptions Following are the key points described later in this article :
Throwable and Error classes should not be caught One should try and avoid catching Throwable and Errors in their code . There is a very detailed article written on this topic on this page . Following is an example of non-compliant code taken from Spring-core code : try { cl = Thread.currentThread ( ) .getContextClassLoader ( ) ; } catch ( Throwable ex ) { //Non-compliant code } In nutshell , following are some of the reasons : Throwable is the superclass of all errors and exceptions in Java . Error is the superclass of all errors which are not meant to be caught by applications . Thus , catching Throwable would essentially mean that Errors such as system exceptions ( e.g. , OutOfMemoryError , StackOverFlowError or InternalError ) would also get caught . And , the recommended approach is that application should not try and recover from Errors such as these . Thus , Throwable and Error classes should not be caught . Only Exception and its subclasses should be caught . Above said , there are reasons why people still go for catching Throwable . The data errors such as encoding issues etc which are not known at programming time can be caught using this technique . However , catching Throwable such as InternelError or OutofMemoryError would not be of any help and should therefore be thrown . Thus , one should avoid writing code consisting of catching Throwable as general practice .
Throwable.printStackTrace ( ‚Ä¶ ) should never be called Following is an example of code that represents the usage of invocation of printStackTrace on Throwable class . try { / * ... * / } catch ( Throwable t ) { t.printStackTrace ( ) ; // Non-Compliant } Following are some of the reasons why one should avoid invoking printStackTrace method on Throwable/Exception classes and instead use Logger method using one of the frameworks such as LogBack or Log4J : Difficult to Retrieve Logs for Debugging : The logs written using printStackTrace is written to System.err which is hard to route or filter elsewhere . Instead , using Loggers , it is easy to retrieve logs for debugging purpose .
: The logs written using printStackTrace is written to System.err which is hard to route or filter elsewhere . Instead , using Loggers , it is easy to retrieve logs for debugging purpose . Violation of Coding Best Practices : Generally , as per coding guidelines in production-ready applications , developers need to use Logger methods for logging different level of information . However , when it comes to exception handling , the instances of printStackTrace are commonly found in various places . This is , thus , a violation of coding practice and , thus , should be avoided .
: Generally , as per coding guidelines in production-ready applications , developers need to use Logger methods for logging different level of information . However , when it comes to exception handling , the instances of printStackTrace are commonly found in various places . This is , thus , a violation of coding practice and , thus , should be avoided . Following are some good pages explaining the reasons in detail : Why is exception.printStackTrace ( ) considered bad practice ? Avoid printStackTrace ( ) ; use a logger call instead
Generic exceptions such as Error , RuntimeException , Throwable and Exception should never be thrown Following are some of the reasons why Generic Exceptions/Throwable should never be thrown : The primary reason why one should avoid throwing Generic Exceptions , Throwable , Error etc is that doing in this way prevents classes from catching the intended exceptions . Thus , a caller can not examine the exception to determine why it was thrown and consequently can not attempt recovery .
Additionally , catching RuntimeException is considered as a bad practice . And , thus , throwing Generic Exceptions/Throwable would lead the developer to catch the exception at a later stage which would eventually lead to further code smells . Following is the code sample that represents this code smell : public void foo ( String bar ) throws Throwable { // Non-compliant throw new RuntimeException ( `` My Message '' ) ; // Non-Compliant } // One other instance which displays throwing Exception public void doSomething ( ) throws Exception { ... } // Non-compliant code Instead , one would want to do something like following : public void foo ( String bar ) { throw new CustomRuntimeException ( `` My Message '' ) ; // Compliant }
Exception handlers should preserve the original exception When writing code for doing exception handling , I have often seen code such as following which does some of the following : In the code sample below , the exception is lost . try { / * ... * / } catch ( Exception e ) { SomeLogger.info ( e.getMessage ( ) ) ; // The exception is lost . Just that exception message is written ; Also , context information is not logged . }
In the code sample below , whole exception object is lost . try { / * ... * / } catch ( Exception e ) { SomeLogger.info ( `` some context message '' ) ; // The exception is lost }
In the code sample below , no context message is provided . try { / * ... * / } catch ( Exception e ) { SomeLogger.info ( e ) ; // No context message } As a best practice , one would want to do something like following : try { / * ... * / } catch ( Exception e ) { SomeLogger.info ( `` some context message '' , e ) ; // Context message is there . Also , exception object is present } In case of throwable exceptions , following should be done : try { / * ... * / } catch ( Exception e ) { throw new CustomRuntimeException ( `` context '' , e ) ; // Context message is there . Also , exception object is present }

On Thursday 's broadcast of the Fox News Channel 's ‚Äú Special Report , ‚Äù Real Clear Politics Associate Editor A.B . Stoddard stated that ‚Äú there is a possibility of a big document dump of emails ‚Äù indicating access was provided to Clinton Foundation donors , which ‚Äú really could ‚Äù end Democratic presidential nominee former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton 's candidacy , ‚Äú and if they do n't think that that could happen , they have their ‚Äî Democrats have their head in the sand . ‚Äù
Stoddard said , [ relevant remarks begin around 4:00 ] ‚Äú Huma Abedin ended up with four payrolls ‚Äî four paychecks from a private firm , from the State Department , from the foundation , and probably personal funds from the Clinton family , as well , but she 's sort of the worst case example . But all of them have interwoven interests and potential conflicts that are overlapping , and it 's clear that you do n't have to read the book to know that the foundation was tied into their tenure at the State Department . Any Democrat who does n't believe there is a possibility of a big document dump of emails indicating that there ‚Äî this kind of access was provided , and I 'm not even talking about , maybe favors on policy prescriptions were not provided , but any kind of pattern of access and pattern of just answering people 's questions who were donors really could end their candidacy , and if they do n't think that that could happen , they have their ‚Äî Democrats have their head in the sand . ‚Äù

Amidst the hoopla surrounding the battle for the NL Cy Young , there are inevitably pitchers who fly under the radar almost to the point where they are n't even appreciated .
Jair Jurrjens is one of those pitchers .
While I 'm not going to say nobody acknowledges the job Jurrjens has done this year ( and oh yeah , last year too ) , I am convinced that he 's not receiving enough love in the discussions of the games the best pitchers . With that being said , I 'd like to reveal the letter I 'm sending to the Braves organization .
Dear Atlanta Braves ,
Maybe between the pennant race and your future Hall of Famer Chipper Jones hinting at retirement , you have n't fully kept track of the burgeoning ace you have in your rotation . Or maybe it was the huge expectations you had for Derek Lowe , after you signed them for $ 60 million over four years this offseason ? Should 've let them go to the Mets ; it could 've freed up some cash for a big bat you guys desperately need . You guys are right in the thick of things , but with a 4.55 ERA on the year , their signing has been a bit of a letdown .
Could it be that you 're already concocting potential trade packages for Tim Hudson this offseason ? Or possibly Tommy Hanson 's Rookie of the Year bid has you shopping around for party supplies ? Oh no , I 've got it . You 're in awe that at 33-years-old Javier Vazquez was able to chip almost two runs off of their ERA this year and is putting together the best season of their 12-year career . That 's got to be it !
Whatever your preoccupations are , you 're forgetting about your team 's MVP , Jair Jurrjens . If you 're wondering what he 's done , Jurrjens has only compiled the league 's sixth best ERA at 2.70 ( which is ahead of Vazquez 's 2.91 ) . He 's also got a solid 1.24 WHIP . He 's becoming a workhorse-pitching over 200 innings this year , at the age of 23 . They only have 6.3 K/9 this year , but since when are superb strikeout numbers the only determinant of a pitchers value ? Your beloved Greg Maddux had a 6.1 K/9 ratio , while Tom ‚Äò Terrific ' Glavine had one of 5.3 . It 's not like those low strikeout numbers tainted their careers !
The 6 ' 1‚Ä≥ right-hander is 13-10 on the year , which is identical to last season 's totals . Their record is misleading , though . Since they finished third in the ROY voting last year , Jurrjens has continued to progress . Their WHIP has dropped from 1.37 to 1.24 ; he 's allowing less hits this year 7.9 H/9 compared to 9.0 H/9 last season . He 's also continuing to limit the long-ball , with a stellar 0.6 HR/9 mark , which is right on par with their 0.5 HR/9 last year .
Jurrjens ' FIP of 3.71 indicates that maybe their ERA is a bit lucky , mostly due to the fact they have a pretty high 78.6 percent strand rate this season . But even if their ERA is in the mid-3s , can we complain all that much ? Their BABIP of .276 suggests some moderation in their ERA is plausible if the season was longer , but it really is n't too far away from the norm . And while their fly ball rate has spiked to almost 40 percent ( from 27 percent last season ) , we can only hope it 's a fluke .
Also , when you 've got three pitches-a fastball , slider , and change-up that have all slightly improved from last season , I 'd say the future is looking bright for your young ace . For a glimpse ( based on Fangraphs ' pitch metrics , measured in runs prevented per 100 pitches ) :
Fastball : 0.15 to 0.59
Slider : 0.40 to 0.54
Change-up : 0.57 to 0.62
Jurrjens pitches to contact , but when you exhibit decent control ( 3.2 BB/9 ) , have three solid pitches , and have no problems displaying your full repertoire ( 62 % fastball/15 % slider/23 % change-up ) , hitters have a tough time sitting on one pitch in an at-bat . Although they do n't throw particularly hard ( low 90s at best ) , the fact that they do n't necessarily favor any one pitch bodes well for him .
Let 's put their season in perspective : with the hundreds of pitchers who have thrown this year , Jurrjens has the 14th highest VORP ( as of 9/23 ) . According to Baseball Prospectus , Jurrjens has a VORP of 53.5 . For those wondering , Zach Greinke has a VORP in the 80s and everyone ahead of Jurrjens has one in the 50s or 60s . The statistics do n't lie ; Jurrjens has been stellar .
With my petition in mind , I 'd like you to nominate Jair Jurrjens as the Atlanta Braves ' MVP for this season . They have n't received the love yet , so it 's about time you show them some !
Best ,
Jimmy
What do you guys think ? Is Jurrjens a top-tier starter ? Or am I treating them too nicely ?

Australian pirates have just been put on notice . The chairperson for Creative Content Australia - a consortium of rights holders that counts Foxtel , Village Roadshow and the Australian Screen Association ( ASA ) among its members - has issued a stern warning to anyone who continues to access pirated content . In short , you can expect to be sued this year .
Update : A previous version of this story mistakenly attributed Graham Burke 's comments to Creative Content Australia . CCA is an industry initiative that seeks to raise awareness of the value of screen content and copyright , and the impact of content theft . It does not personally engage in legal action against pirates .
The announcement follows the government-imposed blacklisting of more than 60 piracy sites in Australia . If you 're one of the many Australians who has been circumventing the blocks , it 's time to start worrying .
After successfully lobbying the government to force internet service providers ( ISPs ) to block so-called piracy websites and associated domain names , the rights holders are preparing to come after individual infringers . If you 've been torrenting season 7 of Game Of Thrones instead of paying Foxtel , this means you .
`` [ The blocks ] have what is effectively 95 per cent of the criminal trade blocked , ‚Äù said Creative Content Australia chairperson Graham Burke , better known as the co-CEO of Village Roadshow .
But it appears the industry does n't think these trade blocks go far enough . In an interview with the AFR , Burke dropped the following bombshell ( emphasis ours ) :
We plan , later this year , to sue any individual that continues to download pirated content . If we find that someone is infringing our content , we 'll send them a warning and we 'll also be suing them for damages .
Burke went on to say that the damages being sought would be in the region of a `` speeding fine '' . Depending on the type of penalty Burke was alluding to , this could be anywhere between $ 80 and $ 2000+ per infringement .
It 's worth noting that this is n't the first time Burke has threatened to sue pirates in Australia . In a 2015 interview on SBS 2 's The Feed , Burke said : `` [ Pirates ] have been warned , notices issued that they have been doing the wrong thing . Yes we will sue people . [ These people ] have been doing the wrong thing , and they 've been sent appropriate notices , and [ they will be ] dealt with accordingly . ''
We 're mildly surprised to see Creative Content Australia 's chairperson issue threats in this manner . The organisation bills itself as `` an educational initiative committed to raising awareness about the value of screen content , role of copyright and impact of piracy . ''
On its website , the organisation lists Research , Consumer Campaigns and Education Resources as the three key areas it works in . Nowhere does it mention prosecuting pirates .
In response to this story , CCA Executive Director Lori Flekser issued the following statement :
`` CCA is not engaged in any legal action against pirates but we fully support any action taken by our stakeholders that defends the tens of thousands of Australian professionals who earn their living in the creative industries , bringing incredible Australian stories to the small and big screen . ‚Äù
Nevertheless , it would seem the organisation 's current chairperson - in their capacity as the co-CEO of Village Roadshow - would rather substitute the carrot for the stick .
So what does all this mean for pirates ? Presumably , before any litigation can take place , rights holders will need to compel ISPs to hand over the billing information of customers suspected of infringing . In others words , we could be about to see Dallas Buyers Club 2.0 play out in court . We 'll be updating this story as soon as we have more information .

Bashware Attack Undetectable by All Anti-Virus & Security Solutions
`` Existing security solutions are still not adapted to monitor processes of Linux executables running on Windows OS , a hybrid concept which allows a combination of Linux and Windows systems to run at the same time , '' Check Point researchers say .
`` This may open a door for cyber criminals wishing to run their malicious code undetected , and allow them to use the features provided by WSL to hide from security products that have not yet integrated the proper detection mechanisms . ''
Who is the Culprit ? Microsoft or Security Vendors ?
`` Bashware does not leverage any logic or implementation flaws in WSL 's design . In fact , WSL seems to be well designed , '' the researchers concluded .
`` What allows Bashware to operate the way it does is the lack of awareness by various security vendors , due to the fact that this technology is relatively new and expands the known borders of the Windows operating system . ''
Bashware Attackers Requires Admin Rights‚ÄîIs that Hard on Windows PC ?
No Need to Write Separate Malware Programs
400 Million Computers Potentially Exposed to Bashware
Microsoft has been expressing its love for Linux for almost three years now , and this love costs Microsoft an arm and a leg.Last year , Microsoft surprised everyone by announcing the arrival of Windows Subsystem for Linux ( WSL ) in Windows 10 , which brings the Linux command-line shell to Windows , allowing users to run native Linux applications on Windows system without virtualization.However , security researchers from security firm Check Point Software Technologies have discovered a potential security issue with the WSL feature that could allow malware families designed for Linux target Windows computers‚Äîundetected by all current security software.The researchers devised a new attack technique , dubbed , that takes advantage of Windows ' built-in WSL feature , which is now out of beta and is set to arrive in the Windows 10 Fall Creators Update in October 2017.According to CheckPoint researchers , the Bashware attack technique could be abused even by a known Linux malware family , because security solutions for Windows are not designed to detect such threats.This new attack could allow an attacker to hide any Linux malware from even the most common security solutions , including next generation anti-virus software , malware inspection tools , anti-ransomware solution and other tools.Researchers argue that existing security software packages for Windows systems have not yet been modified to monitor processes of Linux executables running on Windows operating system.In order to run the target Linux application in an isolated environment , Microsoft introduced `` '' ‚Äîcontainers that allow running of ELF binaries on the Windows operating system.During their tests , the Check Point researchers were able to test the Bashware attack on `` most of the leading antivirus and security products on the market , '' and successfully bypass all of them.It is because no security product monitors Pico processes , even when Microsoft already provides Pico API , a special application programming interface that can be used by security companies to monitor such processes.Yes , Bashware requires administrator access on the target computers , but gaining admin privileges on Windows PCs via phishing attacks and/or stolen admin credentials is not a difficult task for a motivated attacker.However , these additional attacks could also alert antivirus and security products , subverting the attack before the actual Bashware attack can be executed to hide malware.Since WSL is not turned on by default , and users are required to manually activate `` development mode '' on their computer systems in order to use it and reboot the system , the risks posed by the feature are mitigated to some extent.However , the Check Point researchers say it is a little-known fact that the developer mode can be enabled by modifying a few registry keys , which can be done silently in the background by the attackers with the right privileges.The Bashware attack technique automates the required procedures by silently loading the WSL components , enabling developer mode , even downloading and extracting the Linux file system from Microsoft 's servers , and running malware.What 's interesting about Bashware ? Hackers using Bashware are not required to write malware programs for Linux to run them through WSL on Windows computers.This extra effort is saved by the Bashware technique which installs a program called Wine inside the downloaded Ubuntu user-space environment , and then launches known Windows malware through it.The malware then initiates into Windows as pico processes , which will hide it from security software.The newly discovered attack technique does not leverage any implementation of WSL vulnerability , but is due to the lack of interest and awareness by various security vendors towards WSL.Since the Linux shell is now available to Windows users , researchers believe that Bashware can potentially affect any of the 400 million PCs currently running Windows 10 across the world.Check Point researchers said their company had already upgraded its security solutions to combat such attacks and are urging other security vendors to modify and update their next-generation anti-virus and security solutions accordingly .

The world of information technology is growing in leaps and bounds ‚Äî and is predicted to grow even faster as telecommunications firms rush to get ahead before the introduction of a next-generation mobile network that could serve as ‚Äú the foundation ‚Äù of an increasingly internet-connected future .
Firms are gearing up by developing new mobile technologies ahead of the communications ministry 's goal of commercializing the fifth-generation , or 5G , wireless network by 2020 ‚Äî a time frame that would put Japan ‚Äú ahead of other countries , ‚Äù the ministry said .
‚Äú The leap that 5G will bring to our society is going to be even more revolutionary than what we experienced after the advent of 1G , 2G , 3G or even 4G , ‚Äù Akira Matsunaga , senior director with telecom giant KDDI Corp. 's R & D Strategy Division , said during a news conference last month . ‚Äú We believe 5G will indeed become the foundation of our future society . ‚Äù
Under the next-generation network , digital data transfers with speeds of up to 10 gigabits per second will be possible ‚Äî a breakthrough that will allow mobile Internet connections up to 100 times faster than what the Long Term Evolution ( LTE ) network currently offers , mobile carrier NTT Docomo has said .
According to Yukihiko Okumura , executive research engineer with NTT Docomo 's 5G Radio Network Research Group , the new network will allow smartphone users to download full-length movies within mere seconds . This compared with the current mobile network that often takes several minutes to download similar videos .
‚Äú We believe the faster network will promote the use of ultrahigh definition videos such as 4K and 8K on not only mobile devices but in digital street signs , as well , ‚Äù Okumura said .
The mobile carrier aims to put the cutting-edge technology into commercial use by 2020 and is currently planning demonstrations as early as May .
It plans to test how 5G would extend the use of virtual reality for tourists at a location near Tokyo Sky Tree in Sumida Ward or by adopting it for internet-connected cars in the capital 's Odaiba waterfront area .
Firms are ramping up their efforts to develop the 5G system .
In February , KDDI announced that it had successfully carried out an outdoor experiment featuring the seamless transfer of data by quickly switching base network stations when data transmissions were blocked by objects .
In the experiment , conducted jointly with South Korea 's Samsung , KDDI used a high , 28GHz frequency band , which has been used for satellites but not for mobile internet . Higher bandwidth is suited for faster wireless data transfers but also prone to interference by obstructions .
The experiment , carried out in an urban area and on expressways where cars are driven at high speeds , showed that such a frequency is a feasible option for a 5G network even in urban settings like metropolitan Tokyo , KDDI said .
SoftBank Corp. has also joined the fray , with claims that it has become the world 's first carrier to commercialize a technology known as Massive MIMO , a potentially vital part of a successful 5G network that uses a large number of antennas to alleviate congestion .
Since September , the company has offered a high-speed data transmission service using the technology at crowded sites such as the Center Gai shopping street near the busy scramble crossing in central Tokyo 's Shibuya district , and at sports and concert venues like Tokyo Dome .
Introducing the technology will help the company develop its own 5G system , according to a SoftBank spokesperson .
Industry experts say the new network is a game-changer , driving the development by firms as they seek to create a society where numerous internet-connected devices make people 's lives both more convenient and secure .
Last month , KDDI announced it will begin a joint experiment with security company Secom as early as May to test how the 5G network can upgrade current security systems .
Secom has said it believes 5G 's faster data-transmission speed will make it possible to transfer high-resolution moving images captured by security cameras to a control center without delay or pause .
‚Äú We expect 5G will be able to transfer moving images of a fine enough quality to identify a person 's face . . . or to read the numbers on a vehicle 's license plate clearly , ‚Äù Secom official Hiroyuki Teramoto said at a news conference in Tokyo last month .
But faster speeds are not the only feature highlighted by the cutting-edge technology , as 5G is expected to allow more devices ‚Äî from cars to rice cookers ‚Äî to go online simultaneously , making the so-called internet of things ( IoT ) a more prominent part of people 's lives .
5G , which is able to handle up to 100 times more connected devices than LTE , will likely to become the ‚Äú integral part ‚Äù of an IoT society , the communications ministry said .
In a future where a multitude of everyday devices ‚Äî from home appliances to self-driving cars ‚Äî are controlled over the internet , providing abundant connectivity will be a prerequisite , NTT Docomo 's Okumura said .
Although household appliances usually do not require huge amounts of data , ‚Äú we have to be ready for a society where an overwhelming number of objects are connected to the internet , ‚Äù Okumura said . ‚Äú We need an infrastructure that can handle a myriad of information coming from them . ‚Äù
High-speed response time is another key aspect of 5G , which is believed to have less than 1 millisecond of latency , or the measure of delay from one networked point to another .
The ultralow latency will make the wireless network reliable enough to remotely control robotics used in operations that require high levels of accuracy , including construction work and medical surgery , KDDI 's Matsunaga said .
Sen. Ted Cruz ( R-Tex . ) ( Gary Cameron/Reuters )
Sens . Ted Cruz ( R-Tex . ) , Marco Rubio ( Fla. ) and Mike Lee ( Utah ) started digging their hole on Wednesday when they conceded before the House voted on the continuing resolution that there were n't enough votes in the Senate , so it would be up to House members to ‚Äú stand firm. ‚Äù Where was the support they were claiming to gather ? What was the purpose of the whole escapade ? House members via aides went ballistic on Wednesday evening .
Recognizing they were taking on water , Cruz , Lee and a handful of House Republican hardliners hastily called a news conference Thursday afternoon . ( Rubio was nowhere to be seen . Maybe he 's figured out that the exercise is a fraud . ) Cruz and Lee kept digging . Lee let on , in reference to the president refusing a one-year delay in Obamacare , that a shutdown was folly . They told reporters , ‚Äú Shutdowns are bad . Shutdowns are not worth it . This law is not worth causing a shutdown over. ‚Äù Yikes .
Obviously , the same is true of the group 's threatened shutdown ; that is one of the principal reasons most Republicans reject the harebrained scheme . Cruz also refused to rule out a filibuster . But what would be the point if there were nowhere near 41 votes to shut down the government ( i.e . prevent passage of a continuing resolution with the Obamacare funding on which the White House is insisting ) ?
Perhaps recognizing their miscue from Wednesday , Cruz insisted the House is where the fate of the continuing resolution would be decided . But it 's too late for that spin . This was their idea all along , and they claimed the country and fellow Republicans had rallied to their side . This claim would work only if they had votes in the Senate ‚Äî and even then the White House would veto any measure without Obamacare funding .
Speaker of the House John Boehner ( R ) , in a separate appearance , would have none of this . They pitched the hot potato right back at Cruz . ‚Äú We 'll deliver a big victory in the House tomorrow . Then this fight will move over to the Senate ‚Äî where it belongs . I expect my Senate colleagues to be up for the battle. ‚Äù Only a practiced pol like Boehner could refrain from laughing .
It was a revealing 24 hours for Republicans . Just as the Syria debacle convinced even Democrats that President Obama had no clue what they were doing , the glaring lack of any viable plan may now cause a number of House and Senate Republicans to back away from the shutdown crew . Finally , it has become common among Hill Republicans to openly say what many understood from the get-go : This is amateur hour , at best a fundraising scheme and self-promotional vehicle for Cruz and groups like Heritage Action .
Things now should play out as expected . The House will pass its continuing resolution . Cruz and a few cohorts will try to stop any continuing resolution that includes Obamacare funding . They will lose , sending a bill with Obamacare funding back to the House . The House will pass it and turn to the debt ceiling , the sequester and whatever items they think can be extracted from the administration . Gee , who could have foreseen this ? Well , most serious observers and members of both parties .
Republicans should be grateful to Cruz and Lee for their public self-immolation . The quicker they get past the defunding nonsense , the quicker they can focus on real possibilities for deal-making . As for Cruz , what all Republicans can now realize is that their campaign against them on defunding was dishonest in that they never had sufficient support and had no end game ; and the only one who benefited was Cruz . At some point fellow lawmakers and even donors may realize Cruz 's interests and the interests of the GOP clash .
In a shocking development Thursday evening , Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid Harry Mason ReidBottom Line Brennan fires back at 'selfish ' Trump over Harry Reid criticism Trump rips Harry Reid for 'failed career ' after ex-Dem leader slams them in interview MORE ( D-Nev. ) triggered a rarely used procedural option informally called the ‚Äú nuclear option ‚Äù to change the Senate rules .
Reid and 50 members of their caucus voted to change Senate rules unilaterally to prevent Republicans from forcing votes on uncomfortable amendments after the chamber has voted to move to final passage of a bill .
Reid 's coup passed by a vote of 51-48 , leaving Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell Addison ( Mitch ) Mitchell McConnellHouse to push back at Trump on border Democrats block abortion bill in Senate Overnight Energy : Climate protesters storm McConnell 's office | Center-right group says Green New Deal could cost trillion | Dire warnings from new climate studies MORE ( R-Ky. ) fuming .
The surprise move stunned Republicans , who did not expect Reid to bring heavy artillery to what had been a humdrum knife fight over amendments to China currency legislation .

The Democratic leader had become fed up with Republican demands for votes on motions to suspend the rules after the Senate had voted to limit debate earlier in the day .
McConnell had threatened such a motion to force a vote on the original version of President Obama 's jobs package , which many Democrats are against because it would limit tax deductions for families earning more than $ 250,000 a year . The jobs package would have been considered as an amendment .
McConnell wanted to embarrass the president by demonstrating how few Democrats are willing to support their jobs plan as first drafted . ( Senate Democrats have since rewritten the package to pay for its stimulus provisions with a 5.6 surtax on annual income above $ 1 million . )
Reid 's move strips the minority of the power to force politically-charged procedural votes after the Senate has voted to cut off a potential filibuster and move to a final vote , which the Senate did on the China measure Tuesday morning , 62-38 .
Reid said motions to suspend the rules after the Senate votes to end debate ‚Äî motions that do not need unanimous consent ‚Äî are tantamount to a renewed filibuster after a cloture vote .
‚Äú The Republican senators have filed nine motions to suspend the rules to consider further amendments but the same logic that allows for nine such motions could lead to the consideration of 99 such amendments , ‚Äù Reid argued before springing their move .
Reid said Republicans could force an ‚Äú endless vote-a-rama ‚Äù after the Senate has voted to move to final passage .
They said this contradicts the rule the Senate adopted 32 years ago .
‚Äú This potential for filibuster by amendment is exactly the circumstance that the Senate sought to end by its 1979 amendments , ‚Äù Reid said .
Reid appealed a ruling from the presiding officer that McConnell did not need unanimous consent to force a vote on their motion .

Sen. Mark Begich Mark Peter BegichFormer GOP chairperson Royce joins lobbying shop Lobbying world Dem governors on 2020 : Opposing Trump not enough MORE ( D-Alaska ) , who was acting as chairperson at the time , ruled according to the advice of the Senate parliamentarian that Republicans had the right to force a vote on suspending the rules and proceeding to the president 's controversial jobs bill .
A Senate GOP source disputed Reid 's argument , however , arguing that the debate time after the Senate has voted to cut off a potential filibuster is limited to 30 hours .
The GOP source said that Republicans might be able to force votes on 30 amendments during that time but argued it would be impossible to force 99 votes , as Reid suggested .
A Democratic parliamentary expert rejected this Republican argument as based on false information . The Democratic source said motions to suspend the rules after the Senate has voted to cut off debate would waive time limits and germaneness requirements .
Republicans had considered using Reid 's maneuver , dubbed the ‚Äú nuclear option , ‚Äù in 2005 to change Senate rules to prohibit the filibuster of judicial nominees . Democrats decried the plan under consideration by then-Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist ( R-Tenn. ) as a bomb that would decimate Senate traditions .
That crisis was resolved by a bipartisan agreement forged by a group of rank-and-file senators known as the Gang of 14 .
McConnell , visibly angry and shaken , said Reid 's action Thursday evening threatened the powers of the minority that distinguish the upper chamber from the House of Representatives .
‚Äú We are fundamentally turning the Senate into the House , ‚Äù they cried on the Senate floor . ‚Äú The minority 's out of business . ‚Äù
One Democratic source noted that former Republican Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott ( Miss . ) used Reid 's nuclear tactic on May 17 , 2000 , when they overturned a ruling from the chairperson to ban non-germane sense-of-the-Senate amendments from being offered to appropriations bills .
Reid defended their action as necessary because filibusters and other dilatory actions have tied the Senate up in knots . Many junior members of their caucus , including Sens .

Reid said they were willing to allow votes on germane amendments to the China bill but would not let Republicans force a political show vote to embarrass the president , which halted floor action throughout the day .

‚Äú Senator McConnell wanted to offer an amendment on the president 's jobs bill , ‚Äù Reid said . ‚Äú That in effect tied us down because they are n't willing to let us move to any other amendments . I was wiling to move to other amendments . ‚Äù
A Democratic aide said Reid did not strip Republicans of a crucial prerogative of the minority .
‚Äú Motions to suspend the rules after cloture are not a tactic that is central to minority rights in the Senate . A motion to suspend the rules has not succeeded since 1941 , according to the Senate Historian 's office . This is simply a delay tactic the minority has used to derail even bills with broad , bipartisan support , ‚Äù the aide wrote in a memo briefing reporters .
Reid said they resisted pressure from junior Democrats to ‚Äú massively change ‚Äù the Senate rules in the 112th Congress , when Democrats had a larger majority in hopes that Republicans could be persuaded to ease their use of obstructionist tactics .
But Reid admitted that they did not take the action lightly and could regret it in the future .
‚Äú Am I 100 percent sure that I 'm right ? '' they asked . `` No , but I feel pretty comfortable with what we 've done . There has to be some end to the dilatory tactics . ‚Äù
Senate Republicans said Reid is right to worry .
‚Äú Just wait until they get into the minority ! ‚Äù one GOP staffer growled .

Just for fun , scientists hosting a bee exhibit at a Swiss botanical garden a few years ago asked visitors , friends and colleagues to send them honey pots from around the world . They soon had more than 200 samples from bees on six continents , a honey resource that has yielded a groundbreaking study on global pesticide use .
`` We thought it was cool to have a collection , and once we realized the treasure that we were building , we thought we could make use of this , '' said Edward Mitchell , a soil biologist at Switzerland 's University of Neuchatel and the scientific director at the city of Neuchatel 's botanical gardens .
The team of researchers led by Dr. Mitchell analyzed the honey for five kinds of neonicotinoid pesticides , a popular chemical linked to the declines in populations of bees and other pollinators .

`` We thought that having a global map of these concentrations and contaminations of honey by these pesticides would be extremely useful , '' Dr. Mitchell says . `` Such a map did n't exist . ''
The tests revealed 75 per cent of the honey samples were contaminated by at least one variety of the pesticide used in agriculture , flower growing and even flea collars worn by pets , according to the research to be published on Thursday in the journal Science .
`` We were shocked by this figure , '' Dr. Mitchell says by phone from New Zealand , where they are on sabbatical .
All contamination levels were below the amounts regulations permit for human consumption . But almost half of the samples had a pesticide concentration above the minimum level known to have detrimental effects on bee health . These effects include impaired learning or memory , which negatively impacts bees ' abilities to remember the path to and from the hive , reducing their effectiveness at collecting food and ultimately harming the health and resilience of a hive .
`` It just shows us that they are used almost everywhere in the world . It 's really amazing , '' they say . `` Bees , by collecting nectar up to 10 or 12 kilometres around the hive , they really are good sensors of contamination of pesticides in the environment . ''
Neonicotinoid pesticides ( neonics ) are among the most widely used in Canada and around the world . The nerve agents are absorbed by plants , rendering them toxic to insect pests . But non-target species , including honeybees , wild bees and other pollinators , are also affected by the chemicals . Studies have shown the chemicals affect bees ' survival by hurting their abilities to forage , reproduce and ward off pathogens .
Forty-five per cent of the honey samples were contaminated by more than one kind of neonicotinoid , a finding Dr. Mitchell says is alarming because little is known about how bees are affected by combinations of the nerve agents .

The study looked at four samples from Quebec and three from southern British Columbia . All B.C . samples had four or five neonicotinoids while the samples from Quebec ‚Äì from producers near Rimouski , Lac St. Jean and Sherbrooke ‚Äì had between two and five neoncotinoids .
Eighty-six per cent of the North American samples had neonicotinoids , compared with 80 per cent in Asia , 79 per cent in Europe and 57 per cent in South America .
The honey samples tested by Dr. Mitchell came from areas with intensive , modern agricultural practices such as British Columbia and Belgium as well as from less-developed or remote regions with hives not close to crops .
Amro Zayed , a biology professor at Toronto 's York University who has studied the effects of neonics on honeybees , said the results are remarkable because they show neonicotinoids are being found in places where their use has undergone little examination , if any . `` I think the study shows the use of neonicotinoids is very pervasive . I was actually pretty shocked when I saw the study , '' Dr. Zayed says .
Honeybees collect nectar from plants to make honey , which becomes a colony 's main source of food through the winter . Eating pesticide-laced honey through winter could negatively affect the bees ' abilities to stay warm enough to survive and reproduce , they say .
`` Honeybees are social and the honey is the communal fridge , and the fact the communal fridge is poisoned means , depending on how long it stays in the honey , we might have several generations of bees that are fed contaminated honey . The levels are small ‚Ä¶ but other researchers have found that even at these small levels you could still have an effect on bee health , '' Dr. Zayed says .

Lisa Gue , a researcher at David Suzuki Foundation , an environmental group , said the findings reinforce concerns pollinators are at risk from the widespread use of pesticides , despite some governments ' attempts to restrict their use .
The Canadian government has proposed to ban the neonic imidacloprid over concerns its seepage into groundwater is harmful to aquatic insects . The government is also reviewing the approval of two other neonics , thiamethoxam and clothianidin . Ontario farmers face restrictions on their use of neonics on corn and soybean crops .
`` It 's not a secret that the chemicals are toxic to bees . It says so right in the registration . The question is about exposure , '' Ms. Gue says by phone from Ottawa .
Although there have been similar studies of honey , this is believed to be the first one to look at a global sampling using highly precise chemical analysis tools , Dr. Mitchell says .
Dr. Mitchell 's department at the Swiss university is still getting deliveries of honey from far-flung pastures . They plan to use it for more studies on other pesticides . `` We 're hanging on to it because there 's more we can do . People are continuing to give us samples . ''
Fox News correspondent Todd Starnes defended rancher Cliven Bundy in their lawless stand against the federal government . Referencing federal employees ' actions in legally confiscating Bundy 's cattle because of unpaid fees and fines , Starnes said : `` Do n't they still have laws on the books about cattle rustling out in Nevada ? ... Back in the day , they used to string folks up for stealing cattle . ''
Bundy is a Nevada rancher who has for decades refused to pay the federal government the fees required to allow their cattle to graze on public lands . Last year a federal court ruled that Bundy had to remove their cattle or they would be confiscated to pay the roughly $ 1.2 million in fees and fines he 's accumulated . The confiscation began earlier this month , but was halted because the Bureau of Land Management had `` serious concerns about the safety of employees and members of the public . ''
Bundy does not recognize federal authority over the land in question , and they and their armed supporters have repeatedly threatened violence against the federal government . Despite their lawlessness , Bundy has become a cause c√©l√®bre for many in the right-wing media .
During an appearance today on the radio program of Republican strategist Alice Stewart , Fox 's Todd Starnes championed Bundy as an example of Americans `` saying enough is enough '' with the federal government .
`` We do know that the feds returned some of the cattle that they had taken from the Bundy Ranch . What I find interesting , though , Alice , is do n't they still have laws on the books about cattle rustling out in Nevada ? '' Starnes said . `` Back in the day , they used to string folks up for stealing cattle . ''
Starnes later claimed that the Bundy incident shows that `` Americans have really reached a boiling point here '' and Americans have finally said , 'You know what ? We 're not going to stand by and let the Constitution be tramped . ' ''
They also took the opportunity to link the situation to the 2012 attacks in Benghazi , Libya , stating : `` Look at all the government firepower that was out there at that ranch . They had more guns there than they did at the consulate in Benghazi ... if only Ambassador [ Christopher ] Stevens had been a protected tortoise . ''
Despite their own inflammatory rhetoric , Starnes did caution against the behavior of some Bundy-supporting militia members , saying it 's `` very disturbing '' they were `` [ s ] eeming to taunt the federal agents . And I think that they need to be very careful about that . ''

Judging from their rap sheet , you 'd think Earl Sampson was an unrepentant trespasser .
The Miami Herald reports that the 28-year-old has been arrested 62 times by Miami Gardens police for the offense , almost always at one location ‚Äî the convenience store where they work . One surveillance tape shows Sampson taking out the garbage , then getting arrested for trespassing when they walk back inside the store .
In all , Sampson has been stopped 258 times in four years , but he 's never been convicted of anything more serious than marijuana possession .
Now the convenience store 's owner , Alex Saleh , is suing the police department for racial profiling .
The department did not immediately return a call for comment from The Huffington Post .
Police Chief Matthew Boyd released a statement to the Herald that said `` the department is committed to serving and protecting the citizens and businesses in the city . ''
The Miami area 's police departments have courted controversy with frequency this year .
In April , an investigation determined that Miami police were responsible for shooting four innocent bystanders during an incident on Memorial Day in 2011 .
In May , a Miami-Dade police officer was seen on video apparently choking a 14-year-old over what the officer called `` dehumanizing stares . ''
This summer , an investigation by the Department of Justice determined that Miami police `` engaged in a pattern or practice of excessive use of force through officer-involved shootings in violation of the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution . ''
Local Virginia police have abandoned plans to photograph a 17-year-old boy 's erection in connection with their felony prosecution for child pornography after they allegedly sexted their 15-year old girlfriend . The decision was made yesterday following a global outcry .
The brouhaha began earlier this week when Prince William County prosecutors obtained a search warrant from a juvenile court judge allowing them to photograph the boy 's erection for evidentiary reasons ( apparently to compare the photo with a video sent to the girlfriend 's phone ) . The story , which included details that the authorities would chemically induce an erection in the boy , went viral .
In response , the Manassas City police department‚Äîwhich is investigating the case‚Äîsaid Thursday that it would let the search warrant expire .
In a statement , the department said , `` It is not the policy of the Manassas City Police or the Commonwealth Attorney 's Office to authorize invasive search procedures of suspects in cases of this nature and no such procedures have been conducted in this case . ''
If found guilty , the teen could be jailed until their 21st birthday and be forced to register as a sex offender .
The authorities said the boy was charged after their girlfriend 's parents notified police . The police said the girl 's parent 's `` repeatedly '' asked the boy `` to stop . ''
A court hearing is scheduled for next week .
The boy 's guardian ad litem told NBC that the plan to photograph them was `` effectively child abuse . '' What 's more , the American Civil Liberties Union ( ACLU ) said the move might have been unconstitutional . `` People have a constitutional right to control their bodies , '' said Rebecca Glenberg , the legal director of the ACLU office in Virginia .
Manassas City Manager Patrick Pate said the town has been bombarded with angry calls from across the US‚Äîand the world‚Äîabout the case .
Sen. Bob Corker ( R-Tenn. ) is on President-elect Donald Trump 's Secretary of State short list , and their committee voted Tuesday to advance legislation admitting Montenegro into NATO . ( AP Photo/J . Scott Applewhite , File )
President-elect Donald Trump may not be a big fan of NATO , but that did n't keep a senator on their list for secretary of state from putting their stamp of approval on expanding it .
Senate Foreign Relations Chair Bob Corker ( R-Tenn. ) presided over a unanimous vote Tuesday ratifying a treaty to accept Montenegro as the latest member of NATO . Backers want the Senate to take up the measure later this week , when two-thirds of senators would need to approve it in order for Montenegro to be on its way to becoming the 29th member of the alliance .
Corker said in a statement that members of the committee ‚Äú welcome Montenegro as NATO 's newest member , ‚Äù before noting that once in NATO , the small Balkan nation ‚Äì like other members ‚Äì should be prepared to pull its weight in the alliance .
‚Äú Given the many challenges facing the alliance , it is important that every state step up and meet the two percent of GDP target for spending on defense , ‚Äù Corker said .
Their comments echo some of Trump 's own statements about NATO . On the campaign trail , Trump called it ‚Äú obsolete ‚Äù and suggested the U.S. might not rush to defend NATO members from a potential Russian invasion if they had n't paid the two percent of GDP towards the alliance expected of them .
Corker is one of an apparently growing number of candidates that Trump is considering to be their chief ambassador to the world . They have recently included Corker , who supported Trump during the campaign ; former archrival Mitt Romney ; former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani ; former Utah governor Jon Huntsman , ex-U.N. ambassador John Bolton ; Exxon head Rex Tillerson ; and Sen. Joe Manchin ( D-W.Va. ) .
Many of those candidates are likely to break with Trump , including Corker , in a number of key foreign policy areas especially concerning Russia .
Since winning the election , Trump has tempered their rhetoric on NATO , to the extent that even outgoing President Obama said they were confident Trump would maintain U.S. obligations to the alliance after meeting with the president-elect .
The admission of Montenegro is likely to anger Russia , which has sought to pull the state off its course toward closer alliance with the West . This fall , Montenegrin authorities accused Moscow of trying to plot a botched coup during the country 's parliamentary elections .
That might not sit well with Trump , who has advocated warmer relations with Moscow , despite protestations from many within their own party that they and their aides are too close to Russian President Vladimir Putin .
Trump has not specifically weighed in on the prospect of Montenegro joining NATO . After a years-long application process , Montenegro 's pending membership was approved by members ' foreign ministers in May , and the White House asked Congress to ratify the agreement in June .
When they started the ratification process , Obama told Congress that accepting Montenegro into NATO ‚Äú will demonstrate to other countries in the Balkans and beyond that NATO 's door remains open ‚Äù to nations ready to carry out needed reforms , ‚Äú and is yet another milestone in advancing the Euro-Atlantic integration of the Balkans . ‚Äù
That idea wo n't sit well in Moscow , where Kremlin officials have long feared NATO encroachment , particularly in countries that used to be part of the Soviet Union or its sphere of influence during the Cold War . Bosnia and Herzegovina , Macedonia , and Georgia are also formally pursuing NATO membership , though none of their bids to join are imminent .
By itself , Montenegro offers few marked assets to the NATO alliance : the tiny country of just over 600,000 has a GDP of barely $ 7.5 billion and a standing military of only about 2,000 . But Montenegro 's main port , Bar , is strategically valuable as the only deep-sea port along Europe 's southern coast belonging to a non-member state .
Members of Congress also seem to care little about whether their move angers Russia .
‚Äú Strengthening and expanding NATO is critical at a time when terrorism and Russian aggression continue to threaten our European allies , ‚Äù Sen. Ron Johnson ( R-Wis. ) , who chairs the Senate Foreign Relations subcommittee that handles Europe and regional security , and co-sponsored the legislation with ranking member Sen. Jeanne Shaheen ( D-N.H. ) .
‚Äú Approving Montenegro 's accession will send the clear message that Congress will not bow to Russian threats and intimidation , ‚Äù Shaheen said . ‚Äú The United States must always stand on the side of freedom , security and democracy . ‚Äù
We all know Nick Saban can recruit .
Alabama 's record on the national stage speaks for itself . The most dominant program within the past decade , top-notch recruits from all across the country come in droves to Tuscaloosa ‚Äî in order to develop as football players , win at a very high level , and get a quality education .
When actually sitting down and analyzing how good Alabama 's current depth chart is , it 's downright scary .
The Belly of the Beast put together a full look at Alabama 's week one depth chart . However , it excluded the names and instead put the player 's star ranking coming from high school ( courtesy of the 247sports composite rankings ) .

Within Alabama 's two-deep alone , the Crimson Tide feature 18 former five-star prospects , and 28 former four-star prospects .
Suffice it to say , but Alabama is completely loaded heading into the 2016 season . As many have opined , ‚Äò it 's not about the X 's and O 's , but rather the Jimmy 's and Joe 's . '
Saban is undoubtedly operating under this axiom quite well .

MOBILE , Ala. - Hall of Famer Troy Aikman inflamed speculation this week that Washington quarterback Robert Griffin III could land with the Dallas Cowboys if the Redskins release them soon .
Aikman told SI.com that they believe either Cleveland quarterback Johnny Manziel or Griffin will be Tony Romo 's backup in 2016 .
Baylor coach Art Briles , who coached Griffin in college , said Thursday they could see the former Heisman Trophy winner fitting in with the Cowboys .
`` You could have a dream . That would probably be making it come true , '' Briles said from Senior Bowl practices . `` That would be a great place for him . It 's a great organization ; being back in Texas and with the Cowboys and having a chance to get in there under Romo for three years . Not that they need to sell tickets , but it would n't hurt ticket sales . ''
Briles was at the Senior Bowl to watch four of their Baylor players practice for the South team that will play Saturday against the North , which is being led by the Cowboys ' coaching staff . Briles and Baylor defensive coordinator Phil Bennett spent some time Thursday visiting with Pittsburgh Steelers coach Mike Tomlin .
The State Department Swamp was partially drained today . Secretary of State Tillerson fired Clinton 's rogue , self-described Shadow Government .
Making good on a Trump campaign promise , Secretary of State Rex Tillerson drained the Clinton swamp snakes , aka Obama administration holdovers . Thus the personnel responsible for the corrupt handling of Clinton 's emails and the Benghazi cover-up have left the building .
Lurking in the Shadows
In the Clinton State Department , a rogue shadow government existed in secret from the 7th floor . These policymakers publicly boasted about their secretive operations . And you can bet that some of them have been responsible for much of the transition angst experienced by the Trump administration . So Tillerson terminated them .
This is a dramatic move , as it signaled that policy will now be controlled by the White House , not professional diplomats . And not a moment too soon .
As we discovered during the campaign , the corruption among these Democrat government bureaucrats could poison an ocean .

For example , during EmailGate , according to The New Y ork Post Undersecretary Patrick Kennedy offered the FBI a quid pro quo to tamper with Clinton 's emails .
If the Bureau marked Clinton emails unclassified , an FBI summary reported , ‚Äú State would reciprocate by allowing the FBI to place more agents in countries where they were presently forbidden . ‚Äù
Kennedy attempted a blatant cover-up . They actually wanted the FBI to change U.S. policy so that it appeared Clinton had n't recklessly endangered America 's national security .
The Benghazi Traitors are Gone , Too .
Former Deputy Assistant Secretary Raymond Maxwell told the House Select Committee on Benghazi that they helped Hillary Clinton confidants ‚Äú separate ‚Äù damaging documents before releasing them to the Accountability Review Board . This board investigated the security lapses that caused the Sept. 11 , 2012 terrorist attacks on the U.S. embassy in Benghazi , Libya .
And according to the Independent Sentinel , Maxwell said the cover-up involved a weekend document session held in the basement of the State Department . During that weekend , they helped a ‚Äú State Department office director and top Clinton advisor ‚Äù sift through a room filled with boxed documents . Their orders were to purge those documents of anything implicating Clinton or their top advisers of wrongdoing regarding the Benghazi embassy 's security during the terror attack that killed four Americans .
As Maxwell testified :
‚Äú She told me , ‚Äò Ray , we are to go through these stacks and pull out anything that might put anybody in the [ Near Eastern Affairs ] front office or the seventh floor in a bad light , ' ‚Äú
Maxwell clarified that the ‚Äú seventh floor ‚Äù was State Department shorthand for then-Secretary of State Clinton and their principal advisers .
During this document purge , Clinton Chief of Staff Cheryl Mills and Deputy Chief of Staff Jake Sullivan allegedly entered the room and stayed for a while .
The four Americans killed in the Benghazi attacks were U.S . Ambassador Christopher Stevens , U.S. Foreign Service Information Management Officer Sean Smith , and CIA contractors Tyrone S. Woods and Glen Doherty . The State Department 's liberal deflection of accountability blamed an anti-Muslim YouTube video . This intentional lie disguised the Clinton State Department 's negligent disregard and apathetic incompetence towards the security of American officials working abroad . Mills was the face of that false video narrative .
You can bet that the Trump administration has begun looking for the enemies within . There were claims recently that the story leaked about using the National Guard for immigration roundups involved smoking on the snakes . We will certainly know more soon .
For now , Thanks to Mr. Tillerson the purge has begun .
D'Souza 's decision to stay humble and write for the critics helped make Illiberal Education a success , but their background and hard work helped too . Born in Mumbai in 1961 , D'Souza was a rare prodigy . They were a young , non-white , Ivy League-educated conservative immigrant arguing within the tradition of liberal education . Their criticisms of political correctness and multiculturalism could be not dismissed as the work of a has-been or crypto-racist . ‚Äú I especially empathize with minority students , who seek to discover principles of equality and justice that go considerably beyond the acquisition of vocational skill , ‚Äù they wrote in Illiberal Education .
Raised in a Catholic household and educated by Spanish Jesuits , D'Souza was also a Christian public intellectual of erudition and wisdom . They cited Simone Weil and Reinhold Niebuhr in their books as easily as they did Scripture . Their main criticism of the Reverend Jerry Falwell was the minister 's tendency to let their conservatism get the best of their Christianity . A passage from their first book , Falwell Before the Millennium : A Critical Biography , illuminates D'Souza 's own recent work :
In Reinhold Niebuhr 's words , ‚Äú Political controversies are always conflicts between sinners , and not between righteous men and sinners. ‚Äù Falwell is in the pulpit . The Bible speaks of good and evil , and in the Bible the two do not mix . But in politics , distinctions are often less vivid . Falwell 's rhetoric , however , frequently does not distinguish between liberals , socialists , and Communists . They sometimes regard their enemies as opposing not just their programs , but God Himself . So they demonize their critics the way they do him .
At 53 , D'Souza looks only slightly older than they did a generation ago . Their hair is graying at the temples and their face has gotten fuller . Their sympathies and work ethic have not changed much either . But they have expanded their range from author and public speaker to filmmaker , serving as a writer and director of both 2016 : Obama 's America and America : Imagine a World Without Them
They have also struck a series of road bumps . In October 2012 , D'Souza was forced to step down as president of King 's College in Manhattan after running afoul of the evangelical school 's sexual mores ; they divorced their wife of two decades ; and they pled guilty to using straw donors to aid the candidacy of Wendy Long , a friend who ran for the U.S. Senate in 2012 . In the eyes of progressives , those sins and crimes made D'Souza a moral hypocrite and phony . In the eyes of critics , they trot out straw men rather than concrete arguments . But both were symptoms rather than causes of their change intellectually ( and perhaps spiritually ) from a generation ago . D'Souza has not so much broken bad as fallen victim to pride .
‚Äú It was my very first book , ‚Äù D'Souza said recently of Illiberal Education , smiling nostalgically at the thought of the critical and financial success it received . Except it was n't . In addition to the Falwell book , they had written a book on the great works of the Catholic intellectual tradition and co-edited another that boasted an introduction from no less a Republican titan than Richard M. Nixon . The chronological order of the books does not matter , but D'Souza 's belief that Illiberal Education was their first is a window into their mind . They are more than an author . Their books have massive appeal to Fox News viewers ; they refer to the ones that did not as their ‚Äú pre-books. ‚Äù Whatever the view of their critics on the left or right‚Äîand in the last five years nearly all have heaped scorn on The Roots of Obama 's Rage and Obama 's America‚Äîhe plays to the crowd . ‚Äú The book industry was changing after Illiberal Education , and I found out you could make money by not writing for the critics , that book reviews did n't matter , ‚Äù D'Souza said .
It 's been nearly two weeks since a scandal shook many people 's faith in the scientists behind global warming alarmism . The scandal forced the University of East Anglia ( UK ) to divulge that it threw away raw temperature data and prompted the temporary resignation of Phil Jones of the university 's Climate Research Unit .
Despite that resignation and calls by a U.S. senator to investigate the matter , ABC , CBS and NBC morning and evening news programming has remained silent - not mentioning a word about the scandal since it broke on Nov. 20 , even as world leaders including President Barack Obama prepare to meet in Copenhagen , Denmark next week to promote a pact to reduce greenhouse gases .
MRC 's President Brent Bozell called the networks ' silence a `` cover-up '' Dec. 2 .
Other news outlets , including The New York Times , Washington Post , CNN and Associated Press have deemed ClimateGate worthy of reporting , but the networks were too busy reporting on celebrity car accidents and the killer whale that ate a great white shark . Instead of airing a broadcast news segment that might inform the public about the science scandal , both ABC and CBS relegated the story to their Web sites . There was one mention of the scandal on ABC 's Sunday talk show : `` This Week with George Stephanopoulos . ''
The ClimateGate scandal , as it is being called , has the hallmarks of a major news story : private emails purporting to show unethical or illegal behavior supplied by a hacker or whistleblower , high profile scientists like James Hansen and Michael Mann , and a potential conspiracy to distort science for political gain . But the networks have n't bothered with the story .
Patrick J. Michaels , a climatologist and BMI adviser , said Nov. 20 of the leaked e-mails and documents : `` This is n't a smoking gun , it 's a mushroom cloud . ''
White House press secretary Robert Gibbs responded to a question about ClimateGate by insisting that `` global warming is happening '' and that for most people it is n't really a question anymore . That is the same message viewers get from the network news about climate change .
An examination of morning and evening news programs on ABC , CBS and NBC since Nov. 20 yielded zero mentions of the scandal , even in the Nov. 25 reports about Obama going to Copenhagen to discuss the need for emissions reductions . But during the same time period , the networks reported on pro-golfer Tiger Woods ' `` minor '' car accident at least 37 times . They also found time to report on an orphaned Moose and the meal selection at the president 's State Dinner .
ClimateGate began after someone ( hacker or whistleblower ) attacked servers of University of East Anglia 's Climate Research Unit ( CRU ) and made thousands of e-mails and documents public . Those e-mails appear to show a conspiracy to falsify temperature data , a willingness to destroy information rather than release it under Freedom of Information ( FOI ) law and the intimidation of publications willing to publish skeptical articles .
CRU 's director Phil Jones admitted real CRU e-mails had been stolen when they told New Zealand 's Investigate magazine , `` It was a hacker . We were aware of this about three or four days ago that someone had hacked into our system and taken and copied loads of data files and emails . '' Others argue a whistleblower was responsible for the breach .
One of those alleged e-mails was from Jones to Michael Mann ( famous for their hockey stick graph of global warming ) and two others appeared to indicate manipulation of scientific data .
Jones wrote : `` I 've just completed Mike 's Nature trick of adding in the real temps to each series for the last 20 years ( ie from 1981 onwards ) amd [ Sic ] from 1961 for Keith 's to hide the decline . ''
Jones , who contributed to a chapter of the U.N. 's IPCC report , claims the term `` trick '' was used `` colloquially as in a clever thing to do . '' Myron Ebell , Director of Global Warming Policy for the Competitive Enterprise Institute ( CEI ) , supplied their own view of what Jones and Mann meant by hiding the decline .
Ebell wrote in the National Post : `` What is the clever method that Prof. Jones learned from Prof. Mann ? I think they are referring to the way Prof. Mann constructed their celebrated hockey stick graph . Their proxy records showed flat temperatures for the past 1,000 years , including the past century . But everyone knows that temperatures have gone up rapidly in the past few decades ... So what Prof. Mann did was splice the last few decades of surface temperature records onto their proxy record . Voila ! - the hockey stick . ''
The alleged e-mails were enough to force Jones ' temporary resignation . On Dec. 1 , Associated Press reported that Jones is `` stepping down pending an investigation into allegations that they overstated the case for human-made climate change . ''
Other leaked e-mails asked people to delete e-mails and one said that if information was requested using FOI , it would be deleted rather than turned over :
Alleged e-mail from Jones to Mann Feb. 2 , 2005 :
`` The two MMs have been after the CRU station data for years . If they ever hear there is Freedom of Information Act now in the UK , I think I 'll delete the file rather than send to anyone . Does your similar act in the US force you to respond to enquiries within 20 days ? - our does ! The UK works on precedents , so the first request will test it . We also have a data protection act , which I will hide behind . ''
In Britain , it is a crime to delete information requested under FOI .

I tried to love Amazon 's amazing e-ink electronic book reader , the Kindle , I really did . But I wanted a device that had full color and a higher-resolution display and that did n't limit the content you can view on it . So instead of shelling out $ 300 , I decided to make my own version using a tablet PC -- basically a computer with a stowable keyboard ( or no keyboard at all ) that you mainly control with a stylus and touchscreen .
It does n't have the long battery life or always-on connection for downloading books and magazines that the Kindle offers , but with a few system tweaks and the addition of some free software , it does everything else the Kindle does . Plus , unlike Amazon 's gadget , it lets me read any comic book or magazine in color , and does n't require an extra fee to read blogs and download PDFs . And since tablets never quite caught on with consumers , they 're available by the truckload on eBay for about half the cost of a Kindle .

The use of sacramental wine may be one reason that wine consumption is so high per capita in Vatican City . iStockphoto/ Thinkstock
According to Trade Data and Analysis , the 932 residents of Vatican City consumed more than 70 liters ( 18.5 gallons ) of wine per capita in 2009 , followed by Luxembourg , whose 500,000 residents drank 54 liters ( 14.3 gallons ) per capita .
Granted , the low populations of these countries push those ratios higher . And it 's fair to say that no children live within the borders of Vatican City . But there are smaller countries such as Andorra and the Cayman Islands who come in lower on that list .
So what 's the deal ? Remember that the sacramental wine is a cornerstone of ceremony in the Catholic Church . With that in mind , if Vatican City ever dropped out of first place , that would be the bigger story .
Pantech
Samsung has inked a deal with fellow Korean phone maker Pantech for an equity stake in the company .
In a statement on Wednesday , Samsung confirmed an earlier report from Yonhap News , saying that it has acquired a 10 percent stake in Pantech for $ 48 million . The company said that the investment is designed solely to enhance the relationship between the firms .
As expected , the move has raised some eyebrows in Korea , where Samsung and Pantech are competing most heavily in the mobile device market . Elsewhere around the world , Pantech 's devices are decidedly second- or third-tier and do n't amount to much competition for Samsung .
In a statement to The Next Web , however , Samsung shied away from talk of its competition with Pantech , saying instead that the deal really has more to do with the internal mobile components it sells to Pantech for the company 's devices .
With the investment , Samsung is now the third-largest shareholder in Pantech behind Qualcomm and Korea Development Bank .
CINCINNATI -- It appears Vontaze Burfict will be out a fourth straight game as the linebacker missed the Cincinnati Bengals ' Thanksgiving Day practice .
Coach Marvin Lewis said Wednesday that although Burfict would n't practice that day , there was a good chance they would return to practice at some point this week . With their game on the road Sunday at the Tampa Bay Buccaneers , the Bengals only have one practice left this week : Friday 's .
If Burfict goes Friday , do n't view it as a sign they will be ready for Sunday . View it instead as a sign that they might be ready in time for next week 's home game against the Steelers .
Since last Wednesday , Burfict had been spending practice time rehabbing and going through conditioning drills on the side as they work their way back from arthroscopic knee surgery . They had the procedure done Nov. 3 , a day after they tweaked their knee while trying to shed a block against the Jacksonville Jaguars . They finished that game . The knee injury has just been the latest in a series of ailments for the linebacker this season . They had head and neck issues in three of the first four games they played this season .
Burfict , one year removed from a Pro Bowl second season , has only finished three games this season .
Along with Burfict , the Bengals were again without defensive end Margus Hunt and a pair of players who were fighting off illnesses . Linebacker Nico Johnson and receiver Greg Little were the third and fourth players to miss practice this week because of illnesses . Receiver Mohamed Sanu and long snapper Clark Harris also missed Wednesday 's practice because of sicknesses , but returned Thursday .
Cornerback Adam Jones , who was n't even at the facility Wednesday , practiced fully Thursday . According to the injury report , they had been out with non-injury related tooth issue .
Here 's the full Thursday injury report :
DID NOT PRACTICE
LB Burfict ( knee )
DE Hunt ( ankle )
LB Johnson ( illness ; non-injury related )
LS Little ( illness ; non-injury related )
OT Andrew Whitworth ( veteran 's day off )

CHICAGO -- You can chalk it up to just another Jay Cutler mistake against the Green Bay Packers , but that just might underrate the importance of Clay Matthews as an inside linebacker .
With Matthews in coverage more often than they rushed in Sunday 's 31-23 win at Soldier Field , their fourth-quarter interception killed any chance of a Chicago Bears comeback .
The Packers have picked off Cutler at least once every time they have started against them since they joined the Bears in 2009 , and it was their 22nd interception against the Packers in 12 career regular-season games .
Matthews may still prefer to impact games as a pass-rusher , but plays like that show why the Packers need them in the middle , too .
Like they had been a middle linebacker their entire career , Matthews dropped into coverage against tight end Martellus Bennett , who never had a chance at Cutler 's pass that Matthews tracked the entire way . When asked what their responsibility was on that play , Matthews , while trying to keep a straight face , said : `` Get an interception . Drop into coverage . Make a pick . Be the hero . ''
It does n't appear Matthews will return to their old role as an outside linebacker any time soon , especially after fellow inside linebacker Sam Barrington dropped out of Sunday 's game because of an ankle injury and was replaced by the inexperienced Nate Palmer .
Matthews may not have helped the Packers ' run defense , which was the impetus for their move inside last season , given that Matt Forte rushed for 141 yards and a touchdown on 24 carries , but they made up for it just when the Packers needed it most . The Bears were well inside Packers ' territory , at their 29-yard line , when Matthews picked off Cutler .
`` I thought that play changed the game , '' Packers coach Mike McCarthy said .
LG 's talking a big game about the quality of the LG G4 's camera , and in the time we 've been playing with it , it 's certainly produced some impressive images . But it 's also up against some impressive competition ‚Äî smartphone cameras have never been better than they are today , and today they 're really good . So we 're pitting the LG G4 against the competition , namely the iPhone 6 and the Samsung Galaxy S6 .
Below you 'll find a gallery of photos taken with the LG G4 , Samsung Galaxy S6 , and the iPhone 6 . None have been retouched ‚Äî the only alteration you 'll see is for size . All used the default camera app , and when shooting in auto mode all had Auto HDR enabled ( `` High Dynamic Range '' HDR combines an over-exposed , properly-exposed , and under-exposed image into one to bring out details in the darks and lights that a single exposure can not capture ) . For several of the night shots we did use Pro mode on the Galaxy S6 and Manual Mode on the G4 .
Sensor size and pixel size are the literal physical sizes of the light-sensing instruments behind the lens ; a larger sensor can collect more light , and the larger the number , the larger the sensor . The sensor is where the resolution comes into the real world : that grid of millions of pixels has to be crammed onto that little plate . The more pixels you put on there , the smaller each pixel has to be . A larger pixel can collect more light , and thus can shoot handle low-light situations better . Conversely , a larger sensor can fit more pixels without sacrificing pixel size .
A few notes on those raw numbers : the megapixel counts and resolutions only affect how large the image is , though larger images do zoom better . It 's the focal length that determines how wide of a field is captured , and there the lower the number the wider the image ( right around 28-30mm is the sweet spot for smartphone photography ) . The smaller the aperture number , the more light is let into the camera . A smaller aperture number also means a narrower depth of field ‚Äî when taking a photo with a subject that 's close to the lens , things that are further away will be blurred .
But before we get to the photos , let 's talk about these cameras for a bit . We picked these phones because they 're both the two best-selling smartphones out there , and also the two that LG 's explicitly targeting on almost all fronts with the G4 . On paper the G4 and Galaxy S6 seem like they 'd be close competitors , while the iPhone 6 seems like it should be hilariously outmatched . Here 's what things look like on paper :
It 's a very close race between all three phones , and it was an interesting shooting experience using all three like this . When it comes to the interfaces , LG and Samsung have both caught up with Apple in ease of use when in straight auto mode : just point your camera at your subject , hit the shutter button , and 99.9 % of the time you 'll be satisfied with the result . The lack of a manual ( or manual-ish ) mode on the iPhone is most of the time not an issue , but there are times we would really want the option .
The iPhone 6 suffers with night shots , but makes up for it with great true-to-life photos .
The only spots where the iPhone 6 truly suffers are in rough nighttime photography ( the iPhone 6 Plus has OIS , but the smaller iPhone 6 does not ) , the 100 % crop ( you ca n't zoom in as far and maintain detail ) , and in the width of the panorama . But for being a camera with a smaller sensor than the G4 and half the pixels to work with in comparison to the G4 and the Galaxy S6 , it holds its own quite well with quality optics , excellent processing , and photos that looked truer to life , if frequently darker .
The Galaxy S6 's ease of access ‚Äî just double tap the home button to launch the camera , even from off ‚Äî made for an enjoyable experience . The camera was always fast to launch and capture , though there was often a bit of annoying lag between photos if you wanted to shoot rapidly ( but not on burst mode ) . The Galaxy S6 was a solid performer throughout . Our only real complaint comes in comparison to the LG G4 , which offered a full manual mode with shutter speed adjustments that the Galaxy S6 currently does not .
The LG G4 focuses fast , takes sharp photos , and has a color spectrum sensor that tries to compensate to make photos that look more like how our eyes see .
The LG G4 offers two things the iPhone 6 and Galaxy S6 do not : laser auto focus and a color spectrum sensor . The laser auto focus uses , well , a laser to guide the auto focus system , bouncing an infrared beam off the scene to provide for sharper and faster focusing . The color spectrum sensor , on the other hand , measures the overall color of the light in the scene and attempts to adjust the image to compensate . Think of a space lit with an old yellow light ‚Äî most cameras would produce a yellow-tinted photo , while the G4 would recognize that the lighting was yellow and adjust the image to produce something closer to what we saw with our eyes ( our brains are generally very good at handling and adjusting for colored light ) .
Overall the G4 produced photos that were notably sharper than the Galaxy S6 or iPhone 6 . When it came to nighttime photos shot in auto mode , the G4 tended to go brighter as well , often to the point of blowing out bright spots and adding too much detail to things like a hazy night sky . Daylight photos from the G4 were also generally brighter , but usually not to the detriment of the overall image . The G4 also had trouble focusing during our nighttime panoramas , but yet had no issue with standard nighttime photos .
So which one 's the best ?
In the vast majority of situations , you wo n't be disappointed with any of these three cameras . It 's only when you want to zoom or play with manual controls that the iPhone 's weaknesses come forth . Both the Galaxy S6 and the LG G4 perform admirably in nearly all situations , but sometimes it feels like the G4 's color spectrum sensor is trying to compensate for lighting issues that are n't present ‚Äî many of our nighttime city shots had a distinctly yellow cast to them that was n't quite there in real life or with the other two competitors . But if you want comprehensive manual controls and the ability to shoot in RAW , you ca n't go wrong with the G4 .
LG G4 , iPhone 6 , Samsung Galaxy S6 ‚Äî you wo n't be disappointed with the camera on any of these phones .
There 's one last thing to be said here : you ca n't make a comparison between the photographic capabilities of these devices until you 're viewing them on the same display . Each has their own display technology : IPS LCD on the iPhone 6 , IPS Quantum LCD on the LG G4 , and Super AMOLED on the Galaxy S6 . Each display offers a different viewing experience , with varying accuracies of brightness , contrast , and color saturation . LG claims that the DCI specification to which the LG G4 is held is more accurate , but that makes comparing a photo taken with a different phone side-by-side impossible until they 're on the same display ( we used a calibrated AOC monitor and a calibrated Retina MacBook Pro display for our comparisons ) .
If we had to pick one winner out of all of these , it 'd be the Samsung Galaxy S6 , with the LG G4 coming in a close second . And to be honest , the iPhone 6 is n't far behind that . They 're all excellent cameras attached to good smartphones . LG , Samsung , and Apple all have put a focus on the quality of the images their cameras produce , and it really shows . You wo n't be disappointed by any , but the straightforward ease of use and reliable image quality of the Galaxy S6 were just enough to push it past the all-around amazing LG G4 camera .
Image caption The scarves were removed from the sheep and shepherd on Thursday
Mystery surrounds the removal of scarves that were placed around the necks of fake green sheep .
The plastic flock was first installed on a roundabout on the A283 in Shoreham-by-Sea in November 2011 to promote the South Downs National Park .
The animals were then removed by the county council after motorists thought they were real , but were reinstated on Tuesday with a life-sized shepherd .
A business person put scarves on them , which were taken off 24 hours later .
West Sussex County Council said local artist Danny McBride was commissioned to design the steel shepherd to make it clear the sheep were not real .
Paul Richards , director of Sussex Marine Watersports , said they put the scarves on them on Wednesday to `` put a smile on people 's faces '' .
When it gets to summer , I 've got some sunglasses ready to put on them Paul Richards
They said the garments could not have blown off since they had been tied on .
The animals ' return was `` good news '' for the town , Mr Richards added .
`` If it gets people talking about Shoreham - we 're halfway between Brighton and Worthing - then it 's a good thing , '' they said .
Mr Richards said they had also put Christmas hats on the sheep in December 2011 .
`` When it gets to summer , I 've got some sunglasses ready to put on them , '' they added .

The United States National Reconnaissance Office is an intelligence agency tasked with the design , construction and operation of all U.S. reconnaissance satellites and delivers satellite intelligence to other intelligence agencies including signals intelligence for the NSA , image reconnaissance data to the NGA and measurement & signature intelligence to the DIA . Established in 1961 , the NRO has been shrouded in great secrecy and its existence as an agency was only first acknowledged in the early 1990s .
As an intelligence agency , the NRO goes through great lengths to keep its activities secret , therefore the identity of all NRO satellites is classified . However , it is possible to identify the nature of satellites taking into account their launch site , launch window , launch vehicle type and ascent path . Sometimes , hints can be found in mission logos and , after launch , most satellites are typically tracked in orbit by a worldwide network of observers , revealing from where they operate , and often what they are tasked with .
Some cases are easier to solve while other NRO missions can only be narrowed down to a number of candidates . NROL-76 is a harder nut to crack for a number of reasons outlined below .
The NROL-76 launch contract with SpaceX was first revealed by the NRO in 2016 , but was awarded as early as mid-2012 or 13 according to comments made by NRO officials . At that point , SpaceX was in the midst of its transition from the Falcon 9 v1.0 to the much-improved v1.1 version . NROL-76 was most likely sized for the v1.1 version of Falcon 9 , providing an upper limit of 4,850kg if headed to GTO and 10,890kg if headed to LEO based on the rocket 's performance numbers .
The most valuable clue for this mission is found in the launch hazard areas that reveal the orbital inclination this mission is headed to . Two safety areas have been identified through the typical NOTAMs ( Notices to Airmen and Mariners ) , the first corresponding to the direct launch corridor out of Kennedy Space Center and another south east of South Africa , likely corresponding to the deorbit of the second stage .
To deliver NROL-76 , Falcon 9 will depart Florida to the north-east ‚Äì ruling out a Geostationary Mission . Still in play are a LEO Mission and a highly-elliptical Molniya Orbit that is used for reconnaissance and communications assets that need to cover the high-latitude regions in the north .
It has been disclosed that the NROL-76 mission would feature a first stage RTLS ( Return to Launch Site ) for recovery , indicating Falcon 9 has plenty of performance margin , either carrying a very light payload or targeting a low-energy orbit ( or a combination of the two ) . Performance wise , Falcon 9 FT could deliver 2,300 Kilograms into a Molniya Transfer Orbit and still manage an RTLS landing while LEO capability with RTLS is on the order of 10.5 metric tons . This still leaves a number of options on the table .
Molniya Orbit is a characteristic orbit named after the Soviet/Russian Molniya communications satellites that used this type of orbit since the 1960s to optimize coverage for Russia 's high-latitude regions . Molniya Orbits are characterized by a period of half a sidereal day ( 11 hrs & 56 min ) and an inclination of 63.4 or 116.6 degrees which allows a satellite to have a constant argument of perigee and avoid perturbations by the gravitational field of Earth . Relative to Earth , the satellite 's speed is slowest at higher altitudes , meaning that the spacecraft spends the majority of its time around apogee , i.e . the northern hemisphere .
Typically , Molniya orbits are used for communications in the high-latitude regions , meteorology satellites and missile-warning satellites tasked with covering the northern sector that can not be easily viewed from Geostationary Orbit . If indeed heading for Molniya Orbit , NROL-76 , in all likelihood , is a member of the fourth generation of the Satellite Data System ( SDS ) .
SDS , also known under the code name Quasar , operates relay satellites in Geostationary and Molniya Orbits to provide real-time downlink of imagery from low-orbiting reconnaissance satellites , notably the Keyhole electro-optical reconnaissance satellites and Lacrosse/Topaz radar assets . The SDS constellation typically consisted of at least two satellites in Geostationary Orbit and three in Molniya Orbits at the proper spacing to allow each to be over the northern hemisphere for eight hours to create 24/7 coverage .
The first generation of SDS began deployment in 1976 and saw seven launches through 1987 , employing 630-Kilogram satellites that offered twelve channels for UHF communications . The SDS-2 satellites , four of which were launched between 1989 and 1996 , were more massive with a launch mass of 2.3 metric tons and the addition of K-Band downlink capability . SDS-3 debuted in 1998 and used Atlas V and Delta IV launch vehicles to lift eight satellites through the year 2014 .
The first SDS-4 satellite is rumored to be the NROL-61 payload ( USA-269 ) launched in July 2016 and taking up residence in Geostationary Orbit . The last SDS satellite launched into Molniya Orbit was NROL-24 in 2007 , causing speculation that SDS may be transitioning to a purely GEO-based system .
If the Molniya Segment of the constellation is to be continued , a replacement for one of the aging satellites would have to go up soon as previous SDS satellites have shown a nominal replacement rate of around a decade .
The SDS satellites were reportedly manufactured by Hughes Space & Communications , now part of Boeing 's Satellite Development Center . The latest Geostationary SDS satellite used the Atlas V 421 launch vehicles , indicating a mass of slightly over five metric tons consistent with Boeing 's BSS-702HP high-power satellite bus suitable for powerful communications satellites .
NROL-76 , if indeed headed to Molniya orbit , could not use the 702HP version and would instead have to use the 702SP all-electric satellite that comes with a launch mass between 1,900 and 2,300 Kilograms ( right in the performance range for Falcon 9 with RTLS ) .
Boeing received three orders from the U.S. Government in 2013 for 702SP satellites with no information on the programs these satellites would belong to . The procurement of SpaceX 's Falcon 9 for the NROL-76 mission coincides with the timing of the Boeing order , adding merit to this being an SDS satellite . In a contrary statement , the NRO said NROL-76 was ‚Äò designed , built and operated ' by the NRO itself ‚Äì however , this phrase has been used in the past when generally describing the NRO 's tasks .
The palette of LEO missions for NROL-76 is much larger than for the highly specialized Molniya Orbit . However , some options such as planar missions and existing NRO constellations can be ruled out because the launch time for NROL-76 was not affected by the two-week delay from a mid- to a late April 2017 launch . Planar windows shift by several minutes per day as would constellation missions , indicating NROL-76 ‚Äì if headed to LEO ‚Äì is likely a one-off or experimental mission targeting a non-synchronous orbit .
According to official NRO information , the agency did not directly book a ride with SpaceX but contracted with Ball Aerospace which then secured the Falcon 9 launch vehicle . This is indicative of a ‚Äò delivery in orbit ' type of contract which would make Ball Aerospace the manufacturer of the NROL-76 satellite .
To date , Ball Aerospace has built a reputation for optical instrumentation carried by Earth-orbiting satellites and interplanetary spacecraft , as well as a number of smalls- and medium-class satellites . The largest satellite platform offered by Ball Aerospace is the BCP-5000 that can carry sizeable payloads and has been optimized for Earth-observation missions . BCP-4000 is similarly massive , but optimized for Synthetic Aperture Radar instruments .
WorldView-3 is the biggest satellite manufactured by Ball , weighing in at 2,800 Kilograms . NROL-76 is likely in a similar mass range , giving Falcon 9 plenty of excess performance for the first stage return to Landing Zone-1 and the second stage deorbit maneuver .
One option , raised by satellite tracking expert Ted Molczan , is NROL-76 as a replacement for USA-193 that launched as NROL-21 atop a Delta II rocket in December 2006 . The radar reconnaissance satellite entered an orbit of 350 by 365 Kilometers , 58.5¬∞ but failed shortly after launch .
By February 2008 , the satellite had decayed to 242 by 257 Kilometers and plans were set in motion to purposefully destroy the spacecraft to dissipate over 450kg of hazardous propellant and prevent pieces that could survive re-entry from reaching the ground .
USA-193 was intercepted by an SM-3 missile on February 21 , 2008 which successfully destroyed the 2,300-Kilogram craft into 174 trackable debris most of which re-entered within a few days of the event while others lingered in orbit for another year and a half .
It is questionable whether the framework under which USA-193 was created is still in existence . The mission was developed under the NRO 's Future Imagery Architecture that began in 1997 with the goal of consolidating electro-optical and radar reconnaissance programs to reduce cost through the use of common satellite systems .
Boeing was awarded the contract for FIA in 1999 , but by 2005 , the program had suffered a cost overrun of around $ 5 billion , leading to the cancellation of the FIA program with electro-optical satellite production going back to Lockheed Martin and Boeing progressing with the radar satellites proposed under FIA .
It is also doubtful that a satellite re-flight mission would need eight to ten years for development if there is serious interest in the mission .
The NROL-76 payload patch may include hints to the satellite 's task , showing two explorers ( possibly Lewis & Clark ) , one peering into the distance with a telescope while the other holds a rifle . The words ‚Äò Explore ‚Äì Discover ‚Äì Know ' are depicted on the patch as well as six smaller and a single larger & brighter star .
From the patch , one could conclude that NROL-76 will serve as a reconnaissance or technology demonstration satellite , possibly exploring the use of a new type of sensor or wavelength band . Because the satellite is not targeting a synchronous orbit , the instrument is likely suitable for day-and-night data collection .
The LEO options appears to be the more likely when looking at Falcon 9 's flight timeline that suggests an extremely lofted trajectory as seen only in previous LEO missions executed by the vehicle with a steep climb on the first stage and the initial portion of the second stage to reach the desired altitude ahead of leveling off to build speed and reach a nearly circular orbit .
Satellite trackers around the globe will be at the ready to spot NROL-76 in its classified orbit in the days and weeks after its launch . Once knowing the orbit of the satellite , trackers will monitor for potential maneuvering and changes in the satellite 's brightness which could reveal deployment events of large appendages such as antennas .

Amy Wax is a tenured professor at the U. of Pennsylvania School of Law with a knack for low key crimethink . ( Here 's Prof. Wax 's recent article on ‚Äú Educating the Disadvantaged ‚Äù in National Affairs . ) Now many of their colleagues are out to get her , although they ca n't seem to think of any reasons for why what they say is wrong , just that it makes them so angry . Professor Wax is obviously guilty of hate because they all hate them
By 33 Penn Law Faculty Members 08/30/17 6:31pm
To the University of Pennsylvania Community :
We write to condemn recent statements our colleague Amy Wax , the Robert Mundheim Professor of Law at Penn Law School , has made in popular media pieces .
In an op-ed published recently at Philly.com , Wax and a coauthor wrote that ‚Äú All cultures are not equal , ‚Äù going on to claim that various social problems would be ‚Äú significantly reduce [ d ] ‚Äù if ‚Äú the academics , media , and Hollywood ‚Äù would stop the ‚Äú preening pretense of defending the downtrodden , ‚Äù because that would lead to ‚Äú restoring the hegemony of the bourgeois culture. ‚Äù In an interview with The Daily Pennsylvanian about the op-ed , Wax was quoted as saying that ‚Äú Everyone wants to go to countries ruled by white Europeans , ‚Äù because , in the phrasing of the DP article 's author , ‚Äú Anglo-Protestant cultural norms are superior. ‚Äù ‚Ä¶
We categorically reject Wax 's claims .
We believe the ideal of equal opportunity to succeed in education is best achieved by a combination of academic freedom , open debate and a commitment by all participants to respect one another without bias or stereotype . To our students , we say the following : If your experience at Penn Law falls substantially short of this ideal , something has gone wrong , and we want to know about it .
AUBURN , Ala. -- Chris Denson scored 18 points and Auburn made six straight free throws over the final 34 seconds in a 74-67 victory over Georgia on Saturday .
The Tigers ( 10-9 , 2-6 Southeastern Conference ) went 11 of 13 from the foul line over the final five minutes to secure their second straight SEC win after dropping 16 in a row .
Auburn had five players score in double figures for the first time in an SEC game since Feb. 20 , 2010 , against Arkansas .
Denson and KT Harrell , the SEC 's top scoring duo , took turns offensively . Denson had 14 in the second half .
Harrell scored 13 of their 16 points in the first half and made three 3-pointers . Freshman Tahj Shamsid-Deen , a Georgia native , finished with 12 points and four assists while Asauhn Dixon-Tatum and Allen Payne scored 10 apiece .
Dixon-Tatum also had eight rebounds and four blocked shots .
Charles Mann scored 18 points and Nemanja Djurisic had 11 for the Bulldogs ( 10-10 , 4-4 ) , who have dropped three straight games .
Georgia 's No . 2 scorer , Kenny Gaines , returned after missing the last two games with a bruised left thigh . They scored nine points on 2-of-10 shooting but picked up their fourth foul with 8:38 left .
Mann scored on two quick drives to bring Georgia back to within three twice over the final 1:08 .
The Bulldogs had to keep sending Auburn to the line , though .
Payne , Shamsid-Deen and Dixon-Tatum all hit a pair of free throws down the stretch .
The Tigers had n't won back-to-back league games since opening 2-0 last season .
The Bulldogs trailed by as many as 13 points in the second half but pulled to within 59-57 with 5:40 left .
J.J. Frazier came up with two big plays to cap a 15-4 run . They stole the ball from a driving Shamsid-Deen , drove and dished to Djurisic , who hit a layup and subsequent free throw .
Then Frazier buried a 3-pointer from the right corner .
Auburn scored seven of the next eight points .
Shamsid-Deen , who is from Decatur , Ga. , said Friday that they are n't recruited by the Bulldogs because they deemed them too small .
They left the game for several minutes in the first half with a twisted right ankle but still played a big role .
The threat of government action is making the pharmaceutical industry nervous . A big sell-off in biotechnology stocks over the last two weeks helped wipe out the sector 's gains for the entire year . Valeant 's stock has been among the hardest hit , losing about a quarter of its value since Sept. 18 . Still , the stock is trading for about six times as much as it was five years ago , a meteoric rise that far outpaced most drug companies .
Valeant defended itself , saying in a statement that it ‚Äú prices its treatments based on a range of factors , including clinical benefits and the value they bring to patients , physicians , payers and society. ‚Äù It says patients are largely shielded from price increases by insurance and financial assistance programs the company offers , so that virtually no one is denied a drug they need .
But Mr. Pearson , a former McKinsey & Company consultant , has said they have a duty to shareholders to wring the maximum profit out of each drug . And in some cases old neglected drugs sell for far less than newer drugs for the same diseases .
If ‚Äú products are sort of mispriced and there 's an opportunity , we will act appropriately in terms of doing what I assume our shareholders would like us to do , ‚Äù they told analysts in a conference call in April .
Valeant is an extreme example of practices that have been around in the pharmaceutical industry for years . The United States , unlike most countries , does not control drug prices , and pharmaceutical manufacturers have relied heavily on steady and sometimes outsize price increases in this country to bolster their revenue and profits .
Valeant is known for buying companies and laying off their employees to achieve savings , while accumulating a debt of about $ 30 billion . It spends an amount equivalent to only 3 percent of its sales on research and development , which it views as risky and inefficient compared with buying existing drugs . Traditional big drug companies spend 15 to 20 percent of sales on research and development . Valeant also pays extremely low taxes because it is officially based in Canada , although Mr. Pearson operates from New Jersey .
Price increases provide an extra boost to the company 's sales and profits .
For example , after Valeant acquired Salix Pharmaceuticals this year , it raised the price of one Salix drug , the diabetes pill Glumetza , about 800 percent .

The existence of such a derivation indicates that there are striking connections between well-established physics and pure mathematics 9 A thermodynamic proof of the inequality between arithmetic and geometric mean , ‚Äù Phys .

A , 1 ( 1978 ) . https : //doi.org/10.1016/0375-9601 ( 78 ) 90548-0 It is the purpose of this paper to show that this formula can in fact be derived from a variational computation of theof the hydrogen atom . The existence of such a derivation indicates that there are striking connections between well-established physics and pure mathematicsthat are remarkably beautiful yet still to be discovered .
equation for the hydrogen atom is given by H œà = ‚àí ƒß 2 2 m ‚àá 2 ‚àí e 2 r œà = E œà , with the corresponding radial equation obtained by separation of variables being H ( r ) R ( r ) = ‚àí ƒß 2 2 m d 2 d r 2 + 2 r d d r ‚àí ‚Ñì ( ‚Ñì + 1 ) r 2 ‚àí e 2 r R ( r ) = E R ( r ) . Using the trial wave function œà Œ± ‚Ñì m = r ‚Ñì e ‚àí Œ± r 2 Y ‚Ñì m ( Œ∏ , œï ) , ( 2 ) where Œ± > 0 is a real parameter and the Y ‚Ñì m ( Œ∏ , œï ) are the usual spherical harmonics , the expectation value of the Hamiltonian is found to be given by „Äà H „Äâ Œ± ‚Ñì ‚â° œà Œ± ‚Ñì m H ( r ) œà Œ± ‚Ñì m „Äà œà Œ± ‚Ñì m | œà Œ± ‚Ñì m „Äâ = ƒß 2 2 m ‚Ñì + 3 2 2 Œ± ‚àí e 2 Œì ( ‚Ñì + 1 ) Œì ( ‚Ñì + 3 2 ) 2 Œ± . As a consequence of the Y ‚Ñì m ( Œ∏ , œï ) in Eq . œà Œ±‚Ñìm is orthogonal to any energy and angular momentum eigenstate that has a value for angular momentum different from ‚Ñì . Therefore the minimization of „ÄàH„Äâ Œ± with respect to Œ± , namely „Äà H „Äâ m i n ‚Ñì = ‚àí m e 4 2 ƒß 2 1 ( ‚Ñì + 3 2 ) Œì ( ‚Ñì + 1 ) Œì ( ‚Ñì + 3 2 ) 2 , ( 3 ) gives an upper bound for the lowest energy state with the given value of ‚Ñì . The Schr√∂dingerfor the hydrogen atom is given bywith the corresponding radialobtained by separation of variables beingUsing the trialwhere > 0 is a real parameter and theare the usual spherical harmonics , the expectation value of the Hamiltonian is found to be given byAs a consequence of thein Eq .

Therefore the minimization of „Äàwith respect to , namelygives an upper bound for the loweststate with the given value of ‚Ñì .

For example , the ratio is 0.849 , 0.906 , 0.932 , 0.978 , 0.998 for ‚Ñì = 0 , 1 , 2 , 10 , 100. solution and the exact result correspond to strictly circular orbits . The circularity of the trial solution orbits at large ‚Ñì is a consequence of the fact that the uncertainty in r2 , measured in units of mean square radius , is given by [ „Äà r 4 „Äâ Œ± ‚Ñì ‚àí ( „Äà r 2 „Äâ Œ± ‚Ñì ) 2 ] 1 2 „Äà r 2 „Äâ Œ± ‚Ñì = ‚Ñì + 3 2 ‚àí 1 2 , which approaches 0 at large ‚Ñì . Both the trial solution orbits and the exact orbits are then identical to those of the Bohr model in the large ‚Ñì limit , as expected from Bohr 's correspondence principle . The well-known exact result for thelevels of hydrogen iswhere= 0 , 1 , 2 , ‚Ä¶ , so that the lowesteigenstate for a given ‚Ñì is the one with= 0 , namelyThe accuracy of approximation ( 3 ) is thus displayed in the ratioa quantity that approaches unity with increasing ‚Ñì.This follows from the fact that in the large ‚Ñì limit the trialand the exact result correspond to strictly circular orbits .

Donald Trump 's incoming White House chief of staff has refused to rule out a registry system as part of their administration 's anti-terrorist strategy .
Reince Priebus said the President-elect was not planning to create a Muslim registry , despite their repeated and flippant promises throughout the campaign .
But Mr Priebus , an American attorney and Republican National Committee chairperson , left the door open for some kind of vetting process .

‚Äú Look , I 'm not going to rule out anything , ‚Äù they said , speaking on Sunday during NBC 's Meet The Press .
‚Äú We 're not going to have a registry based on a religion .
‚Äú But what I think we 're trying to do is say that there are some people , certainly not all people ‚Ä¶ there are some people that are radicalised .
‚Äú And there are some people that have to be prevented from coming into this country . ‚Äù
The billionaire tycoon , in a November 2015 video , described a network that would trace Muslims ‚Äì despite a spokesperson this month claiming they ‚Äú never advocated ‚Äù such a policy .
Mr Preibus added : ‚Äú President Trump 's position is consistent with bills in the House and the Senate that say the following : If you want to come from a place or an area around the world that harbours and trains terrorists , we have to temporarily suspend that operation until a better vetting system is put in place .
`` When a better vetting system is put in place then those radical folks , they 'll not be allowed in , but then others will be allowed in , but only until that is done . That 's what General Michael Flynn believes and that 's what President Trump believes . ''
Michael Flynn , Mr Trump 's incoming national security advisor , earlier this year branded Islam a ‚Äú political ideology ‚Äù that ‚Äú hides behind ‚Äù religion , and likened it to ‚Äú malignant cancer ‚Äù .
Last week , Mr Priebus claimed Mr Trump paid a $ 25m settlement over the university fraud case to avoid ‚Äú distraction ‚Äù .

Thirteen years ago , on the first season of the CBS reality competition ‚Äú Big Brother , ‚Äù one houseguest was William Collins , also known as Will Mega , an intensely political black man who proved polarizing in the house for their sometimes confrontational talk about race . It was a novelty , this sort of conversation , in network prime time , and in the eyes of Americans , perhaps not a welcome one : the audience voted Mr. Collins off the show first .
In the years since , ‚Äú Big Brother ‚Äù casts have displayed token diversity , but rarely has race been a subject of conversation , partly because of the producers ' apparent belief that it will arise only when members of a minority group are present and vocal , a scenario they 've largely avoided .
This season , though , race has become the dominant narrative thanks to a handful of white cast members who 've turned the show , which runs three nights a week , into a rare opportunity to watch white privilege and unconscious racism in the field . It may be occurring in a sealed-off space , but it 's feasting on the oxygen of national network television .
Sunday 's episode was the most disturbing of the season so far . Aaryn Gries , a young white woman , flipped the mattress of Candice Stewart , one of the show 's black cast members , then taunted Ms. Stewart with an exaggerated , stereotypical voice : ‚Äú What you gon ' do , girl ? ‚Äù and ‚Äú Where 's yo class , girl ? ‚Äù They were soon backed up by another white cast member , GinaMarie Zimmerman , who screamed at Ms. Stewart , ‚Äú You want the black to come out ? ‚Äù
I 'm sure that , if you 're reading this , you 've got a registration to at least one online casino , right ? Okay , let 's do a little bit of a practical experiment ! And I 'm serious , I really want you to do this experiment on your own , as you 're reading this , okay ? It 's very easy ‚Äì all you need to do is log into your casino and check out the slots section . Most online casinos have a couple of slots that they put front and center , featuring them and pushing them in the faces of their players . I want you to tell me how many of these slots are licensed ( or , in other words , based on an existing property ‚Äì ‚Äú Game of Thrones ‚Äù , ‚Äú South Park ‚Äù , ‚Äú Avengers ‚Äù , something like that ) . I do n't need an exact number , just a rough estimate . Go ahead and check them out , I 'll wait . Did you check them ? Well , if my hunch is correct , most of the featured slots there were licensed , were n't they ? Do n't worry , I 'm not psychic or anything ‚Äì this is quite common ! In fact , if you look at the reviews of the most popular UK casino sites , you 'll notice that the same thing happens pretty much everywhere ‚Äì the featured slots are almost always licensed . But why ?
Well , there are quite a lot of reasons for that , honestly . In the world of branded products ( which slots are ) , licensing is nothing new ‚Äì the most popular products often tend to carry a brand name . We 're talking ‚Äú Ghostbusters ‚Äù drinks , ‚Äú Star Wars ‚Äù cookies , ‚Äú Game of Thrones ‚Äù coloring books‚Ä¶ Any product you can think of , the most popular version is either licensed or has been around for decades and has a long-standing connection with consumers . Hell , even the most popular movies coming out these days , like all those Marvel movies , ‚Äú Power Rangers ‚Äù or ‚Äú Transformers ‚Äù are all licensed properties ( even if in Marvel 's case the people who created the original material are the same ones who are also making the licensed product , which is rare ) , and , in the case of ‚Äú Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them ‚Äù , we 're getting five movies based on eight movies based on seven books . Damn ! All that for a little extra popularity ? You better friggin ' believe it !
Currently , the market is oversaturated with products ‚Äì there are dozens of people who make cookies or toilet paper , for example . It 's especially bad when , due to laws , regulations or just common sense , you are unable to make your product that much different from the product of someone else . So how do you still make people invest in YOUR version as opposed to your competitors ? Licensing is a great way to do exactly that . As you may have noticed , most slots are fairly similar to each other due to very strict gambling laws which are active in places like the UK . As a result , people tend to be more attracted to a slot with a name they recognize , like ‚Äú Game of Thrones ‚Äù , rather than something that sounds utterly boring and foreign to them , like , say , ‚Äú Bratislava Bingo 2 : Electric Boogaloo ‚Äù . Slot developers have noticed that , so they generally place bigger budgets and more effort into slots that are licensed , knowing that they 're going to be more popular than the rest . Players catch on , realize that most licensed slots are better than the rest , and start playing even more of them . It 's a bit of a closed circle , honestly , and one that casinos have very much taken advantage of by placing licensed properties front and center .
So that 's why licensed slots are featured in so many online casinos ‚Äì they tend to be better than the rest , and players flock to them like ants on sugar . It 's not like non-licensed slots are discriminated against ( some non-licensed ones , like ‚Äú Mega Moolah ‚Äù , are still among the most popular choices ) , it 's just that most players generally prefer the properties they 're familiar with and know will be better-made than the rest . There 's nothing really wrong with that .
SCP-2433
NOTICE FROM THE FOUNDATION RECORDS AND INFORMATION SECURITY ADMINISTRATION While it is unclear how SCP-2433 operates , it is hypothesized that this file may possibly qualify as an instance of SCP-2433-1 ; this file is to be treated like an instance of SCP-2433-1 as a precaution . Printed versions of this file are believed to be safe , and is available to all personnel with sufficient clearance . All edits to this file are recorded and sent to RAISA as precaution . ‚Äî Maria Jones , Director , RAISA
SCP-2433 ( BRI of 0 )
Item # : SCP-2433
Object Class : Euclid
Special Containment Procedures : All identified copies of SCP-2433-1 are currently saved on a designated hard drive found in Wing C on Site-17 . Each saved instance of SCP-2433-1 should be accompanied by a text file detailing recovered site , estimated people affected , and other relevant information , including discovery location , estimated exposure , and calculated BRI . Testing regarding SCP-2433 is open to all Site-17 staff with Security Clearance 2 or higher , as long as the experiment does not involve the usage of an Internet connection ; all testing conducted that seeks to use the Internet in any setting require the permission of Site Director Putnam . SCP-2433-1 instances created for the sake of testing must be recorded .
Foundation web crawlers in tandem with image recognition software are to search for images that bear similarities to SCP-2433 . Facial recognition software is not to be used as previous protocol revealed large amounts of false-positives . Confirmed instances of SCP-2433-1 need to be removed immediately from public view if possible . Site Director Putnam should be notified if an instance is calculated to have a BRI of higher than 40 .
Currently , there are 73 confirmed instances of SCP-2433-1 ; the associated MD5 hashes of these images are grounds for instant removal of the image . Social media websites and image sharing sites such as Facebook , Reddit , Tumblr , 4chan , Twitter , and Pinterest are given priority due to the large userbase and potential accumulation of SCP-2433-Œº events .
Members of MTF Lambda-84 ( `` Sample Text '' ) have joined the security detail of the United States Senate as well as the city of Burlington to monitor for any increase of SCP-2433-Œº events , as well as collection of Œº-A instances if possible . Due to the large amount of Œº-A instances collected each day , as well as its non-anomalous properties , MTF Lambda-84 has been given permission to dispose Œº-A instances at their own discretion unless otherwise notified .
As per request of Foundation Records and Information Security Administration ( RAISA ) , it is strictly forbidden to download this file , as precaution against this file possibly being considered an instance of SCP-2433-1 .
SCP-2433-1-53 , a highly elaborate example of SCP-2433-1 that may display common motifs of the `` vaporwave '' subculture ( BRI of 63.8 )
Description : SCP-2433 is an image of Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders giving a speech , taken around August 2015 during a campaign event in Florida .
SCP-2433-1 are a collection of images that are altered forms of SCP-2433 through conventional image editing software . Testing has shown that the primary effect of SCP-2433 persists no matter the degree of alteration or the amount it resembles the original image . The majority of SCP-2433-1 instances ( 52 instances , or 71 % of all current confirmed instance ) are merely watermarked , resized , or filtered instances of other SCP-2433-1 instances , however , several are believed to have originated from the same origin as the anomalous qualities of SCP-2433 .
Testing has confirmed that the images yield no anomalous memetic qualities when viewed . The primary anomalous effect occurs when the image is shared , discussed or otherwise interacted with online , triggering a SCP-2433-Œº event . Simply viewing a SCP-2433 or SCP-2433-1 instance does not trigger a SCP-2433-Œº event , and show no anomalous qualities when printed or taken offline . `` Interaction '' has been confirmed to include :
Indicating interest or other feelings , such as `` liking '' on Facebook , Tumblr and Twitter
Sharing with others , such as forwarding through email or retweeting on Twitter
Downloading and reuploading
Leaving a comment or post about the image ; referencing the image without the image being present on the website does not seem to trigger a SCP-2433-Œº event
SCP-2433-1-09 , an early example that may have come from the same source as the anomalous properties of SCP-2433 ( BRI of 23.9 )
When an SCP-2433-Œº event occurs , American quarters ( designated as item Œº-A ) materialize in a 50 meter radius around Senator Sanders . No instance of Œº-A has been observed to materialize in solid or liquid matter . Based on material , year minted , scratches , general wear and tear , as well as trace amount of biological matter from fingerprints left on Œº-A instances indicate that the origin of the coin is different each time , likely from random sources across the United States each time a SCP-2433-Œº event occurs .
When SCP-2433-Œº events occur due to the unaltered SCP-2433 , Œº-A instances materialize in close proximity to Senator Sanders , and usually on surfaces such as tabletops and desk drawers , and may be within visual range of Senator Sanders . However , the degree of alteration present in SCP-2433-1 increases the possible furthest point of manifestation and becomes less predictable as the Balkin Resemblance Index ( BRI ) increases .
The base BRI has been defined to be 0 for the original SCP-2433 only in the context of this report and related research . It is hypothesized that a maximum BRI to which would trigger SCP-2433-Œº events exist ; however , testing is inconclusive to the maximum value of BRI , as it is also hypothesized that the manifestation field would increase with BRI .
Currently , SCP-2433-Œº events average at 14 manifestations every hour ; before containment procedures were put in place , it was estimated to average at 90 manifestations every hour . The amount of manifestations increases from 1600 hours to 2400 hours EST , then gradually slows down . Manifestation amounts also increase usually on weekends .
Senator Sanders has displayed no knowledge or control over SCP-2433 and SCP-2433-Œº events .
Addendum 2433-A : The origins of SCP-2433 were unclear until a raid on the headquarters of GoI-5869 on 11/16/16 . No persons of interest have been found .

Here 's a dusty older tank I made a couple years back . It 's a German Stug III Ausf F by Dragon ( a Japanese company that makes model kits ) . The tanks full name is Sturmgesch√ºtz , which means Assault Gun in German . At first it was just an infantry support tank but later in the war it was modified to be a tank destroyer . It had a very low profile to it , which meant it could be easily placed in an ambush position , unlike other tanks which could be very tall and left an obvious silhouette.This is actually one of the first models I took seriously when I was building it , you should see some of my first models , they were horrible . I think I still have two planes left ( f-4 phantom and I think a p-40 ) , I 'll see if I can dig em out and get some pictures.I tried to get most of the dust an pet fur off but did n't want to risk breaking something . I 'm already missing the periscope that 's supposed to be in that slot on the top . Also , the pictures are kind of large , 1469x1102 . And that 's cut in half from the originals .
A soldier blown up by an explosive device in Afghanistan has been forced to remortgage their home to pay for pioneering artificial limb surgery in Australia .
War hero Clive Smith is spending ¬£90,000 flying 10,000 miles to Sydney for a operation which they hope will transform their life .
They said they have been left with no choice because the NHS and the Ministry of Defence have betrayed him , despite pledges that injured veterans would get the best possible care .
Sapper Smith , who stepped on a landmine in Helmand Province in 2010 , has been in a wheelchair for 12 months , waiting for new prosthetic limbs .
Mr Smith , who was the face of the Poppy fundraising appeal in 2012 and took part in the Invictus Games , said : `` I 've put my life on the line for my country and I feel let down that I am now having to put my home on the line to get the best treatment .
`` I 've finally lost my patience with the NHS .
`` They are not looking after veterans . I 'm stuck in a wheelchair with my life on hold and it 's not fair . I want to be out and about but I ca n't because I 've no legs to wear . ''
They plan to benefit from a new technique in which titanium rods bond to their bones and the new limb is screwed on . It creates an almost seamless fit .
The process gives amputees the sensation of walking naturally .
Mr Smith , of Cannock , Staffs , lost their legs above the knee while leading a ten-man patrol from 33 Engineer Regiment to find buried bombs in the Nahr-e Saraj district of Helmand in October 2010 .
After their horrific experience , the 30-year-old faced a struggle to walk again and rebuild their life with the help of prosthetic legs supplied by the NHS . But due to poor fitting , they suffered agonising chafing and blistering and was unable to wear their new legs .
They had to have plastic surgery to repair skin on their stumps damaged by the rubbing . And for the last 12 months they have been virtually housebound while waiting for the NHS to fit new casts .
The British government has promised trials of the technique next year . But with a limit of 20 patients and 250 veterans with leg amputations , there are no guarantees that Mr Smith will be chosen to take part .
Their girlfriend Jen Price said : `` We are so angry at the poor care for veterans generally that we set up a petition to the Government .
`` I 'm absolutely livid . Clive does n't want anything more than to live a normal life . They were serving Queen and country and all they ask in return is to be able to walk again . ''

The surgeon who will perform the surgery is a refugee who fled Iraq after they were ordered to cut off the ears of draft dodgers by dictator Saddam Hussein 's brutal regime .
Prosthetics expert Dr Munjed Al Muderis , 42 , now based in Sydney , said : `` These young British soldiers were sent to help Iraq and Afghanistan stand on their own two feet and were met with terrorism . I feel ashamed of that . The very least I can do is say sorry by helping them get their mobility back . ''
The charity Help for Heroes is funding Mr Smith and Jen to fly out to Australia and to cover their expenses during what is likely to be a two month stay .
A spokesperson for Help for Heroes said : `` We are delighted to be able to give Clive ¬£9,000 to help them while they are in Australia . ''
The NHS said it was `` disappointed '' to hear of Mr Smith 's experience . A spokesperson added : `` Providing excellent care for war veterans is a priority . ''
Does anyone else remember seeing ads for these in the back of British Car many years ago ? The idea was sound ; take a relatively common and inexpensive sports car , an MGB in this case , and clothe it with a modern body evocative of a Miata , Alfa Spider , or Lotus . Canadian Barry Preston did this in the early 1990 's with their Brooklands and Barn Finds reader Joe P has discovered one for sale on Kijiji in Ontario , Canada for only $ 1,500 !
I was able to find an image of a similar but not identical Brooklands conversion with a little searching . As most of the body modifications to the MGB shell were made with fiberglass , it 's apparent that each Brooklands could be a little different , and possibly customized to the owners ' desires . Most references to Brooklands on the internet refer to Ford V-6 and Rover V-8 engined versions ; I was not able to find any specific ones that kept the MGB drivetrain‚Äîmaybe our readers can enlighten us ? I do remember the old advertisements calling out Ford V-6 's .
Although no powertrain details are given for this car , the fact that it is rolling on MGB wheels , has what look like MGB gauges and an MGB shifter as well as a stock MGB exhaust location lead me to believe that this Brooklands is B powered . Not a bad thing , at least for parts and yes , reliability . I race an MGB-powered car and can attest to the longevity of the stock engine and transmission under stressful conditions . Looking at the rear of this example , I see late Alfa Romeo Spider influence , and maybe a little TVR 280i ?
By utilizing the stock MGB door structure , windshield and cowl , the Brooklands was able to bypass some of the major problem areas ‚Äú kit cars ‚Äù or ‚Äú specially assembled vehicles ‚Äù face . Although the seller states that the car is ‚Äú all there except for the dead mice ‚Äù , I have to wonder whether the headlight assemblies and front valence are still around , and why they were n't pictured .
This looks like a great opportunity to get into a truly unique automobile that no one else will have a clue about for not a lot of money . From all reports , the original Brooklands cars were finished to a high standard , although we have no way of knowing if this is a ‚Äò factory built ' car or a home-assembled kit . In any case , the question is‚Ä¶ do you have a spot in your garage for this rare conversion ?

Su ' a Cravens , center , is mobbed by their teammates after an interception against the Giants last season . ( Toni L. Sandys/The Washington Post )
Chris Thompson did n't know . The Redskins running back is positioned on the opposite side of the locker room from safety Su ' a Cravens , who was placed on the exempt/left squad list after being talked out of retirement Sunday morning . And he 's on the other side of the ball as an offensive player .
They did n't have much to say about Cravens 's specific situation after practice , other than that they were praying for him . It served as a reminder that sometimes a teammate , like any colleague , does n't know what 's going on in the private lives of their co-workers . All Thompson could draw from was their own experiences in a world that sometimes separates the athlete from the human being .
‚Äú It 's way bigger than football , ‚Äù Thompson said . ‚Äú So for him , I hope they get to handle everything and gets themselves back together with whatever may be going on . ‚Äù
Some in the Redskins ' fan base reacted angrily to the news , not surprising given the broad perception of athletes . After all , they have money and fame , and they 're living a dream many would kill for . Why are they complaining ?
[ Su ' a Cravens stuns teammates and leaves Redskins scrambling with their plan to retire ]
This is all true . But athletes are also humans , a fact that often gets overlooked in sports fans ' myopic perspective of them ‚Äî and , at times , the narrow perspective of the athletes themselves . Cravens 's situation is a reminder that life can be mentally and emotionally overbearing , whether it 's working in a cubicle with five people or playing on a field in front of 50,000 .
‚Äú That 's the tough part about being professional athletes , ‚Äù said Thompson , who defended Cravens in the comments section of a team fan page on Instagram on Sunday . ‚Äú We 're not looked at as being regular human beings . We 're basically looked at as these objects running around on a field , or on a court , and making a lot of money and putting smiles on people 's faces that love their teams . That 's what it is , and it 's sad that it has to be that way because we 're humans . And we 're just regular people . ‚Äù
That sometimes gets lost for fans of professional sports , when their rooting interest is no longer a school , but a franchise . There is n't , at the minimum , a three-year expectation as there is in college fandom . Three years is the average career length in the NFL , where even rookies are expected to contribute immediately . With a new crop of players entering the system every spring , the window of opportunity can close just as quickly as it opened .
‚Äú It 's hard to understand unless you 're going through it or doing it , ‚Äù said linebacker Will Compton , who is good friends with Cravens but did n't want to discuss their personal matters . ‚Äú This is a stressful business , man . It really is . You 're in a performance-based business every single day of your life . There 's really no getting away from that . ‚Äù
Whatever their situation , Cravens thought it was hard enough to end their NFL dreams before the start of their second season at 22 .
Less than 12 hours after the public found out about Cravens 's retirement request , they reflected on their football life on Snapchat by posting newspaper clippings . Cravens snapped a survey they filled out as a sophomore in high school , asking what was their dream job . They wrote the NFL . When asked what skillsets it would take to get there , Cravens wrote discipline , athleticism and hard work while telling their followers , ‚Äú Do n't tell me dreams do n't come true . ‚Äù
[ Brewer : Su ' a Cravens requires a delicate approach , and the Redskins actually seem to be taking one ]
All of that was deleted the next morning from their Snapchat story . Their Instagram has been scrubbed clean of just about every mention of the Redskins , leaving mainly their memories to what was likely a better time at USC .
‚Äú In college , our fans are so great that they really care about us as human beings too , ‚Äù said Thompson , who played at Florida State from 2009-12 . ‚Äú When I got to this level , it was like , oh , we 're just objects that play for your team . You do n't care how I am as a person . You do n't care what I 've got going on off the field . All you care is about is what I can do for you and how I can make you feel on Sundays . It 's tough . ‚Äù
It 's an uphill battle for an athlete to remain genuine , as Thompson experienced nearly a year ago when they shared the joy they felt about their brother being released from prison after serving 15 years .
My brother gets released from prison today after 15 years . He 'll finally get to watch their little brother play ball . This means a lot to me . ‚Äî Chris Thompson ( @ ChrisThompson_4 ) September 12 , 2016
While some celebrated with him , there was enough negativity they received that ate them up .
‚Äú It hurt , ‚Äù Thompson said . ‚Äú It made me upset , but then I honestly had to come back to myself and be like , man , it 's gon na be humans like that . Just nasty , unhappy , mean people ; that 's what it is . I have to remind myself of that because I will want to trigger and say something to these people , but it 's all on social media . If that person saw me man-to-man , they would n't say a word . So , I have to think about that also . These people are basically hiding behind their phones , or computers , saying all this stuff and their profile picture is of something else that 's not even them . I think that says a lot too . We just have to find a way to deal with it , and it 's tough because it 's always like , ‚Äò You play football . You should n't care about this . You should n't care about that . ' Nah . If I was saying something to you about how bad you were at your job , you 'd feel some type of way about that . ‚Äù
It 's part of the long-standing social construct between the professional athlete and the fan . No matter how many autographs Cravens and Thompson sign , they will still be regarded as athletes , and therefore not like the rest of us . Even if they say , feel or think otherwise .
‚Äú I just hope people on the outside see that we 're talking about a human being , not just a football player and somebody that you see playing on Sundays for your team , ‚Äù Thompson said . ‚Äú It 's waayyyy bigger than that . I ca n't stress that enough . ‚Äù

This time we 're taking a look at the Affinity case for the Nexus 6 , arguably the most popular phone among hardcore android fans . With Google going back to charging full flagship prices for their Nexus devices , it only makes sense to protect your investment as much as possible and the Affinity is a great option to protect your phone without adding a ton of bulk .
Look And Feel
The Affinity for the Nexus 6 shares it 's looking with the Affinity for the iPhone 6 which we reviewed last month . With a clear frosted back , you 'll definitely be able to show off the Cloud White or Midnight Blue Nexus 6 . The bottom and sides of the case are black hard TPU material . The same frosted material that covers the back is cut into the sides of the case so you can see in that way too .
The Affinity makes the phone feel incredibly sturdy . The Nexus 6 is a well built phone in the first place but with this case on it you 'll should n't have to worry about bending or forces that are applied to the body of the phone . Certainly not bend proof , but this case does provide excellent support to the frame . The fact that the Affinity can do this without adding much bulk to an already big phone is pretty impressive .
Protection
The Poetic Affinity is a bit of a hybrid case . It does n't come apart like other hybrid cases but it does feature two different parts of the case serving two different purposes . The first is the frosted plastic back I mentioned above . This is n't going to add much in the way of grip but it will make your phone scratch proof which is pretty important with a big phone . Any damage to your phone is really going to stand out on the Nexus 6 .
The second part of the case is the strong sides . With built-in extra bumpers on the corners this thing is built to withstand a fall . The case gets a little fat on the corners but since you 're not normally touching the top corners on the back of the phone and there 's not much of a bulk issue on the bottom , this is basically protection with no cost of functionality . This is n't the most protective case ever made but it 'll definitely get you through the day with peace of mind about any drops you may have .
The plastic on the back is n't very thick but I do n't doubt it would protect the casing of the phone , from more than scratches , in case of drops on the back . With only a cut out for the camera , but maintaining the awesome curved back of the phone , the Affinity defility is a full coverage case . I love that you can get protection while still seeing the back of the phone . I think Motorola did an excellent job with the design of the Nexus 6 and the Affinity gets major points for protecting my phone and not covering it up .
Conclusion
There 's a reason that people know the name Poetic . Their cases are really high quality for a low price and the Poetic Affinity is no different . We definitely give it points for the frosted back which shows off the design of the phone and the padded corners of the case for extra protection from falls . It 's impossible to make a case for the Nexus 6 and make it not feel due to the enormous size of the Nexus 6 but Poetic does as well as you can here .
You can pick up the Poetic Affinity for the Nexus 6 on Amazon for $ 12.95 with free Prime shipping .

Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha yesterday ordered the Royal Thai Air Force ( RTAF ) to help expedite immigration and customs processes to help reduce waiting times at airports .
It is the latest effort to streamline the process of entering the kingdom and reduce long queues for passengers arriving on international flights .
The Immigration Bureau is also seeking to amend the immigration law to exempt Thai nationals from filling out immigration documents known as TM.6 cards . It is not known at this stage when this will materialise .
The bureau 's actions were prompted by huge queues at Don Mueang airport last weekend , when thousands of visitors had to wait several hours to clear immigration and customs .
Not long after , international arrivals at Suvarnabhumi airport experienced similar queues on Wednesday afternoon after 20 aircraft landed between 3pm-4pm , discharging 4,600 passengers .
However , the Immigration Division 2 said immigration officers were at full strength at the time and were able to clear passengers within 57 minutes .
In response to the incidents , Gen Prayut said yesterday they had told the Immigration Bureau to open all counters for service , and in case of a shortage of staff , RTAF officers would be brought in to help . The prime minister said there are several factors contributing to long immigration waits , including limited space at Don Mueang airport .
While the airport can handle 1,000-2,800 people an hour , there are as many as 4,000 passengers arriving at the same time due to delayed flights , said Gen Prayut , adding that authorities would look into whether the airport can be expanded .
`` We have to investigate when congestion occurs and why . I 've told the Immigration Bureau to open all immigration counters . And I 've asked the air force commander to bring in personnel to help when they are short staffed .
`` The Transport Ministry , the Airports of Thailand and the Immigration Bureau have been assigned to deal with the task . If this is n't enough to handle the issue , we have to figure something else out , '' Gen Prayut said .
Immigration Bureau commissioner Nathathorn Prousoontorn said talks would be held among the authorities concerned including the Airports of Thailand on the prime minister 's directive .
However , the commissioner insisted that RTAF personnel would not be allowed to process passengers through immigration because that jurisdiction belongs to immigration officials only under the immigration law . They added that their assistance could be used in other areas .
They said discussions should be concluded in a week , and assistance from the RTAF might not be needed if things work out .
Pol Lt Gen Nathathorn said that as a relief measure 200 immigration officers at other border checkpoints have been called in to help at three airports -- Don Mueang , Suvarnabhumi and Phuket -- that are seeing an unusual increase in passengers despite it being the low season .
Immigration counters at the Don Mueang will be increased from 21 to 39 in a few weeks , they said .
They admitted that immigration officer numbers at the international airports are low , and that is beyond the bureau 's control , saying the Royal Thai Police ( RTP ) is responsible for job allocating .
Don Mueang and Suvarnabhumi airports have seen a steady increase in air travel over the past few years .
According to the Immigration Bureau , in July 2014 , a few months after the coup , 526,224 passengers passed through Don Mueang airport .
During the high season in December last year , that number stood at 605,435 passengers and in July this year , passengers passing through Don Mueang stood at 1.22 million .
The number of passengers passing through Suvarnabhumi in July 2014 stood at 1.84 million . That figure rose to 2.9 million in December last year and shot up to 3.04 million in July this year .
Meanwhile , RTAF spokesperson VAM Pongsak Semachai said the RTAF would have to study the law to determine what it could do to help .
They said air force commander Johm Rungswang has asked for a review of the law and the air force 's rule book to see how the air force can help in this matter .
`` We need to see if it is possible for air force officers to conduct immigration duties , '' they said .
National police chief Chakthip Chaijinda yesterday said that forward command centres at five airports -- Suvarnabhumi , Don Mueang , Phuket , Chiang Mai and Hat Yai -- were told to speed up immigration procedures . Action would be taken against them if they do not .
Image caption Christian Gerhartsreiter came to the US as a teenager
A German man who claimed to be a descendant of US oil tycoon John D Rockefeller has been charged with murder over the disappearance of a man from California more than 25 years ago .
Lawyers filed the charge against Christian Gerhartsreiter , 49 , who has taken on many identities in the past .
Gerhartsreiter had previously been considered a person of interest in the 1985 killing of John Sohus .
They are currently in prison for kidnapping their seven-year-old daughter .
Gerhartsreiter was found guilty of kidnapping their daughter and assaulting the child 's social worker in 2009 in Baltimore , in the US state of Maryland .
In the past , they have claimed to be Clark Rockefeller , a supposed heir to the Rockefeller oil fortune .
Unearthed body
Gerhartsreiter had been living with John Sohus 's mother in San Marino , a wealthy suburb of Los Angeles , the city 's district attorney 's office said .
Mr Sohus 's body was uncovered in the backyard of their mother 's home in 1994 . Police said they had been killed aged 27 by an injury to the head .
Mr Gerhartsreiter 's lawyers have said they are surprised by the charge against their client .
`` Based on all the information that I have , I believe in their innocence , '' said Jeffrey Denner , a lawyer for Mr Gerhartsreiter .
`` I 'm very interested in seeing what new evidence that the government has come up with that prompted them to the point of actually charging him . ''
Mr Denner said they were due to meet their client on Wednesday to discuss the new charge .
Mr Gerhartsreiter , who went by the name Christopher Chichester during their time in San Marino , vanished soon after Mr Sohus 's disappearance , prosecutors said .
They have adopted a number of other personas over the years , ranging from a physicist to a ship 's captain to a billionaire art collector .

Emily Althaus won our hearts last season on Orange is the New Black as Maureen Kukudio , the sweet and quirky new love interest for Suzanne ‚Äú Crazy Eyes ‚Äù Warren .
I recently had the pleasure of speaking with Althaus about their role on the show , what it was like to join the cast , and why Orange is the New Black is so important .
We came to know and love Althaus 's character during Orange is the New Black Season 3 , but that was n't the role they had originally planned on . ‚Äú I did n't have many heads up as to what it was gon na be . I auditioned initially to play Pennsatucky 's mom in a flashback , actually , ‚Äù Althaus explained .
‚Äú It was sort of told me , ‚Äò listen we 're not going to use you for this , but they like you and want to write a thing for you . ' And at the time , I just had no idea what they meant , and I do n't think they even knew at that moment what it meant . We sort of started with a couple of lines in a couple of episodes . ‚Äù
‚Äú I 'm so lucky they kept me around , ‚Äù Althaus continued . ‚Äú We kind of got to play together , and kind of make this , you know , girl who 's slightly left of center and certainly a lot of fun to play , but not anything I got to overthink too much . ‚Äù
In fact , Althaus had quite a bit of influence over how their character evolved . ‚Äú Our writers are so great . They 're just really good at what they do , and one of the things that makes them just phenomenal is that they take performers into consideration , ‚Äù they explained .
‚Äú I remember getting my first set of pages for the day , and you know , there was n't really a breakdown of whom this character was , because it was n't who I had auditioned for , and there was never really much conversation before I got to start . So I remember sort of making a couple choices , and I think that combined with the writing that was already there started to form this girl who was a little different . ‚Äù
Althaus said they remembered a conversation with writer Nick Jonas , where they asked them what they felt like they knew about their character . ‚Äú I said based on some writing in one of the episodes , I kind of felt like they could be somewhere on the spectrum , and maybe they were autistic , but not to pin them down into any certain thing ‚Äî I was n't sure. ‚Äù Jones told them they liked that idea and wanted to keep going with it .
‚Äú There is freedom for it to mold and change as they get to know the performers , which is really cool , ‚Äù Althaus said .
Another example of that was with Uzo Aduba 's character , Suzanne , a.k.a . Crazy Eyes . ‚Äú I do n't think they had any idea what a huge part they were going to play in this show . And that was a combo of what they had written and also Uzo showing up and being , you know , Uzo . ‚Äù
Of course , Althaus spent quite a bit of time working with Aduba , who they spoke very highly of . ‚Äú Uzo is just the most generous team partner / playmate . Often , I feel like I refer to them as like , when I 'm in a scene with her , that it 's like being on a playground , for an actor anyway . It 's like that sort of openness of anything goes . And you can try anything , and you 're safe , and you know that the person opposite of you is listening and so engaged . Every good thing that comes to that woman , they deserve . I fully believe that . She 's a force . ‚Äù
Althaus also spoke to one of their favorite episodes to be a part of , which was the beginning of Maureen 's relationship with Suzanne . ‚Äú The whole episode leading up to where I 'm kind of inviting Crazy Eyes to maybe meet me in the closet for like a little ‚Äò sexual healing , ' ‚Äù they laughed as they described the episode . ‚Äú There was something so poignant , and sweet , and adorable about that scene between those two characters to me that I just really loved . ‚Äù
‚Äú My character 's purpose , I think sometimes , is to show more of Uzo 's character . And I love that , ‚Äù Althaus continued . They described Suzanne as a character who we 've seen love everyone around them and give so much , so now , it 's satisfying ‚Äú to finally get to see what it looks like for them when someone chooses her . ‚Äù
Joining the cast of Orange is the New Black was exciting for Althaus , particularly because they were already a fan of the show . Actually , Althaus began watching early on to support Danielle Brooks , who they had once done a play with .
‚Äú I remember their booking that show and thinking , oh , I just want to watch this to support her , ‚Äù Althaus said . But of course , it was no time before they ( like most of us ) was hooked on the show . ‚Äú Probably my most fangirl private moment was realizing that I was going to be bunk mates with Lori Petty , ‚Äù they added .
There are plenty of reasons to love Orange is the New Black . Besides being entertaining , its subject matter is important , and its characters are diverse . ‚Äú It 's empowering , I think , to women who have n't seen their person on TV yet , ‚Äù Althaus said .
‚Äú We still have such a long way to go when it comes to diversity in television , in film , in theater . I mean , honestly , it 's a little embarrassing in 2016 to have to celebrate this aspect of it . I would love for this to go without saying . But it is really cool . ‚Äù
‚Äú I do n't think it 's a coincidence that Orange is as wildly popular as it is , and it also happens to be diverse , ‚Äù they continued .
‚Äú There is more representation here than there has been in other programs , if you will [ laughs ] . That 's what my mom would call it . Programs . I also think there is something to be said for the subject matter of prison . Of looking at the stories of people who end up in these institutions and how it , certainly I would say 95 % of the time , there 's more than meets the eye to these situations ‚Äî to these very complex stories . There 's a human and a family behind every face that you see on our show . And certainly in the real prison institution of our country , there are all these people with stories to be heard . ‚Äù
Althaus also spoke to one way that they were able to get involved : working with the Women 's Prison Association . ‚Äú I know a lot of the girls support and go to a lot of the events that they have , where they really are involved with women who get out of prison , and now what ? They need jobs , they need clothing , they need support for their families , ‚Äù they explained .
‚Äú It 's a really cool thing to go to these events and see these women who are re-entering the workforce , and because of this amazing organization , getting the support that they deserve and that they need to re-acclimate into society . And that 's been an honor to witness and be a small part of . ‚Äù
As for what we can look forward to on Orange is the New Black Season 4 , Althaus was n't able to say much , but they did say there was a lot to be excited about . ‚Äú I can say confidently it is nothing like any other season before it . And I think it 's just going to pack some major punches for those who have been with the show for a long time . I think it 's just going to be an exciting one to watch . ‚Äù
We 're definitely excited !
Be sure to catch Emily Althaus on Orange is the New Black when it returns for Season 4 on June 17th to Netflix .

The ‚Äú shift and blame ‚Äù trick used by Jewish Supremacists to take advantage of a situation and then blaming any inequities upon Europeans‚Äîas vividly demonstrated with the Jewish domination of American higher educational institutions‚Äîhas also been used when it comes to the economic and social exploitation of blacks , an article in the Jerusalem Post has revealed .
The article points out the ‚Äú civil rights ‚Äù movement was led by Jews while at the same time Jews were the leading exploiters of blacks in the ghetto . And at the same time Jews exploited blacks as slum lords and easy credit , high interest merchants , they were promoting blacks in America in their Jewish-dominated Hollywood !
It also admits funding of major Jewish organizations by power gangsters and organized crime bosses like Meyer Lansky !
This is an amazing article and typical of what you can often find in publications by Jews for Jews , but absent in the Jewish controlled press in America and Europe for Gentile consumption .
The article , titled ‚Äú The Donald Sterling saga and its implications for Jews ‚Äù is focused on the fallout that the taped comments of David Sterling/Tokowitz , owner of the LA Clippers , has had for the Jewish community in America .
‚Äú Jews were perceived members of elite white majority which exploited black workers and tenants , for owning substantial properties in black neighborhoods , ‚Äù the article is subtitled‚Äîwhich pretty much sums it up .
The Jerusalem Post points out that Tokowitz 's taped comments which recently received so much publicity are minor in comparison to the comments they made which surfaced during previous court cases they faced as a slumlord landlord in Los Angeles .
‚Äú In fact , some of their comments were deemed mild in comparison to utterances attributed to Sterling which surfaced during a class action against Sterling initiated by the US Department of Justice several years ago , wherein they were quoted as brandishing blacks as ‚Äò stinking ' and ‚Äò breeding vermin ' in their description of tenants in apartments which they owned , that prompted their policy to exclude them , ‚Äù the Jerusalem Post said .
The article goes on to say that Jewish Supremacists were the first to align themselves with blacks during the civil rights era :
‚Äú It is clear that Jewish business and spiritual leaders universally lent their active support to the civil rights movement and to African American organizations like the NAACP .
Moreover , many of the freedom riders in the South during the early 60 's were Jewish , and several dozen rabbis marched with Martin Luther King in Birmingham , Washington , DC and elsewhere . ‚Äù
This identification with the civil rights era was done , as the Jerusalem Post points out , specifically as Jews .
However , when it came to exploiting black people economically and socially , the great switcheroo is then applied , as the article points out :
‚Äú Still , Jews were perceived as members of an elite white majority which exploited black workers and tenants , and were often singled out since they owned substantial residential income and commercial properties in black neighborhoods . During the riots which followed the infamous Rodney King trial in 1992 , many Jewish establishments were set ablaze or otherwise destroyed . ‚Äù
Apart from this admission , the Jerusalem Post goes on to confirm that Hollywood is dominated by Jews :
‚Äú In the more than 20 years which have elapsed since then , a sense of harmony has evolved between the two ethnic blocks , due in part to the opportunities provided to blacks in the entertainment industry , where many of the prominent filmmakers are Jewish . ‚Äù
* The article also adds that there is no point to demanding that Jewish institutions which have received cash from Tokowitz give it back , justifying this position by listing numerous other famous Jewish criminal underworld figures who also supported Jewish causes :
‚Äú There is a collateral issue here in that there have been numerous calls within the Jewish community and elsewhere for those charities which have benefitted from Sterling 's donations to return the donated funds to the Sterling Foundation .
‚Äú These demands are likely to be summarily rebuffed and they are not supported by precedent . It is well documented that many charitable institutions , including but not limited to hospitals , schools and synagogues have benefited by the generous contributions of underworld figures like Meyer Lansky , Moe Dalitz , Arnold Rothstein and others . ‚Äù
Tokowitz ( Sterling ) is a loyal , dedicated Jew who has given tens of millions of dollars to Jewish activist organizations . The important question raised by this Jerusalem Post article is : why would Jewish supremacists like him , who calls Blacks ‚Äú stinking . . . breeding vermin ‚Äù then give millions to organizations such as the NAACP and support so-called affirmative action programs ?
The answer should be clear to all . In the Jewish drive to supremacy over the traditional American Gentile elite , anything they could do to foster self-guilt , division , and destruction of European American solidarity and interests aided their effort to takeover America and become the new American elite .
So the motivation was not any ‚Äú civil rights ‚Äù for minorities but policies they perceived as weakening the once 90 percent , European American population and the traditional elite that led America .
The Queen Of Evil Vs . The Prince Of Darkness !

The for-profit college chain ITT Technical Institute is shutting down all 130 of its U.S. campuses , including in Massachusetts in Norwood and Wilmington , saying Tuesday it ca n't survive recent sanctions by the U.S. Department of Education .
In a letter to more than 35,000 students , the Indiana-based parent company ITT Educational Services announced that campuses wo n't open for the fall term that was scheduled to begin Sept. 12 -- leaving students scrambling for last-minute options since many U.S. colleges already have started fall classes .
ITT also cut more than 8,000 jobs immediately .
The chain was banned on Aug. 25 from enrolling new students who used federal financial aid , because , Education Department officials said , the company had become a risk to students and taxpayers . The department also ordered ITT to pay $ 152 million within 30 days to help cover student refunds and other liabilities if the chain closed .
Days before those sanctions were announced , ITT 's accreditor reported the chain had failed to meet several basic standards and was unlikely to comply in the future . It had also been investigated by state and federal authorities who accused ITT of pushing students into risky loans and of misleading students about the quality of programs .
ITT Educational Services CEO Kevin Modany told reporters on a conference call Tuesday that ITT was the victim of a `` regulatory assault '' and never had the chance to defend itself .
`` For what appears to be political reasons , there seemed to be an outcome in mind that was going to be forced here , '' Modany said .
Other education companies had made overtures to buy the chain 's schools over the past year , Modany added , and ITT had offered to `` wind down '' its operations gradually if federal officials eased some of the sanctions against it , but they said federal officials rejected those options .
Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey , who in April sued ITT Tech for allegedly deceiving students , blasted the school on Tuesday .
`` If you 're depending solely on federal funds to keep you afloat and , by the way , turning around and using 80 percent of those dollars to simply fund your marketing and advertising activities to recruit more students into your programs , that 's not sustainable , '' Healey said .
Nationally , about 200 ITT employees will help students obtain grade transcripts and apply to other schools , and the chain said it is seeking agreements with other schools that would help students transfer class credits .
Massachusetts officials say they will try to help the more than 500 students here affected by the institute 's shutdown .
Healey said those affected should do three things immediately : `` Cancel all payments to the school , save your documentation , [ and ] contact our office so that you can apply for a discharge of all your federal loans , '' they said . `` That 's what we 're asking students to do . ''
Carlos Santiago , Massachusetts ' commissioner of higher education , said in a statement he 's `` consulting the leadership of our public colleges and universities to see if we can offer information and referrals for ITT students who wish to continue their education . ''

Zeus was a bit of a sorry sight after they as found tangled up in bracken on a Lake District fell ( Picture : North News )
These pictures show the moment that a dog was reunited with its owner after getting trapped in bracken for two weeks .

They spent two weeks drinking rain water before eventually being discovered by fell-walkers Jez Starkey , 42 , and Adam Briggs , 35 .
They had gone looking for them after seeing a social media campaign to find the lost dog .
They were discovered tangled in bracken and they gave them a chicken sandwich before leading them back to safety and to their owner .
Jez said : ‚Äò We came across the dog stuck in four foot high bracken . They could only move about two feet .

The policy also applies to officers and state employees buying as individuals ‚Äî but not to nongovernment-affiliated citizens .
The movement is known as the Firearms Equality Movement .
The owner of NFA Gear LLC in Beebe says they also support the movement and limits sales to law-enforcement to the same items citizens can purchase .
Large-scale law-enforcement suppliers including Glock , Ruger , Smith & Wesson , and Sig Sauer have not joined the movement and did not respond to requests for comment .

Before visiting Sudan , I thought I would run out of things to do . Instead , I ran out of time to see the many remote and hidden treasures .
Did you know that Sudan has pyramids ? They have nearly 200 pyramids , giving them the country with the biggest number of pyramids in the world !
I had a chance to visit Pyramids of Meroe , about 400km from Khartoum on the east bank of River Nile .
These ancient pyramids are not commercialized so you get to admire the entire place without any other tourists around or persuasive sellers !
Despite the many severely damaged pyramids due to treasure hunts in the past , they remain a spectacular sight .
The pyramids were not the only highlight of my trip . I have listed below other things to do while in Sudan .
Hamad An Nil ‚Äì Every Friday around 4 p.m. until sunset , the Sufi perform a ritual ceremony which includes the dervish whirls .
It is recommended for females to wear a scarf out of respect but not mandatory . The Sufi form a large circle and as visitors , you are not allowed to be standing amongst them .
Males are allowed to enter the circle given that they go barefoot while females are not allowed at all .
The Confluence of White & Blue River Nile ‚Äì Many have visited River Nile in Egypt but they forget the junction of White & Blue river Nile which contribute to River Nile .
There is an abandoned park ‚Äú Mogran Family Park ‚Äù located by a bridge for a great view . However , It was closed upon my visit and I had to go under the bridge by asking permission from the military guard on the bridge .
Tuti Island ‚Äì It is a crescent-shaped island where Blue & White Nile meet . Visit the top floor of Corinthia Hotel for a 360 view of Tuti Island as well as the confluence of Blue & White Nile .
Tea Lady ‚Äì Sudanese love their hot tea and coffee even if the weather is 40 degrees.These hot drinks are served by Tea Ladies which are found in almost every corner .
Jabal Awliya ‚Äì A small village 40km south of Khartoum great to watch local fishermen and you could pick the freshly caught fish to be fried by a park nearby for a great meal .
Buy a local popsicle to beat the heat !
Visit a Farm ‚Äì My host drove me up to the family-owned farm for a change of scenery to Khartoum .
Crash a Wedding ‚Äì And wear the traditional dress ! Only married women wear the traditional dress but since I did n't have any dress and wanted to try the local attire , I borrowed one from my host .
Mango King ŸÖŸÑŸÉ ÿßŸÑŸÖŸÜŸÇŸá
Do not miss out on the best mango juice you will ever taste ! It 's not as thick and heavy as the usual mango juice . It is also made differently by straining the juice after blending it .
Got more time to spend in Sudan ? Consider the following places to visit ; Wadi Halfa , Jabal Berkal , Port Sudan , Soleb , Musawarat , Jabal Marra , Dinder National Park , Dongola , El Kurru Tombs , Arkawit , Sanganeb and so much more !
Transport :
The best way to explore Sudan is to rent a 4√ó4 . There is lack of transportation and the places to visit are located far from the main areas .
Travel Permit :
Travelers are required to acquire a Travel and Photo permit to move outside Khartoum . Hand in one passport photo and visa copy to the Ministry of Tourism , Antiquities and Wildlife and they will provide the permit free of charge . They are closed on Fridays and Saturdays .
I had wonderful hosts in Sudan , feel free to contact them for any inquiries .

unsigned long mysql_real_escape_string ( MYSQL * mysql , char * to , const char * from , unsigned long length )
Description
This function creates a legal SQL string for use in an SQL statement . See Section 9.1.1 , ‚Äú String Literals ‚Äù .
The mysql argument must be a valid , open connection because character escaping depends on the character set in use by the server .
The string in the from argument is encoded to produce an escaped SQL string , taking into account the current character set of the connection . The result is placed in the to argument , followed by a terminating null byte .
Characters encoded are \ , ' , `` , NUL ( ASCII 0 ) ,
, \r , and Control+Z . Strictly speaking , MySQL requires only that backslash and the quote character used to quote the string in the query be escaped . mysql_real_escape_string ( ) quotes the other characters to make them easier to read in log files . For comparison , see the quoting rules for literal strings and the QUOTE ( ) SQL function in Section 9.1.1 , ‚Äú String Literals ‚Äù , and Section 12.5 , ‚Äú String Functions ‚Äù .
The string pointed to by from must be length bytes long . You must allocate the to buffer to be at least length * 2+1 bytes long . ( In the worst case , each character may need to be encoded as using two bytes , and there must be room for the terminating null byte . ) When mysql_real_escape_string ( ) returns , the contents of to is a null-terminated string . The return value is the length of the encoded string , not including the terminating null byte .

A bill prefiled in the Texas Senate for the 2017 legislative session would reform the state 's asset forfeiture laws to prohibit the state from taking property without a criminal conviction in most cases . The legislation also takes on federal forfeiture programs by banning prosecutors from circumventing state laws by passing cases off to the feds in most situations .
Sen. Konni Burton ( R-Fort Worth ) prefiled Senate Bill 380 ( SB380 ) on Dec. 20 . The legislation would reform Texas law by requiring a criminal conviction before prosecutors could proceed with asset forfeiture . Civil forfeiture would only be allowed if the property owner is unavailable or does not claim the property . Under current law , the state can seize assets even if a person is never found guilty of a crime , or even arrested .
SB380 would also prohibit state and local law enforcement from receiving proceeds from forfeited property . All funds would go to the county treasurer . Currently , up to 70 percent of asset forfeiture proceeds go directly into law enforcement agency budgets . Ending this practice would significantly curb the policing for profit motive inherent in the current law .
ADDRESSES FEDERAL PROGRAMS
SB380 also closes a loophole that allows prosecutors to bypass more stringent state asset forfeiture laws by passing cases off to the federal government under its Equitable Sharing forfeiture program . The proposed law would specifically prohibit this practice in most cases .
A law enforcement agency or attorney representing the state may not directly or indirectly transfer seized property to any federal law enforcement authority or other federal agency unless :
( 1 ) the value of the seized property exceeds $ 50,000 ; and
( 2 ) the attorney representing the state determines that :
( A ) the activity giving rise to the investigation or seizure is interstate in nature and sufficiently complex to justify the transfer ; or
( B ) the seized property may only be forfeited under federal law .
In other words the legislation does not attempt to interfere with federally initiated forfeiture , but bans state and local police from passing off their cases to federal jurisdiction in most situations .

The inclusion of provisions barring state and local law enforcement agencies from passing off cases to the feds is particularly important . In several states with strict asset forfeiture laws , prosecutors have done just that . By placing the case under federal jurisdiction , law enforcement can bypass the need for a conviction under state law and collect up to 80 percent of the proceeds from forfeited assets via the federal Equitable Sharing Program .
For example , California previously had some of the strongest state-level restrictions on civil asset forfeiture in the country , but law enforcement would often bypass the state restrictions by partnering with a federal asset forfeiture program known as ‚Äú equitable sharing. ‚Äù Under these arrangements , state officials would simply hand over forfeiture prosecutions to the federal government and then receive up to 80 percent of the proceeds‚Äîeven when state law banned or limited the practice . According to a report by the Institute for Justice , Policing for Profit , California ranked dead last of all states in the country between 2000 and 2013 as the worst offender . During the 2016 legislative session , the state closed the loophole .
As the Tenth Amendment Center previously reported the federal government inserted itself into the asset forfeiture debate in California . The feds clearly want the policy to continue .
The two firms could make an announcement in the morning Kraft Foods is expected to raise its bid for Cadbury to a level that is accepted by the UK firm , BBC business editor Robert Peston has learned . They say the US giant may raise its offer to between 840 and 850 pence per share , with 850p valuing the chocolate-maker at ¬£11.7bn . Kraft launched its hostile takeover bid for Cadbury in December , having its previous offer of 761p rejected . The two firms may jointly announce the successful bid later . Shares in Cadbury ended Monday trading up 14 pence or 1.8 % to 807.50p . No-one from either Cadbury or Kraft has been available for comment . Losing independence Our business editor said it now seems `` highly likely '' that Kraft and Cadbury will agree a deal that will probably be announced at 0700 GMT . CADBURY John Cadbury , a Quaker , opened a shop in Birmingham in 1824 , selling tea , coffee and hot chocolate - as an alternative to alcohol Dairy Milk brand introduced in 1905 , with Milk Tray coming 10 years later Merged with Schweppes drinks business in 1969 . Its drinks arm was spun off in 2008 Employs about 45,000 people in 60 countries
Read Robert Peston 's blog Cadbury 's fight for independence See Cadbury 's share price An agreement between the two companies would end the intense animosity between the firms that first manifested itself when Kraft announced its desire to own Cadbury last autumn . It would also end any doubt at all that Cadbury will lose its independence . There would still be a theoretical possibility that the US confectioner Hershey would come in with a higher offer . But if Cadbury 's board recommends Kraft 's bid , it means that the company will be taken over . Jobs fears Negotiations between Cadbury 's bankers and Kraft 's bankers are taking place overnight . KRAFT FOODS Founded in Illinois as a cheese wholesaler in 1903 Bought in 1988 by Philip Morris , which also purchased Nabisco for $ 19.2bn in 2000 before integrating it into Kraft Foods More than 40 of its brands are more than 100 years old Has 98,000 employees and 168 manufacturing and processing facilities worldwide Unions and analysts have both warned that there will likely be job losses among Cadbury 's 45,000 workforce following a takeover . Kraft has a Tuesday deadline to make its second and final formal bid for Cadbury , or else have to walk away from the deal for a year . The US giant had previously faced pressure from its leading shareholder - US billionaire investor Warren Buffett - not to overpay for Cadbury . However , Kraft raised extra funds earlier this month when it sold its North American pizza business to Swiss group Nestle for $ 3.7bn ( ¬£2.3bn ) .

RNA origami is a new method for organizing molecules on the nanoscale . Using just a single strand of RNA , this technique can produce many complicated shapes .
RNA origami is a new method for organizing molecules on the nanoscale . Using just a single strand of RNA , many complicated shapes can be fabricated by this technique . Unlike existing methods for folding DNA molecules , RNA origamis are produced by enzymes and they simultaneously fold into pre-designed shapes . These features may allow designer RNA structures to be grown within living cells and used to organize cellular enzymes into biochemical factories . The method , which was developed by researchers from Aarhus University ( Denmark ) and California Institute of Technology ( Pasadena , USA ) , is reported in the latest issue of Science .
Origami , the Japanese art of paper folding , derives its elegance and beauty from the manipulation of a single piece of paper to make a complex shape . The RNA origami method described in the new study likewise involves the folding of a single strand of RNA , but instead of the experimenters doing the folding , the molecules fold up on their own .
`` What is unique about the method is that the folding recipe is encoded into the molecule itself , through its sequence . '' explains Cody Geary , a postdoctoral scholar in the field of RNA structure and design at Aarhus University . `` The sequence of the RNAs defines both the final shape and also the series of movements that rearrange the structures as they fold . ''
`` The challenge of designing RNAs that fold up on their own is particularly difficult , since the molecules can easily get tangled during the folding process . So to design them , you really have to imagine the way that the molecules must twist and bend to obtain their final shape . '' Geary says .
The researchers used 3D models and computer software to design each RNA origami , which was then encoded as a synthetic DNA gene . Once the DNA gene was produced , simply adding the enzyme RNA-polymerase resulted in the automatic formation of RNA origami .
To observe the RNA molecules the researchers used an atomic force microscope , a type of scanning microscope that softly touches molecules instead of looking at them directly . The microscope is able to zoom in a thousand times smaller than is possible with a conventional light microscope . The researchers have demonstrated their method by folding RNA structures that form honeycomb shapes , but many other shapes should be realizable .
`` We designed the RNA molecules to fold into honeycomb patterns because they are easy to recognize in the microscope . In one experiment we caught the polymerases in the process of making the RNAs that assemble into honeycombs , and they really look like honey bees in action . '' Geary continues .
A method for making origami shapes out of DNA has been around for almost a decade , and has since created many applications for molecular scaffolds . However , RNA has some important advantages over its chemical cousin DNA that make it an attractive alternative :
Paul Rothemund , a research professor at the California Institute of Technology and the inventor of the DNA origami method , is also an author on the new RNA origami work . `` The parts for a DNA origami can not easily be written into the genome of an organism . RNA origami , on the other hand , can be represented as a DNA gene , which in cells is transcribed into RNA by a protein machine called RNA polymerase . '' explains Rothemund .
Rothemund further adds , `` The payoff is that unlike DNA origami , which are expensive and have to be made outside of cells , RNA origami should be able to be grown cheaply in large quantities , simply by growing bacteria with genes for them . Genes and bacteria cost essentially nothing to share , and so RNA origami will be easily exchanged between scientists . ''
The research was performed at laboratories at Aarhus University in Denmark , and the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena . Ebbe Andersen , an Assistant Professor at Aarhus University , who works on developing molecular biosensors , lead the development of the project .
`` All of the molecules and structures that form inside of living cells are the products of self-assembly , but we still know very little about how self-assembly actually works . By designing and testing self-assembling RNA shapes , we have begun to shed some light on fundamental principles of self-assembly . '' says Andersen .
`` The primary application for these molecular shapes is to build scaffolds for arranging other microscopic components , such as proteins , into groups that allow them to work together . For example , using the scaffolds as a foundation to build a microscopic chemical factory in which products are passed from one protein enzyme to the next . '' Andersen explains .

RNA molecules are strands that are composed of A , U , C and G nucleotides . A single strand of RNA can fold back on itself by forming base pairs , interactions between individual nucleotides in the strand . The strongest base pairs in RNA are G-C , A-U and G-U , but many other base pairs can form in RNA as well . By contrast , DNA only pairs G-C and A-T , with far fewer exceptions . As a result , RNA has a greater funtional capacity compared to DNA , but is also more difficult to engineer due to the greater complexity . In biology RNA serves a wide variety of very different roles , but is mostly known for its central role in the production of proteins . To perform these functions RNA folds up on itself and forms complicated functional shapes . By studying the architecture of the RNA molecules from nature , scientist have identified 3D modules that are defined by a patterns of A , U , C and Gs . Scientists working with RNA have shown that these modules can be used like Lego bricks .
How to design RNA origami ?
The design of RNA origamis is done with assistance from computer algorithms . The designer combines RNA helices and other 3D modules to form one interconnected strand using a 3D modeling environment . In this way the strand already has a set of sequence patterns defined , because the 3D modules constrain the sequence . Next , the strand is fed to a computer program that suggests the remaining A , U , C and Gs to assign to the rest of the structure , such that each part of the structure has a unique pattern that matches up . The program chooses the sequence from a very large space of solutions by testing many random sequences and then evaluating and comparing the energies of the base pairs from each input . After a target sequence is designed for a desired RNA , it can then be encoded into a DNA strand by a company specializing in DNA synthesis . As the price of gene synthesis continues to decrease , this allows larger and more sophisticated RNA designs to be tested . DNA genes for encoding RNA structures can be cost effective , since once the DNA for a design is synthesized it can be copied many times in the lab and even shared among researchers . When polymerase enzymes are added to the DNA genes , each copy of a DNA can be used to produce thousands of the encoded RNA structures .

Update : On Sunday , June 19 , federal police in Oaxaca fired on teachers and supporters in the Mixteca town of Nochixtl√°n , killing at least four and wounding 30 more . Another was killed in Hacienda Blanca , near Oaxaca City , according to the press service AIPIN , which also reported that people were refused care at the hospital in Nochixtl√°n . The federal government continues to refuse to talk with the CNTE . Ad Policy
On Sunday night , June 12 , as Ruben Nu√±ez , head of Oaxaca 's teachers union , was leaving a meeting in Mexico City , their car was overtaken and stopped by several large king-cab pickup trucks . Heavily armed men in civilian clothes exited and pulled him , another teacher , and a taxi driver from their cab , and then drove them at high speed to the airport . Nu√±ez was immediately flown over a thousand miles north to Hermosillo , Sonora , and dumped into a high-security federal lockup . ‚Äú Their detention is‚Ä¶a warning of what can happen to other teachers‚Ä¶ ‚Äù ‚ÄîLuis Hern√°ndez Navarro , La Jornada
Just hours earlier , unidentified armed agents did the same thing in Oaxaca itself , taking prisoner Francisco Villalobos , the union 's second-highest officer , and flying them to the Hermosillo prison as well . Villalobos was charged with having stolen textbooks a year ago . Nu√±ez 's charges are still unknown .
Both joined Aciel Sibaja , who 's been sitting in the same penitentiary since April 14 . Sibaja 's crime ? Accepting dues given voluntarily by teachers across Oaxaca . Secci√≥n 22 , the state teachers union , has had to collect dues in cash since last July , when state authorities froze not only the union 's bank accounts but even the personal ones of its officers . Sibaja was responsible for keeping track of the money teachers paid voluntarily , which the government called ‚Äú funds from illicit sources . ‚Äù
The three are not the only leaders of Oaxaca 's union in jail . Four others have been imprisoned since last October . ‚Äú The leaders of Secci√≥n 22 are hostages of the federal government , ‚Äù says Luis Hern√°ndez Navarro , a former teacher and now opinion editor for the Mexico City daily La Jornada . ‚Äú Their detention is simultaneously a warning of what can happen to other teachers who continue to reject the [ federal government 's ] ‚Äò education reform , ' and a payback to force the movement to demobilize . ‚Äù
The arrests are just one effort the Mexican government has made in recent months to stop protests . On May 19 , Education Secretary Aurelio Nu√±o Mayer announced that they were firing 3,000 teachers from Oaxaca , Guerrero , and Michoac√°n for not having worked for three days .
All three states are strongholds of the independent teachers movement within the National Union of Education Workers‚Äìthe National Coordination of Education Workers ( the CNTE , or ‚Äú Coordinadora ‚Äù ) . CNTE teachers have been striking schools since earlier this spring to stop implementation of the government 's education reform program . While strikes in Mexico are hotly contested , there is no precedent for firing teachers in such massive numbers just for striking .
The night of the firings , federal police attacked and removed the encampment that teachers had organized outside Mexico City 's education secretariat . On June 11 , the police in Oaxaca City moved to dismantle a similar encampment in front of the state 's education office . When 500 heavily armed police advanced shooting tear gas , confrontations spilled into the surrounding streets , reminiscent of the way a similar strike in 2006 was attacked , and then mushroomed into an insurrection that lasted for months . One measure could end the system of teacher training schools , which have been hotbeds of social protest for decades .
One controversial provision of the federal government 's education reform requires teachers to take tests to evaluate their qualifications . Those not making good marks are subject to firing . This year , when the government tried to begin testing , teachers struck in protest .
In March , when Nu√±o tried to give awards to ‚Äú distinguished and excellent teachers , ‚Äù one of them , Lucero Navarette , a primary-school teacher in Chihuahua , told him , ‚Äú The results can depend on many factors and the personal circumstances each one of us live through‚Ä¶many do n't get the result they deserve , because the job they actually do at school is very different from what comes out in the test. ‚Äù Journalist Hern√°ndez Navarro says educators have a tradition of egalitarianism and mutual support , and believe that ‚Äú there are no first- or second- or third-class teachers . Only teachers. ‚Äù Similar measures have been advocated by a Washington think tank , with funding from USAID .
On March 22 Nu√±o also announced a measure that would spell the end to Mexico 's national system of teacher training schools , called the ‚Äú normals. ‚Äù Instead of having to graduate from a normal , they said , anyone with a college degree in any subject could be hired to teach . Since the Mexican Revolution and before , the normals have been the vehicle for children from poor families in the countryside , and from the families of teachers themselves , to become trained educators . Returning to rural and working-class communities , teachers then often play an important role in developing movements for social justice . The normal schools themselves have historically been hotbeds of social protest and movements challenging the government . LIKE THIS ? GET MORE OF OUR BEST REPORTING AND ANALYSIS
Guerrero 's normal school in Ayotzinapa was the target two years ago of an attack that led to the disappearance and possible murder of 43 students , which has since galvanized Mexico . Recently a commission of international experts criticized the Mexican government for refusing to cooperate in efforts to identify the fate of the students , and pointed to the possible involvement of officials at very high levels in their disappearance .
Firing teachers and disbanding the normals is a not-so-hidden goal of the federal education reform . The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development has called for abolishing the normal schools , and urged President Enrique Pe√±a Nieto to fire teachers who get bad test results and exclude them from teaching . Similar measures have been advocated by a Washington think tank , the Partnership for Educational Revitalization in the Americas , a project of the Inter-American Dialogue with funding from USAID .
Both organizations work in cooperation with the corporate Mexican education reform lobby , Mexicanos Primero , headed Claudio Gonz√°lez Guajardo , a member of one of the country 's wealthiest families . Gonz√°lez instructed Pe√±a Nieto that ‚Äú Mexicans elected you , not the [ teachers ] union , ‚Äù and told them to ‚Äú end the power of the union over hiring , promotion , pay , and benefits for teachers . ‚Äù
Oaxaca has become a target because Secci√≥n 22 proposed its own alternative education reform over six years ago , which concentrated on respecting indigenous culture and forging alliances between teachers , students , parents , and their communities ( for more on the alternative reform proposals and the corporate sector 's attacks on teachers , see ‚Äú US-Style School Reform Goes South ) ‚Äù ) . After the insurrection of 2006 , the union became the backbone of the left 's effort to defeat the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party ( PRI ) , and in 2010 Oaxacans for the first time elected a non-PRI governor , Gabino Cu√© . Owing their election to the teachers , Cu√© agreed to begin implementing their reform instead of the federal one .
In 2012 , however , the PRI regained control of the federal government . Under its pressure , Cu√© reneged on their commitment to Oaxaca 's teachers and announced that they would implement the federal reforms instead . Protests started immediately , and have escalated since then .
With the left in Oaxaca badly divided , the PRI regained control of the state government as well in voting on June 6 . The arrests of the two top leaders of Secci√≥n 22 followed in less than a week .
Since the 1970s , when over 100 teachers were murdered during the years when the Coordinadora was organized , the CNTE has won control of the union in Oaxaca , Guerrero , and Michoac√°n , and it has a strong presence in several other states . Nationally , it has become an important base of the Mexican left . It is one of the most powerful opponents of the government 's embrace of free-market and free-trade policies . Weakening the union and the role of teachers in politics is therefore an important political goal for Gonz√°lez and Mexico 's corporate elite , as well as the national political parties moving the country to the right .
When Hern√°ndez Navarro calls the leaders of Secci√≥n 22 hostages , it 's no exaggeration . On June 11 , President Pe√±a Nieto announced that they would only talk with the teachers if they agreed to two conditions . ‚Äú The Government of the Republic repeats that it is open to dialogue only when they comply with two conditions : returning to work in the schools of Chiapas , Guerrero , Michoac√°n , and Oaxaca , and accepting the Education Reform . ‚Äù
Taking union leaders hostage , firing thousands , and closing one of Mexico 's most progressive institutions are serious violations of human and labor rights , and of the rule of law itself . The support the corporate-friendly Mexican reforms get from US political institutions makes it incumbent on those institutions to speak out against these violations as well . It is time to stop that support . Instead , teachers in the United States , who are resisting similar reforms , should stand in solidarity and help free their Mexican colleagues , which would give them some breathing room as they continue their fight .
Between 2008 and 2016 , in net terms , the Australian labour market expanded by 474,000 full-time jobs . But only 74,000 of them went to people born in Australia . That 's fewer than one in six .
That 's not because the Australian-born are a small minority . Two-thirds of all working-age residents of this country were born here . Yet roughly three-quarters of the growth in full-time jobs since the global financial crisis has gone to recent migrants .
I am unambiguously pro-immigration , but if the level and nature of the immigration are not working for us , I suggest we turn down the tap .
Australian Bureau of Statistics figures ignored by analysts reveal that of those 474,000 new full-time jobs , in net terms , 364,000 have been filled by migrants who have arrived in Australia since 2001 ‚Äì most of them since the GFC .
It is a stunning demonstration of why the Turnbull government had no choice yesterday but to flag the replacement of the 457 visa program , under which many of those migrants have arrived here . They have come from all parts of the world , but almost half are from one part : the Indian subcontinent . While only a net 74,000 full-time jobs have been generated since 2008 for workers born in Australia , a staggering 168,000 of them have been generated for workers born in India and its neighbours .
Source : Australian Bureau of Statistics . Numbers rounded to the nearest a thousand or 1 per cent . Recent migrants defined as those who say they have been in Australia less than fifteen years , older migrants as those who say they have been here fifteen years or more .
Some of those workers arrived here originally as students , but found ways to stay on in Australia , whether they are working as doctors and engineers or as taxi drivers , on late-night shifts at service stations or as kitchen hands in Indian restaurants . But many came here on 457 visas , brought out by employers who have been allowed to run their own immigration programs , with relatively little oversight by government .
The widespread flaws in the scheme have been meticulously documented by Bob Birrell and their colleagues at the Australian Population Research Institute , but generally ignored in the policy debate . Many on the left and centre-left seem to be uncomfortable with the idea that there can be such a thing as too much immigration .
I am unambiguously pro-immigration , but if the level and nature of the immigration are not working for us , I suggest we turn down the tap . That was the way immigration policy was run in the Menzies era . When the economy slowed , ministers turned down the tap of immigration flows , reducing numbers to avoid flooding the market . We need to do that now .
The 457 visas are only one part of the problem . Despite the clear downturn in the labour market since 2012 , the federal government has maintained a target of 190,000 permanent migrants a year , two-thirds of them skilled migrants . We have more than half a million foreign students who are free to work , and at any time there are tens of thousands of visitors here on working holidays .
But the 457 visas have been so rorted by unscrupulous employers that they are now a damaged brand . Case after case has been exposed in which workers were mistreated , were not paid the wages required by law , or were employed in different jobs from those stated . There was minimal supervision by government , and it was all too easy for workers to convert their visa into permanent residency .
Bureau figures show that in the decade to June 2015 , 371,000 ‚Äú temporary workers , ‚Äù plus their families , arrived here on 457 visas , sponsored by business , ostensibly to fill jobs that could not be filled by Australians . Yet over that decade , only 145,000 of those on 457 visas left Australia to return home . Roughly 60 per cent of them , 226,000 , stayed in Australia , mostly swapping their temporary visa for permanent residency .
They want to improve their lives , and you ca n't blame anyone for that . And if there 's room for them in the labour market , and they 're not costing our own kids jobs , then good luck to them .
But analysis of the labour market data shows that 's not the case . Between 2008 and 2016 , the number of Australian-born workers who were unemployed swelled by more than half , from 338,000 to 507,000 . The number of them in full-time jobs grew by only 1 per cent . The number unemployed and looking for full-time work grew by 54 per cent .
In particular , between 2008 and 2016 , the number of fifteen-to-twenty-four-year-old school , college and university leavers who have a full-time job shrank by a massive 214,000 , or 21 per cent . Sure , many stayed longer in full-time education . But the number of education leavers in part-time work jumped by 29 per cent , while the number unemployed shot up 36 per cent . They are the victims of a system that encourages employers to bring in skilled workers from overseas rather than hire and train them here .
That sums up in a nutshell why Malcolm Turnbull and Peter Dutton had to move yesterday to pledge that 457 visas will be replaced next year by two visas setting tougher conditions , including a requirement that employers must look for workers locally before seeking permission to import them .
The key changes are that :
‚Ä¢ A new two-tier system will be introduced from March 2018 , with one class of temporary workers given four-year visas with a pathway to permanent residency , and the other allowed two-year visas with a pathway just to a second two-year visa .
‚Ä¢ Employers will be required to advertise first for workers in Australia , unless they bring workers from a country with a trade agreement that rules that out .
‚Ä¢ Workers will have to show they have two years ' work experience , and pass a criminal history check .
‚Ä¢ Employers using the 457 visa scheme will have to pay a training levy for Australian workers , with the details to be announced in the budget .
There are many questions to be answered and details to be filled in before we know how the new scheme will work . While the prime minister made much of the reduced occupations allowed to use the scheme , there are still some 400 of them ‚Äì and they include all the main occupations for which 457 visas are now issued . Labor points out that the 216 occupations removed from the list would exclude less than 9 per cent of current visa holders .
What labour-market testing will be required ? In what ways will the bar be set higher for issuing four-year visas with permanent residency rights , compared with the two-year visas , which exclude permanent residency ?
And , most crucially , what resources will be devoted to ensuring that employers are abiding by the conditions of the new visas : using their staff for the duties they nominated , paying them the agreed wage , and so on ? One reason why 457 visas developed into such a rort was that the federal government failed to police them . Employers who exploited their 457 workers seemed to be more at risk of being exposed by Fairfax 's Adele Ferguson and their colleagues than by the immigration authorities .
The key occupations that dominate the program will still be allowed in the replacement scheme : cooks , chefs and restaurant managers ; ICT business analysts , programmers and software engineers ; and the amorphous occupations of marketing specialists , sales and marketing managers , customer service managers , and so on .
Between them , over the past two years , just twelve occupations in these three areas accounted for more than a third of the visas granted . All of them are on the new lists . What difference will the tougher conditions really make when the new system takes effect ? We 'll have to wait and see . But the key changes are good ones ; if they do work in the way the ministers implied they would , they would help restore a balance that has been missing in immigration policy for years .
It 's not an encouraging sign that Turnbull and Dutton yesterday played it for political ends . Repeatedly , their statements were misleading or flatly wrong . The 457 visa was introduced by the Howard government , not ( as they implied ) by Labor . Bill Shorten , whom Turnbull called the Olympic champion in issuing visas , did n't issue any at all ; they were not the immigration minister . Labor in office tightened the rules of the scheme to reduce rorts ‚Äì a crackdown the Coalition , and Turnbull personally , opposed .
Until recently , the Coalition 's only changes to the scheme have been to weaken its controls . It rejected advice from its own taskforce to set up an independent monitor to carry out labour-market testing , and to reduce the number of occupations using the scheme . It ca n't claim credit for the fall in the number of visas issued ; everything it did in office was designed to increase them .
The government has gradually changed tack since Peter Dutton became minister , and yesterday 's announcement makes it much clearer . But how much difference the new scheme will really make remains to be seen .
It is important to remember that the 457 visa was designed to bring in skilled workers . Of the 94,890 visa holders at 30 June last year , 55 per cent were in occupations judged as requiring the top level of skills , and 98 per cent were in the top three levels .
Yes , there are ridiculous examples of workers being brought in on 457 visas to do entry-level jobs . But the bigger danger is that it closes off avenues for young Australians to develop careers in occupations requiring skills : in restaurants , in IT , in management , even in medicine , where , as Mike Moynihan and Bob Birrell have pointed out , the open door to migrant doctors has added to a glut of GPs in the cities without providing more than a temporary respite for the shortage in country towns .
The table below , contrasting the experiences of recent migrants and the Australian-born , highlights our predicament . By making it so easy for employers to hire their skilled workforce overseas rather than face the expense of training Australians , we have closed off opportunities for young Australians to move up the ladder and gain the skills and experience that will allow them a good future .
Source : Australian Bureau of Statistics . Numbers rounded to the nearest a thousand or 1 per cent . Recent migrants defined as those who say they have been in Australia less than fifteen years , older migrants as those who say they have been here fifteen years or more .
Our future depends on Australians developing the skills to maintain a high-income , technologically advanced country in an increasingly competitive world . We made a mistake in following the US model of importing skilled labour and leaving the young in the rustbelt to scrape by as best they can . There are many reasons why our migrant workers are not generating enough demand to replace the jobs they have taken : what is clear is that our current system is not working for those who were born and raised here .
Fewer than one-in-six new full-time jobs , in net terms , now go to Australian-born workers . It 's not anti-migrant , let alone racist , to say that that is an outrageous failure of policy . May yesterday 's announcement be the first step towards putting it right . ‚Ä¢

Let 's look at how to create a RESTFul API for our Django Talk Project using Django Rest Framework ( DRF ) , which is an application used for rapidly building RESTful APIs based on Django models .
Put another way , we 'll be converting a non-RESTful application into a RESTful one with DRF . We 'll be using DRF version 2.4.2 for this application .
This tutorial covers these topics :
DRF Setup RESTful Structure Model Serializer DRF Web Browseable API

If you missed parts one and two of this tutorial series , be sure to check them out . Need the code ? Download it from the repo . For a more in-depth tutorial on Django Rest Framework , check out the third Real Python course .
DRF setup
Install :
$ pip install djangorestframework $ pip freeze > requirements.txt
Update settings.py :
INSTALLED_APPS = ( 'django.contrib.admin ' , 'django.contrib.auth ' , 'django.contrib.contenttypes ' , 'django.contrib.sessions ' , 'django.contrib.messages ' , 'django.contrib.staticfiles ' , 'talk ' , 'rest_framework ' )
Boom !
RESTful Structure
In a RESTful API , endpoints ( URLs ) define the structure of the API and how end users access data from our application using the HTTP methods : GET , POST , PUT , DELETE . Endpoints should be logically organized around collections and elements , both of which are resources . In our case , we have one single resource , posts , so we will use the following URLS - /posts/ and /posts/ < id > for collections and elements , respectively .
GET POST PUT DELETE /posts/ Show all posts Add new post Update all posts Delete all posts /posts/ < id > Show < id > N/A Update < id > Delete id
DRF Quick Start
Let 's get our new API up and running !
Model Serializer
DRF 's Serializers convert model instances to Python dictionaires , which can then be rendered in various API appropriate formats - like JSON or XML . Similar to the Django ModelForm class , DRF comes with a concise format for its Serializers , the ModelSerializer class . It 's simple to use : Just tell it which fields you want to use from the model :
from rest_framework import serializers from talk.models import Post class PostSerializer ( serializers . ModelSerializer ) : class Meta : model = Post fields = ( 'id ' , 'author ' , 'text ' , 'created ' , 'updated ' )
Save this as serializers.py within the ‚Äú talk ‚Äù directory .
We need to refactor our current views to fit the RESTful paradigm . Comment out the current views and add in :
from django.shortcuts import render from django.http import HttpResponse from rest_framework.decorators import api_view from rest_framework.response import Response from talk.models import Post from talk.serializers import PostSerializer from talk.forms import PostForm def home ( request ) : tmpl_vars = { 'form ' : PostForm ( ) } return render ( request , 'talk/index.html ' , tmpl_vars ) @ api_view ( [ 'GET ' ] ) def post_collection ( request ) : if request . method == 'GET ' : posts = Post . objects . all ( ) serializer = PostSerializer ( posts , many = True ) return Response ( serializer . data ) @ api_view ( [ 'GET ' ] ) def post_element ( request , pk ) : try : post = Post . objects . get ( pk = pk ) except Post . DoesNotExist : return HttpResponse ( status = 404 ) if request . method == 'GET ' : serializer = PostSerializer ( post ) return Response ( serializer . data )
What 's happening here :
First , the @ api_view decorator checks that the appropriate HTTP request is passed into the view function . Right now , we 're only supporting GET requests . Then , the view either grabs all the data , if it 's for the collection , or just a single post , if it 's for an element . Finally , the data is serialized to JSON and returned .
Be sure to read more about the @ api_view from the official documentation .
Let 's wire up some new URLs :
# Talk urls from django.conf.urls import patterns , url urlpatterns = patterns ( 'talk.views ' , url ( r '^ $ ' , 'home ' ) , # api url ( r '^api/v1/posts/ $ ' , 'post_collection ' ) , url ( r '^api/v1/posts/ ( ? P < pk > [ 0-9 ] + ) $ ' , 'post_element ' ) )
Test
We 're now ready for our first test !
Fire up the server , then navigate to : http : //127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/posts/ ? format=json . Now let 's check out the Browsable API . Navigate to http : //127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/posts/ So , With no extra work on our end we automatically get this nice , human-readable output of our API . Nice ! This is a huge win for DRF . How about an element ? Try : http : //127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/posts/1
Before moving on you may have noticed that the author field is an id rather than the actual username . We 'll address this shortly . For now , let 's wire up our new API so that it works with our current application 's Templates .
Refactor for REST
GET
On the initial page load , we want to display all posts . To do that , add the following AJAX request :
load_posts ( ) // Load all posts on page load function load_posts ( ) { $ . ajax ( { url : `` api/v1/posts/ '' , // the endpoint type : `` GET '' , // http method // handle a successful response success : function ( json ) { for ( var i = 0 ; i < json . length ; i ++ ) { console . log ( json [ i ] ) $ ( `` # talk '' ) . prepend ( `` < li id='post- '' + json [ i ] . id + `` ' > < strong > '' + json [ i ] . text + `` < /strong > - < em > `` + json [ i ] . author + `` < /em > - < span > `` + json [ i ] . created + `` < /span > - < a id='delete-post- '' + json [ i ] . id + `` ' > delete me < /a > < /li > '' ) ; } } , // handle a non-successful response error : function ( xhr , errmsg , err ) { $ ( ' # results ' ) . html ( `` < div class='alert-box alert radius ' data-alert > Oops ! We have encountered an error : `` + errmsg + `` < a href= ' # ' class='close ' > √ó < /a > < /div > '' ) ; // add the error to the dom console . log ( xhr . status + `` : `` + xhr . responseText ) ; // provide a bit more info about the error to the console } } ) ; } ;
You 've seen all this before . Notice how we 're handling a success : Since the API sends back a number of objects , we need to iterate through them , appending each to the DOM . We also changed json [ i ] .postpk to json [ i ] .id as we are serializing the post id .
Test this out . Fire up the server , log in , then check out the posts .
Besides the author being displayed as an id , take note of the datetime format . This is not what we want , right ? We want a readable datetime format . Let 's update that‚Ä¶
We can use an awesome JavaScript library called MomentJS to easily format the date anyway we want .
First , we need to import the library to our index.html file :
< ! -- scripts -- > < script src = `` http : //cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/moment.js/2.8.2/moment.min.js '' > < / script > < script src = `` static/scripts/main.js '' > < / script >
Then update the for loop in main.js :
for ( var i = 0 ; i < json . length ; i ++ ) { dateString = convert_to_readable_date ( json [ i ] . created ) $ ( `` # talk '' ) . prepend ( `` < li id='post- '' + json [ i ] . id + `` ' > < strong > '' + json [ i ] . text + `` < /strong > - < em > `` + json [ i ] . author + `` < /em > - < span > `` + dateString + `` < /span > - < a id='delete-post- '' + json [ i ] . id + `` ' > delete me < /a > < /li > '' ) ; }
Here we pass the date string to a new function called convert_to_readable_date ( ) , which needs to be added :
// convert ugly date to human readable date function convert_to_readable_date ( date_time_string ) { var newDate = moment ( date_time_string ) . format ( 'MM/DD/YYYY , h : mm : ss a ' ) return newDate }
That 's it . Refresh the browser . The datetime format should now look something like this - 08/22/2014 , 6:48:29 pm . Be sure to check out the MomentJS documentation to view more information on parsing and formatting a datetime string in JavaScript .
POST
POST requests are handled in similar fashion . Before messing with the serializer , let 's test it first by just updating the views . Maybe we 'll get lucky and it will just work .
Update the post_collection ( ) function in views.py :
@ api_view ( [ 'GET ' , 'POST ' ] ) def post_collection ( request ) : if request . method == 'GET ' : posts = Post . objects . all ( ) serializer = PostSerializer ( posts , many = True ) return Response ( serializer . data ) elif request . method == 'POST ' : data = { 'text ' : request . DATA . get ( 'the_post ' ) , 'author ' : request . user . pk } serializer = PostSerializer ( data = data ) if serializer . is_valid ( ) : serializer . save ( ) return Response ( serializer . data , status = status . HTTP_201_CREATED ) return Response ( serializer . errors , status = status . HTTP_400_BAD_REQUEST )
Also add the following import :
from rest_framework import status
What 's happening here :
request.DATA extends Django 's HTTPRequest , returning the content from the request body . Read more about it here . If the deserialization process works , we return a response with a code of 201 ( created ) . On the other hand , if the deserialization process fails , we return a 400 response .
Update the endpoint in the creation_post ( ) function
From :
url : `` create_post/ '' , // the endpoint
To :
url : `` api/v1/posts/ '' , // the endpoint
Test it out in the browser . It should work . Do n't forget to update the handling of the dates correctly as well as changing json.postpk to json.id :
success : function ( json ) { $ ( ' # post-text ' ) . val ( `` ) ; // remove the value from the input console . log ( json ) ; // log the returned json to the console dateString = convert_to_readable_date ( json . created ) $ ( `` # talk '' ) . prepend ( `` < li id='post- '' + json . id + `` ' > < strong > '' + json . text + `` < /strong > - < em > `` + json . author + `` < /em > - < span > `` + dateString + `` < /span > - < a id='delete-post- '' + json . id + `` ' > delete me < /a > < /li > '' ) ; console . log ( `` success '' ) ; // another sanity check } ,
Author Format
Now 's a good time to pause and address the author id vs. username issue . We have a few options :
Be really RESTFUL and make another call to get the user info , which is not good for performance . Utilize the SlugRelatedField relation .
Let 's go with the latter option . Update the serializer :
from django.contrib.auth.models import User from rest_framework import serializers from talk.models import Post class PostSerializer ( serializers . ModelSerializer ) : author = serializers . SlugRelatedField ( queryset = User . objects . all ( ) , slug_field = 'username ' ) class Meta : model = Post fields = ( 'id ' , 'author ' , 'text ' , 'created ' , 'updated ' )
What 's happening here ?
The SlugRelatedField allows us to change the target of the author field from id to username . Also , by default the target field - username - is both readable and writeable so out-of-the-box this relation will work for both GET and POST requests .
Update the data variable in the views as well :
data = { 'text ' : request . DATA . get ( 'the_post ' ) , 'author ' : request . user }
Test again . You should now see the author 's username . Make sure both GET and POST requests are working correctly .
Delete
Before changing or adding anything , test it out . Try the delete link . What happens ? You should get a 404 error . Any idea why that would be ? Or where to go to find out what the issue is ? How about the delete_post function in our JavaScript file :
url : `` delete_post/ '' , // the endpoint
That URL does not exist . Before we update it , ask yourself - ‚Äú Should we target the collection or an individual element ? ‚Äù . If you 're unsure , scroll back up and look at the RESTful Structure table . Unless we want to delete all posts , then we need to hit the element endpoint :
url : `` api/v1/posts/ '' + post_primary_key , // the endpoint
Test again . Now what happens ? You should see a 405 error - 405 : { `` detail '' : `` Method 'DELETE ' not allowed . '' } - since the view is not setup to handle a DELETE request .
@ api_view ( [ 'GET ' , 'DELETE ' ] ) def post_element ( request , pk ) : try : post = Post . objects . get ( pk = pk ) except Post . DoesNotExist : return HttpResponse ( status = 404 ) if request . method == 'GET ' : serializer = PostSerializer ( post ) return Response ( serializer . data ) elif request . method == 'DELETE ' : post . delete ( ) return Response ( status = status . HTTP_204_NO_CONTENT )
With the DELETE HTTP verb added , we can handle the request by removing the post with to delete ( ) method and returning a 204 response . Does it work ? Only one way to find out . This time when you test make sure that ( a ) the post is actually deleted and removed from the DOM and ( b ) that a 204 status code is returned ( you can confirm this in the Network tab within Chrome Developer Tools ) .
Conclusion and Next Steps
Free Bonus : Click here to download a copy of the `` REST API Examples '' Guide and get a hands-on introduction to Python + REST API principles with actionable examples .
This is all for now . Need an extra challenge ? Add the ability to update posts with the PUT request .
The actual REST part is simple : You just need to update the post_element ( ) function to handle PUT requests .
The client side is a bit more difficult as you need to update the actual HTML to display an input box for the user to enter the new value in , which you 'll need to grab in the JavaScript file so you can send it with the PUT request .
Are you going to allow any user to update any post , regardless of whether s/he originally posted it ?
If so , are you going to update the author name ? Maybe add an edited_by field to the database ? Then display an edited by note on the DOM as well . If users can only update their own posts , you need to make sure you are handling this correctly in the views and then displaying an error message if the user is trying to edit a post that s/he did not originally post .
Or perhaps you could just remove the edit link ( and perhaps the delete link as well ) for posts that a certain user ca n't edit . You could turn it into a permissions issue and only let certain users , like moderators or admin , edit all posts while the remaining users can only update their own posts .
So many questions .
If you do decide to try this , go with the lowest hanging fruit‚Äîsimply allow any user to update any post and only update the text in the database . Then test . Then add another iteration . Then test , etc . Take notes and email us at info @ realpython.com so we can add a supplementary blog post !
Anyhow , next time you 'll get to see us tear apart the current JavaScript code as we add in Angular ! See you then .
At today 's First Minister 's Questions , the Scottish Labour leader Kezia Dugdale oddly chose to spend their entire allotted time not on any current issues affecting Scotland , but on attacking the SNP 's 2013 White Paper on independence , seemingly unaware that the referendum was held 14 months ago and resulted in a win for the No side .
Happily for Scotland , that decision resulted in a huge ¬£200bn oil bonanza .
Hang on , let 's just double-check that to be sure .
We can surely all agree that Scotland dodged a bullet there by placing its trust in Ms Dugdale and their ‚Äú Better Together ‚Äù chums . The oil and gas industry must be breathing a sigh of relief and thanks that it had the broad shoulders of the UK protecting it at this difficult and volatile time .
Clint Hill signs one-year contract extension
Defender extends stay until 2016
Hill has made 170 appearances for QPR in five-years
FANS ' favourite Clint Hill has signed a new contract at Loftus Road .
The popular 36 year old , who joined QPR in the summer of 2010 , has today ( Friday ) put pen to paper on a one year extension .
Hill , who has made 170 appearances in all competitions for the R 's in the last five years , is excited about extending their stay in W12 into a sixth year , commenting : ‚Äú Everyone knows what QPR means to me and I am delighted to be part of the new philosophy that 's filtering through the club . It 's exciting times , and there 's been a lot of good work done behind the scenes .
‚Äú My longevity has surprised me ‚Äì and it 's probably surprised a few others as well . But I 've looked after myself well over the years , and I 'm still going somehow !
‚Äú This season I want to remain fit and put pressure on players that are in the team . I want to set standards in training and prove to myself that I can still do this .
‚Äú Professionally , this is the longest I have been at any club and I have thoroughly enjoyed my time here . There have been a few down-turns along the way , but as a team and as a club we have always reacted to them , and bounced back . I hope we can do the same again this year . ‚Äù
SIGNED-UP : Clint Hill in pre-season training this week
QPR Director of Football , Les Ferdinand , believes Hill still has plenty to offer , telling www.qpr.co.uk : ‚Äú Clint is a QPR man and the more players you can have on your books that understand what the club is all about , the better .
‚Äú He 's a fantastic professional , who gives everything for the shirt , and we 're delighted he 's agreed this new deal .
‚Äú His influence around the training ground will be invaluable for the existing group of players , but perhaps more importantly for the new players joining us . ‚Äù

Last week , DGR co-founder Derrick Jensen interviewed Janine Blaeloch on Resistance Radio .
Listen here ( Firefox sometimes does n't work with this link ‚Äì try another browser )
Blaeloch is founder and director of the Western Lands Project . They earned a degree in Environmental Studies ( B.A. , University of Washington ) , with a self-designed program focusing on Public Lands Management and Policy . Janine has been a public-land activist since 1985 . They worked as an environmental planner in both the private and public sectors before founding WLP in 1997 . They talk about efforts to stop the giving away of public lands to large corporations , among other things .
Here is a description of the Western Lands Project :
Western Lands Project fights public land privatization in order to protect the environment and the public interest . Our mission is to scrutinize public land trades , sales , giveaways , and any project that would cede public land , and their impacts on habitat and wildlife , natural resources , land use , and communities . Our goal is to keep public land public .
Each year , approximately 200 land deals are proposed by the Bureau of Land Management and Forest Service , in addition to those introduced by legislation . Western Lands Project scrutinizes them all , challenging those that threaten wildlife , natural resources , open space , and the public interest .
We rely on project monitoring , policy/agency reform , public education and empowerment , legal challenges , and advocacy . Since our founding in 1997 , this multifaceted strategy has proven successful in defending public lands from privatization . By fighting harmful land deals on the ground and by working to improve top-down policies , we are able to tailor an effective and focused response to all kinds of privatization schemes .
WSJ A screenshot of a cinematic section on the iPhone version of ‚Äú The Walking Dead ‚Äù
It seems we have more evidence that the iPhone has come of age as a true gaming platform ‚Äî sitting next to the Xbox and other consoles ‚Äî thanks to the zombie apocalypse .
Telltale Games , a venture-backed San Francisco-based startup , appears to be making money hand-over-fist for a cinematic game called ‚Äú The Walking Dead , ‚Äù based on the comic series . Many game-review outlets ‚Äî such as Wired , Spike TV and Metacritic ‚Äî have declared it the ‚Äú game of the year ‚Äù for its storytelling and choose-your-own-adventure style .
But beyond the reviews is a surging business . Telltale sells the game in ‚Äú episodes ‚Äù ‚Äî five in all ‚Äî for multiple gaming platforms : the Xbox 360 , PS3 , PC and the iPhone/iPad , where it 's especially resonating with swipe- and touch-based mechanics .
The biggest video game convention of the year always starts off the same : Several of the major players in the industry , from Microsoft and Sony to EA and Ubisoft , hold big stage events at the outset , showing off some of their biggest announcements , trotting out speakers and third-party partners , and showing off the best CGI trailers you 'll see all year .
There are awkward moments , pauses for applause , and occasionally some really genuine excitement in the crowd , which is comprised largely of industry people and press . These are n't intimate settings , with pointed Q & A ; they 're presentations designed to entertain and create hype .
They 're also dinosaurs , archaic remnants of a time before internet streaming services made it easier to attend these events online than in person , when the press in attendance had to convey what was said and shown back to their readers . Before Twitch and YouTube streaming made these conferences available for mass consumption .
I asked President and chief operating officer of Nintendo of America , Reggie Fils-Aime , why Nintendo abandoned the format .
`` My first E3 was ten years ago , '' they tell me , `` and ten years ago YouTube and Twitch did n't exist . Ten years ago you could actually get media to pay attention . '' Now , they say , everyone 's typing away on their laptops and smartphones . And more people are watching the conferences online than in person by orders of magnitude .
Nintendo has n't exactly been known for blazing new trails with online technology . It was n't until the Wii U that the company really created a viable alternative to PlayStation Network and Xbox Live . Now the Miiverse is widely seen as a good third option , with many of its own unique innovations .
When it comes to big press events like E3 , Nintendo is simply reading the writing on the wall .
`` We 're reflecting the current realities , '' Fils-Aime tells me .
Nintendo began their E3 presence with what they 've dubbed a `` digital event . '' I mistakenly refer to it as a Nintendo Direct -- -the video game maker 's usual method for making announcements and bringing consumers up to date on their games -- -and Fils-Aime is quick to point out that the two are not the same thing .
For one thing , it 's humorous . There 's a sense of story-telling throughout that is n't present in the more straightforward Nintendo Directs . But however different the two may be , the digital event stands out in stark contrast to the press conferences of Sony and Microsoft . There 's no audience , no cheering or awkward silences . Everyone at E3 and everyone not at E3 is participating in the same event in the same way .
And it allows Nintendo to be in control , avoiding any technical problems or other hiccups , and allowing them to just do something funny . Fils-Aime points out that `` we could n't have a video like the one with myself and Iwata in a press conference . ''
He 's referring to this pretty hilarious video of themselves and Nintendo President and CEO Satoru Iwata promoting Super Smash Bros. for the Wii U :
Following the Digital Event , Nintendo has opened up E3 to consumers across the world through their Treehouse format , which shows a continual livestream of Nintendo 's offerings at E3 , whether that 's a Super Smash Bros. tournament , or developers explaining their games .
Rather than closed-doors demos open only to the press , Nintendo has opened up the format entirely . And rather than just a handful of CGI trailers for the masses and then show-floor hands-on time for attendees , the Treehouse format allows people all over the world to get a really intimate look at these games and their actual gameplay .
You can watch the Treehouse broadcast on Twitch or YouTube . It 's a pretty remarkable way to get a glimpse -- -though it 's much more than just a glimpse -- -at Nintendo 's presence at E3 . For that matter , you can watch it right here , too , and share it with friends :
Nintendo has been criticized as being out of touch . Their absence from E3 press conferences was seen as a big mistake by many . But if E3 2014 is any indication , Nintendo is stealing the show .
Not only did the Digital Event reveal a lot of neat looking games -- -and some not-so-neat looking games -- -it was a smooth presentation and it did n't end when the 40 minutes were up , extending on throughout the conference via the Treehouse streaming , blending the live in-person side of E3 with the much , much larger internet audience .
While I do n't think Sony and Microsoft will be abandoning their press conferences anytime soon , I would n't be surprised at all to see an E3 2015 that was as organized and online for these companies using the Nintendo model .
Showing off competitive games like Splatoon and Super Smash Bros. on Twitch during E3 just makes sense . It taps into the eSports craze and brings game news and footage directly to consumers without having to rely on middle men .
Just like the future of game distribution will eventually go digital , the future of video game conferences will be live streams -- -not to replace hands-on and in-person experiences , but to augment them .

Hundreds of protesters chanted , `` Let them in '' outside Terminal 4 at JFK Airport on Saturday , Jan. 28 , 2017 . View Full Caption DNAinfo/Irene Plagianos
NEW YORK CITY ‚Äî President Donald Trump 's ban on travelers from seven predominantly Muslim countries led to the detention of several people flying into John F. Kennedy Airport on Saturday , officials said .
Hundreds of people gathered at the airport throughout the day to protest Trump 's order and to demand that those detained be released .
Trump 's executive order signed on Friday blocked entry for all refugees from Syria indefinitely , and refugees from other countries for 120 days , but also temporarily halted entry to New Yorkers and others with legal permanent resident status who come from one of the seven countries . Those countries are Iran , Iraq , Libya , Somalia , Sudan , Syria and Yemen .
The family of a 66-year-old Yemeni matriarch , Amena , a green card holder who was flying in Saturday from Saudi Arabia to live with their son Ahmed and their wife , waited anxiously in the airport 's Terminal 1 to see if they would be allowed to stay or be sent back . They declined to give their last names for fear of reprisals .
`` I feel scared , we all feel insecure , '' said Mohamed , 26 , Amena 's nephew who is now a citizen . `` I hate to see people divided . I would never , never expect to see an old woman treated like this in New York . ''
Ali , a 78-year-old Iranian man and green card holder who has lived with their daughter Atousa in Connecticut for the last 15 years , was detained for more than 7 hours before being released .
`` We came here from Iran for freedom and democracy , '' said Atousa , who declined to give their last name . `` We wanted to live here , in the states , and this is what happens . I ca n't understand . I ca n't understand . ''
Them brother , who also has a green card , was still detained Saturday night .
Ali , translated through their daughter , had a message for Donald Trump : `` Do n't create problems , solve them . ''
Among the other travelers held were two Iraqi men who said they feared terrorist retribution for helping American military efforts in Baghdad , according to a writ filed in Brooklyn Federal Court seeking their release .
Haider Sameer Abdulkhaleq Alshawi , 34 , and Hameed Khalid Darweesh , 53 , arrived at the airport Friday night with the goal of settling in the U.S. with their families under special visas designed to protect Iraqis who faced threats for helping the military effort in Iraq and Afghanistan .
Darweesh was released Saturday afternoon and Alshawi was released later that night . Federal officials said that 11 other refugees were still being detained at JFK by Department of Homeland Security 's division of Customs and Border Protection . They did not immediately respond to confirm that number .

Darweesh , a trained electrical engineer and father of three , worked extensively with the United States government and military in Iraq for 10 years as an interpreter , engineer and contractor , according to a Writ of Habeas Corpus filed in Brooklyn Federal Court . They were heading to North Carolina with their family , who were not detained .
`` He was released because it 's totally arbitrary , '' said Becca Heller , a lawyer with the International Refugee Assistant Project . `` He got very , very lucky . ''

Alshawi worked as an accountant with a military contractor , the Falcon Security Group , in Baghdad and had lost a family member to insurgent attacks . They were coming to join their wife and son , who live in Texas .
`` I 've been speaking with their wife and she 's very emotional , '' said their lawyer , Julie Kornfield . `` She 's been up all night . ''
Lawyers for the two men said they were prevented from speaking to their clients while in detention .
When they asked who they should talk to , they were told `` Mr. President . Call Mr. Trump , '' according to the account in court papers .
Alshawi , who was released about 7 p.m. , said they were relieved to be out . They feared returning to Baghdad where they faced constant threats and was forced to regularly check their car for bombs .
They looked forward to reuniting with their wife and son , who they had n't seen since 2014 .
`` When I see my son I 'm going to hug them for a very long time , '' they said .
On Saturday afternoon , U.S . Representatives Nydia Valazquez and Jerry Nadler claimed credit for the release of Darweesh after meeting with officials at Customs and Board Protection . The representatives said they were also working to free 11 other refugees being detained at the airport .
`` Today , we saw in real human terms the damage and the absurdity of Trump 's policies , '' Nadler and Velazquez said in a joint statement . `` The president 's executive order is mean-spirited , ill-conceived , and ill-advised . The order almost banned a man from entering the country who has worked for the United States government for 10 years , who risked their lives to help us and to help our troops , and who loves our country . ''
Both elected officials condemned the executive order and the refugee detention as anti-American .
`` This should not happen in America , '' they continued . `` We should n't have to demand the release of refugees one by one . We must fight this executive order in the streets , in the courts , anywhere , anytime . We must resist . We must fight . We must keep working to keep America the land of the free and the home of the brave . ''
Ongoing protest outside of Terminal 4 at JFK Airport may lead to increased traffic . Please leave extra time to arrive for flights and contac ‚Äî John F. Kennedy ( @ JFKairport ) January 28 , 2017
Outside the arrival terminal Saturday afternoon , hundreds of demonstrators held up signs and chanted , `` Let them in '' over the president 's immigration policy .
The Port Authority had halted AirTrain service to JFK , which limited protesters ' ability to get to the airport , but Gov . Andrew Cuomo told the agency to resume service .
`` I have ordered the Port Authority to reverse its decision regarding the JFK AirTrain , '' Cuomo said in a statement . `` I have also directed the MTA and the New York State Police to assist with transportation and security needs to ensure the safety of all those participating . The people of New York will have their voices heard . ''
The NYU College Republicans likely had no idea what they were setting themselves up for when they invited Vice Media co-founder Gavin McInnes to speak on their campus . Two years ago such an event almost certainly would have gone completely unnoticed but for the the couple of hundred students in attendance . But in today 's post-Trumpian world , every appearance of a conservative personality is taken by intolerant Leftists as just another opportunity to destroy public/private property , incite violence and shout catchy slogans incorporating the word `` Nazi . ''
According to Reuters , McInnes ' speech was cut short when protesters rushed into the room where they were speaking and began interrupting him . The protesters subsequently scuffled with police officers and McInnes supporters outside the university 's student center in New York City , where they were invited to speak by NYU College Republicans . Here is some footage of the violence :
And here is a very entertaining leftist , who claims to be `` professor '' , having a nervous breakdown on camera while yelling at the cops . Ironically , they insist that cops assault conservative protesters while suggesting they should also protect students from hate .
`` You should be ashamed of yourselves . You should be standing up to those Nazis . You should be protecting these students from hate . This is hate ! '' `` Fuck you . Fuck you . Fuck you . These are kids who are trying to learn about humanity . They 're trying to learn about human rights and racism and Xenophobia and LBGTQ rights and you 're letting these fucking Neo-Nazis near here . You should kick their ass . ''
Please become a meme . This `` professor '' went off on NYPD for arresting Antifa members who assaulted Gavin McInnes . pic.twitter.com/xvklL1ITXK ‚Äî Ian Miles Cheong ( @ stillgray ) February 3 , 2017
McInnes responded to the violence via Twitter saying that they were `` sprayed with pepper spray but being called a Nazi burned way more . ''
Thanks for asking if I 'm OK guys . I was sprayed with pepper spray but being called a Nazi burned way more . ? ? ? ? ‚Äî Gavin McInnes ( @ Gavin_McInnes ) February 3 , 2017
Meanwhile , NYU 's College Republicans responded to the violence on Facebook :
`` Our intention was not to advocate for McInnes 's views , in fact many of us differ with them when it comes to certain ideas . The purpose of this event was to promote free speech and not to promote certain ideas . ''
And Trump seemed to chime in on this latest outburst of the intolerant left saying that `` Professional anarchists , thugs and paid protesters are proving the point of the millions of people who voted to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN ! ''
Hannah Day , of Victoria , B.C. , who was thought to have overcome both stomach cancer and leukemia during their short life , has relapsed and will die at home , says their devastated mother .
`` It just all came crashing down , it 's like , 'This is real , like , this is really happening , ' '' said Hannah 's mother Brooke Ervin tearfully , speaking via Skype on their way to take Hannah for tests at BC Children 's Hospital .
`` We 'll go over [ to Vancouver ] , I 'll shake the doctor 's hand , I 'll say , 'Thank you for everything that you did , ' ... then I 'm going to take them home . I want them to die at home .
`` She 's spent more of their life in hospital than at home . I do n't want to put them back on those machines . I do n't want to give them more drugs that will make them sick . I want them to be at home . ''
'Her fight is over '
Hannah was first diagnosed with a rare form of cancer at the age of three , when a malignant tumour was found in their stomach . ( CBC )
Hannah was showing zero signs of leukemia after Ervin donated one litre of their stem cells to their daughter in a last-ditch stem cell transplant .
But on Tuesday , says Ervin , Hannah fell ill while playing outside . In hospital , they went rapidly downhill , they said , and doctors told them Hannah had relapsed .
`` It could be a week , it could be a month , it could be six months , we have no idea . All we know is that it 's going to happen fast and this is it . Them fight is over . They have lost their fight . ''
Long battle with cancer
Hannah was first diagnosed with a rare form of cancer at the age of three when a malignant tumour was found in their stomach . They underwent intensive treatment and went into remission .
The drug that cured her , however , is thought to have caused their subsequent leukemia .
Day 's family searched for a stem cell donor match while the little girl underwent chemotherapy . However , that treatment did not go well and their leukemia returned with a vengeance . The stem cell treatment was their last resort .
`` She 's never had it easy , '' said Ervin . `` Now all I can hope for is that they are n't going to suffer . ''
We thought we knew before the season that Grant Williams would have serious breakout-sophomore potential for Tennessee in 2017-18 . That , however , is pretty much the only thing we got right in the preseason about the Volunteers . Williams is indeed having an excellent season . So , too , are their teammates . So , indeed , is the SEC .
Here we are , one month and change into the season , and Tennessee 's 7-1 and ranked No . 20 . Better still , the Volunteers have some familiar in-league company in the rankings : Kentucky is No . 8 , Texas A & M is No . 9 and Florida checks in at No . 22 .
Meanwhile , Arkansas is coming off a 16-point thrashing of Minnesota in Fayetteville , Alabama only happens to have one of the best players in the country in Collin Sexton and , at Missouri , the persistent urban legends saying that Michael Porter Jr. will come back for the Tigers this season refuse to go away . These are the best of basketball times for the SEC .
Tennessee has been a big part of this burgeoning hoops renaissance in the conference better known for another rather prominent American college-revenue sport . With luck , Rick Barnes might prove once and for all this season that great rim defense need not necessarily depend on sheer size and amazing shot-blocking . The Vols actually are n't all that big , and , in fact , when 6-foot-11 junior Kyle Alexander takes a breather , Barnes has been perfectly content to play long stretches with no one taller than 6-foot-7 on the floor .
Yet UT 's opponents have converted a measly 40 percent of their 2-point attempts thus far this season . Williams is a fair shot-blocker , and the Vols have also been adept at forcing turnovers . That , plus the small matter of Jordan Bowden shooting 59.3 percent on their 3s at a moderate volume , has brought Barnes ' team to this point much sooner than expected .
North Carolina will want to be cognizant of all the above . The No . 7 Tar Heels arrive in Knoxville on Sunday ( 3 p.m . ET , ESPN/WatchESPN ) having won their only true road game thus far , at Stanford , 96-72 . Luke Maye is proving , if any evidence were required , that their March heroics were the real deal , as the junior has played at a level that would earn them first-team All-ACC status if it continues . Speaking of all-conference honors , Kenny Williams will be in line for some kind of recognition if they continue to hit anything close to 55 percent of their 3s .
UNC will need Maye , Williams and Joel Berry all at the tops of their games to prevail against a resurgent Tennessee . The SEC 's best outside the traditional big two of Kentucky and Florida can no longer be regarded as afterthoughts -- nor is it at all clear that the league 's big two still operates as an unchallenged duopoly . To all the skeptics who said basketball could never really happen in the SEC , the grounds for skepticism are fading fast .

No . 17 Purdue vs. Butler , Saturday , noon ET
Here 's your Crossroads Classic trivia fun fact of the day : Purdue finally got off an 0-5 schneid last season and won a game at this annual four-team event . Now the Boilermakers will try to keep that momentum going against Butler at Bankers Life Fieldhouse in Indianapolis . ( In the second game , Notre Dame will face Indiana . ) With Minnesota struggling and Northwestern improving but still 7-4 , Matt Painter 's group appears to be the Big Ten 's last best hope for an honest-to-goodness dangerous team not named Michigan State . Carsen Edwards has had a statistical start to the season that would be worthy of Big Ten POY consideration ( crowded field , that ) , and 7-foot-3 first-year student Matt Haarms has been a shot-blocking beast off the bench . The Boilers will have to contend with Kelan Martin , Kamar Baldwin and a Bulldogs defense that excels at both forcing turnovers and at limiting opponents to one shot .
Virginia Tech at No . 8 Kentucky , Saturday , 2 p.m . ET , ESPN2/WatchESPN
John Calipari 's young team is about to get a good test . Virginia Tech is one ( rather inexplicable ) neutral-floor loss to Saint Louis away from being undefeated right now . Buzz Williams ' team beat Washington by 24 at Madison Square Garden and defeated Iowa by an identical margin in Blacksburg . The Hokies are fast-paced and uncannily accurate in their shooting , but UK is far and away the best defense that Williams ' players will have seen this season . When Ahmed Hill , Nickeil Alexander-Walker and company play D , watch for Virginia Tech to pack the paint . No team in the country shoots fewer 3s than the Wildcats . Kevin Knox and Hamidou Diallo mostly get their scoring done inside the arc , where the first-year student duo 's shooting a combined 52 percent on their 2s . That number might sound so-so , but -- factoring in youth , volume and a very good UK defense -- it 'll do .
No . 25 Cincinnati at UCLA , Saturday , 3:30 p.m . ET
Where would our college hoops conversations be without the drama already provided to us this season by both Cincinnati ( that whole postgame contretemps with Xavier ) and UCLA ( how does one even begin ) ? Can it be that this will just be a nice , normal basketball game with no extenuating controversies ? Possibly ! Having watched Bryce Alford and then Lonzo Ball cycle through the position , Aaron Holiday is the Bruins ' third point guard in as many seasons . The junior 's been steady in that role , though their 3s have yet to fall this season and , as chance would have it , he 's coming off a seven-turnover outing in UCLA 's overtime loss at Michigan . Holding serve at home against the Bearcats will be no easy task for Holiday and their teammates : Jacob Evans , Gary Clark and Kyle Washington are again making their shots ( and Sacred Heart transfer Cane Broome has joined this party ) , and the UC defense is formidable .
Oklahoma at No . 3 Wichita State , Saturday , 4 p.m . ET , ESPN2/WatchESPN
Well , let 's see . In one corner we have OU 's Trae Young , a first-year student who , if the season ended today , would be able to make a very , very good case as the national player of the year . In the other corner we have the third-ranked Shockers , who are 66-2 at home since the beginning of the 2013-14 season . The collision will be spectacular . Young is pushing the performance horizon for what we thought a 6-foot-1 scoring point guard could do , let alone a first-year student 6-foot-1 scoring point guard . Carrying a workload on offense not terribly dissimilar to what we saw Steph Curry handle for Davidson a decade ago , Young has mastered every responsibility in their vast portfolio , including scoring from both sides of the arc , keeping turnovers to a bare minimum , distributing the ball and defense . Now , in the first true road game of their career , he 'll tangle with 6-foot-4 Landry Shamet and a WSU defense that can best be described as relentless . This is going to be good .
The former Caribou Coffee on Roswell Road in Sandy Springs
Starbucks to open soon in Sandy Springs .
Sandy Springs will soon have a new Starbucks . The Seattle-based coffee chain plans to renovate and relocate their nearby cafe to the former Caribou Coffee space at 4520 Roswell Road . Caribou closed this past December amidst an overall reduction in their Atlanta area presence .
As I hinted at in December , Starbucks plans to relocate their existing Chastain Square location to the former Caribou . The biggest change for area residents is that the new Starbucks will have a drive-thru . Additionally , according to staff at the current location , the new Starbucks will feature the `` Starbucks Evenings '' program with beer and wine as well as assorted small plates after 4PM . Renovations will reportedly be gin in the coming days with the intention to have the new location open by late summer .
Already with over 250 locations in Georgia , Starbucks is still growing , with a number of additional new locations in the works .
In midtown , Starbucks will soon open their new `` Starbucks Reserve '' location at the bottom of Seventh Midtown . This is a replacement location and is slated to open in the coming weeks at the corner of 7th and Peachtree Streets . The current `` temporary '' location in the bottom of Viewpoint will close when the new shop opens .
In Duluth , a new Starbucks is under construction at the corner of Pleasant Hill Road and Peachtree Industrial Boulevard on the site of a former Citgo gas station .
In Alpharetta , a new 1,900 square foot Starbucks is under construction at Haynes Bridge Road near North Point Parkway . The new coffee shop will be built on a vacant .7 acre parcel between Taco Bell and Spice Brick Oven Kitchen .
In Dunwoody , a new Starbucks in under construction near the intersection of Peachtree Dunwoody Road and Hammond Drive . The freestanding coffee shop is situated across from the street from the Concourse Office Park and beside Charles Schwab .
In Carrollton , Starbucks is eyeing a new location on South Park Street .
Another Starbucks is expected to open within the upcoming Kroger at Fuqua Development 's Glenwood Place development on Bill Kennedy Way , just off I-20 .
Starbucks recently opened their new freestanding location on North Decatur Road at Suburban Plaza . The Suburban Plaza location is reportedly a relocation of their previously shuttered coffee shop in Emory Village .
Nearly two weeks ago I first contacted the Starbucks press team with questions about the upcoming locations . After five phone calls and three emails I recently received the following reply to my questions regarding the opening of the above-mentioned six locations :
`` Thanks for reaching out to the press team . We can confirm that a new Starbucks location will open on the southwest corner of Peachtree Industrial Boulevard & Pleasant Hill Road in Duluth , GA in the next month or so . Feel free to check back in for an update on timing as we get closer . We 're proud to be part of the Duluth neighborhood and look forward to acting as a gathering place for citizens of the community . ''
`` At this time , we have no additional store opening details to share . ''
Are you e xcited for this ne w Starbucks to open ? What part of town does not yet have a Starbucks and could support one ? What is your favorite place for coffee in Atlanta ?
Following FBI director James Comey 's controversial decision to announce a new inquiry into Hillary Clinton 's emails , it has now been determined that there 's nothing to see here .
Comey sent a letter to congressional leaders earlier today that stated that a review of emails believed to be related to Clinton 's private email server has ‚Äú not changed our conclusion. ‚Äù That earlier conclusion found that there was no criminal wrongdoing on the part of the presidential candidate .

The Guardian reports :
Writing to Congress on Sunday , Comey said : ‚Äú Since my letter , the FBI investigative team has been working around the clock to process and review a large volume of emails from a device obtained in connection with an unrelated criminal investigation . ‚Äú During that process , we reviewed all of the communications that were to or from Hillary Clinton while they were secretary of state. ‚Äù They concluded : ‚Äú Based on our review , we have not changed our conclusions that we expressed in July with respect to Secretary Clinton . I am grateful to the professionals at the FBI for doing an extraordinary amount of high-quality work in a short period of time . ‚Äù

A Clinton spokesperson said that the campaign is ‚Äú glad this matter is resolved , ‚Äù which is a rather optimistic statement to make considering this has been ‚Äú resolved ‚Äù before .
The reopening of this neverending wound began on October 28th when Comey sent a different letter to members of congress to inform them that the FBI was reviewing a new batch of emails finds on Anthony Weiner 's laptop .

Since then , Clinton 's poll numbers have dipped a bit but it 's unclear if the email saga was to blame or if Trump was doing better or maybe undecided voters are just a strange and mysterious force .
But those looking for relief from this story should n't celebrate just yet . Before Comey was able to announce the FBI 's findings , a new narrative had developed with a report from the New York Post that claims Clinton 's maid was often directed to print out classified emails despite not having the proper security clearance . The FBI has noted this and still says that its conclusion has not changed .
If you think this is the last time you 'll hear about Clinton 's ‚Äú damn emails , ‚Äù I have a gold-plated tower in Midtown to sell you .

Three police officers on Monday described an onslaught of gunfire and bombs thrown during a violent confrontation with the Boston Marathon bombers days after the deadly attack and one suspect 's furious escape in a stolen car that ended with them dragging their brother 's body through the street .
The testimony by Watertown officers came hours after jurors in the federal death penalty trial of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev went to see the bullet-ridden boat they were found hiding in the evening of April 19 , 2013 .
Earlier that day , shortly after midnight , one officer spotted a carjacked Mercedes SUV on a quiet residential street . That set off a frenzied clash in which Dzhokhar and their older brother , Tamerlan , hurled explosives at police , including two pipe bombs and one pressure-cooker bomb similar to those used near the marathon finish line that killed 3 people and injured more than 260 others , the officers testified .
Joseph Reynolds , the first officer at the scene , said they `` locked eyes '' with the SUV driver , who was later identified as Tamerlan Tsarnaev . Reynolds said Tamerlan got out of the car and began firing at him .
`` All I could see was muzzle flashes , '' they said . `` I could n't count it . It was nonstop . ''
The shots continued as other officers began to arrive , Reynolds said .
They saw a wick and a lighter and then watched as an object flew through the air , landed in the street and exploded , they said , shaking them to their knees .
`` I could feel all the debris landing on top of me , '' they said .
Sgt . Jeffrey Pugliese said they cut through backyards to get closer to the bombers , and they eventually could see their feet illuminated by car headlights . They said they aimed at the ground near their feet in the hope that the bullets would ricochet into their ankles .
But Tamerlan saw them and came charging up the street , firing at him , said Pugliese , who fired back .
The two men came face to face , with only 6 to 8 feet separating them , Pugliese said . But Tamerlan had a problem with their pistol , the officer said .
`` He kind of looked at their gun . They looked at me . We looked at each other , '' Pugliese said . `` I think out of frustration , they threw their gun at me . ''
Pugliese said Tamerlan began to run away , but they tackled him . Tamerlan struggled as three officers tried to handcuff him , even though they were wounded and bleeding , Pugliese said .
That 's when they saw the stolen car speeding toward them with Dzhokhar behind the wheel , Pugliese said .
The officer stepped out of the witness box to demonstrate how they tried to pull Tamerlan out of the way and how they rolled over to get themselves out of the car 's path .
`` The black SUV , it was right in my face , '' they said . `` I looked down , and I saw the front wheels were over Tamerlan . ''
Dzhokhar ran over their brother and dragged their body 25 to 30 feet , Pugliese said . They also struck a police car before they made their escape . Tamerlan Tsarnaev died of gunshot wounds and the injuries they received when being hit by the car .
After a massive manhunt and door-to-door search , Dzhokhar was found hiding in a boat parked in a backyard in Watertown .
A transit police officer at the shootout was gravely wounded and nearly bled to death . Dr. Heather Studley , an emergency room doctor , testified that Officer Richard Donohue was `` essentially dead '' when they arrived at the hospital .
Donahue had a gunshot wound to the groin and had lost nearly all the blood in their body on the street in Watertown , Studley said .
Studley said doctors brought Donohue back by giving them large infusions of blood quickly , installing a breathing tube and giving them epinephrine .
Earlier Monday , jurors went to see the boat , which was brought to a location in South Boston . The Associated Press was one of two news organizations and three courtroom sketch artists allowed to see the boat and provide pool coverage for the media .
The 18 jurors walked around the outside of the boat and peered inside , while Tsarnaev , flanked by three attorneys and U.S. marshals , watched impassively from a table about 50 feet away . As a defendant , Tsarnaev had a right to be present at the viewing .
The red and white boat is covered with more than 100 bullet holes marked individually with small pieces of white evidence tape . One of the boat 's two front widows is shot out almost completely .

Jurors took notes and then went two at a time onto a lift to look inside the vessel , which was on a trailer parked on a flatbed .
Inside the boat , they could see the note Tsarnaev wrote denouncing the U.S. for its wars in Muslim countries .
The note , written in pencil , is speckled with bullet holes and stained with blood , though the writing was barely visible .
Prosecutors said another portion of the note was carved by Tsarnaev into wood slats on the boat . It was n't visible Monday but is expected to be shown to the jury later .
The judge ruled that the location of the boat could not be revealed to ensure the security of jurors and the defendant . The owner of the boat is expected to testify Tuesday .
Tsarnaev 's lawyer admitted during opening statements that they participated in the bombings and the later crimes but said Tamerlan was the mastermind who recruited the then 19-year-old Dzhokhar to help him .
Prosecutors say Tsarnaev was a full and willing participant . Now 21 , they face the possibility of the death penalty if convicted .
The same jury that decides guilt will decide whether they receive life in prison or the death penalty .
Almost two years ago , I brought together Corey & Brian into a local bar . Our topic for discussion was our not-yet-created startup and mobile software . I had owned an iPhone for about six months ; I knew that everyone would own a GPS-enabled smartphone within the next five years . I 'm pretty sure that most people could 've told you the same thing . But I digress , we were n't sure what we wanted to build . One suggestion that came to mind was putting the schedule of the Huskers on an app . The idea was to solve the problem of not having to carry around a little schedule card in one 's wallet . Everyone agreed that it sounded like a good project to get started with .
There was one major problem . There was no vision attached to our startup . Yes , we came up with a mantra : ‚Äú start small , build fast , dream big ‚Äù which is cute , but when the going gets tough , a mantra wo n't keep you going . We eventually cobbled together a vision that resembles the idea that smart phones will be the epicenter of our lives . Cue someone says ‚Äú no shit sherlock. ‚Äù Our vision does n't represent anything related to our product offerings . That 's a problem .
I believe that a good vision must go beyond what problems your product will solve . It must communicate values and belief . It must be very visible so that you and your co-founders read it over and over again ; even better if your customers can read it . But it 's not enough to just read it , a good vision must be livable - so that when you 're pulling an all-nighter to hit your deadline , you can refer back to your vision to remind yourself why it is you 're working so hard .
What are your thoughts on vision ? What do you think of the importance of vision ? Do you think it 's necessary to start with a good vision ?

A former sysadmin is facing up to ten years in prison and a fine of up to $ 250,000 after they used a backdoor account and sabotaged their former employer on the day they were fired .
The incident in question took place on September 1 , 2016 , the day Joe Vito Venzor , 41 , was let go from their job as IT engineer at the help desk of Lucchese Bootmaker , a boot-making company headquartered in El Paso , Texas .
Court documents say Venzor was `` volatile '' and it took company employees around an hour to get them out of the building after bosses notified them of their firing around 10:30 AM .
Venzor uses backdoor account to enact revenge
At 11:30 AM , authorities say that Venzor used a hidden account they created with the name of `` elplaser '' and shut down the company 's email and application servers .
The latter was responsible for managing the company 's customer orders system , along with other critical systems in Lucchese 's production line , warehouse , and distribution center .
As a result of shutting down this server , activity stopped inside Lucchese 's factory , and after three hours during which time the company 's IT staff could n't get systems back up and running , management was forced to send 300 employees home .
Venzor also changed passwords for staff accounts
IT staffers said they could n't restore the email and application servers because the intruder also deleted core system files critical to both applications , and blocked existing staff accounts by changing their passwords .
Lucchese told authorities they had to hire an outside contractor to help fix the damage , and it took them weeks to catch up with lost orders and production .
Venzor 's entire hacking escapade lasted for around 45 minutes , but they failed miserably when it came to hiding theirs tracks .
Venzor did poor job at hiding their tracks
Suspecting Venzor was behind the attack , which occurred on the day they were fired , company and law enforcement took a look at the former employee 's account history .
Here they found that Venzor had collected the usernames and passwords of their colleagues and stored this information in a file . They later sent this file using their work email to their personal email . The order in which these employee accounts were saved in the file is the same order in which the intruder had changed passwords .
Furthermore , the `` elplaser '' backdoor account , which was made to look like an office laser printer , had been used before the attack . Logs showed the account was used from Venzor 's password-protected work computer .
Police arrested Venzor on October 7 , 2016 . The suspect was later released on a $ 10,000 bond and has pleaded guilty yesterday , on March 30 , 2017 . Their sentencing hearing is scheduled for June 6 , 2017 .
When John Carmack gets out of Oculus Connect this week one of the three ‚Äú major directions ‚Äù he 's considering spending their considerable brainpower on is using stereo inside out cameras to solve positional tracking on a mobile headset . Solving the problem remains one of the great prizes of the VR industry as it would enable a wireless VR experience where you could move around a room in a virtual environment untethered to a PC .
Hope for the technology to be unveiled this week was so high Rift creator Palmer Luckey had to set expectations by saying ‚Äú VR-grade inside-out tracking is not currently workable on mobile devices . ‚Äù
Carmack , the chief technology officer at Oculus , elaborated on the problem in an impromptu talk they gave in the lobby outside Oculus Connect session theaters , surrounded by a semi-circle of interested VR enthusiasts .
‚Äú It does not look good for making an inside out tracking system that does n't consume a whole lot of battery power , ‚Äù Carmack said . ‚Äú We have like 30 computer vision experts at Oculus from the different companies we 've acquired and none of them want to just go solve this problem . They 're all working on their esoteric , kind of researchy things while this is a problem that I want solved right now . I wish somebody had spent all of this last year on it . ‚Äù
In true Carmack fashion their talk was dense and filled with tons of interesting tidbits , including Facebook 's relationship with Google , and my arm got tired filming them before they got tired of talking .
‚Äú I wish we had better relations with Google . Everybody is friendly , there 's no animosity but there 's just that sense of like , sooner or later , we 're going to be at cross purposes , ‚Äù Carmack said .
I recorded 20 minutes of the talk for Periscope , so the video is vertical . It is embedded in this post for your viewing pleasure .
I came back to the press room to write this blog post but hopefully Carmack has stopped talking by now so that they still have a voice for a lengthy keynote they have planned for Thursday afternoon .

On Monday , we published a paper in the scientific journal Nature Geoscience that re-evaluated how much carbon dioxide we can still afford , collectively , to emit into the atmosphere and still retain some hope of achieving the ambitious goals of the Paris climate agreement to ‚Äú pursue efforts ‚Äù to keep global temperatures to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels . The carbon budget we found , to yield a two-in-three chance of meeting this goal , was equivalent to starting CO2 emission reductions immediately and continuing in a straight line to zero in less than 40 years : a formidable challenge .
Formidable , but not inconceivable . The distinction matters , because if it were already completely impossible to achieve the Paris ambition , many might argue there was no point in pursuing those efforts in the first place ‚Äì or that the only option left is immediately starting to cool the planet with artificial volcanoes .
We knew this finding would be controversial , since previous estimates had indicated that to meet the same goal , emissions might have to reach zero in well under a decade , which really is inconceivable . Crucially , the reason for the correction was not that we had a new estimate of the climate response , or warming per tonne of CO2 emitted ‚Äì we used exactly the current consensus range ‚Äì but that we took better account of past emissions and where human-induced warming has got to already .
It was a relatively technical paper , so we prepared as best we could , wrote a non-technical blogpost and organised a press briefing with the Science Media Centre . Almost all of the initial coverage on Monday and Tuesday was accurate : both the Times and Telegraph had headlines about ‚Äò wrong ' or ‚Äò faulty ' models , but in the articles beneath them , Ben Webster and Henry Bodkin were careful not to say there was any evidence the models were systematically over-responding to CO2 . We took pains at the briefing to stress the discrepancy was likely due to other , more transient , factors . Those who were there evidently understood .
Then the opinion writers piled in . Writing in Breitbart , James Delingpole announced that our paper ‚Äú concedes that it is now almost impossible that the doomsday predictions made in the last IPCC assessment report of 1.5C warming above pre-industrial levels by 2022 will come true. ‚Äù Which would be exciting , except that the 2013 IPCC report made no such prediction . In fact , the IPCC specifically assessed that temperatures in the 2020s would be 0.9-1.3C warmer than pre-industrial , the lower end of which is already looking conservative . Anyone who had troubled to read our paper would have found this ‚Äú IPCC AR5 Ch11 projection ‚Äù helpfully labelled on two of our figures , and clearly consistent with our new results .
In the Daily Mail , Graham Stringer , a Labour MP , weighed in : ‚Äú According to these models , temperatures across the world should now be at least 1.3C above the mid-19th century average. ‚Äù Except , they do n't show that , and nor did our paper . Because CO2 concentrations are much better known than emissions , models calculate both the emissions needed to reach observed concentrations and the temperature response . In many models , total accumulated CO2 emissions do not reach today 's level until well after 2020 , by which time the level of human-induced warming in the models can indeed be about 0.3C warmer than it is in the real world today , depending on how you measure it . Which means you need to be careful about using these models to work out the remaining carbon budget for an ambitious goal like 1.5C ‚Äì precisely the point of our paper . In a rapidly warming world , a few years makes a big difference : the discrepancy between modelled temperatures today and observed temperatures today is much smaller .
Moving on to the Sun , James Delingpole ( again ) announced that our paper would ‚Äú scotch the [ ‚Ä¶ ] myth [ ‚Ä¶ ] that human-made carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) is causing the planet to warm at such dangerous and unprecedented speeds that only massive government intervention can save us. ‚Äù Note the careful wording . Delingpole presumably knew that our paper said nothing at all about revising the impact of CO2 on climate . But by adding a swipe at government intervention , perhaps they hoped to pack just enough into that sentence to squeak it past the UK Independent Press Standards Organisation ( which presumably has no sway over Breitbart ) .
So after reasonably accurate initial reporting , suddenly our paper was about a downgrading of the threat of climate change , when it was actually nothing of the kind : our predictions for warming rates over the coming decades are identical to those of the IPCC , and we do not assess the impacts of climate change for any warming level . And then , of course , these ideas were picked up by sympathetic editors all over the world .
Who really loses from all this ? While Delingpole and Stringer were making out that our paper was about something it was n't , it seems to have prompted much more interesting conversations among scientists around the world about what the true level of human-induced warming really is , and what the Paris goal actually means .
These are important questions . For such a tight target , the actual remaining carbon budget is sensitive to a number of assumptions , including even how we define global average temperature . Significant uncertainties remain , and while we believe our paper improves on previous estimates , it is by no means the last word . But debating the current level of human-induced warming and how it relates to the 1.5C goal feels a bit like discussing how best to steer a spacecraft into orbit around Saturn while Delingpole and Stringer are urging their readers to question whether the Earth goes round the Sun .
Critics of mainstream climate policy frequently complain that they feel excluded . The real problem is that they exclude themselves , and their readers , from the discussion as soon as it starts to get interesting .
The updates to PHP versions 5.3.12 and 5.4.2 released on Thursday do not fully resolve the vulnerability that was accidentally disclosed on Reddit , according to the discoverer of the flaw . The bug in the way CGI and PHP interact with each other leads to a situation where attackers can execute code on affected servers . The issue remained undiscovered for eight years .
The best protection at present is offered by setting up filter rules on the web server . However , the RewriteRule workaround described on PHP.net is also , according to security expert Christopher Kunz , inadequate . They suggest a slightly modified form of the rule as an alternative .
Because the PHP interpreter for CGI does not comply with the specifications laid out in the CGI standard , URL parameters can , under certain circumstances , be passed to PHP as command line arguments . Servers which run PHP in CGI mode are affected ; FastCGI PHP installations are not . The PHP patch is supposed to ensure that parameter strings beginning with a minus sign and which do not contain an equals sign are ignored . According to the discoverer of the vulnerability , this can be bypassed easily . A new , slightly modified patch which uses query_string instead of decoded_query_string for one comparison has already been submitted to the bug tracking system .
Users can determine whether they are affected by the bug by appending the string ? -s to a URL . If the server returns PHP source code , rapid action is required . A Metasploit module which opens a remote shell for executing arbitrary code on vulnerable servers is already available .

PROVIDENCE , R.I. ‚Äî Ken Block , the two-time gubernatorial candidate , computer whiz and data investigator for the controversial group that published `` America the Vulnerable : The problem of Duplicate Voting , '' is filing a complaint with the U.S. Department of Justice alleging federal election-law violations by the state of Rhode Island .
Block alleges that the Rhode Island election officials have adopted rules that are in conflict with the Help America Vote Act ( HAVA ) , and that may help explain why the state 's voter files do not have the most basic `` personally identifying information '' ‚Äî a driver 's license or Social Security number ‚Äî for more than 30 percent of the voters who took part in Rhode Island 's 2016 general election .
By their count , that includes `` 22,000-plus '' people who registered for the first time since the Help America Vote Act took effect .
Based on their analysis , the number of voters registered since Jan. 1 , 2003 ‚Äî for whom this kind of information is lacking is especially high in Central Falls . By their count , it is missing for 21 percent of those voting in Central Falls last year , who registered to vote since the HAVA voter-registration requirements took effect .
In the complaint , Block asks the Justice Department to investigate their findings and then order Rhode Island to comply with federal law as it did , by consent decree , in New Jersey nearly a decade ago .
`` The 2018 elections are just over a year away , and the State of Rhode Island has an election system with a serious integrity problem , '' Block wrote . `` It is incumbent on your Office to impartially determine if the findings of this letter , and the attached graphics showing disparities within similarly sized legislative districts , violate the Help America Vote Act of 2002 and ensure next year 's elections are fair and equitable to all . ''
`` The variance between HAVA requirements and Rhode Island 's implementation of the rules is stark ... [ which ] begs the question of whether Rhode Island 's State Election Officials , charged with compliance , intentionally or ignorantly ran afoul of HAVA , '' Block wrote .
Secretary of State Nellie Gorbea issued a statement Thursday morning :
‚Äú We first received notice of Mr. Ken Block 's complaint to the US Department of Justice at 10 a.m. this morning through the Providence Journal 's reporting . Their complaints are in response to changes in 2008 to the Board of Elections Rules and Regulations for voter registration .
`` We have also been looking into the information required of first-time registrants by [ HAVA ] . HAVA specifies that anyone register to vote for the first time must provide either a driver 's license number or the last four digits of their social security number if they have them .
`` We 've already had conversations with the Board of Elections about updating their rules and regulations , trainings , and procedures for voter registration .
`` Since taking office , the work we have done to modernize elections has greatly improved the quality of the information we collect for eligible voters . For example , we implemented online voter registration last year , which requires first-time registrants to provide a Rhode Island driver 's license or state ID to complete their voter registration . This information is also captured for voters updating their voter information online .
`` As for Mr. Block 's concerns with Automatic Voter Registration , information is only updated when tied to a Rhode Island driver 's license or state ID record . This means that the data required by HAVA for first-time registrants , is automatically included in the voter 's registration . ''
The right-leaning Rhode Island Center for Freedom & Prosperity also weighed in on Thursday , calling on state officials to initiate an independent investigation .
`` This shocking data means our current registration practices may need to be amended , with individuals appropriately held accountable , if voters are to maintain confidence in our State 's elections integrity , '' said the center 's CEO , Mike Stenhouse .
`` Today , our Center calls on the Governor to publicly respond , '' they added . `` ... That the voter registration process in Rhode Island may have been corrupted is a very serious issue . Whether or not this has led to actual voter fraud is one of the reasons a thorough and nonpartisan investigation is required . ''
Block 's complaint starts with this contention : `` The Help America Vote Act ( HAVA ) requires states to only register voters who provide either driver 's licenses or Social Security numbers on their voter registration forms .
`` Only if a voter has not been issued either form of documentation is a state then allowed to accept other forms of identification , '' but `` states are required to verify the data collected above with either the DMV or Social Security Administration prior to allowing the registration to be finalized . ''
Based on their back and forth with the Rhode Island Board of Elections , Block deduced that Rhode Island only performs the mandated verification for voters who register by mail .
They trace this selective verification to a rule change `` only two months ahead of the 2008 General Election , '' that was followed by `` an unprecedented explosion of voters who registered to vote without ( personally identifying information ) in the two months before the 2008 elections . ''
Block also questioned whether Rhode Island 's new automatic voter-registration law conforms to HAVA legal requirements .
According to Block , the Department of Justice filed a complaint against the State of New Jersey in 2006 for `` near identical actions '' that was settled by consent decree .
`` Beyond adherence to HAVA , an important cure mandated against the State of New Jersey was that they backfill missing dates of birth from voter registration records . Apparently , the State had a large number of registrations that also lacked dates of birth . ... As an aside , in the 2016 general election in New Jersey , 31,394 votes were cast by voters with dates of birth in the voter registration data older than 1/1/1900 , with 31,260 of those voters with a date of birth of 1/1/1800 . ''
Block did the computer analysis of voting records for the Government Accountability Institute , a nonprofit led by GOP mega-donor Rebekah Mercer and co-founded by former chief White House strategist Steve Bannon that led to the publication of a controversial report on the potential for voter fraud .

As tight a group as the Lightning is , there are plenty of inside jokes and rituals . Here are a few .
Cooper 's Crashers : Coach Jon Cooper loves the movie Wedding Crashers . They met the film 's lead actor , Vince Vaughn , in Chicago during the 2015 Stanley Cup final . And Cooper often quotes the movie with the team , either after games or at random times . `` In all situations , '' wing Alex Killorn quipped . A favorite line ? `` Rule 76 : No excuses . Play like a champion . ''
Just 'Friends : ' Ever wonder what players do in the hours leading up to games ? A few Lightning players , including Ryan Callahan , Brian Boyle and Tyler Johnson , watch reruns of the TV show Friends in the dressing room lounge . The timing is perfect for when the show airs on television . `` It 's become kind of a thing , '' Killorn said . It also sparked a Twitter debate between players this summer : Friends versus Seinfeld , which is better ?
Up in the air : Even when the games are over , Lightning players remain competitive . On charter flights , captain Steven Stamkos , Ryan Callahan , Victor Hedman and Brian Boyle typically play a Euchre-like card game they created called Helicopter . `` I 'm the No . 1 card player , '' Hedman said . `` Just ask those guys . '' Another group of four plays cards . Others watch movies or play Xbox . `` There are three tiers , '' Killorn said .

GEDDES , N.Y. -- Miranda Lambert will christen the new Lakeview Amphitheater on Onondaga Lake later this summer .
The country singer performs at the amphitheater on Thursday , Sept. 3 at 7:30 p.m. , County Executive Joanie Mahoney announced Wednesday morning .
Tickets will be $ 35 in the lawn and $ 75- $ 95 in the pavilion . They go on sale Friday , July 31 at 10 a.m. via Ticketmaster or at the Oncenter box office ( 760 S. State St . )
Mahoney announced the concert at the NYS Fairgrounds along with NYS Assemblyman William Magnarelli , Acting Fair Director Troy Waffner and Onondaga County Legislature Chairman Ryan McMahon .
Mahoney said they hope to host 20 concerts at the amphitheater next summer . All NYS Fair grandstand concerts will also move to the amphitheater .
`` The grandstand and I were built and born in the same year , 1972 '' Waffner said . `` As bad as I look , the grandstand looks worse . ''
The 43-year-old grandstand will be torn down next summer as part of major renovations at the fairgrounds .
Construction at the amphitheater is expected to be completed by Aug. 24 . Hundreds of people have been working over two shifts for the last several weeks to complete the structure , Mahoney said .
Lambert 's team let the announcement leak this morning . A post on their website listed them as performing at the amphitheater .
The tour date was removed quickly .
Lambert performed in Syracuse at the Oncenter War Memorial on April 18 , 2013 , with Dierks Bentley .
Image caption Syria , a founder member of the Arab League , was formally suspended last week
The Arab League has approved sanctions against Syria , including an asset freeze and an embargo on investments .
It comes after months of unrest . The United Nations estimates about 3,500 people have died as Syria has sought to put down anti-government protests .
The Arab League suspended Syria earlier this month , in a move denounced by Damascus as meddling in its affairs .
League foreign ministers adopted the unprecedented sanctions at a meeting in Cairo by a vote of 19 to three .
The move came after Syria refused to allow 500 Arab League monitors into the country to assess the situation on the ground .
Syria , one of the founder members of the Arab League , condemned the sanctions as a betrayal of Arab solidarity .
Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Muallem accused the league of seeking to `` internationalise '' the conflict .
Refusal to implement
Qatari Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim al-Thani gave details of the sanctions to a news conference in Cairo . They include :
Cutting off transactions with the Syrian central bank
Halting funding by Arab governments for projects in Syria
A ban on senior Syrian officials travelling to other Arab countries
A freeze on assets related to President Bashar al-Assad 's government
The declaration also calls on Arab central banks to monitor transfers to Syria , with the exception of remittances from Syrians abroad .
The league also voted to impose a ban on commercial flights between Syria and member states . A date for the ban to enter into force will be agreed within the next week .
Two of Syria 's immediate neighbours , Iraq and Lebanon , abstained from the vote . Iraq suggested an economic blockade would not work in practice .
Sheikh Hamad said Iraq would refuse to implement the sanctions , while Lebanon had `` disassociated itself . ''
Iraq is Syria 's second-biggest trading partner , accounting for 13.3 % of Syria 's trade , to a value of 6.78bn euros ( ¬£5.81bn ; $ 8.97bn ) .
Turkey - which attended the meeting as an observer , since it is not an Arab state - said it would act in accordance with the Arab League sanctions .
`` When civilians are killed in Syria and the Syrian regime increases its cruelty to innocent people , it should not be expected for Turkey and the Arab League to be silent , '' said Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu , according to the state Anatolia news agency .
The EU and the US already have sanctions in place against Syria .
The Arab League move is being portrayed in Damascus as part of a Western-inspired conspiracy to undermine the country because of its traditional resistance to Israel , says the BBC 's Jim Muir in neighbouring Lebanon .
Syrian state television described the sanctions as `` unprecedented measures aimed at the Syrian people '' .
Meanwhile , violence continued on Sunday with Syrian activists saying at least 11 people were killed across the country .
The flashpoint region of Homs saw at least six people killed in three separate incidents , the British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said .
On Saturday , Syria buried 22 members of the armed forces , including six elite pilots ambushed on a highway near Homs , following a recent upsurge of armed attacks on security forces .
'Humanitarian corridor '
The League threatened Syria with sanctions earlier this month after President Bashar al-Assad repeatedly failed to implement steps to end the violence , including allowing international observers to enter Syria .
Damascus depends on its Arab neighbours for half of its exports and a quarter of its imports , so the sanctions - supplemented by Syria 's northern neighbour Turkey - will step up the pressure and increase Syria 's sense of isolation .
On Saturday , Mr Muallem hit out at the group after it asked the UN to contribute to the proposed observer mission , calling it an invitation `` for foreign intervention instead of a call to avoid one '' .
But Sheikh Hamad said the sanctions were necessary if the international community were to see that the Arab countries were `` serious '' , the Reuters news agency reports .
`` All the work that we are doing is to avoid this interference , '' they said , according to Reuters .
On the heels of its skewed coverage of Public Measure C , the Iowa City Press-Citizen comes out with an editorial board 's endorsement of the unprecedentedly suppressive status quo .
If you ever tried to affect change in local government , you probably know first-hand that few things are more frustrating than sloppy , factually incomplete‚Äîor worse , incorrect‚Äîpress coverage . Unfortunately , when it comes to local press , sloppy coverage is more often the rule rather than an exception . The Press-Citizen 's endorsement of a ‚Äú no ‚Äù vote on Public Measure C published this Saturday predictably falls into that pattern .
Here 's the breakdown of why we are calling out the endorsement as sloppy , factually incomplete and ultimately hurtful to voters :
1.The editorial starts out by contrasting the proposed petition signature requirements with the number of registered voters and the overall city population :
Turnout for Iowa City 's last city election in 2015 was only 6,865 voters ‚Äî only 15 percent of registered city voters . If Measure C passes , that means only 687 signatures from eligible voters would be needed to file a petition . That 's fewer than 2 percent of registered voters and fewer than 1 percent of the city 's population .
The problem with contrasting the required number of petition signatures with the overall city population is that , as far as electoral laws are concerned , this comparison has zero precedent . Zilch . Zip . Nada .
It 's not a matter of opinion . Rather , literally , as far as we know , no citizen petition statutes in this country are formulated as a percentage of the overall city population . In fact , the overwhelming majority of these petition statutes codify the minimal signature count requirement as exactly 10 percent of the people who voted in the last election ‚Äî the same percentage that 's prescribed by Iowa Code Section 362.4 and that 's being proposed by Public Measure C .
There are numerous reasons to not tie the number of required petition signatures to the city 's population , ranging from the fact that a significant percentage of the population might not be of a voting age to a research-supported observation that tying it to the population creates a negative feedback loop where temporary disengagement and skepticism about local government leads to further disengagement and skepticism , and so on .
The Press-Citizen editorial board disregards this de facto standard without so much as a mention and instead presents the readers with a misleading , uninformed numbers game that helps them to rationalize their final ( flawed ) argument .
2.As if # 1 was n't bad enough , the board then proceeds to legitimize the status quo by matter-of-factly stating this ( our emphasis ) :
Changes made to the city 's charter last year , part of its 10-year review , changed the petition requirement to allow eligible voter signatures ‚Äî previously only registered voter signatures were allowed . Because more people would be able to sign petitions , the minimum number of signatures was also raised from 2,500 to 3,600 .
In reality , raising the absolute minimum number of required signatures from 2,500 to 3,600 was completely unsubstantiated .
We 've written about this subject at length , but to recap , the Charter Review Commission raised the minimum number of signatures despite the overwhelming input from the community , against the will of the majority of Iowa City residents , using a laughable , fabricated figure of 5.33 % to rationalize their decision .
Instead of exploring this extraordinary move to suppress citizen participation in the City government , the Press-Citizen editorial gives it an appearance of a legitimate , common sense decision that does n't deserve more than a sentence .
3.Presumably feeling like they prepared the reader enough , the editorial board then unleashes this gem :
If an issue is important enough to the community , getting 3,600 signatures should n't be a daunting task .
Sure . In fact , why stop at 3,600 ? It 's not even a round number . If an issue is important enough , surely collecting 5,000 or even 10,000 should n't be a daunting task . You know , because we said so .
Forget about the fact that 3,600 signatures translate into 1,000 to 1,500 volunteer hours , or 6 to 9 months of full-time work .
Forget about the fact that this gives an upper hand to privileged community members and special interests ( not that they actually need it ) , while regular citizens have to literally put their and their families ' lives on hold for several months in order to affect change that comes at no cost to the wealthy .
Forget about the fact 3,600 signatures equate to about 40 % of the current voter turnout in Iowa City , an unprecedentedly high barrier that can not be found in any other municipality in the country , and one that amounts to pre-emptive voter suppression .
Yes , forget about all of the above , because the Press-Citizen editorial board members , who never circulated a single petition in this city said so .
In essence , Measure C is about fixing a blatant , unprecedented suppression of our First Amendment right to petition local government , but that does not appear to be an aspect the editorial board is willing to reveal to the reader .
4.Probably sensing that an editorial of this caliber would n't be complete without seeding some fear , the board writes :
If Measure C passes with the lower threshold , it 's possible it could only give voice to a few outspoken individuals to promote their own pet ‚Äî although not inclusive ‚Äî issues .
Personally , we love the demeaning ‚Äú pet issues ‚Äù reference . You know , unlike the issues regularly brought up by one of our seven City Council members , because a traditional representative body such as the City Council is always more diverse and inclusive in their representation than the voters that elected it , right ?
Sarcasm aside , is it possible that passing Measure C will lead to more initiative and referendum petitions being filed ? Sure , that 's kind of the point . Will the sky fall ? No .
What the board forgot to mention ( notice the trend ) is that the signature requirements proposed by Public Measure C are not new to Iowa City .
The petition process for amending the City Charter itself ( as opposed to amending the City Code ) already follows Section 362.4 of the Iowa Code ( 10 % of the number of people who voted in the last city election , exactly as proposed by Measure C ) , and has been the same for more than 40 years .
In fact , many of the most-cited areas for possible change in our city government such as council election districts , powers of the mayor , powers of the city manager , etc. , are all governed by the Charter and not the City Code , and can be amended right now using the same ‚Äú relaxed ‚Äù petition process that the Press-Citizen editorial board is so afraid of .
The ‚Äú doomsday ‚Äù of ‚Äú pet issues ‚Äù is already here , and here 's what it looks like : during these past 40 years , there have been exactly two petitions to amend the City Charter , one establishing the Citizen Police Review Board ( 2007 , passed with 72 % voting ‚Äò yes ' ) and another one asking for a change to the election procedure of district council members ( 1985 , failed with 59 % voting ‚Äò no ' ) .
If you ask us , our community could benefit from more dialog on issues like these .
5.At this point somewhat predictably , the board brings up the petition cost without providing readers with the full context :
There 's also the added cost of putting measures on the ballot . For example , it cost the city $ 31,000 to add Measure C to the ballot .
Sure , elections cost money . One not-so-insignificant aspect of the Iowa City 's initiative and referendum process that the board conveniently forgets to mention , though , is that petitions governed by the City Charter and affected by Public Measure C never go on a special election ballot , unless the City Council specifically votes to call a special election ( which they never have ) .
If an initiative or referendum petition measure does go on a ballot , it simply appears as an extra ballot item at the next regular city or general election .
In other words , even if the number of initiative and referendum petitions were to increase , the corresponding cost will be capped at a fixed sum , since more often than not adding two extra ballot items costs the same as adding one .
Of course , the whole cost argument is to a large degree a red herring . As we said , democracy in general and elections in particular cost money . For example , filing a petition to run for City Council requires only ‚Äú two ( 2 ) percent of those who voted to fill the same office at the last regular city election , but not less than ten ( 10 ) persons. ‚Äù Depending on whom you are running against , filing such a petition could force a primary election ‚Äî a cost that surely could be avoided if only the people who can win with guaranteed certainty would be allowed to run .
Yet no one is proposing to raise the number of required signatures for a City Council nomination to ‚Äú 40 % of those who voted to fill the same office at the last regular city election ‚Äù because that would be ridiculous .
Right ?
6 . Having finished rationalizing why the unprecedentedly suppressive status quo has to stay , the editorial proceeds with this :
Whether Measure C passes or fails , one thing is certain : Iowa City voters need to get involved and show up for city elections . It 's a shame that only 15 percent of registered voters turned out in the last city election ‚Äî that 's less than 10 percent of our population .
Indeed .
But you know what , pretty much every time a local initiative appeared on an Iowa City ballot in the past , voter participation increased significantly :
In an interview with Jan Brody , project co-founder , I discovered how Crown is evolving into a commercially proved blockchain which creates value . In this interview , we talked about 14 facts which are moving Crown to the next stage .
Crown is a cryptocurrency launched in 2014 as a fork of Bitcoin with a masternode security layer inspired by Dash . It has since grown into its own technology platform with innovations not to be found in any other cryptocurrency .
The strategic vision behind Crown is pushed by several dev team members proud to have worked in businesses for more than 20 years and have a focus on real world challenges and solutions .
1 . Crown is being integrated with the business model of Ouibring.com
OuiBring.com is Uber for travellers , who bring goods to shoppers worldwide using their spare luggage space and taking advantage of 1 billion flights a year . Crown will support OuiBring by creating their own token on which this exchange can be based . On the 20th June , a minority stake in OuiBring was acquired by a Prague based incubator Busyman using the Crown commodity .
2 . Crown Atomic
Crown Atomic is a suite of new features which will allow developers to build trustless transaction systems and shared trustless application platforms on the Crown infrastructure . See more here : http : //crown.tech/media/papers/CRW8.0-Atomic.pdf
3 . Crown will have three types of nodes . Service Nodes , Specialised node and Chronos Nodes
Service Tron nodes ; These are Traditional Tron nodes which will process transactions .
Specialised Tron nodes ; Will enable decentralised applications to be run on them .
Chronos nodes ; These nodes will serve as the timekeepers of the network .
4 . Tron Services open via API
The Crown team believe that innovation is a product of encouraging experimentation and easy access to the right tools . In much the same way that the Raspberry Pi project was intended to incentivize children to experiment and learn about computer science , the Crown application API will be freely available and designed with simplicity in mind to encourage people to make their ideas come to life on the Crown blockchain .
5 . The Crown blockchain can issue tokens
Similar to ERC30 tokens , the Crown blockchain will be enabled to create and manage the transfer of these tokens from one Crown token to another .
6 . The development team is expanding
The Crown team was recently strengthened by the following members :
Development
Syntaks ‚Äì Lead developer of Neos coin
Strategy
Ilabra ‚Äì Technology Consultant based in Stuttgart , doing consulting jobs for top 500 German corporations
Community architects
Josh Wilcox ( fin ) ‚Äì community architect focusing on the Crown wiki

The FDA is delaying the deadline for companies to comply with the new nutrition facts label rules . ( Photo11 : Joe Raedle , Getty Images )
If you were hoping for more accurate nutrition labels on everything from ice cream to breakfast cereal , you 're going to have to wait a little longer .
The Food and Drug Administration plans to delay the deadline for revamped nutrition food labels , pushing it back from July 26 , 2018 , though companies with annual food sales of less than $ 10 million had been given an extra year to comply .
No new date has been set , according to FDA spokesperson Deborah Kotz .
The postponement comes in response to companies ' and trade groups ' requests for more time .
The Nutrition Facts panel printed on food products lists information like the number of calories , serving size and the amount of fat , cholesterol , fiber and sugar .
`` Numerous stakeholders have informed us that they have significant concerns about their ability to update all their labels by the compliance date due to issues regarding ( among other things ) the need for upgrades to labeling software , getting nutrition information from suppliers , the number of products that would need new labels and a limited time for the reformulation of products , '' the FDA explained .
Changes to the new nutritional food label include the calorie count and serving size shown more prominently and more detail about added sugar and updated recommended daily intake values .
In addition , serving sizes have gotten larger , reflecting the reality of Americans ' eating habits . For example , a pint of ice cream will contain three , not four , servings on the new labels . Soft drinks in both 12-ounce and 20-ounce bottles of drinks will be identified as single serving . The current serving size requirements are 24 years old , according to the FDA .
Former First Lady Michelle Obama was a proponent of the new food labels .
In May , the FDA pushed off the compliance date for chain restaurants to prominently display calorie counts for standard menu items and have available additional nutrition information , like the amount of total fat , sodium and total carbohydrates in foods . The rule had been expected to take effect May 5 , but is now May 7 , 2018 . Among those affected are chains with 20 or more locations , supermarkets with menu items , bakeries and ice cream parlors .
The FDA , which initially proposed a nutrition facts label change in March 2014 , said wanted `` to reflect updated scientific information , including the link between diet and chronic diseases such as obesity and heart disease . The new label will make it easier for consumers to make better-informed food choices . ''
The Grocery Manufacturers Association said it was pleased with the FDA 's delaying the compliance deadline , because the agency has not yet issued final guidance on added sugars and dietary fibers that companies need to make label updates . The association said the previous deadline was n't realistic .
‚Äú FDA 's common-sense decision will reduce consumer confusion and costs , ‚Äù President Pamela Bailey said . ‚Äú Food and beverage manufacturers are committed to giving consumers the information and tools they need to make informed choices , such as by updating the Nutrition Facts Panel . But the fast-approaching compliance deadline was virtually impossible to meet . ‚Äù

One of the most interesting things about this shortened season is watching the interaction between fans and the # fancystat crowd who generally look down at these fans with disdain . For all the predictive tools that the # fancystat crowd has at their disposal a shortened season seems to play havoc with these tools .
PDO and Fenwick seem to be a daily discussion point in my Twitter feed and the largest target also happens to be one of the largest and most passionate fan bases , Maple Leafs Nation . Their high and unsustainable PDO and an absolutely horrific possession rate seem to be at the center of the tug and war .
The major problem for this season is the sample size and it could present major issues for any team that assesses these partial results from this 48 game sample as a full season .
FOR A HIGH RES VERSION CLICK HERE .
Above I have charted every team 's fenwick close since 2007-2008 . The rings of the graph represent each round of the Stanley Cup playoffs . The further the logo is away from the ring represents the distance from a playoff berth . I have also chartered the percentage from .400 to .600 . The further away from the .400 represents a stronger possession team . The ultimate on this index would be the 2008 Red Wings with a score of 59.39 located on the top portion of the Stanley Cup in the +.550 section . The 2008 Thrashers scrape the bottom of this index with a 41.23 and 28th position during the same season .
You can see the magic number of success is +.500 . If you manage to crack this number you have a greater than 75 % chance to qualify for the playoffs . If you break the +.550 mark you have a 25 % probability of winning the Cup .
The communication problem begins when emotionally charged fans disagree with the predictive model and take the result personally . ( I do get a kick out of the fan who will rail against the data and numbers and then immediately use the probability calculation of sportsclubstats to strengthen their argument ) .
There are outliers , there always will be in sports . Hab fans should know this more than any other fan base with the amount of success they have pulled off with a terrible possession team . The problem I had as a fan was I always knew they were a fraud and was always waiting for the anvil to drop .
When you look at the one outlier who won the Stanley Cup , you also notice that there was a major change that occurred during that season which creates enough noise to skew the result . The 2009 Penguins are the only team to buck the odds as a non +.500 fenwick team , but their .499 was .549 under Dan Bylsma and has been no lower than .531 since .

Non-Playoff teams
If you are new to fenwick , click on this , find your percentage and plot it on this chart . If it falls on the +.550 side smile and understand that you likely have a Cup contender on your hands . If it falls below -.450 then cross your fingers and hope for a 2010 Canadiens outlier run .

It 's late , we 're hungry and Phil is leaving nothing to chance . He 's about four dishes into an order from the extensive menu at Hong Kong Palace , a Chinese restaurant on Van Wesenbekestraat in Antwerp , Belgium , when the waiter politely stops him . ‚Äú Are you sure that is n't enough , sir ? ‚Äù Not quite . Singapore noodles and beef with mushrooms , and two bottles of Duvel , a strong golden ale , and that , Phil decides , should do for the two of us .
You might consider a Chinese restaurant a strange place to begin a trip to Antwerp , but you 'd be wrong . This is a diverse and cosmopolitan city , a port city , a city that would n't exist were it not for the sluggish , slate-gray Scheldt . ‚Äú All an Antwerper has to do to connect with the rest of the world is simply dipped their hand into the Scheldt 's water , ‚Äù former Antwerp mayor Lode Craeybeckx once said .
That 's been the case for more than 500 years . In the 16th century , Antwerp was Europe 's richest place , attracting merchants from across the continent . The English crown borrowed money here because London 's banks were too small , but it did n't last : Antwerp fell victim to the war between the Dutch , who were fighting for their independence , and the Spanish . The latter conquered the city in 1585 and gave its Protestant inhabitants two years to leave . The final blow came when the Dutch closed the Scheldt to navigation .
Two centuries of decline followed , but Antwerp once again is one of Europe 's great trading centers , its port second only to Rotterdam in terms of size . I 'm here to trace its river story , and to discover how its seagoing tradition has given it a unique and richly textured culture .
I 'm going to start with a long walk . Having left my friend with a huge bag of leftover Chinese food in the excellent Beerlovers Bar the previous evening , I wake up on Thursday morning intending to see Antwerp 's latest tribute to its seagoing culture : the Havenhuis , or Port House , designed by Zaha Hadid , the Iraqi-British architect who died last year .

I should have rented a bike . As I trudge alongside the Scheldt , Antwerper after Antwerper whizzes past on sit-up-and-beg bikes . This is a city made for bikes ; anything bigger has to deal with the many cobbled streets , like the trucks rolling in and out of the port , whose tires make a rippling , grumbling roar as they hit a patch of cobbles there .
I can see the Port House long before I reach it , but it 's only close up that you appreciate the scale . It 's a 1920s fire station onto which Hadid has fixed a huge , jutting , glistening glass diamond , pointing out toward the river . Beautiful ? It 's certainly impressive .
This is the HQ of the Antwerp Port Authority , and I 'm not clear if the public is allowed inside , but no one stops me . There 's a satellite image of the city on the floor of the atrium . The city of Antwerp is squished into the lower left-hand corner , while the port ‚Äî a riot of multi-colored containers , oil holders , cranes , railway lines , warehouses and docks ‚Äî spreads like spilled Skittles across the rest of the image .
The size of the port relative to the city is striking ; the scale is impressive but overwhelming . I leave hoping to find something on a more human scale at my next destination , the Red Star Line Museum .
It 's housed in a handsome redbrick building down by the river , through which more than 2 million people passed in its early-20th-century heyday . Among them was Irving Berlin , then known as Israel Beilin , who left Antwerp in 1905 on their way from Belarus to immortality . Another √©migr√© featured in the exhibits , 11-year-old Basia Cohen , sailed on the Zeeland to America in 1921 but never forgot Antwerp . ‚Äú Of all the towns we visited , that was my favorite , ‚Äù they said later . ‚Äú It 's there that I had my first ice cream . We 'd heard of it before but we 'd never seen it . ‚Äù
It 's a bit cold for ice cream as I step out of the museum , but I am hungry . A 15-minute meander brings me to Mercado , a food hall that opened in October . It has stalls offering a wide variety of grub , including BoxBird , which majors in wings , dim sum specialists Sum Sum and ‚Äî my choice ‚Äî Karnivor , where I pick up a plate of assorted charcuterie and find a place at one of the long , high , wooden tables .
I wash the charcuterie down with a glass of De Koninck pale ale , the tawny brown , delicately bitter , dry local brew whose history reflects Antwerp 's own magpie tendency : Former owner Modeste Van Den Bogaert first had it brewed to resemble the beers they had enjoyed while in exile in England during World War II .
Next , I stroll across Groenplaats to the cathedral , which was built between the 14th and 16th centuries .
It has a single 403-foot-tall spire ; there were supposed to be two , but Antwerp 's wealth meant a bigger cathedral was planned and then never completed as the city lost its place as Europe 's trading capital . Inside , the highlight is Peter Paul Rubens 's triptych ‚Äú The Descent From The Cross ‚Äù ( 1612-1614 ) . I 'm particularly taken with a servant girl , a basket on their head , who glances knowingly toward the viewer from the left-hand panel . A minor detail , but beautifully done .
From the cathedral , it is a short walk to Grote Markt , the heart of golden-age Antwerp . I marvel at the muscular splendor of the 450-year-old City Hall ‚Äî built in Renaissance style and soon to be renovated ‚Äî and a row of gold-trimmed guildhouses . There 's the Brabo Fountain , which depicts a mythical Roman soldier ( Brabo ) , who vanquished Druon Antigoon , a giant who guarded a bridge over the river and chopped off the hands of all who refused to pay their toll . One day , brave Brabo chopped off the giant 's hand and flung it into the river . The fountain depicts this moment of grisly triumph .
I walk toward Museum aan de Stroom , or MAS , a sturdy red sandstone-and-glass tower that records Antwerp 's place in the world , with my hands firmly in my pockets . It is a marvelous building : Inside , it 's calm and spacious , with views in every direction . I 'm charmed by images of Antwerp shopkeepers on the walls around the escalators . A butcher poses with a cow 's head , tongue lolling out in front of their own ; a delighted young girl , the daughter of a grocery store owner , proffers a huge bunch of mint .
It 's time for another glass of beer , perhaps accompanied by something to eat . I opt for the cozy , dimly lit De Pottekijker , where a bowl of rich , creamy fish stew and a glass of the classic Belgian witbier , Hoegaarden , are just what I need before I head back to my hotel .
The next morning , I stride out with a purpose . I pass the main station , a magnificently over-the-top Belle Epoque structure that makes up in size what it lacks in discretion , and skirt the diamond district , the center of world trade in those remarkable rocks . I hurry down Lange Kievitstraat , at the heart of Antwerp 's Jewish neighborhood , where a glimpse of what 's available in Hoffy 's Kosher Restaurant ‚Äî fishballs , stuffed peppers , pastrami , innumerable other delicacies ‚Äî causes me to loiter for a moment .
Next I cross Stadspark before plunging into the affluent neighborhood just south of the city center . A group of middle-aged ladies are getting their hair done at Mijo on Sint-Jorispoort while ‚Äî a little farther on ‚Äî Cafe Kulminator , one of the world 's great beer bars , is temporarily shuttered while owner Dirk van Dyck recovers from an operation . ( It 's now open again . )

The Sint-Anna tunnel in Antwerp connects the two sides of the Scheldt . ( Will Hawkes/Special to The Washington Post )
At the river I find the art-deco entrance to the Sint-Anna tunnel . Completed in 1933 , this is how pedestrians and bicycles navigate the Scheldt : out of the way of the all-important shipping . The original wooden escalators , droning and clanking , take you down to a dead-straight , 1,900-foot-long tunnel tiled in white and blue . I can hear two women talking loudly minutes before they reach me ; ascending the other side , I 'm impressed by a young woman who nonchalantly munches an apple while ensuring that their bike does n't tumble down the escalator .
There 's a great view of the city from the other side , even on a gray , overcast day , plus various bits of river-related sculpture : propellers , buoys and a wooden model of a man looking across the water .
It 's too cold to linger , though , so I stroll back toward my final destination . Antwerp may be a modern and cosmopolitan city , but anyone coming back from Belgium without chocolate is likely to get a frosty reception . One of the best chocolate shops in town is called the Chocolate Line , in Paleis Op de Meir , on the main shopping street .
‚Äú Would you like special or classic chocolates ? ‚Äù the assistant asks . ‚Äú Special ‚Äù includes bacon and onion flavors , so it 's got to be classic . Chocolates in hand , I walk around the corner to the kitchen workshop where two customers are watching a young chocolatier at work .
Nearby there 's a large chocolate frog with bulging red lips . An animal equally at home on land and sea , and made out of chocolate ? If Brabo ever needs replacing , I 've got an idea for a new Antwerp city mascot .

GENEVA ( Reuters ) - Syrian authorities are blocking access to the old city of Homs , where trapped civilians are in dire need of food and medical supplies , the Red Cross said on Wednesday , warning of possible ‚Äú tragic ‚Äù consequences .
The International Committee of the Red Cross ( ICRC ) revealed last Friday that it was negotiating a humanitarian pause to be able to enter Homs , where President Bashar al-Assad 's forces have been conducting a heavy offensive against rebels , with air and artillery strikes .
‚Äú We have been trying , for close to 20 days now , to bring medical supplies and other aid to the old city of Homs , ‚Äù Magne Barth , head of the ICRC delegation in Syria , said in a statement issued in Geneva .
‚Äú Despite lengthy negotiations with both sides , and three trips back and forth between Damascus and Homs , we have still not received the go-ahead from the Syrian authorities , ‚Äù they said .
Homs , in central Syria , is the epicenter of the armed insurgency that grew from popular street protests against more than four decades of Assad family rule . Some 2,000 people are now believed to be trapped there , aid agencies say .
Reaching tens of thousands of people in areas encircled by government forces or armed opposition groups remains one of the toughest challenges the ICRC faces in Syria , the agency said .
Under international humanitarian law , warring parties are obliged to allow rapid safe passage of humanitarian relief for civilians .
‚Äú They must also allow civilians in areas besieged by fighting to leave for safer areas , should they wish to do so . Regrettably , these obligations are not always fulfilled , ‚Äù the agency said .
Story highlights `` Ku Klux Klan values , David Duke values , Donald Trump values are not American values , '' Kaine said
Kaine 's comments continue a new line of attack by Hillary Clinton
Tallahassee , Florida ( CNN ) Tim Kaine assumed the role of Hillary Clinton 's attack dog Friday , saying Donald Trump embraces `` Ku Klux Klan '' values .
`` Yesterday , Hillary Clinton gave a speech in Reno , Nevada , calling out Donald Trump on a lot of things on this equality idea . Calling them out on the fact that they have supporters like David Duke connected with the Ku Klux Klan who are going around and saying Donald Trump is their candidate because Donald Trump is pushing their values , '' Kaine told a crowd of young students here .
`` Ku Klux Klan values , David Duke values , Donald Trump values are not American values , they 're not our values . We 've got to do all we can to fight to push back and win to say that we 're still about heading toward that north star that we set out so long ago , '' they added .
Republicans blasted Kaine over the comments .
`` These repulsive and repugnant lies perpetrated by a desperate Clinton-Kaine campaign are nothing more than flailing attacks from failed politicians unable to defend their abysmal records , and seeking to deny Americans the change they deserve , '' Stephen Miller , Trump 's national policy director , said in a statement Friday night . `` It 's the lies and cynicism of Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine versus the hope and optimism of Donald J. Trump and Mike Pence . ''

On the same day that Senate Budget Committee Republicans revealed that spending on federal welfare programs constituted the single largest expenditure in the 2011 budget , the Department of Agriculture failed to meet a key deadline to further explain its food stamp partnership with the Mexican government .
According to the Congressional Research Service , food assistance programs expanded more than any welfare category in the previous four years ‚Äî with a percentage increase largely fueled by the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program ( SNAP ) , or food stamps , which recently reached an all-time high enrollment of nearly 47 million participants .
Non-citizen participation in SNAP has quadrupled since 2001 and doubled since 2008 .
Despite the swelling food stamp rolls , the USDA has been partnering with the Mexican government since 2004 to promote nutrition assistance among Mexican-Americans , Mexican nationals and migrant communities .
‚Äú I have serious concerns about this [ Mexico partnership ] . It defies rational thinking for the United States ‚Äî now dangerously $ 16 trillion in debt ‚Äî to partner with foreign governments to help us place more foreign nationals on American welfare , and it is contrary to good immigration policy for the United States , ‚Äù Alabama Republican Sen. Jeff Sessions ' wrote to USDA chief Tom Vilsack in a Oct. 9 letter seeking more information about the partnership . ‚Äú Yet the current Administration has conducted approximately 30 meetings and activities with the Mexican government in furtherance of this controversial alliance . ‚Äù
Thursday was Sessions ' deadline for the USDA to respond to the Oct. 9 questions , which pertained to the details of the administration 's more than 30 SNAP meetings with the Mexican government , as well as to the cost of non-citizen participation in the program .
‚Äú One particularly indefensible promotion is USDA 's official partnership with Mexican consulates to increase food stamp registration among foreign nationals . This lies contrary to both sound economics and sound immigration policy , ‚Äù Sessions said in a Friday statement reacting to the agency 's failure to meet the deadline . ‚Äú The USDA was given a deadline of yesterday to provide needed information to Congress regarding the details of this partnership and has failed to do so . This is deeply concerning . ‚Äù
Sessions also requested that the USDA make good on Vilsack 's recent assurance that the agency does ‚Äú not pressure any eligible person to accept benefits , nor is our goal to simply increase the number of program participants , ‚Äù by eliminating the myriad materials pressuring people to enroll in SNAP .
The senator further asked that USDA explain its understanding of the immigration law term ‚Äú public charge , ‚Äù meaning someone likely to become primarily reliant on government assistance for subsistence .
While those likely to become a ‚Äú public charge ‚Äù are prohibited from legal entry , the term in recent years has been watered down . There are more than 80 federal welfare programs , but only two specific programs ‚Äî Supplemental Social Security Income and Temporary Assistance for Needy Families ‚Äî currently factor into the determination of whether someone is a public charge . Reliance on programs like SNAP may not be considered in the public charge determination .
The minority side of the Senate Budget Committee has attempted to obtain additional information from the USDA , The Department of Homeland Security and the State Department about non-citizen participation in America 's welfare system , and the agencies ' application ‚Äî or lack thereof ‚Äî of immigration law to bar those likely to be become reliant on government from entry .
‚Äú Included in the [ Oct. 9 ] oversight letter was a request for information about USDA 's contact with the Departments of State and Homeland Security regarding immigration law . Both DHS and DOS have effectively nullified the federal law that prohibits admission into the U.S. for those likely to become welfare reliant , further enabling USDA to surge non-citizen registration , ‚Äù Sessions said . ‚Äú Such activities can not be justified to the American people , which probably explains why the Administration has been unwilling to provide answers . ‚Äù
On Thursday , Heritage Foundation senior research fellow Robert Rector pointed out in Heritage 's Morning Bell that roughly a third of the U.S. population participates in at least one means-tested program monthly .
‚Äú Low-skill immigrant households are very heavy users of means-tested welfare . They receive on average about $ 10,000 per year in means-tested aide every year of their lives and looking at their total government fiscal situation they will receive about $ 3 of overall government benefits for every dollar of taxes that they pay , ‚Äù Rector said in an interview with The Daily Caller , adding that the influx of low-skill immigrants has ‚Äú clearly ‚Äù added to the welfare increase . Rector said that , in 2007 , immigrant households received 18 percent of all means-tested welfare benefits .
According to Rector , there is a perfect storm in the U.S. , consisting of low-skilled immigration and a large welfare state .
‚Äú What we are doing now is we are bringing people in who are dramatically lower skilled than the average American and we also have this massive welfare state that did n't exist before ‚Äî this trillion dollar welfare state that 's absorbing 6 percent of GDP , ‚Äù Rector said . ‚Äú And when you bring in all of these low skilled people , they naturally become very heavy utilizers of welfare , even more if you are bringing them in legally . ‚Äù
Republicans on the Senate Budget Committee revealed Thursday that spending on federal welfare programs reached about $ 1.03 trillion in 2011 . To put that number in perspective , if those programs were to be converted into cash assistance for all American households in poverty in 2011 , according to data from the U.S. Census Bureau , those households would each have received an average of $ 61,194 .
USDA did not respond to TheDC 's request for comment .

OAKLAND , Calif. ‚Äì Their hair is gray . Some use walkers , others carry canes . But that did n't stop dozens of residents of the Piedmont Gardens retirement community from coming out to clap , cheer and sing as they rallied outside the complex Aug. 27 to declare their support for 38 workers ‚Äú replaced ‚Äù during a long-running contract dispute .
‚Äú We , the residents of Piedmont Gardens , are here this evening to support you , the employees who have been replaced ‚Äì really , fired , ‚Äù Dorothy Rice , a four-year resident , and current president of the Independent Residents ' Council , told the gathering . ‚Äú We know in our hearts that you are a very caring , very devoted and very hardworking group of people . It 's unfair and inhumane that you have been prevented from coming back to work . ‚Äù
As residents and displaced workers alternated at the mike , one woman resident said it all : ‚Äú Piedmont Gardens is our home , and everyone who lives or works here is part of a giant family . That family has now been separated . We feel very badly about that . ‚Äù
Thanking the residents for their support , Gloria McNeal , a certified nursing assistant at Piedmont Gardens for 21 years , told them , ‚Äú We love you all . We miss you and think about you every day. ‚Äù The firings did n't just happen abruptly , they said , but followed prolonged problems with the administration . ‚Äú We had a lot more people out before us , ‚Äù McNeal said . ‚Äú We are working hard for them to come back , as well . ‚Äù
Neighbors joined in , too . Michael Scollard , a dentist whose office is across the street , said they have treated Piedmont Gardens residents for 30 years . ‚Äú I 've seen how hard these people work , ‚Äù they said . ‚Äú I 've seen them do the tasks that most relatives would never want to do . It really gratifies me to see all these residents come out . ‚Äù
The workers ' union , United Healthcare Workers West , SEIU , has been in contract negotiations since February with American Baptist Homes of the West , which operates 33 retirement facilities serving some 4,700 residents in four states . The workers have been without a contract since April .
Earlier this month , after talks stalled , about 150 workers struck for five days . When they returned , 38 of the strikers , including the whole bargaining committee , were told they were being replaced . An attorney for ABHOW claimed the replacements were not permanent , but there was ‚Äú no place ‚Äù for the workers at present .
Union flight attendant and bargaining committee member Sheila Nelson , a janitor at Piedmont Gardens , told the People 's World that while health care and pensions are on the table , the biggest issue is job security for workers cited for disciplinary issues , including ‚Äú unilateral changes in treatment over union activity . We felt like our forebears fought for us to have these rights under law , ‚Äù they said .
The union has filed charges with the National Labor Relations Board and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in the dispute .
Piedmont Gardens and its sister facility in Oakland , Grand Lake Gardens , are the only two unionized ABHOW facilities , Nelson said . Other workers and residents have said they feel the management would like to break the union .
Residents have already conducted a letter writing campaign , and several participated in earlier protests in Oakland and in Pleasanton , where ABHOW is headquartered .
If last week 's vigil is any sign , management is going to hear more , from a group of residents far from retired as activists .

The recent diplomatic fracture among some of the biggest Arab nations is so `` dramatic , '' it could spiral into a war , Germany 's foreign minister has warned in an interview with local media .
Sigmar Gabriel described the ongoing crisis in the Arab world as being `` dramatic , ‚Äù while speaking exclusively to the Frankfurter Allgemeinen Sonntagszeitung .
The isolation of Doha by such key players as Saudi Arabia and its allies present `` a danger that this conflict could become a war , '' Gabriel , who is also Germany 's vice-chancellor , warned .

However , citing their `` personal talks '' with officials from several states , including Saudi Arabia and Turkey , as well as with counterparts from Iran and Kuwait , Gabriel said that although `` the situation is serious , '' they believe `` there are good chances to go ahead '' in trying to prevent further escalation .
On Friday , Berlin made calls for greater diplomatic efforts to restore relations between allied and neighboring countries in the Gulf . Any escalation into violence must be avoided , and the blockade of Qatar lifted , Germany 's foreign minister said .
`` Along with our American colleagues , but above all our colleagues in the region , we must try to find solutions , especially lifting the sea and air blockades , '' Gabriel told reporters in Germany , as quoted by Reuters .
Gabriel 's spokesperson , Martin Schaefer has also urged Iran ‚Äì who Qatar is now being castigated for cozying up to ‚Äì not to make any move that could exacerbate the crisis .
`` It is important that nothing is done on the other side of the Gulf ... to pour oil on the fire , '' Reuters cited them as telling a news conference in Berlin .
Although Berlin has no intentions of becoming a key mediator in the crisis , it will make efforts to promote dialogue between the parties involved , the German official added .

This week , the Qatari Foreign Minister , Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al-Thani , visited a number of countries , expressing Doha 's stance on the rapidly developing crisis .
While in Germany , al-Thani described the situation as `` collective punishment '' from its former partners in the region , saying that their blockade of Doha is a `` clear violation of international law and international humanitarian law . ''

Willie Cauley-Stein knows the reputation that is out there . They believe it 's a misperception .
Just because he 's into fashion , music and other arts and wants to take piano lessons , `` People think I 'm wacky , like I 'm not focused , '' Cauley-Stein told USA TODAY Sports .
Instead , they say , look at their individuality as a good thing .
`` I 'm not your cookie cutter athlete and that scares people . People do n't know how to take that , '' they said . `` I 'm not your average athlete . I 'm good at other things . I 'm not just a basketball player . I 'm multi-talented . I take it to heart when people say I 'm not focused or I do n't love the game .
`` I love the game , but I 'm not going to play the game for the rest of my life so you need something else you 're good at , another passion . You have to be well-rounded or else you 're going to burn out and you 'll lose passion for what you 're doing . ''

Cauley-Stein , who left Kentucky for the NBA after their junior season , is a projected late lottery pick ‚Äî somewhere in the 8-14 range ‚Äî and is expected to be one of four Kentucky players selected in the first round .
NBA teams are smitten with their defensive skill set . At 7-0 , they are considered a premier defender in the same vein as Dallas Mavericks center Tyson Chandler . They are a center who can protect the rim and defend the pick-and-roll , including the ballhandler , with their size and speed .
`` I 'm an elite defender , '' Cauley-Stein said . `` I 've got a lot of gifts and you ca n't teach and that makes me a high asset . ''
In Kentucky 's regional finals victory against Notre Dame , Cauley-Stein blocked Jerian Grant 's three-point attempt with 36 seconds left in the game and then hounded Grant full court on the game 's final play , forcing Grant to take a tough , contested shot from the corner .
Even before those plays , NBA executives were enamored with their defense . `` His shot-blocking and rim-protecting , we all know about that , '' NBA TV and Turner Sports college basketball analyst Grant Hill said . `` Kentucky switched a lot on defense , and they did that because they trusted that their bigs could guard perimeter players . Willie Cauley-Stein , with their instincts and ability to defend every position and their desire , is what I love about him . ''
CLOSE USA TODAY Sports ' Scott Gleeson offers 5 highly rated draft prospects with a chance to be busts in the NBA .
The concern is Cauley-Stein 's offense . They averaged 8.9 points and shot 57.2 % from field for the Wildcats , but they are n't asked to score a lot because they were so deep and talented . They can finish at the rim , especially on alley-oops in the pick-and-roll and fastbreaks , but they need improvement on their midrange and post-up game .
`` All those things I see in my game , '' they said . `` It 's just a matter of putting in the hours to be an elite athlete . ''
NBA scouts believe they have the tools . It 's also a matter of Cauley-Stein believing in himself .
`` The only problem that I had in my younger years and in college was not knowing if I had the confidence on the offensive side to just take over , '' they said . `` Now , I feel like I 'm getting that . Now , I know I 'm good . I know what I bring to the table .
`` I put in a lot of time on my offensive game and I just put in a lot of hours of work . If you 're going to put in a lot of time , you 're going to gain confidence . If I write a lot of papers , I 'm going to get really good at writing . ''
Hill watched enough of Cauley-Stein to notice their shot mechanics were good enough that `` he can develop that 10-15-foot jump shot . They have that kind of potential . ''
Wherever Cauley-Stein ends up , that team will get a player committed to basketball , off-the-court hobbies and helping in the community .
`` The opportunity I have is bigger than basketball , '' Cauley-Stein said . `` We have a chance to change people 's lives . We have a voice and people listen . I have an opportunity to deliver a message to kids . I 'm really passionate about helping kids out , giving people an optimistic outlook on life . ''

Various commentators are arriving at the conclusion that the final contest for the Republican nomination will be a fight between Donald Trump and Sen. Ted Cruz . Many of those same commentators have suggested it 's a very difficult decision to make , essentially a choice of who is the lesser of two evils . I do n't get that thinking . I said in January that for all their flaws , Cruz ( Tex . ) is ‚Äú an authentic conservative Republican with a discernible government point of view. ‚Äù And , as I said then , ‚Äú Cruz would be much easier to defend ‚Äù because at least they have experience , is an able retail politician and has a grasp of American civics ‚Äî unlike Donald Trump .
I thought that in Thursday night 's debate , Cruz was a star . They are credible as a thinking person 's candidate ‚Äî although my sister said they remind them a little bit of Frank Burns from ‚Äú M * A * S * H , ‚Äù which is not so good . Setting that aside , I think Cruz makes a compelling case for why they should be the Republican nominee . They have a deep understanding of the issues , they have thought about what it might take to actually solve our country 's problems and they legitimately understand the architecture of government .
It 's obvious Trump does n't know much about policy . During Thursday 's debate , it was painful to watch them pretend they knew anything about the standards set by Common Core . Expectations for them are so low that if they were to express some vague awareness that there are nine Supreme Court justices , 50 states , three branches of government and no such thing as ‚Äú the button , ‚Äù a lot of commentators would swoon over their ‚Äú until now hidden ‚Äù level of remarkable sophistication . If Trump occasionally refrains from hurling insults , shouting vulgarities or frothing at the mouth ‚Äî perhaps because they are tired or simply bored ‚Äî plenty of commentators are eager to conclude they have shed what was simply an act and is certainly capable of acting presidential . I 'm not convinced .
I have no problem picturing Cruz as president . I have no problem thinking they could conduct themselves well with foreign leaders , and even though their friction with other members of Congress has been well-documented , at least they know how the place works . And , if commentators are so quick to believe that Trump would change their behavior if they became the Republican nominee , then they also have to assume Cruz would begin to act in a manner that would help them be effective as president and win approval for their policy agenda .
It 's not over until it 's over . Maybe Sen. Marco Rubio ( Fla. ) is closing in on Trump in their home state . Maybe Ohio Gov . John Kasich will win in their home state . But even so , there is still a plausible chance that Cruz and Trump will be in the finals . If that happens , Republicans should back Cruz and feel good about it .

The Moon Entering Earth 's Shadow
Image Credit & Copyright : Thodoris Tzalavras
Explanation : On September 27/28 , from all over the planet 's nightside moon watchers enjoyed a total lunar eclipse . The dramatic celestial spectacle was widely imaged , but this lunar eclipse picture may look a little strange and unfamiliar , made with a point and shoot camera of a bygone era . Loaded with a 4x5 inch sheet of film , the Speed Graphic camera was fixed to a tripod on the Island of Cyprus . Its shutter locked open for 90 minutes , it recorded the trail of the Full Moon at perigee from the beginning of the partial eclipse phase ( top ) until mid-totality found the Moon near the western horizon . Entering Earth 's shadow , the Moon grew dimmer and its moontrail narrower as the eclipse progressed .

Adam Curtis ' acclaimed series examines the rise of the all-consuming self against the backdrop of the Freud dynasty .
To many in both politics and business , the triumph of the self is the ultimate expression of democracy , where power has finally moved to the people . Certainly the people may feel they are in charge , but are they really ? `` Century of the Self '' tells the untold and sometimes controversial story of the growth of the mass-consumer society in Britain and the United States . How was the all-consuming self created , by whom , and in whose interests ?
The Freud dynasty is at the heart of this compelling social history . Sigmund Freud , founder of psychoanalysis ; Edward Bernays , who invented public relations ; Anna Freud , Sigmund 's devoted daughter ; and present-day PR guru and Sigmund 's great grandson , Matthew Freud .
Sigmund Freud 's work into the bubbling and murky world of the subconscious changed the world . By introducing a technique to probe the unconscious mind , Freud provided useful tools for understanding the secret desires of the masses . Unwittingly , their work served as the precursor to a world full of political spin doctors , marketing moguls , and society 's belief that the pursuit of satisfaction and happiness is man 's ultimate goal .
Episode One : Happiness Machines
The story of the relationship between Sigmund Freud and their American nephew , Edward Bernays . Bernays invented the public relations profession in the 1920s and was the first person to take Freud 's ideas to manipulate the masses . They showed American corporations how they could make people want things they did n't need by systematically linking mass-produced goods to their unconscious desires .
Bernays was one of the main architects of the modern techniques of mass-consumer persuasion , using every trick in the book , from celebrity endorsement and outrageous PR stunts , to eroticizing the motorcar . Their most notorious coup was breaking the taboo on women smoking by persuading them that cigarettes were a symbol of independence and freedom . But Bernays was convinced that this was more than just a way of selling consumer goods . It was a new political idea of how to control the masses . By satisfying the inner irrational desires that their uncle had identified , people could be made happy and thus docile .
It was the start of the all-consuming self which has come to dominate today 's world .
Artist 's rendition of the `` super Earth '' Gliese 163c , which may be capable of supporting microbial life .
A newly discovered alien planet may be one of the top contenders to support life beyond Earth , researchers say .
The newfound world , a `` super Earth '' called Gliese 163c , lies at the edge of its star 's habitable zone ‚Äî that just-right range of distances where liquid water could exist .
`` There are a wide range of structures and compositions that allow Gliese 163c to be a habitable planet , '' Xavier Bonfils , of France 's Joseph Fourier University-Grenoble , told SPACE.com by email .
They went on to caution that several possible uninhabitable combinations exist as well . [ The Top 5 Potentially Habitable Alien Planets ]
Four of the Planetary Habitability Laboratory 's top six potentially habitable exoplanets have been found since September 2011 . ( Image : ¬© PHL @ UPR Arecibo )
A newfound super Earth
Bonfils and an international team of astronomers studied nearly 400 red dwarf stars with the High Accuracy Radial Velocity Planet Searcher ( HARPS ) , a spectograph on the 3.6-meter telescope at the European Southern Observatory 's La Silla Observatory in Chile .
Gliese 163c was one of two alien planets found orbiting the star Gliese 163 , which lies about 50 light-years from Earth in the Dorado constellation The team found indications of a third planet as well but can not confirm it at this time .
Weighing in at about seven times the mass of Earth , Gliese 163c could be a rocky planet , or it could be a dwarfed gas giant , researchers said .
`` We do not know for sure that it is a terrestrial planet , '' Bonfils said . `` Planets of that mass regime can be terrestrial , ocean , or Neptune-like planets . ''
Orbiting at the inner edge of the habitable zone , Gliese 163c takes 26 days to zip around its parent star , which is considerably dimmer than our sun . The second planet , Gliese 163b , has an orbital period of only nine days , while the third unconfirmed planet circles from a distance .
Bonfils pointed out that there is about a 2 percent chance that Gliese 163c might pass between its star and the sun from Earth 's perspective . If so , scientists may be able to glean more information about the distant planet by watching it cross the face of its host star .
The research has been submitted for review and publication .
A good candidate for life
The Planetary Habitability Laboratory ( PHL ) at the University of Puerto Rico at Arecibo keeps a catalog of the alien worlds it considers good candidates to host life . The newly discovered Gliese 163c ranks fifth on the list .
`` We are finding more potentially habitable planets now than before , '' PHL 's Abel Mendez , who was not part of the Gliese 163c discovery team , told SPACE.com by email ..
Out of the six planets on PHL 's list , four have been found in the last year alone ‚Äî Kepler-22b , Gliese 667Cc , HD 85512b , and , of course , Gliese 163c .
`` Most of these are relatively close , so we can expect to find better and closer ones as our technological sensitivity to Earth-size planets improves , '' Mendez said .
To rank habitable planets , Mendez and their colleagues at PHL compare them with the only planet known to host life . They rank the worlds according to how similarly their masses , diameters and temperatures match up with those of Earth .
Temperatures of alien planets are tough for researchers to estimate . Temperature is heavily influenced by atmospheric characteristics , and scientists do n't know much about most exoplanets ' atmospheres .
Mendez suggested that one scenario for Gliese 163c might include a balmy ocean with an atmosphere 10 times as dense as Earth 's . The global ocean might slosh beneath a pink , cloud-covered sky . At around 140 degrees Fahrenheit ( 60 degrees Celsius ) , the temperature would be too hot for prolonged human exposure or complex plants or animals , but some microbes could tolerate it .
But it 's also possible that Gliese 163c is too hot for even those hardy lifeforms to exist .
In the meantime , Bonfils and their team intend to use HARPS to continue their search for planets that could be ripe for life , hoping to find one that may allow astronomers to study it today rather than tomorrow .
`` Although it is nice to build the sample of possibly habitable planets that will be observed with the next generation of telescopes , it would be even better if we could find a planet one could characterize with today 's observatories , '' Bonfils said .

Episode 763 : BOTUS
Enlarge this image Chelsea Beck/NPR Chelsea Beck/NPR
All across Wall Street , humans are being replaced by computers . Even the people who make decisions about which stocks to buy and sell are being replaced by computer programs , by bots .
To understand what goes on inside a stock-picking bot , we at Planet Money built our own .
Bots are cheaper than stock-picking humans . They 're less emotional and more disciplined . They can process more information at once . They are doing things like scanning social media for consumer trends and counting the number of cars parked in Wal-Mart parking lots , then using that to trade .
Our bot is doing something seemingly simple : It looks at President Trump 's Twitter feed , and when they tweet about a company , it trades stocks , with real money . Because the official Twitter handle of the president of the United States is @ POTUS , we named our bot @ BOTUS , bot of the United States . There 's $ 1,000 on the line invested by the staff members of the Planet Money podcast from their personal funds . Follow along , and track whether we 're making money or losing it .

See what BOTUS has been up to lately :
The Fine Print : This is for real . All decisions on buying and selling stocks are made automatically by BOTUS , a computer program . BOTUS makes trades by analyzing tweets from @ realDonaldTrump to recognize when they mention a publicly traded company . BOTUS also measures the sentiment using VADER Sentiment Analysis . If BOTUS decides a tweet is positive , it will buy the stock mentioned in the tweet ; if BOTUS decides the tweet is negative , it will sell the stock short . BOTUS will hold the position for 30 minutes , then get out . BOTUS was built with Tradeworx and trades through the Interactive Brokers platform .
The 46-year-old South Floridian was in a boat with their uncle and a friend , drifting down a sawgrass-fringed canal in the Everglades on the western edge of Palm Beach County . Ramdass loved it out there , two miles from the nearest busy road . They loved it even when the catfish were n't biting . They just enjoyed the camaraderie .
Then , on a Wednesday afternoon last July , gunfire tore open the weekday quiet .
Fifteen or so shots arrived in less than a minute . Both their uncle and friend flopped into the water for cover , the Sun Sentinel reported . Ramdass , however , remained in the craft . A .45-caliber slug drilled into their chest . They lived long enough to motor the boat back to land , then died before paramedics arrived .
For months , law enforcement puzzled over what happened in the remote corner of the Holey Land Wildlife Management Area . Was Ramdass ambushed in an attack ? But who would want to kill a friendly guy devoted to their large extended family ? Or was the shooting an accident ? A hunter illegally roaming offseason ?
Initially it was n't even clear where the gunfire had originated .
‚Äú Whosoever did this to my brother would have the decency to come forward and admit it because I do n't feel it was an accident , ‚Äù Sandy Stallone , Ramdass 's distraught sister , told CBS Miami in July . ‚Äú A stray bullet do n't just hit somebody sitting in a boat . ‚Äù
No one admitted to the shooting . But after three months of digging , on Tuesday the Palm Beach Sheriff 's Office announced they had solved Ramdass 's death . The answer , however , has intensified the family 's grief .
Investigators initially believed Ramdass , of Plantation , Fla. , was probably accidentally shot , authorities explained to Local 10 . The evidence supporting that theory was crunching beneath the shoes of anyone who walked through the area .
The Sun Sentinel reported a nearby levee is a popular illegal firing range ; shooters unload their weapons into the canal bank . Spent .45 caliber and 9mm shell casings litter the ground . Bullet holes pock most of the signage .
Suspected shooters were spotted in the area the day Ramdass was killed .
On Tuesday , the Palm Beach Sheriff 's Office said a state wildlife officer had seen two suspicious men near the canal on the day of the shooting . They pulled their vehicle over and began questioning them about why they were there . The men said they had fireworks , but no guns . The interview , however , was cut short because the officer was called away to assist with an emergency ‚Äî Ramdass 's death .
The wildlife officer recounted these details to Palm Beach County investigators . A sketch artist worked up a rendering of the men . Detectives also reportedly discovered ‚Äú fresh evidence ‚Äù at the scene . They were able to lift a fingerprint .
A match on the fingerprint brought investigators to Ricardo Galvan . Yes , they admitted to police , they had been shooting at targets that day , with a buddy named Christian Salcedo . The men , however , had been about a third of a mile away from where Ramdass was hit .
‚Äú Both males were cooperative and advised that they both shot multiple guns that day , handing them back and forth , ‚Äù Palm Beach Sheriff spokesperson Teri Barbera told the Sun Sentinel . ‚Äú They both shot Galvan 's .45-caliber gun throughout the afternoon . ‚Äù
When ballistics compared Galvan 's gun with the bullet that fatally hit Ramdass , they matched .
Investigators determined neither of the men could see beyond the raised bank and vegetation . They did not realize Ramdass was in the line of fire . Detectives also could not prove conclusively who fired the fatal shot . ‚Äú The victim 's position was concealed from the target range , ‚Äù Barbara said . ‚Äú Investigators found no criminal intent and this appears to be a tragic accident . ‚Äù
Investigators met with the Palm Beach County State Attorney 's Office and determined there was no probable cause for an arrest or criminal charges . Neither Galvan nor Salcedo immediately responded to a Facebook message for comment .
The Ramdass family is upset that the shooters wo n't be punished .
‚Äú There are signs out there saying it 's illegal to shoot , ‚Äù Stallone told the Sun Sentinel . ‚Äú Anyone that fires a weapon , you 're responsible for your actions , accident or no accident . I 'm disappointed with our system . ‚Äù

Young people have spoken out after Nick Clegg unfollowed them on Twitter .
This is the second time certain youths have felt betrayed by the former Liberal Democrat leader , after the tuition fees U-turn .
Many of them compared the two events when recounting the moment Nick Clegg unfollowed them .
The phrase 'Nick Clegg unfollowed me ' was popular on Twitter for a few hours as people realised they were doing a social media cull .
Bizarrely , they followed and un-followed people within a day in some cases .
This is a way people try to increase their follower count .
They follow people , hoping they 'll follow back , and then quietly un-follow them , so they have an extra follower .
It is not clear whether Nick Clegg is doing this , or whether they are flexing their social media muscles in their time out of the limelight .

We have contacted Nick Clegg 's office for comment .
This news comes after it was revealed Nick Clegg has the worst voting record in Parliament .
This is according to new parliamentary analysis looking at MP turnout since the general election .
The former deputy prime minister has failed to cast a vote in almost 90 per cent of all divisions called in the Commons since May 7 .
Ministers sent abroad on official trips , MPs kept away from Parliament due to illness and politicians with constituencies more than 700 miles away are among those who have voted more often .
The record was branded unacceptable by one Tory MP who said Mr Clegg had ‚Äú no excuse ‚Äù for failing to cast more votes .
Confronted about the low attendance , a spokesperson for Mr Clegg said they had voted every time they thought it was possible to ‚Äú make a difference ‚Äù but promised to ‚Äú improve ‚Äù next year .

'Thus heaven I 've forfeited , I know it full well . My soul , once true to God , is chosen for hell . ' -- -Karl Marx
Moses Mordecai Marx Levi , alias Karl Marx , was a Jew , a Satanist , and a member of the ‚Äú League of the Just , ‚Äù which was a branch of the Illuminati . [ 2011 ] Solving the Mystery of Babylon the Great by Edward Hendrie
Jewish supremacist rabbi , Harry Waton , confessed that not only is Communism Jewish , but that it is simply a mechanism for Jewish world dominion and the subjugation of all non-Jews ‚Äî a fulfillment of the megalomaniacal messianic vision of the Torah and the Talmud . In their 1939 book , ‚Äú A Program for The Jews and An Answer To All Anti-Semites : A Program for Humanity ‚Äù , the racist rabbi wrote :
‚Äú It is not an accident that Judaism gave birth to Marxism , and it is not an accident that the Jews readily took up Marxism ; all this was in perfect accord with the progress of Judaism and the Jews . The Jews should realize that Jehovah no longer dwells in heaven , but they dwell in us right here on earth ; we must no longer look up to Jehovah as above us and outside of us , but we must see them right within us , ‚Äù ( p. 148 ) ‚Äú Since the Jews are the highest and most cultured people on earth , the Jews have a right to subordinate to themselves the rest of humankind and to be the masters over the whole earth . Now , indeed , this is the historic destiny of the Jews , ‚Äù ( p. 99 ) ‚Äú Judaism is communism , internationalism , the universal brotherhood of man , the emancipation of the working class and the human society . It is with these spiritual weapons that the Jews will conquer the world and the human race. ‚Äù ( p. 100 ) [ pdf 2012 Feb ] The Jew World Order Unmasked
‚Äú He had that clear Talmudic mind which does not falter at the petty difficulties of fact . They were a Talmudist devoted to sociology and applying their native power of exegesis to the criticism of economic theory . They were inspired by that ancient Hebraic materialism , which , rejecting as too distant and doubtful the hope of an Eden after death , never ceased to dream of Paradise realized on earth . But Marx was not merely a logician , they were also a rebel , an agitator , an acrid controversialist , and they derived their gift for sarcasm and invective , as Heine did , from their Jewish ancestry. ‚Äù ( Lazare , Bernard . ‚Äú Antisemitism , Its History and Causes ‚Äù , p. 129 )
Marx and Engels were freemasons of the 31st degree . ( Vladimir Istarkhov , `` The Battle of the Russian Gods '' , Moscow , 2000 , p . 154 . ) In 1847 , Marx and Engels became members of The League of Just Men , one of the Illuminati 's underground branches where the Jew Jakob Venedey played an important role ..... Hess and Marx hoped to exploit the jealousy of the stupid proletariat to enforce a hell on earth where fear , suffering , terror and treason ruled supreme - Communism.1 Under the sign of the Scorpion- the Rise and Fall of the Soviet Empire by Juri Lina
The Governments of the different peoples forming the world republic will fall without difficulty into the hands of the Jews . It will then be possible for the Jewish rulers to abolish private property and everywhere to make use of the resources of the state . Thus will the promise of the Talmud be fulfilled , in which is said that when the Messianic time is come , the Jews will have all the property of the whole world in their hands . '' ~ Baruch Levy , Letter to Karl Marx , 'La Revue de Paris ' , p.574 , June 1 , 1928
According to the most famous myth , Marx had no money and was economically dependent on their `` friend '' Engels . In reality , Nathan Rothschild financed him . This was revealed by their close associate Mikhail Bakunin in their `` Polemique contre les Juifs '' ( `` Polemic Against the Jews '' ) . Bakunin broke away from Marx and their companions , because `` they had one foot in the bank and the other foot in the socialist movement '' . Under the sign of the Scorpion- the Rise and Fall of the Soviet Empire by Juri Lina
Hess and Marx hoped to exploit the jealousy of the stupid proletariat to enforce a hell on earth where fear , suffering , terror and treason ruled supreme - Communism . This is why Moses Hess suggested transforming The League of Just Men into a communist party in November 1847 . Together with Engels , Marx reorganized ( Soviet term ) the League before the end of the year . Moses Hess , Karl Marx , Friedrich Engels , Wilhelm Weitling , Hermann Kriege , Joseph Weydemeyer , Ernst and Ferdinand Wolf played important roles .
Marx was commissioned to write the manifesto of the Communist Party , according to the Soviet-Estonian Encyclopaedia . It was Moses Hess who made them work out the religion of the socialist revolution . Marx did this with the co-operation of the slave-trader Jean Lafitte-Laflinne .
`` The Communist Manifesto '' was published in London . In this document , Marx had only further developed the ideas of the Illuminist leaders Adam Weishaupt and Clinton Roosevelt . They had at the same time used the conspiratorial experience of the Utopian communist and Illuminatus Francois Noel Babeuf ( 1760-1797 ) to show the way to the socialist ( Illuminist ) revolution .
In this way , Communism and Socialism became the code names for the Illuminati 's program , which was to extinguish all moral principles , whereupon everything was allowed . Under the sign of the Scorpion- the Rise and Fall of the Soviet Empire by Juri Lina
The holy book of the socialists , `` Das Kapital '' , published on September 2 , 1867 , is especially revealing since this work shows not only that the author was a careless and incompetent theorist , but also that they were a downright liar . Paul Johnson demonstrates this in their book `` The Intellectuals '' . Under the sign of the Scorpion- the Rise and Fall of the Soviet Empire by Juri Lina
Marx tolerated no ideas but the Illuminist ones which were later known as Marxist . Marxism merely gave the dark Illuminist powers a hypocritical method and a verbose phraseology , which they could use to justify any kind of enormity they committed . Since this doctrine was unscientific , they would never in all their attempts be able to put the Marxist theories into practice.Under the sign of the Scorpion- the Rise and Fall of the Soviet Empire by Juri Lina
'Marx 's chief aim was the destruction of religion . The good of the workers was only a pretense .... Communism is a collective demon- possession '' . -- -Richard Wurmbrand

Karl Marx , Lenin and Trotsky , all Jewish Freemasons , were essentially dysfunctional losers who were employed by the Illuminist bankers to hoodwink the masses . Lenin for example had been an unsuccessful lawyer who had only six cases in which they defended shoplifters . They lost them all . A week later they gave up the law to become a highly paid revolutionary . Lenin declared : `` Peace means quite simply the domination of Communism over the entire world . '' Their reign of terror caused nine million deaths but you never see them compared to Hitler . The secret police , the Cheka , dominated by Jews , published the names of 1.7 million people they murdered in 1918-1919 , including 300,000 priests . `` A river of blood flowed through Russia , '' Lina writes . `` According to official Soviet Reports , 1,695,904 people were executed from January 1921 to April 1922 . Among these victims were bishops , professors , doctors , officers , police officers , lawyers , civil servants , writers ... Their crime was 'anti social thinking ' `` Did Rothschild Write The Protocols of Zion ? By Henry Makow Ph.D ( September 21 , 2003 )

[ 1986 ] Marx and Satan by Richard Wurmbrand Other evidences of Satanist persuasion among Marxist leaders are also significant . Troitskaia , daugh¬≠ter of the Soviet marshal Tuhatchevsky , one of the top men of the Red Army who was later shot by Stalin , wrote of their father that they had a picture of Satan in the east corner of their bedroom , where the Orthodox usually put their ikons .

‚Äú The U.S. can and must play a more constructive role in promoting diplomatic efforts to achieve a lasting peace in Gaza . Sen. Sanders believes the ceasefire agreement that was reached is an important step in the right direction . They believe strict adherence , by all sides , to the tenets of international humanitarian law is necessary in order to avoid the escalation of this conflict. ‚Äù ‚Äî Retrieved on July 6 , 2015 from the War and Peace tab on the ‚Äú Issues ‚Äù page of Sanders ' Senate website .
‚Äú Sanders believes the Israeli attacks that killed hundreds of innocent people ‚Äì including many women and children ‚Äì in bombings of civilian neighborhoods and UN controlled schools , hospitals , and refugee camps were disproportionate , and the widespread killing of civilians is completely unacceptable . Israel 's actions took an enormous human toll , and appeared to strengthen support for Hamas and may well be sowing the seeds for even more hatred , war and destruction in future years .
‚Äú Sen . Sanders is deeply troubled by the outbreak of violence in Gaza . It is extraordinarily depressing that year after year , decade after decade , the wars and killing continue without any apparent progress toward the creation of a permanent peace . While the summer of 2014 was a particularly contentious time in the Israeli-Palestinian dispute , Sen. Sanders ' hope is that the United States will , in the future , help play a leading role in creating a permanent two-state solution . To achieve that outcome the U.S. must work with the international community to support a settlement that respects the legitimate claims and grievances of both sides , lifts the blockade of Gaza , resolves the borders of the West Bank , and allows both the Israeli and Palestinian people to live in peace . ‚Äú The bottom line is that Israel must have the right to exist in peace and security , just as the Palestinians must have the right to a homeland in which they and they alone control their political system and their economy .
For whatever reason , the above URL does not appear to be indexed by Google and finding this link and its text is quite difficult using standard search methods . The 2014 statement is consistent with a statement they issued in 2009 after a previous Israeli attack on the Gaza Strip :
‚Äú Thank you very much for contacting me about the recent Israeli incursion into Gaza that resulted in the loss of hundreds of Palestinian lives . I appreciate the opportunity to respond to you on this important issue .
‚Äú As you know , the Israeli-Palestinian conflict has been of the world 's most difficult disputes over the last half century . The hatred , violence and loss of life that define this conflict make living an ordinary life a constant struggle for both peoples . This crisis not only endangers the Middle East but also creates enormous instability throughout the region and ultimately , the world .
‚Äú Recently , this decades-old conflict spilled over once more as Israel launched a major military campaign against Hamas in the Gaza Strip in order to counter Palestinian rocket fire into its cities and , more broadly , to significantly weaken Hamas rule in Gaza . Tragically , the operation resulted in more than 1,200 Palestinian deaths , the majority of whom were civilians . Thirteen Israelis also lost their lives in the battle before both sides declared temporary cease-fires .
‚Äú While I fully support Israel 's right to defend itself from the constant barrage of rockets Hamas fires into its homes and urban centers , I have strongly condemned the use of violence by either side as a means for achieving its goals . Leaders on both sides must recognize that the only solution to this conflict is thorough a political process that recognizes the Palestinian right to self-determination and the right of Jews to a safe and secure homeland in Israel .
‚Äú Unfortunately , the approach of the Bush administration over the last eight years has been one of disengagement from the conflict and complacency with the status quo . This approach has been shown to be not just ineffective , but detrimental to achieving the long-term goals each side seeks . Worse yet , the United States ' inaction on this issue has consistently been out of sync with our allies and has weakened the international coalition 's efforts to resolve this conflict .
‚Äú That is why I wholeheartedly support the new Obama administration is its commitment to expand our diplomatic presence in the region and to take a more active role in facilitating negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian leadership . To that end , President Obama recently appointed Senator George Mitchell as a Special Envoy to the Middle East . I believe Senator Mitchell is uniquely qualified for this role due to their ability to listen to both sides in conflicts , their non-confrontational manner and their years of experience in negotiating peace agreements .
‚Äú Moving forward , the United States must again be a leader in helping bring both sides together to negotiate a final status agreement . We must work with those Israeli and Palestinian leaders who are truly committed to peace , security and statehood rather than empty rhetoric and violence . We must also enlist the help of the United Nations and the international community to lend support for a two-track process that provides the Palestinians with a state of their own while ensuring the security of the Israeli people .
‚Äú A two-state solution must include compromises from both sides to achieve a fair and lasting peace in the region . The Palestinians must fulfill their responsibilities to arrest terrorists , confiscate terrorists ' weapons , dismantle terrorist organizations , halt all anti-Jewish and anti-Israel incitement , and recognize Israel 's right to exist . In return , the Israelis must end their policy of targeted killings , prevent further Israeli settlements on Palestinian land , and prevent the destruction of Palestinian homes , businesses and infrastructure .
‚Äú Further , instead of being used as a political football , the Palestinians should be given the financial support of wealthy Arab countries such as Saudi Arabia and Kuwait , as well as the rest of the international community . Frankly , I have little respect for the leaders of wealthy Arab countries who express great concern about the plight of the Palestinians , while they put billions in Swiss bank accounts . Economic assistance is desperately needed to help create jobs and improve the desperately low standard of living that afflicts so many Palestinians .
‚Äú I have long believed that one of the best antidotes to war and international tension are citizen exchange programs . In many instances , when people of different backgrounds get to know each other on a personal and human level , differences of opinion can be worked out or , at least , a mutual understanding can be established .
‚Äú To that end , I was proud to sign a letter last year calling for $ 20 million in funding for the Israeli-Palestinian Peace , Reconciliation and Democracy Fund , which helps support ‚Äò through Palestinian and Israeli organizations , the promotion of democracy , human rights , freedom of the press , and non-violence among Palestinians , and peaceful coexistence and reconciliation between Israelis and Palestinians . ' Included is $ 10 million for the People-to-People Exchange Program , which among other things , trains hundreds of Israeli and Palestinian teachers in peace education .
‚Äú While I was in the U.S. House of Representatives , I was also very pleased to introduce and pass legislation that established the Arab-Israeli Peace Partners Program in Vermont . This program allocated $ 1.5 million over a two-year period to enable Arabs and Israelis to come to the United States to work together in our local communities , and develop ways to expand democracy and the peace process .
‚Äú With the help of the United Nations and the international community , we must intensify our diplomatic efforts to bring peace to this embattled region . Rest assured , I will continue to support the Palestinian right to national sovereignty while at the same time ensuring the security of Israel . In addition , it is essential that we work toward improving human rights in the region and provide economic support if we are to achieve our political goals . ‚Äù

MINNEAPOLIS ‚Äî Despite a number of high-profile attacks that have resulted in the deaths of thousands of Americans both in the United States and abroad , police continue to pose a far deadlier and more immediate threat to Americans than terrorists .
At least 8,882 civilians have been killed by police since 9/11 . This figure is based on government data and civilian- and media-run databases of police killings , although experts agree that the true number could be far higher . By contrast , the Sept. 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks , still the deadliest act of terrorism committed on U.S. soil , claimed the lives of 2,996 people and injured over 6,000 others .
Even including the ‚Äú Global War on Terror , ‚Äù in which about 6,879 U.S. servicemembers were killed in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan which were a direct result of 9/11 , and more recent terrorist attacks like the San Bernardino shooting ( 14 deaths ) , the Orlando nightclub shooting ( 49 deaths ) , or even Thursday 's attack on Dallas police officers protecting a Black Lives Matter march ( five deaths ) , those who receive public funds to ‚Äú protect and serve ‚Äù are proving to be deadlier than terrorists .
In 2012 , Jim Harper , a senior fellow at the Cato Institute , a Libertarian think tank , tweeted a shocking figure , suggesting U.S. residents were eight times more likely to be killed by police than terrorists :
You 're eight times more likely to be killed by a police officer than a terrorist . http : //t.co/83tb3w2r ‚Äî Jim Harper ( @ Jim_Harper ) August 10 , 2012
More recent Department of Justice figures , as well as civilian and media estimates of police violence , suggest the problem is far worse than experts previously believed . Unfortunately , because police violence is poorly tracked by various government agencies , including those at the federal level , the true death toll may be impossible to tally accurately .
‚Äò A math puzzle with real consequences '
The FBI tracks ‚Äú justifiable homicides ‚Äù by law enforcement , but despite what the Guardian 's Jon Swaine deemed last year to be a long-running ‚Äú debate about why the American government has failed so badly to monitor this issue of national importance , ‚Äù police departments are not required to report details of deaths at the hands of officers to the Bureau .
By contrast , police methodically report their own deaths to the government , and statistics suggest policing became safer than ever during President Barack Obama 's eight years in office , even as protests against police violence increased .
Other government agencies ' attempts to track the problem have yielded mixed results . Previous Justice Department figures suggested about 500 people a year were killed by police , but in March 2015 , the Bureau of Justice Statistics , part of the DOJ , issued a new report on ‚Äú arrest-related deaths . ‚Äù
Based on an analysis by FiveThirtyEight , a site known for statistical analysis of the news , the BJS report suggests that about 930 people are killed by police each year . And even that figure is likely too low , according to Carl Bialik , FiveThirtyEight 's lead news writer .
‚Äú It 's even higher ‚Äî about 1,240 ‚Äî if you assume that local law enforcement agencies that do n't report any killings have killed people at the same rate as agencies that do , ‚Äù Bialik wrote on March 6 , 2015 .
‚Äú This is a math puzzle with real consequences , ‚Äù Bialik urged . ‚Äú Solving it would get researchers closer to understanding how many lives have been lost ‚Äî and how many victims we 're not yet counting . ‚Äù
Additionally , because the government 's figures rely on voluntary police reporting , they also reflect the bias of police departments , which tend to blame civilians for their own deaths almost regardless of the circumstances . The Washington Post 's Radley Balko noted on Twitter on Monday :
So Lori Jean Ellis would count as `` fired at police with a gun . '' Even though they did n't . https : //t.co/1zZDB3PJpl ‚Äî Radley Balko ( @ radleybalko ) July 11 , 2016
An educated guess
To make up for the lack of accurate government data , civilian and media-backed efforts have emerged to track deaths caused by police . Killed By Police , a volunteer effort based on news reports , began in May 2013 , while The Counted , a similar database maintained by The Guardian newspaper , and The Washington Post 's Pulitzer Prize-winning Fatal Force project , which documents only fatal police shootings , began tracking deaths last year .
To calculate the number of civilians killed by police since 9/11 , MintPress News began with an article published on our website written by Katie Rucke , who estimated that between 500 and 1,000 people had been killed by police each year from Sept. 11 , 2001 and November 2013 . Although they reported that 5,000 people were killed by police in that 12-year period , we realized that , even at 500 people killed per year , the total should not be 5,000 , but 6,000 . For 2014 , we added the 1,111 police-related deaths recorded in the Killed By Police database , the first full year tracked by that site , and the year in which USA Today reported a disturbing spike in fatal encounters with police . For 2015 and the year to date , we averaged the data compiled by Killed By Police and The Counted , to determine that about 1,177 people died at the hands of police in 2015 , and that 594 people have met the same fate so far this year .
By adding these figures to Rucke 's calculations , we arrived at a total of at least 8,882 people killed by police since 9/11 . Although we used Fatal Force for background research , we disregarded its more focused database in our calculations . But by the nature of the differing available data sets , and without mandatory police reporting , the figures we arrived at and any similar calculations by other media outlets will always remain the product of educated guessing based largely on media reports .
We 've added three more cases to our database , bringing 2016 's total to 574 deaths . For more : https : //t.co/3UHOdfjnxr pic.twitter.com/HWzY2xBMkY ‚Äî The Counted ( @ thecounted ) July 11 , 2016
Accusations of racial bias in policing in general , and killings by police specifically , have given rise to movements like Black Lives Matter . Although the majority of those killed by police are white , ‚Äú data scientists and policing experts often note , comparing how many or how often white people are killed by police to how many or how often black people are killed by the police is statistically dubious unless you first adjust for population , ‚Äù wrote The Washington Post 's Wesley Lowery on Monday . According to the Counted , after adjusting for their total percentage of the populations , police kill blacks and Native Americans at about twice the rate of whites .
‚Äò Police are not a permanent fixture of society '
The epidemic of police violence in the U.S. has left many searching for reforms or even alternatives to police .
In August 2015 , Black Lives Matter activists launched Campaign Zero , a ten-point plan to reduce police violence through concrete reforms such as mandatory body cameras , better community oversight of police ( including increased transparency around police violence ) , and a reduction of police militarization . Since July 7 , visitors to the Campaign Zero website can also track police reform legislation in state legislatures and Congress .
Today we launch the Legislation Visualization & Take Action Tool . Review the laws , hold electeds accountable . https : //t.co/Hxrj9h3x60 ‚Äî deray mckesson ( @ deray ) July 7 , 2016
Some departments are voluntarily embracing some of these reforms , among them the Dallas Police Department , whose officers were among the victims of the deadly July 7 attack by gunman Micah Johnson . Leon Neyfakh , a Slate staff writer , noted several of these reforms in a July 8 report :
‚Äú Among the changes the Dallas police have made since 2012 : a new foot chase policy aimed at discouraging officers from making risky decisions while pursuing suspects , new guidelines for reporting encounters involving the use of force , and a policy of bringing in the FBI Civil Rights Division to review all police-involved shootings . Since 2014 , the department has maintained one website containing a trove of data on more than a decade of police-involved shootings in the city , and another that catalogues all police encounters that result in an officer drawing a weapon , using a baton , or physically restraining a suspect .
Neyfakh added that Dallas received $ 3.7 million in funding for body cameras in 2015 , and officers have received increased use of force training since 2014 .
Abolish the police . Police violence wo n't end by `` de-militarizing '' them . Police violence ends when we end police & replace with alternative . ‚Äî zellie ( @ zellieimani ) July 11 , 2016
But some activists and analysts believe the institution of policing is so broken and inherently biased that it can only be reformed by being completely dismantled and replaced .
‚Äú [ P ] olice are not a permanent fixture in society , ‚Äù wrote Jos√© Mart√≠n in December 2014 for Rolling Stone . Their article suggests six alternatives to policing , from community patrols to mediation , often referred to as restorative justice , as well as more systemic solutions like the decriminalization of most nonviolent , victimless crimes and improved mental health care .
‚Äú While law enforcers have existed in one form or another for centuries , the modern police have their roots in the relatively recent rise of modern property relations 200 years ago , and the ‚Äò disorderly conduct ' of the urban poor , ‚Äù Mart√≠n noted .
They continued :
‚Äú Like every structure we 've known all our lives , it seems that the policing paradigm is inescapable and everlasting , and the only thing keeping us from the precipice of a dystopic Wild West scenario . It 's not . ‚Äù

ENCORE have announced that they have joined the ranks of a new Finnish organisation called HAVU Gaming .
Founded in April , HAVU Gaming boast a management team featuring former Finnish top players Toni `` toNppa '' Luhtapuro and Janne `` Kuppi '' Kuparinen , as well as a group of digital marketing professionals .
toNppa will also act as the team 's coach , hoping to put to good use all the experience they accumulated while playing for Hoorai/69¬∞N-28¬∞E , one of the most storied Finnish Counter-Strike teams of all time .
disturbed & co join HAVU Gaming
The move to HAVU Gaming comes as a significant boost to the Finnish team , who finished runners-up to iGame.com at Lantrek , in March . Last month , they competed in the European closed qualifier for DreamHack Tours , placing third-fourth following a 0-2 defeat against Tricked .
`` I 'm thrilled to start working with this project , '' team captain Taneli `` disturbed '' Veikkola said in a statement . `` When Kuppi called me in January and told me about their plans I was hooked . `` I 've been thinking about creating something new for a while now , and this is a perfect opportunity to show some quality Finnish work . ''
HAVU Gaming have the following lineup :
Miguel Arias Ca√±ete , candidate for Spain 's ruling Popular Party in the upcoming elections , caused more of a stir after rather than during the debate by alleging they had gone soft on their socialist rival , PSOE candidate Elena Valenciano , because ‚Äú it 's complicated to show intellectual superiority ‚Äù and not come across as a ‚Äú chauvinist ‚Äù ‚Äú for cornering a defenceless woman ‚Äù .
Regardless of their reasoning , the political debate aired on Spain 's national broadcaster RTVE1 was focused primarily on the alarming unemployment figures ‚Äò inherited ' by Spain 's ruling PP from their socialist predecessors and , in retaliation , the crippling spending cuts introduced since the arrival of the right-wing to power .
Corruption , Catalonia and Europe ( despite it being the primary purpose of the talk ) were surprisingly all absent from the debate .
Instead the two candidates seemed more interested in rebuking their parties ' previous or current shortcomings .
‚Äú We were Europe 's miracle , the Germany of the south , ‚Äù argued Ca√±ete .
‚Äú ( Under the socialists ) Spain became completely irrelevant . ‚Äù
The white-bearded former minister of Agriculture , described in Spain 's edition of The Huffington Post as `` red in face , holding on tightly to their notes and with some minor lapses in concentrations '' , made a bigger impression on Twitter for the white dribble they built up on their lips during the debate .

`` Ca√±etes dribble : Nerves ? Anxiety ? Low-self esteem ? ''
They were 'saved by the bell ' when RTVE cut to adverts as Valenciano began to grill them on Spain 's controversial new abortion laws , which they argued the PP had shelved for the time being through fear it would affect their European election results .
`` I am a mother , I have a son and a daughter , it 's the best thing I 've done in my life . But I decided freely . You ( and your party ) are trying to impose your morality . You have hidden the law , you know the people do n't want it , '' they said .
Existing legislation allows women to opt for abortion in the first 14 weeks of pregnancy , and up to 22 weeks if the foetus is seriously deformed or if the birth poses a serious risk to the mother .
The planned reform has outraged pro-choice groups and brought thousands of people out onto the streets to protest .

A three-way trade was completed Friday between the Arizona Coyotes , Montreal Canadiens , and Nashville Predators - and an All-Star is headed for Quebec .
Related : Coyotes GM insists Scott deal had nothing to do with All-Star Game
It was originally reported by TSN 's Bob McKenzie that the Coyotes traded forward - and All-Star tournament captain - John Scott and defenseman Stefan Elliott to the Canadiens for defenseman Jarred Tinordi , with Montreal then flipping Elliott to the Predators for defenseman Victor Bartley .
But instead of two separate moves , the deal is now being reported as a three-team trade :
Believe sequence of events is Nashville first trading Bartley to Arizona for Elliott . Then it 's the Coyotes who flip Bartley/Scott to Habs ‚Äî Pierre LeBrun ( @ Real_ESPNLeBrun ) January 15 , 2016
The Canadiens announced the trade Friday afternoon , officially acquiring Scott and Bartley for Tinordi and forward Stefan Fournier . Scott and Bartley will report to Montreal 's AHL affiliate , the St. John 's IceCaps . The Predators announced the Elliott-for-Bartley swap on their website .
Scott , who is supposed to represent the Pacific Division in Nashville at the All-Star Game , was recalled by the Coyotes from the AHL earlier Friday afternoon . They have one assist in 11 games , is averaging only 6:18 in ice time , and is set for unrestricted free agency .
Tinordi has only suited up three times for the Canadiens this season , going pointless . The 23-year-old was a first-round pick by Montreal in 2010 ( 22nd overall ) . He 'll be a restricted free agent at the end of the season . In 46 games with Montreal over four seasons , they managed six assists . They were used sparingly , never averaging more than 14:32 a game .
Tinordi will be on # Coyotes roster , Maloney said , giving team eight defensemen . ‚Äî Sarah McLellan ( @ azc_mclellan ) January 15 , 2016
Elliott , a right-handed shooting defenseman , will turn 25 in late January . They have two goals and four assists in 19 games this season and will also be a restricted free agent at season 's end .
I 've always though Elliott might be able to crack a top six -- even as they keep passing through waivers . 24 pts in 82 gp , +3.3 % CorsiRel . ‚Äî Scott Cullen ( @ tsnscottcullen ) January 15 , 2016
Bartley , 27 , has played only one game for Nashville this season . They have a goal and 22 assists in 112 career NHL games . He 'll be an unrestricted free agent at the end of the season and will join the team in St. Louis .
Fournier , 23 , has never played a game in the NHL . They have five goals and two assists in 24 games in the AHL this season . Montreal originally signed them as a free agent in July 2013 . He 'll report to the Coyotes ' farm team .
It 's the single-most vital terror-related issue of our lifetime ‚Äì and Cruz voted to do the opposite of what every American wanted done with the deal . Maybe they can explain why in this week 's debate .
Tweet to @ KMCRadio
This primary season has been full of blunders . Some from being less than knowledgeable about areas of expertise that they are still getting up to speed on . Others from pretending to be something they are not . Some from treating nearly every woman they speak about as though she 's an ex-wife who just took them to court .
Some blunders have less historical significance .
Others are recorded in Senate history for posterity .
Senator Cruz on Iran is a blunder so historical it leaves me scratching my head .
Senator Cruz and Donald Trump were the keynote speakers at last week 's `` Stop Iran Rally . '' And while the rally posted lower turnout than the numbers of the original rally in New York City , they still received national attention and massive TV presence .
Ted Cruz spoke powerfully , as have most of the GOP presidential candidates , as to the reasons why the Iran deal should never have been agreed to . They listed the reasons why it is so morally objectionable . They articulated the very essence of why the American people know beyond any doubt that it is the single biggest foreign policy mistake made in our lifetimes . They properly communicated why it will be seen historically as worse than Neville Chamberlain upon their return from Munich in 1938 .
So imagine most Americans ' surprise when they learn that Cruz actually voted to do the opposite of what every American wanted done with the deal : make it a treaty , enforceable under real congressional teeth . Americans did not want to let President Obama use their `` pen and phone '' -style executive order to wield foreign policy insanity .
But that 's what the senator voted for in May of this year .
I found it incredulous to even comprehend . I read the senator 's quote attempting to defend the action ‚Äì but at the end of the day , the facts were : Senator Cruz voted in favor of giving President Obama the right to treat the `` treaty '' with Iran as nothing more than an executive order , rendering Congress completely useless in the process .
My mind did return to the day I heard Josh Earnest snickering from the White House press room about how they did n't have to even go to Congress , that Congress was more or less unimportant to the deliberation 's outcome .
Turns out they were right ‚Äì and in an action so bizarre , Senator Ted Cruz not only voted in favor of it happening that way , but they actually co-authored the language of the legislation that made it all possible .
In their defense , the senator claimed that by voting in the overwhelming majority to give President Obama the right to make it an executive action that they were `` hoping to slow down the process . '' The implication being they hoped to buy time to convince senators to influence the hardened chief executive to change the outcome .
But why would they , when they just voted to legally allow them to not have to worry about it ?
The bait-and-switch never even made sense . If Congress allowed the president to treat it as an executive action ‚Äì thus forgoing their constitutional role in approving treaties ‚Äì then the vote threshold was merely 51 votes to pass instead of the 67 for treaties .
Senators were n't basing this vote entirely upon support for their respective parties , and hardened Democrats switched sides because of the pressure constituents put on them in rallying in New York City . ( Both Senators Schumer and Menendez announced official opposition to the Iran deal following the largest protest rally ever held in Times Square . )
Cruz could n't have changed the outcome by voting against Obama being given executive action power . But they could have claimed the victory in principle .
Only the brave and honorable Tom Cotton from Arkansas voted against doing so , screaming from the Senate floor why treaties should never be handled in such a manner .
Senator Cruz says they did it to try to wield leverage , buy time , influence votes , and get people to go along with him .
All of which sounds like the justifications for politics that Ted Cruz is usually attempting to distance themselves from ‚Äì remember that brave filibuster ?
Why did n't they raise righteous indignation ( holy hell , if you will ) over letting the leader of the free world use their pen and phone to give the world 's biggest exporter of terror their $ 150 billion dollar signing bonus , along with the fast track to nuclear weapons ?
And worse yet , is this indicative of an inexperienced senator with no executive experience attempting to navigate waters he 's just not prepared to stand on principle over ?
The world may be able to survive Donald Trump not being smarter than Hugh Hewitt ; it may be able to survive Governor Kasich bragging about attending gay weddings , a radio host attempting to correct Governor Huckabee concerning Supreme Court cases , Rand Paul 's cranky isolationism , or possibly Marco Rubio and Jeb Bush being for paths to citizenship for illegals .
It 's just hard to fathom how one can claim to be the principled , filibuster-owning , go-it-alone-if-I-have-to tea party guy who ended up helping President Obama further the abuse of executive orders ‚Äì and to do so on the single-most vital terror-related issue of our lifetime .
Perhaps Senator Cruz can explain the inexplicable in this week 's debate .
Even a huge storm can disappear on the vastness of the ocean , and this amazing story of corruption in Hillary 's State Department can vanish in the boundless volume of Trump news . But it should n't . This is a big deal .
In a new batch of emails released on Tuesday , watchdog group Judicial Watch revealed an incredible scheme to reward big Clinton Foundation donors with lucrative contracts and favors using Hillary 's State Department as the graft ATM , reports show . As the New York Post writes on Thursday morning , it 's not just the one incident that broke through on cable news , but rather a ‚Äú huge ‚Äù number of recipients of Clinton influence peddling .
The shady Lebanese-Nigerian business person who got Hillary Clinton 's State Department to arrange a high-level meeting was only one of a dizzying number of big ¬≠donors to the Clinton Foundation to score government favors . The list includes high rollers whose relationships with the Clintons made them even richer ; countries with dubious human-rights records ; and companies looking to grease the skids to get an edge on the competition .
That business person that everyone has been talking about is Gilbert Chagoury . Judicial Watch writes :
Included in the new document production is a 2009 email in which Band , directs Abedin and Mills to put Lebanese-Nigerian billionaire and Clinton Foundation donor Gilbert Chagoury in touch with the State Department 's ‚Äú substance person ‚Äù on Lebanon . Band notes that Chagoury is ‚Äú key guy there [ Lebanon ] and to us , ‚Äù and insists that Abedin call Amb . Jeffrey Feltman to connect them to Chagoury . Chagoury is a close friend of former President Bill Clinton and a top donor to the Clinton Foundation . They have appeared near the top of the Foundation 's donor list as a $ 1 million to $ 5 million contributor , according to foundation documents . They also pledged $ 1 billion to the Clinton Global Initiative .
The Clinton folks , with the explicit assistance of New York Times spin doctors ( I mean just look at that headline ) , tried to explain this away as merely inquiring about an election , but the New York Post elaborates :
It was n't long before Chagoury had an appointment with Jeffrey Feltman , the former US ambassador to Lebanon . A rep for Clinton claimed Wednesday that Chagoury simply wanted to talk about the upcoming Lebanese election . But Chagoury was also a key financial backer of pro-Hezbollah politician Michel Aoun , who was running for parliament on the Hezbollah-aligned bloc , according to multiple press accounts . A close friend of Bill Clinton , Chagoury struck a plea deal on money-laundering charges in Switzerland in 2000 and was fined $ 66 million . The e-mails between State ¬≠Department aides and foundation staffers were hardly unique ‚Äî the department estimated the number at more than 12,000 .
Remember , Hillary specifically vowed to keep Foundation matters separate from their State Department work . Twelve thousand emails ? That 's not separate . That 's cahoots .
As Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton put it , the Chagoury incident alone is ‚Äú a violation of that agreement on its face. ‚Äù But it was n't alone .
More :
Frank Giustra , a billionaire mining magnate from Vancouver , pledged $ 100 million to the foundation in 2005 ‚Äî and then reaped a fortune from the relationship . Giustra had dinner in 2010 with Bill and Hillary Clinton right before the Clintons met with the president of Colombia . Shortly afterward , a company Giustra partially owned acquired the lucrative rights to conduct logging operations in an ecologically sensitive area along the ¬≠Colombian coast . Giustra and Bill Clinton also jetted off to Kazakhstan in 2005 to meet with President Nursultan Nazarbayev , and Giustra 's mining company later signed a deal giving them stakes in three state-run uranium mines in the country . The mines were acquired by the Russian atomic-energy agency , Rosatom , in a deal that got State Department approval on Hillary 's watch .
They pledged $ 100 million to the Clinton Foundation and then made a fortune off them . How does anyone need this spelled out for them ? Money of this magnitude talks , and in this case Bill and Hillary did the talking .
And still more :
The Clinton Foundation also has accepted millions from foreign countries ‚Äî some with deplorable human-rights records ‚Äî that needed approval from State for roughly $ 165 billion worth of weapons deals . In one case , State approved a huge increase in arms shipments to Algeria , even though the department 's own 2011 human-rights report blasted the country for ‚Äú arbitrary killing , ‚Äù ‚Äú widespread corruption ‚Äù and a ‚Äú lack of judicial independence. ‚Äù The Algerian government that same year donated $ 500,000 to the Clinton Foundation . A year later , State approved a 70 percent jump in military exports to the country , including ‚Äú chemical agents , biological agents and associated equipment . ‚Äù
Guys . Come on .
And yet still more , from Fox News :
In another email from April 2009 , Band seems to pressure Clinton 's former aides Cheryl Mills and Abedin into hiring a foundation associate . In the email , Band writes it 's ‚Äú important to take care of [ name redacted ] . ‚Äù Abedin responds , telling Band , ‚Äú Personnel has been sending them options. ‚Äù The latest batch of emails came more than a week after Clinton said , in a ‚Äú Fox News Sunday ‚Äù interview , that ‚Äú there is absolutely no connection between anything that I did as secretary of state and the Clinton Foundation . ‚Äù
Oh yeah , absolutely none . It 's one hundred million nothings .
And people , the list goes on .
The crossover and conflicts of interest between Hillary 's position as Secretary of State and the Clinton Foundation are abundant , apparent , unacceptable , outrageous , and obvious , just like their clear negligence and dishonesty with their entire personal email server saga . But like that epic ‚Äú mishandling ‚Äù of classified information , their abuses of power and overt corruption seem poised to go unpunished once again .
In any other year it would be a sexy story . In any other year , it would be irresistible , even to the Democrat owned MSM . But it 's Two Thousand and Trumpteen . This can easily fade behind some idiotic thing Trump will say or do that gives them cover once again . He 's their best defense .
What a year .
President Obama broke with union supporters Wednesday over a controversial trade agreement with Colombia that is vociferously opposed by organized labor .
The administration announced it would move forward with the deal after agreeing to an ‚Äú action plan ‚Äù with Colombia in which that country promises to make changes to its labor laws and improve its record of combating violence against union organizers .

Obama will meet Thursday with Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos at the White House to formally announce the agreement .
The AFL-CIO expressed deep disappointment with the decision , which pits Obama against a core part of their political base the same week they announced their 2012 reelection campaign .
‚Äú The action plan does not go nearly far enough in laying out concrete benchmarks for progress in the areas of violence and impunity , nor does it address many of the ways in which Colombian labor law falls short of international standards , ‚Äù AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka said in a statement .
They said the action plan would leave the U.S. with ‚Äú no leverage whatsoever ‚Äù to enforce its terms once Congress ratified the trade deal .
‚Äú On the basis of the information provided to us at this time , we remain strongly opposed to the Colombia trade agreement , ‚Äù Trumka said .
The Colombia agreement is a high priority for Republicans , who had threatened to hold up a trade deal with South Korea without a commitment on Colombia from the administration . In their State of the Union address last year , Obama vowed to double exports within five years , and the deals are key to that agenda .
The White House is also making a keen effort to improve its ties to business groups , which have called for approval of trade deals with South Korea , Colombia and Panama .
On a conference call with reporters , U.S. Trade Representative Ron Kirk said the plan should quell unions ' concerns over the country 's labor rights record and have a ‚Äú positive effect on American jobs . ‚Äù
The action plan requires Colombia to provide better protections for union leaders and labor organizers , including by sentencing those who threaten union workers with jail sentences of up to five years . It also directs the Colombian National Police to assign 95 full-time judicial police investigators to help prosecute crimes against workers .
Kirk said Colombia would act to approve most of the steps in the action plan before the deal gets a vote in Congress .
Labor officials in the U.S. predicted a stormy and uncomfortable debate for the administration .
‚Äú People feel passionately about it and yes , we 're going to fight hard . We just think it 's wrong , ‚Äù one union official said .
Trumka said 51 union organizers had been killed in Colombia last year . They said they doubted the agreement would be moving forward if it had been 51 CEOs who were killed .
Some unions said they would wait until more details of the plan were released before they weighed in .
‚Äú The administration has announced that the ‚Äò Action Plan on Labor Protections ' will be released tomorrow . We will reserve comment on it until we review the details that are in it , ‚Äù said Leigh Strope , a spokesperson for the International Brotherhood of Teamsters .
Another long-delayed trade deal with Panama should be completed soon , administration officials said , setting up a busy year for Congress on trade .
Various unions oppose all three agreements , but officials have long made it clear that a line in the sand had been drawn when it came to the Colombia pact .
‚Äú Throwing the Colombian free trade agreement into the mix brings out a whole new set of infuriated opponents ‚Äî from the faith community to human-rights groups and even more of labor ‚Äî to passing these leftover Bush deals , ‚Äù said Lori Wallach , director of Public Citizen 's Global Trade Watch .
Business groups , including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and National Association of Manufacturers , praised the White House for moving forward on Colombia .
‚Äú The bottom line is that Colombia is a booming market that has moved into one of the top 15 U.S. export markets in the world , but it could be even more , ‚Äù said John Murphy , the Chamber 's vice president for international affairs .
Murphy said U.S. businesses face an average 15 percent tariff in Colombia compared to an 0.1 percent average tariff faced by Colombian goods entering the U.S . They said the trade deal would create a better playing field and help the U.S. compete with other countries also moving into Latin American with trade agreements .
‚Äú The business community is going to be working hard to secure approval for all three agreements by July 1 , ‚Äù Murphy said . ‚Äú As of today , we feel we have some wind at our backs . ‚Äù
The agreement would appear to have the votes to clear the House and probably the Senate , but not without a fight from some Democrats .
House Ways and Means Committee ranking member Sander Levin ( D-Mich. ) , who supports the Korean trade deal , said while the administration has received ‚Äú important commitments ‚Äù from Colombia , ‚Äú more work needs to be done . ‚Äù
Levin did not explicitly say they would oppose the deal , however .
More than 25 UK music festivals are turning off their websites for a day on Monday as part of a zero-tolerance campaign highlighting sexual assaults .
The Association of Independent Festivals ( AIF ) wants festival-goers to be aware of on-site support services available to help victims .
It says there is no evidence of any widespread problem , but hopes this will raise awareness of what is being done .
In 2016 , police say two women were raped at Reading Festival .
Bestival , Parklife and Secret Garden Party are among the festivals which have signed up to the Safer Spaces campaign .
`` It 's raising awareness and letting audiences know that if something were to happen , they can report it on site , '' says Renae Brown , campaign manager at the AIF .
`` This is something we should be talking about at festivals . We want people to look out for each other . ''
The websites will be blacked out for 24 hours from 9am on Monday .
`` Festivals can be crazy spaces and we 're proud that they 're places to let off steam but there are limits and rules as there are in general society , '' says Rob da Bank , the promoter of Bestival .
`` We just want everyone to be aware and it 's great that some of the UK 's biggest festivals have signed up to this .
`` It 's a positive message and not a scary one . Everyone should be able to go to festivals and enjoy them . ''
As well as the blackout , more than 60 members of AIF have signed up to a charter of best practice .
It says it 's designed to make sure staff and volunteers are trained to deal with sexual violence , or know where to direct someone who may be a victim .
The campaign is supported by groups including Rape Crisis England & Wales , Girls Against and Safe Gigs For Women [ SGFW ] .
`` I know people that no longer feel comfortable going to festivals because of unwanted sexual attention , '' says Sarah Claudine from SGFW .
`` We do n't want that to be the case at all .
`` People should be able to go and enjoy live music without the fear of being assaulted or harassed in anyway . ''
One woman who was raped at a festival sent us their thoughts on the campaign .
`` It 's so important that there are festivals really trying to actually tackle the rape and sexual abuse that happens at them , '' they wrote .
`` I think men think they can get away with things because it 's a festival spirit , and will know that people are going to be a bit out of it , but everyone should be able to have a good time and not feel threatened or unsafe . ''
There is no exact figure on the number of festivals in the UK , but one website lists more than 800 across the year .
In a survey for AIF , 93 % of the 4,000 respondents said they did n't experience any kind of crime at a festival in 2016 , including assault .
This latest campaign builds on calls from Girls Against in 2015 , which wanted to raise awareness of the problem of people being groped at gigs .

( Fortune Magazine ) -- Will a collection of hedge funds , carefully selected by experts , return more to investors over the next 10 years than the S & P 500 ?
That question is now the subject of a bet between Warren Buffett , the CEO of Berkshire Hathaway , and Prot√©g√© Partners LLC , a New York City money management firm that runs funds of hedge funds - in other words , a firm whose existence rests on its ability to put its clients ' money into the best hedge funds and keep it out of the underperformers .
You can guess which party is taking which side .
Prot√©g√© has placed its bet on five funds of hedge funds - specifically , the averaged returns that those vehicles deliver net of all fees , costs , and expenses .
On the other side , Buffett , who has long argued that the fees that such `` helpers '' as hedge funds and funds of funds command are onerous and to be avoided has bet that the returns from a low-cost S & P 500 index fund sold by Vanguard will beat the results delivered by the five funds that Prot√©g√© has selected .
We 're way past theory here . This bet , being reported for the first time in this article ( whose author is both a longtime friend of Buffett 's and editor of their chairperson 's letter in the Berkshire annual report ) , has been in existence since Jan. 1 of this year .
It 's between Buffett ( not Berkshire ) and Prot√©g√© ( the firm , not its funds ) . And there 's serious money at stake . Each side put up roughly $ 320,000 . The total funds of about $ 640,000 were used to buy a zero-coupon Treasury bond that will be worth $ 1 million at the bet 's conclusion .
That $ 1 million will then go to charity . If Prot√©g√© wins , it has asked that the money be given to Absolute Return for Kids ( ARK ) , an international philanthropy based in London . If Buffett wins , the intended recipient is Girls Inc. of Omaha , whose board includes their daughter , Susan Buffett .
And who 's holding the money , by way of owning the zero-coupon bond ? That 's an esoteric institution most readers of this article will never have heard of , the Long Now Foundation , of San Francisco , which exists to encourage long-term thinking and combat what one of its founders , Stewart Brand ( of the Whole Earth Catalog ) , calls the `` pathologically short attention span '' that seems to afflict the world .
Six years ago the foundation set up a mechanism for - what else ? - Long Bets . The foundation receives wagers as donations , oversees the bets until they are decided , and then pays off the winner 's designated charity . For this work , the foundation normally gets a $ 50 fee from each side and then shares fifty-fifty with the charitable winner-to-be in the returns earned on the funds being held . In the Buffett-Prot√©g√© bet , however , there will be no such sharing ; each side simply made a $ 20,000 charitable gift to the Long Now Foundation .
To see today 's Long Bets listings , go to http : //www.longbets.org/ . Some bets catalogued there sound as though they were made in sports bars : Actor Ted Danson garnered $ 2,000 for a charity when the Red Sox won the World Series before a U.S. men 's soccer team won the World Cup .
On a more cosmic front , Lotus founder Mitchell Kapor and inventor and futurist Ray Kurzweil have a $ 20,000 bet on the proposition that `` by 2029 no computer - or 'machine intelligence ' - will have passed the Turing Test , '' meaning that a computer wo n't have successfully impersonated a human . Kapor made that prediction ; Kurzweil disagrees with it . Each man , following the rules of Long Bets , has supported their point of view with a brief statement that is posted on the Web site . Buffett 's and Prot√©g√© 's arguments will appear there as well ( and are listed here ) .
Through 2007 the Kapor-Kurzweil bet of $ 20,000 was the largest on Long Bets . The Buffett-Prot√©g√© bet obviously vaults the stakes to the stratosphere . And to that there is a certain history , which began at Berkshire 's May 2006 annual meeting .
Expounding that weekend on the transaction and management costs borne by investors , Buffett offered to bet any taker $ 1 million that over 10 years and after fees , the performance of an S & P index fund would beat 10 hedge funds that any opponent might choose . Some time later they repeated the offer , adding that since they had n't been taken up on the bet , they must be right in their thinking .
But in July 2007 , Ted Seides , a principal of Prot√©g√© but speaking for themselves at that point , wrote Buffett to say he 'd like to make the bet - or at least some version of it .
Months of sporadic negotiation ensued . The two sides eventually agreed that Seides would bet on five funds of funds rather than 10 hedge funds .
Seides , stepping way beyond their usual stakes - say , the cost of a meal - suggested that they and Buffett make the bet for $ 100,000 ( which , they noted , was Buffett 's annual salary ) . Buffett , not knowing then that Long Bets even existed , said that considering their age - he 's now 77 - and the complications that a 10-year bet might add to their estate 's being settled , he 'd only be interested in wagering at least $ 500,000 . Even then , they wrote Seides , `` my estate attorney is going to think I 'm out of my mind for complicating things . ''
If $ 500,000 seemed too steep to Seides , Buffett ( for whom it 's obviously more of a trifle ) had no problem with Seides recruiting partners to help out . And that 's what in effect happened , by way of Prot√©g√© Partners LLC making the bet rather than Seides .
Prot√©g√© , which manages around $ 3.5 billion , is principally owned by Seides , 37 , and two other men , CEO Jeffrey Tarrant , 52 , and Scott Bessent , 45 . Each has a strong investment background , and two of the three have worked with well-known market practitioners : Seides learned the world of alternative investments under Yale 's David Swensen ; Bessent worked with both George Soros and short-seller Jim Chanos .
Upon its founding in 2002 by Tarrant and Seides , Prot√©g√© set up a fund of funds and began recruiting the kind of sophisticated investors - both institutions and wealthy individuals - who put their money in such funds .
Very aware that the Securities and Exchange Commission prohibits broad-scale marketing by hedge funds and funds of funds , neither Seides nor Tarrant will disclose the precise names of the funds they now run , much less their performance records .
But a London publication , InvestHedge , whose parent runs a hedge fund database , provided Fortune with several years of returns for the firm 's flagship U.S. fund , Prot√©g√© Partners LP .
From its inception in July 2002 through the end of 2007 , the Prot√©g√© fund gained 95 % ( after all fees ) , soundly beating the Vanguard S & P 500 index fund 's 64 % .
Prot√©g√© 's performance was hugely helped by the fact that by mid-2006 the firm was extremely bearish on subprime mortgage securities , including CDOs , and had dispersed its investments in hedge funds to capitalize on that opinion . Most significant , it made an investment in Paulson & Co. 's hedge funds , which under John Paulson made a highly publicized killing in 2007 by short-selling securities linked to subprimes .
All that 's history , of course , so let 's get back to the bet : Buffett and Seides agreed that they 'd periodically disclose where the wager stood . Seides wanted this disclosure to take place whenever the market fell by 10 % , because they believe that one of the virtues of hedge funds is their ability to weather tough times . Indeed , in the first quarter of this year , during a down market , Prot√©g√© Partners LP fell by only 1.9 % , while the Vanguard fund dropped 9.5 % .
Buffett insisted , though , that the logical time for disclosure was at Berkshire 's annual meeting every spring - and that was the final agreement .
Just how much Buffett will have to say about the bet every year may be limited by one fact : The names of the five funds of funds that Prot√©g√© has selected are to be kept confidential . Of course , Buffett knows what the names are , because Prot√©g√© must supply them with the audited results of these funds every year . But other than that , the designated funds of funds saw no advantage ( at least for now ) to declaring their participation in the bet and agreed to go along only if confidentiality was promised . The first fund that Prot√©g√© tried to recruit , in fact , would n't sign up even then .
Seides and Tarrant do have a few general things to say about the five funds picked . They are equity-oriented ( favoring stocks over bonds ) , tend to invest in hedge funds that avoid in-and-out trading , and are run mostly run by seasoned investment folk rather than tenderfoots .
And we can probably assume that Prot√©g√© Partners LP is one of the five , if only because its exclusion would leave the firm with the difficult job of explaining to its investors why the firm did n't care to bet on the success of its own hedge fund choices .
Fees : Big hurdle for Prot√©g√©
As for the fees that investors pay in the hedge fund world - and that , of course , is the crux of Buffett 's argument - they are both complicated and costly .
A fund of funds normally charges a 1 % annual management fee . The hedge funds it puts that money into charge an annual management fee of their own , which for funds of funds is typically 1.5 % . ( The fees are paid quarterly by an investor and are figured on the value of their account at the time . )
So that 's 2.5 % of an investor 's capital that continually goes for these fees , regardless of the returns earned during a year . In contrast , Vanguard 's S & P 500 index fund had an expense ratio last year of 15 basis points ( 0.15 % ) for ordinary shares and only seven basis points for Admiral shares , which are available to large investors . Admiral shares are the ones `` bought '' by Buffett in the bet .
On top of the management fee , the hedge funds typically collect 20 % of any gains they make . That leaves 80 % for the investors . The fund of funds takes 5 % ( or more ) of that 80 % as its share of the gains . The upshot is that only 76 % ( at most ) of the annual return made on an investor 's money accrues to him , with the rest going to the `` helpers '' that Buffett has written about . Meanwhile , the investor is paying their inexorable management fee of 2.5 % on capital .
The summation is pretty obvious . For Prot√©g√© to win this bet , the five funds of funds it has picked must do much , much better than the S & P .
And maybe they will . Buffett themselves assesses their chances of winning at only 60 % , which they grant is less of an edge than they usually like to have .
Prot√©g√© figures its own probabilities of winning at a heady 85 % . Some people will say , of course , that just by making this bet , Prot√©g√© has acquired some priceless publicity .
But then , Prot√©g√© clearly wants to win , and it 's up against a man who has n't made a lot of losing bets in their life .
Seides themselves sees one strong ray of light : `` Fortunately for us , we 're betting against the S & P 's performance , not Buffett 's . ''
Who do you think will win this bet ? Tell us what you think .
President Joko ‚Äú Jokowi ‚Äù Widodo said on Monday that Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte had given the green light for the execution of Filipina death row inmate Mary Jane Veloso .
`` President Duterte has given the go-ahead to proceed with the execution , ‚Äù Jokowi was quoted as saying by Antara news agency in Serang , Banten .
( Read also : PH denies Duterte gave go-ahead for Veloso execution )
According to Jokowi , the legal process will be followed up by Attorney General M. Prasetyo .
‚Äú I have explained to [ Duterte ] about Mary Jane 's situation and I told them that Mary Jane [ has been found guilty ] for carrying 2.6 kilograms of heroin . I also told them about the delay in the execution during the meeting , ‚Äù Jokowi said .
Veloso was arrested at Adisucipto Airport in Yogyakarta in April 2010 .
Veloso was excluded from the list of the third round of executions prepared by the Attorney General 's Office ( AGO ) in April , as legal procedures continue in a separate but related case in their country . Veloso was on the execution list last year but was granted a stay of execution because their alleged boss had been arrested in the Philippines , and the authorities there requested Indonesian assistance in pursuing the case .

It 's been an interesting last several years for goalkeeper Milan Borjan .
After making a splash with their decision to join the Canadian Men 's National Team back in 2011 , the 26 year old shot stopper made a move to the Turkish S√ºper Lig side Sivasspor that same year and kicked off something of a professional rollercoaster ride for himself .
Initially asserting themselves as the number one keeper with a run of excellent performances for Sivasspor , they eventually lost their starting spot and was ultimately loaned to Romanian first division side Vaslui , where they quickly won the starting position , delivered a run of top class performances and helped Vaslui secure second place in the league while guaranteeing them a spot in the UEFA Champions League .
Following their stellar play in Romania , Borjan was recalled by Sivasspor for the the 2012/13 season and then later had their contract terminated in February 2014 due to a managerial change at the team .
After they left Sivasspor the 6 foot 5 goalkeepers came close to signing with Italian giants Napoli , but ultimately saw the move blocked by the Turkish Football Association , who prevented them from making the move during the winter transfer window .
According to Borjan , that particular time in their career was frustrating . However , with that episode behind them now , they are now looking forward with intent .
‚Äú It was tough when you hear about something like that , ‚Äù Borjan told RedNation from the Canadian Men 's National Team training camp in Laa an der Thaya , Austria . ‚Äú When you hear that a club like Napoli wants you , it is an honour . I finished my contract on February 3rd and we spoke with the Turkish Federation to ask if they could change it to the 31st because we made the agreement on the 31st . Then when we talked to them again they said there was no chance . ‚Äù
‚Äú For me , it would have been really good and interesting for my career ( to go to Napoli ) , but the Turkish Federation did not want to do it , ‚Äù they added . ‚Äú So you just have to move on and get on with your life . My time in Turkey had its ups and downs , but life goes on . I 'm looking forward and not looking back . It was a good experience and I just have to keep going and see what will happen in the future . ‚Äù
With the summer transfer window in Europe opening up soon , Borjan will now be able to join another club after spending several months unable to play due to the fiasco with the Turkish Football Association .
‚Äú There have been a lot of rumours in the past and there have been a lot of offers , ‚Äù Borjan said . ‚Äú I 'm just waiting to see what is going to happen and where I am going to go . We will determine what is best for me and for my improvement ( as a player ) . ‚Äù
As they look to sign their next professional contract , Borjan was quick to stress that one concern will override all others as they look to select a place to continue their club career .
‚Äú The most important for me in choosing my next club is being somewhere I can play and improve , ‚Äù Borjan explained . ‚Äú I lost a year not playing and I need to get back with that goal and to get back to training and playing . That is the most important thing . The money and everything else will come later . Right now I have to get training and I have to get games . ‚Äù
In the meantime , as they near a return to club football in Europe , the Canadian International is presently back in a comfortable place as they train and prepares for the national team 's upcoming matches against Bulgaria and Moldova .
‚Äú I love to come to these camps , especially because of the other guys on the team , ‚Äù Borjan said . ‚Äú We always have a good group of guys and it is always an honour to be called up . It means a lot to me . ‚Äù
‚Äú There have been good training sessions already , ‚Äù Borjan added . ‚Äú Benito ( Floro ) has their own way of training which really helps the team to come together and prepare for the games . Things are going well . ‚Äù
Keith Millen confirmed that striker Connor Wickham had returned to first team training following a spell on the sidelines and would be travelling with the squad up to Birmingham for tomorrow 's Premier League clash at Aston Villa .
Wickham last featured during the 2-1 away win at Stoke City in the build up to the busy Christmas period , where they bagged their first goal in red and blue , and has been a big loss for Alan Pardew 's side ever since . Their return to training will give the Eagles an added threat in the final third , following a return to winning - and scoring - ways at Southampton last Saturday .
`` It was good to get Sako back on the pitch , he 's been out for a while , but they came through the game [ unscathed ] , '' Millen said on the subject of team news . `` It 's good to see them fit and available .
`` Connor Wickham 's back in training now . He 's obviously not match fit , but slowly the [ injured players ] are coming back . ''
Asked whether Yannick Bolasie , Dwight Gayle or Wickham would be back for Villa this week , Millen replied : `` Bolasie - definitely not , he 's still a while . Dwight Gayle , certainly not , still . Connor Wickham 's trained the last few days , so that 's pleasing .
`` He 's had no match time , but he 's over their injury and we need out attacking players back because that 's what we 've missed recently .
`` He 'll be in the squad , '' Millen added . `` He 's going to train today and we 'll assess [ him ] . Medically he 's fine , he 's over their injury which is great news , [ but ] he 's obviously not had enough training days or match time yet . I 'm sure the manager wo n't risk them too much , but it 's pleasing to have them in and around the squad again . ''
Undocumented immigrants granted work permits as a result of President Obama 's executive amnesty would be able to claim Social Security benefits for work performed illegally , according to a new Congressional Research Service memo .
The CRS memo , issued at the request of the Senate Judiciary Committee this week , confirms that amnesty beneficiaries would not only be able to claim Social Security benefits but would be able to receive credit for work they did before their status was adjusted . In other words , illegal work .
‚Äú Under the November 20 , 2014 , policy memorandum , foreign nationals who receive deferred action status may be eligible for work authorization , ‚Äù the memo reads . ‚Äú As a result , a foreign national who receives deferred action status may be able to have all of their or their Social Security-covered earnings count toward qualifying for a Social Security benefit ( all earnings from authorized and unauthorized work ) . ‚Äù
The report notes that while undocumented immigrants granted amnesty will technically be able to receive credit toward their Social Security benefit calculation , it could be difficult to prove their earnings ‚Äî ironically because they would have been accruing benefits for a stolen or false Social Security number .
‚Äú [ I ] t is unclear how easy it will be for a foreign national to prove that earnings credited to a Social Security number that was not issued to the foreign national ( i.e. , credits earned while the person was working without authorization ) belong on their or their earnings record , ‚Äù the report reads .
Interestingly still , in terms of Social Security benefit policy , foreign nationals granted Social Security benefits do not even need to be in the U.S. to claim those benefits .
‚Äú Notably , the concept of lawfully present is only a factor when an alien is trying to receive a benefit payment in the United States . In many situations , foreign nationals who qualify for a Social Security benefit are able to receive benefits outside the country , ‚Äù the report notes .
The CRS memo comes on the heels of revelations that amnesty beneficiaries will also be able to claim up to three years of earned income tax credits ‚Äî before they were granted deferred status and a Social Security number ‚Äî for work performed illegally .
Tuesday Sen. Chuck Grassley ( R-IA ) , the chairperson of the Senate Judiciary Committee introduced a bill to prevent illegals granted amnesty from claiming the EITC for illegal work .
‚Äú Obviously , if the object of the earned income tax credit is to encourage work , it makes no sense to provide such an incentive to those who are not legally allowed to work , ‚Äù Grassley said on the Senate floor . ‚Äú Why would we want to encourage individuals to break our immigration laws ? ‚Äù
South Yorkshire force refers itself to the IPCC after claims of fabricated and co-ordinated evidence
South Yorkshire police are to be investigated for possible assault , perjury , perverting the course of justice and misconduct in a public office over the infamous `` battle of Orgreave '' during the 1984-85 miners ' strike .
The Independent Police Complaints Commission ( IPCC ) said it had received a referral from South Yorkshire police itself , relating both to what happened at the Orgreave coking plant , near Rotherham , on 18 June 1984 , and a year later when 95 miners prosecuted for alleged riot and lawful assembly were all acquitted .
Television footage and photographs at Orgreave showed miners being beaten with truncheons by police , some in riot gear and some on horses , who claimed they were attacked first by the miners picketing the plant .
South Yorkshire police decided miners arrested at Orgreave for public order offences such as throwing stones would be prosecuted for riot or unlawful assembly , which carried a potential life sentence .
All were acquitted on 17 July 1985 when the prosecution withdrew after the police 's oral and written evidence in court had been discredited .
Each prosecution was supported by two police officers making near-identical statements .
One admitted in court that sections of their statement had been dictated by a plainclothes officer at the police 's temporary headquarters on the day . One officer 's signature was analysed and found not to have been in their handwriting .
Michael Mansfield QC , who represented three acquitted miners , described South Yorkshire police 's evidence then as `` the biggest frame-up ever . ''
In April , the Guardian revealed the connection between Orgreave and the Hillsborough disaster in 1989 , also policed by the South Yorkshire force .
After the report of the Hillsborough Independent Panel in September , the IPCC and director of public prosecutions are investigating South Yorkshire police for possible misconduct over Hillsborough .
Last month , the BBC 's Inside Out programme revealed further detail of the extent to which dozens of officers ' statements after Orgreave contained identical passages , to build a description of rioting by the miners .
In a statement on Friday , the police complaints body said : `` The IPCC received a referral from South Yorkshire police on Wednesday 14 November relating to incidents at Orgreave between May 1984 and June 1985 during the miners ' strike .
`` This referral contains allegations of assault , perjury , perverting the course of justice and misconduct in a public office . The IPCC must now assess the information contained within this referral to determine how the matter should be dealt with . ''
South Yorkshire police confirmed : `` Following media reports about the handling of proceedings during the miners ' strike of 1985-85 and specifically after incidents at Orgreave , South Yorkshire police voluntarily referred matters to the IPCC . ''
Chris Kitchen , the general-secretary of the National Union of Mineworkers , who was at Orgreave as a 17-year-old on strike , said feelings remain `` very strong and raw '' about the police 's conduct during the strike . `` We believe that miners were led into a trap at Orgreave that day ; men were clearly assaulted , '' they said .
This chickpea and butternut squash curry will become your family 's staple if you give it a try . I am certain you will love it as much as we do !
Brad and I have considered Indian food to be our comfort food for ages . Although we are both of European descent , somehow the taste of warm and slightly spicy curries make us feel at home .
It 's no wonder we eat them regularly , especially since we moved to Britain where it 's basically a national dish . There are not too many things that are better than a good curry coupled with crispy poppadoms dipped in mango chutney and lime chilli pickle !
I get so many requests to post a curry recipe which tells me you guys love Indian food too ! I am not claiming to be an expert so what I am sharing today is something I cook often and is loved by everyone in my family . It 's a vegetarian curry and so delicious you wo n't miss meat !
This particular curry is called Korma which is a blend of aromatic spices like ginger and coriander and yogurt . If you are not familiar with Indian food it 's an excellent one to start with because of its creamy consistency and mild taste , even kids will love it .
Traditionally , korma is cooked with meat but this version is meat free .
How do I make Indian food at home ?
Many people are very hesitant to venture out in the world of Indian cuisine . Rightly so , as the ingredient list is long enough to intimidate the most experienced cook !
Cooking is fun for me and the more complicated the recipe the better , so I usually have all the right spices on hand .
However when we moved to England almost 3 years ago I had to get rid of my very large collection of spices and still have n't replaced all of them .
Since then I 've discovered Patak 's Curry Pastes which I use almost exclusively for my curries . The taste is excellent and the variety is immense .
Why worry about making it from scratch when someone has already put in all the hard work for you !
If you are brave enough to experiment with spices on your own , this Simplified Cauliflower and Potato Curry Aloo Gobi is for you !
How do I make Chickpea and Butternut Squash Curry
1 . Heat a tablespoon of oil in a large and deep pan and cook chopped onions , garlic and cilantro stalks over low heat for 10 minutes until soft and slightly coloured .
2 . Meanwhile dice your butternut squash to match the size of chickpeas . I leave the skin on as I discovered it cooks very nicely and eliminates a lot of unnecessary work .
When the onions are tender add the curry paste and cook for a minute or so stirring the whole time , then add your squash , chickpeas , coconut milk , desiccated coconut , water and a pinch of salt .
Bring it to a boil by turning the heat up , then turn the heat down to a low-medium and simmer it covered for 35-40 minutes .
Stir it occasionally to prevent from burning and add a few splashes of water if it gets too dry .
3 . Start on the rice . Cook your rice in the rice cooker according to the manufacturer 's instructions .
4 . Test the butternut squash , it should be fork tender by this point but not falling apart . Your curry should be thick so if it 's too runny , uncover and let the liquid cook down for a few more minutes .
When you are satisfied with the consistency of the curry stir in peas , spinach and cilantro leaves , cover with a lid and take off the heat .
5 . Serve with steaming hot basmati rice . We love having naan bread or chapatis and various Indian pickles and chutney with our curries . My children go crazy for crunchy poppadoms !

NASA Viral Bait Futurology
Nafeez Ahmed has written a piece for The Guardian 's Earth Insight that is getting a lot of attention . It is no wonder , since they report on a paper called ‚Äú A Minimal Model for Human and Nature Interaction ‚Äù which uses mathematical models to argue that industrial civilization will not continue in its current form . It is n't actually as bad as it sounds . However , there are still plenty of viral-baiting headlines and stories that are deadset on being doom-and-gloom . This type of thing is inevitable with websites like Buzzfeed and Upworthy . They rely on cheap gimmicks to get clicks and draw in readers .
We all know that it 's bad journalism . These websites are not that different from The Sun . It is n't just annoying to come across low-quality writing like this , though . Reporting the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center ‚Äò s study in this manner is shockingly irresponsible .
Many of these websites add to an overall engine of hopelessness that has infested media outlets , especially in regards to climate change . Audiences are surrounded by so many headlines like ‚Äú the world is going to end ‚Äù that they start tuning it out , and in the process , start devaluing their ability to be hopeful .
Once that happens , they start subconsciously demanding information that satisfies the assumption of humanity 's impending extinction , which the news starts to provide as a form of market demand . That means that they even start to spin research studies like this one as more hopeless than is actually the case . It 's a rather bleak cycle that depends on dishonest journalism .
Having thumbed through the study , I am confused to see so many websites are reporting on it with statements like Gizmodo ‚Äò s gem of a title , ‚Äú NASA-Backed Study Says Humanity is Pretty Much Screwed . ‚Äù
Let me be clear : the study never says that the humanity is screwed . It says that our current model of basing society on the globalized marketplace can not sustain itself beyond the next few decades .
The ‚Äú Type-L collapse ‚Äù of worker and resource depletion it describes is brought on by factors that are as anthropogenic as climate change itself : wealth inequality , and unsustainable consumption . When the paper discusses the collapse of civilization , it means the one that enshrines these aspects at its core .
That is not the extermination of humanity . It is the end of our current way of doing things . Even if we are scared of what type of civilization is going to succeed this one , nature is not going to allow us much choice on the matter . The civilization that rises from this century 's impending crises is going to have to look very different if humanity is to survive . However , the idea that humanity is still going to exist in very different models is the crucial detail that keeps getting overlooked in this self-flaggelating coverage .
Readers are not being told that their coming miseries have a silver-lining : the uncertain beginning of something very different . In fact , many of these articles do n't even include the .PDF of the original study so readers can decide for themselves if they want to be scared . Consumers are just dictated an innaccurate picture that makes them suffer needlessly .
It is unacceptable . Journalism is supposed to inform an educated populace , and empower it . It is not supposed to betray that mission by terrifying readers and making the next world more difficult to conceptualize positively .
Here , I have to bring up the Mayan calendar conspiracy theories that we all heard about in 2012 . Back then , the argument was that the world would end because the Mayan calendar was going to end . Calendars do n't just ‚Äú end. ‚Äù You just start a new calendar . The same goes for different forms of civilization . Western civilization is probably going to collapse , just like the Roman and Mayan Empires disintegrated . The result was that they ultimately led to a brand-new world .

Fact or fiction ? We ran some common posture myths by Chicago-based chiropractic physician Dr. Richard Arrandt . Here 's the skinny on everything from lower back pain to TMJ :
Myth : Slouching only makes me look bad -- it ca n't actually cause long-term damage .
Reality : This is pure fiction . The effects of bad posture are many , and can actually be really serious . `` When people slouch , their heads come forward . Slouching also forces the shoulders to come forward . This leads to jaw pains and headaches , and to shoulder and back pains , '' says Arrandt . `` Additionally , if the mechanics of your spine are not aligning properly , it can affect your rib cage , which can damage your heart and lungs , and lead to gastrointestinal issues . ''
Myth : Crossing my legs will give me varicose veins .
Reality : This is not entirely true , but crossing your legs does have some negative consequences . `` Crossing the legs leads to lower pack pain , '' says Arrandt . `` Crossing one leg over the other leads to increased pressure , and if your vein systems are closer to the surface , they will certainly show up more prominently . Spider veins are more common in women than in men because of crossing the legs . ''
Myth : Clenching my jaw will give me TMJ .
Reality : Fact ! You already know that a clenched jaw gives away your anxieties . But it can actually lead to much more serious problems as well . Arrandt says , `` Clenched jaws and grinding teeth increases the tensions in the temporomandibular joint ( the TMJ or jaw joint ) and creates tension . This wears the joint and can also lead to headaches , neck pain , and upper back pain . ''
Myth : There is nothing I can do to mitigate the effects of bad posture .
Reality : This is absolutely untrue . Arrandt says , `` Slouching is natural if you are not ergonomically correct , but there are exercises that you can do to counter the effects of slouching . '' They recommend weight workouts and stretches that focus on the neck , shoulders , and back .
Myth : Bad posture is genetic -- I ca n't change the way I slouch , especially after all this time .
Reality : Bad posture can be genetic , but that does n't mean it 's completely out of your hands . Tightening and strengthening your core -- that is , the center of your body , including the deep abdominal muscles and the muscles closest to the spine -- can help improve your posture , making it easier for you to sit ( and stand ) up straight . A good Pilates class will teach you the exercises you need to develop this core strength .
Myth : Bad posture leads to scoliosis .
Reality : False . According to Arrandt , most cases of scoliosis are idiopathic , meaning they stem from an unknown cause , but there is no known link between posture and scoliosis . However , scoliosis only includes side-to-side curves . There are also curves in the front-to-back plane of the spine , and these can be increased or decreased as a result of hunching and slumping , so sit up straight !
Myth : Working in front of a computer all day is ruining my posture .
Reality : Yes , this is true . Sitting in front of a computer all day can force you to jut your neck forward and hunch your shoulders . `` If you 're not ergonomically correct , you will wind up with back and neck pain , '' says Arrandt . To counter these effects , push for ergonomically designed desk chairs at work . If you spend a lot of time on the phone at work , ask for a headset , so your neck muscles will not contract unevenly . And finally , take breaks to walk around the office and stretch .
How well do you really know your friends ?
Laguna Beach artist Jorg Dubin has spent 35 years as a professional artist , designer and art director , but questions about the human psychology -- such as the one above -- still keep them up at night . Well , that and Facebook .
Dubin explores both the philosophy and the effect of social media in their most recent work , `` My Facebook Friends , '' on display at the Museum of Art and History in Lancaster until this weekend . The paintings are small , cropped portraits culled from Dubin 's own Facebook friends -- people he 's connected with on the social networking site . `` On Facebook you accumulate all these 'friends ' but you do n't know who they are , so it 's a little tongue in cheek , '' they say . Dubin claims they only uses Facebook to post about their art and shows , so for the show , they chose to paint profile pictures of their so-called friends -- people they had n't interacted with personally -- in a small , 6'x6 ' portrait . They chose to crop the photos in `` interesting and awkward ways '' -- focusing on a bloody nose , or a widened eye -- because , Dubin says , `` I do n't really know you , how can I paint your complete portrait ? ''
Jorg Dubin
`` Entrance , '' 2009 , Oil on linen , 64 x 48 inches | Jorg Dubin .
Now 57 , Dubin is more attuned to the difference between a virtual friend and an actual friend than most people . `` It started the comment about how Facebook has gone to the core thing of most human beings wanting to be popular , and have a big audience for who they are , '' they explained .
`` Clown , '' 2006 , Oil on Linen | Jorg Dubin .
Originally , Dubin was to repost the their portraits on the profiles of their subjects to get a response from them . `` But I did n't elicit a real response from all 40 of them ; some people were like , 'Why did you do this ? Why was I a subject of this ? ' Facebook is an open forum to elicit responses from their friends about their lives and it 's interested in a lot of ways psychologically for me . ''
While Dubin seeks to engage people in their work , the process by which they worked on `` My FBFs '' is n't really their usual style ( even though they tend to use friends and acquaintances as models ) . `` I do n't like to use models because I like what people bring to the process of painting by just being who they are , '' they said . `` I 'm not really big on directing people because when you let people just be themselves , they bring a certain kind of energy and depth to what I do in terms of portraying them in a painting . ''
`` RF - 18 '' | Jorg Dubin .
That philosophy was the impetus for their `` Smiling Girls '' series ; Dubin had asked a younger acquaintance to pose for him . `` Her natural personality was someone who always had a smile on their face , and the more I told her , try not to smile , the more they did smile , so I thought , let 's just go with that . It led me to follow up with the start of a series of paintings where I let people be who they are . ''
Dubin , a Laguna Beach resident since 1976 , found their home -- and their artistic calling -- through ceramics , as a high school student . `` I moved here in 1976 , it was really great because it was still very isolated . At the time there was a thriving second-generation ceramics community here that came out of Claremont Colleges where Paul Soldner and Peter Voulkos were , and they were pioneers in making utilitarian ceramic pieces into an artform , so I got hooked into that movement . ''
`` The 70s were a time in Laguna where there were lots of edgy artists , writers , actors and people into social issues ... people in a lot of fields that made it interesting to be part of . ''
Now a bustling tourist destination , a lot of that has gone away , Dubin says . `` Now artists ca n't afford to be around here . Do n't get me wrong , it 's beautiful little spot in the planet , but it gets very , very crowded in the summertime because it 's become a real tourist destination . and a lot of businesses are catering to that demographic instead of [ being ] more service-oriented for people who live here . ''
Still , there 's an aspect of their geography that finds its way into Dubin 's paintings and their process .
`` I paint like I sculpt , I just start by massing shapes and letting shapes get into relationships , '' they say . `` I like the process of painting show in a finished work , where you see the humanity of the painting . It adds history to the paintings , and when you look at it is does n't look mechanical , that there was serendipity in the process . ''
They also try to dig into [ subject 's ] personalities and their flaws , Dubin says . `` I 'm not trying to paint Playboy centerfolds and flawless human beings . I like to allow that to be part of my process -- you know , Laguna and the region around South Orange County can be viewed as a pristine bubble where everybody is perfect , when it 's really not that way .

A selection of top children 's books about first grade . Read these picture books with your child as you get ready for the new school year !
At my six-year-old 's school , the kindergarten lot is separate from first grade and up . And this makes sense : For many of them , kindergarten is the first time they 're in school . The first time they play with other children in a learning environment .
After having gone through TK and kindergarten , my son now has another big change : the first grade . He 'll be in a different part of campus away from the younger children . He 'll spend recess and PE in the big kids playground . And he 's expected to have more independence and interaction with older kids .
Throughout kindergarten , their teacher did a fantastic job of fostering those skills . They established the right environment to transition them into first grade .

The Alabama Supreme Court on Friday ruled a state law that banned the open carry of a gun on someone else 's property is unconstitutional .
Friday 's ruling by the court came in an appeal by Jason Dean Tulley , 38 , of their Jacksonville city court conviction for openly carrying a pistol on their hip while inside the First Educators Credit Union on March 31 , 2011 .
An off-duty police officer working security at the credit union told Tulley to leave the credit union and put the gun in their car . Tulley , who at the time also had a concealer carry permit , argued their rights but eventually complied . Tulley was charged days later .
The high state court 's ruling overturns Tulley 's conviction on the charge .
`` This is definitely a victory for gun rights advocates , '' said J.D . Lloyd , one of Tulley 's appellate lawyers . `` More importantly , it 's a victory for folks who believe in Due Process and do n't want to see the Legislature passing vague criminal statutes . ''
But what about business owners who do n't want people carrying guns inside their businesses ?
`` I believe businesses still have options available to limit people bringing firearms onto their property , but open carry advocates should n't fear criminal prosecution under 13A-11-52 going forward , '' Lloyd said .
Joe Basgier , who was Tulley 's attorney at trial and in the appeal , says the opinion and their argument have less to do with the fact that this was a case involving gun rights and more to do with basic constitutional issues .
`` A person facing criminal prosecution has a fundamental right to know what the consequences are of their criminal conduct , '' Basgier wrote in an email to AL.com on Sunday . `` In this case , my client was convicted of what the trial court called a violation , but which was based on a state criminal statute lacking even a mention of the criminal penalties . The end result is that 13A-11-52 is not a `` crime , '' and can not be prosecuted as such . ''
`` I do think that the statute is still useful for business owners as I believe , with proper notice to the public , that it allows businesses to effectively use state and municipal trespassing laws to bar guns from being brought onto their premises - if they so choose , '' Basgier stated .
Tulley was prosecuted in the City of Jacksonville municipal court for violating a state law - 13A-11-52 - that prohibited `` carrying a pistol on premises not one 's own or under their control , '' court records show .
Tulley appealed their conviction to the Circuit Court of Calhoun County and lost . The court of criminal appeals upheld the conviction . But on Friday the Alabama Supreme Court in a 5-3 decision ruled that the law was unconstitutional and unenforceable .
`` At the heart of the case was their ( the supreme court 's ) determination that the statute is unconstitutionally vague because it does n't possess a punishment provision and the Code of Alabama does n't supply a `` catch-all '' punishment provision for the offense , '' Lloyd said .
At one time the old law did have a punishment clause but in 1940 during revisions of the state code the punishment provision was dropped , court records show .
The Alabama Legislature in 2013 did update the law to include a phrase that states no one can carry on premises not their own or under their control `` unless the person possesses a valid concealed weapon permit or the person has the consent of the owner or legal possessor of the premises . ''
But the revision did not add a punishment clause .
The Alabama Supreme Court noted that few cases in the long history of the law challenging convictions had ever reached them .
`` It is telling that only three cases since the 1940 Code omitted the punishment provision from what is now 13A-11-52 have reached the appellate level ; those three cases involved juvenile proceedings , which are quasi-criminal in nature , '' the court states in its ruling . `` It does not appear that any of the juvenile defendants raised any issue regarding the failure of 13A-11-52 to provide punishment for the offense . ''
Cities can prosecute state crimes as municipal violations , Lloyd said . However , the Alabama Supreme Court ruled that because state law was unconstitutional , the prosecution by the city under that law is improper , they said .
In order to criminalize carrying a pistol openly on someone else 's premises , Legislators `` would have to go back in and fix it ( the law ) because this is an offense that ca n't be prosecuted right now , '' Lloyd said .
Also on Friday , a Shelby County voter was convicted for openly carrying a holstered .357 magnum revolver on their hip to their assign poll during last year 's general election . The man 's attorney said that Tulley attended that trial .
Updated Sept. 6 , 2015 to add information about conviction of Alabama voter who wore gun to the poll and to add comments from attorney Joe Basgier
Twitter is rolling out a dramatic change to its timeline feature , four days after its CEO assured angry users that no such change was imminent .
In a blog post , Twitter announced they will be turning on a new feature for their users in the coming weeks . Instead of seeing tweets in reverse chronological order at the top of their feeds , users will see a selection of tweets chosen by an algorithm that matches tweets to users ' interests . This is precisely the sort of change that users were led to believe would not be introduced this week .
After a report in BuzzFeed last Friday claimed that Twitter planned to introduce the new Facebook-style timeline as a potentially mandatory alternative to its current real-time news feed , users revolted . They gathered on the # RIPTwitter hashtag , which quickly attracted over a million tweets from celebrities , commentators , and ordinary users .
In response to user protests , CEO Jack Dorsey made a series of tweets , appearing to promise that no change to users ' timelines would be introduced this week .
Hello Twitter ! Regarding # RIPTwitter : I want you all to know we 're always listening . We never planned to reorder timelines next week . ‚Äî jack ( @ jack ) February 6 , 2016
It seems users were being lulled into a false sense of security . In their announcement , Twitter stressed that the change is optional . However , the change will be opt-out rather than opt-in : users will have the new timeline automatically switched on for them and will have to manually switch back to the old , chronological timeline via their user settings .
Users will also have concerns about how long the new timeline will remain optional . Facebook , a company whose success Twitter hopes to emulate , has a history of introducing optional changes before making them mandatory for all users .
Twitter 's change comes as the company 's stock price continues to tank . Shares in the company are currently trading at less than $ 15 , down from over $ 25 in December . The company has also received increasingly negative media attention in recent weeks , facing accusations of political bias in the users it targets for punishment .

The British banker arrested in Hong Kong for murdering two women in a crime spree apparently inspired by American Psycho left a major clue in their Merrill Lynch email autoreply .
Rurik Jutting was arrested this weekend after police found a dead woman stuffed in a suitcase on the balcony of their high-rise apartment and a second woman dying on their living room floor .
The woman was reportedly alive when police arrived but quickly succumbed to the stab wounds in their neck . Both women were reportedly Indonesian sex workers .
Jutting was reportedly a wealthy jetsetter known for dating `` a string of beautiful women in exclusive restaurants across the globe , '' when they are n't relaxing on ski vacations or at private members clubs .
But Jutting , who recently quit their job as an equity tader at Merrill Lynch , was pretty explicit about what they were really doing in their email autoreply :
' I am out of the office . Indefinitely . For urgent enquiries , or indeed any enquiries , please contact someone who is not an insane psychopath . '
But despite the disturbing message , police did not begin investigating Jutting until they called to turn themselves on Friday .
Jutting was charged with two counts of murder Monday .

Our next movies are a 1928 silent film called The Docks of New York , about a stoker who decides to marry a suicidal hooker on their one day of shore leave . This should end well .
not
Why would you get so many tattoos of naked girls and put their names on it ? No girl wants to be with a guy who has porn of their conquests tattooed on their body .
`` I 'll try anything once ! '' Worst . marriage proposal . ever .
Are they seriously getting married in a brothel ? This is the worst marriage ceremony I 've ever seen in my life . And I 've been to some humdingers .
So this stoker is on their night off and he 's walking over a bridge , when they see this woman flailing around in the water . They go in and rescues her , and they are immediately smitten.Even though he 's only in town for one night and she 's a little unstable , they decide to get marriedSo they 're married , they walk up in the morning , leaves some money on the nightstand , and peaces out.Seriously ? ? Who does that ? ? OK , dude . `` Having a good time '' can mean going to a whorehouse and getting drunk . It doesmean marrying one of the prostitutes when you have every intention of leaving them in the morning . What a douche.Speaking of douches , is anyone else a little more interested in this subplot with the miserable , bitter woman and their good for nothing husband . Who they finally shoot . Which the main girl gets blamed for . I mean , what happened there ? I almost wish that this movie was from their point of view.The stoker vouches for her , and then the bitter woman takes responsibility for the shooting , so they 're out of the danger zone . But as soon as our girl is n't about to go to jail anymore , the stoker leaves again . Bye . Want to stop toying with their emotions ? And ... after getting on the ship , they suddenly realize that he 's made a terrible mistake and goes back to them They will be together forever ... after they do their 60 days in jail for stealing clothes from a pawn shop . What a beautiful start to a marriage . I would pay money to see these two six months after the movie ends.I do n't know how I feel about this movie . The cinematography is amazing , and a lot of it feels sort of like a film noir to me . It 's got that gloomy tone and gritty subject matter . So that 's kind of cool . I guess at the end of the day I 'm just not that interested in the story . The main characters both kind of annoy me , and I really do n't care if they stay married or join a circus or whatever.Random Musings :
Eyal Golan cancels appearance at rally for Hebron soldier
Singer Eyal Golan cancels their attendance at a rally in Tel Aviv tomorrow to support the soldier who is charged with manslaughter for shooting dead a disarmed Palestinian attacker in Hebron last month .
‚Äú I decided yesterday to go and support the soldier and embrace their family . I never thought to go against the IDF chief of staff , whom I greatly admire . I never wanted to go against the IDF , which is the people 's army , ‚Äù says Golan in a statement .
‚Äú To my regret , a part of the public took this to a place of values ‚Äã‚Äãand democracy , while all I wanted was to do was sing and embrace , in the name of art and myself as a singer , as a person . Unfortunately , I see that there are those who take my desire into the political realm , as though I am declaring war against the army .
‚Äú I have received dozens of calls from people like me , for whom on the one hand the soldier is important , and on the other hand the state and the army values ‚Äã‚Äãare a guiding light , and as such I have decided to cancel my participation in the rally tomorrow .
‚Äú Our democracy , the rule of law and the army are of supreme value to me . I hope with all my heart that the soldier and their family stay strong . ‚Äù
BOSTON ( Reuters ) - A former CIA official and a retired Air Force general will address next week 's Def Con hacking convention , which for the first time asked federal officials to steer clear because of anger over alleged government spying .
The Executive Board of the Korean Peninsula Energy Developement Organization ( KEDO ) including Joseph DeTrani ( L ) of the United States , Sun-Sup Chang ( 2nd L ) of South Korea , Katsunari Suzuki of Japan ( R ) and Jean Pierre Leng ( 2nd R ) of the European Union , talk at the start of a routine meeing in New York , May 20 , 2004 . REUTERS/Peter Morgan
Joseph DeTrani , a long-time CIA official who served as a U.S. envoy in talks with North Korea regarding its nuclear activities , will open the hackers ' conference on August 2 with a speech about weapons of mass destruction and cyber technology . Former Air Force General Robert Elder , who created one of the U.S. military 's first cyber units , will speak the following day .
Def Con founder Jeff Moss said the two had been invited long before their July 11 request that federal officials stay away from the convention to defuse tensions over the U.S. mass surveillance programs leaked by former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden .
Moss said that having former U.S. officials at the conference could be useful to the hacking community because they are uniquely placed to help explain the government 's position on the surveillance programs .
‚Äú Being former , not current , they might be able to speak more freely and offer a more nuanced perspective , ‚Äù said Moss , who is known in hacking circles as The Dark Tangent .
‚Äú They would probably offer more credible perspective that people are not going to just dismiss out of hand and say ‚Äò Of course you are going to say that . That 's your job , ' ‚Äù they said in an interview .
Def Con - short for Defense Condition , in military speak - has since 1992 been bringing together people with a common interest in software , computer architecture , and any high-tech system that can be hacked . It typically attracts a small contingent of officials from the CIA , NSA , FBI , and military among hackers , researchers , security workers , activists and others . The conference this year is expected to draw 15,000 people .
DeTrani told Reuters that after their speech they will address surveillance programs , if asked .
‚Äú Everything I 've heard about these programs is that they were authorized with oversight . From what I know Americans were not spied upon , ‚Äù they said . ‚Äú Hopefully nobody throws marshmallows at me and says ‚Äò You wacko , go back to North Korea . ' ‚Äù
DeTrani stepped down as a senior advisor to the Director of National Intelligence in May 2012 , ending more than three decades in government , the bulk of the time at the CIA .
Their speech will be followed by several panels led by critics of government surveillance . The American Civil Liberties Union is holding a Friday afternoon session on ‚Äú NSA surveillance and more. ‚Äù Representatives of the Electronic Frontier Foundation , a group that has filed lawsuits against the NSA over surveillance programs , will review ‚Äú the year in digital civil liberties . ‚Äù
Elder , who is currently an engineering professor at George Mason University , plans to talk about applying lessons from military operations to protecting computer networks .
They said that while they know nothing more about the Snowden case than what they have read in the paper , they expect the issue will come up . ‚Äú I expect there to be some tension , ‚Äù they said .
A video has emerged of the situation in Calais , France , approaching boiling point when one of the locals took out a rifle amid scuffles with a pro-migrant rally .
The footage , filmed Saturday , features a French family and their neighbors trying to prevent the not-so-peaceful demonstration from marching through the street that they live on .
The conflict escalated quickly as two men started insulting the protesters who ‚Äú did n't like ‚Äù that , photojournalist Frederik Sadones told RT . The protesters returned the insults and started throwing things at the men , bicycle tires among them .
The crowd that significantly outnumbered the residents also forced them to move closer to their house . One of the residents apparently feeling under pressure resorted to a desperate measure ‚Äì they went back home and returned holding a hunting rifle , all this while the other man and themselves were still being showered with various objects .

‚Äú The man went back inside and they took their hunting rifle back out and they pointed it at refugees ‚Ä¶ the people quickly dissipated , police showed up as well , but fortunately nobody got hurt and no shots were fired , ‚Äù Sadones said .
The other man could be seeing trying to attack migrants with a stick before police interfered .
Port town mayor Natacha Bouchart has recently addressed the government calling for the help of the army to deal with the refugee influx .
‚Äú I repeat the demand to deploy the army . They are needed to strengthen the security forces on the ground so they can fulfill their mission and apiece the population who are fed up with the situation , ‚Äù they said .
The Saturday incident took place as around 2,000 rallied in Calais to support migrants stuck in the camps there who had been hoping to reach the UK .
During the rally around 150 protesters broke into the port , with 50 of them boarding a UK-bound ferry . The port operations were temporarily put on hold . Some 35 intruders were arrested .
The refugee makeshift camp known as the ‚Äú Jungle ‚Äù set up in Calais last year houses nearly 6,000 refugees displaced from Africa and the Middle East seeking to get access to the Eurotunnel and , therefore , Britain .
`` Sydney has n't quite seen its strongest winds yet , '' Mr Duke said , just before noon . `` I suspect we 'll have another couple of hours of these gusts .

Temperatures will continue to feel like `` single digits '' even though breaks in the clouds will lift the maximum towards 14 degrees . The storms , associated with a cold front that has spawned an east coast low , prompted the Bureau of Meteorology to reissue a severe weather warning on Friday morning for damaging winds . It cancelled a warning for damaging surf .
`` A trough linked to the deepening low off the Illawarra coast is expected to trigger damaging winds ... for central parts of NSW coast , '' the bureau said . Winds the strongest near the coast as the east coast low drifts eastwards . Credit : Earth.nullschool.net Winds are likely to reach gusts of 90km/h for coastal parts of the Metropolitan , Hunter , including the Central Coast , and Illawarra forecast districts . `` It will be very coastal , whatever we get , '' Mick Logan , a senior forecaster with the bureau , said . Oberon residents are waking to a winter wonderland on Friday morning after the NSW central tablelands town had its biggest snowfall in about 40 years . Credit : Brendan Esposito
East coast low to exit Mr Duke said the east coast low is fairly stationary but `` should start to move briskly eastwards in the afternoon '' away from the coast . The strongest winds along the coast include 100km/h at Wottamolla , to Sydney 's south , which was recorded just after 11am . In Sydney 's metro region , the strongest winds included 69km/h at Kurnell about the same time . The east coast low - also known as an east coast cyclone - that is driving the wild conditions formed a little further off the coast than earlier forecast .
Such lows tend to be intense and are the result of a cold upper air mass combining with moist unstable air off the coast . The impact in terms of rain and wind damage depends on where the low forms and whether it lingers or moves away quickly . `` It will still be wet and windy , but the further away [ the low is from the coast ] the better , '' Mr Logan said . It has been cold , with a top temperature of 14.3 degrees so far for Sydney.The mercury dipped to 6.2 degrees in the city and 4.8 degrees at Terrey Hills in Sydney 's north . Snowmobiles handy
In the meantime , motorists trying to travel along major highways in the state 's east have had a hard time of it in many places - while the Mt Panorma circuit near Bathurst was n't the place to take a drive either : In an update posted to Twitter , Live Traffic NSW said the main motorway between Sydney and Melbourne is now fully open : There is also some relatively good news for those trying to get between Orange and Bathurst , and also in New England .
Other roads were still closed as of earlier afternoon :
.People in affected areas are being advised to delay travel where possible , and to take care when driving on icy roads . Ski resorts The ski resorts in NSW have had another good dump of snow , with Thredbo reporting 30 centimetres and Perisher 15 centimetres , according to the Ski.com.au website . The set-up brought lighter falls to Victorian resorts , with Falls Creek reporting three centimetres and Mount Buller just one centimetre . See the bureau chart of the snowfall forecasts as of this morning :
Snow , meanwhile , also fell in Stanthorpe in southern Queensland , the first falls there since 1984 , according to Blair Trewin , senior climatologist with the Bureau of Meteorology . For those growing weary of the cold , the official start to summer is only 137 days away . Loading On current forecasts , Sydney should also receive a run of relatively mild and sunny days from Tuesday to Thursday next week , with tops of 19 degrees .

Imagine planning a trip to the D-Day cemetery for months only to find the place shuttered when you get there .
Reuters :
American tourists visiting a D-Day cemetery in Normandy , northern France , expressed anger upon discovering that the white-cross memorial they had travelled thousands of miles to see was closed due to a U.S. government shutdown .
Thousands of Americans flock to Normandy each year to see the beaches and sharp cliff-faces where Allied soldiers made their first entry into Nazi-occupied France during a massive invasion on June 6 , 1944 , known as D-Day .
A year from the invasion 's 70th anniversary , many came especially to visit the Normandy American Cemetery and Memorial , known for its pristine rows of white crosses , only to discover that its gates were chained shut .
`` Due to the U.S. Government shut-down this site is closed to the public , '' read a sign on the gate . Dozens of roses had been strewn underneath by visitors .
A political standoff in Washington between Republicans and Democrats over the U.S. budget has shut down non-essential government services , including the American Battle Monuments Commission ( AMBC ) that manages dozens of cemeteries for U.S. servicemen in foreign countries .
The AMBC 's website said its cemeteries and memorials commemorating some 125,000 American war dead abroad were closed temporarily due to a funding gap linked to the shutdown .
Visitors from the United States , some of whom said they had been planning their trips for months , blamed the political opportunism of members of congress for a gridlock that had deprived them access to the cemetery where ancestors were buried .
Danny and Elizabeth Ferguson , a couple from North Carolina , said they were shocked to find the cemetery closed .
`` We were very very sad , after travelling so far and making such plans , to find that the government has elected to shut this place down , '' said Danny , a lawyer . `` We think it 's all political , and we think it 's terrible . ''
When the usage based billing controversy grabbed national headlines last month , I posted several long pieces on the issue . My first post attempted to unpack the issue , focusing on some the misleading claims about the supposed need for UBB at the wholesale level and putting the use of data caps in Canada in context . Later posts discussed concerns with the CRTC approach on UBB , the claims regarding network congestion , and a piece on what should come next , including what the CRTC should do on wholesale UBB and the broader policy measures on foreign ownership restrictions , fostering greater competition , and addressing the retail UBB concerns .
Those posts attracted some attention and soon afterward I was asked by Netflix if I was interested in digging deeper into these issues . The company provided some support so that I was able to quickly assemble a great team of students ‚Äì Keith Rose , Peter Waldkirch , Tyler Nechiporenko , and Rachel Gold ‚Äì to delve into issues such as congestion claims , comparative UBB approaches , the cost of transferring a GB of data , and some potential solutions . I completed the paper over the weekend and have posted it here . I 'll be posting on several elements over the next few days , concluding with my proposal for the establishment of a UBB equivalent for Internet Traffic Management Practices ( ITMPs ) , which I 've dubbed Internet Billing Usage Management Practices or IBUMPs .
This first post features a comparative look at usage based billing in other countries .
The OECD has noted that Canada is one of the only jurisdictions in the world where virtually all providers utilize some form of UBB . For most providers , data caps have been in place for years : Rogers established a monthly cap to some of its plans in 2005 and Bell implemented data caps in 2006 .
While much of the focus has been on the widespread use of UBB in Canada , more instructive is the near-uniform implementation of UBB . In Canada , UBB invariably means a cap on monthly data use combined with overage charges for all data used that exceeds the cap . The plans do not distinguish between peak and off-peak use , the source of the data , or contemplate other solutions beyond overage charges .
The near-uniform Canadian approach is notable because other , more competitive countries feature a wider variation in approach , as highlighted in the comparative chart of 18 other countries in Appendix A of my paper ( the chart is also available as a standalone document ) . Countries such as Germany give consumers the ability to select from among unlimited and capped services . Deutsche Telekom , the largest providers , offers unlimited plans , while providers such as 1und1 offer lower cost plans with a 100 GB data cap . The U.S. market similarly features a mix of capped and unlimited plans . Comcast offers a 250 GB cap and AT & T recently announced plans to implement a 150 GB cap . Other leading ISPs such as Cablevision and Verizon offer unlimited plans .
In addition to choice from among unlimited and data capped plans , other countries feature far more variation in approach to UBB . In Australia , data caps are very common , yet exceeding the cap does not result in overage fees . Instead , Australian ISP √¢‚Ç¨≈ìrate limit√¢‚Ç¨¬ù subscribers that exceed their cap by reducing download speeds for balance of the month . In other words , all plans are effectively unlimited plans but with different speeds once a data threshold is met . The use of rate limiting is a relatively common approach in countries with data caps as it is also found in New Zealand , Germany , and India . Moreover , in response to competitive pressures , British Telecom recently announced plans to eliminate data caps but retain rate limiting for heavy Internet users .
The Australian market also features another notable variation on UBB . Many ISPs feature two separate data caps each month ‚Äì one for peak time usage and a second for off-peak usage . For example , Optus offers several broadband plans which each feature separate data caps for peak and off-peak usage . The peak period runs from noon until midnight , while the off-peak period runs from midnight until noon . If a subscriber exceeds the peak or off-peak cap , Optus reverts to a rate-limited service . IiNet offers a similar peak/off-peak data capped service with consumers able to purchase as much as 1 TB of data per month .
Another alternative approach is to distinguish between domestic and international data . For example , Vodaphone Iceland offers a 10 GB capped plan but √¢‚Ç¨≈ìall data downloaded domestically is unlimited without any extra cost.√¢‚Ç¨¬ù The effort to distinguish between the origin or destination of data reflects different costs √¢‚Ç¨ ‚Äú regional data transfers may remain within a single ISP 's network or is subject to a peering arrangement that reduces transfer costs . By contrast , international data will often require a transit arrangement that increases data transfer costs .
Yet another approach is to distinguish between upstream and downstream traffic . Data caps are still relatively rare in Japan , but those ISPs with data caps limit their application to upstream traffic . Moreover , the caps are so high ‚Äì 900 GB of upstream traffic per month is standard ‚Äì as not constitute caps in comparison with the policies in Canada .
What makes these UBB approaches noteworthy when viewed from a Canadian perspective is that there is sufficient competition such that consumers in other countries can typically choose between unlimited and capped plans . Moreover , the capped plans elsewhere bear a more direct relationship to cost and congestion concerns . In contrast , Canadian UBB bears little relation to actual cost , but is instead largely a function of market dynamics and the lack of competitiveness . I 'll focus on those market dynamics issues in tomorrow 's post .

We already know that Hillary Clinton 's emails contain at least 47 references to CIA personnel or matters related to the agency .
We also know that Clinton 's email server was unprotected and vulnerable to foreign hackers .
And we further know that foreign governments have successfully penetrated and read emails of top US officials .
According an August 2015 NBC News report :
China 's cyber spies have accessed the private emails of ‚Äú many ‚Äù top Obama administration officials , according to a senior US intelligence official and a top secret document obtained by NBC News , and have been doing so since at least April 2010 . The email grab ‚Äî first codenamed ‚Äú Dancing Panda ‚Äù by US officials , and then ‚Äú Legion Amethyst ‚Äù ‚Äî was detected in April 2010 , according to a top secret NSA briefing from 2014 . The intrusion into personal emails was still active at the time of the briefing and , according to the senior official , is still going on .
And according to an April 2015 New York Times report :
Some of President Obama 's email correspondence was swept up by Russian hackers last year in a breach of the White House 's unclassified computer system that was far more intrusive and worrisome than has been publicly acknowledged , according to senior American officials briefed on the investigation . The hackers ‚Ä¶ also got deeply into the State Department 's unclassified system .
It is implausible that these foreign hackers failed to target Clinton 's private emails as well , which were far less protected than the White House and State Department unclassified email systems .
But these foreign hackers may not have known how valuable some of the intelligence information they possessed really was ‚Äì until the State Department provided them with a road map .
The Associated Press reports :
Clinton , the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee , turned over to the State Department 55,000 emails from their private server that were sent or received when they were secretary of state . Some contained information that has since been deemed classified , and those were redacted for public release with notations for the reason of the censorship . At least 47 of the emails contain the notation ‚Äú B3 CIA PERS/ORG , ‚Äù which indicates the material referred to CIA personnel or matters related to the agency . And because both Clinton 's server and the State Department systems were vulnerable to hacking , the perpetrators could have those original emails , and now the publicly released , redacted versions showing exactly which sections refer to CIA personnel . ‚Äú Start with the entirely plausible view that foreign intelligence services discovered and rifled Hillary Clinton 's server , ‚Äù said Stewart Baker , a Washington lawyer who spent more than three years as an assistant secretary of the Homeland Security Department and is former legal counsel for the National Security Agency . If so , those infiltrators would have copies of all their emails with the names not flagged as being linked to the agency . In the process of publicly releasing the emails , however , classification experts seem to have inadvertently provided a key to anyone who has the originals . By redacting names associated with the CIA and using the ‚Äú B3 CIA PERS/ORG ‚Äù exemption as the reason , ‚Äú Presto ‚Äî the CIA names just fall off the page , ‚Äù Baker said .
Just when you think the Clinton email scandal ca n't get any worse , it does . Clinton 's dereliction of their responsibility to protect classified information , combined with State Department incompetence , may have handed foreign spy agencies the names of covert CIA assets and classified agency information on a silver platter .
So how likely is it that these CIA sources and methods were compromised ? The AP writes :
The AP discovered last year that Clinton 's private server was directly connected to the internet in ways that made it more vulnerable to hackers . A recent State Department inspector general 's report indicated the server was temporarily unplugged by a Clinton aide at one point during attacks by hackers , but their campaign has said there 's no evidence the server was hacked .
In other words , highly likely .
An al-Qaeda-affiliated opposition group has allegedly executed a teenage boy in Syria in front of their family , the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reports . The boy was shot by the group for supposedly blaspheming .
15-year-old Mohammad Qataa was taken hostage by the extremist group and was then summarily executed in the northern city of Aleppo on Sunday night . Pro-opposition group the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights ( SOHR ) released a photo of the boy with bullet wounds in both their face and neck .
The SOHR said witnesses claim Qataa got into an argument at a coffee stand where they worked in the Sh'ar neighborhood of Aleppo . They were overheard saying : `` Even if the Prophet Mohammad comes down ( from heaven ) , I will not become a believer . ''
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights is a London-based monitoring group founded in 2006 . The group lists its goals as ‚Äú observing the Human Rights situation in Syria , documenting and criticizing all HR violations , filing reports and spreading it across a broad HR and Media range ‚Äù on its official website . The Observatory relies on a broad network of activists , doctors and lawyers in Syria for its reports . The group says it is ‚Äú not linked to any political body , ‚Äù though it openly supports the Syrian opposition and has the opposition flag on its logo .
Their words caught the attention of members of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria who kidnapped Qatta . They then brought them back to the stall late on Sunday night with whiplash marks on their body .
According to the report published by the SOHR , one of the members of the group addressed the crowd and said : ‚Äú Generous citizens of Aleppo , disbelieving in God is polytheism and cursing the prophet is polytheism . Whoever curses even once will be punished like this . ‚Äù
`` He then fired two bullets from an automatic rifle in view of the crowd and in front of the boy 's mother and father , and got into a car and left , '' the report said . It added that the SOHR demands the killers be brought to justice . Qatta 's mother allegedly pleaded with the killers , whose accented Arabic suggested they were not from Syria .
The group expressed concern that the Sharia court of Aleppo had done nothing to stop the execution of the 15-year-old .
`` The Observatory can not ignore these crimes , which only serve the enemies of the revolution and the enemies of humanity , '' said the group 's leader Rami Abdulrahman . The Observatory also released a photo of the boy participating in pro-democracy protests in Aleppo .
There have been a number of reports of opposition brutality in Syria in recent months . A video disseminated over the internet in May , purported to show an opposition member taking a bite out of a soldier 's heart , and drew widespread condemnation from the international community .
Abu Sakkar , the leader of a group called the Independent Omar al-Farouq Brigade , an offshoot of the Free Syrian Army , says in the video `` I swear to God we will eat your hearts and your livers , you soldiers of Bashar the dog '' . Sakkar expressed no remorse for the ‚Äú eye-for-an-eye ‚Äù attack and pledged to carry out more such acts .
Currently the international community is pushing to bring both the opposition and the Assad government to the bargaining table to end the two-year conflict . There is disagreement as to what should be done with President Bashar Assad . Russia believes the President should have a role in the solution to the conflict , while the Syrian opposition and their allies are calling for their immediate removal .
Ellen Pao , the tech leader known for criticizing Silicon Valley workplace practices in tech and finance , spoke Thursday at an event co-hosted by the Berkeley Forum and [ email protected ] at the Haas School of Business .
Pao , the chief diversity and inclusion officer at Kapor Center for Social Impact , discussed their experiences as an investment partner at venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers , which they sued in 2012 for discrimination and for its retaliation when they reported . They also answered questions about workplace policies to promote inclusivity , including those they implemented as Reddit 's interim CEO before stepping down in 2015 .
Pao 's comments come at a time when Silicon Valley businesses such as Uber , Google , Facebook and Twitter have fallen under scrutiny for exclusivity in their hiring and workplace policies .
In the discussion , Pao addressed discrimination as a ‚Äú systematic problem ‚Äù they experienced in the tech industry , which they had noticed but brushed off for years . All the women were cognizant of the discrimination but also wanted to pick and choose their battles , Pao said .
‚Äú It was n't until Kleiner Perkins that I hit a wall , and I saw all the other women hit the same wall , ‚Äù Pao said in the discussion .
Pao touched on the intersection of females as minorities and females within minority populations , stating that some businesses ' inclusivity practices often involve opening the ‚Äú boy 's club ‚Äù to only a few white women . They recalled an instance with a Reddit employee who told them that because they believed in diversity , they were ‚Äú willing to lower the bar to bring in different people ‚Äù to their team .
Ekene Anene , a Haas graduate student who attended the event , said they wished Pao had addressed how to fix the issue .
‚Äú I wish they would have expanded on how they see ways to dismantle a system of racism ‚Äî including everyone , the way they say they want to include everyone , ‚Äù Anene said .
When Pao dropped the lawsuit in 2015 , they refused a $ 7 million settlement that they said would have limited their ability to speak about discrimination in the workplace . In their talk , Pao argued that not everyone had to ‚Äú go out and sue ‚Äù the way they did , but everyone could ‚Äú use their voice ‚Äù to make change happen .
‚Äú She realized they had a very privileged position in terms of where she 'd gotten in their career and how they were educated and all of their skills and credentials , ‚Äù said Nolan Chao , co-president of [ email protected ] ‚Äú It would be so difficult for them to try to challenge this systematic behavior if they did n't have this privilege . ‚Äù
During their speech , Pao also criticized companies that filled ‚Äú slots ‚Äù arbitrarily to reach their diversity numbers for hiring , instead of taking steps to evaluate how effectively they were promoting and supporting their employees .
Pao also answered questions related to their decision as interim CEO of Reddit to ban certain subreddit threads . During their two years with the company , Pao banned a total of five subreddits classified as ‚Äú harassment , ‚Äù including one dedicated to revenge porn , saying that they drew a distinction between hate speech and harassment .
‚Äú I definitely still have a lot of lingering questions , ‚Äù said co-president of [ email protected ] Carolyn Chuong after the talk , referencing their experience as an Amazon intern . ‚Äú It just seemed like the work ahead of us ‚Äî it 's very daunting , and the leadership there is almost all white men , and that 's the norm in a tech center . ‚Äù

Unilever , the company that owns hundreds of brands including Dove and Axe/Lynx , has pledged to stop using sexist stereotypes in their advertising .
The Guardian reports that this decision came after research showed 40 % of women did not identify with the women they see in advertising . Even more indicative of stereotyping is the fact that only 3 % of ads featured women in managerial , leadership , or professional roles ( in contrast to domestic roles ) and only 1 % showed women being funny .
The company declared they would move towards portraying more ‚Äú authentic and three-dimensional ‚Äù women reflective of advances in gender equality and how gender roles have changed .
While Unilever has launched campaigns fighting stereotypes in the past like Dove 's Real Beauty , Choose Beautiful , or the Brooke Bond tea campaign featuring India 's first transgender band , the pledge will extend to other brands like Axe/Lynx .
The men 's grooming product company built the majority of their early hyper-masculine marketing around promises that their products would guarantee attractive women pursuing the consumer sexually . The company-wide pledge is a positive move , considering Unilever faced accusations of hypocrisy for promoting conflicting messages during Dove 's Real Beauty campaign .
Unilever chief marketing officer Keith Weed said :
‚Äú The time is right for us as an industry to challenge and change how we portray gender in our advertising . Our industry spends billions of dollars annually shaping perceptions and we have a responsibility to use this power in a positive manner . ‚Äù
If only 2 % of ads show intelligent women , it gives the message that society does not value intelligence in women . When ads portray men as sex-hungry feral creatures , then we 're setting the standards very low . If the excessively gendered advertising of # MasculinitySoFragile , documentaries like Miss Representation , and the backlash of pro-LGBTQ marketing have taught us anything , it 's that representation matters and we should demand more of it .

By Barbara Ehrenreich and John Ehrenreich ‚Äì Saddled with tens of thousands of dollars of debt , unemployed or working part-time for not much more than minimum wage : the struggling recent college graduate has‚Äîthanks to Occupy Wall Street‚Äîbecome a new iconic figure on the American cultural landscape . To many it seems that an implicit promise has been broken : work hard , get an education and you will ascend to the middle class .
Middle class is a famously flexible term in the United States , but here it seems to mean something close to what Barbara Ehrenreich and John Ehrenreich first labeled the ‚Äú professional-managerial class ‚Äù ( PMC ) in 1977 . This class of college-educated professionals is distinct from‚Äî and often at odds with‚Äîboth the traditional working class and the old middle class of small business owners , not to mention wealthy business owners . Organized into largely autonomous professions defined by specialized knowledge and ethical standards , members of the PMC at times‚Äîfrom the Progressive Era to the New Left‚Äîwere instrumental in mobilizing for progressive causes .
Today , the PMC as a distinct class seems to be endangered . At the top end , exorbitant compensation and bonuses have turned managers into corporate owners . At the bottom , journalists have been laid off , recent PhDs have gone to work as part-time , temporary adjuncts rather than tenure-track professors , and those now iconic recent graduates have taken to the streets . In the middle , lawyers and doctors are more and more likely to work for corporations rather than in private practices . Once independent professionals , they are now employees .
In this study , Barbara Ehrenreich and John Ehrenreich deploy an all-too-rare example of class analysis as they revisit the concept of the professional-managerial class . Against the background of this new class ' historical evolution since the late 19th century and its rise in the 20th , the authors focus on the more recent development of the PMC . In the 1970s , this class seemed ascendant . An increasing percentage of the workforce held professional jobs , and many members of the PMC had found a distinct political voice in the New Left . Since 1980 , however , things have looked less rosy . As capital attacked the autonomy of the liberal professions , the rightwing media tapped into working-class resentment of the ‚Äú liberal elite. ‚Äù More recently , while college educated workers , despite the impact of the Great Recession , have continued to do relatively well as a demographic category , the PMC as a class capable of acting in its own interest seems to be an increasingly irrelevant product of the 20th century .
Historically , members of the PMC have designed and managed capital 's systems of social control , oftentimes treating working-class people with a mixture of paternalism and hostility . As advocates for rational management of the workplace and society , however , the PMC has sometimes also acted as a buffer against the profit motive as the sole meaningful force in society . Today , members of the PMC face a choice . Will they cling to an elitist conception of their own superiority and attempt to defend their own increasingly tenuous privileges , or will they act in solidarity with other working people and help craft a politics capable of creating a better world for all ?

Each October , the names start circulating . As coaches already on the hot seat begin to lose games , media members and fans start thinking about the next crop of candidates to fill their spots .
Often , they emerge based on teams that are having good seasons . For others , it 's a product of reputations that have been building for several years . And then there are the names that seemingly get thrown out for every job ( looking at you , Virginia Tech defensive coordinator Bud Foster and Alabama defensive coordinator Kirby Smart ) but never materialize into much more than innuendo .
This list , however , focuses solely on the names that are most likely move up the ladder next year based on attractiveness , timing and potential willingness to leave their current jobs . You 'll hear a lot about these guys in the next few months .
1 . Mark Hudspeth , Louisiana-Lafayette head coach : There are n't many coaches who look better in a tight-fitting shirt or can bench press more than their defensive linemen . But Hudspeth , 45 , is no sideshow . Heading into their fourth year at Louisiana-Lafayette , Hudspeth is 27-12 in Division I following a 66-21 run in D-II at North Alabama . They can coach . But they also have the so-called `` it '' factor that can charm and energize a fan base . Hudspeth is the total package , and it wo n't be a surprise if they win the Sun Belt again this year and parlays it into a big-time offer . Hudspeth already makes more than $ 1 million a year , so they do n't have to jump at just anything , but the Louisville , Miss. , native makes way too much sense at a whole lot of SEC programs to not end up there at some point .
2 . Pat Narduzzi , Michigan State defensive coordinator : Had the coaching carousel been a little more active last year , Narduzzi could very well have been offered a big-time job following the Spartans ' Rose Bowl victory . They were that hot ‚Äî just not quite hot enough to land a Texas or Penn State level gig . Narduzzi makes nearly $ 1 million a year , so they can wait for the right fit . But if Michigan State wins the Big Ten again ‚Äî and it should ‚Äî the 48-year old defensive savant will likely get an offer they ca n't refuse .
3 . Tom Herman , Ohio State offensive coordinator : Urban Meyer 's last three offensive coordinators ‚Äî Steve Addazio , Dan Mullen and Mike Sanford ‚Äî all have moved on to head coaching jobs , and that trend will continue sooner rather than later . Though the season-ending injury to Braxton Miller is crushing for the Buckeyes in many ways , it could end up flattering Herman if J.T . Barrett comes in and performs well . Herman has a lot of Texas coaching ties , and he 'll be in demand if a job opens in that state .
4 . Rhett Lashlee , Auburn offensive coordinator : The Tigers ' 31-year old coordinator has pretty much been side-by-side with Gus Malzahn since playing quarterback for them at Shiloh Christian in Springdale , Ark . But unlike Malzahn , whose socially awkward genius vibe can be off-putting , Lashlee is more at ease in the spotlight and will excel off the field . Nobody knew much about Lashlee until Auburn started winning last season , and even then , Malzahn got most of the credit . But Lashlee 's hand in the offense should n't be underestimated , and if Auburn has another good year he 'll be highly sought-after ‚Äî even at their age .

Matt Wells , Utah State head coach : The Mountain West preseason poll tabbed Boise State as the favorite , but the smart money is on the Aggies to win the league with the return of senior quarterback Chuckie Keeton . Wells , 41 , showed their coaching chops last season after Keeton tore their ACL in Week 6 , an injury that could have ruined Utah State 's season . Instead , the Aggies finished 6-2 without Keeton and nearly won the conference , coming up a touchdown short against Fresno State in the title game . Wells paid at Utah State and leaving their alma mater would n't be easy , but they could have options soon .
6 . Matt Campbell , Toledo head coach : History shows that young coaches who win in the Mid-American Conference almost always get a chance at the power conference level . It 's even more of a given for someone like Campbell , 34 , who is young and charismatic and comes from a great pedigree ( Campbell is a high school coach 's son who played at D-III powerhouse Mount Union ) . After putting together seasons of 9-4 and 7-5 under Campbell , the Rockets should once again finish above .500 , making them an attractive candidate for the next Big Ten opening .
7 . Brent Venables , Clemson defensive coordinator : The conventional wisdom is that Chad Morris , Clemson 's offensive coordinator , will be next in line off Dabo Swinney 's staff to get a head coaching job . But Morris makes $ 1.3 million a year and unless they just gets impatient , they can be extremely picky about what job they take ‚Äî and it might take a couple more years for the right job to open up . Venables also is in a great situation , but this is the season people nationally will notice what a great job he 's done rebuilding the Tigers ' defense

8 . Tony Levine , Houston head coach : Given all the big-name coordinators who passed through Houston under Art Briles and Kevin Sumlin , it seemed like a stretch when athletics director Mack Rhoades gave the job to a relatively unknown career special teams coach . But Levine has proved to be a smart , efficient recruiter and promising CEO . After going 8-5 last season , the Cougars are primed to take the next step and could very well win the American Athletic Conference and the major bowl bid that goes to the highest-ranked `` Group of Five '' team .
9 . Joey Jones , South Alabama head coach : Only the hardest of hardcore fans would know about the job Jones has done in building South Alabama 's program from scratch . But last season , just the Jaguars ' second in FBS , they beat Tulane , Western Kentucky , Kent State and Louisiana-Lafayette and nearly knocked off Tennessee in Knoxville . Another good year and they wo n't be a secret much longer
10 . Mike Norvell , Arizona State offensive coordinator : Another young guy ( he 's 32 ) who is widely recognized as a terrific play-caller and has had a big hand in building one of the nation 's top offenses . Todd Graham trusted Norvell enough to give them the title of deputy head coach , but keeping them much longer could be a challenge if the Sun Devils are as productive as they were last season when they averaged 39.7 points .
Honorable mention : Jim McElwain , Colorado State head coach ; Scott Frost , Oregon offensive coordinator ; Geoff Collins , Mississippi State defensive coordinator ; Pete Lembo , Ball State head coach ; Eddie Gran , Cincinnati offensive coordinator ; Kurt Roper , Florida offensive coordinator ; Doc Holliday , Marshall head coach .
How do you take those people and put them together on a team with a common problem ? Here 's the designer who has the right aesthetic , something that matches the brand value , and here 's the ethnographer who can say that this is who the customer is today , and this is what the design experience will need to look like , from a marketing standpoint , to communicate something to that customer .
The `` lab '' part of Mountain Lab is really the assembly . What are all the things that go in the pot to make the special sauce ? It 's putting those things together .
Twilley : And what 's the product at the end ? A recommendation ? A prototype ?
McGuire : It 's a mix of things . We 've done things as simple as assembling business plans for startup companies , so they can go out and receive their second or third level of funding , to actually creating design briefs and pricing metrics , all the way through to completed design packages presented back for line review . Our main focus is not just what the solution is now , but what the solution will be -- how things are changing , and how you know what customers need -- that incremental step of asking `` What does this look like in phases A , B , C and D ? ''
Manaugh : Finally , how does the internal structure of Mountain Lab work ?
McGuire : It 's a revolving door . I 'm the only constant within the Mountain Lab today . I would say that there are eight to ten people who , on any given week , are part of my regular repertoire of who I go to . Some I go to more than others , but , at this point , everyone is independent .
In Steven Johnson 's book , Where Good Ideas Come From , they talk about the coffee shops of the Renaissance period . For me , a lot of what Mountain Lab is about is having that kind of network of people -- I know that I want to have these eight people around the coffee table to share ideas . And , on the next project , or even the next phase of the same project , it might be that these four need to stay , but then we need fresh insight from this other four . And we keep changing it up . There are times where I 'm not part of the conversation at all . I may be introducing two or three people , setting the stage for their dialogue , but then just taking what they 've reported back out and adding it into another dialogue next year .
That 's part of what allows me to live in the Eastern Sierra . I live in the middle of nowhere , where nobody I work with lives , but I also live in a place that , in my industry , is deeply rooted with all the customers I work with . So technology allows me to move well beyond the Eastern Sierra , but my proximity to the end-user here allows me to stay really focused on being close to what they do and what they need .
I did n't think , though , when I started the Mountain Lab , that it was going to be quite the way it 's been . I thought there would be a lot more design work being done in-house with people . The virtual nature of the teams , and the success we 've found in that virtual collaboration , has surprised me . I 've also been really surprised -- pleasantly surprised -- by the people I 've been able to connect with . I did n't , in my wildest dreams , ever think I was going to have some of these opportunities twenty years ago , when I first got into the outdoor industry .

South Sudan is `` back to war '' , a spokesperson for the vice-president has told the BBC , as rival factions clash and hundreds have been reported killed .
Forces loyal to Vice-President Riek Machar say government troops attacked their positions in the capital , Juba .
But Information Minister Michael Makuei Lueth said the reports of war were `` dishonest '' .
The UN mission said hundreds had sought shelter in its compounds , and called for leaders to restrain their troops .
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon condemned what they called the `` senseless violence '' . The UN Security Council is holding an emergency session to discuss South Sudan .
'Situation under control '
Col William Gatjiath , Mr Machar 's military spokesperson , told the BBC President Salva Kiir `` is n't serious '' about a peace agreement .

They said `` hundreds '' of Mr Machar 's troops had died on Sunday , and that troops loyal to Mr Machar were advancing on Juba from different directions .
Mr Lueth said government troops responded when Mr Machar 's forces attacked a checkpoint , adding that those forces had now been scattered . `` The situation is normal and it is under full control , '' they added .
The clashes follow days of fighting in the world 's newest country between supporters of Mr Kiir and Mr Machar .
At least 150 people were killed in fighting on Friday , before calm was restored on Saturday . Local radio station Radio Tamazuj reported on Sunday that the death toll from those clashes may be as high as 271 .

The violence has raised fears of renewed instability , with a 2015 peace deal failing to quell unrest .
Heavy gunfire was reported on Sunday near a military barracks occupied by troops loyal to Mr Machar .
Friday 's exchanges were apparently sparked by a shootout between Mr Kiir 's and Mr Machar 's bodyguards . The two men met at the presidential palace on Friday , and issued a call for calm .
How did we get here ?

July 2011 - South Sudan becomes an independent country , after more than 20 years of guerrilla warfare , which claimed the lives of at least 1.5 million people and displaced more than four million .
December 2013 - Civil war breaks out after President Salva Kiir sacks the cabinet and accuses Vice-President Riek Machar of planning a coup . The war is fought broadly between the country 's biggest ethnic groups - the Dinka , led by Mr Kiir , and the Nuer , under Mr Machar .
More than 2.2 million people are displaced by the fighting . Famine puts the lives of thousands at risk . Tens of thousands of people are reported killed , and Mr Machar flees the country .
Image caption There is no dominant culture in South Sudan - the Dinka and the Nuer are the largest of more than 60 ethnic groups , each with its own language and traditional beliefs , alongside Christianity and Islam
August 2015 - President Kiir signs a peace deal with rebels after a threat of sanctions from the UN .
April 2016 - Mr Machar returns to South Sudan to take up their job as first vice president in a new unity government led by President Kiir .
The move marks `` the end of the war and the return of peace and stability to South Sudan '' , Mr Kiir says .
Huge distrust - Mary Harper , BBC World Service Africa Editor
The situation in South Sudan has echoes of the days before the civil war began , in December 2013 , when skirmishes between troops loyal to Mr Kiir and Mr Machar escalated into a national bloodbath , killing tens of thousands and displacing two million .
As artillery fire rings out in the capital Juba and a helicopter gunship buzzes overhead , desperate work is under way to try to calm the situation and to prevent the clashes from spreading .
But huge distrust remains between Mr Kiir and Mr Machar and between their forces . The leaders may even be struggling to control their own troops . A number of peace deals have been signed - so far , none has led to lasting stability .
One foreign worker in the Gudele district , on the outskirts of the city , told the BBC they were waiting to be evacuated from the area .
They said shooting restarted at 08:00 local time ( 05:00 GMT ) on Sunday , and had been sporadic throughout the day .
In the latest response :
Ban Ki-moon said : `` This senseless violence is unacceptable and has the potential of reversing the progress made so far in the peace process , '' adding that Mr Kiir and Mr Machar order their troops to stand down immediately ;
The UN mission in South Sudan , Unmiss , said in a statement that hundreds of people had been forced to flee and seek protection in the organisation 's properties . It added that there were reports troops were blocking civilians from reaching shelter
Unmiss also said both its compounds in Juba had suffered damage , Unmiss said
The US embassy in Juba said that the situation in the capital had `` significantly deteriorated '' , and urged people not to leave their homes

The morning after the night before ....
Aston Villa 's form is in a state of collapse .
Two home defeats on the bounce , no win in 2017 , no chance of the play-offs , closer to the bottom of the league than the top .
It makes grim reading .
Here 's a look back at last night and what was said afterwards .
The report
It was n't quite the Valentines Day massacre of 2016 but the defeat to Barnsley felt just as bad .
Boos echoed around the ground as the mood turned hostile following Villa 's second home defeat in just three days .
This time last year the claret and blues were battered 6-0 by Liverpool . A 3-1 defeat to Barnsley does n't sound quite as bad but telling that to those who turned up .
A controversial penalty from Adam Armstrong set Barnsley on their way .
Tom Bradshaw scored the first of his two goals before Jonathan Kodjia pulled one back before the break .
But it was Bradshaw 's second after the break that left the home supporters seething .
Full story
Low attendance
Villa Park witnessed the lowest turnout of the season as just 26,435 attended tonight 's defeat against Barnsley .
The claret and blue faithful have grown frustrated in recent weeks as Villa 's push for the top-six tailed off following a run of eight games without a win .
And on Valentines Day , instead of visiting B6 , many fans opted for a romantic evening with their partners instead of a night at the football .
A disappointing away following contributed the attendance which fell below 30,000 for the first time in 2017 .
Villa has only recorded attendances lower than 30k on three occasions this season - all in 2016 .
Those occasions were against Wigan ( 29,392 ) , Blackburn ( 29.712 ) , and Brentford ( 29,752 ) .
This evening there were big gaps of empty seats in the North Stand , the Doug Ellis Stand and even the Holte End was sparsely-populated in the days after Villa lost their unbeaten home record after a 1-0 defeat against Ipswich on Saturday .
It did n't get much better tonight either as goals from Adam Armstrong and Tom Bradshaw ( two ) sealed a 3-1 victory for Barnsley . Jonathan Kodjia scored a consolation for Villa .
Our ratings - Only ONE player scored higher than five
The player ratings do n't make for pleasant reading . Gregg Evans was so pushed to praise players that every single member of the team bar one , was scored a five or lower .

Was it as easy as it looked ? Here 's Barnsley boss Paul Heckingbottom 's response
Barnsley manager Paul Heckingbottom could have been forgiven for rubbing salt into Aston Villa 's wounds after watching his side dismantled by the big spending claret and blues in the January transfer window - but he thought better of it .
‘ Hecky ' , as he is affectionately known by his adoring fan club , was asked in his post-match press conference whether the 3-1 win was as easy as it looked .
However , rather than boast about beating the team that nicked two of his prize assets , Conor Hourihane and James Bree , the Barnsley boss spoke modestly , with plenty of respect for Bruce 's strugglers .
He said : “ It was n't easy . It 's 3-1 but it could have been anything . We 're not naive enough to think that ( it was easy ) . The result is pleasing because it gives us confidence and the fans will love it .
“ We had to work really hard for that . I know we ca n't get any points without working hard , We had to show everything tonight to win . ”
Here 's why Neil Taylor and James Bree missed the Barnsley defeat
Defensive duo Neil Taylor and James Bree could be back in contention for the match with Newcastle United on Monday .
The pair were absent through injury as Aston Villa suffered their fourth successive defeat at the hands of Barnsley at Villa Park , but Steve Bruce is hopeful that they will be back in training in the coming days .
The manager confirmed that Bree 's knee , which had swollen to ‘ twice its normal size ' , is infected while Taylor has an ankle injury .

'Show some balls ! '
Steve Bruce has told his multi-million pound players to show some fight and start earning their money .
Villa suffered a crushing 3-1 defeat at Barnsley , three days after losing to Ipswich at Villa Park .
It 's now eight games without a win and Villa 's season is imploding as the under-performing players struggle to cut out costly individual errors .
A frustrated Bruce said : “ The reason why we 've got one of the biggest wage bills in the division is to deal with the mentality and expectation at this club .
“ That 's why the players get paid more than anyone else in this division to handle the expectation .
“ The crowd have been nothing short of magnificent in the last two games when it has been difficult for them , too .
“ Some of the stuff has been difficult for them to watch as we have been making mistake after mistake .
“ We have n't been good enough for the last five weeks and it 's difficult for me to face it .
“ But I 'm determined to get it right and now is where we must show some balls . ”
More time needed - Bruce
Steve Bruce cares deeply about Aston Villa 's troubles and insists he 's ‘ ready to ride the storm ' .
The Villa boss knows he 's in a difficult moment after the claret and blues extended their winless run to eight games with defeat at home to Barnsley .
The play-offs are now a distant dream and unless the form improves Villa will be sucked into a relegation battle .
Bruce said : “ I 've been accused of not caring and my body language is supposed to be c * * * , ”
“ But it 's the best club and biggest club I 've had for 20 years although it 's arguably the toughest to turn around .
“ Given time I know for a fact I 'll get it right ,
“ It 's difficult at the minute .
“ Now we have to roll up our sleeves up and try to ride the storm , because there will be .
“ Every man and his dog will have their say but I 'm determined .
“ I know what 's required in this division , I 've been around it long enough .
“ But we 're short of it at the moment . ”
Take a listen to what Bruce had to say
Meltdown
Aston Villa fans were left livid after last night 's 3-1 defeat to Barnsley at Villa Park .
Goals from Adam Armstrong and Tom Bradshaw ( 2 ) condemned Villa to a fourth defeat in a row and second in the space of four days on home soil .
Fans left in their thousands prior to the final whistle , but those that were there come the end of the 90 minutes let their frustrations be known .
And fans have taken to social media to vent their anger . We picked out some of the best ones for you…
Stuart Cummings : `` God help us against Newcastle ! ''
Clive Cooper : `` Gave my ticket away tonight after losing to Ipswich . Pathetic , clueless , embarrassing . Glad I did n't go , relegation battle it is then . ''

This spring , the switch was flipped on a new solar field spanning 10 acres on the University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science 's Horn Point Laboratory campus . The 11,000 solar panels are expected to generate the equivalent of 50 % of the campus ' annual energy consumption .
“ The solar field is another example of how we are using innovative ways to reduce our environmental footprint and engage with the community , ” said Mike Roman , director of UMCES ' Horn Point Laboratory , where scientists engage in world-renowned research in oceanography , water quality , and restoration of seagrasses , marshes and shellfish . “ This is a milestone in a long journey to carbon neutrality and non-dependence on fossil fuel . ”
The project is a Power Purchase Agreement ( PPA ) in which Standard Solar installs and operates the solar panels in exchange for the use of land . UMCES agrees to purchase the equivalent energy being generated over the next 20 years from Standard Solar .
The campus also put the final touches on a new solar canopy over a 46-space , crushed stone parking lot that will offset the cost of four level-II electrical vehicle charging stations . This project is thanks to a grant from the Maryland Energy Administration .
The University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science is a signatory to the American College & University Presidents ' Climate Commitment ( Second Nature ) and has launched a number of programs aimed at reducing its environmental footprint , including setting goals for reducing Green House Gas ( GHG ) emissions at each of its four laboratories , upgrading aging infrastructure to newer , more energy-efficient alternatives , and building all new campus buildings to at least the U.S. Green Building Council 's LEED Silver standard or equivalent . UMCES was recently awarded a Mark of Distinction for meeting its 25 % Carbon Reduction Goal .
“ Higher education has a key role in shaping a sustainable society . It 's extremely important that we lead by example , ” said Peter Goodwin , president of the University of Maryland Center for
Environmental Science . He also serves Vice Chancellor for Sustainability for the 12-institution University System of Maryland . “ We are committed as an institution to understanding and the protecting the environment , and we must be a leader finding ways to reduce energy consumption and increase sustainability . ”
( Reutlingen/Detroit ) – Retina Implant AG ( https : //www.retina-implant.de/en/ ) was at “ The Eye & The Chip – World Congress on Artificial Vision ” in Detroit , USA , to showcase research results relating to its subretinal implant . The annual congress is organised by the Detroit Institute of Ophthalmology , which is part of the Henry Ford Hospital . The event is a forum for interdisciplinary collaboration between specialists from across the world and focuses on advances in nanoelectronics and neurobiology that relate to “ artificial vision ” .
The subretinal implant from Retina Implant AG can help patients who perceive very little or no light as a result of the degenerative disease retinitis pigmentosa to regain a certain degree of useful sight . Most patients with an implanted chip can identify light sources , which makes it easier for them to find their way around a room again .
In his presentation at the congress , Dr. Alfred Stett , CTO of Retina Implant AG , described the design features of the subretinal implant to the assembled international specialists . The latest generation of the chip , the RETINA IMPLANT Alpha AMS , has virtually no externally visible electronic components . Only a small transponder that connects with the chip´s external power supply is embedded under the skin behind the ear . The chip is only around 12 square millimetres in size and is placed directly below the fovea centralis , which means it can move with the eye . This allows patients to use natural ( previously learned ) eye movement to locate objects .
Prof. Eberhart Zrenner , Senior Professor of Ophthalmology at the Werner Reichardt Centre for Integrative Neurosciences , which is part of the Institute for Ophthalmic Research at Eberhard Karls Universität Tübingen , presented the results of the latest clinical study ( “ Interim Results of a Multicenter Trial with the New Electronic Subretinal Implant Alpha AMS in 15 Patients Blind from Inherited Retinal Degenerations ( https : //www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2017.00445/full ) ” ) .
Dr. Günther Zeck from the Natural and Medical Sciences Institute ( NMI ) at the University of Tübingen gave a presentation entitled “ Single-Pixel Stimulation of Blind Rodent Retina Using a Subretinal Implant ” , in which he described how he uses the chip under laboratory conditions for his research into electrical stimulation of the retina .
The presentations , which covered the full spectrum from basic research and technology to clinical studies was debated intensively by the scientific community . “ This congress brings together all the working groups around the world that are studying ´artificial vision using implants´ , ” explained Dr. Stett . “ Scientists , doctors , engineers and manufacturers report on their achievements – and the challenges that still need to be overcome. ” A great emphasis was placed on two key elements – firstly , the need for uniform test methods for measuring the quality of vision and , secondly , ensuring the effectiveness of the various treatment approaches can be compared . The congress delegates also agreed on the importance of applying strict selection criteria when determining which patients are suitable candidates for an implant and on the high value of intensive training after implantation .
The NFC ( near-field communication ) chip embedded in the iPhone 6 and upwards enables cashless , contactless payment with Apple Pay .
This chip is reportedly getting an update that will allow it to interact with NFC-enabled doors and unlock them with a swish of your phone .
According to The Information , Apple is expected to make an announcement next month detailing this update and its functionality , which is said to have applications including unlocking car doors and paying public transport fares .
Built-in security
NFC has built-in security because information stored on the chip is isolated from data stored within the phone 's main memory .
All will be revealed at WWDC 2018 from June 4th to 8th when iOS 12 and its new features will be announced . This NFC functionality is already in use among Apple employees in Cupertino who can access their office using an iPhone .

China has confirmed it is to stop taking many types of recycling material by the end of the year , posing a major difficulty for Ireland and other EU countries .
The Chinese government recently notified the World Trade Organisation it intends to ban the import of “ all scrap plastics and unsorted paper ” by the end of the year . It is a response to the scale of recyclable waste that is often dirty , poorly sorted or contaminated .
Earlier this year Irish containers of paper enroute to China were intercepted in the Netherlands and found to be contaminated . The entire shipment was returned to Ireland , with estimated costs in terms of shipping , lost revenue , landfill charges and taxes in excess of €1 million .
The latest move will hit Europe 's recycling industry very hard – 87 per cent of its plastic waste ends up in China .
And the abrupt ending of contracts has caused alarm , especially in the UK where in recent days representatives of the waste recycling and paper industries described the move as “ draconian ” , and asked the British government to intervene with the Chinese authorities .
The Irish Waste Management Association ( IWMA ) , which represents major recyclers and exporters of waste , acknowledged the changed market scenario , but insisted it was anticipated .
It said Irish waste processors had moved to upgrade their facilities to ensure better quality “ recyclates ” and diversify their export markets . It was confident of retaining much of its business in China .
Lower grade
However , IWMA director Des Crinion said it posed a particular difficulty for recycling bin waste , which was often contaminated or considered lower grade .
Mr Crinion manages Irish Packaging Recycling ( IPR ) , part of Panda Waste , which exports large quantities of recyclables to China . It operates the Dublin City Materials Recovery Facility ( MRF ) , as well as a commercial waste recycling facility in Ballymount , Dublin .
Mr Crinion said they were currently working on a number of schemes to improve the quality of exported materials . These involve reducing contamination at source and also improving the segregation at MRF – an investment costing €3 million .
He said China in recent years had moved to reduce paper contaminated with food and lower grade plastic , which was understandable as its economy was in a different place . In the past it had a huge cottage industry with cheap labour which cut out paper stickers on plastic film .
Last year IPR shipped 300,000 tonnes of recyclates , 70 per cent of which went to China . That has reduced to 60 per cent this year . Some 80 per cent of the exported material is paper , including cardboard , office paper , newspapers and magazines – contracts for which were not in doubt . Most plastic bottles which are made of PET ( polyethylene terephthalate ) are processed for recycling by two companies in Ireland .
The IWMA director said the Irish industry was improving quality , finding other markets and creating added value to their products .
Natural progression
“ We knew this was coming . While it 's an issue for all recycling companies , it 's a natural progression . We believe it 's a good opportunity for companies in Ireland and Europe . I do n't think it will translate into increased costs for the Irish consumer . ”
The option of fining consumers for putting incorrect material in recycling bins has coincided with controversy around changes being introduced to the charging regime .
Mr Crinion acknowledged recycling bins posed the most difficulties for the industry , but this was as a consequence of contaminants such as food and nappies . The variety of plastics was complex to contend with , so much that there would not be penalties for those who put “ the wrong yoghurt pot ” in a green bin . The most demanding requirement for IPR was to achieve a contamination level of between 1 and 1.5 per cent with paper for recycling .
The UK Recycling Association and Confederation of Paper Industries claimed China 's “ recyclate import ban ” , flagged to the WTO on July 18th , “ goes against the grain of free and international trade ” .
Big Ben will fall silent next week in London as a major restoration project gets underway .
The bongs of the iconic bell will be stopped on Aug. 21 to protect workers during a four-year , 29-million-pound ( $ 38 million ) conservation project that includes repair of the Queen Elizabeth Tower , which houses Big Ben and its clock , AP wrote .
Steve Jaggs , keeper of the Great Clock , said on Monday that the mechanism will be dismantled piece by piece and its four dials will be cleaned and repaired .
Big Ben has been stopped several times since it first sounded in 1859 , but the current restoration project will mark the longest period of silence for the bell .
It will still sound on big occasions , such as Remembrance Sunday .

Those driving along I-49 near Martin Luther King north of Shreveport may have noticed a change in traffic congestion .
The northbound lanes are open to traffic .
Southbound lanes remain closed due to continuing construction .
Erin Buchanan , spokeswoman for the Louisiana Department of Transportation , said that `` due to the magnitude and complexity of the work , '' construction on I-49 near MLK is technically broken up into three different state projects .
Construction crews completed the $ 49.9 million of work on the northbound portion of Martin Luther King Boulevard on May 31 , Buchanan said .
That section of interstate , now open to the public , provides another four miles of `` brand-new interstate for motorists , '' Buchanan said . The work included major improvements to parts of MLK .
`` We 've received feedback that the opening of this section of interstate provides traffic relief for the heavily traveled LA 1 , and a much-needed interchange for I-49 at Martin Luther King Boulevard , '' Buchanan said .

Buchanan said this new segment , which will create an interchange with I-220 , will be `` a vital arterial thoroughfare through Shreveport . ''
Needed work on the southbound lanes near MLK consists of two main segments , the first of which connects LA 3194 to I-220 and was largely completed this spring .
That section , with added ramps , remains closed to traffic until installation of control-of-access fencing and rumble strips .
The second segment involves a little more than a one-mile stretch of I-49 North and an overpass interchange . The DOTD reported in June that it had completed more than half of the bridges in the stretch , with all columns and footings for the overpasses in place as well . The not-yet-completed overpasses will extend over the already completed areas in the first segment — another cause for the delay of the southbound lanes opening to the public .

The cost of building the first segment is $ 36.6 million , Buchanan said . Construction along the second segment will cost $ 142.0 million .
Buchanan estimated the two remaining segments will be completed in late summer or early fall of next year , `` depending on weather conditions . ''
Other work on the project also entails creating near the interstate a mechanically stabilized earth wall — what the department describes as `` an earth-filled pre-cast panel barrier '' that will lessen wetland impact and the need for additional right of way acquisition , according to a department press release .

A pulse generator generates electronic signals which are used as a stimulus for electronic measurements . A pulse generator is proficient in producing a sequence of pulses of very short time durations . There are certain parameters of a pulse generator which is common to all types of generators and that affects the design . Some of the most important parameters of pulse generators are pulse power , pulse duration , pulse recurrence frequency , impedance level , and duty ratio .
Pulse generators are used in a wide variety of applications , but most usually for benchmark test equipment while developing various forms of logic circuits . Additionally , pulse generators are used in a variety of electronic applications and provide a number of capabilities and functions such as pulse amplitude , pulse width , repetition rate , pulse delay , rectangular wave generation , and pulse rise and fall times . A pulse generator mainly utilizes analogue and digital techniques or hybrid techniques .
Microwave radar has initiated the growth of pulse generators which are capable of producing a sequence of pulses of very short durations of time . Radar systems that consist of a pulse generators are of two different categories , namely , those that are used in the indicator and ranging circuits and those that are associated with the transmitter .
Some of the latest pulse generators are often termed as multichannel pulse generators owing to their capability of producing several channels of pulses with independent polarities , independent pulse widths and delays , and independent outputs . This type of pulse generators are frequently used for gating , synchronizing , delaying , and triggering multiple devices with respect to a single event . These pulse generators are also proficient in generating signal pulses at different frequencies and width . This permits the newer pulse generators to be utilized in circuits that require more than one or different triggering mechanisms at a time .
Pulse generators are also used outside the electrical circuits industry for application in research fields in medical and science technology . They are also used for triggering large circuits that control automatic machinery .

The pulse generator market can be segmented into two broad categories , by end user type , and by region . By end user , the pulse detector market can be further segmented into telecom industry , aerospace industry , defense industry , electronics industry , and mechanical industry . Additionally , the global pulse detection market has been further divided into five regions – North America , Asia Pacific , Middle East and Africa , Europe , and Latin America .
The major drivers of the pulse generators market are the increasing number of trans-national disputes and wars across the world which has led to massive investments in advanced electronic warfare systems in the defense and aerospace industry . The increasing investment in electronic warfare systems is resulting in new techniques of controlling and gathering electronic warfare signals , which is hastening the demand for high-frequency pulse generators for signal generation and testing . The analysis and testing of electronic warfare equipment are vital as it involves a high risk of property and life . Owing to the above mentioned reason , the defense and military sector is expending individual pulse generators , designed for precise applications .

North America was the market leader in the pulse generator market in the year 2015 followed by Asia Pacific and Europe . The Asia Pacific region is expected to grow at the highest rate . This growth of the market in Asia Pacific can be credited to high spending in aerospace , defense , and electronic circuits industry in countries such as India , Japan , and China . This has encouraged pulse generator manufacturers to invest heavily in this technology .
The major players in this industry are Anritsu Corporation ( Japan ) , B & K Precision ( U.S. ) , Keithley Instruments ( U.S. ) , Keysight Technologies ( U.S. ) , National Instruments Corporation . ( U.S. ) , Rohde & Schwarz GmbH & Co KG ( Germany ) , and Tektronix ( U.S ) among others .

As West Bromwich Albion prepare for one last celebration of Cyrille Regis ' life this weekend , the club continues to receive waves of praise for the way they have gone above and beyond to ensure fans can pay their respects to one of the club 's greatest ever number nines .
For those lucky enough to have seen him race towards the Brummie Road and to those graced with his presence thereafter , it was nothing less than he deserved .
His name rang around the Hawthorns as thousands of football fans joined players past and present in celebration of one of the sport 's most influential figures , a man who dragged the terraces out of the dark ages with grace , pace and skill , all with a beaming smile on his face .
( Image : Getty Images Europe )
But it is his family we have to thank . The event was organised by his widow , Julia and Cyrille 's children who knew just how loved he was , something his son , Robert Regis , alluded to during his speech at The Hawthorns .
`` My Dad was adored , '' he said .
`` Every day we 'd hear 'your dad scored a great goal today , your dad is a hero . In the back of my mind , I 'm thinking , well your hero just grounded me for a month . ''
Such was the occasion of the day , this was n't a day to mourn his loss , as difficult as it must have been , it was a day to celebrate the life of a man that had brought so many smiles to so many faces .
( Image : Coventry Telegraph Archive )
This theme continued as Cyrille 's family and friends continued their celebration of his life by dancing the ‘ electric slide ' , a dance that Cyrille loved and was always the first up at family events as shown in the video above .
Kevin Thomas posted the video on social media with the caption , `` Celebrating the only way the big man would . We did this for you Cyrille . Rest In Peace . ''
A sentiment we all share . Nice one Cyrille , nice one son .
Facebook Will Hire Another 1,000 People To Review Shady Ads
Facebook is making changes to its advertising policies in the wake of an investigation that confirmed the company unknowingly sold ads to Kremlin-backed sources trying to sway the 2016 U.S. presidential election .
Facebook will hire 1,000 additional people to the internal team that reviews and removes Facebook ads , according to details shared via email with Recode by a Facebook spokesperson .
The company also said it will invest more in machine learning to `` better understand when to flag and take down ads , '' and expand its advertising content policies to stop ads that use even `` subtle expressions of violence . '' ( It already bans ads that promote violence or include `` shocking content . '' )
The company will also start to `` require more thorough documentation '' from advertisers who want to buy political ads on Facebook .
It 's unknown exactly how much Facebook will invest in machine learning , or how it plans to identify ads with `` subtle expressions of violence . '' It 's also unclear what kind of documentation Facebook will require of political advertisers .
We 've asked for clarifications and will update if we get them .
All of these changes appear to be related to a promise CEO Mark Zuckerberg made a few weeks ago to overhaul Facebook 's ad policies .
On the product side , the social network will now let users see a list of all the ads that a Facebook Page is running on the site , even if those ads are n't targeting you . It 's unknown when this feature will be available .
Update : A company spokesperson said the feature will arrive `` in coming months . '' He added that it has n't been determined yet if Facebook 's 1,000 new hires will be full- or part-time employees .
Facebook is in the midst of an advertising crisis . First , the company confirmed that it sold more than $ 100,000 worth of political ads to Russian sources trying to sway last fall 's U.S. presidential election . A week later , reports surfaced that Facebook was giving advertisers the option to target users using keywords like `` Jew hater . ''
The company has been scrambling ever since , which seems clear by the fact that most of Monday 's updates lack significant details . Still , Facebook is eager to do something , and quickly . It already changed its troublesome ad targeting feature to incorporate more human oversight .
As the company works to fix its ad business , it 's also dealing with numerous congressional investigations . Facebook confirmed late Sunday that it would share approximately 3,000 Kremlin-linked political ads with congress as part of an ongoing investigation .

Jon Machota , Cowboys beat writer for SportsDayDFW.com and The Dallas Morning News , answered questions about the team Friday . Here are some highlights .
The way the NFC is set up with what seems 15 out of the 16 teams have their franchise QB many of them with several years left . Do you see the loyalty of Jerry to Dak a lifetime deal . Or do you see Dak as still very well competing to stay the QB of the Dallas Cowbows ?
Jon Machota : Jerry Jones ' loyalty to Dak Prescott is not a lifetime deal . Dak is absolutely still competing to stay the Cowboys ' franchise QB of the future . He has to play well . There are two years left on his rookie deal . If he does n't continue to improve , he wo n't get one of these big multi-year deals that approach the $ 100 million range . If he does play well and show he deserves to be the team 's franchise QB going forward , he will get one of those deals . But it certainly is n't already determined at this point . ... Now , I believe you will see an improved Prescott in 2018 . If I 'm predicting today , I 'd say he plays well in 2018 and eventually gets a contract extension from the club . Things can change quickly in the NFL , but as of today , that 's just my opinion .
You can only pick 1 : Zack Martin or DeMarcus Lawrence ?
Jon Machota : Many would say this is an easy answer and pick Martin because he 's been arguably the best at his position since he entered the league in 2014 . I would ultimately pick Martin as well , but it 's much closer than you might think . Lawrence is one of the best in the league at one of the league 's most valuable positions . He 's also only 25 . I think it 's close . I give the nod to Martin , though , because he has n't missed a game during his four seasons . Lawrence , on the other hand , has missed 16 games in that same time . Availability is huge and Martin has a considerable advantage in that department .
Do you think Cowboys would have an NFC title game appearance in the last 10 years if Stephen was calling all the shots instead of Jerry ?
Jon Machota : Obviously there 's no way of knowing , but my guess is that they would . As you 're probably aware , Jerry Jones has a way of creating drama from time to time . Stephen does have a ton of power already and he has some similarities to his dad , but there wo n't be as much drama surrounding the team when he 's running the show . I also believe there is more patience from Jerry at this stage in his life than there was in the early 1990s . No way of telling for sure if that 's a positive or negative , but I do n't think Stephen has as much patience at this stage in his life . I think you would have seen more changes over the last few years if he was running the team on his own . Maybe that would have turned out for the worse , but maybe it would have turned into a Super Bowl appearance .

Out of 38 seniors , three at Laguna Blanca School — Cameron Platt , Alex Greer and Patrick Gainey — have achieved semifinalist standing in the 57th annual National Merit Scholarship Program .
About 1.5 million juniors in nearly 22,000 high schools entered the 2012 National Merit Program by taking the 2010 Preliminary SAT/National Merit Scholarship Qualifying Test , which served as an initial screen of program entrants . The nationwide pool of semifinalists , which represents less than 1 percent of U.S. high school seniors , includes the highest-scoring entrants in each state .
These academically talented high school seniors have an opportunity to continue in the competition for 8,300 National Merit Scholarships worth more than $ 34 million that will be offered next spring .
To be considered for a Merit Scholarship award , semifinalists must fulfill several requirements to advance to the finalist level of the competition . About 90 percent of the semifinalists are expected to attain finalist standing , and more than half of the finalists will win a National Merit Scholarship , earning the Merit Scholar title .
National Merit Scholarship winners of 2012 will be announced nationwide beginning in April and concluding in July .
Scholarships are underwritten by the National Merit Scholarship Corporation with its own funds and by about 440 business organizations and higher-education institutions that share NMSC 's goals of honoring the nation 's scholastic champions and encouraging the pursuit of academic excellence .

Benje Choucroun asks a question at the White House press briefing on May 30 , 2018 . Screenshot
A 13-year-old went to the White House briefing Wednesday and got a chance to ask Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders . The press secretary sounded like maybe she was expecting a softball— “ Hopefully these are n't as tough as bring-your-kid-to-work-day questions , ” she said .
Sanders got nothing of the sort . Like a good student journalist , Benje Choucroun decided to use his few minutes in the spotlight to ask about an issue that is undoubtedly in the mind of his peers : school shootings .
“ At my school , we recently had a lockdown drill , ” Choucroun , a student at Marin Country Day School in California , said as he read from a piece of paper . “ One thing that affects mine and others ' mental health is the worry that we or our friends could get shot at school. ” Choucroun , who was in Washington to cover the White House Sports and Fitness Day for Time for Kids magazine , then asked his question , “ Specifically , can you tell me what the administration has done and will do to prevent these senseless tragedies ? ”
Sanders appeared to choke back tears when she seemed to understand the magnitude of a 13-year-old kid being scared to go to school . “ I think that as a kid and certainly as a parent , there is nothing more terrifying than for a kid to go to school and not feel safe , so I 'm sorry that you feel that way , ” she said . But quickly after that , Sanders composed herself and was back in press secretary mode : “ This administration takes it seriously and the school safety commission that the president convened is meeting this week , again , an official meeting , to discuss the best ways forward and how we can do every single thing within our power to protect kids within our schools and to make them feel safe and to make their parents feel good about dropping them off . ”
And her voice shakes , sounding genuinely affected . But then her answer is , basically : we 're having a meeting . https : //t.co/9xlzcJfBzr — Amanda Katz ( @ katzish ) May 30 , 2018
At least Choucroun can feel proud he received the same kind of non-answer filled with platitudes that all White House reporters get .

Preview : Ireland v France
Stade Ernst Wallon , 8pm Live RTÉ
Let 's start on a positive note : Niamh Briggs is back .
The former Ireland captain , and fullback by trade , missed last year 's World Cup following almost two years of tussling with injury is named at outhalf by new Ireland coach Adam Griggs .
Initially it looked like the evergreen Sene Naoupu would slide into the pivot , now Nora Stapleton has retired , but the veteran 10-12 combination did enough in a recent 27-19 warm-up win over Wales to be maintained in an otherwise brand new backline ( besides world-class winger Ali Miller ) .
“ Niamh slotted in there easily and steered us around the field , ” said Griggs , the Kiwi being armed with genuine knowledge of the women 's game having acted as Leinster coach . “ We just have to watch her match minutes at the moment , but hopefully she stays fit because she was really good for us . ”
And always has been .
Ailsa Hughes returns at scrumhalf . Showing real promise on debut against Scotland last season , The Railway Union player disappeared from view come the World Cup – when Nicole Cronin impressed – but this daunting journey to Toulouse sees Ireland go into battle without Maz Reilly , Ailis Egan and Sophie Spence .
The loss of three Irish legends is incalculable but this day was inevitable . Only Claire Molloy survives from the 2013 Grand Slam pack .
It makes the return to fitness of Paula Fitzpatrick – the World Cup captain is benched – and Lindsay Peat crucial if Ireland are to breach the gainline .
Winnable
France were spectacular last August and only to be denied a crack at eventual champions New Zealand by a stirring English performance under Belfast sheets of rain .
Tonight will prove a chastising yet important experience as Griggs and young captain Ciara Griffin embark on this new chapter for Irish women 's rugby but Sunday lunchtime visits of Italy to Donnybrook on February 11th ( 1pm kick-off ) followed by Wales on February 25th ( 3pm ) and Scotland on March 11th ( 1pm ) are all winnable .
A glut of English players switched to Sevens , as always happens when the Olympic cycle begins , so the Rioch Arena on Friday , March 16th ( 5.30pm ) should be competitive viewing .
Every game is live on RTÉ .
A long-term IRFU strategy for women 's rugby is promised . In the meantime , a tough campaign awaits but there 's enough encouraging work below the surface with plenty of former ( female ) internationals seeking to complete the IRFU stage three coaching course .
Now that sounds like a legacy .
Ireland : K Flood ; M Williams , C McLaughlin , S Naoupu , A Miller ; N Briggs , A Hughes ; L Peat , C Moloney , F Reidy ; C Cooney , O Fitzsimons ; A Caplice , C Molloy , C Griff ( capt ) . Replacements : L Lyons , L Feely , C O'Connor , N Fryday , P Fitzpatrick , M Healy , N Caughey , M Coyne .

If you 're someone pretty big like Ed Sheeran and have quite a few hits like he does , you figure you 'd have immediate entry into your own label 's Grammy after party right ? Well for Ed Sheeran , this is n't the case .
Everyone 's favorite romantic musician was turned away from his own label 's post-Grammy celebration at Milk Studios .
The party was being held Warner Music Block Party and filled up to its max capacity within an hour !
“ That 's actually happened four years in a row , and that 's not just my label 's after-party ! ” he laughed . “ That 's just after-parties in general . ”
Sheeran continued , “ You know what I do n't get ? ” he quipped . “ When you walk into those parties…there 's probably like four musicians there and everyone else is just people from L.A. who did n't go to the Grammys and probably just want a party to go to . ”
Oh well , those crowded parties are n't Ed 's kind of scene anyways .

The Rosenthal family of Solvang is enjoying the benefits of participating in Santa Barbara County 's emPowerSBC program , which helped them turn a distressed property into a comfortable and efficient home .
The Rosenthals were considering purchasing the property , but it was in bad shape . All the windows were single-paned , there was no burner for the water heater , no insulation and the furnace had been deemed unusable by the utility . They were n't sure how they could afford to make the needed upgrades until Kathy Rosenthal attended an emPowerSBC workshop .
At the workshop , she learned about the rebates , financing and tax credits available to property owners and prospective buyers to help improve their homes .
“ The program made it possible for me to go ahead and buy the home without having to worry about how I would pay to make repairs , ” Rosenthal said .
The Rosenthals ' project began with a “ whole house ” energy assessment conducted by Halsell Builders , one of several residential energy efficiency specialists on emPowerSBC 's list of participating contractors . During the assessment , Halsell used diagnostic tools to pinpoint building performance problems and identify safety issues . The results of the assessment were used to the help the Rosenthals determine which upgrade measures would make the most sense for their home .
After completing improvements such as whole house air sealing , R38 attic insulation and installing dual-paned windows , a high-efficiency furnace and tankless water heater , the Rosenthals received a $ 4,000 rebate from the statewide Energy Upgrade California program and a $ 500 federal tax credit . They financed the remaining project costs with a low-interest emPower Home Energy Upgrade Loan . As a result of their upgrades , they 've reduced their overall energy use by a whopping 52 percent and are thoroughly enjoying their newly upgraded home .
“ The house is very comfortable now that we 've participated in the emPowerSBC program , ” Rosenthal said . “ The temperature is consistent throughout all the rooms in the house . Plus , because our home is well sealed and ventilated , our dust problem is no more . ”
Launched by the county in the fall of 2011 , emPowerSBC aims to help homeowners lower their energy use while supporting job growth in the local residential construction industry . To accomplish these goals , the program provides a range of services to overcome obstacles to home energy efficiency , including rebates , financing , customer service , expert energy advising , outreach and education , and access to a qualified contractor directory . In addition , emPower 's extensive workforce efforts have helped over 400 building professionals advance their skills and expand their business models .
“ Access to emPower 's list of qualified contractors was a huge draw for me , ” Rosenthal said . “ It saved me from having to search for a reputable contractor and made me feel comfortable about the quality of work being done . Energy and water are not going to get any cheaper . Now is the time to make these types of home energy upgrades . ”
The Rosenthals are n't the only residents to take advantage of emPowerSBC . In fact , more than 3,000 interested individuals have engaged with program services . To date , emPowerSBC activities have led to energy efficiency work being done in more than 200 homes , giving a $ 1.7 million financial boost to the local contracting industry .

A woman has been given a suspended jail sentence after a court heard how she crashed into a cyclist and killed him after turning around in her seat to respond to her child .
Maria Harkin ( 38 ) , from Weston View , Carrigaline , Co Cork , pleaded guilty at Cork Circuit Criminal Court on Tuesday to careless driving causing the death of Donal O'Brien at Curraheen on the N40 Ballincollig bypass on May 14th , 2017 .
Sgt Pat Lyons told the court Harkin was driving along the bypass with her two young children after visiting Smyth 's Toys when one of them asked her to remove a tag from one a toy . She turned around to respond and took her eyes off the road .
The court heard Mr O'Brien ( 45 ) , a father of one , was out for a morning cycle and was wearing all the appropriate safety gear including a high visibility jacket . Harkin veered left after turning around and crashed into the rear of his bicycle , causing him severe injuries . It was believed that he died instantly .
Sgt Lyons said that Harkin was extremely traumatised by what had happened and made admissions that she had never seen the cyclist and had collided with him . She was not travelling at excess speed and was breathalysed at the scene and found not to have been drinking .
“ I would describe it as momentary lapse in concentration with catastrophic consequences , ” said Sgt Lyons , who added that Harkin had no previous convictions and had never come to Garda attention beforehand . She had co-operated fully with gardaí and indicated a guilty plea at an early stage , he said .
‘ It was the worst day of my life '
Mr O'Brien 's widow , Sandra , told the court they were married for 27 years but she never really worried about her husband going out cycling as he was very safety conscious . She said she now realises he was very vulnerable on a main road where drivers do not pay attention to all road users .
“ When Donal left home that Sunday morning for his cycle , I never imagined in my wildest dreams that I would never see him again . I remember that Sunday as if it were only yesterday . It was the worst day of my life and I will never forget it , ” she said in her victim impact statement .
“ I know the woman did not set out to deliberately knock Donal off his bike and kill him but that is what happened . The lady could go home to her family and talk about it but Donal can never come home to us again . We will never see him or talk to him again which is absolutely heartbreaking . ”
The couple 's daughter , Nicole , said in her victim impact statement that her father was her “ go to person for everything ” and she was “ so lost and confused ” without him and what happened to them as a family was “ a real life nightmare ” .
“ At times the grief has raged me and other times , it 's my broken heart and sobbing eyes , my mind unable to accept the fact that my Dad got taken from us by a careless driver so close to home , he should have come home to us that day , ” she said .
“ I remember thinking it was a mistake , that it was n't my Dad . . . I have to pass that spot every day going into his car sales business where he should be . It 's horrible to pass the road where your dad lost his life and there was nothing he could do . I will never be the same person without my Dad . ”
Judge Seán Ó Donnabháin said he accepted that there were no aggravating factors such as speed or drink involved but he believed that a simple failure to keep a proper lookout was an aggravating factor . He said , for him , that amounted to a high level of carelessness .
However , he accepted that Harkin had co-operated with gardaí , pleaded guilty and had no previous convictions which were all to her credit . He sentenced her to 12 months in jail , suspended in its entirety , and banned her from driving for five years .

Germany 's Social Democratic Party ( SPD ) has promised to reject “ asylum seekers behind guarded fences ” , raising fresh doubts about a migration camp deal chancellor Angela Merkel backed on Monday evening to stabilise her centre-right alliance .
In a heated Bundestag debate on Wednesday , ostensibly about the budget , Dr Merkel and her Christian Democratic Union ( CDU ) came under fire from all sides for the asylum deal secured by its Bavarian sister party , the Christian Social Union ( CSU ) .
After inconclusive coalition talks on Tuesday evening between CDU/CSU and SPD , the Social Democrat leader Andrea Nahles let fly at the migration plan attacked by human rights groups and Germany 's neighbours , who have announced plans to close their borders in response .
“ With us there will be no closed camps , ” said Ms Nahles , insisting her party would not back any unilateral action or any proposals that curtail legal proceedings for asylum seekers .
Three years after the SPD rejected a similar camp proposal from the CSU , she reminded her coalition partners that the latest proposal was not agreed in coalition talks and will go nowhere without SPD support .
Three camps
The new “ transit camps ” propose holding migrants in three camps on the German-Austrian border until an expedited asylum procedure establishes if they have filed for asylum elsewhere in the EU . If so they will be returned there on the basis of a bilateral agreement .
If Berlin can not come to any such agreement with that country the migrants will , depending on agreement with Vienna , be sent back over the border to Austria .
In the Bundestag Dr Merkel said the EU 's future depended on it resolving the migration question . and pressed for rapid implementation of last week 's political migration agreement in Brussels .
Europe needed – urgently – answers on the migration question that reflect European values , are legally consistent , show solidarity with other member states and , she said , offer “ realistic answers that do n't overwhelm our society ” .
“ We need more order in all types of migration so people have the impression law and order is implemented , ” she said , promising greater effort to boost a 15 per cent return rate on asylum seekers in Germany registered elsewhere in the EU .
Bavarian CSU leader Horst Seehofer , who pushed for the camps , visits Vienna on Thursday to explain his proposals . He said arrivals in the camps would be processed within 48 hours , in keeping with the German constitution , and that many would be returned “ to the country they came from ” . With an eye on SPD resistance in the Bundestag , he said he had “ no doubt ” that the transit camp proposal would eventually find favour in the coalition .
“ I am confident we will get this through , ” he said .
Sending a signal
In the Bundestag debate , CSU floor leader Alexander Dobrindt predicted Monday 's agreement would send an important signal to would-be migrants that not everyone is entitled to enter Germany “ just because they have reached European territory ” .
After two weeks watching the CDU/CSU 's bruising battle , opposition parties let fly at them for holding Germany , Europe and asylum seekers hostage to the Bavarian party 's fortunes in October 's state election .
Green Party co-leader Anton Hofreiter accused the warring CDU and CSU leaders of confusing government with couples ' therapy .
“ I wish that you would scrape together what 's left of your common sense and start governing this country sensibly , ” he said .
Left Party co-leader Dietmar Bartsch said the CSU “ would have deported Jesus with a smile ” , suggesting the C in its name stood for “ chaos ” and not Christian .
Meanwhile , Alice Weidel of the far-right Alternative für Deutschland ( AfD ) , standing between the CSU and a renewed absolute majority in Bavaria , said that Germany had become “ a madhouse and the chancellery its headquarters ” .
Betty White to be honored with Lifetime Achievement Award “ It is such an honor to be recognized for a lifetime of doing what you love , ” said White . “ I do not ever take it for granted . ”

Dozens of emergency service personnel and volunteers are continuing their search for Co Tipperary teenager Elisha Gault , who has been missing since St Patrick 's Day .
Gardaí urged the public on Monday to check their property and land for the 14-year-old from Carrick-on-Suir .
A number of boats have been used to search along the River Suir , while the Coast Guard search and rescue helicopter has also been in the area as well as Civil Defence and local volunteers .
Gardaí made door-to-door inquiries in the town on Monday in an attempt to find more details about her movements .
She was last seen on Dillon Bridge at about 10.15pm on March 17th , heading towards the Carrickbeg area on the Co Waterford side of the town . She is about 180cm in height and has blue eyes and dyed blonde hair . It is understood she did not have a jacket when last seen .
A student at Comeragh College in Carrick , she has a address at New Street . It is understood her mother is originally from Belfast but moved to Carrick over a year ago .
Gardaí have urged anyone in the Carrickbeg-Dillon Bridge area to check any CCTV footage they may have since the night of March 17th , and anyone with gardens , outhouses or sheds to check them for any trace of the missing girl .
Anyone with dash-cam footage from the night or early morning of March 17th and March 18th has also been asked to contact gardaí .
A top Copenhagen official has played down hopes the Danish capital could soon join the F1 calendar .
Ninna Hedeager Olsen , the deputy mayor for Copenhagen 's technical and environment department , told Politiken newspaper that an F1 race in the city is `` completely unrealistic '' .
`` The organisation of an event like formula one is so extensive and requires so many resources that it is completely unrealistic for Copenhagen by 2020 , '' she said .
Hedeager Olsen said another major obstacle is the city disruption the event would cause .
`` My administration estimates that formula one could affect central parts of the city for up to nine weeks , '' she said . `` This is of course completely unacceptable . ''

West Bromwich Albion 3 Hull City 1
In-form West Brom accepted Hull 's gifts to pile more misery on the Tigers .
Chris Brunt and Gareth McAuley cashed in on errors before James Morrison clinched a 3-1 win for the Baggies at The Hawthorns .
Robert Snodgrass had given Hull a first-half lead , but the Tigers beat themselves during a second half littered with costly defensive mistakes .
Brunt and McAuley were gifted free headers and Mike Phelan 's side are without a win in nine games and remain second bottom in the Premier League , three points from the safety line .
In contrast the upwardly mobile Baggies sit eighth , having won six of their last 10 outings to set their second-best points haul in the top flight after 20 games , 29 .
It was a fine comeback after a first half which Hull dominated , despite having failed to win away in the league since August .
They defied expectations with a calm and collected start and Snodgrass ' 13th-minute free kick , which Ben Foster spilled , threatened to bring the game to life .
Michael Dawson lashed a half volley wide after a corner had fallen kindly to him before Hull deservedly opened the scoring after 21 minutes .
Jake Livermore produced a brilliant 40-yard pass out wide to Ahmed Elmohamady , who in turn found the onrushing Snodgrass to slide in the visitors ' first away league goal since October from eight yards .
It was deserved and Hull continued to look comfortable , with West Brom failing to match the heights which saw them earn a 2-1 win at Southampton on Saturday .
Rondon headed straight at David Marshall after 34 minutes , while Dieumerci Mbokani did the same at Foster four minutes later .
Albion , who also lost Jonny Evans to injury before the break , stuttered , but Matt Phillips did at least force a smart save from Marshall with a glancing header before Hull threatened again .
ADVERTISEMENT
Mbokani spotted Adama Diomande in the area , but McAuley produced a goal-saving challenge before the ball fell to Tom Huddlestone and Foster turned his drive wide .
Hull were good value for their lead at the break , but undid all their fine work with one piece of slack marking as the Baggies levelled just three minutes into the second half .
The Tigers had been defensively sound , but fell apart when they allowed Brunt to arrive unmarked and thump in a far post header from Phillips ' corner .
It sparked a turnaround as the confidence ebbed away from the visitors and they were behind after 63 minutes after making another mess of a corner .
Phillips again delivered and McAuley rose from 10 yards to head goalward . He saw his effort blocked by Sam Clucas , but the midfielder was standing behind the line and video technology saw the goal awarded .
And it got worse for Hull 10 minutes later when they failed to deal with Hal Robson-Kanu 's cross and Morrison 's scuffed half-volley crept into the corner .
Dawson almost pulled a goal back when his header was saved by Foster , but Hull never looked like mounting a comeback .

Shell Western Supply and Trading Limited , a subsidiary of Royal Dutch Shell and Guaranty Trust Bank have granted a $ 270 million loan to Amni International Petroleum Development Company Limited .
Amni is an independent oil and gas exploration and production company in Nigeria , with two producing offshore operations in Nigeria and an interest in a newly awarded block in Ghana . Amni owns its own infrastructure including platforms , pipelines and offshore terminals .
The terms of loan will give Shell Western Supply and Trading sole access to the 16,000 barrels per day ( bpd ) of oil the company pumps in two fields off Delta region .
The company 's production at offshore fields , including Amni 's Ima and Okoro/Setu , is difficult to maintain . But , Amni said the loan would allow them to further develop the fields .
The company also has an offshore concession in Ghana . According to the company 's Chief Executive , Tunde Afolabi , “ We are excited to work with GT Bank and Shell as commercial and financial partners to enable the realisation of Amni 's ambitious plans for growth . ”
When contacted , a spokesperson for Shell Western Supply and Trading Limited stated : “ Shell Western Supply and Trading Limited can confirm it has signed a loan agreement with Amni International as part of a package that includes long-term crude oil off-take contracts . We can not share further details about the deal for reasons of confidentiality . ”
The Group Head , Communication and External Affairs , GTbank , Oyinade Adegite , told Vanguard that , “ The release did not come from us . So , unfortunately , we do not have a statement available to send to you . We do not usually issue press statements for facilities and loans .
“ We will try and see if we can get a statement but we might not be able to come back to you on this till Monday . ”
In January , 2018 , oil trading firm , Vitol Group , reached a $ 530m deal with a Nigerian oil and gas producer , Shoreline Group , to finance an oilfield in exchange for access to some of the oil it produces , the Nigerian firm said on Thursday .
The agreement with Shoreline will provide the company with cash to refinance existing debt and further develop the Oil Mining Lease 30 in the Niger-Delta . The field currently produces 50,000 barrels per day and has an estimated one billion barrels of oil reserves . Shoreline has a 45 per cent interest in the field . The Chairman , Shoreline Group , Mr. Kola Karim , stated that the “ transformational ” deal would enable the company to step up gross production to as much as 100,000bpd over the next year .
“ The funds will be used to refinance existing debt and provide us with working capital to expand production . As part of the funding arrangements , Shoreline will work with Vitol to market the crude , and in the development of its export logistics capabilities , ” he said .
The financing was arranged with support from Vitol , as well as Ecobank Transnational Incorporated , Fidelity Bank Plc , Union Bank of Nigeria Plc , FCMB Group Plc and Farallon Capital Management LLC . The Federal Government is also turning to private companies in an effort to finance everything from refinery upgrades to oil pipeline reconstruction .
Bigger oil companies and trading houses often extend financing to smaller oil and gas producers in deals that allow the financier preferential access to physical cargoes and give the recipient companies the cash they can use to develop and maintain their assets .

.. Declares zero tolerance on accidents , disasters in workplace
By Olasunkanmi Akoni
As thick smoke continued to billow from Olusosun dumpsite in Ojota , as a result of fire outbreak , Lagos State Government , yesterday , directed residents within the community to relocate temporarily for health safety purposes and prevention of environmental hazards .
The directives came barely three days after the State Governor , Akinwunmi Ambode , conducted an on the spot assessment , saying , it was unhealthy to continue living beside the dumpsite .
The fire erupted at the site last Wednesday , due to environmental factors which had necessitated deployment of state fire service on 24-hour operation to prevent any ugly situation .
Director-General , Lagos State Safety Commission , Hakeem Dickson , gave the advice during a Press briefing to unveil the State new safety Strategy , tagged ‘ Vision Zero , ' held in Alausa , Ikeja .
Dickson stressed that the advice became necessary following the smoke that had continued to billow from the dumpsite , enveloping the community , including the toll-gate end of Lagos-Ibadan expressway .
He added that the other option on relocation for residents was to shut their windows , vents and stay indoors until the smoke subsides .
Meantime , apparently , worried by accident rates across the country , the Director-General disclosed that the state government is currently , working towards ensuring zero accident in the next three years .
According to him , the major reason the government launched the Vision Zero campaign was to ensure that corporate bodies and individuals in the state remain safety conscious .
However , he said Governor Akinwunmi Ambode , will sign a Safety Policy Document on safety during a 3-day workplace , scheduled for next month .
He said , “ Lagos Vision Zero is a transformational approach for prevention of accident that interprete the Tripod stand of Safety , Health and Wellbeing , at all levels at work ''
Dickson said it was borne out of the need to reduce to the barest minimum , hazards and risks in the workplace and ensure Zero Injury , Zero Accident , Zero Death and Promote Wellbeing and Health .
“ It is expected that at the end of the programme a workplace safety template will be developed for the state and by extension guarantee the well-being of all workers in the state , ” he said .

The future was foretold a number of years ago , when a keen-eyed photographer snapped two budding young players , in short trousers and kitted out in golf attire , sitting side-by-side and eating hamburgers . One of them was Jordan Spieth ; the other was Justin Thomas .
On Sunday evening , Thomas boarded a NetJets private charter back to his home in Kentucky , with a special seat reserved for his newest , prized asset : the Wanamaker Trophy .
With his as the most recent name engraved onto the old trophy , the biggest in size of all the Major championship silverware , the 24-year-old had positive proof of his arrival as a new power in professional golf .
And , indeed , Thomas – who 'd contended going into the final round of the US Open at Erin Hills in June only to crumble ( finishing tied-ninth ) and subsequently endured a series of missed cuts at the Travelers , the Quicken Loans National and the British Open before rediscovering equilibrium at the no-cut WGC-Bridgestone Invitational last week – demonstrated patience and maturity beyond his years to make the major step-up to claim the US PGA Championship at Quail Hollow .
In what was just his ninth appearance in a Major championship , Thomas – the son and grandson of professional golfers , admitting : “ As a kid growing up , being a golf fan , you want to win all the Majors . You want to win any Major . For me , the PGA definitely had a special place in my heart , and maybe a special drive ” – showed that the gene pool had produced the family 's greatest champion ; and with the prospect of yet more to come , as he looks set to become a rival as well as a friend to Spieth in contending for future titles .
On what he himself described as a “ crazy day , ” Thomas – from the bluegrass state of Kentucky – produced more than his fair share of craziness .
A monster putt for birdie on the ninth was followed by a lingering birdie putt on the 10th that hung over the lip for what seemed like an eternity ( in reality only seconds ) before falling in . . . and , then , on the 13th , he chipped in for another birdie to separate himself from what had been a five-way tie for the d and ultimately march on through the Green Mile to a two-stroke victory over Louis Oosthuizen , Patrick Reed and Francesco Molinari .
The birdie on the 10th was an indication of the golfing Gods bestowing favours . His tee shot , for starters , hit a tree and bounced back onto the fairway .
“ Get lucky , just spit it out for me , please , ” Thomas had talked to the ball in flight . And , when it did , he turned to his veteran caddie Jimmy Johnson and remarked , “ That 's why you ask ! ”
Iconic moment
But that was n't the end of it . Just minutes later , his birdie putt hung on the lip of the cup before falling in .
“ I did n't even see it go in . I was more so looking at Jimmy , asking , ‘ How does it not go in ? ' ” And it was only the roars from the galleries that alerted him to the ball finally deciding to drop in what became an iconic moment of his victory .
Then , of that chip-in on 13 which would prove crucial , Thomas observed : “ It 's tough to chip out of the rough , you can really look stupid in a heartbeat because it 's all into the grain and it 's really short to where you can just flub it . You can hit it right in front of you and if you try it play for that , it can come out hot and you can run it by . To have that chip come out perfectly , and exactly like I saw , and that was a roar like I 've never experienced . ”
To Thomas 's credit , he kept cool and calm – even when failing to birdie the drivable par four 14th or the par five 15th – and produced the killer blow with a birdie on the par three 17th .
It is worth noting , too , that Oosthuizen 's runner-up finish completed a Grand Slam of sorts : it meant he has now finished second in all four of the Major championships , as well – of course – as winning the Open at St Andrews in 2010 .
For Thomas , though , it was a win which confirmed a talent that first manifested as a young child – aged six – when he called on his father to watch him hit fades and draws with a natural ease .
Now a Major champion , the aim for Thomas is to become a multiple winner and also to use the momentum heading into the FedEx Cup playoffs .
As he put it , “ I know that a Major champion will never be taken away from , you know , after my name . Hopefully I 'm going to win some more , plenty more , a lot more , whatever . I know you ca n't get to two unless you get one . We 're getting to crunch time [ of the season ] and the FedExCup and the playoffs , and this puts me in a lot better position than I was before the week started . I 'm just excited for that . ”
Republican rep. Paul Ryan is back on his ish with a tweet that sent the internet into a tailspin . The Speaker of the House tweeted a link to an Associated Press report about how some workers are seeing a minuscule increase in their paychecks due to the GOP 's tax bill .
The story featured a high school secretary in Pennsylvania who said her paycheck increased by $ 1.50 a week , which she said would cover her Costco membership for the year . Ryan tweeted the story out , and although he quickly deleted it , the damage was done . Mother Jones caught a screenshot before it disappeared :

As we 've pointed out before , the tax cut is both small ( see above about the $ 1.50 ! ) and also temporary for most Americans — that is , except for the wealthy , who gained ( and will keep ! ) an enormous break . Last week , House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi was criticized by the GOP when she referred to companies giving $ 1,000 bonuses after the tax bill as “ crumbs . ”
Considering this , plenty of lawmakers , wonks , and people of all stripes were quick to jump on the ridiculousness of Ryan 's tweet :

Paul Ryan deleted his embarrassing tweet of a blatant admission because he and Republicans do n't want you to know the truth : the # GOPTaxScam is a gift to corporate America and the top 1 % at your expense .
He also does n't want you to know he got $ 500.000.00 from the Koch family . pic.twitter.com/ENXxASfAMP — Nancy Pelosi ( @ TeamPelosi ) February 3 , 2018
$ 1.50 a week for 52 weeks equals $ 78 per year , times 125 million workers that equals $ 9.75 billion a year .
Yet the tax cut costs $ 1.5 trillion — with a t — over ten years .
Where 'd the money go ? https : //t.co/RQKEPM75GC — Matthew Yglesias ( @ mattyglesias ) February 3 , 2018

Coffee Break : Mark Klein , Klein Tools in Lincolnshire
hello
Q : Describe your company .
A : Klein Tools is a six-generation , family-owned and family-run company and the second-oldest family business in Chicago . Klein Tools designs , develops and manufactures premium-quality , professional grade hand tools used in the construction , electronics and mining industries . We are the only major tool manufacturer worldwide focused on electrical and utility applications . 2017 marks an exciting year as we celebrate our 160th anniversary .
We are very proud to be an American manufacturer with seven facilities in five states . No other manufacturer of hand tools used in electrical applications makes more items in America than Klein Tools .
Q : If you had one tip to give to a rookie CEO , what would it be ?
A : Do n't be afraid to take chances . Learn from your mistakes and then try not make them again .
Q : Do you plan to hire any additional staff or make any significant capital investments in your company in the next year ?
A : Klein Tools will continue to invest in U.S. manufacturing and is committed to maintaining our place as the favorite among electricians . We plan to keep growing our U.S. footprint and investing in R & D to continue to lead the industry in product quality , performance and new product development .
We have invested more than $ 200 million in our Mansfield , Texas , facilities since they opened . Investing in our people is also a top priority for us , as is continuing to make Klein an attractive place to work . As a family business , we understand the value and power of a tightknit group of employees focused on the same goals and high standards .
Q : What was your first paying job ?
A : My first official job at Klein Tools was sweeping the floor in the manufacturing plant .
Over the years , during summers and breaks from high school and college , I worked in a variety of Klein roles from manufacturing to marketing , sales and customer service . It was a great way to learn about the major departments that make the company run .
Q : What will your company 's main challenges be in the next year ?
A : A challenge that hits close to home is the `` skills gap , '' which refers to the growing need for skilled labor in the U.S. Our recent state of the industry survey revealed that 78 percent of electricians surveyed believe there is a current shortage of electricians with sufficient job experience and 69 percent are concerned about the skills gap in the U.S. Labor Market .
Every day , 8,000 baby boomers hit retirement age , and the rigors of physically demanding trades make age a more significant factor than in less strenuous professions . Americans also tend not to encourage younger generations to pursue skilled trade professions , so there is an imbalance in the amount of experience among older and younger tradespeople , which needs outside influence to correct .
Q : What are you doing to help solve the problem ?
A : Many electricians believe that continuing education and on-the-job training will create a more experienced workforce . We continue to work with industry partners to ensure that young electricians and apprentices are receiving more on-the-job training . Our `` Double-Down Pledge '' involves investing $ 2 million over the next five years in training and educational programs . These organizations formed The Electrical Training Alliance , a joint program aimed at training the best electrical workers in the industry . The pledge will develop programs leveraging the unique capabilities and resources of IBEW-NECA and The Electrical Training Alliance , including scholarships and tool endowments for apprentices . This is a follow-up to our original and highly successful five-year `` A Million Dollar Pledge . ''
Q : Do you have a business mantra ?
A : `` Grow or die '' is a phrase that I have grown to appreciate over the years . We know that our company 's survival relies on growth and expanding our product lines . Our product line extension strategy has enabled us to weather downturns and offer tools for a variety of industries and uses .
Q : What is one important thing you learned growing up ?
A : Do n't forget to say please and thank you .
Q : What 's the hottest trend in your industry ?
A : Technology continues to innovate tool manufacturing . We are seeing electricians working on more high-tech installations , including smart homes and smart offices . Contractors are calling for more technicians who are skilled in newer , more digital-tech systems .
As the No . 1 preferred hand tool in the electrical industry , we continue to provide tradesman with the multifunctional tools they need to be more efficient . Our multifunctional tools are designed specifically to save time on the job site and allow our electricians to do more with less , with fewer trips to the tool bag .
Q : From a business outlook , whom do you look up to ?
A : My father , Mathias ( Mat ) Klein III , who retired as chairman of our company in 2015 after 46 years with Klein Tools . He helped transform the company into an innovative manufacturer and spearheaded much of our growth . He is also the one responsible for bringing me into the business .
Q : What is one interesting fact about you or your company that most people may not know ?
A : When my father first brought me into the business , he made me interview for my first job at Klein Tools . I had to bring a resume and go through several interviews to get the job .
Q : What do you like to do in your free time ?
A : I love spending time with my three kids and wife . Children grow up quick so I do n't want to miss anything .
Q : What book is on your nightstand ?
A : `` The Outsiders : Eight Unconventional CEOs and Their Radically Rational Blueprint for Success , '' by William Thorndike .
Q : If you were not doing this job , what do you think you would be doing ?
A : Living a healthy lifestyle has always been important to me , as well as helping others . I likely would have been a pediatrician as I enjoy the medical profession aspect and caring for kids in need . I joke with my three kids that , since I am the go-to person when one of them has an injury , they should call me `` Doctor Dad . ''
Q : If you could put your company name on a sports venue , which one would you choose ?
A : I grew up watching the Chicago Cubs , so it would have to be Wrigley Field .

A view inside of AT & T Stadium as preparations continue for the 2018 National Football League draft at the venue in Arlington , Texas Tuesday April 24 , 2018 . This is the first time an NFL draft is being held at a stadium . The draft starts Thursday and ends Saturday . ( Andy Jacobsohn/The Dallas Morning News )
The evidence was clear Tuesday as Finkelstein showed about a dozen reporters what the NFL typically refers to as its draft `` theater . ''
`` Everything 's bigger in Texas ; there 's no question , '' NFL senior director of event operations Eric Finkelstein said with a laugh . `` I can verify that . ''
This is the first time in the draft 's 83-year history that it will be held inside a stadium . Factor in that the Cowboys are the hosts and that no previous NFL draft has taken place in this football-crazy state and , well , you can guess the result .
ARLINGTON -- The first public glimpse of the NFL draft staging area inside AT & T Stadium occurred Tuesday , and , as expected , it was an eye-opener .
Except in this case the Thursday-through-Saturday draft will take place in roughly one-quarter of 100,000-seat AT & T Stadium , specifically in the stadium 's east end .
That `` draft theater '' portion of the stadium has been curtained off , but its dimensions alone are immense . Consider these facts provided by Finkelstein :
This draft is expected to accommodate more than 20,000 fans at a time -- free of charge -- during each of the three days . The largest estimated draft crowd up until now is slightly over 4,000 at New York 's Radio City Music Hall , which hosted the event nine times , most recently in 2014 .
This draft will use `` by far '' the most LED lighting of any previous draft . Also , AT & T Stadium has been adorned with the most wire rigging for any event in its history , concerts included .
For the first time , the floor area in front of the podium will have individual sections set aside for fans of each of the NFL 's 32 teams . There are 1,600 chairs -- 50 fans per team , chosen by the teams . Fans of NFC teams will be on the right side of the floor , facing the stages , and AFC team fans will be on the left . The setup is similar to that of national political conventions .
The free NFL Draft Experience that will take place on various staging areas outside the stadium encompasses more than 900,000 square feet . That is more than twice the 400,000 square feet used for the Draft Experience last year in Philadelphia , which drew a record 250,000 fans .
`` Our goal was to accommodate more people than ever before , '' Finkelstein said . `` But , also -- this is going to sound weird in a stadium as vast as this -- try to keep it as intimate as possible . ''
In addition to floor seating , there are about 200 seats on a separate platform near the podium . Those are for on-location fans getting a premium experience that includes behind-the-scenes tours , access to the Red Carpet Experience and photos at the podium .
The remaining fans viewing the draft will sit in the stadium seats or watch from the standing-room-only areas .
Though admission is free , fans must have a ticket to enter . The NFL made 60,000 free tickets available through a lottery and began notifying winners in March .
In addition , some fans attending the Draft Experience still have an opportunity to come inside AT & T Stadium to see the draft by downloading the NFL Draft 2018 Fan Mobile Pass app and registering for standby tickets . NFL officials will keep a close watch for any seats that open up . Fans on the waiting list will be notified through the app and ushered to seats .

She wrote : `` I 've been so touched by the warm response to Tara 's death . Thank you from the whole family . But I 'd like to clarify a couple of points .
`` Today the coroner 's report states that Tara died of natural causes - a perforated ulcer . She did not have a brain tumour . ''
Montefiore added that `` contrary to some reports , Tara was not the goddaughter of HRH the Prince of Wales '' .

January is the time where we all look at ourselves and make lots of bold statements about massive lifestyle changes , most of which we do n't keep .
No doubt gyms around Reading are already preparing for the annual flurry of memberships from people , some of whom are unlikely to go again after their induction .
Diets will be started and booze will be ditched , at least for a few days .
This annual exercise got getreading thinking about the concept of resolutions .
We started talking about what needed to be done to improve life in Reading , and have come up with some resolutions for the town for 2017 .
We 've taken a look at what Reading Borough Council councillors could do and suggested a few ideas for Reading FC fans and the team 's manager Jaap Stam .
But we 've also taken a look at how people in the town can make a difference too .
Nine resolutions Reading can make for 2017
1 . Keep complaining
Regular readers may notice a fair bit of moaning goes on .
Reading 's Labour councillors endlessly highlight the financial nightmare they are facing in the face on seemingly endless Government cuts , and so they should .
If they feel they 're not getting a fair deal , they should continue to highlight this .
This affects most people in Reading as taxpayers .
Regardless of whether you agree with Government spending cuts or not , the council is endlessly fighting and facing endless issues in providing the services it is told to provide by the Government .

The indisputable fact is that people in Reading are looking at paying more council tax in return for fewer services .
Some might be fine with that , some might not be .
Some of our readers are critical of the council for what they deem to be endless bleating .
But if they just shut up and accept it , are they doing what the people of Reading voted them in for , which is the best for the town ?
2 . Commuters need to keep moaning

Travel into London every day ? Reluctantly accept never getting a seat ? Reluctantly accept late trains and price rises ?
Well stop .
The stats say Great Western Railway 's services are improving but a look at Twitter on any given day shows people are still unsatisfied with the service from Reading , so why not resolve to try to get more improvements ?
You are paying more , and probably will next year , and the year after , so if they 're taking more money from you , you 're well within your rights to let them know when you 're an unhappy customer .
Tell them , constantly , and demand improvements for your extra cash .
This wo n't guarantee the service will improve , or that prices wo n't increase , but neither will sitting quietly .
3 . Keep the look of the town
One of the most commendable things about Reading 's much-criticised council is the dedication it shows to trying to keep the old look of the town .
Jackson 's Corner is the prime example .
The building is being converted to flats , but it 's not losing its famous sign or frontage .
Horrible old buildings like King 's Point are being mercilessly knocked down , but the council is looking to keep anything of architectural value looking how it always has , regardless of any development .
You 'd think most people would agree with this policy and long may it continue .
4 . Keep us updated on the swimming pools

The council 's closure of the Arthur Hill Pool in King 's Road kicked up a right stink in the late part of 2016 .
Despite strong financial arguments , sturdy running costs of £120,000 plus the need for a costly £700,000 refurbishment , the council 's decision to close the 105-year-old pool was met with fury from users , who correctly point out it leaves the East Reading area without a pool .
The council has formulated a new plan which will eventually see some pretty good sounding swimming facilities built on land at Rivermead Leisure Centre in Richfield Avenue and at Palmer Park in Wokingham Road .
But there remains a level of cynicism among protesters , who have launched their own plan to take over the running of the Arthur Hill Pool , over the proposed pool at Palmer Park .
The council should resolve to put out as much information on these projects as possible during the course of 2017 .
5 . Keep on at the Government about Green Park station
Reading does not want a snazzy new train station where trains do n't stop - that would be stupid .
And while it 's not the council 's responsibility to build a station and ensure the lines to it are electrified , you 'd hope Coucillor Tony Page , lead member for strategic environment , planning and transport , has it in his diary to try to resolve what could end up being a comical episode .
Reading West MP Alok Sharma has also been working on the project .
The station is due to open in December 2018 , but as it stands the line electrification is n't due until 2019 , leaving the very distinct possibility of Reading having a station with no trains .
Of course , there 's not a great deal Cllr Page can do in this situation , but he 'll be aware as anyone a potentially ludicrous situation could be developing .
6 . Reading FC fans can cheer the team into the play-offs

The plea for excessive moaning earlier was very much not aimed at football fans , quite the opposite .
Jaap Stam has done a brilliant job in charge of Reading FC this season , but it 's fair to say some fans were slow to take to his brand of passing football .
But under his leadership Royals find themselves in third place in the Championship and with their best chance in years of getting back into the Premier League .
The boss is looking to strengthen his side , with a striker an absolute priority .
The fans have an important role in the second part of the season , which is simply to turn up , shout a lot , cheer on the team and try not to get on their backs on the occasions , like at Leeds , where the passing game does n't go to plan .
7 . Jaap Stam needs to stick to the passing game

This is a given , the big Dutchman resolved this years ago .
There 's no way Reading will embrace the big hoof any time soon .
8 . Make big steps on a Third Thames Bridge
Who says New Year 's resolutions have to be realistic ?
Look at the picture above from 21 years ago , and that 's recent in this particular saga .
Reading East MP Rob Wilson and the council , who are unlikely to have received Christmas cards from each other , may want to consider resolving to put their differences to one side to try to solve the long , long-term issue of a Third Bridge over the Thames .
The problem , is , and always has been , councillors in Oxfordshire 's fairly reasonable protest at having a load of traffic from Reading dumped on to their roads .
The debate has gone on for decades already and no solution has ever been found to this .
It would be a magnificent thing to make big ground in this project in 2017 .
Both parties will be aware of the political capital they can make if they are able to get the project underway .
Short of the Government giving the council a few billion quid , which would lead to 10 years of roadworks and traffic jams , this could be the best way to ease the traffic problem in Reading , so let 's see if we can give it another go .
9 . Cut food waste
After shocking figures revealed an eye-watering 22,836 tonnes of food waste is thrown away in Reading , Wokingham and Bracknell every year perhaps it 's time we vowed to reduce the amount we are binning ?
It 's estimated food waste costs the average UK household £470 a year , so we could all make a huge saving too .
Re3 , which manages waste in Bracknell Forest , Reading and Wokingham , has discovered a typical household in the area throws away 1.2kg of food a week that was not prepared or taken out if its packaging .
So let 's make 2017 the year we stop buying so much and start using up what we have .
Re3 have put together 12 top tips to help families reduce waste and make the most of their weekly shop .

One question has always haunted me during my years playing Pokémon . If people eat meat in the Pokémon universe , and there are no other animals that players see or interact with but Pokémon , what are they eating ? Series director Junichi Masuda says not even he knows .
Masuda has worked on every single Pokémon game at Game Freak , so when I recently went to a press event to ask him about Let 's Go Pikachu and Eevee , I saw my chance to finally get an answer to my burning question .
When I started playing Pokémon games as a child , it did n't even cross my mind that people would eat Pokémon , but some inconsistencies in the anime piqued my interest . In early installments of the anime which began in 1997 , you 'd see Ash and his friends eat meat . Sometimes they 'd have a big leg of ambiguous animal meat , other times a hamburger . My coworker Cecilia D'Anastasio sent me this image of Brock and Ash daydreaming about Magikarp Sashimi today , and while I can not confirm which episode this came from , it 's sometimes referenced as proof that people do in fact eat Pokémon . I also think it 's just horrifying to look at . Do n't do this to Magikarp !

As the show went on , though , these references to meat eating and real world animals diminished , probably because the creators realized they 'd disturbed enough children like me . In Pokémon fandom , the anime , especially the early installments , are not strictly considered canon . Even if Ash eats a Pokéburger , that might not mean they eat Pokébabs in Alola .

The games are more ambiguous about whether or not Pokémon are okay to eat . There are instances of people consuming Pokémon by-products in the Pokémon games . When the Pokémon Miltank was introduced in Pokémon Gold and Silver , its Pokédex entry reads , “ It is widely known that drinking Miltank milk when you 're young helps you grow up to be strong and healthy. ” In many games , Pokémon poachers also cut off the tails of Slowpokes and sell them , as they 're apparently considered a delicacy . Cutting off Slowpoke tails to sell them was what Team Skull was getting up to in Pokémon Sun and Moon . Even more confusingly , Pokémon are often described in the Pokédex in relation to animals we 're familiar with . Pikachu , for instance , is the described as similar to a mouse , even though you 'll never see a mouse in a Pokémon game . But do people actually eat Pokémon like you and I would eat a steak ?
When I asked Masuda what kind of meat people in the Pokémon universe eat , he laughed and said , “ I 'm actually curious about that as well. ” If someone with such a fundamental role in shaping the Pokémon world does n't know , maybe we never will . Or maybe Masuda is trying to shield Pokémon fans about a harsh truth about the survival of the fittest .

THE Water Resources Management Authority ( WARMA ) has clarified that the K250 required from members of the public who own or intend to drill boreholes will be a one-off payment and not a monthly charge .
WARMA acting director general Lemmy Namayanga said owners of both new and old boreholes will be required to pay K250 registration fee within the next six months .
Government recently issued three out of the eight Statutory Instruments ( SIs ) on revision of raw water tariffs and regulation in drilling of boreholes and ground water .
Mr Namayanga said at a media briefing on Sunday that introduction of the… http : //epaper.daily-mail.co.zm/
Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko has called for an end to Moscow 's rule over his country 's Orthodox church , saying it would inspire the nation and help it reclaim Crimea and the war-ravaged Donbas region from Russia and its proxies .
In Kiev 's latest bid to break centuries of Russian domination , Mr Poroshenko , parliament and some church leaders in Ukraine have asked the spiritual head of the world 's Orthodox Christians to grant independence to the Ukrainian church , over which the Moscow Patriarchate claims authority .
Longstanding divisions between rival Orthodox churches in Ukraine have deepened since it ousted pro-Kremlin leaders in a 2014 revolution and Russia responded by annexing Crimea and fomenting a separatist war in eastern provinces .
The bid to secure independence , or autocephaly , for the Ukrainian Orthodox Church “ will cause a huge upsurge in the national spirit ” , Mr Poroshenko said .
“ I would like to emphasise that the Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church is a key element of our statehood and independence . The army defends the Ukrainian land . The language protects the Ukrainian heart . The church protects the Ukrainian soul , ” he said on national television on Monday night .
Mr Poroshenko insisted that recognition of an independent Ukrainian Orthodox church would help “ eliminate internal strife and conflicts within the state ” .
“ Having united , we will liberate the Ukrainian land faster . Both Crimea and the Donbas , ” he declared .
‘ Overwhelming support '
After a meeting in Istanbul earlier this month with Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew , Mr Poroshenko secured the overwhelming support of parliament in Kiev to request his formal recognition of an independent national church .
The move is also backed by the heads of the Kiev Patriarchate and a smaller , existing autocephalous Ukrainian Orthodox church , which are not recognised by the Russian Orthodox Church or the Moscow Patriarchate in Ukraine .
The Holy and Sacred Synod chaired by Patriarch Bartholomew said on Sunday that it had received Ukraine 's request and would “ closely communicate and co-ordinate with its sister Orthodox Churches concerning this matter ” .
Ukraine 's petition raises questions of Orthodox history going back to 1686 , when church authority over Kiev was transferred from Constantinople to Moscow – a move Mr Poroshenko now wants to reverse .
The Russian Orthodox Church has drawn close to the Kremlin under President Vladimir Putin , and in Ukraine clerics of the Moscow Patriarchate have been accused of backing Russian-led militia in Donbas and the annexation of Crimea .
In 2012 , the then head of the Russian Orthodox Church described Mr Putin 's rule as “ a miracle of God ” ; two years later , by contrast , the leader of the Kiev Patriarchate called him “ a new Cain ” who had “ fallen under the actions of Satan ” .
The Kremlin has denounced Mr Poroshenko 's church initiative , and critics see it as a bid to boost his popularity before elections next year .

Christian Benteke was placed on Aston Villa 's scouting database by Alex McLeish , BirminghamLive can reveal .
Paul Lambert signed the Belgian striker in 2012 for £6million from Genk - but it was actually his fellow Scot McLeish who identified Benteke .
Benteke , who now plies his trade for Crystal Palace after his £30m switch to Liverpool backfired , spent three years at Villa Park and scored the goals to preserve their top flight status under Lambert and , latterly , Tim Sherwood .
But it was n't Lambert or scout Paddy Riley who pinpointed Benteke as a potential target . McLeish marked him out as one to watch shortly after he made the ill-fated move across the Second City from Birmingham City .
McLeish , now manager of Scotland , was bemused to arrive at Villa and discover the club had n't implemented a scouting database to keep tabs on targets from across the globe .
Benteke , who scored 49 goals in 101 appearances in claret and blue , was put forward to McLeish by scout Arthur Numan .
Numan watched Benteke regularly whilst he was playing for Genk - a club McLeish would later manage - and thought Villa could grab themselves a bargain .
McLeish 's appointment at Villa Park came at a time when owner Randy Lerner was reining in the spending . Previous managers Martin O'Neill and Gerard Houllier had been backed heavily in the transfer market and Lerner demanded cuts were made .
McLeish was asked to reduce the wage bill and decided to expand Villa 's scouting horizons in the hope of snaring a few gems .
The decision to include Benteke 's name on the database he installed and ensure Numan and other scouts continued to watch the 6ft 4in frontman was key in the club 's decision to sign him .
Papiss Cisse , who eventually joined Newcastle United and fired them to a fifth-placed finish , was another player on the database , as was Gylfi Sigurdsson .

A drugs kingpin flew over £7 million of cocaine into Britain by landing in a helicopter on the roofs of luxury hotels .
The drugs were then passed onto dealers in Birmingham , London and Liverpool , a court heard .
Southwark crown court was told how the cocaine was hidden in a secret compartment in the helicopter which was flown into the UK from the Continent .
Two men have been jailed for a total of 25 years for their part in the elaborate plan , while a third will be sentenced next week .
Frederic Fagnoul , from Belgium , and John Bolter and Dean Francis , both from London , took part in the smuggling operation .
The court heard how the Metropolitan Police 's Organised Crime Command identified Fagnoul as the organiser of the plan .
Detectives found that Fagnoul arranged for the specially-modified helicopter to take around 50kg of cocaine on each flight .
When buttons were pressed on the helicopter 's fobs , trap doors beneath the four seats would open to reveal cavities underneath where the drugs were hidden .
The helicopter would land at helipads at two hotels in Kent , where the drugs would then be distributed via car to multiple dealers in the UK , including Birmingham .
The court heard how Fagnoul used a cover story when he landed at the hotel that he was a wealthy businessman who had been night fishing and he only filed his flight plan 10 minutes before setting off .
Police eventually caught Fagnoul and Bolter last September , while Francis was caught a month later .
Fagnoul , 50 , of Fennieres , Belgium , pleaded guilty to conspiracy to import Class A drugs and conspiracy to supply Class A drugs and was jailed for 17 years and six months .
Bolter , 36 , of Effort Street , Tooting , pleaded guilty to possession with intent to supply and was sentenced to seven and a half years in jail .
Francis , 37 , of Knighton Park Road , Lewisham , admitted conspiracy to supply Class A drugs and will be sentenced on April 26 .
The Belgian pilot of the helicopter waas cleared by a jury after insisting he had no knowledge of the illicit cargo beneath him .

iStock/Thinkstock ( WASHINGTON ) — The Pentagon says Russian aircraft flew low and fast above an American destroyer in the Black Sea last week in an “ unsafe and unprofessional ” manner and a Russian intelligence vessel has been detected heading north along the eastern coast of the United States .
On Feb. 10 , the Navy destroyer USS Porter noted three “ unsafe and unprofessional ” encounters with Russian military aircraft while in the Black Sea . In each of the incidents Russian aircraft approached the destroyer at an unspecified “ low altitude ” and some were at “ high speed ” .
The Russian aircraft did not have their transponders on and did not respond when the destroyer 's crew hailed the planes on radio .
“ Such incidents are concerning because they can result in accident or miscalculation , ” said Lt . Colonel Michelle Baldanza , a Pentagon spokesman .
Last April Russian fighters repeatedly buzzed an American destroyer in the Baltic Sea , with one pass coming as close as 30 feet to the USS Donald Cook . That incident was one of several close encounters between the U.S. and Russian militaries in 2016 , but officials have said recently that such encounters had become infrequent .
At the time of the incident Baldanza said the destroyer was “ conducting routine maritime operations in international waters in the Black Sea following the conclusion of Exercise Sea Shield . ”
According to Baldanza the first encounter involved a Russian Ilyushin 38 , a maritime patrol and anti-submarine aircraft . The plane “ flew in an unsafe and unprofessional manner due to the unusually low altitude ” above the USS Porter .
The second incident involved two SU-24 fighters and the third a different Su-24 .
Meanwhile American officials are not expressing concern about the presence of a Russian intelligence gathering ship headed northward along the East Coast . The White House deferred comment to the Defense Department on this issue .
According to a U.S. official , the Russian intelligence vessel Viktor Leonov was located 70 miles off the coast of Delaware yesterday in international waters heading in a northerly direction . American territorial waters extend 12 miles out to sea .
The official said the speculation is that the Russian ship is headed near the U.S. Navy 's submarine base at New London , Connecticut .
Russian military monitoring of U.S. sub bases used to happen frequently during the Cold War , but became infrequent after the fall of the Soviet Union .
In 2015 , another Russian spy ship made its way south along the East Coast past the sub base at Kings Bay , Georgia , but was apparently mapping underwater communications cables off the Florida coast .
If the Leonov follows previous deployment patterns it will eventually head too south to Cuba .
The official says there is not much concern about the Leonov 's movements or its intelligence gathering capabilities .
The Russian ship was in the mid-Atlantic a month ago and made a port of call in Kingston , Jamaica in early February .

Fortnite got a big patch last night , but one of the changes to the game is n't listed anywhere . To see it , you 'll have to head down to Tilted Towers , where Epic has added some new items on a roof that seem to poke fun at players waiting for the comet event to unfold .
As many of you know , for the last month , there 's been a lot of commotion surrounding comets and meteors in Fortnite . While none of the celestial items have caused impact with the Fortnite map yet , one of the leading theories is that the meteors will hit Tilted Towers , and possibly level that area of the map—or at least change it somehow . Players swear that all evidence points toward this theory : something is going to happen at Tilted Towers , potentially by the end of the current Fortnite season .
Today , anyone dropping into Tilted Towers will see the scene at the top of this post . Epic have arranged items to look like conspiracy theorists are camping up there . There 's a telescope that is pointed right at the comet :
If you look closer , you 'll notice a variety of different signs , some of which are space-themed , while others make it seem like the people waiting want to get hit by something :
Advertisement
But the sign that makes it look like Epic is poking fun at players is this one , where one hopeful onlooker wrote “ TODAY ” only to cross it off and write “ tomorrow ” under it . This appears to be a callback to the day earlier this month , where nearly the entire playerbase was convinced that the Towers would be hit—but nothing happened .
Advertisement
Right now , pretty much the entire community might as well be holding up this today sign .
Is it likely that something actually will happen tomorrow though ? Maybe , but probably not . For one , the season does n't end until April 30th , and that seems like better timing for the conclusion of the entire alien/space-themed event as a whole . The next Fortnite patch seems to be scheduled two days from now , when the new Battle Pass challenges drop . Also , according to dataminers TwoEpicBuddies—who have successfully predicted updates in the past—the comets wo n't necessarily be Tilted-Towers specific :
Advertisement
We reached out to Epic to ask about the nature of these signs , but did not hear back in time for publication . But , if nothing else , the general tone of the signs feels lighthearted , as if Epic is winking to Fortnite fans . At this point , with all the hype everyone has built up , they kinda had to do something with Tilted Towers . This might be it .

BRADFORD — To get past Jeromesville Hillsdale in Friday 's IV state semifinal game , the Bradford softball team would need to do something no team has accomplished this tournament season .
Hillsdale , the No . 1 ranked team in the Ohio High School Fastpitch Softball Coaches Association 's Division IV state rankings , has n't given up a run thus far in the Ohio High School Athletic Association tournament . But that does n't scare Bradford , which has grown accustomed to accomplishing unprecedented feats this season .
“ It 's just another team , ” Bradford freshman pitcher Skipp Miller said . “ Do n't think of it any more than that . ”
Bradford has gained confidence throughout the season as the Railroaders have posted a 22-3 record and earned the No . 10 ranking in the Division IV state poll . They 've made it farther in the tournament than any team in program history and energized their community .
“ It 's been amazing how much they 've supported us you know financially and coming to the games , ” Bradford coach Shon Schaffer said . “ It 's been amazing how many people has been at the last couple games . ”
Hundreds of fans made the trip to the Railroaders ' district championship game at Mason then their regional tournament games in Greenville . Now they 've taken up donations to rent a charter bus for the team to take to Akron .
“ I did n't think there would be all these people supporting us , ” freshman Emma Canan said .
The Bradford community has waited a long time for a team as good as this year 's softball squad to support .
School officials went scouring through trophy cases and record books this past week to find any teams in Bradford history that could match the accomplishments of this year 's softball squad . The only other team they found that reached the state semifinals of an OHSAA tournament was the 1982 football team .
But the Railroaders know if they want to keep this magical journey going , it 's going to take a great effort against a Hillsdale team that has won six state championships in program history and has another solid group this year .
“ It will be the best team we 've faced so far , which you can understand because they 're one of the last four teams , ” Schaffer said . “ But they 're really fast , probably faster defense than Newton , which I think Newton is impressive being fast , and I think they 're a little bit quicker on defense . And as far as hitting goes they 're pretty stout through their four and five batter , and it does n't drop off much through the end of their order . And they 've got a couple really fast left-handers , and it 's going to be a challenge for our defense . ”
Hillsdale also has a strong pitcher who has n't given up a run in tournament play .
“ She 's a really nice pitcher , ” Schaffer said . “ She throws really hard and places the ball extremely well . That 's probably her strong suit is her ability to place it inside and outside , up , down . From what we saw she had very good control , and we 're going to have to get the count in our favor so we can hit our pitch otherwise we 'll be hitting her pitch , and it gets a little bit more difficult . ”
Bradford can counter with its own ace pitcher in Miller , who as a freshman has an ERA of 0.77 and already is verbally committed to Ohio University .
“ I think if we do what we did with Parkway , I think if we put the bat on the ball like we can , I think good things will happen , ” Schaffer said . “ I do n't think Skipp with let up too many runs so just like every game we 've played this year I tell them if we can score a couple runs we have a shot . ”
Bradford showed it can put up runs against top competition in the regional finals . Parkway entered Saturday 's regional championship game ranked second in the state rankings , but Bradford was unfazed and run-ruled the Panthers 12-1 in six innings to secure a berth in the state final four .
“ It was actually really surprising because we were told all week that it was n't going to be a blowout , ” senior Bailey Wysong said . “ We were going to maybe score one or two runs then when we started putting runs on the board it was outstanding .
“ I think once one person started hitting we all knew that it was possible . ”
Against Parkway , Bradford got some momentum at the plate that carried throughout the lineup . The Railroaders will aim for that same success against Hillsdale .
“ I think if we 're on our game we 'll be fine , ” junior Elisa Martinez said .
Bradford will get a chance to prove itself when it plays Hillsdale at 10 a.m. Friday at Firestone Stadium in Akron in the first of two Division IV state semifinals . The winner of that game will play either Defiance Tinora or Strasburg-Franklin at 4 p.m. Saturday in the Division IV state championship game at Firestone Stadium .
Schaffer does n't want his team to look too far ahead , though , and is taking things day by day and even hour by hour . Regardless of the outcome this weekend , the Railroaders already have shown him how special they are .
“ I 've never been more proud of a team , ” Schaffer said .

It might be a case that bookmakers might offer live feeds of matches , you can click here to see a list of some great online betting companies
Although not everything is as it seems . According to The Times the Premier League will be negotiating for a deal that will include Saturday 7.45 pm kick offs in the Premier League as they look to televise at least half of the 380 games a season .
The number of live Premier League games has soared in the past 16 years , with there having been 60 between 1992-2001 , 106 between 2001-04 , 138 between 2004-13 and 154 between 2013-16 .
Ofcom launched a two-year investigation into how the rights were sold following a complaint by Virgin Media that the proportion of live games made available was lower than some other leading European leagues , contributing to higher prices for consumers .
A move like such will most definitely annoy fans with 5.30 pm kick offs and evening weekday kick off times difficult enough to get home from without the addition of the late weekend kick offs too .
At the moment both Sky Sports and BT Sport split the showing of 168 games per season between them . With the proposed change the league is hoping to up that to at least 190 games .
More midweek games would risk annoying UEFA who have already complained about domestic games being scheduled at the same time as its competitions . Another clash for the Premier League are the big La Liga matches often kick-off at 8 pm on a Saturday .
The chairman of the Football Supporters ' Federation , Malcolm Clarke , saying when the Ofcom investigation was launched : “ We 'd have major reservations about a further significant increase in televised football. ” He added : “ Football eats itself sometimes . We 're talking about £8bn in [ global ] TV revenues , right ?
“ Well , the X-Men movie franchise is £10bn , so let 's get context about how big this business really is against how big it really could be . ”
A decision will be made in Autumn when clubs vote on whether to accept the new kick-off times .

Holidays are stressful and expensive - but heading to the airport shop does n't need to hit you hard in the pocket .
According to thrifty shopping guru Martin Lewis , by refusing to show your boarding pass you could get cheaper deals .
The Sunday Mirror columnist and MoneySavingExpert.com founder says unless you 're buying duty-free goods like alcohol or tobacco , you do n't actually have to show your travel ticket .
Holiday-bound shoppers mistakenly think they have to show the cashier their boarding pass for every departure lounge purchase due to security reasons .
But you do n't have to , and security is not the reason shops ask for your pass . They ask so they can increase their profit and pay less tax , as they can claim duty back on your purchases if you are flying outside the EU , the Newcastle Chronicle reports .
But these savings are not often passed back to the customer , something which MoneySavingExpert is campaigning to change by refusing to show his boarding pass until shops slash the duty saving off the sale price .
Here , Martin clears up the misconception .

Do I need to show my boarding pass in shops ?
No . There 's no legal requirement to do so , except in Duty Free .
So why do I keep being nagged to show it ?
If you 're flying outside the EU the shop can reclaim the VAT paid , which adds up to big money . Your pass is proof of destination .
What 's the point of “ not showing it ” even when they do n't need to see it ?
`` This is n't an anti-capitalist stance to cut shops ' profit . It 's because I believe – and ministers have mooted similar – that at least part of the VAT should go to the customers , not the store .
`` It 's my hope that enough no-shows will push shops to behave fairly and pass on some or all of the VAT gain they get from non-EU customers .
`` Do n't be rude to staff . Just politely say no , or calmly explain why you wo n't show it . This stance has already started to pay dividends . ''

Are some shops starting to give the VAT back ?
Yes . For example , if you 're travelling outside the EU and buying an item costing more than £5 at Boots , show your boarding pass and you now get the VAT gain – so you only pay £8.33 for something priced at £10 . Though sadly it 's only on the individual item , not the whole basket .
WHSmith Travel , whose self-service tills still annoyingly require you to scan your boarding pass ( call the assistant over to buy without ) now has a similar stance on items over £6 .
Can they refuse to serve me if I wo n't show my pass ?
Yes , any shop can refuse your custom ( unless it 's doing it for discriminatory reasons , e.g . over race ) . It 's up to you to decide if it 's worth it .
Why is it different in Duty Free shops ?
These shops sell goods , usually booze and tobacco , where the excise and customs duty as well as the VAT is suspended .
To do this the HMRC requires these stores to know where passengers are travelling to . So here you must show your boarding pass .
Do remember this , as over the last couple of years many Duty Free staff have unfairly been given abuse .
Some smaller Duty Free branches do n't sell items with duty on , e.g . only sunglasses or perfume , yet they must still see your pass .
And do n't forget the fact it 's Duty Free does n't automatically mean it is cheaper than elsewhere .

Golf has been called many things – “ an expensive way of playing marbles ” ( Chesterton ) , “ an insult to lawns ” ( National Lampoon ) , “ a plague invented by Calvinist Scots as a punishment for man 's sins ” ( James Barrett Reston ) and Twain 's famous “ good walk spoiled ” .
The late and very great Arnold Palmer , unexpectedly , thought it a possible vehicle for world peace . Golf for him was a universal language brimming with the forging of new friendships and with deep and ancient traditions of honour , respect and personal accountability .
Eric Trump , the president 's son , thinks so , too . In a New York Times interview , he praised his father 's unusual capacity to make connections on a golf course , with Mar-a-Lago being the perfect venue for world diplomacy .
“ If he could do that with Putin , ” he said , “ if he could do that with some of these horrible actors around the world who only want to compromise us as a country , and if he can make friends and they can trust one another , he just did something that not many presidents have been able to do . ”
President Trump has already played a round with the Japanese prime minister , Shinzo Abe . ( Abe presented Trump with a $ 3,755 gold driver when he became president . ) Golf is long established in Japan and Abe 's grandfather played with Eisenhower . But China 's Xi-Jinping came and went without lifting a club . Israel PM Benjamin Netanyahu pointedly counted himself out from golf during a press conference with Obama . Could you entice karate black belt and bare-chested horse rider Vladimir Putin into plaid pants and tassled shoes ?
Politicians can be wary of golf . “ Photograph me on horseback ? Yes , ” wrote Teddy Roosevelt in 1908 . “ Tennis , no . And golf is fatal. ” It 's the frivolousness of it , the look of a childish pastime played by posh boys who know nothing of the world . Roosevelt 's contrast with being on horseback is revealing . He might have thought golf not only insufficiently serious but also insufficiently masculine . The clothes work against you .
George W Bush could look manly in jeans and a Stetson clearing wood on his ranch , but the famous clip of him exhorting the world to stand up to terrorism , then declaring “ now watch this drive ” before striding to the tee , did him a lot of harm . Michael Moore put it in Fahrenheit 9/11 . Bush soon stopped playing golf , or at least being seen to do so , as he did n't think it fitted with his role as commander-in-chief after the invasion of Iraq .
Even Trump , named “ golfer-in-chief ” by Golf Digest , repeatedly castigated his predecessor for “ playing more golf than Tiger Woods ” . “ I 'm going to be working for you , ” he told Virginians during the campaign . “ I 'm not going to have time to play golf. ” ( According to the New York Times , he has visited a golf course 19 times in the past 13 weeks , compared with Bush Jr 's and Obama 's zero and Clinton 's three over the same period of their presidencies ; this is around double the rate of Obama 's tally of just over 300 rounds over two terms .
Only one of Trump 's golf outings appears to have involved “ international diplomacy ” . It 's an ensnaring game . In China it 's been called “ green opium ” . Trump as president has a rhythm of life continuity with Trump as businessman : weekdays at the city office , weekends at Mar-a-Lago and his nearby Jim Fazio-designed course at West Palm Beach , one of the state 's best . )
There is a term in golf known as “ the clerical 12 ” . It refers to a handicap of above-average proficiency , not so high as to be risible , but not so low as to indicate too much time spent away from the flock . It is a handicap meant for public consumption . Most declared US presidential handicaps have been of the clerical kind – Reagan , Nixon and Ford , 12 ; George W , Clinton and Kennedy , 10 . All but four US presidents since the beginning of the 20th century golfed . Woodrow Wilson played more than 1,000 rounds , playing almost every day , and even , like Kipling , in the snow , using balls painted black .

The usual public explanation given for presidents taking to a golf course for numerous hours is their need for “ relief from stress ” . ( This seems to me to be like betting on junk bonds , hang gliding or writing novels to relieve stress , though it is true there are those who take their golf easy . )
Trump or his son , or White House press secretary Sean Spicer , are innovators in their focus on golf as an arena for international diplomacy . Golf has certainly been associated with deal-making . It originally spread globally through Scots soldiers wishing to play their favourite game but , once established , the golf club tended to comprise the aspiring or established local elites . You could get on in business by joining .
They are like Masonic lodges in their concentration of economic and political power . There are several in England that are simply extensions of public school , where men can gather without women , eat the same food and call each other by the same nicknames as they did at school , while at the same time settling the interest rate or the privatisation of the rail service .
In Japan , golf became a ritualistic expression of corporate loyalty . There are some precedents for political deal-making by US presidents . Obama played with John Boehner , Republican speaker of the House of Representatives , in the hope of lifting deadlock , and Lyndon Johnson did the same with senators to get his civil rights legislation passed . Condoleezza Rice , now a member of the venerable Augusta National club , thinks golf useful for diplomacy , but only because it teaches patience and the acceptance of setbacks .
Can geopolitical deals be made on a golf course ? There are obstacles . You have about four hours on the course together , but , even if the two global players are riding together in a buggy with an interpreter hanging on at the back , there are the constant interruptions of club selection , scorekeeping and searches for errant balls . But then there is the drink or lunch afterwards , and by this time humour has likely been exchanged , foibles and skills exposed , partners rooted for and opponents congratulated .
Golf would seem to have a near-magical ability to bring highly diverse people on to common ground . It does the same work as empathy without the need for an empathetic nature . There is something inherently disarming about it . Trump is said to excel at being good company on a golf course . He 's generous , affable , solicitous and hospitable . He 's usually the host , playing at a course he owns , and wants his guest to have a good time .
“ Golf bears down on you and illuminates character , ” Arnold Palmer said . “ There 's the expression in vino , veritas , and certainly golf , like alcohol , can bring out the true person that may otherwise be hidden . ”
What does golf reveal about Trump ?
He is likely to be the most skilful player of all US presidents , at least while in office . ( Kennedy might have given him a run for it but for a bad back , and Franklin D Roosevelt won his club championship at 17 , but was struck down by polio . )
You can watch Trump swing on YouTube . There is something about it of the elephant in a tutu trying to exercise a pirouette . He lurches back on a severely flat plane so that he is out of position at the top of his backswing , but then , through some innate athleticism , is able to clear the hips and make a long and effective extension through impact . He is said to have won 19 club championships and to possess a handicap of 2.8 , which is seriously good – and also unlikely .
There have been no signed scorecards submitted since 2014 , and even those that were show several rounds in the mid-80s . Rory McIlroy , following a round with him , would only say he was “ a decent player for a guy in his 70s ” and that he had shot “ around 80 ” . There have been eccentric swings by good players – Jim Furyk 's multiple parts and flying elbow , Eamonn D'Arcy 's helicopter taking off – but they played every day . There would seem to be something wilfully delusional about the 2.8 , like saying he is the leader of the greatest political movement his country has ever seen .
Trump takes pains to remind people how good at golf he is . In February , he interrupted a large meeting of CEOs to ask General Electric 's Jeff Immelt to tell everybody about the hole-in-one he made , immediately after claiming : “ I 'm the best golfer of all the rich people . ”
They all laughed and applauded . Trump took it in . “ It 's crazy , ” he said , shaking his head . Unsolicited , he lists his club championships . He tweets about who he is playing with and who he can beat . All golfers have played with braggarts . It does n't go well . It 's boring , it 's obnoxious . It creates a malodorous air . It 's like bragging about sex . No one wants to hear about it .
Golf is the most existentialist of games . It turns on the same principles – the free act , the assumption of responsibility . Wherever you hit it , you put it there . You must play it as it lies and give an honest account . Without that , you are in bad faith , and the game becomes absurd because you have deprived it of its meaning . “ The man who can go into a patch of rough alone , with the knowledge that only God is watching him , and plays his ball where it lies , is the man who will serve you faithfully and well , ” wrote PG Wodehouse . Trump seems to concur .
“ When you play golf with someone , you learn their honesty , you learn their competitiveness , ” he has said . Several of these playing companions have given reports of the experience . Samuel L Jackson says that Trump cheats . Sports Illustrated 's Mark Mulvoy and the boxer Oscar de la Hoya spoke of balls that had been in shrubs miraculously appearing in the fairway or close to the hole with no strokes added .
The sportswriter Rick Reilly said Trump gave himself not only putts but chip shots and that , on a cheating scale of one to 10 , Trump would be an 11 . When asked who the worst celebrity golf cheat was , Alice Cooper replied : “ I played with Donald Trump one time . That 's all I 'm going to say. ” Trump tends to respond by denigrating the accuser or saying he does n't know them or that he does n't cheat because he 's so good he does n't need to . It 's a serious charge for a golfer . An English club player once bankrupted himself with legal fees trying to sue a fellow member who accused him of cheating .
It 's a strangely self-defeating activity . A hustler might cheat to win a bet , but without a financial motive it 's simply about winning on false pretences . “ Cheating at golf , ” as the late “ Champagne ” Tony Lema said , “ is like cheating at solitaire . You only cheat yourself . ”
What , then , would Putin learn from a round of golf with Trump ? Perhaps that Trump is surprisingly convivial and generous , and that you can have a good time with him . But , if he heard the club championship list , saw balls dropped on to greens or was given phoney scores , he would also see someone of colossal insecurities and needs , who has to bathe in glories of his own invention in order to face the world , like an ageing mascara 'd roué repeating before a mirror : “ Look at me . I am Adonis . ”
Putin may not need the game of golf . He has said that one of the benefits of martial arts is the training it gives in assessing an opponent 's weakness . He may have seen these weaknesses long ago . Waclaw Radziwinowicz , former Moscow correspondent of Poland 's Gazeta Wyborcza , has written that Russia wished for ( and perhaps abetted ) Trump 's victory not so that Trump would be nice to them , but because his unpreparedness , illogicality and emotional instability would make the US weak .
Trump has said that the single most valuable piece of golf advice he had encountered was Ben Hogan 's insistence on the importance of clearing the hips out of the way on the downswing . I had heard this myself . “ Golf is all about getting out of the way , ” a painter and very good golfer once said to me . True in golf , I thought , and in art and life .
But can a man who tweets against his enemies in the middle of the night , who starts each day by reading about himself , who boasts of achievements he has not accomplished , whose consciousness would seem to be so loud and his needs so heavy , ever get sufficiently out of his own way ?
Golf is widely declaimed as elitist . Donald Trump has done his part in making this impression . He builds golf courses for the elite , prosecutes people who stand in their way and expresses his disgust for wind farms that spoil the view from his courses in Scotland .
“ They 're working so hard , ” he has said , “ to make golf a game of the people . They 're cheapening it . I think golf should be a game that people aspire to through success. ” But that 's not how it started . Golf originated on what was then the cheapest land , the dunes by the sea . Sheep were the original greenskeepers . The Duke of York , later James II of England , played a money match against two English noblemen with a poor shoemaker named John Patersone as his partner . Fishwives played in a competition in Musselburgh in 1810 .
Country clubs give golf a bad name just as established churches sometimes do to human spirituality . Golf is , in essence , the most democratic of games . The old and infirm can compete on equal footing with a pro through the handicap system . Public courses , at least in the English-speaking world , make golf affordable to almost anyone .
The postman on a bus with his clubs in Glasgow is equal to Trump as a citizen of the golf world . Even Che Guevara played . I have met a far wider variety of people through golf than through any other activity , including going to pubs . But I have not confined myself to courses with the name Trump in front of them . Perhaps he should get out and about more .

The international future of Pete Samu remained in limbo on Thursday with New Zealand Rugby ( NZR ) yet to decide on the player 's release for Australia 's test series against Ireland next month .
Wallabies coach Michael Cheika omitted Samu from his squad on Wednesday but said pointedly that he wanted to name the loose forward but was prevented from doing so by matters “ out of his hands ” .
Melbourne-born Samu , who will join the Canberra-based ACT Brumbies in Super Rugby next season , is contracted to the reigning champion Canterbury Crusaders and also New Zealand 's Tasman provincial side .
“ There 's no decision , ” an NZR spokesperson said on Thursday . “ We still are considering a request from Rugby Australia , but have made no decision yet . ”
Meanwhile , the 26-year-old 's Super Rugby coach Scott Robertson said he was pleased that Samu was in Cheika 's plans and would abide with whatever was worked out between the two governing bodies .
“ We 'll support New Zealand Rugby 's decision , ” Crusaders coach Robertson told reporters in Christchurch on Thursday . “ He is going to be a Wallaby at some stage is n't he ? If it is in June , and they decide it , then great - good on him .
“ He 's an Australian who wants to play for Australia , he is good enough to be a Wallaby so we will see when that occurs . ”
Robertson added that Samu 's decision to move to the Brumbies would not count against him in the Christchurch-based side 's remaining Super Rugby fixtures .
“ He 's contracted to the Crusaders - if he plays well enough he 'll play , ” Robertson added . “ I would n't say it is an issue at all and the way we handle it is like we would with any other contract . It is the nature of the sport . ”
Players selected for national teams have to be released for international duty according to World Rugby rules , however , the global governing body has an exception for those eligible for multiple countries .
Under Regulation 9.38 , players who are contracted to a country they are eligible for can be restricted from appearing for a second country .
Samu first played for Tasman when he was 22 and could have been selected for the All Blacks on residency grounds , but was overlooked by coach Steve Hansen for the June series against France .
The tug-of-war echoes the recent public battle over England 's selection of Wellington Hurricanes captain Brad Shields for their series against South Africa .
Shields had signed with English club Wasps at the conclusion of Super Rugby , but NZR initially baulked at releasing him while he was still contracted to a New Zealand team .
The governing body later granted Shields a temporary release from his Hurricanes contract because he had been “ an exceptional leader . . . and a loyal servant to New Zealand Rugby . ”

A drug-driver who was involved in a crash on the M1 was unable to stand up when highways officer arrived .
Police then found he could not drive in a straight line .
Cameron Gutherie , 19 , of Sutton Road , Church Broughton , was involved in the collision with another vehicle on the southbound carriageway of the M1 motorway , near Tibshelf services .
Highway officers attended the scene and advised the drivers off both cars , who were uninjured , to travel to the services to get them off the motorway and exchange details .
But Lynn Bickley , prosecuting , said : `` Mr Gutherie appeared to be unable to drive in a straight line and highways officers noticed the Vauxhall Corsa he was driving mount a kerb and stall . There was a wheel-spin and then the car sped off in the direction of the car park .
( Image : Google Maps )
“ He appeared unable to stand up and was advised to remain seated in his car while the police were called . The defendant appeared to fall asleep and remained like that until police arrived at 7.50am . ”
Mrs Bickley added that police had to wake Gutherie and they felt that he appeared intoxicated or under the influence of drugs .
The teenager completed a road-side drink-drive test which was negative but traces of a drug were found in his system after a blood test .
Mrs Bickley confirmed that the drug Alprazolam - which is used to treat anxiety - was found in Gutherie 's system . This can have side effects including drowsiness and nausea .
The business management student pleaded guilty to driving a vehicle while unfit to drive through drugs after the incident on October 22 at Chesterfield magistrates ' court .
Defence solicitor Paul McLeod said the defendant has a history of depression and he had been to a party . He was feeling down and his friends had advised him to leave and had given him a tablet to make him feel better .
Magistrates fined Gutherie £120 and ordered him to pay £85 costs and a £30 victim surcharge .
He was also banned from driving for 12 months .

KaIra To Separate Ways Again
In the upcoming episode , Kartik and Naira finally come face to face . Their past memories flash in front of them . Both of them get emotional . Yet again , they decide to separate ways !
Naira Does n't Want To Go Back To The College
Kartik heads back to Udaipur , while Naira returns home upset . She will be seen angry at herself . She does n't want to go back to the college and shreds her ID card into pieces .
Naitik Confused
Seeing her in this state , Naitik gets confused ! Naira will not even tell her father about having come face to face with Kartik , as she does n't want her father to get worried .

The overarching trend of the past few years has been that the manual transmission is on the way out . People like automatics , they can be faster than manually shifting , and they 're frequently better at saving fuel . But there 's still a sizable enough minority of manual fans and buyers that automakers continue to offer a manual in nooks and crannies of the automotive market . And you might be surprised at some of the offerings . We certainly were , so we thought we 'd compile a list of cars with an available manual , to narrow the options for those of you who absolutely must have three pedals.There are a number of surprises on this list . For instance , Jeep has quite a range of manuals . They 're available on the Compass and Patriot , and amazingly , they can be coupled to four-wheel-drive and trim levels that are n't completely basic . A weird omission we found was the Mini Cooper Countryman . Every version of it is available with a manual , except the front-wheel-drive version of the Cooper S variant , and ( less surprisingly ) the PHEV . Then again , BMW seems to be very particular about which vehicles get manuals and which do n't , applying many arbitrary restrictions . Likewise , Nissan and Toyota with their cab and transmission configurations for the Frontier and Tacoma . Check out the full list below .
Activision in April announced the next installment in the long-running Call of Duty franchise . A reveal trailer followed shortly after along with word that anyone who pre-ordered the game would get access to a private beta ahead of a November 3 launch .
For those that went ahead and plunked down the cash to reserve the game , its nearly time to redeem your perk .
Developer Sledgehammer Games on Monday revealed that the private multiplayer beta will commence late next week  August 25 , to be exact  on PlayStation 4 .
The beta will offer at least three multiplayer maps including Ardennes , Pointe Du Hoc and Gibraltar as well as familiar gameplay modes like team deathmatch , domination and hardpoint . Also on display will be WWIIs new War gameplay mode .
Developed in partnership with Raven Software , War is described as a new way to play CoD multiplayer in an immersive Allied vs. Axis fight across the war-torn village of St . Lo , France.
Gamers will also get to experience Divisions , the new class creation platform thats replacing the Pick 10 Create-a-Class system . In the beta , players can experiment with the Infantry , Expeditionary , Airborne , Armored and Mountain Division . Naturally , youre encouraged to try them all .
Interestingly enough , Sledgehammer Games also provided a list of what not to expect in the beta :
Headquarters  Were testing the match-making of this all-new social experience , but access to this space will not be active during the Multiplayer Beta .
Supply Drops , and Loot  These customization features that add depth and personality to your soldier will not be included in the Multiplayer Beta .
Esports  Ranked Play , Game Battles , and our suite of competitive features will be accessible when we release in November .
Additional content not in the Private Multiplayer Beta includes : full progression , remaining maps and modes , additional War Mode maps , and the full armory of weapons , scorestreaks , Basic Training , and equipment .
Sledgehammer Games said user feedback will help them finalize features , optimize gameplay balance and refine the remaining development roadmap ahead of launch .
A judge on Monday appointed an attorney for James Alex Fields Jr. , the man suspected of killing a woman as he allegedly mowed down a group of counterprotesters at a white supremacist rally here .
Fields , 20 , is accused of driving his car into a crowd of people , killing Heather Heyer , a 32-year-old paralegal , who was protesting the `` Unite the Right '' march on Saturday .
Fields is being held on suspicion of second-degree murder , malicious wounding and failure to stop in an accident that resulted in death .
Fields was also denied bail by a judge , the Associated Press reports .
The suspect appeared via videolink in front of Judge Robert Downer wearing a black and white jumpsuit and was informed of his charges and rights .
Bond was not set and the judge appointed attorney Charles Weber .
Downer set August 25 as the date for the next hearing , but it is possible there will be a bond hearing before then .
The incident took place as hundreds of white nationalists converged on Charlottesville to protest the removal of a statue of Confederate general and slavery advocate Robert E. Lee .
Nineteen people were injured during clashes , 10 of whom were listed Sunday in good condition by the University of Virginia Health System . Nine patients were released .
Two Virginia State Police troopers died when a helicopter crashed in a wooded area near Charlottesville after monitoring Saturday 's events .
The clashes in Charlottesville sparked political fallout over the weekend , with critics blasting President Donald Trump for failing to single out white supremacists in his criticism of the violence . The Vice President , however , on Sunday did just that , calling out `` dangerous fringe groups . ''
People around the nation marched Sunday in support of the anti-racism protesters in Charlottesville , with more than 130 rallies from California to Maine .
What do we know about Fields ?
Fields was a man who possessed `` outlandish , very radical beliefs , '' and a `` fondness '' for Adolf Hitler , according to Derek Weimer , who teaches social studies at Randall K. Cooper High School in Union , Kentucky .
`` It was quite clear he had some really extreme views and maybe a little bit of anger behind them , '' Weimer told CNN . `` Feeling , what 's the word I 'm looking for , oppressed or persecuted . He really bought into this white supremacist thing . He was very big into Nazism . He really had a fondness for Adolf Hitler . ''
Principal Mike Wilson said he remembered Fields as a quiet and reserved student who graduated in 2015 . In August of that year , Fields was inducted into the Army but he left active duty in December 2015 . A spokeswoman for the Army said he failed to meet training standards .
`` As a result he was never awarded a military occupational skill nor was he assigned to a unit outside of basic training , '' Lt. Col. Jennifer Johnson said .
Fields ' mother , Samantha Bloom , told the Toledo Blade in Ohio , where he lives , that she did n't know her son was going to Virginia for a white nationalist rally . She thought it had something to do with Trump .
She told the Blade she did n't discuss politics with her son . She was surprised her son attended an event with white supremacists .
`` He had an African-American friend , '' she told the Blade .
Pence decries neo-Nazis , 'dangerous fringe groups '
As criticism of Trump 's response reverberated , Vice President Mike Pence condemned the violence and white supremacists .
`` We have no tolerance for hate and violence from white supremacists , neo-Nazis or the KKK , '' Pence said during a trip to Cartagena , Colombia . `` These dangerous fringe groups have no place in American public life and in the American debate and we condemn them in the strongest possible terms . ''
Pence added : `` The President also made clear that behavior by others of different militant perspectives are also unacceptable in our political debate and discourse . ''
The creator of one of the most prolific neo-Nazi websites praised Trump for not specifically blaming neo-Nazis and white supremacists , saying `` he loves us . ''
Andrew Anglin of the Daily Stormer wrote that Trump 's comments were `` good . ''
`` He did n't attack us . He just said the nation should come together . Nothing specific against us . He said that we need to study why people are so angry , and implied that there was hate on ... both sides ! '' Anglin wrote . `` There was virtually no counter-signaling of us at all . He loves us all . ''
Anglin did not respond to CNN 's request for comment .
What happens now ?
Three other men were arrested Saturday . One faces a charge of carrying a concealed handgun and another is charged with disorderly conduct . The third man was arrested on suspicion of assault and battery .
The Justice Department and the Federal Bureau of Investigation have launched a civil rights investigation into the deadly crash , to be led by US Attorney Rick Mountcastle .
Investigators will be looking into Fields ' alleged motives , and whether there 's enough evidence for a domestic terrorism case .

MEMPHIS , Tenn. — Police are looking for a group of more than a dozen people who they say tried to smoke marijuana inside a popular restaurant , then skipped out on a $ 420 bill .
It happened at Frida 's Mexican Restaurante on Madison avenue in Memphis , Tennessee this past Sunday night .
Surveillance video from inside the restaurant shows a table of 16 people eating and enjoying themselves .

Frida 's manager Jesse Gonzalez told WREG they were one of the last tables seated at around 10:30 p.m. , a half hour before closing .
`` They came in at the last minute , '' Gonzalez said . `` We did n't think anything of it . ”
He said they treated themselves , ordering some of the most expensive things on the menu , including $ 11 margaritas .
`` The grand burritos , Frida 's special steak , steak and shrimp , ” he said .
But soon , he said , the bartender got a whiff of something that did n't smell like grilled steak and peppers .
`` It was just one guy smoking weed . We asked him to stop . I guess he was the leader or the group and he made a scene , ” Gonzalez said .
At that point , Gonzalez said , the group started berating the staff .
`` They started getting louder and louder , getting upset , yelling offenses to the server , saying come on , come on . ''
Eventually , one by one , the people finished their drinks and left the table .
Two women left behind did n't seem to be in as much of a hurry , though . One even carried her blue margarita away from the table after the group ignored staff and skipped out on the $ 420 bill .
Gonzalez says they even pushed one of the servers in the stairwell . He says he 's never seen anything like it .
`` Our walkouts are ( usually because ) they forgot to pay or they 'll come back next day . Major walkouts like that , that 's our first and biggest one . ''
Gonzalez said he thinks they planned the whole outburst so they could skip out on the bill .
`` You do n't think they 're gon na do that , especially on a Sunday night , '' he said . `` One guy got them all riled up at the same time . ''
Gonzalez said he 's not too worried about the money . He 's glad all his workers are unhurt , but he said he also hopes police catch the people responsible .

Swift spoke to Rolling Stone about Petty 's tremendous influence on her .
“ To me , Tom Petty represented a kind of songwriting I idolized : complex simplicity , ” she revealed . “ It said so much in the lyrics , the concepts , the stories , the message , the nuances … but always brought you back to a hook that got stuck in everyone 's head . He motivated thousands of guitarists to learn to play just because they wanted to be able to play ‘ Free Fallin. ” Count me as one of them . ”
Swift famously covered Petty 's timeless 1977 single , “ American Girl , ” releasing it as a single and performing it on her Fearless tour in 2009 . Check it out below .

WARNING : The following video contains animal cruelty and may be disturbing to some viewers , please use discretion before continuing .
A California teen is facing a felony animal cruelty charge and heavy online criticism following a video that surfaced showing him throwing a kitten into a body of water .
18-year-old Garratt Haile , a high school senior from Patterson , California was arrested February 2 after the video began going viral . The footage is thought to have been filmed about a year ago .
In the 11-second clip , a person recording the shocking event can be heard saying , “ Welcome to badass , and this is Felipe the flying cat. ” Haile can then be seen lifting the cat by the scruff of its neck before hurling it into what appears to be a lake .
Patterson Police stated in a press release that the video was “ posted in a private Facebook group page for local residents . ”
“ During the overnight hours , deputies continued their investigation and were able to identify the subject as 18-year old Garratt Haile of Patterson , ” the release stated . “ Deputies were able to contact Garratt at his residence and interview him . Garratt was arrested this morning at about 8:00 AM and booked into the Stanislaus County Jail for felony animal cruelty . It is believed this incident occurred several months ago and that several other subjects were with Garratt at the time the video was recorded . Detectives are still investigating this incident to identify other subjects and the location where the incident took place . ”
Authorities attributed social media to being able to apprehend the suspect .
“ This is an excellent example of the public 's cooperation and we certainly appreciate it , ” said Patterson Police Services Chief Jeff Dirkse . “ With calls we received and the information shared to us via social media , we were able to quickly investigate , identify , and make an arrest in this case . ”
Nicole Pinheiro posted the video to a community page in hopes that Haile would be caught . She told Heavy :
The video I posted I screen recorded ( it 's a feature that the iPhone has ) because people were wondering how to share it . So I recorded and shared it with the news stations because I felt it something that needed to be seen , so he can pay for actions . Which that is exactly what happened . He got caught . Everyone on the watch page was tagging the local police department and even calling them . So he would have been caught regardless . But sometimes things like this get looked over ( not by purpose ) but they do . So I shared it with the local news stations and they all wrote me back . Saying ‘ thanks for the tip , we are looking into this . ' Then in the morning at 8 a.m. he was arrested . Then the new stations picked up the story and it went from there . I am just glad he got caught and he is being charged . I do n't care if they are charging him as a minor or an adult . I 'm just glad that he is getting punished for what he did . I want him to realize what he did was completely wrong . Which I 'm sure he is feeling it now .
The condition of the kitten is not known at this time , however this article will be updated as information becomes available .
“ I just want to know if the kitten is okay , ” Pinheiro stated . “ It has not been said whether the cat is okay or not . ”
If the incident did indeed occur approximately one year ago , the timing eerily aligns with the timing of another California teen who was under fire after throwing a cat onto pavement :
The feline in the coverage above miraculously survived , and a 16-year-old was taken into custody in Ontario , located about 330 miles from Patterson .
“ The Suspect in the Cat Abuse Video has been ARRESTED ! , ” Ontario Police exclaimed in a tweet . “ He was spotted by officers today in Upland . He ran from the officers but was quickly tackled and arrested . The injured cat is at a veterinarian hospital being looked after and is in good condition . ”
In the absolutely disturbing 10-second clip , it sounds as if a bystander says “ Ca n't believe you 're doing this , ” before the boy hurls the kitten through the air . When it lands on the street , the feline can be heard crying in apparent and expected pain after hitting the pavement .

NEW YORK - Worried about catching a cold or the flu on an airplane ? Get a window seat , and do n't leave it until the flight is over .
That 's what some experts have been saying for years , and it 's perhaps the best advice coming out of a new attempt to determine the risks of catching germs on an airplane .
The new study sent squads of researchers onto commercial flights to look for viruses and observe how and when people came into close contact .
They concluded that people on the aisles get up the most and tend to be most likely to be near a person spewing infectious droplets of flu or cold virus . The study was funded by Boeing , the Chicago-based airplane manufacturer . It was published Monday by the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .

Sexual health is defined by Mosby 's Medical Dictionary as “ a capacity to enjoy and control sexual behavior without fear , shame or guilt. ” Sexual dysfunction is broadly defined by the Gale Encyclopedia of Medicine as “ disorders that interfere with a full sexual response cycle . These disorders make it difficult for a person to enjoy or to have sexual intercourse . ”
The good news , especially for older adults , is that most sexual dysfunctions can be treated or alleviated through exercise . It has been found to increase sexual drive , functioning , activity and satisfaction because of the physical endurance , muscle tone and body composition derived from exercise . In addition , exercise activates the sympathetic nervous system , which encourages blood flow to the genital regions .
Even low levels of physical activity can elevate mood and help keep sex organs and muscles in better working condition . A 2000 study found that after just 20 minutes of vigorous exercise , women became more sexually responsive , while men had increased testosterone levels after short , intense bouts of exercise .
Frequency , level of desire and enjoyment are also affected positively for those who engage in regular exercise at any age . In 2004 , a study of college-age students found a strong correlation between fitness levels , self-perception , body image , social meaning , outward appearance , and sexual performance and desire . These findings were replicated in studies of people in their 40s and 60s . And of course , sexual activity itself counts as exercise !
One really interesting comparison of exercise and sexual activity looked at heart rate and blood pressure during treadmill exercise and sexual activity ( not simultaneously ) . Not surprisingly , participants spent more time in sexual activity than they did on the treadmill , but here 's the intriguing point — the treadmill exercise duration predicted sexual activity duration . For each minute of treadmill time , there was a 2.3-minute increase in sexual activity duration .
There are also a number of sexual diseases and dysfunctions that are radically improved through exercise . For example , exercise has a protective effect on Type 2 diabetes , with pelvic floor exercises of specific value . A minimum of about 50 percent of overweight men with Type 2 diabetes have erectile dysfunction , a frustrating condition that is helped enormously by cardiorespiratory fitness .
Urinary incontinence is markedly improved via pelvic floor muscle training , with 100 percent of women reporting decreased incontinence frequency and duration . And it works for men , too — after the strengthening training , incidences of urinary and fecal incontinence decreased and erectile function increased . Pelvic floor exercises are also an effective modality for primiparous ( giving birth only once ) women who have vaginal deliveries . Desire and satisfaction go up , and pain goes down for these women .
Breast cancer survivors consistently report an improved quality of life ( better physical functioning , reduced fatigue and pain ) when they participate in physical activity . In addition , prostate and bladder cancer are positively affected by exercise , including its stress-reducing aspects .
Sexual activity itself has been found to help with cardiovascular disease , with researchers finding that sexual activity corresponds to light to moderate physical exercise and entails no significant risk to the majority of patients with cardiovascular disease ( severe angina or chronic heart failure are exceptions ) .
There has been a lot of research on the relationship between exercise and erectile dysfunction , which affects more than 100 million men . The link between cardiovascular disease , metabolic syndrome and erectile dysfunction is strong , and exercise is a mitigating factor on all three . Doctors who prescribe movement to patients with these three issues have reported high success rates . This is good news , especially considering that exercise is a less invasive treatment than medications , surgery or testosterone replacement therapies .
Sexual functioning and health are things everyone should have at any age . Exercise just may be the magic pill !
[ Note : The authors recognize that it would be far too easy to make jokes about sexual health , but decided to play it straight for today 's column . ]

Asylum seekers are being forced to wait an average of two years for a decision on their protection applications despite recommendations that the process be completed within 12 months , the UN Refugee Agency ( UNHCR ) has warned .
Retired High Court judge Bryan McMahon recommended in June 2015 that newly arrived asylum seekers receive a decision on their application within 12 months and that they be given the right to work after nine months . Nearly three years later , asylum seekers are waiting an average of 19 months for an interview at the Department of Justice , with the final decision likely to result in further delays .
On February 9th of this year the Supreme Court ruled the ban on asylum seekers ' right to work was unconstitutional , meaning people awaiting a decision on their application could legally apply for jobs in Ireland . However , the restrictions within the right to work scheme proposed by Government means accessing the employment market for most asylum seekers is near impossible .
Speaking at University College Cork 's School of Law on Tuesday , head of UNHCR Ireland Enda O'Neill warned that leaving people for long periods in direct provision without access to employment was resulting in “ dependency and disempowerment ” and “ hampering their integration prospects ” .
Mr O'Neill noted that under European law , decisions on asylum applications should be made “ in normal circumstances within six months ” .
“ Each year one person spends in direct provision costs the state €10,950 ” said O'Neill , referring to figures in the 2015 McMahon Working Group report . “ The cost of processing is a fraction of this amount . Investing in decision making not only improves outcomes for refugees , but also makes financial sense . ”
Fiona Finn from the Immigrant Support Centre ( Nasc ) in Cork warned that few changes had been implemented since the findings of the McMahon report . “ It is essential that we look beyond direct provision and start to imagine what a truly respectful and humane protection and reception system could look like . This conference is a critical first step in that process . ”
There were 5,318 people living in the 34 direct provision centres across Ireland at the end of March 2018 .
Some 993 applications for asylum have been received by the Department of Justice so far this year . A total of 2,927 applications were made in 2017 , significantly lower than the peak in 2002 when 11,634 were made .
`` They 're going to be choosing a person to lead them who will be in some very tricky , very delicate negotiations with U.S. officials , '' Wynne said . `` That 's the reality of the role premier ( and ) we can not let ideology get in our way . ''
For her part , Horwath shrugged off Liberal accusations Wednesday that her NDP is too beholden to union interests . She rejected a Liberal allegation that her party has a questionable financial relationship with a group of unions known as Cornerstone — a for-profit group founded by eight unions . The Liberals allege the group has been financially supporting the New Democrat election campaign and operations .
The NDP has no financial relationship with Cornerstone , Horwath said at a campaign stop in Windsor , Ont . The governing Liberals , she added , have consistently made deals with special interest groups throughout their years in office .
`` This is a government , a party , that spent its time cutting deals with various interest groups to try to help them politically . So , I completely dismiss any accusations from Ms. Wynne on that file , '' Horwath said .
Meanwhile , the Tories , who have repeatedly come under fire for not yet releasing a costed platform , quietly updated their website Wednesday to show a more detailed compilation of the campaign promises they have made so far .
Ford has pledged to present a costed plan before the election but has not specified when he will do so . His spokeswoman , Melissa Lantsman , would not say whether the updated plan posted by the party constitutes its platform .
`` The plan for the people of Ontario is all there – as we 've said all along we 've been making announcements on our plan everyday , this is the compilation of all of them in one place , '' she said in an email .
Ontario heads to the polls June 7 .

The Rangers have put added emphasis on developing pitching in the last year , but they also have a system deep in young position players , which allowed them to spend more on pitching . Scouting director Kip Fagg said the team did n't need to draft as many roster-filler position players .
The Rangers finished off the three-day amateur draft Wednesday by taking 23 pitchers among their final picks in the 40-round draft . In all , the Rangers took 29 pitchers and just 12 position players .
`` It was a tough draft to get bats , but there were a lot of good arms , '' scouting director Kipp Fagg said . `` We like the guys we took , but it 's not like we went into it just looking for pitching . ''
And all the pitchers the Rangers selected will do only that . Fagg said the team took no players with the idea of having them both pitch and play a position , though the organization had given it significant discussion .
Among some of the more interesting pitching prospects selected on Day 3 :
-- Right-hander Blaine Knight of Arkansas : A third-year sophomore , he was projected to go in the first 10 rounds , but may have fallen due to indications he planned to go back to school unless he received a top tier bonus .
-- Right-hander Daniel Robert of Auburn : Primarily an outfielder in college , Robert will move to the mound only as a pro .
`` He 's very intriguing as a pitcher , '' Fagg said . `` He understands his future is as a pitcher . ''
The Rangers began the day by selecting athletic infielder Obie Ricumstrict from Mt . Pleasant ( Mich. ) H.S .. He has committed to the University of Cincinnati , but Fagg said he expects Ricumstrict will sign .
For players selected in rounds 11-40 , there is a $ 100,000 cap on signing bonuses , though teams may use any remaining money they have from their pool for top 10 picks to incentivize offers . The signing deadline is July 7 .
Briefly
-- With INF Jurickson Profar on the roster , perhaps only for another day or two , the Rangers used the opportunity to give SS Elvis Andrus his second night off this season . When RHP Tyson Ross is activated Friday , the Rangers will have to make a roster move and may not have the luxury of keeping multiple middle infielders .
-- DH-1B Mike Napoli ( back ) will begin a rehab assignment at Double-A Frisco on Thursday . Manager Jeff Banister said it 's possible Napoli could rejoin the Rangers this weekend .
-- The Rangers dedicated the selection of 34th round pick RHP Edmond Americaan from Chipola ( Fla. ) JC to the memory of scout Jose Felomina . American played for Felomina in Curacao as a 13- and 14-year-old . Felomina passed away in February after a battle with cancer .

Radicalisation is a word we have frequently heard over the last few years , but what does it actually mean ?
The Government , in the Counterterrorism and Security Act ( 2015 ) ( CTSA ) defined it as ‘ the process by which a person comes to support terrorism , and extremist ideologies associated with terrorist groups ' .
Radicalisation does not just mean those committing terrorist acts in the name of groups like ISIS .
It can also mean those breaking the law on behalf of white supremacists , animal rights groups , Islamophobia , or anti-Semitism , to name a few .
The CTSA says we need to have ‘ due regard ' to the need to prevent children and adults being drawn into terrorism .
Vulnerability is a key factor behind why children and adults may get drawn into radicalisation .
Signs and possible indicators of suspected radicalisation include extremist influences , personal circumstances , feeling aggrieved with society , religious conversion , a change in style of dress or speech , global or national political events , attending meetings , having ‘ new ' friends and possession of extremist literature .
Prevention is better than cure , so stay calm , and talk to your child about how things are , what you have noticed and ask if they have any worries ?
Each local authority has a Channel 39 panel , for those at risk of being drawn into extremism , which can be contacted by individuals .
This panel is run by the police .
Training and education can also help , so you know how to tackle this tricky topic .
Children and adults who feel removed from those around them , isolated , not listened to , confused and angry are a prime target for being radicalised .
The results can be tragic – notice it .

PacWest Bancorp in Los Angeles is getting out of general cash flow lending .
The $ 25 billion-asset company said in a press release Monday that it will sell about $ 1.5 billion in health care , technology and other cash flow loans to Morgan Stanley Bank for a pretax gain of roughly $ 13 million .
PacWest said it also plans to sell a portfolio of performing technology cash flow loans with an aggregate principal balance of $ 152 million in a separate transaction .
The sales are expected to close by the end of this year .
The company said it plans to keep expanding is security cash flow business .
PacWest said it will consider ways to redeploy the liquidity from the loan sale , adding that it will likely reduce its balance of wholesale deposits and potentially repurchase more of its common stock .
The sale “ allows management to focus attention and resources on profitably growing our other businesses , ” Matt Wagner , PacWest 's president and CEO , said in the release . He added that the move should lower the company 's credit risk profile , decrease earnings volatility and significantly mitigate headwinds from incrementally shrinking the cash flow portfolio .
PacWest will retain nine non-security-related cash flow lending relationships with a total carrying value of $ 100 million . About $ 39 million of the loans are classified ; PacWest has established reserves that represent about half of the loans ' aggregate legal balance .

SAN FRANCISCO , CA -- ( Marketwired - October 06 , 2017 ) - Japan and the United States are hotspots for companies that are looking to license-out exciting regenerative medicine technology , says Colin Lee Novick , managing director of CJ PARTNERS . In this interview with The Life Sciences Report , Novick discusses a regenerative medicine company pursuing partnerships in Japan for its cell therapies to treat chronic tendinosis , damaged or aged skin , and pattern baldness .
Included in this interview is : RepliCel Life Sciences Inc. ( TSX VENTURE : RP ) ( OTCQB : REPCF )
The Life Sciences Report : Colin , would you bring us up to date on RepliCel Life Sciences Inc. 's trials ?
Colin Lee Novick : From a biotech company 's point of view , one of the important things is successfully meeting clinical trial endpoints . But from a biotech investor 's point of view , what 's oftentimes really important are the answers to the questions : When are you going to have your partner and where are you going to have that exit ?
Both these questions were top-of-mind for RepliCel and its investors this year . Firstly , RepliCel successfully finished the clinical trials for RCS-01 and RCT-01 , for tendon regeneration and skin rejuvenation , respectively . What followed is that these have fueled discussions with potential partners .
For instance , RepliCel had one clinical trial , Phase 1/2a , for tendon repair in chronic Achilles tendinosis on the RCT-01 , a randomized 3:1 , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial at the University of British Columbia Sports Medicine Clinic with eight participants . As for final results , the trial met its goal and established a complete safety profile at six months that showed no serious adverse events related to the study treatment or injection procedure . Usually , with the injection , you 're going to get some mild irritation , but that 's not a large safety issue . It allows RepliCel to proceed to the next stage .

Merck CEO Kenneth Frazier is leaving President Trump 's American Manufacturing Council , saying , `` I feel a responsibility to take a stand against intolerance and extremism . ''
The resignation came after Trump was criticized for his response to the violence at white supremacist events in Charlottesville , Va. , over the weekend . The president , famous for his ability to be direct and forceful , was faulted for condemning violence `` on many sides . ''
Within an hour of Merck announcing Frazier 's withdrawal , Trump retorted on Twitter , `` Now that Ken Frazier of Merck Pharma has resigned ... he will have more time to lower ripoff drug prices ! ''
In a statement on his resignation , Frazier said , `` America 's leaders must honor our fundamental values by clearly rejecting expressions of hatred , bigotry and group supremacy , which run counter to the American ideal that all people are created equal . ''
Frazier , who is African-American , said he was acting as both the CEO of Merck and `` as a matter of personal conscience . ''
The rift did not seem to harm Merck 's stock : The drug company 's shares rose by nearly a full percentage point in the first hour of trading , to nearly $ 63 .
Members of his own party have called on Trump to condemn Saturday 's killing of a woman who had been protesting white supremacists as an act of domestic terrorism . The White House later stated that Trump was including `` white supremacists , KKK Neo-Nazi and all extremist groups '' in his remarks about the violence .
Frazier 's departure is the latest high-profile exit from a White House advisory council since Trump took office in January .
After Trump announced in June that the U.S. would be leaving the Paris climate accord , both Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Disney CEO Bob Iger left his business advisory council .
Months earlier , in February , Uber co-founder Travis Kalanick left the same panel during the fallout from Trump 's executive order that banned immigrants from seven Muslim countries .
`` The executive order is hurting many people in communities all across America , '' Kalanick said at the time .

Hospital bosses have admitted that the next few weeks `` will be messy '' following the Burton and Derby trusts merger - with 55 senior members of staff yet to learn their future .
The University Hospitals of Derby and Burton NHS Foundation Trust launched on Sunday , July 1 following two years of planning to bring together the trusts in charge of five hospitals , including Queen 's Hospital , in Burton .
But newly appointed chief executive of the combined trust Gavin Boyle said the future of tier three staff members - including general managers , clinical directors , matrons and lead nurses - would be decided over the next six to eight weeks .
He said : `` Ideally we would have had all the appointments in place before the starting point but we did make a conscious decision , because of the uncertainty about whether it was going to happen , to not go through tier three , as it involves a lot of people , if we were n't sure it was going to happen .
`` We did hold back , now we 've got six to eight weeks where it might be a little bit messy . I think what we ought to do is acknowledge that and make sure everybody knows . ''
Hospital bosses hope that the move will see Burton remain a vibrant district hospital , with services in Derby sustained and specialised services developed , patient choice retained and extra services introduced to the community hospitals .
Burton Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust , which runs Queen 's Hospital , along with two community hospitals , in Lichfield and Tamworth , has now merged with Derby Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust , which controls the Royal Derby Hospital , and a community hospital in London Road , Derby .
Before the move could be confirmed , a patients ' benefits case was produced and presented to two regulators to assess , with approval needed from both for the move to go ahead .
The two regulators were NHS Improvement , the health body 's regulator and the competition and markets authority ( CMA ) .
In March , the CMA confirmed that its investigations found the merger would be 'compelling ' , beneficial and outweighed any concerns about competition between the two trusts .
The CMA concluded that despite some concerns that patients might have less choice for some services , potentially reducing the trusts ' incentives to maintain or improve quality in these services , this was outweighed by the expected benefits overall .
NHS Improvement submitted its own reply to the case of its independent view on the move .
This was considered by the provider regulatory committee of NHS Improvement , a senior group which looks at major plans including mergers and acquisitions .
They do not offer approval , but instead award the move a risk assessment rating , which the councils of governors of both trusts took into consideration in advance of a final decision .
However , as uncertainty remained whether the move would go through on July 1 , certain appointments and decisions were not made .
Mr Boyle added : `` There are fantastic people that work in this trust and there 's something about trusting in your own judgement .
`` Everybody is working with good intentions , I think we should give ourselves some slack and just accept that we are going through the transition period . ''
Tier three staff members refers to around 55 members of staff who are general managers , clinical directors , matrons and lead nurses . Many of these roles are yet to be decided .
Meanwhile tier one and two appointments have been made , concerning executive directors , divisional directors , divisional nursing directors and associate directors .
Magnus Harrison , the former medical director of the Burton trust , has been handed the same role in the combined trust .
He spoke of his ambition to transform the trust into one that is `` outstanding . ''
Mr Harrison said : `` The seismic shift of taking on another 550,000 people ( from the Derby Trust population area ) did n't really impact on me at all , I did n't notice , which is exactly the way it should be .
`` Purely from a Burton perspective we were in special measures and I think this is part of that journey now .
`` We had an executive team that made all of the decisions and we 're slowly devolving that decision-making through to clinical teams to people who actually know how those clinical services should be delivered .
`` The next phase is about saying we 've gone so far and to take the next step .
`` 'Requires improvement ' is not something that sits easily with me from a CQC rating , so I want us to be 'good ' at the next CQC visit , then the aspiration will be to be recognised as the only trust in the Midlands and East to be 'outstanding ' .
`` What we need is everyone on board , my role as an executive and the executive team is to create an environment where everyone can do good things . ''
History of the Burton and Derby hospital trusts merger
Planning documents for the proposed merger were submitted at the end of 2017 .
Earlier , in June 2017 , it was announced at a Healthwatch meeting that the outline business case for the partnership of the organisations , with a recommendation to merge , was approved .
Fears have been raised by many , particularly in Burton , that the hospital could lose services , including the accident and emergency department , but officials insisted that this is not the case .
The Burton Mail , as well as the town 's MP Andrew Griffiths , joined the fight to keep it open .
At the Healthwatch meeting it was confirmed by bosses from both respective trusts , Helen Scott-South from Burton and Gavin Boyle from Derby , that the A & E department would not close .
A new trust has been formed , under a new combined title , 'University Hospitals of Derby and Burton NHS Foundation Trust ' .
The chairman will be John Rivers , the current chairman of both Derby and Burton trusts , and chief executive of Derby Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust Gavin Boyle , will take up the same role at the new trust .
Hospital bosses have previously revealed that Burton 's Queen 's Hospital could save almost £10 million next year if the merger goes ahead .
In March , 2018 , the Competition and Markets Authority gave the move a green light , after ruling that benefits of the merger outweighed potential competition concerns .
On Sunday , July 1 the two trusts merged , forming the University Hospitals of Derby and Burton NHS Foundation Trust .
Just what company may have development rights to the 1,048-acre Naples property will go before the Santa Barbara County Supervisors on Tuesday , who have allotted two hours of their regular meeting to the issue .
The project , known as Santa Barbara Ranch , located both north and south of Highway 101 , was approved by the supervisors in 2008 .
Two separate development agreements were included in those approvals , one for the inland portion of the project and for the coastal portion , which was rescinded by supervisors in 2009 . The inland agreement remains active .
A string of developers have attempted to move the project forward , the most recent being Missouri-based company SBHRC Inc .
However , that company asked county supervisors in June to consent to a transfer agreement to a new company , Spectra America . If all moves forward , Spectra would assume the rights to develop the inland portion of the property .
The county can refuse to give consent if it does n't think the transferee can uphold the financial obligation , which is exactly one option staff are putting before supervisors this week .
“ Spectra America has not submitted any information to date regarding their reputation and financial resources , ” according to the county 's staff report .
The developer is required to pay $ 100,000 to a nonprofit conservation organization for creek restoration in the area within 60 days of the agreement becoming effective , according to the agreement . It also must pay $ 300,000 to the nonprofit to implement that creek restoration plan before construction or grading begins , and offer all reasonable assistance to implement the plan within three years .
Both companies submitted paperwork waving the 45-day period for the county to consider the transfer agreement to Aug. 20 . Spectrum has also confirmed that escrow will not close on the property prior to the conclusion of the board 's hearing on Aug. 20 .
Staff is recommending that the board either continue the hearing until Aug. 20 , or tell the company it wo n't consent to the transfer because the company has n't provided evidence of the its reputation or financial resources to perform the obligation in the development agreement .
If Spectra does provide the documentation , however , the county could reconsider .
Attorney Marc Chytilo , who is representing the Naples Coalition , a group dedicated to opposing development in the area , said Monday that he 'll be urging the board to deny the request for the transfer agreement .
If the company does resubmit , it should submit information on its financial condition and reputation at the time of the request , he said .
“ Since the county only has 45 days to review the information , it must be made available concurrently with the request so the public and decision makers have time to review it and ask questions , ” he said . “ The proposal to extend the deadline to the date of the next board hearing paints the county into a corner with no room to themselves ask for more information . The last time this was before the board , the supervisors found they did not have adequate information and the consent was ‘ deemed approved ' when the board took no action in 45 days . We do n't want a repeat of that situation . ”
Chytilo , along with environmental groups such as the Environmental Defense Center and Surfrider , say that Spectra America has been involved in numerous bankruptcies that had the apparent effect of it avoiding obligations associated with land use development projects and that detailed information about its financial situation is needed .
Tuesday 's meeting is scheduled to begin at 9 a.m. in the Board Hearing Room of the County Administration Building , 105 E. Anapamu St. in Santa Barbara .

ON THE GO : Shane Baker says there 's not much he ca n't handle at his Shane 's Bikes , Boats and Performance workshop .
A LOVE of tinkering with old bikes and cars is what drew Shane Baker to open his own business .
The mechanic opened Shane 's Bikes , Boats and Repairs at 63 Grafton St in January 2001 and has had steady business as the sole employee of the venture since .
`` I had been working as a mechanic and had always loved repairing and fixing stuff , ” Mr Baker said .
`` I suppose it 's everyone 's dream to have their own business until they realise how much work it is in the business .
`` Before I stopped working Saturdays at the beginning of this year it was n't unusual for me to be working as many as 70 hours a week . ”
Despite the long hours , Mr Baker said the job was highly rewarding .
`` It 's great seeing the end product and seeing it run well and being as good as it can be , ” he said .
`` I do a wide range of things from general services on bikes , car , boats and jet skis to performance side of things for cars like custom manufacturing and dyno tuning .
`` There 's not a lot I have to send out of shop and I 'm happy for people to pop in or give me a call about what they might need . ”
Mr Baker said he had garnered a broad customer base over his nearly two decades on the job .
`` I have a lot of repeat customers in town and some who will call up having come to Warwick for motor racing or the drags who need something fixed in a hurry , ” he said .
`` I 've also had customers as far south as Tamworth and Grafton and as far west as St George .
`` I 'm a big believer in doing a job once and doing it right . ”

A Federal High Court sitting in Lagos , will tomorrow , hear an application by Sell Petroleum Development Company , SPDC , seeking a stay in the garnishee order nisi made by the court in respect of judgment debt in the suit by Ejama community , an Ogoni community in Rivers State , against SPDC and First Bank Limited .
Ejama community , the judgment creditor , had alleged failure of the judgment debtor ( Shell ) and the bank that guaranteed the debt ( First Bank ) to pay N122 billion judgment debt to the community as ordered by the court .
Shell in a separate application is asking the judge to strike out the contempt proceeding initiated against the bank and its Chairman by the community .
It will be recalled that the trial judge , Justice Ibrahim Buba , had after about five hours of argument by counsel in the matter on May 16 , 2018 , adjourned till May 19 , for judgment in the contempt proceeding initiated against First Bank over its alleged refusal to honour the bank guarantee it provided on behalf of Shell and the garnishee order nisi made by an Owerri division of the Federal High Court in respect of the bank guarantee .
But , Shell filed two separate motions before the judgment date , seeking a stay in the garnishee order nisi and the dismissal of the contempt proceedings .
It will be recalled that in the substantive suit , 10 indigenes of Ejama community in Ogoniland , Rivers State , had sued Royal Dutch Shell Plc , Netherlands , Royal Dutch Shell Plc , United Kingdom and SPDC , over oil spills that occurred when Shell operated in the community at the Port Harcourt Division of the court .
Justice Buba then of the Port Harcourt Division of the court had in his judgment in 2010 , awarded N17 billion to the representatives of the Ogoni people .
The court equally granted the Ogoni chiefs 25 per cent interest charge on the principal sum of the N17 billion .
SPDC then appealed the judgment and applied for a stay of execution of the judgment pending the appeal .
As a condition for granting the stay of execution , the court required Shell 's bankers , First Bank , to provide a guarantee of the judgment sum .
The community meanwhile , stated that by its calculation and computation of 25 per cent interest charge on the principal sum of about N17 billion , what is due them is N122 billion . This figure was however , disputed by First Bank and Shell .
A HOLIDAY accommodation body has approved a range of price caps for tourist rentals in Mallorca after its members voted unanimously in favour last Tuesday .
The measures come as the Consortium of the Tourist Accommodation Exchange ( CBAT ) was reportedly at loggerheads with the Consell de Mallorca over the plans . CBAT governs the rates for inter-business trading of holiday lets .
Hotels and single-family properties have had prices set at €3,500 , or €700 in annual instalments . Multi-family rentals are priced at €875 in the rules , or €175 annually . The maximum period properties can be rented out for is 60 days and payments can be split over five years .
The Consortium has around 42,000 lets in its stocks . Businesses will only be able to bid once authorities on the island approve tourist zoning measures which are due to be in place in time for the peak summer season .

Most of the companies often participate in the exhibitions and events to enhance their brand image in the public . These events give the companies a chance to directly interact with their business associates or the customers to have first- hand feedback about their products . But to create a positive image and mingle with the clients and customers the company require experienced exhibition hosts or event promoters who understand their job and make your presence a grand success in the exhibition or the event . Though companies have their own employees to participate in an event it is only expert hosts , trade show models , registration hostess , and moderator etc who can actually do 100 % justice to their job . To find the best trade show models or event hosts the companies often rely on the recruitment agencies for hiring the temporary staff .

Monkeys lack standing to sue for copyright protection and an animal rights group can not act as legal guardian in such matters , a US appeals court has ruled , in a battle over ownership of a smiling “ selfie ” taken by an endangered macaque .
The dispute stemmed from a famous image that Naruto , a rare crested macaque who lives on a nature reserve , snapped using a camera that British photographer David Slater left mounted and unattended during a 2011 trip to Indonesia .
His grinning visage , which Slater published in a wildlife book , went viral and triggered the long-running legal battle over who had the copyright , the animal who snapped the picture or the nature photographer who owned the camera .
“ The panel held that the monkey lacked statutory standing because the copyright act does not expressly authorise animals to file copyright infringement suits , ” said the judges of the 9th US circuit court of appeals based in San Francisco .
Their opinion added that the group , People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals ( Peta ) , which filed as a plaintiff on behalf of Naruto , was not a “ next friend ” of the monkey in a legal sense and failed to establish that it had a significant relationship with him .
“ Denying him [ Naruto ] the right to sue under the US copyright act emphasises what Peta has argued all along – that he is discriminated against simply because he 's a non-human animal , ” Jeff Kerr , the general counsel to Peta , said in a statement .
Peta had argued the monkey was the legal owner of all photos he took . But a federal judge in San Francisco ruled in January 2016 that copyright law does not apply to animals . A settlement was reached out of court in the case last year .
Attorneys for Naruto and Slater announced that Slater had agreed to donate 25 per cent of future revenue from the photograph to charitable groups that protect Naruto and other members of his species in Indonesia .
It was not clear how much the photograph has been worth to Slater , who previously said that fewer than 100 copies of his self-published book had been sold , despite the publicity .
The case was brought in a US court because Slater 's book was available for sale in the United States . – Reuters

West Brom were dealt a significant blow in their hopes of survival as they slipped to a 3-2 defeat at home to relegation rivals Southampton .
Albion took the lead in the opening minutes , when Ahmed Hegazi powered a header past Alex McCarthy , but the Saints turned the game on its head before the break when Mario Lemina and Jack Stephens struck .
James Ward-Prowse sealed the win , before Salomon Rondon pulled one back , and Albion now face an uphill battle to find three sides to finish below them in the table .
What can we take away from the afternoon at The Hawthorns ?
Top class
The team may be struggling , but the club as a whole can beam with pride for how they paid tribute to the late Cyrille Regis .
Everything about the afternoon , between the hours of 1pm and 3pm , was conducted in a truly classy and tasteful manner .
From the excellent match-day programme , to the yellow and green clappers , the video and audio on the screens , the ex-players and legends of the club and , of course , Cyrille 's family - it all made for a very emotional and fitting occasion .
It 's the kind of manner that draws praise from neutrals - but it 's also important to credit the travelling Southampton contingent , who partook in the scarf raising .
Injuries telling
Okay , so we 'd rather not blame extenuating circumstances , Pardew least of all .
It must be said , though , that these injuries are not helping matters . They 're not first-teamers that Albion can really do without .
Seven senior members of the squad were out here ; Hal Robson-Kanu , James Morrison , Kieran Gibbs , Jake Livermore , Nacer Chadli , Jonny Evans and Grzegorz Krychowiak .
That 's a hell of a lot of talent and experience and it was sorely missed today - Albion looked creaky at the back , overrun in midfield and by the end , just desperate in attack .
Opportunity missed
In this run of six very winnable home matches in the Premier League , this was fixture number two .
Albion defeated Brighton in the first game - start as you mean to go on , and all that .
But Albion did n't go on in the same manner ; having beaten Liverpool in the FA Cup , you sensed the tide might be turning .
A goal up and a fully charged Hawthorns behind them , they conspired to throw the game away .
Match number three ? Huddersfield . Another crucial encounter against a side who now join Albion in the relegation zone .
Then come Swansea , Burnley and Leicester - and you sense that the Baggies need to be taking in the region of 12 points from those fixtures to stand any chance of survival .
It 's still so tight
It 's a crushing , demoralising blow . And yet , even though they 've now won one of their last 24 games in the league , Albion are n't exactly cut adrift .
This probably says more about the quality of the division as a whole , because as it stands , three points separate Watford in eleventh and Huddersfield in 19th . Then there 's Albion .
They need to buck their ideas up - make no mistake . They dare n't drop points in the coming games against Huddersfield and Swansea .
Yet while 17th place remains within reach , the players and Pardew know they 're only a couple of results away from changing the landscape .
A new face
Kyle Jameson is not a name that many West Brom fans will recognise - but he made his first appearance in a match-day squad today .
Alan Pardew has n't been afraid to include a number of teenagers on his bench since arriving , and Jameson is the latest .
Hamstrung by injuries to senior players , Pardew was forced to name a youthful bench indeed - Rekeem Harper , Sam Field and Oliver Burke brought the average age down , it 's fair to say !
Jameson was snapped up on deadline day in the summer from Chelsea .
He is a centre-back who turned 19 in September .
Abuja – Miracle Ikechukwu has emerged the new head of House on the ongoing Big Brother Naija ‘ Double Wahala ' , winning the title for the second time .
Miracle beat other housemates when he emerged the first to knock down all the bottles using the tennis ball in the stockings provided .
He chose his love interest Nina to share the luxury room with .
‘ Biggie ' had cancelled automatic immunity and “ save and replace ' powers for the Head of House two weeks ago .
The powers attached to the title this week will be announced after the nominations on Monday .
Miracle takes over from Nina who led the house last week and led her to victory , as they won their wager .
In his first reign , the housemates won the wager , making him the first Head of House to attain the victory .
On Sunday , Miracle scaled through eviction , gaining the highest vote percentage of 27.98 percent against Teddy A , Alex , CeeC , Tobi , Lolu , BamBam and Anto .
In this season , tagged ‘ Double Wahala ' , housemates are competing for prizes worth N45 million . ( NAN )
Bank of Ireland chief executive Francesca McDonagh is likely to have drawn a few blank stares from members of the Oireachtas finance committee this week when she insisted she was pressing ahead with a “ robust ” internal investigation into the tracker scandal .
In fairness to McDonagh , she has only been in the job four months , and the crisis is not of her making , but the thought of bankers investigating bankers is unlikely to have set anybody 's mind at ease that the bottom of all this will be reached .
Whatever about the naysayers , McDonagh said individuals found to be at fault will be held accountable . However , she also said that from “ the work I 've seen ” there was “ no intent to charge customers incorrectly ” . Move along now .
McDonagh also revealed that 14 of the bank 's borrowers lost residential properties as a result of the scandal , including eight owner-occupiers and six buy-to-let borrowers .
Ulster Bank was also in the dock . The bank has been criticised by members of the committee recently for dragging its heels in dealing with all this . It 's fair to say members ' humour wo n't be improved on talk of yet more affected borrowers .
The bank 's chief financial officer Paul Stanley said the bank expects the number of customers caught up in the debacle to rise within the next few weeks as it continues to engage with regulators on the matter .
The Irish Times reported in December that the bank 's current number of 3,500 affected cases may rise by as much as 3,000 . Stanley also said that about 15 owner-occupier borrowers and one buy-to-let customer lost their homes .
And the carnage does n't stop there . The 200 staff Ulster Bank has working on resolving the scandal stand to lose their jobs once the sorry mess is cleared up . Stanley said “ a number of those staff were at risk already of redundancy ” when the scandal broke .
He also said the affair had boosted the bank 's income by up to €120 million over a decade .
As the redress and compensation programme gathers pace , banks have set up appeals panels to deal with the potentially thousands of customers who may query what their bank is offering them .
Greencore chief eats humble pie
The world of finance is often clouded in bluster and doublespeak , but credit to Greencore chief executive Patrick Coveney who took the unusual step at this week 's annual general meeting of admitting the company “ had n't delivered for shareholders ” .
Coveney held his hands up and said the convenience food giant had underestimated various restructuring and investment costs associated with acquisitions and divestments , and had “ made a mess of its IT investment ” .
“ In truth , we 've been struggling a bit , ” he said – and , to be fair , he 's right . The company 's share price tumbled nearly 15 per cent over the year , while the “ mess ” over IT triggered a €33.7 million impairment charge before a 74 per cent slump in pretax profits .
There was better news for another Irish food group as Total Produce acquired an initial 45 per cent stake in US-based Dole Food Company for $ 300 million in cash ( €242 million ) , with the expectation it will buy the remainder within five years .
The deal was described as a significant step in the company 's history , bringing together two global brands and creating the world 's leading fruit and vegetable group .
Staying with food , Swiss-Irish baked food company Aryzta finally managed to shift its troubled Cloverhill facilities in Chicago . Mind you , the owner of Cuisine de France is likely to be walking away from the asset with a significant loss .
On top of the fact that Cloverhill has bled the company 's North American 's revenues , Investec estimated that the sale to Hostess Brands is likely to be for considerably less than the touted €100 million . Aryzta acquired the facility for around $ 390 million in 2014 .
Meanwhile , in Brussels , the long-awaited beef deal between the EU and the Latin American countries of Mercosur may be just a matter of weeks away , with ministerial meetings to take place on Monday .
Emissions scandal hits horror movie territory
It sounds like something from a bad horror movie , but revelations this week of emissions tests on monkeys in the United States and 25 human volunteers in Germany have brought the scandal to a whole new low .
Volkswagen , alongside BMW , Daimler and Bosch , co-financed tests on monkeys and human volunteers that involved inhaling emissions that included noxious nitrogen dioxide .
The German government understandably flipped and said the tests were “ justified by nothing ” . VW chief Matthias Müller described the tests as “ wrong , unethical and repugnant ” before he conceded that “ the crisis at Volkswagen is not yet over ” .
The European Commission also upped the ante , giving Berlin until Monday to present effective measures for cleaner air – or be hauled before the European Court of Justice .
The effects of Dieselgate are being felt in the Republic too , with recent scandals coupled with political promises to ban diesel cars by 2030 contributing to a fall of 17 per cent in sales of this kind of car during January compared with last year .
New car sales generally for the all-important month of January were down 4.8 per cent on 2017 to 37,125 . In contrast , used car imports rose 20.3 per cent on the same month last year , with 9,061 cars brought into the Republic last month .
Then there 's the move to electric , which has yet to take hold . Taxi drivers and operators of other public service vehicles are set to benefit from a new €7,000 grant scheme aimed at encouraging them to opt for such vehicles , as the Government moves to tackle the emissions issue .
Eir departure leaves a vacuum in National Broadband Plan
The Republic and major infrastructure projects are simply not comfortable bedfellows .
The latest mess concerns the Government 's long-awaited rural broadband scheme , which was thrown into disarray this week with the surprise withdrawal of Eir , the State 's largest telecoms group , from the procurement process .
Eir , which had been favourite to win the contract , said it was withdrawing because the risks had become “ too great ” , citing “ growing uncertainty ” about regulatory and pricing issues .
The move came just months ahead of the scheduled start of the State-subsidised scheme , which aims to bring high-speed broadband to 542,000 homes and businesses in rural parts of the State , which are currently not served by broadband providers .
Eir 's exit leaves just one bidder – the consortium led by energy group SSE and telecoms firm Enet – in the procurement process , raising serious questions about competitiveness and the Government 's ability to get value for money .
Minister for Communications Denis Naughten insisted the scheme would still be delivered on time and at no extra cost to the taxpayer , but industry sources have said the plan is likely to cost more than the €1 billion previously signalled .

MIRAMAR , Fla. - Florida Highway Patrol troopers closed Florida 's Turnpike in both directions from Hollywood Boulevard to the border with Miami-Dade County for about an hour Monday , after a man climbed on the fenced area of an overpass and threatened to jump .
The man 's erratic behavior also prompted Miramar Police Department officers to close Miramar Parkway in both directions from Island Drive to Southwest 68th Avenue from about 12:30 to 1 p.m .
More Traffic Headlines
Police officers persuaded the man to get off a fence that covers the pedestrian walkway on Miramar Parkway . He was running from side to side and was bouncing up and down on the fence that is meant to prevent pedestrians from jumping off to incoming traffic .

The Trump administration is rolling back the Obama-era requirement that employer-provided health insurance policies cover birth control methods at no cost to women .
According to senior officials with the Department of Health and Human Services , the goal of the new rule is to allow any company or nonprofit group to exclude the coverage for contraception if it has a religious or moral objection .
`` This provides an exemption , and it 's a limited one , '' said Roger Severino , director of the HHS Office of Civil Rights . `` We should have space for organizations to live out their religious identity and not face discrimination . ''
He said he expects that most companies will continue to provide coverage for birth control and that the changes will only affect a tiny percentage of U.S. women . The new rules are being published Friday in the Federal Register and go into effect immediately .
But some health policy analysts say the new rule creates a huge opening that lets any employer claim an exemption , leaving their female workers to pay the full cost of any birth control out of pocket .
`` It is a huge loophole for any employer that does not want to provide birth control coverage to their employees , '' says Dania Palanker , a professor at Georgetown University 's Center on Health Insurance Reform .
The change fulfills a promise President Trump made in May to the Catholic religious order The Little Sisters of the Poor in a ceremony in the White House Rose Garden . The nuns had sued the Obama administration over the birth control requirement .
The Affordable Care Act , also known as Obamacare , requires employer-provided health insurance policies to include coverage for preventive health care . After the law passed , HHS used its regulatory authority to specify what has to be included in those preventive services and birth control , including `` all Food and Drug Administration approved contraceptive methods , sterilization procedures , and patient education and counseling for all women with reproductive capacity . ''
But the policy was controversial from the start .
Several companies and religious groups sued , saying the rule infringed on their religious freedom .
The Obama administration created an exemption for churches and allowed other `` religious employers '' to opt out by notifying the government . When they did so , the administration would arrange with their insurance companies to provide the coverage directly , without the employers ' involvement .
But the Little Sisters of the Poor were n't happy with that workaround and sued .
The group 's case , and a second one involving private businesses including the Hobby Lobby chain of craft stores , which has 32,000 employees , went to the Supreme Court .
The court ruled in favor of Hobby Lobby in 2014 , saying privately held companies could object on religious grounds . And then , last year , the court issued a split ruling in the Little Sisters case , saying the government should n't fine the nuns but ordering the two sides to work out an arrangement that accommodates their religious beliefs .
Before a deal was reached , Trump became president .
At the Rose Garden ceremony in May , he told the Little Sisters of the Poor that he planned to change the rules . `` Your long ordeal will soon be over , '' he promised .
Under the new rule , women who work for Hobby Lobby or the religious group may no longer have access to birth control coverage through the Obama-era workaround . A Hobby Lobby spokesman said the company would have no comment on Friday , and the Little Sisters of the Poor did n't respond to NPR 's emails seeking comment .
Hobby Lobby 's founder and CEO David Green told reporters in 2013 , `` Our family is now being forced to choose between following the laws of the land that we love or maintaining the religious beliefs that have made our business successful and have supported our family and thousands of our employees and their families . ''
HHS officials said they do n't expect many companies to seek waivers . They said the group seeking waivers will likely be limited to those about 200 companies and nonprofits that have already sued .
But Palanker says the impact could be a lot bigger . There are a lot of large private companies , she says , whose owners may hold strong religious beliefs but did not want the publicity and expense of suing the federal government .
`` A lot of women will retain birth control coverage , '' Palanker says , `` but there will be a lot of women who will lose that coverage . ''
That means they 'll find themselves paying out of pocket . A one-month supply of birth control pills can cost anywhere from $ 4 to $ 55 or more , according to GoodRX.com .
Longer-acting contraception , like an intrauterine device , can cost more than $ 1,000 , says Sarah Lipton-Lubet , a vice president at the National Partnership for Women and Families . She says the new rule is a tool for discrimination against women .
`` Women should n't be denied access to basic health care based on their employers ' religious beliefs , '' she says . `` We all have the right to our religious beliefs . But the way that this rule treats religion is really an excuse to discriminate . ''
HHS officials say they also plan more stringent enforcement of a provision in the Affordable Care Act that prohibits federal subsidies from being used for insurance policies that cover abortion . The agency will issue guidelines for insurers Friday on how they have to charge women who want abortion coverage at least $ 12 a year more for such a policy , and they have to keep that money in a separate fund to be used only to pay for abortions .
The Trump administration 's rule is likely to face its own legal challenges from groups that favor contraception .

Shigellosis - a nasty bug which is highly infectious - is making headlines .
An outbreak of the condition is sweeping through schools across the Midlands , the Hull Daily Mail reports .
And , naturally , many parents are worried .
So , what is it and how can you get rid of it ?
Put simply , the condition causes vomiting , diarrhoea , fever and stomach cramps and is usually passed from person to person .
The illness is most commonly seen in child-care settings and schools .
Dr David Kirrage , consultant with PHE West Midlands health protection team , said people should practice good infection control .
`` Effective handwashing is also helpful in controlling norovirus and flu , which are also in circulation at this time of year and which could account for some of the cases we are seeing , '' he said .
`` So people should wash hands regularly and thoroughly with soap and warm water , particularly after using the toilet , changing children 's nappies and before preparing or eating food . ''
Here 's our guide to the illness and what you can do about it .
What is shigellosis and what are the symptoms ?
Shigellosis is an infectious disease caused by a group of bacteria called Shigella .
Symptoms of shigellosis typically start one to two days after exposure and include diarrhoea ( sometimes bloody ) , fever and abdominal pain .
Symptoms usually last for between five and seven days .
People usually make a full recovery .
How is it treated ?
People with mild shigellosis may need only fluids and rest .
Anti-diarrhoea medications should be avoided .
Antibiotics can be useful for severe cases of shigellosis because they can reduce the duration of symptoms .
However , Shigella is often resistant to antibiotics .
Tell your healthcare provider if you do not get better within a couple of days after starting antibiotics .
He or she can do additional tests to learn whether the strain of Shigella is resistant to the antibiotic you are taking .
How can I reduce my risk of getting it ?
Practising good hand-washing is key here .
Wash your hands thoroughly before preparing food or eating , after going to the toilet and after changing nappies .
If you have the infection , avoid preparing food for others and wash your hands frequently .
It is advisable to stay at home until you have been symptom-free for 48 hours .

NEW YORK — A 19-year-old Canadian has pleaded guilty to terrorism related charges in the U.S .
The U.S. Justice Department says Abdulrahman El Bahnasawy was one of three people arrested in New York City in connection with an alleged Islamic State-inspired plot more than a year ago .
The plot was revealed Friday after the case was unsealed .
A justice department news release issued Friday says El Bahnasawy , who has been in custody since the FBI arrested him in May 2016 , pleaded guilty to terrorism offences and is awaiting sentencing .
The release says El Bahnasawy is from Mississauga , Ont .
The other two accused are an American citizen and a citizen from the Philippines .

The wife of Ekiti governor , Mrs Feyisetan Fayose , on Wednesday called on residents of the state to collect their Permanent Voters Cards and vote wisely in the July 14 governorship election .
Fayose gave the advice on Wednesday when she visited the Ekiti University Teaching Hospital , Ado-Ekiti , and the State Specialist Hospital , Ikere -Ekiti .
She urged residents to vote for the candidates of their choice while refraining from actions likely to result in violence .
The governor 's wife , who paid the bills of more than 100 indigent patients in both hospitals , said she would visit the facilities again before the expiration of her husband 's tenure .
The Chief medical Director of the University Teaching Hospital , Dr Kolawole Ogundipe , had expressed gratitude to the governor 's wife for her regular visits to the hospital .
One of the beneficiaries , Mr Samuel Omotayo , thanked Fayose for paying their hospital bills , praying that God would continue to bless her . ( NAN )

Iraq 's federal government has announced resumption of paying the salaries of Kurdish civil servants and Peshmerga security forces , which had been frozen in the wake of tensions between Baghdad government and Kurdish authorities over a non-binding Kurdish independence vote .
“ The finance ministry of the central authorities has transferred the salaries of all the civil servants in Kurdistan , including the Peshmerga , ” the office of Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi said on Twitter on Monday .
Iraqi government spokesman Saad al-Hadithi also said in all `` around 317.5 billion Iraqi dinars '' ( around $ 262 million ) had been transferred to cover salaries for one month .
A similar amount would be sent to the semi-autonomous Kurdistan r egionevery month as long as authorities there respected conditions laid out by Baghdad , he added .
Earlier this month , Iraq 's parliament ratified an $ 88.5 billion budget for 2018 . Kurdish legislators boycotted the vote in protest at the reduction of Kurdistan 's part of the national budget from 17 to 12.6 percent .
On March 13 , Iraqi Prime Abadi said the airports of Kurdish capital city of Erbil and Kurdistan 's second-largest city Sulaimaniyah would again “ open to international flights ” after a nearly six-month air blockade .
The referendum on secession of the Kurdistan region was held on September 25 last year despite strong opposition from Iraqi authorities , the international community , and Iraq 's neighboring countries , especially Turkey and Iran .
Following the vote , Baghdad imposed a ban on direct international flights to the Kurdish region and called for a halt to its independent crude oil sales .
On October 12 , an Iraqi government spokesman said Baghdad had set a series of conditions that the KRG needed to meet before any talks on the resolution of the referendum crisis could start .
“ The KRG must first commit to Iraq 's unity . The local authorities in the [ Kurdistan ] region… must accept the sovereign authority of the federal government on… oil exports , [ as well as ] security and border protection , including land and air entry points , ” the unnamed Iraqi official added .
On October 16 , Iraqi federal forces retook control of the Kurdish-held city of Kirkuk .
Abadi has already demanded the annulment of the referendum .
“ We wo n't accept anything but its cancellation and the respect of the constitution , ” he said in a statement on October 26 during a visit to Tehran .

Hank Williams was one of the earliest celebrities to “ live fast , love hard , die young and leave a beautiful memory ” . He turned country music upside down with songs that came from the deepest recesses of his being . Many biographies have been written about him but none gives such detail of his drinking , sexual abandon and many misadventures as this .
From a poor background , Williams hardly knew his father , overindulged in drink and drugs from an early age to deal with chronic back pain ( perhaps due to undiagnosed spina bifida ) and did n't worry too much about how young his sexual partners might be .
Much of the book explores the love-hate relationship with the women in his life , especially his mother , his effective manager who kept him near to home so she could access his earnings , and his wife , with whom he constantly quarrelled . Mark Ribowsky analyses the songs well and traces Williams 's influence on rock-and-roll greats Buddy Holly and Chuck Berry but does n't satisfactorily explain the “ mixture of bravado and fear ” that he regards as the essence of his subject .
Fifth Third Bancorp has given CEO Greg Carmichael the additional title of chairman , combining the two roles for the first time since it split them apart during the financial crisis .
Carmichael succeeds Marsha Williams , who has moved into the role of lead independent director of the Cincinnati bank . The change takes effect immediately .
The combination of the chairman and CEO roles is a notable reversal at a company that , against industry norms , had kept them separate for the better part of a decade . Fifth Third stripped CEO Kevin Kabat of his chairman title in May 2010 as the company was taking a hit on bad loans during the financial crisis ; Kabat was named vice chairman two years later .
Rationale “ This promotion recognizes Greg 's contributions and the board 's confidence in his ability to guide our organization , ” says Marsha Williams , who moves from chairman to lead independent director to make way for Carmichael at the head of the board .
Many corporate governance experts have argued that more banks and other public companies should put the chairman and CEO roles in different hands to promote the independence of boards of directors . Wells Fargo split the jobs in late 2016 after its fake-accounts scandal forced CEO John Stumpf to resign , and the decision prompted calls for other banks to adopt the same policy .
“ This promotion recognizes Greg 's contributions and the board 's confidence in his ability to guide our organization , ” Williams said in a press release issued late Thursday by Fifth Third . Williams joined the board in 2008 . She retired two years later than chief financial officer at Orbitz .
Fifth Third 's release pointed to steps Carmichael has taken to improve profitability and improve technology since taking over as CEO in November 2015 . The $ 142 billion-asset company also noted that it recently received a top score on its Community Reinvestment Act exam after receiving a “ needs to improve ” rating in July 2016 .
Return on average assets was 1.43 % as of Dec. 31 , or 32 basis points higher than a year earlier . Return on tangible common equity was 15.2 % .
Notably , until this year , Fifth Third was the largest publicly traded bank with a female board chair . Wells Fargo now holds that distinction after Elizabeth Duke took over as chairman on Jan. 1 .
SWEETWATER COUNTY — The case of a man charged with a range of offenses stemming from a Sheriff 's Office investigation was bound over to District Court at his preliminary hearing Tuesday morning in Circuit Court in Rock Springs .
Sheriff Mike Lowell said Allen James “ A.J. ” Hendrickson , 29 , was arrested in Rock Springs on June 2 by Corporal Steve Powell on a warrant charging him with Strangulation of a Household Member , two counts of Domestic Battery ( Second Offense ) , two counts of False Imprisonment , and Unlawful Contact Without Bodily Injury .
As described in court documents , on May 9 , 2017 , Aubrey Jones , Hendrickson 's ex-wife , was found unconscious in her vehicle at a highway underpass east of Rock Springs . She told investigating deputies that she 'd gone to the underpass to help Hendrickson with a flat tire and he had “ back-handed her across the face ” and “ has threatened to kill her and her daughter on prior occasions . ”
Jones also said that several days before , on May 6 , she told Hendrickson that “ she was going to leave , but he told her she was n't allowed to leave , ” and that on May 7 , Hendrickson “ picked her up and threw her on the floor… got on top of her and covered her nose and mouth with one hand , and grabbed her throat with his other hand… ” and “ choked her so hard she saw silver stars ” and “ while he was choking her , he told her that she was going to make him kill her ” and she “ was ‘ going black ' as if she was going unconscious . ”
The documents also reference a prior instance when Jones told an investigating deputy she 'd been injured by Hendrickson and describe abrasions , contusions , and bruises he observed directly .
Hendrickson remains in custody at the Sweetwater County Detention Center under a cash or surety bond of $ 50,000 .

The OnePlus 5T is a fantastic smartphone . Not only does it have the best fast-charging capabilities of any flagship handset , but it also costs just $ 499 . However , it turns out the device is n't free of caveats . Despite having full-HD capable screens , both the OnePlus 5T and its OnePlus 5 predecessor ca n't stream high-definition content from video services such as Netflix , Amazon Prime , Google Play movies , and others . Thankfully , the company says a future update will address the issue .
The problem was brought to light on OnePlus ' forums , where one user pointed out that the problem is related to the phones ' lack of support for Google 's Widevine level 1 DRM , which many services require for HD streaming .
OnePlus devices do support Widevine level 3 , but that 's only used for standard definition streams . As Android Police explains , level 1 requires that content processing and control operations , which are meant to protect the copyright holder , happen in a “ Trusted Execution Environment , ” which is n't implemented on the OnePlus 5 and 5T . Other similarly priced devices , such as the ZTE Axon 7 , also lack Widevine support beyond level 3 .
`` I would like to know why a £500 phone is not capable of fully utilising these very popular services and if there are any plans to rectify this clearly ridiculous issue , ” wrote OnePlus forum user whatthefunk .
`` I am massively surprised this has not been brought up in reviews/not had a bigger fuss made about as this is completely unacceptable for a brand that is now well established . ''
A company spokesperson has confirmed it is working on an update to bring Widevine level 1 support to the OP5T and OP5 . No word yet on when it 'll arrive , or why it was left out in the first place .

What more can be said about food and its importance in our lives than what has already been said before ? Perhaps , it was this dilemma that led to the creation of so many common phrases and idioms which are derived from food .

Gardaí stationed near the Border are seeking the return of machine guns to individual stations ahead of a possible hard Brexit .
They are also asking the Minister for Justice and Garda management for more Armed Support Units ( ASUs ) to help police the estimated 208 crossings along the 500km Border .
Gardaí along the Border say criminals and subversives see the force as weak and ill-equipped and they are correct , according to Garda Brendan O'Connor who represents Donegal-based members for the Garda Representative Association ( GRA ) .
“ Our members feel that criminals and the cross-Border drug dealers and people of a political persuasion , they do n't take us seriously . They do n't see us as having the capabilities to take them on . They see us as weak . They see us as we see ourselves – untrained , ill-equipped and not enough numbers . ”
Israeli-made Uzi sub-machine guns were issued to local detective units until 2012 when Garda management said the gun no longer suited requirements .
Detectives ' Smith and Wesson revolvers , which carried six rounds , were also replaced with the 15-shot SiG Sauer handgun . Management said the Sauer , with its increased capacity , would fill the role of both the Uzi and the revolver .
Now GRA representatives want the Uzi , or another automatic machine gun such as the MP7 , to be reissued to non-specialised gardaí for use in emergencies .
The association , which has been meeting in Wexford , is also asking for Tasers and body-cameras to be issued to all front-line gardaí .
Having an automatic weapon in each station would allow gardaí to respond to serious situations and provide cover while Armed Support Units are mobilised , Garda O'Connor said .
‘ Scramble armed units '
“ Ten years ago gardaí could scramble armed units at local level with the Uzi available at local district level . It was n't ideal , but it was a deterrent , ” he said .
“ That capability has been taken away despite the threat being greater . And unfortunately cross-Border criminals have access to arms and are n't afraid to use them . Our members are extremely vulnerable on the Border without proper backup .
“ If we have an incident now , what do we have ? A couple of detectives with a side arm for personal protection and no tactical training . It 's just simply not up to the threat and the danger that 's there . ”
He added : “ We need a deterrent . Our members need the confidence to know when they stand on the road and put up their hand that , whoever that person is coming along , feels there will be consequences to their actions . ”
Garda O'Connor said gardaí also want more ASUs , covering a wider geographical area , particularly around the Border .
There are currently two ASU 's in Border areas , one in Dundalk , Co Louth , and the other in Ballyshannon , Co Donegal , meaning it could take hours for a unit to reach a scene , he said . Garda O'Connor said he would like to see one in every division .
‘ Gathering of evidence '
Minister for Justice Charlie Flanagan said issues like firearms and Tasers are a matter for the Garda Commissioner . However , he said he supports the introduction of a body camera “ in principle ” .
“ I do believe they will add considerably to the work of An Garda Síochána and I would hope that over a period of time consideration would be given towards having such a scheme . It would protect them in their duties and it would also be important in the gathering of evidence , ” he said at the GRA 's annual conference in Wexford on Wednesday .
“ I 'm in favour of them but I understand there is a process and there are also resources issues . ”
A garda working group is currently examining different models of body cameras , including cameras which provide a constant “ live feed ” back to a control centre and ones which store the footage locally on the device before it is uploaded later .
And the Aggies ' hire is making a big impression on at least one nationally recognized voice in college football .
ESPN 's Kirk Herbstreit went on ESPN San Antonio last week and set some high expectations for Fisher and the Aggies .
`` In two years , they 're gon na come back to being a perennial power , '' Herbstreit said . `` Because the combination of resources -- their facilities now are probably the best , they set the bar in the whole country -- the tradition of winning there , and Jimbo Fisher is maybe not as appreciated as he should be as a coach . He 's got a great staff he 's bringing with him . The recruiting base that they have , they 're different than Texas and all those great schools in the state of Texas because they 're in the SEC . He can still go into Louisiana and recruit . It has all the makings of a home run . And we 'll see . He 's got to get a quarterback and a guy that kind of understands his system . ''
Herbstreit was also asked how much patience he thinks Fisher will receive from the A & M faithful .
`` Right now it 's the honeymoon period . Everyone 's excited , he 's probably going to have a great recruiting class even though he does n't have a lot of time . But I think A & M , when you pay him like that , if you do n't get instant results , there 's going to be some noise . But hopefully the A & M lunatic fringe - everybody has the lunatic fringe - hopefully the masses can keep things in place . Because look what he 's inheriting . A & M has been very , very up-and down for the last four or five years . He 's got to build consistency back into that program . ''

Sunday 's rainfall was so heavy in south Birmingham the resultant floodwater lifted manhole covers out of the road .
Now , further floods are predicted this week , with a yellow warning in place .
A leading University of Birmingham academic says that we only have ourselves to blame for the recent spate of floods because of the way in which the city has been developed around its three rivers – the Rea , Cole and Tame .
And unless water is “ contained at source ” on the rivers ' floodplains , he argues , problems in the urban environment will not be resolved .
The city is also on a plateau which can force air upwards , a major factor in the tornado of 2006 which tore through Moseley and Balsall Heath .
( Image : Chris Bradley )
Factor in areas of clay and a high water table and localised flooding can occur in built-up areas during periods of sustained heavy rain .
Dr Chris Bradley , senior lecturer in Geography and Environmental Science , lives near to the Pershore Road trouble spot in Selly Park
On Sunday , when it is estimated that a month 's worth of rain fell in just one hour , he witnessed at first hand the devastation that flood water can bring .
( Image : Chris Bradley )
“ This was the third flood in the area in the past decade , ” he said , referring to previous events in 2008 and 2016 .
“ But the only previously documented flood ( of this severity ) was in the 1920s when people were pictured in a boat on Sir Johns Road .
“ A number of factors contribute to the recent spate of floods in this area , including the construction of the Selly Oak bypass further upstream which has increased the rate of water movement through the catchment downstream . ”
( Image : Graham Young )
Dr Bradley said that another contributing factor may be recent developments on the floodplain which will have reduced the potential for flood-water storage .
A floodplain is defined as ‘ an area of low-lying ground adjacent to a river , formed mainly of river sediments and subject to flooding ' .
Dr Bradley said : “ The message we have to get across is that to stop flooding downstream , you have to hold water at source .
( Image : Google Maps )
“ Significant volumes of water also pass through the sewerage system which has a limited capacity : at one point on Sunday , the water was lifting the manhole covers out of the road ( at the junction of Oakfield Road , Pershore Road and Sir Johns Road where the encircled white dot is in the picture above ) .
“ My 14-year-old daughter tells me that each of the three convection storms in the past decade has been at a similar time of the day with warmer air ( contributing to extra rainfall ) .
Dr Bradley said the cause of the most recent flood was similar to the one in 2016 which left a BMW on top of a garden wall in Fourth Avenue .
“ On both occasions flood waters from the Bourn Brook overtopped the bank and flowed onto the Pershore Road .
`` It then passed along Sir Johns Road , and Fourth and Third Avenues towards the River Rea , ” he explained .
( Image : University of Birmingham )
“ The channel of the Bourn Brook , as it passes under the Pershore Road and through the Nature Centre , does n't have enough capacity to cope .
`` Considerable volumes of water overspilled on to the road going to Third Avenue and Sir Johns Road . ”
What is the Bourn Brook ?
( Image : Graham Young )
As well as giving rise to the name of a pub on the Bristol Road , it is a ‘ main stem ' river heading towards the River Rea .
To get there it crosses the Pershore Road – underground .
Visitors to the Birmingham Wildlife Conservation Park ( formerly the Nature Centre ) can see from a bridge where it joins the River Rea .
Dr Bradley said : `` Technically , my understanding is that the Bourn Brook is defined as a 'main stem ' river for management purposes . The significance is that the Environment Agency is then responsible for management rather than the council 's drainage engineering department .
( Image : Graham Young )
“ On Sunday , there was some sewer flooding which raised the manhole covers .
“ We will have to look at the weather radar to see the spatial distribution of the rain .
`` But it was very localised with an incredible concentration in one hour and no rain ( upstream of the River Rea ) in Longbridge .
( Image : Graham Young )
“ The gauges in Selly Park by Dogpool Lane and at Calthorpe Park suggest the river water was the highest that has been recorded but further upstream , in Longbridge , the River barely responded . ”
As a specialist in this kind of environmental scenario , did Dr Bradley find the storm exciting ?
“ No , ” he said . “ I just had a sense of deja vu ! ”
New Pebble Mill path overlooks flood plain
( Image : Google Maps )
There is a new boardwalk from Pershore Road which takes walkers in between the Bourn Brook to the left and the new Dental Hospital to the right .
A sign from Calthorpe Estates says : “ Strictly no cycling bikes in this area . ”
It adds : “ Welcome . This is private land . Pebble Mill is an active working environment and access to members of the public is provided at the discretion of Calthorpe Estates . Keep to the defined pathways . All dogs must be kept on a lead . Keep noise to a minimum . Do not enter the water . Beware of cyclists on the road . ”
( Image : Graham Young )
The path gives pedestrians a chance to see how big the flood plain area is – and to see how lots of the local land is currently being developed .
The Pebble Mill TV studios closed in 2004 and were then demolished .
In November 2015 , the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh opened a £50 million , four-storey Dental Hospital and School of Dentistry on the site .
( Image : Birmingham Mail )
The Duke of Edinburgh raised smiles when he asked onlookers : “ Are you all here to have your teeth done ? ”
Another new building is now rising in the corner of Pebble Mill Road and Pershore Road where a sign says : ‘ Circle Birmingham Hospital – state-of-the-art hospital from early 2019 . '
The private healthcare group already has hospitals in Bath , Reading and Nottingham .
( Image : Graham Young )
Its website says the new Birmingham site will “ provide three operating theatres ( expandable to six ) , an endoscopy procedure room , and 18 in-patient bedrooms , packed with the latest technology . ”
Two days after the storm on Tuesday of this week , outline plans for a 97,000 sq ft building with 167 car park spaces in the area were deferred by city councillors .
They cited a lack of information about the proposed eight-storey hospital and research centre .
Local residents will now be wondering how the area will cope with future flood risks it water can not be held at source .
GREENVILLE , N.C. ( WNCT ) – In a vote on Monday , Greenville City Council appointed Shawan M. Barr to fill the vacant District 1 seat .
The seat was previously held by Mayor Kandie Smith who had to step down from the role in order to become mayor .
Barr said , “ I 'm excited about the opportunities to take a seat that is well established by a group of people that I see as mentors . ”
Barr was appointed by city council with a vote of three to two .
“ Well I do community service work , I work with the public , ” said Barr . “ I 've worked with the public for 8 years , with stake-holders and partnerships , so I felt this was an opportunity to continue to serve the community at a higher level . ”
Her time on council might be short as the appointment lasts until November . That 's when the election for the seat takes place .
Barr said she has goals for her time . She said she would like to , “ Not just bridge the gaps but close up gaps as well as have the community and the city to realize that they are in partnership and that we 're working together for a common goal . ”
Barr moved to Greenville in 1986 and has lived in the east ever since .
“ I was raised on Chestnut Street , so I 've lived here for a long time , ”
Councilwoman Rose Glover nominated Barr . She read a statement on how the Civil Rights Act of 1968 calls for majority-minority districts to have fair representation .
When speaking of Barr 's credentials Glover said , “ She is in the community every day with her work . She does survey in the community and underserved communities every year to see what they need for the next year . ”
In what has been a rather emotional few days for the country in response to the events in Charlottesville , Virginia , Barr is making a plea for togetherness .
“ Unity , I want to see unity between the City of Greenville , police department , and West Greenville and district one as a whole . So , I 'm looking forward to uniting . ”

US job growth exceeded expectations in January and wages climbed at the fastest pace since the recession , strengthening the case for a rate rise in March .
Non-farm payrolls rose by 200,000 in January , topping economists ' expectations for 180,000 , according to a Thomson Reuters poll . That compared with a revised 160,000 in December . The report showed strong employment growth in construction , food services and healthcare .
Average hourly earnings rose 0.3 per cent month-over-month and 2.9 per cent year-on-year signalling that the tightness in the labour market was finally pushing through to wages . The year-on-year gain was the quickest since 2009 and topped forecasts for earnings to edge up 2.7 per cent .
The unemployment rate held steady at 4.1 per cent for the fourth consecutive month , in line with expectations .
“ It definitely makes it a bit more likely that the Fed will have to do more than the three hikes that they 're currently planning for this year , ” said Luke Bartholomew , strategist at Aberdeen Standard Investments . “ US bond markets are n't going to like it though . Treasuries have been suffering a sharp sell-off and such strong numbers are going to pour fuel on the fire . ”
Yields
Following the data , the yield on the US 10-year broke above 2.8 per cent while the yield on the more policy sensitive 2-year Treasury note hit its highest level since September 2008 . Yields move inversely to prices . The yield between US 2-year and 10-year Treasuries reached the widest since mid-November , Thomson Reuters data showed .
The Federal Reserve signalled at its monetary policy meeting earlier this week that it was on course for a rate rise in March as policymakers upgraded their outlook for near-term inflation . However , with the US tax overhaul and president Trump 's planned infrastructure spending , some analysts argue that the Fed may need to tighten more aggressively this year .
A more robust labour market is expected to boost wages , and the $ 1.5 trillion ( €1.2 trillion ) tax cut from Congress is also expected to lift wages as many companies have announced bonuses and stock rewards in response to the overhaul .

It is hands down the most repeated line by celebrities in this constantly outraged modern era . The hypersensitive times that we have become accustomed to have forced celebrities , sports stars and everyone to utter the words “ I am sorry if my actions caused offence ” .
This came to mind after watching Liverpool goalkeeper Loris Karius apologising to basically everyone who had spent their hard-earned money only to see him drop balls – and dash hopes and dreams – all within a matter of minutes . Sorry , Karius , if my words caused offence .
But , seriously , what grinds my gears more than players apologising for poor performances is the fake PR constructed apology in front of hordes of journalists and photographers , clicking away as a sports star or general star reads a pre-written speech they had collected at the door a mere five minutes ago . Spoiler alert : the apology more than likely is n't sincere .
The apology is only aimed at sponsors who have decided that type of behaviour does n't reflect well on the brand . Tiger Woods cheating on his ex-wife was n't right for Nike , but accusations of sweatshops and sponsoring centres accused of doping in athletics is okay for the brand .
Nobody can apologise as well as American sports stars . Take Alex Rodriguez . A man who I felt the need to apologise to when , on a trip to New York to see the Yankees play , I accidentally called arguably baseball 's most celebrated player Curtis Granderson . Hey , I do n't know baseball .
But his apology was made when he was accused of taking performance-enhancing drugs . While he rightly acknowledged nobody believed him , one of the best parts of the apology was it arrived to fans via social media in a cursive , hand-written , gold note . The annoying bit was it spread across two pages . Sorry , A-Rod for calling you Curtis , but I 'm also sorry you put time and effort into that apology to only acknowledge two facts : nobody cared , and nobody believed you .
Or how about Mike Tyson , possibly suffering concussion , being made stand up and apologise for being a borderline cannibal .
After munching Evander Holyfield 's ear , an act I admittedly thought was made up by my brothers until I was about 10 and watched a clip on YouTube , Tyson knew we were in shock , borderline horrified . But in a statement disguised in mumbles and rambling , he said what we all probably thought .
“ I 'm only saddened that the fight did n't go on further . . . that the boxing fans of the world might have seen for themselves who would come out on top , ” . Ear nibbling aside , we all thought it .
Serious mistakes
Tyson aside , what are they apologising for ?
I get the fact that some committed serious mistakes , but what pleasure do we get in watching another person falsely apologise just to win back corrupt sponsors and whatever fans are remaining .
Some may say it 's not the words , it 's how they say it . Some may say they have a young fan base who may be influenced to commit said mistakes . But , be serious , when has a young person cheated on their partner and said “ sorry , blame Tiger Woods , he influenced me ” .
My brothers may have threatened to go Mike Tyson , or even I may have threatened to go full on Luis Suarez , but I ca n't imagine facing my mother and saying I was influenced by Suarez or Mike Tyson to bite my brothers ' mid wrestling match .
Apologies are well and good , but when it comes down to it , it 's all about hitting the three Rs in PR . Repent and say you are sorry , take some level of responsibility and do something to put it right . However , we can all see past it .
Enough with the the faux-apology , the non-apology and if-apology . I know an athlete has no clue why they are standing on a podium apologising . I know when the statement was written the person in question barely glanced at it . And I know if they were sorry , they would n't care what the public thinks , they would be trying to make amends privately to those closer to them that they have hurt .
Do n't be sorry you got caught . Do n't be sorry your bank account is slowly draining due to sponsors fleeing the scene of the crime and do n't be sorry if some child repeats your mistake because their parents have decided their kid should be taught and parented by a celebrity . You know , maybe just do n't bother participating in the media circus .
Understand why you need to apologise , get educated about your mistake and fix it for the future . But , do n't waste others ' time and efforts just to win back sponsors and donors to the cause . Apologise for the action , not the reaction . Someday , someone will say it explicitly : “ I did it . I was wrong . I 'm sorry . ”
If , finally , someone 's willing to be sincere .
A man accused of using a rented van to plough into a busy Toronto footpath has been charged with 10 counts of first-degree murder and 13 counts of attempted murder as Canadian authorities attempted to make sense of what is thought to be one of the deadliest incidents of violence in the country 's history .
Alek Minassian ( 25 ) , from Richmond Hill , near Toronto , showed little emotion during a brief court appearance on Tuesday . A grey-haired man , believed to be Minassian 's father , sat in the first row of the courtroom , quietly weeping as the charges were read out .
The “ horrific and deliberate attack ” has left Toronto in mourning , Toronto 's mayor , John Tory , said on Tuesday . It took place around lunchtime on Monday , as crowds were out basking in the sun on one of the first warm days of the year .
Shocked witnesses described watching as a van jumped the kerb of one of the city 's main arteries , zigzagging as it barrelled into pedestrians and oncoming traffic .
“ People started flying in the air , ” Henry Yang , who was driving behind the van as the incident unfolded , told the Toronto Star . “ I started honking my horn , making noises , trying to make a commotion , trying to make people aware that something was going on . I rolled down my windows and started yelling at people , I wanted them to get out of the way . ”
The van crashed through crowds , fire hydrants and a bus shelter . “ It was like he was playing a video game , trying to kill as many people as possible , ” Panna Patel told the Associated Press . “ He was looking people directly in the eye , making eye contact , it was so scary . ”
Canadian authorities have yet to suggest any possible motivation for the attack .
The @ TorontoPolice and first responders faced danger without hesitation today , and I want to thank them for their courage and professionalism . We 'll continue working with our law enforcement partners as the investigation continues . — Justin Trudeau ( @ JustinTrudeau ) April 24 , 2018
Prime minister Justin Trudeau described it as a “ senseless attack and a horrific tragedy ” . He downplayed any possible link to terrorism , saying that at the moment there was no evidence to suggest there is a “ national security element ” to the situation .
‘ Socially awkward '
While police have not yet released the names of those killed in the attack , Anne Marie D'Amico has been identified as one of the victims , remembered by her family as someone with a generous heart “ who always did big things for people ” .
Two South Koreans were also among those killed , officials in Seoul told Agence France-Presse , and another of its citizens was seriously injured .
On Tuesday a portrait began to emerge of Minassian , the young man alleged to have carried out the attack . A computer software student at a Toronto college , he handed in his final project weeks ago .
Joe Pham , who said he recently took a programming class with Minassian , described him as someone who kept to himself . “ He was socially awkward but well spoken , ” Pham said .
Canadian military officials said Minassian joined the Canadian Armed Forces last August but was “ voluntarily released ” weeks later at his own request . He had completed just 16 days of basic training .
Shortly after Minassian 's arrest , police descended on a brick home in Richmond Hill believed to be connected to the 25-year-old . Calling the investigation “ far from over ” , Toronto 's police chief Mark Saunders appealed to witnesses to come forward .
“ We need to identify if there are more people , if he 's working in concert with anyone , or if this was just a lone act on his own doing. ” Minassian was not previously known to police , he said .
The incident unfolded miles north of Toronto 's downtown core , in a neighbourhood that ranks among the city 's most multicultural . Hours after the attack , a makeshift memorial sprung up near the path of devastation , with residents leaving handwritten notes offering condolences and support in several languages .
“ Each life had so much love , ” said Saman Tabasinejad as she planted roses alongside the messages . “ I just want to honour them . ”
The 2km-stretch of city blocks where the incident unfolded remained closed to traffic on Tuesday . The area is expected to stay cordoned off for several days as some 20 officers comb the area for clues in what is expected to be a lengthy investigation .
“ We are looking very strongly to what the exact motivation was for this particular incident to take place , ” said Saunders . “ We need every single piece of this puzzle so we can have a fulsome picture and account as to exactly what took place here. ” – Guardian

PRINCE Charles spends most of the year travelling around the world and sampling all sorts of local dishes .
But even the future King of England was left lost for words when he discovered he had just been served green ants by MasterChef 's contestants .
During a highly-anticpated appearance on Wednesday night 's episode of the cooking show , contestants were given the mammoth task of preparing a meal for the Prince of Wales .
Earlier in the episode , Duchess of Cornwall made a number of candid confessions about her and Prince Charles ' food preferences , confirming they avoided garlic like the plague and always keep ketchup in their fridge .
The contestants were predictably shocked when they found out who they would be cooking for . Picture : Channel 10
To help them plan a menu , Camilla told MasterChef 's contestants what the royal couple liked to eat .
Admitting she was `` very good at a roast and vegetables '' and loved olive oil , Camilla said Charles was a big fan of local cheeses and liked eating home grown food .
When asked by judge Gary Mehigan what foods she could n't live without in her fridge , the Duchess of Cornwall had a surprising confession .
The Duchess of Cornwall revealed she always kept ketchup in the fridge for her grandchildren . Picture : Channel 10
`` I have to have , if I have n't got fresh tomatoes , I 'll always have tomato puree , '' Camilla said . `` And I 'm afraid to say , even ketchup . My grandchildren are rather addicted to ketchup . ''
Camilla and Charles share nine grandchildren and step grandchildren between them , including Prince George , Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis .
When asked what food the contestants should absolutely not serve , Camilla did n't mince her words .
@ ClarenceHouse on @ masterchefau and I can hardly contain myself . Camilla just having a casual chat to Gary is the best thing ever # MasterChefAU pic.twitter.com/51mkrDLf8N — Loren ( @ leapinloren ) 4 July 2018
`` I hate to say this , but garlic , '' she said . `` Garlic is a no-no . ''
`` Because you 're talking , chatting ? '' Gary asked .
`` Exactly . It 's always so - you just have to lay off the garlic , '' Camilla replied .
Setting out to impress the future king of England , contestants whipped an array of canapés using Australian ingredients .
While the wallaby tartare and goat 's cheese mousse with bush spices were well received , pickled cucumber seasoned with green ants raised eyebrows .
That moment when you find out you just ate ANTS ! 🐜😳 # MasterChefAU pic.twitter.com/SGyDUNvX5G — # MasterChefAU ( @ masterchefau ) 4 July 2018
`` I 'm particularly partial about local ingredients . And that 's what makes it so fascinating is the diversity . So , what are all these things ? '' Charles asked as he inspected the contestant 's dishes .
We 've got some muntries on here , local green ants on these canapés , '' judge Matt Preston explained .
`` Green ants ! '' Charles exclaimed with shock .
`` This is something I 'll remember forever ! '' Our contestants had the once in a lifetime opportunity to not only cater for His Royal Highness , The Prince of Wales but also to meet him . @ ClarenceHouse # MasterChefAU pic.twitter.com/nazeRY1NuC — # MasterChefAU ( @ masterchefau ) 4 July 2018
Revealing his `` darling wife '' watched MasterChef , the prince also had some words of advice for the contestants .
`` it 's always worth competing , even if you do n't win , is n't it ? '' he said .

Six Nations preview : France v Ireland
Venue : Stade de France . Kick-off : 5.45pm local time/4.45pm Irish time . On TV : Live on TV3 and BBC 1 .
Ireland enter their Six Nations opener at what is likely to be a chilly , showery Stade de France today as the warmest of favourites against an untried and thus even more unpredictable French team than normal . It is both unprecedented and unnerving .
Ireland are almost everything that France are not , namely in good shape , with settled combinations and on a run of positive results , yet amid the known knowns , there also unknown unknowns , and if one looks throughout the history of these two countries , it is the clashes that take place hereabouts which have provided Ireland with untold grief .
Ireland have managed just two wins here since 1972 , in 2000 and 2014 . Both were founded on some outstanding rugby and three away tries , yet were only won by two points in each instance . In the last three visits here , there has been a draw , a two-point win and a one-point defeat .
By rights , France should have no right to win this one . They are missing key men such as Morgan Parra and Camille Lopez , they have a host of new combinations under a hastily assembled new coaching ticket and have lost their last six Tests .
There is not much discrepancy in the teams ' age profiles , with France 's average age just over 26 and Ireland over 27 , but whereas Ireland average 40.4 caps per man , France average 16.1 . Furthermore , with two debutants starting and another four potentially from the bench , Ireland have another 210 caps among their replacements as against 16 for France .
Moment of magic
Yet if any team can flip form on its head it is Les Bleus . One moment of magic , one stunning try from a counter-attack or in broken play , generously sprinkled with a large helping of Gallic flair would have the Paris crowd in raptures and the events of the last six months/a year will almost be made redundant .
This is especially true if the 19-year-old debutant and wunderkind Matthieu Jalibert makes a strong start . However much his pack and scrumhalf Maxime Machenaud protects him , Jalibert 's first few touches will be significant .
Josh van der Flier , who looks tailor made for the task , and his team-mates will need to limit his time on the ball , and target Jalibert in an altogether more legitimate way than referee Jaco Peyper permitted France to do when roughing up Johnny Sexton here two years ago . Nigel Owens was part of that officiating team that day , but is the main man today , and with Wayne Barnes also on the line , it 's hard to see that being repeated .
France will again bring a strong scrum , and a big pack . One moment of magic from Maxime Medard won the corresponding game two years ago off a dominant French scrum , but Tadhg Furlong , just off the bench , was a boy at Test level then , whereas he 's world-class now , and Robbie Henshaw , who made a rare defensive misread for that try , is in a rich vein of form at outside centre . Along with Bundee Aki , CJ Stander , Cian Healy , Iain Henderson and James Ryan , Henshaw can provide the peerless Conor Murray and Johnny Sexton with enough ammunition to strangle the French , keep them on the back foot and apply scoreboard pressure . There is ball-carrying ballast aplenty in this Irish team to keep possession for long spells .

At his eve-of-match press conference after yesterday 's captain 's run in the Stade de France , Rory Best declined to comment on his attendance at the trial of Ulster and Ireland team-mates Paddy Jackson and Stuart Olding for alleged rape on Wednesday in Belfast .
Asked whether he had been given permission from the IRFU , he repeated : “ No comment. ” When Best was asked if he was aware of the social media storm his attendance had generated , an IRFU spokesperson intervened and said : “ Sorry , we 're not going to react to comments on social media . We 're here to comment on the game . Keep it game focused . ”
Specifically , Ireland are focused on the first 20 minutes . Paris gives little sense of an impending rugby match the day beforehand , and this time has been no different . All will change tomorrow as 80,000 or so clad in blue or green descend upon St Denis , but one can safely presume Ireland 's bus will not arrive late , and nor will Ireland 's focus be anything less than total .
Remodelled team
“ I think because of European rugby now , we 're able to get profiles on people , which is important , ” said Best in relation to Jalibert and this remodelled team , which suggests plenty of Bordeuax games have been downloaded .
“ The big thing is how they [ France ] play as a team . When you look at the team and you look at the caps column , there is a good team but still a lot of inexperience . It 's how that all combines . For us being first up , we ca n't really predict that . All we can do is plan the best we can for what we feel they 're going to deliver and that we look to the individuals . The thing we pride ourselves on is making sure we have our detail nailed on and that we look at the opposition . We 've done that and between now and kick-off we 'll have done that . ”
Although Ireland started with a draw at home to Wales two years ago , they hit the ground running in new windows . Think Chicago and last November 's dissection of South Africa . Forewarned is forearmed , and Ireland 's record in France and the cauldron they know awaits , should also focus the mind .
Uneasy lies the mantle of favouritism , but with Murray and Sexton running the show , Ireland should justify it .

Dean Smith labelled Brentford 's 1-1 draw with Derby County in September “ the most one-sided game ” the Bees have been involved in this season .
Brentford dominated possession in the game at Griffin Park , but had to wait until the 86th for Ollie Watkins to rescue a point for them .
Joe Ledley had headed the Rams in front just 15 minutes into his debut , and it appeared Derby were all set for three points before Watkins struck .

The pair meet at Pride Park Stadium tomorrow afternoon .
“ The home game was the most one-sided game we have been involved in this season , ” Smith said at his pre-match press conference .
“ They went in front very early and had to hold on , defending very deep with 11 behind the ball .
“ It is a game we felt we should have won .
“ They are a good team and are on a good run of form , but so are we . It makes for a really good game .
“ There is a lot of respect but there certainly is n't fear . ”

Derby have kicked on since that point at Brentford , and currently find themselves on a 10-game unbeaten run in the Championship .
Their run of just two defeats in the last 21 league games has seen Gary Rowett 's men climb into second place . They are a point ahead of Aston Villa , in third , ahead of tomorrow 's fixture .
“ He ( Rowett ) has done really well , ” said Smith . “ It is a Premier League club , facility-wise , and they have a lot of ex-Premier League players .
“ There is also a lot of expectation on them and Gary Rowett has gone in there and done a really good job .
“ They are pushing to get that promotion place which their fans believe they should have . ”
Brentford lost their last outing at home to Norwich City , but won the previous two before that against Reading and Bolton Wanderers .
They are just five points off the play-offs .

ABUJA—As part of activities to commemorate this year 's World Tuberculosis Day , the World Health Organisation , WHO , United States Agency for International Development , USAID , the KNCV Tuberculosis Foundation , and the National Tuberculosis and Leprosy Control , Programme , NTBLCP , Monday collaborated to offer free tuberculosis screening and treatment for residents of the Federal Capital Territory , FCT .
The programme , which featured a sensitization programme on early detection and treatment of the ailment , had 1,000 residents benefiting from the outreach .
In a chat with journalists at the Utako Motor Park , where the outreach took place , National Professional Officer in charge of Tuberculosis at WHO , Dr Ayodele Awe , decried the low-level of awareness , among Nigerians , on the need to go for tuberculosis screening .
He said : “ In Nigeria , it is reported that over 400,000 persons are at risk of contracting tuberculosis with an estimated 50,000 deaths but less than 100,000 persons present themselves for TB screening annually . So , this community outreach programmes using the Wellness on Wheels ( WoW ) truck , which has the capacity to screen patients for tuberculosis and produce test results within 110 minutes , will help in the early detection of the disease so that necessary treatment can be commenced to ensure that the ailment does not spread further . ”
Vanguard reports that the WoW truck deployed for the free medical outreach is a state-of the-art mobile diagnostic vehicle for tuberculosis screening which also contains an X-ray machine and a geneXpert machine . It was funded by USAID through KNCV 's Challenge TB program .
Also speaking , the FCT Coordinator of NTBCLP , Dr. Josephine Okechukwu , said some of the symptoms of tuberculosis include ; prolonged cough that lasts for more than two weeks , loss of appetite , night sweating , weight loss , chest pain and difficulty in breathing .
Others , according to her , include enlargement of lymph nodes and failure to thrive and grow among children .
Dr Okechukwu further explained that tuberculosis is curable . She , however , maintained that early diagnosis and treatment was key to stopping the spread of the disease .
“ Tuberculosis is one of the highly infectious diseases in Nigeria . But it is curable , treatable , and preventable . Treatment for TB is free across all level of healthcare institutions in the country . So , residents should come forward for screening and also avail themselves of the free treatment on offer , ” she said .

The vast majority of Brummies will be back at work by January 3 after the Christmas break .
Now , of course you 'd never dream of such a thing , but some will be thinking about how they can extend it .
Research carried out last year found that having the flu is the excuse top brass are the most likely to swallow .
Researchers for AXA PPP healthcare asked 1,000 senior business about staff absence and found many were highly suspicious about their employees excuses for not coming in .
It reveals sets out what employers think are ‘ serious enough reasons ' for an employee to be absent from work .
It 's worth pointing out that Brummies are some of the hardest workers around - with reports suggesting staff here are among the most likely to turn up ill .
However , at the top of the sickie list was flu , followed by back pain and injury caused by an accident .
However , even flu only satisfied just over four in 10 bosses surveyed , with the majority unconvinced .
Stress is the next most reasonable excuse in the eyes of employers , with depression and surgery such as hip or knee replacements narrowly behind .
How you could earn £22,000 a year looking after pets
Common colds , anxiety and migraines only convinced just over 20 per cent of business managers and owners in the study .
Almost eight per cent said they were not convinced by any of the health problems above .
Worryingly , employers scepticism seems to explain why many workers hide the real reason they are asking for time off .
And researchers found staff are much more likely to lie if they need time off for mental health issues than they are for physical health problems .
Less than half the workforce would tell their line manager they were calling in sick because of stress , anxiety or depression , according to the survey .
By contrast , more than 80 per cent would feel comfortable asking for time off because of flu , being injured in an accident or back pain .
People who work for small and medium-sized businesses are particularly likely to expect not to be believed , fear being judged or simply want to keep it private over mental health issues .
Market Research analysts forecast the global medical education market to grow at a CAGR of 16.74 % during the period 2017-2021 .
The following companies as the key players in the global medical education market : Harvard University , Oxford University , Stanford University , University of California , Yale University , and Johns Hopkins University .
Commenting on the report , an analyst from Reports team said : The medical education industry globally has recently been exposed to various education technologies to facilitate the learning process and content consumption . Training sessions and classroom teaching are expected to be increasingly integrated with augmented reality ( AR ) , AI , and VR techniques . These techniques are either used as a standalone solution or in combination to provide optimal benefits to learners . VR devices such as Oculus Rift , Google Cardboard , and VRONE are facilitating online learning methodologies . Miami Childrens Hospital and Next Galaxy in the US are developing VR-based cardiopulmonary resuscitation modules , which are accessible through tablets , smartphones , and VR devices . The move will provide education and training to medical professionals , patients , and healthcare workers.

According to the report , the global economy is facing issues of aging population and as WHO quoted , by 2050 , over 2 billion people will be over 60 years of age . Nations such as Japan , Italy , Greece , and Singapore already have a substantial chunk of the population above 65 years of age . Although repercussions can be observed in the forms of increased spending in social security nets , healthcare is another prominent area where these nations will incur costs .
Further , the report states that the rise in the number of enrollments in medical education and courses is not accompanied in tandem with the availability of trained faculty . Training institutions find it difficult to hire teachers with updated knowledge to teach their students . In addition , industry experts who are qualified in their respective domains are difficult to find . Students look for qualified trainers and teachers while choosing institutions .
About Medical Education
In medical education , physical examination is an essential element of learning to provide students with a hands-on experience and enable them to learn accurate clinical diagnosis . However , medical education requires a high level of self-regulated learning . Owing to the extensive preclinical education involved , students find it challenging to memorize and retain knowledge pertaining to clinical study material . In addition , many of the universities also have limited teaching resources . Despite these challenges , medical educational institutions across the globe have been successfully delivering excellent workforce of physicians and medical professionals .

Thousands of kilometres from the cities of China 's eastern seaboard , millions of Tibetans , Kazakhs , Mongols and other ethnic groups live as nomadic herders on vast grassy uplands in the country 's western reaches , dependent on yak , cows and sheep for milk and meat through sub-zero winters .
These regions , with their natural beauty and cultural diversity , are also home to rare tapeworms less than 3mm long , which spread from wild rodents to livestock and , through contact with dogs , to humans . They cause cysts that slowly enlarge in people 's internal organs . Though symptoms can go unnoticed for years , the result of infection with the disease , echinococcosis , is generally years of suffering followed by a premature death .
A sip of water polluted with parasites from dog faeces in a river near his home in the countryside of China 's Xinjiang region was probably all it took for Tang Zhu , 32 , to contract the disease . It went undetected for years before spreading from his liver to his brain , causing him to go blind , suffer seizures and have difficulty walking .

Xinjiang , a vast region abutting central Asia , is home to snow-capped mountains , deserts and , more recently , the world 's biggest screening and prevention programme for echinococcosis . As he was born locally , Tang qualified for diagnosis and care at what has become a leading surgical centre , Xinjiang Medical University 's affiliated hospital in the regional capital of Urumqi .
Tang was prescribed albendazole to combat the disease and underwent years of chemotherapy to treat cysts in his lungs and liver . Wen Hao , one of the hospital 's surgeons , recalls thinking it would be “ impossible ” to treat Tang . But , against expectations , Tang survived and found work as a masseur in a hospital . “ Without treatment , 10 years ago he would have died , ” Wen says .
Deadly varieties of echinococcosis have claimed lives for centuries in rural areas all over the world , from Iran to France , Kenya and the US , with around a million patients globally and tens of thousands of deaths caused each year . Of the 200,000 new cases estimated to emerge annually , more than half occur in China , but it is only since the late 1990s — thanks to international research revealing the scope of the disease , and political will to spend on areas left behind during China 's economic growth — that authorities have made significant progress on treatment and prevention .
There are two main varieties of echinococcosis , depending on the genus of parasite causing the infection . The most common , cystic form ( known as CE ) is caused by parasite embryos lodged in organs — generally the liver but also the lungs and , more rarely , the brain — where they develop into larvae in the form of fluid-filled cysts .
In his office at the hospital , surgeon Sailike Duishanbai brandishes a jar containing a transparent sphere resembling a jellyfish , extracted from a brain of a patient with CE . An ethnic Kazakh , Duishanbai grew up in a herding family and knows the disease 's dangers . “ It is very common in nomadic ethnic groups , ” he says . “ It 's very expensive to treat . ”

Tang has alveolar echinococcosis ( AE ) , a rarer but more dangerous form of the disease with a mortality rate of more than 90 per cent . It is more dangerous in part because it has a longer incubation period , from five to 15 years , meaning patients may only be diagnosed decades after contracting it . More than 90 per cent of the world 's AE cases are thought to occur in China , resulting from rodents with the tapeworms that are found largely in this part of the world .
“ Alveolar is more difficult [ to operate on ] than cancer — it 's ‘ more stuck ' to vital structures in the brain , ” Duishanbai explains . One of the few members of his community to attend university , he now carries out cyst-removal operations , which can last for more than 11 hours . But he relishes the work he describes as “ very adventurous , risky ” .
Tang sits on a hospital bed while Duishanbai tests his reflexes . A crowd of onlookers gathers — the facility draws patients from across Xinjiang and its corridors are filled with women in bright headscarves and men wearing the square doppa hats that are common among the region 's Uighur ethnic group . The Uighurs are mostly Muslims with stronger historical links to central Asia than China .
Five years ago if there was a lesion like this , surgeons could do nothing
Xinjiang tends to hit global headlines following periodic clashes between security forces and the 10-million-strong Uighur population in which hundreds of people on both sides have been killed in recent years . As a result , security in Urumqi is tight , with mandatory checks on people and bags around public buildings . A few days ago , an “ anti-terror ” demonstration has taken place in the city involving 10,000 armed police .
None of that deters Wen Hao as he blithely waves his way past a guard clad in black and brandishing a shield and baton at the hospital 's entrance . He darts into a ward and places his hand on the shoulder of a 26-year-old CE patient who has recently received the hospital 's most advanced treatment , which Wen refers to ominously as “ radical resectioning ” — removing the liver whole and stripping it of cysts before replacing it .
“ Five years ago if there was a lesion like this , surgeons could do nothing . He would have died after one or two years , ” Wen says , beaming . “ It 's the only place in China with this technology. ” The patient 's mother is at her son 's bedside and bursts into tears : “ He 's better now , ” she sobs . “ Thanks so much . ”
Wen 's office is in a building built by the Soviet Union in the 1950s , when China 's recently victorious Communist party began moving members of the ethnic Han majority to Xinjiang in large numbers to secure the region . Doctors encountering the disease there made early efforts to treat it , but operations were crude , with surgeons sometimes puncturing cysts inside patient 's organs , unleashing floods of parasitic larvae .

The story of China 's modern treatment programme for echinococcosis follows an unlikely path to Xinjiang from north-west England . Wen Hao was a PhD student with Dr Philip Craig at Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine and later the University of Salford . Craig has had a celebrated career as a parasitologist , once even ingesting a tapeworm for an experiment ( he wrote soberly in a paper that “ abdominal discomfort [ peaked at ] around 15-19 weeks post-infection ” ) . In the 1980s , he was one of the first foreign researchers to chart the disease in China . “ We realised there was a big problem , ” he says .
Soon , scientists from several countries , including France and Japan , were being funded by international bodies , including the European Commission and the US National Institutes of Health , to measure the burden of the disease in China . A trip in the 1990s to a remote part of Gansu province revealed conditions resembling “ the middle ages in Europe ” , says Dominique Vuitton of the University of Franche-Comté in eastern France . “ It was the most neglected of neglected diseases . . . the burden was really not known , ” she says . “ Just the tip of the iceberg arose in the hospitals . ”
The burden was not really known — just the tip of the iceberg arose in the hospitals
Early infection figures shocked researchers , with rates of more than 10 per cent of the population in some counties . The researchers took their findings to central government officials in Beijing , eliciting government support starting in the early 2000s with funding for treatment with the drug albendazole , which was developed in the 1970s and can slow the growth of cysts .
Funding for operations also increased — to Rmb8,000 ( about $ 1,100 in today 's terms ) per patient nationwide , plus variable contributions from local government insurance schemes . Mass screening — through methods such as ultrasound scans that reveal cysts — showed how big a burden it could become on the Chinese healthcare system , Vuitton says . In the early 2000s , when China was being criticised for neglecting its western provinces , it was a way for central government to demonstrate it did actually care , she adds .
The cystic form of the disease was also present in the south of France , where Wen Hao was the first of several Chinese doctors to train with Vuitton 's team . He returned in the 1990s with a fondness for red wine and mastery of the latest surgical techniques . Just 20 years later , the team he leads in Urumqi is acknowledged to be the most advanced in the world .
In the past decade , China has rolled out the largest prevention programme ever created for the disease , including drug treatment for millions of dogs and vaccination for livestock . To test the results of the programme , thousands of canine stool samples are analysed each year in Urumqi . “ They keep the dog faeces here , ” researcher Zhang Wenbao says , pointing to a tall stainless steel freezer in the hospital 's lab . “ They are frozen for a week then tested . ”
Zhang admits the commercial imperatives for further drug development are small . “ How big is the market ? ” he asks . “ The market is poor people . We asked companies for investment and no one [ was ] interested . The big problem is investment . ”
Severe though the situation in Xinjiang might be , the heaviest burden of the disease is found on the Tibetan plateau . Both main varieties of echinococcosis are found in the region , spread by the Tibetans ' use of dogs to protect their yaks , large numbers of strays and lack of awareness about sanitation .
“ Getting up to the Tibetan plateau for the first time , it was pretty staggering — even more horrific for public health than what I 'd seen in Africa , ” says Craig . Beijing has funded treatment and dog drug schemes and , while progress has been made , he adds : “ I do n't think the control programme and the national programme are reaching Tibetan counties very well . ”

The hospital in Urumqi now sees dozens of Tibetan patients a year , including several Buddhist lamas . Aga , a Tibetan herder , was diagnosed seven years ago , but local hospitals were unable to remove his cysts . He says that the dog drug programmes have yet to reach his county in western Sichuan province 's remote Nagchu prefecture .
Looking at a scan of Aga 's torso is Shao Yingmei , a doctor who thinks nothing of downing six cans of energy drink during a 20-hour cyst-removal operation . Speaking in Mandarin , she reminds Aga of prevention methods such as not feeding dogs raw meat and the importance of hand-washing , as Aga stares uncomprehendingly . “ We try and find translators , ” she says , but the hospital has no Tibetan-language materials to distribute .
Aga 's trip was partly funded by government insurance and subsidies , but most will need to pay surgery fees equivalent to tens of thousands of yuan out of their pocket — a fortune for herders whose monthly income is likely to be in the hundreds . Stephanie Hua , a Tibetan charity worker who focuses on the disease , says that in most cases , patients are asked to pay half of their medical fees . “ If there is no help from the government it can bankrupt a family , ” says Hou Yanyan of the Xinjiang centre for disease control . “ There can be situations where the disease drives people into poverty . ”
The market is poor people . We asked companies for investment and no one [ was ] interested
The payment situation remains politically sensitive . When one patient 's wife begins to complain about lack of support , a doctor cuts her off . “ Do n't listen ! ” he says , shepherding reporters away .
In a mainly Tibetan region of Qinghai province in central China , locals say the dog drug programmes have been hampered by corruption , where funds allocated to the medication have been misappropriated . Sitting in his spartan concrete house close to the shores of Qinghai Lake , country doctor Ma Youqing raises his shirt to reveal a scar from an operation . “ I too got the disease , ” he says . Afterwards , pacing towards his herd of sheep and cows chewing on the stiff grass , he says he sold nearly half his animals to pay for the operation .
Public health researchers say the prospects of the disease disappearing from the Tibetan plateau are slim , given its vast size . “ All the successful elimination programmes have been island programmes , ” says Craig , citing New Zealand , Tasmania and Iceland as examples . “ What 's on the cards perhaps is county-level elimination . Until there is a [ human ] vaccine , transmission will still go on . ”
Lhamo Dolma , 39 , who lives a short drive away , says she was diagnosed with the disease three years ago but had had the illness for years . To pay for operations , one of which was to remove a red cyst she describes as “ like an apple ” from her stomach , she sold her entire flock of more than 100 sheep and is dependent on relatives . “ You can not work — you are too tired . I just stay in the house , ” she says . “ It 's a very bad disease ” .

Seventeen years on , one-club man John Muldoon reckons the “ gate ” at Connacht 's Saturday afternoon clash with Leinster should belong to him .
An endangered species in today 's professional sport , the legendary Pro12-winning captain farewells the Galway Sportsground where he has remained steadfast since joining the academy in 2001 . And that , he says , is his proudest achievement , if not the most lucrative .
“ Yeah , not the best payers here , ” Muldoon joked . “ Maybe if I was a little bit older I might have taken the French option , but it is what it is . ”
Having turned down offers from Ireland , England and France during his career , the Portumna-born backrow player still has no regrets .
“ Being a one-club man is one of my proudest achievements . I can rest easy at night and fall asleep knowing I have enjoyed myself the utmost in Connacht Rugby .
“ I 'm 35 years of age , and I probably have 30 odd years to make some money . I have memories with friends , with family , and the pride of where I am from which probably has affected my bank balance , but life is for living . If I was stuck in a house or an apartment in the south of France , and while I might have a great tan , I might have had huge regrets if I was not part of that day a couple of years ago .
Inspires
“ It would have killed me not to be part of a team that lifted the trophy [ Pro 12 ] , and while it is not the be-all and end-all of every success , it makes a difference . That is what inspires kids to play and pull on green jerseys in the future . ”
Muldoon , who made his professional debut against the Scottish Borders in 2003 , makes his 327th appearance on Saturday – still the most capped player in the Pro14 since making his 300th last April – also against Leinster . Having struggled through the “ darkest days ” with Connacht , it is Muldoon 's sense of place that has helped drive him on .
It is a tremendous accolade that people are coming out for a fond farewell , he 's been a true talisman for Connacht
“ It is probably my GAA background and pride of community . I still enjoy coming in every day . There is that sense of anticipation as the week goes on and it builds in the bottom of your gut , and when the lights come on here on a Friday or Saturday night , it is all worth it . It is something I will miss massively . ”
Muldoon , who is expecting his first child in three months , is joining former coach Pat Lam at newly-promoted Bristol as a defence coach , with the blessing of current coach Kieran Keane .
“ I spoke to KK [ Kieran Keane ] in November about it . I admire KK because he is straight down the middle , and I told him I was looking to get a coaching role outside Ireland . He said it would be a good option to break the cord for a while , experience a new league , different people .
“ It is a huge opportunity . Knowing Pat and Conor McPhillips will help , so it will make that transition a little bit easier . I am massively excited . It will be a huge couple of months for me , big changes , but it lessens the blow a small bit that while I am walking out of professionalism , I am going into the next best thing which is coaching rugby . ”
Find his feet
Before that , Muldoon will play his last game for his home club when Leinster roll up to a capacity crowd at the Sportsground fresh from their victory over Scarlets in the Champions Cup .
Connacht head coach Kieran Keane says it will be a great occasion for Muldoon , who has helped him “ find his feet ” in Ireland this season .
“ It is the celebration of an incredible life in rugby . A single club , 327 games , a hell of an achievement by anyone , and I think it is to be celebrated because you do n't often come across that .
“ It is a tremendous accolade that people are coming out for a fond farewell , he 's been a true talisman for Connacht . He has had 20 starts and four as a sub this season , so he 's played 24 of the 27 games which shows the resilience of this man at the tender age he is . ”
After a disappointing season , Connacht has the added incentive of claiming a first hat-trick of victories over the provinces at home .
Keane , however , says he wants his charges “ to do their very best , and to celebrate Muldoon with a performance of which they can be proud – win , lose or draw ” .
“ You do n't often get the opportunity to take on a big dog like Leinster and we were probably a little miffed we did n't get it in Dublin , so we have plenty to fight for and it will be a tough contest , and they will expect nothing less . ”
Blending designer with high street is an art beloved of celebrities like Alexa Chung , Olivia Palermo , Kate Middleton and Meghan Markle .
Not a new sartorial concept , the high-low formula is a well-known and effective dressing formula . But it 's not always so easily mastered . There 's dexterity required when it comes to skilfully engineering drastically different price points into a chic and cohesive ensemble .
Dress , €79.99 , H & M
These high-profile style mavens nonchalantly blend the budget with the blowout , the standard with the special , the luxe with the less . Most importantly , they know when to splurge and when to save .
Kate Middleton , in particular , started the royal high-low dressing with a statement of style intent when she wore a Reiss blouse in her engagement photos , and has since worn LK Bennett , Topshop and Zara .
You do n't need high-end everything to hit the right style notes and make a statement
Olivia Palermo and Alexa Chung have garnered their IT-girl status with their thrifty high-street-meets-designer outfits . Chung keeping to the fancy frock-frugal shoe adage and Palermo sticking to Zara and Topshop pieces masterfully punctuated with heavy-weight designers .
With the high street really upping the ante , churning out pieces that could rival designer , it proves that you do n't need high-end everything to hit the right style notes and make a statement . Instead , it 's all about creating that all-important balance between looking stylish and not trying too hard .

Realistically , dressing in designer duds every day is a luxury only some people can afford . The reality for most is the opposite scenario – a wardrobe based on high street buys , with a selection of specially nurtured luxurious pieces that add instant polish . But , with celebrities and the fashion set all gravitating towards the high-low mix , it becomes less cookie-cutter and makes getting dressed all that bit more exciting and unique .
On-trend items
For fashion fads or seasonally trending items , consider saving your money and going with a high street item . It 's a good way of trying out a trend , and if you happen to wear it on repeat , then you can invest in a high-end version of it . But do seek out quality high street pieces , it must be able to carry off style with designer pieces and not fall flat , make sure it wo n't tear or rip easily .
It 's all about mixing and matching items that co-ordinate , irrelevant of the price tag
Take a style cue from Meghan Markle , blending budgets when she attended the wedding of Prince Harry 's cousin Celia McCorquodale , pairing a floral Oscar de la Renta dress costing close to €5,000 with a headpiece from Marks and Spencer that retails at just €35 . Markle 's occasion outfit also proves that there 's no steadfast rules when it comes to the high-low equation . Marks and Spencer with Oscar de la Renta ? Chanel and Topshop ? Prada and Penneys ? Why not ? It 's all about mixing and matching items that co-ordinate , irrelevant of the price tag .
Accessories
Accessories are always a sound investment and will get you long-term mileage . For a fail-safe dressing formula : think one high-end item per outfit to heighten the rest . This is where the designer accessory comes into its own with a little bit of distraction technique .
Bag , €995 , Gucci
When you 've a designer bag slung from your arm , no one will know the rest of your outfit is last season Marks and Spencer . Of course , a bag does n't have to be your choice of high-end arsenal – a designer belt , scarf , jewellery or shoes will all add that pzazz . Markle , too , uses to elevate formula , most recently when she wore a high street green floral Self Portrait dress mixed effortlessly with a Roland Mouret bag and Alexander McQueen blazer .

More on outerwear
It is also worth spending more on outerwear , as Markle does too . It 's generally on rotation in your wardrobe for six months of the year and every season to come , and this applies to menswear too . Whether it 's a lightweight trench , a structured blazer or heavy-duty winter coat , ensure they 're high-quality , durable and will add a jolt to the most basic of outfits .

With the sales in full swing , shop smart to score some savvy designer steals that will boost your basics . With high-end sale items , you do n't just have to stick to neutral shades or fail-safe black , you can invest in a fun bright hue or embellished pieces , just make sure you will wear it on multiple occasions and can style it up straight away with what you have in your wardrobe .

Growth in the Republic 's services sector rose to a five month high in June , driven by stronger client demand and improved optimism , according to the latest Investec PMI report .
Like the manufacturing PMI on Monday , Wednesday 's Investec Services PMI Ireland report shows the rate of growth in activity has improved to a five month high of 59.5 . This is up from May 's 59.3 reading . A mark of 50 separates growth from contraction .
The improvement was driven by stronger client demand , with the new business index reversing almost all of the moderation seen in the previous month .
This appears to have been mainly driven by domestic clients , as the rate of expansion in new export business cooled slightly in June , although the UK and US were cited by some respondents as sources of new demand .
Irish Services companies responded to the increased demand by adding to headcounts at the fastest pace seen in 2018 so far , but despite these additional resources the sequence of growth in outstanding business extended into its 61st month in June .
On the margin side , there was another sharp rise in input costs in June , with higher energy , insurance and salary costs said by panellists to be behind this .
Firms were , however , able to pass on at least some of this increase by upping output prices once again .
Regardless , the profitability index was little changed in the three months to end-June from May 's report , with the sequence of above-50 readings now stretching to 20 survey periods .
The forward looking business expectations index strengthened in June , pointing to greater optimism by services companies .
“ Allied to the increase in employment growth to the fastest pace in the year to date , it is clear that Irish services companies are upbeat on the prospects for the sector , ” said Investec economist Philip O'Sullivan .
“ Given the positive international backdrop , we share this optimism . ”

That followed fresh threats against North Korea on Friday , when Trump declared the U.S. military was `` locked and loaded '' and warned North Korean leader Kim Jong-un that he `` will regret it fast '' if he takes any action against U.S. territories or allies .
WALL STREET LAST WEEK : Gains among technology companies helped snap a three-day losing streak for U.S. stocks Friday , though the market ended with its worst weekly loss since March .

EAST BRIDGEWATER , Mass . ( AP ) — Two sisters tied down and burned a 5-year-old girl , permanently disfiguring her , in a voodoo ritual meant to rid her of a demon causing her to misbehave , police said . The women also threatened to cut off the head of the girl 's 8-year-old brother with a machete , authorities said .
The boy said his sister was tied down on at least two occasions while the sisters blew fire over her face and cut her on the arm and in the collar area with a needle-like object , drawing blood , according to police . The girl said the women also poured over her eyes a substance that stung .
Peggy LaBossiere , 51 , and Rachel Hilaire , 40 , of East Bridgewater , denied injuring the girl and threatening the boy , the Brockton Enterprise reported . They pleaded not guilty on Jan. 29 to mayhem , assault and other charges . A public defender for the women did n't return a call seeking comment on Saturday .
Police say the girl 's mother is a hair stylist of Haitian descent who has LaBossiere as a client and requested the ritual . She has not been charged but is receiving mental health treatment .

The sisters will be back in Brockton Superior Court on Wednesday for a hearing to determine whether they 're too dangerous to be released .
The sisters told police that they have performed `` cleansing baths '' for family and friends in the past , something that involves chanting prayers , rubbing frankincense and eucalyptus oils and sea salt on their bodies , and burning myrrh , the newspaper reported . Children sometimes get burned as spirits leave the body , they said .
The girl suffered a third-degree burn across her face that will leave her permanently disfigured , police said . She was treated at a hospital and taken into custody by state welfare authorities , along with her brother , who described to police what happened at the sisters ' house over multiple days .
Voodoo refers to religious practices developed centuries ago by enslaved Africans in the Caribbean , primarily in Haiti , where the practices are sometimes spelled `` vodou . ''

After the meeting between K.P . Sharma Oli and Indian Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj , it seems that misunderstanding between CPN-UML and India is over .
“ We have a very cordial meeting with Indian minister and delegation . We discussed all the issues and misunderstanding , ” said CPN-UML leader Prdeep Gyawali to the reporter .
The minister also congratulated the UML for its resounding victory in the recently held parliamentary and provincial assembly polls , according to UML Secretary Pradip Gyawali , who was present at the meeting .
“ Chairman Oli conveyed that he was in favor of working closely with neighbors including India for peace and prosperity in the country . He also said that he wanted to take everybody along to achieve these ends , ” Gyawali told media persons after the dinner meeting .
External affairs minister Sushma Swaraj met the Left alliance leader and CPN-UML chairman K P Sharma Oli , who is likely to be the next prime minister of Nepal .
Oli called on Swaraj at Hotel Soaltee.Visiting Indian External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj , who arrived in Kathmandu on a goodwill visit on Thursday , conveyed the message of Prime Minister Narendra Modi that he is eager to work closely with the CPN UML-led government .
During a one-on-one meeting with UML Chairman K P Sharma Oli and a group meeting held with senior UML leaders on Thursday evening , Minister Swaraj said that Prime Minister Modi was happy over the clear mandate received by the UML-led leftist alliance .
Minister Swaraj is accompanied by newly-appointed Foreign Secretary Vijay Gokhale , Joint Secretary ( North ) Sudhakar Dalela and other senior officials of the External Affairs Ministry . She was received by State Minister for Finance Udaya SJB Rana at the airport .
Minister Swaraj went directly to Hotel Soaltee Crown Plaza , where she had a one-on-one meeting with CPN-UML Chairman K P Sharma Oli for over 45 minutes and a 45-minute group meeting with senior UML leaders .
Chairman Oli was accompanied by senior UML leaders including General Secretary Ishwar Pokharel , Secretary Pradip Gyawali , Subash Nembang , Rajan Bhattarai , Bishnu Rimal and Yubaraj Khatiwada .
Minister Swaraj , who is staying at the Soaltee , held a group meeting with presidium members of the Rastriya Janata Party Nepal ( RJPN ) after the dinner reception . She is scheduled to hold a meeting with CPN ( Maoist Center ) Chairman Pushpa Kamal Dahal and call on Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba and President Bidya Devi Bhandari before flying back home Friday afternoon .
The visit of Minister Swaraj without any specific agenda this time is widely seen as New Delhi 's overtures to improve its difficult relations with the CPN-UML , which is set to form the new government , and to reset ties between the two countries . Relations between Nepal and India reached a new low during the premiership of UML Chairman Oli following the promulgation of the new constitution .
`` The visit is in keeping with the tradition of regular high-level political exchanges between India and Nepal , and reflects the expanding bilateral partnership and the importance that the two countries attach to further strengthening it across diverse sectors , '' read a press statement issued by the Ministry of External Affairs of India .
The visit will provide an opportunity for the minister to hold discussions with political leaders of Nepal on issues of mutual interest , and to advance age-old , special ties of friendship between the two countries , the Indian ministry added .

Rescue workers cleared mud and debris from a landslide at a giant rubbish dump in the Sri Lankan capital for a fourth day on Monday , as the death toll rose to 29 and uncertainty remained over the number of people missing .
The 300-foot-high ( 90-metre ) dump in the Meethotamulla area on the border of the commercial heart of Colombo collapsed after flames engulfed it late on Friday , the country 's official New Year 's day , burying many homes .
Military spokesman Roshan Senivirathna said that rescue workers will have to dig deeper to recover the dead but that they have no idea how many people may still be missing .
“ The hill came down in quite a strong manner where in some areas we had to dig up to 20 feet , and in some areas it might be little further . Depending on the information we get from the people .. we can continue our process , ” he told Reuters .
Residents still say around 100 people may be missing , but the state-run Disaster Management Centre ( DMC ) revised down its own figure for the missing to 11 from an initial 30 .
Both the military spokesman and a DMC official said the death toll had reached 29 .
Pradeep Kodippili , a spokesman for the DMC , said the number of missing was revised down after going through information on the area residents from government offices .
“ Some of the dead people 's names were in the missing list and we removed those names , ” Kodippili told Reuters .
The authorities have ordered a stop to garbage dumping at the nearest site , the largest in the country , where 800 tons of waste is dumped on a daily basis , mainly from Colombo city .
The finance ministry is considering compensation for the victim 's families and for those whose houses were damaged in the landslide .
The rescue team of more than 1,000 military personnel halted the search late on Monday and expected to resume on Tuesday .
Already officials have said survival was “ very unlikely ” .
The police are investigating whether the landslide was natural or man-made .
Residents of the area , mostly living in shanties , had been demanding the removal of the dump , saying it was causing health problems . The government had said it would remove it as part of an infrastructure plan .

Video game fans can be an entitled bunch . When they latch onto a popular series or genre it is n't long before they begin demanding the next iteration meet certain criteria and levels of excellence . But game companies do n't always give fans what they want , and many times the most invested players can have a difficult time accepting this reality .
When Nintendo and the Pokémon Company announced their plans to release Let 's Go Pikachu and Let 's Go Eevee mere weeks before E3 , the internet was set ablaze . Here was the generation one console reboot longtime fans had been wanting for years and years , but it was n't quite what they had hoped for . With simplified controls and tweaked gameplay it was obvious the Let 's Go titles were crafted for a younger audience , or those who were new to the series .
Despite Pokémon Company CEO and president Tsunekazu Ishihara stating various times that the Let 's Go games were not the next main series entries , and that said entries were coming in late 2019 , there were still plenty of players crying , “ This was n't what we wanted ! ”

Seeing the hostility towards the Let 's Go games reminded me of a personal reaction to a Pokémon spin-off that took place nearly 20 years ago .

In the Spring of 1999 the initial Pokémon fever still had its claws in the deepest reaches of my overactive nine year-old mind . My friends and I had read about Pokémon Snap in the months leading up to its late June release by way of Nintendo Power magazine . It was the first official Pokémon game for the Nintendo 64 — that was all the incentive we needed to put it at the top of our list . In fact , I made the decision to purchase Snap in place of the hotly anticipated Super Smash Bros. For a kid whose only income was a meager allowance and the occasional birthday check , I knew buying any game was a serious investment .

It was n't like Nintendo Power was pulling the wool over our eyes by promoting Pokémon Snap as anything other than a first-person photography game . Even my prepubescent brain could comprehend that the game would focus on moving through environments and snapping pictures of wild Pokémon . But part of me hoped they were burying the lede . That there was a secret surprise mode or feature that Nintendo did n't want to spoil ahead of the game 's release . Maybe you could catch the Pokémon , battle them , and level them up . Something , anything besides taking pictures .

Of course , as we soon found out , taking pictures was all there was to Pokémon Snap .
As my group of friends and I played through this newest Pokémon game over the first few days of July we began to express our overall disappointment with the content , or lack thereof . It was slow . It was short . Heck , it did n't even feature all of the Pokémon from the first two games . We became the outraged fans all agreeing , “ This was n't what we wanted ! ”

But we were also children , and most of us had broken the bank to add Pokémon Snap to our game library , so we kept playing . Weeks later , after dozens of Pokémon had been perfectly framed , I convinced my mother to take me to the local Blockbuster , where one could print off their favorite pictures from the game at a special Pokémon Snap station . A novel idea at the time , and by far my fondest memory of the game .
I 've gone back to Pokémon Snap on a few rare occasions over the last twenty years . Every time I do , I find something new to love .
It is a rather slow affair , but it was obviously designed as such . The game wants players to have time to check their surroundings and take everything in . The rustling of a Meowth slinking through the foliage or the splash of a Poliwag diving into a nearby river . I realized that Pokémon Snap was providing an aspect of this fantastical world the original games never had — witnessing Pokémon in their natural environments . Red and Blue 's top-down view never truly portrayed Pokémon in the wild . It hid them away within the tall grass of Viridian Forest or the dark corners of Mt . Moon . Pokémon Snap was all about giving players a less stressful look into the world of Pokémon . An interactive field trip of sorts .

Though Snap 's Pokémon Island only consists of seven areas , each has a distinctive theme and soothing soundtrack , featuring Pokémon not seen elsewhere in the game ( aside from Pikachu , who rightly shows up everywhere ) . The areas are detailed , and well designed to keep the player 's head on swivel .
Getting Pokémon to pose in a certain way , or appear in general , can take some experimenting with the game 's various items . In this way Pokémon Snap expertly mixes quick thinking and action , becoming more of a puzzle game than a simple photo shoot . Thinking critically about how Pokémon will react to elements like food and music allows players to strategize their shots , and get the most out to each level . Younger fans ( such as myself twenty years ago ) might not have the patience to sit through the slow rolling levels over and over , but players who do n't mind the ride can find plenty of new or slightly altered content in each go .

Something far less important that I discovered while researching the game was that , although players were able to rename the main photographer , his official full name was Todd Snap . The protagonist of Pokémon Snap ... is Todd Snap . A detail so silly and terribly on-the-nose that it somehow manages to add another small layer of charm to the game 's already somewhat laughable storyline .
Pokémon Snap 's photography-based gameplay was distinctive for its time , and years later there sadly has n't been another Pokémon game quite like it . In the grand scheme of things , as a part of the most profitable media franchise of all time , the game is just a blip on the radar . It wo n't be remembered as the best Pokémon spin-off , or the worst , but it will certainly go down as one of the most unique . A relaxing change of pace for any Pokémon fan who was weary of the main series RPG grind .

MDC Alliance parliamentary candidate for Mbizo constituency , Settlement Chikwinya , yesterday described President Emmerson Mnangagwa as a sly politician who pretended to promote peace , yet he maintained a firm grip on the State media and the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission ( Zec ) to disadvantage his rivals .
Chikwinya claimed that the State media was still dominated by Zanu PF broadcasts , adding that several electoral rules were being flouted .
“ The Mnangagwa dispensation has approached his rule in two parts : which are hardcore and softcore issues , and the softcore issues are to do with that there should be minimum or no violence during elections , where he is saying that I am a good leader , Zimbabwe is open for business , and I have withdrawn my previous deeds of beating up people , yet we all know that he is the culprit that used to unleash violence , ” he said .
“ The hardcore issues are that he has maintained a grip on State media , and even though they covered the MDC Alliance manifesto launch , we can not compare it to the coverage that he is allotted together with his wife Auxillia , who even appears on television buying tomatoes . What it means is that Mnangagwa has 27 days to rectify issues and ensure there are credible elections in accordance with Sadc and African Union norms . ”
Chikwinya lashed out at sitting legislator Vongaishe Mupereri ( Zanu PF ) , saying he lacked political clout to effectively represent the constituency .
“ Mupereri has been in Parliament only to register his name and he never uttered a word in Parliament . It is high time people recall him and put a true representative of the people because I set a high bar for him during my tenure , ” he said .
Chikwinya promised several projects for the people of Mbizo in line with MDC Alliance presidential candidate Nelson Chamisa 's Sustainable and Modernisation Agenda for Real Transformation ” ( Smart ) programme .
Some of them , he said , include renovation of single quarters in Mbizo , where families are overcrowded , and establishing a new clinic .
Chikwinya said donors already pledged to support the projects given his good record during his tenure as MP . Newsday

This was in response to difficulties being reported by some secondary schools in hiring qualified substitute teachers across subjects such as maths , science and languages .
Dr Seán Rowland of Hibernia said the approach was not a replacement for teachers , but had potential to ease difficulties facing students and school principals .
Discipline
“ So , we get a good teacher of maths in Cork , she 's fully qualified and we live stream her to a classroom in Galway to teach maths , ” he said . “ You have to make sure it 's quality , that the class is productive , that there is discipline and that it is supervised and fulfils the requirement of the Teaching Council . everything has to apply except the teacher is on the other side of the camera . ”
Dr Rowland was speaking at a meeting of the Oireachtas committee on education on Tuesday , which examined the impact of teacher shortages in some subject areas .
However , proposals to extend the practice of remote teaching to ease the teacher supply “ crisis ” drew sharp criticism from a teachers ' union and some TDs .
Joanne Irwin of the Teachers ' Union of Ireland said while the approach might work among “ highly motivated students in south Dublin ” , many schools were trying to ensure students arrived in school in the first place .
Sinn Féin TD Kathleen Funchion said such a move was “ completely unacceptable ” and that difficulties hiring teachers in some subjects was down to two-tier pay scales across the profession .
However , Independent Senator Lynn Ruane said the proposal had merit in cases where no qualified teachers were available for students .
She said her own daughter did not have access to an Irish teacher for three months and live streaming was better than having no teacher at all .
Dr Rowland asked that members have an open mind and to see the pilot projects in action before dismissing them outright .
Dean of DCU 's institute of education Dr Anne Looney said that having a qualified teacher in the classroom was “ by far and away ” the best solution . But she said there was merit to schools collaborating and partnering to sharing teaching resources . Some schools , she said , shared teachers in subjects such as physics .
Threat
The Joint Managerial Body ( JMB ) , the largest secondary school management body , said it was grateful that teacher shortages were being addressed in a “ serious manner ” and had been accepted as a “ genuine threat to the education of our young people ” . However , Fr Paul Connell of the JMB said a number of other steps are needed to tackle the issue .
He said pay rates for retired teachers needed to be improved , while a five-day limit on the use of unregistered teachers was a “ disincentive ” to potential substitute staff .
Student teachers in the second year of their post-graduate qualification should also be awarded conditional registration status and allowed to take classes on a paid basis .

Let 's keep this simple : Total War : Warhammer was a very good strategy game . Total War : Warhammer 2 is better .
The game continues Creative Assembly 's tradition of building on the release of a new Total War with a sort of semi-sequel . In the past we 've seen a bunch of these , from Napoleon ( following Empire ) to Attila ( following Rome 2 ) , releases that are kinda pitched as full sequels , but which players can quickly tell still have a lot in common with the game they 're following , from unit rosters to the menus .
Only this time TWW2 almost does feel like an all-new game . There 's just so much going on here , so much to separate it from its predecessor , from some enjoyable new races to a map that already ranks as one of Total War 's best .
Where the first game was set in the Old World , dominated by The Empire , TWW2 takes place in Warhammer 's New World , a completely fresh area where the human presence is limited to some pirates and colonists . Instead , the focus here is on four new races : the High Elves , Dark Elves , Lizardmen and Skaven .
Every single one of these are cool . The Elves are reasonably conventional but expensive and strong as hell . The Lizardmen are ferocious and fun . And the Skaven are a blast , able to scurry about underground and hide their settlements .
The goal in the first Warhammer Total War was to hold off a massive Chaos invasion that would sweep in from the north of the map . That was a novel idea , and at some times for some factions ( like my own review game as The Empire ) it worked ! Other times and in other spots of the map however it was less effective ; I played a game as the Dwarfs once where the Chaos were stopped by the AI before they even reached my lands .
In TWW2 that 's gone , and we have a new endgame . Which also happens to be the beginning and middle of the game as well . How ? The map ( and story itself ) is dominated by the opening of a giant magical vortex . Each faction is trying to interact with this vortex in some way , and this is done by performing a series of rituals throughout the campaign .
To start one , you need to accrue a certain type of currency from territories you hold , and then to actually perform one you need to protect a selection of your cities from enemy attack for a certain number of turns while magic swirls from their buildings into the vortex . Complete one ritual and you can move on to the next , so if nothing else they serve as a handy yardstick as to how the game is progressing ( letting you easily see who is “ winning ” at any one time ) .
While you 're trying to perform rituals the other major factions are as well , and this is where the strategy of TWW2 is flipped on its head . See , the campaign here does n't care how many territories you hold or how many armies you 've slain . It only cares about the rituals .
So the old steamroller approach to Total War games , where all you care about is taking over more and more of the map , has been tossed out the window . Instead , we see here the crusading/raiding influence of the first Warhammer 's most enjoyable expansion races ( Bretonnia and Norscaa ) , as players are now encouraged to ditch massive invasions in favour of surgical strikes .
If another faction is beginning a ritual and you want to stop it—something that will happen in a close game , lest the AI get ahead of you—you have two options : you could spend a load of cash and basically summon an army right at their doorstop ( there 's a whole button devoted just to this ) , or you could send in a precision strike with your own units . Each ritual only lasts a handful of turns , so you probably wo n't have time to launch a full-scale invasion of a rival 's entire territory ; instead you need to get in , strike hard , smash the place up then get out .
This throws a lot of established Total War strategy in the trash , and I love it . The challenge runs both ways , too : you have to worry about defending your own rituals while they 're taking place , which are sometimes in cities spread out across the map , forcing you to think a lot more about the placement of your armies than just rushing everyone to the front .
The rituals definitely help alleviate one of Total War 's longest-running problems , which has been pacing , as older games tend to start well enough , ramp up into epic confrontations then fade out over the second half of the game into a dull slog . Here , the game feels more like a race than a fight , with factions constantly jockeying for the lead in the rush to perform their rituals first .
Helping with both the feeling of freshness and aiding the new crusading strategy is the new world map , which is not only huge , but also super interesting to poke around . It 's divided into continents separated by large oceans ; playing as the High Elves located in the centre , for example , you may never encounter the Vampires or Dwarfs at all , and the vast distances between each land really add to the sense of adventure ( and remoteness ) you feel striking out across the seas to attack an enemy .
As for the rest of the game , well , for all the new stuff on show this is still technically a Total War quasi-sequel . So you 'll find many of the same races and units hanging around the fringes of the map , the same user interface , the same hero RPG focus , even the same narrator .
This of course means that there are till some of the same old Total Warproblems as well . Diplomatic AI is still drunk , and a quirk from the first Warhammer—where foes would bamboozle themselves by declaring war on me , never attacking then offering me thousands in gold to sign a peace treaty—was very much still present in TWW2 .
Worst of all , the first Warhammer 's load times as you jump between the strategic and tactical maps are still an issue . Unless you have an SSD they are excruciating , measured in whole minutes . They 're so bad that as my campaign wore on I found myself simulating more and more battles just to avoid the delays .
In my review of the first Warhammer , I mentioned how aside from releasing a fantastic strategy game , Creative Assembly had somehow managed to get me interested in Warhamme lore . They 've done it again here ; I had zero knowledge of any of these factions going into this game , but by the end I 'd grown so fond of my very serious but lethal High Elves that I was having trouble saying goodbye to them and their beautiful little spot on the map ( which as you can see above is just gorgeous , though the entire map is far prettier this time around than the more muted tones of the first game ) .
In doing so , I 've also been won over on the idea of these half-sequels . Warhammer 2 might have a lot in common with the first game , but everything it has done to set itself apart is big and fresh and daring , making this a game that 's worthy of its own place in the spotlight .
Heck , the sun is shining and the sky is blue . As Ken 's uncle Frankie used to say , “ You do n't know how good you feel , until you get sick. ” And I have some sort of bug . I rarely get sick . Do n't often miss my shows for health reasons and while , on paper , I 'm a walking pre-existing condition , I 'm pretty robust day-to-day . I know because of how I usually feel , that I should be very thankful . I 'm also very glad that folks have been really nice to me , knowing that I do n't feel great .
Which brings me to this musing . We do n't know how folks feel , unless they tell us , or exhibit other signs of how they are feeling .
It makes me realize as we head into the holidays how important it is that we do n't assume to know how folks are feeling . Heck , maybe they are feeling top notch , or maybe they are n't doing so well . Stuff is going on , they are being affected by the news of the day , or some other thing . And it 's the holiday season , a time that can be challenging for some folks .
I certainly do n't need to tell anyone else what to do , but I 'm going to take extra care to be patient around folks and not assume by appearances that I know how someone is feeling . I 'm also not going to pry . Just try to be as kind as possible and hope that it is reciprocated by others .
We have some fun KWMR events coming up , and I certainly hope to see you at one or more of them . If I extend my elbow , rather than my hand , it 's just because I 'm trying to stay healthy .

Ed Sheeran will guest star in the upcoming season of `` Game of Thrones . ''
The show 's producers made the announcement Sunday night during a panel discussion at the South by Southwest festival in Texas .
Producer David Benioff told the audience that they 've been trying to get the 26-year-old British singer a spot on the show for years to surprise Sheeran fan Maisie Williams , who plays Arya Stark on the HBO fantasy drama .
The seventh season of `` Game of Thrones '' premieres on HBO July 16 .
Peter Cvjetanovic , a student at the University of Reno Nevada , attended the 'Unite the Right ' rally , but said he 's not a racist . ( FOX5 )
On Saturday , hundreds gathered for the 'Unite the Right Rally ' at the University of Virginia . They were there protesting the removal of a Robert Lee Statue , the Confederate general during the Civil War . Peter Cvjetanovic , a student at the University of Reno Nevada , attended the rally , but said he 's not a racist .
`` I was filled with emotion and passion , it was a mob mentality . Really that is just an unfortunately timed photograph , '' that 's how Peter Cvjetanovic described the viral photo of him , torch in hand , marching with white nationalists in Charlottesville Virginia .
`` I do not identify as a racist , I identify as an identitarian , '' he said .
As an identitarian , Peter said he believes that in the future , there may be no more white people ; something he does not want to happen .
`` I fear that with mass immigration where you can go anywhere and live anywhere , certain races will be out-bred . ''
He said he is not a white nationalist who believes that white people are somehow superior . He did admit he marched alongside Klansmen and Nazis but said he did not participate in any anti-Semitic chants .
Cvjetanovic returned to Reno and said friends and family have been reaching out and supporting him , but that this past weekend changed his life .
`` Both sides have blood on their hands . Their side is he one threatening me and my family , and the people who claim to be tolerant and claim to love all people . They are threatening me and hurting my friends and that is not acceptable . ''
An online petition is asking UNR to expel Cvjetanovic but on Monday the school said it has no plans to do that . He said he was never worried that he would be expelled .
`` I hope they understand we have the right to speak . ''

As fans are praying for Willie Nelson 's quick recovery , they fear what is to come .
Billboard reported that 84-year-old Nelson had to cut his concert short on Sunday night because he was experiencing breathing problems . He was only in the beginning parts of his show when he exited the stage during the performance at the USANA Amphitheatre in Salt Lake City , Utah .
Worried fans were relieved to find out that their idol was doing much better via a Twitter post :
This year there have been numerous rumors about the state of Willie Nelson 's health ; especially because he has had no choice but to cancel a number of tour dates due to a peculiar illness that he never revealed to the public .
“ I got up two or three times in the last couple of years and read the paper where I 'd passed away , so I just wanted to let 'em know that 's a lot of horses–t ” Nelson has previously said .
The best thing we can do right now is keep Willie in our thoughts and prayers !

Thousands of concert-goers enjoyed a ‘ glorious ' two-day musical spectacular in a stunning Sutton Coldfield beauty spot last weekend .
The second outing of the Concerts in the Park in the wooded-amphitheatre of Boldmere Recreation Field in Sutton Park returned on June 30 and July 1 , with visitors enjoying classical music in bright sunshine and scorching temperatures .
The event , organised by Royal Sutton Coldfield Town Council , was again headlined by the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra whose full ensemble wowed a packed crowd on Saturday night . They were ably supported by Down for the Count and Ex Cathedra choir on Saturday , with a mini-CBSO orchestra returning on Sunday alongside Saturday 's choral stars and a host of community choirs .
( Image : Richard T Harris )
Cllr Simon Ward , leader of Royal Sutton Coldfield Town Council , hailed the event as a resounding success . He said : “ I thought it was an absolutely glorious weekend . Absolutely brilliant .
“ Saturday was a real day out . We opened the gates earlier and put more on for people . There were more support acts and they played for longer , creating a quality of product reflecting the increased ticket price .
“ Everyone has been hugely positive about the whole experience . It showcased Sutton Park and showcased Birmingham 's Symphony Orchestra – at a price that was half what people would usually pay .
“ Sunday was absolutely brilliant with a mixture of choirs – and a really great mix of music . It was just a great feeling .
“ There was a real mixture of people . There was absolutely no trouble or misbehaviour at any stage .
“ The concerts were a wonderful , memorable weekend and have become firmly cemented in Sutton 's calendar of events . ”
The CBSO 's full orchestra played popular classical music from Strauss , Brahms and Tchaikovsky , to show songs like The Lady is a Tramp by Richard Rodgers and West Side Story 's Mambo by Leonard Bernstein , and Frank Loesser 's Luck Be A Lady from Guys and Dolls on Saturday in Sutton Park 's seemingly purpose-made concert setting .

Opera music like Georges Bizet 's Suite No . 1 from Carmen and even a second attempt of the day to get the heavens to open with Nacio Herb Brown 's Singin ' in the Rain , a trick to cool down from the baking 28 degree temperatures attempted by Ex Cathedra – on both attempts to no avail , although those with brollies did get up , wave them around and dance !
The first evening culminated with Elgar 's Pomp and Circumstance , March No.1 , Sir Hubert Parry 's Jerusalem , with the crowd on their feet and waving Union Jacks – part excitement and part alcohol-fuelled no doubt - and an encore of the Jacques Offenbach 's Infernal Galop better known as the Can-can .

TV presenter Josie d'Arby hosted Saturday evening 's events , but if anything was a little stilted .
Earlier in the day Down for the Count got things underway with some fabulous swing music including Jeepers Creepers , before Ex Cathedra took to the stage with some evocative and enchanting choral vocals – which gave the illusion of stepping into an ancient church , but set in the blazing sunshine . They were pitch perfect .
As the audience heated up , so did the music , stepping up a beat in the early evening when Down for the Count returned to the stage playing Motown song 's which got the audience up dancing .
While Saturday 's atmosphere was charged with energy and late on exuberance – Sunday had a more chilled out vibe .
Partly with its family community feel , a host of local choirs on stage , punctuating the CBSO 's mini-orchestra and Ex Cathedra 's energetic SingMakers – who encouraged children to join in – and in part too due to reduced numbers .
( Image : Richard T Harris )
While tickets were snapped up in three days , it appears not everyone showed up for the Family Woodland Concert on Sunday , with gaps in the recreation field ( albeit that made it more relaxed and spacious for those that did attend ) . A shame because they missed a treat .
The CBSO 's mini-orchestra played music aimed at a younger audience , with classic tunes from Disney songs that were instantly recognisable . It was a packed programme on Sunday , with a constant flow of groups on stage from Magic Voices to Ex Cathedra SingMakers , the Tuneless Choir – who made up with enthusiasm what they may have missed in pitch perfect delivery – and the Falcon Lodge Choir .

The music kept flowing on Sunday with Sutton Coldfield Community Choir and the Singing Community of Choirs showing Sutton to be a choral hive of singers .
The day was compared by the effervescent Daz Hale from BBC WM – who kept the audience engaged with plenty of interaction and humour .
Later on Sunday Access Creative College gave the premiere of Harmonious Generations , written and performed by Pøgman .
While the Sutton Rock Choir concluded proceedings .
As well as stand-out music , both days included some delectable food and drink offerings . Simpsons Gin Bar sold out of Pimms on Saturday , while Cart and Carriage had tasty ice-creams and alcoholic ice pops . Street food award winner , Baked in Brick were back this year as was the Tipple Truck – a fire engine dousing the audience with hosefuls of beer , wine and cider !
Boldmere Deli , Phat Salads from Cornerstone Kitchen , Chiqui 's Churros and Mister V 's burgers made up the food offerings .
But with temperatures soaring the drinks outlets including , Aperitivo Prosecco and Simply Prosecco , did brisk business .
A woodland area at the back of the recreation field – which served as a place for concertgoers to cool down each day , on Sunday also became the setting for a second stage in the acoustic tent , where storytelling and poetry were showcased . The area also featured a silent disco and a second Creation Station children 's arts and crafts area – the first being under an awning which on Saturday had been used by sponsors Punter Southall .
The event was supported financially by Sutton 's taxpayers through their precept payments , Sutton Coldfield Charitable Trust , Punter Southall Financial Management , Sutton Coldfield College , Simpson 's Gin Bar and Royal Sutton Coldfield Chamber of Commerce .
In total there were 117 professional and 514 community performers across the weekend , enjoyed by thousands of visitors . Bravo ! And bring on Concerts in the Park Part III… ..
5 Tips to Help You Feel Your Best with Less Holiday Stress

Second year medicine students in University College Dublin ( UCD ) will have to resit an exam that was “ compromised ” as similar past papers of the test were circulated among students .
Student representatives from the class were told at a meeting with the faculty that around 230 students out of approx 300 that took the test received an A grade , according to the University Observer student newspaper . The module ‘ PHYS20050 Cell-Cell Communication ' was taken my medicine , biomedical science , and physiology students .
The exam was “ compromised ” as a version of the test from another year was circulated among the class before they sat the exam . In most courses past papers from previous years are available to students , but in the specific medicine module they are not made available by the school .
The multiple choice exam , which students took before Christmas , was worth 100 per cent of the grade for the module . When UCD students received their results from the first semester of classes last month , students in the class were informed they would have to retake the exam .
It is understood the past paper circulated among students sitting the exam this December was very similar to the test they took .
A senior source in the university said they were “ aware ” of the issue with the exam , and the process of dealing with the matter had been started by the relevant school .
“ The system identifies when something is compromised ... when you have a bell curve shifting like that in one direction , it 's raised and looked at , ” the source said .
Speaking to the University Observer , a third year medicine student said she provided a friend taking the course this year with a copy of the multiple choice exam she sat previously .
“ This year , someone in the year below me asked my friend for the notes she had for Cell-Cell and since my friend knew I had the questions and answers from sitting the repeat she asked me for them . I gave them to her to pass on and I told her to encourage them to pass them to everyone in their year and they did ” the student said .
The module coordinator , Associate Professor John Baugh , was not available for comment at the time of publication .
The exam itself was made up of several questions which each had five multiple choice options , and no negative marking if students answered incorrectly .
Students will now have to resit the test at the next opportunity during the summer period of exams at the end of the college year .

Newcastle United are prepared to smash their transfer record to bring Salomon Rondon to the club .
Reports in the North East claim the West Brom striker is Rafael Benitez 's main target - but that Stoke could be a contender for his signature .
The Venezuela international is available for £16.5m due a release clause in his contract and he has also been linked to Besiktas .
Chronicle Live say they Turkish club 's interest has stalled and that the demands of Rondon and his agent will see the deal go beyond £20m .
Newcastle 's record transfer fee is the £16m they paid for Michael Owen in 2005 , which surpassed the £15m that brought Alan Shearer to St James ' Park nearly a decade earlier .
Rondon has been at Albion for the last three seasons and has scored 24 Premier League goals .
Fans react
West Bromwich Albion supporters this evening offered a generally positive reaction to the news that Sam Johnstone had become Darren Moore 's first capture .
Johnstone , 25 , has moved to The Hawthorns from Manchester United on a four-year deal and comes with plenty of previous Championship experience having enjoyed spells at Preston and more recently Aston Villa .
The stopper 's arrival has paved the way for existing number one Ben Foster to make his move away from The Hawthorns , with Watford the likeliest destination .
It would bring to an end a seven-year association with the Baggies and , after the exit too of Boaz Myhill , it 'll be all change between the sticks under Moore .
Johnstone 's entrance kick-starts the club 's transfer business ahead of what is expected to be a very busy month .
Here is what the fans have been saying .
Paul Harris : We 've had to wait a while , but really impressed with the Johnstone signing , exactly the right age plus experience to hit the ground running in a very tough division next year . Let 's just hope this is the start to a busy July and this is the first of a few to come !
Joe Crabb : Do n't know what # AVFC fans are complaining about . Players go on loan to small clubs in the hope that they impress a big club to come and sign him !
Stig 's Baggie Cousin : # wba have paid upwards of 6mil for a goalie . That 's a sign of intent as far as I 'm concerned .
Kieran Corbett : Johnstone is a good signing , realistically we would have had to replace foster probably next season anyway , and Johnstone is a good keeper
Iain Bate : Great signing for the Baggies . Be happy is this is the sign of things to come # wba
Anthony Curtis : Very happy with the signing of Sam Johnstone , especially as it took my mind off Colombia for 5 minute
Jake : Buzzing that we have finally signed someone and a very good goalkeeper # wba
Jason Wheeler : Sam Johnstone should be the template for the type of players we bring in a talented young keeper who 's only going to get better and will want to play we 're ultimately the club want to be the premier league & achieve that as one
What 's been said
Darren Moore has hailed Sam Johnstone as `` the shape of things to come '' after snaffling him from under the noses of rivals Aston Villa .
Johnstone is the first signing of Moore 's reign and the Baggies boss is delighted to land the goalkeeper from Manchester United .
The 25-year-old has agreed a four-year deal at The Hawthorns , having spent the last 18 months on loan at Villa in the Championship .
It is understood the fee is in the region of £6 million .
poll loading Albion fans - are you happy with the signing of Sam Johnstone ? 1000+ VOTES SO FAR Yeah , buzzing Nah , not really
`` Sam is young and determined to be the best keeper he can possibly be - he 's hungry to do that with us at Albion , '' said Moore .
`` We 've had him targeted from the outset and we 're all delighted to have him on board .
`` He buys into exactly what we are trying to achieve and will hopefully represent the shape of things to come . ''
WHAT JOHNSTONE SAYS
`` I 'm happy to be here . I 've spoken to a lot of people about the club and heard nothing but good things .
`` It 's good to get through the door . I 've played Championship games and won a promotion from League One with Preston but always seemed to end back at Manchester United or going somewhere else .
`` Now it 's time to settle down and take my game up to the next level which I believe I can do here . ''

Many of us here at Autoblog are unabashed enthusiasts of the endangered manual transmission , and we know we 're not alone . Honda , which makes several of its vehicles available with a stick , released a video aimed at orienting beginners to the simple joys of driving a stick.In it , Zach Vlasuk of Honda and Accura technical public relations uses a 2018 Accord to give a basic rundown of how manual transmissions work and how to operate them . He also explains , with the help of some nifty animation , how the clutch pedal represents the link between the always-spinning engine to the non-spinning transmission , and how ( slowly ) releasing the clutch while ( slowly ) pressing down on the gas is how the clutch fully connects with the engine and the car , you know , moves . `` It 's all about smoothness and balance , '' he says — a lesson that will resonate with anyone who remembers seeking out deserted parking lots or remote roads with their parents to embark on the herky-jerky process of learning to drive one.Sadly , the three-pedal manual transmission has been fading in popularity in recent years in favor of easier-to-operate ( but boring ) , faster-shifting and more fuel-efficient automatics , or newfangled transmission options like CVTs and dual-clutch automated manuals . According to Edmunds , manual-equipped vehicles make up only 3 percent of all U.S. car sales today . But to enthusiasts , there 's no substitute for the command and performance perks of the three pedals . `` It 's about immersing yourself in the driving experience and embracing the height level of car control , '' Vlasuk says in the video.Honda , which still blessedly offers manual-trans versions of the Accord Fit and HR-V , last week hosted an event near Los Angeles to teach people how to drive its stick-shift vehicles , present and past , including an early Civic CVCC and the Prelude Type SH . Taken together with the video , does this signal a commitment from the brand to the manual for the long haul ? One can only hope.While you 're here , do n't forget to check out our handy rundown of new vehicles available with manual transmissions . It 's a longer list than you might expect .
The man who killed three people during a knife and shooting rampage through the Belgian city of Liege carried out an act of “ terrorist murder , ” prosecutors said on Wednesday , and authorities were trying to establish whether he acted alone .
Benjamin Herman , an inmate on a two-day release , attacked two female police officers with a knife from behind , stabbing them repeatedly , before stealing their weapons and shooting them as they lay on the ground , officials said .
Crossing the road , he fired several shots at a 22-year old man who was a passenger in a car , killing him . Herman then took at least one woman hostage at a nearby school . When police closed in , he ran out onto the sidewalk firing and police fatally shot him . He yelled “ Allahu akbar , ” the Arabic phrase for God is great , several times during the rampage , authorities said .
Belgian federal magistrate Wenke Roggen said on Wednesday that the attack was considered “ terrorist murder. ” She said it 's being treated as terrorism given the way Herman acted , which she says resembled Islamic State calls via video to attack police with knives and steal their weapons , the fact that he yelled “ Allahu Akbar ” and was in contact with radicalised people .
Earlier , Interior Minister Jan Jambon confirmed that Herman had already killed another person the day before the attack . Jambon also said that the woman he took hostage may have talked the shooter down and helped to avoid more deaths inside the school .
“ He also committed a murder the night before , ” Jambon told broadcaster RTL . Jambon confirmed that the fourth victim was a former inmate who did prison time with Herman . Herman is alleged to have killed the man on Monday evening by hitting him over the head with a blunt object .
Amid questions about how two officers could have been disarmed , Jambon praised the work of all involved , saying “ the police did an extraordinary job . ”
“ They reacted well . All the systems , all the procedures worked . But if you are attacked from behind , as was the case with the two officers , you ca n't do anything , ” he said .
Sinn Féin has formally suspended Senator Máire Devine for three months after she retweeted a tweet referring to murdered prison guard Brian Stack as a “ sadist prison officer ” .
Brian Stack , an officer in Portlaoise prison , was shot in the neck in Dublin in 1983 by a member of the IRA and died 18 months after the attack .
A retweet by Senator Devine referred to his son Austin Stack , as the “ Fianna Fáil son of a sadist prison officer ” . The retweet has since been deleted from Senator Devine 's Twitter account .
Sinn Féin said the party “ strongly disapproves of what has happened . There can be no excuse for the hurt and offence which has been caused to the Stack family . ”
Declan Kearney MLA , national chairman of the party , said the incident represented “ unacceptable behaviour ” on the part of an elected representative .
“ The Ard Chomhairle has suspended , with immediate effect , Senator Devine from party membership and all party activities for a period of three months .
“ The whip has been removed and Senator Devine will be outside of the Leinster House team for that period ” he said .
Distress
Senator Devine apologised for retweeting the message : “ It was never my intention to cause any distress or hurt , particularly to victims of the conflict . I want to offer my most sincere apologies to the family of the late Brian Stack . ”
Austin Stack , who has campaigned for his father 's murderer to be brought to justice , called the tweet “ disgusting , ” and said the party should go further and expel Ms Devine .
“ The new SF president Mary Lou McDonald promised us a fresh start . She promised us that this sort of behaviour was in the past but as can be seen from the Barry McElduff affair and now this , we know that these low standards aimed at silencing their victims are still the norm within that organisation ” said Mr Stack .
This is the latest political embarrassment for Sinn Féin . In January the party 's Barry McElduff resigned as a Westminster MP following a controversial video he posted on Twitter with a loaf of Kingsmill bread on his head .
The video has tweeted on the 42nd anniversary of the Kingsmill massacre , where 10 Protestant workers were murdered by republicans in Co Armagh in 1976 .

ST. JOHN 'S , N.L . — A lawyer for former residential school students excluded from a national apology in 2008 says Justin Trudeau will be in Labrador on Nov. 24 to apologize .
Steven Cooper says the Prime Minister 's Office has confirmed he 'll be in Goose Bay for an event that 's expected to include about 300 people .
About 1,000 class-action members accepted a $ 50-million package from the federal government to settle claims of abuse and cultural losses .
A spokesman for Trudeau could not be immediately reached .
Former prime minister Stephen Harper excluded the province 's former residential schools from an apology and compensation package , saying they were different .
But lawyers for students of four schools in Labrador and one in Newfoundland argued Ottawa owed the same duty of care to them after the province joined Confederation in 1949 .

Eating nuts significantly increases the quality of a man 's sperm , a study has found .
A trial found that nuts improve sperm count , vitality , swimming ability and shape - all factors that influence fertility .
Nuts are rich in omega-3 fatty acids , antioxidants and folate , which in other studies have also been found to benefit sperm .
For the 14-week study , 119 healthy young men aged 18 to 35 were randomly assigned to two groups . One ate a normal western diet , while the other consumed the same diet with 60 grams per day of mixed almonds , hazelnuts and walnuts .
Comparing the two groups showed that men who had nuts added to their diet had a 16 % higher sperm count , while their sperm vitality was improved by 4 % , motility - swimming ability - by 6 % and morphology ( shape ) by 1 % .
Men in the nut group also showed significantly reduced levels of sperm DNA fragmentation , which is closely linked to male infertility .

The Spanish authors said the study results were not on their own enough to justify urging men to eat nuts if they want to conceive .
But lead researcher Dr Albert Salas-Huetos , from the University Rovira i Virgili in Reus , said : `` Evidence is accumulating in the literature that healthy lifestyle changes such as following a healthy dietary pattern might help conception - and of course , nuts are a key component of a Mediterranean healthy diet . ''
The findings were presented at the annual meeting of the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology ( Eshre ) taking place in Barcelona , Spain .
A major study last year reported a significant general decline in sperm counts in North America , Europe , Australia and New Zealand between 1973 and 2011 .
The analysis of semen samples from more than 40,000 men showed that over this period , sperm counts fell by about 1.6 % per year on average .
British expert Allan Pacey , Professor of Andrology at the University of Sheffield , said : `` There have been many studies showing that nutritional supplements ( or diets ) can influence sperm quality . For example there is quite a lot of data showing that men on 'good ' diets ( ie lots of fruit and veg ) generally have better sperm quality than men on 'poor ' diets ( beef burgers and chips ) .
`` This is generally put down to the fact that the former have a better micronutrient intake and more antioxidants than the latter group . However , I suspect that there is n't just one thing which causes the effect .
`` Therefore , with regard to this study , I am not surprised that a diet rich in nuts is associated with better sperm . ''
He added that a potential flaw in the study was that it was impossible to eat nuts `` blind '' . Trial participants who knew they were eating nuts might have changed other aspects of their lifestyle , which could have skewed the results .

PORT HARCOURT— FEAR has heightened in Rivers State communities following the order from the Inspector- General of Police , Ibrahim Idris , directing the police to retrieve arms from vigilante groups across the country .
Already , the State Police Commissioner , Ahmed Zaki , has given 21 days ultimatum to all vigilante members in the state to surrender their arms or face arrest and prosecution if caught .
But communities prone to cult activities and armed robbery attacks have described the decision of IGP as ill-fated , stressing that they would be at the mercies of criminals .
A resident of Ihediohanma Street in Mile 2 , Diobu , Port Harcourt City Local Government Area of the state , who simply gave her name as Ihuoma , told Niger-Delta Voice that the criminals in Diobu area are already preparing to resume their nefarious activities .
Ihuoma noted that the people of the area received the news of the IGP directive with shock , adding that the area may return to its past notoriety where crime was the order of the day if the directive is not reversed .
She said : “ I will not believe that the police mean what they are saying . If they take guns from the vigilante groups , the bad boys that used to trouble us will all come back . We know what this place used to be when we had no vigilante group .
“ Taking arms from them will mean that the vigilante will not function again . They are the people who chased criminals away from Diobu . They can not face these criminals who are using guns with bare hands . Criminals will take over the place . ”
Also , Ibrahim , a resident of Gambia Street , said : “ If the vigilantes go on strike , there will be problem because those criminals that the vigilante chased out will come back with full force to continue their activities . ”
We are going on strike- DVG
Meanwhile , Diobu Vigilante Group , DVG , has embarked on indefinite strike , following the IG 's directive to retrieve their arms .
The group urged IGP Idris to also move to retrieve arms from the dreaded herdsmen , Boko Haram and militant groups , adding that the order would rupture the fragile peace in the state .
Speaking in Port Harcourt , the leader of Diobu Vigilante Group , DVG , Victor Ohaji , said the order would affect communities that are facing cult-related activities , describing the IGP 's directive as anti-security .
He said : “ It is not good for the vigilante groups to submit arms when we know that criminals in the state are armed with sophisticated weapons . It will affect security because we can not go after criminals who have guns with stick .
“ They that are giving this order have guns and security . It will affect common people who do not have money to provide security for themselves . They should also retrieve arms from herdsmen , Boko Haram and other criminal elements for us to have a crime-free nation . ”
Meanwhile , the secretary of DVG , Prince Amatari , has urged the IGP to review and reverse the order , adding that vigilante groups should be trained in security management and armed to support the police .
Amatari said : “ We need training so that we can handle guns . Taking guns from us is to discourage us from providing security to our people . We want to work for our people . Police do not get to our rural communities ; it is only vigilante that gives hope to them . ”
We do not use arms for criminality
The Security Planning Advisory Council , OSPAC , a local vigilante group assisting in providing security at Ogba/Egbema/Ndoni Local Government Area of Rivers State said it does not use arms to kill or kidnap .
OSPAC has distanced itself from alleged involvement in criminal activities of extra-judicial killings and kidnapping .
It also raised alarm that some big wigs who sponsored the late Don Waney and killings in ONELGA are not tired of their activities , adding that they want to resume killings in the area .
OSPAC in a statement by its Chairman , Professor Maxwell Ahiakwo ( Associate ) , regretted that those individuals are not happy with the security achievement in ONELGA , adding that they are using all means to discredit OSPAC to enable them resume killings in the area .
Ahiakwo noted that OSPAC was neither created to victimise any individual nor for political reasons , adding that all the security agencies are aware of its tremendous achievements since inception .
He said : “ We are aware that the sponsors of Don Waney are still very bitter with OSPAC for leading the onslaught against the late notorious criminal and his gang .
“ All the propaganda in the media are planted by the sponsors and disciples of Don Waney aimed at twisting the truth to deceive the public . They want OSPAC to be proscribed and banned from operations so they can resume their carnage against the good people of ONELGA . ”
Ahiakwo , however , assured that OSPAC would remain focused in carrying out its responsibility of providing security and called for support from residents of ONELGA .

FIJIANS have been urged to move away from eating a lot of processed foods and focus more on consuming organic foods .
National adviser for non-communicable diseases , Dr Isimeli Tukana said statistics have shown that Fijians were consuming more processed foods which were not good for their health .
Organic foods are foods that do not have chemicals added to it .
`` The challenge now with Fijians is that they are eating more processed foods . They do n't know how to eat the processed foods . We want all Fijians to eat organic foods , '' Dr Tukana said .
`` Organic foods are the closest to the body . It is the best for the body but because of development we are moving to foods that are more accessible , cheap and nicer to eat .
`` The fast foods and the cheap foods do not necessarily mean healthy foods . Organic foods mean there are no chemicals in food . ''
Dr Tukana said another challenge faced by the ministry was trying to get people balance what they eat and train .
`` For physical activity the challenge now is technology and sitting . The technologies that have come are making us to sit more . For that we need to find solutions of more physical activity and less sitting time .
`` We should just be conscious that you need to take your 30 minutes physical activity in a day . The challenge now is a lot of us are sitting because of the technologies and the type of work we do , '' he said .
`` I want all Fijians to eat organic foods but statistics are showing me that more people are eating more processed foods . ''
Dr Tukana said processed food did not equal organic foods .

MIAMI BEACH , FLA. ( WSVN ) - Miami Beach Police have launched an investigation after a video surfaced of an officer allegedly making inappropriate comments toward motorcyclists over the holiday weekend .
As a group of bikers passed through Miami Beach , Sunday , a video captured what appears to be an officer saying , “ I hope you all [ expletive ] crash and die . ”
Miami Beach Police released a statement that said , “ Our officers were tasked with escorting the reckless operators out of our city as quickly and safely as possible . ”
Police also said an internal affair investigation has been launched to investigate the comments that were made in the video .
Meanwhile , a motorcyclist did crash and die in Miami , Sunday , and the victim 's cousin is now blaming police .
Yoinis Cruz Pena was thrown from the overpass leaving Rickenbacker Causeway . Another woman on the motorcycle was rushed to the hospital in critical condition .
Pena 's cousin , Alejandro Mustafa , claimed footage showed a Miami Police officer tailing his group .
“ Why you guys put other people 's lives in danger , chasing after them ? ” said Mustafa . “ By the law , you 're not supposed to chase them . ”
In the video , the police car appears to be passing the group of riders .
According to Miami Police , officers did nothing more than respond to the crash .
Miami Police released a statement that said , “ The Miami Police Department does not have knowledge or information of any Miami Police officers or any other agency in pursuit of said motorcycle , or any other motorcycle , in the area at the time of the crash . ”
However , riders claim they are regularly on the police radar .
“ These police officers have it against us , ” said motorcyclist Adelaida Andrade .

Ratatat Theater Group is looking for veterans to audition for Happy Few , a new play based on the stories of Santa Barbara veterans .
Ratatat TG , a Santa Barbara theater company dedicated to new work and community enlivenment , has developed a new play based on William Shakespeare 's Henry V and the stories of Santa Barbara 's veterans . In Happy Few , the classic characters from our literate past mingle with the personal stories from our neighbors ' lives , forming a play that explores issues of patriotism , purpose and what is worth fighting for in our country today .
No acting experience is necessary . Veterans of all ages and experiences are invited to audition .
For information or to make an appointment , please contact Casey Caldwell by phone at 805.679.1268 or email at . ( JavaScript must be enabled to view this email address ) .
Rehearsals will begin the week of July 15 and will continue twice a week until the play opens Nov. 7 . If you are cast , we will work with your schedule .
What 's the play about ?
Happy Few tracks the path of war , from the early days of uncertainty and excitement , to the battlefield where men and women are beaten down and rise up , to the journey home , where people try figure out what it all meant , and try to find peace . It tracks this path with two guides : first , a classic representation of war — Shakespeare 's Henry V — and second , the personal stories of veterans from Santa Barbara .
We found in Henry V a play that can make us shiver with its vision of honor , glorious sacrifice , a “ band of brothers ” that “ shall be remembered. ” The play speaks to some of the deepest longings of our souls . And yet , the “ happy few ” of the play fight a war that is essentially futile — a squabble for land and power , and their victory is reversed only a few years later . So what was the meaning of their struggle ?
Ratatat conducted interviews over a period of months with Santa Barbara veterans who fought in World War II , Vietnam , Iraq , Afghanistan and other places and times , and found that though the specifics were different , many things were the same . Nearly everyone spoke of their pride in the ideal of the military , of the principles of sacrifice and brotherhood that it represents ; but everyone had also seen that ideal cause pain , and struggled with that pain .
And so we mixed these stories together to make a new play , in which classic characters from our literary past mingle with the personal stories from our neighbor 's lives . The play wrestles with some of our deepest yearnings — for a leader , for a cause , for a something to believe in — yearnings that are very old and always new . We hope through the play to help us all understand those yearnings a little better , and what to do with them .
Find more information about the play and profiles of some of the veterans we interviewed on our website by clicking here .

This is the shocking moment a BMW driver RAMMED a police car after a high-speed chase along the M6 .
Astonishing dashcam footage shows Drew McWilliam , 25 , running from the stolen vehicle after he smashed it into officers who had tailed him along the motorway and into a service station .
McWilliam was spotted driving the stolen BMW along the M6 on October 29 , last year .
Police covertly pursued him as he pulled into services , where officers from the Tactical Vehicle Intercept Unit planned to stop the car travelling any further .
But brazen McWilliam instead rammed the BMW into the pursuing police car and then tried to force his way onto the WRONG side of the motorway .
Officers prevented him from fleeing and he was arrested .
Sergeant Andrew Torkington said : “ McWilliam , in his reckless driving , was a risk to himself , our officers and the public . I can only imagine the damage that could have been caused if he had carried on .
“ Our team of dedicated and highly trained officers work around the clock to put a stop to those who evade the law and put others ' lives in danger .
“ We are busier than ever , targeting people like McWilliam in order to secure the appropriate sentences for their crime . ”
McWilliam , of Cotefield Road , was sentenced last week to three years in prison for handling stolen property and one year for dangerous driving , to serve concurrently .
He was found guilty following a three-day trial , helped by the footage which showed him running from the vehicle .
McWilliam took the BMW from an address before changing its plates .
From there he drove it onto the M6 and stopped at a service where he was intercepted by officers .

A popular Christmas attraction in Sutton Coldfield is CLOSED due to the snow .
Santa 's grotto at the town 's Gracechurch Shopping Centre is closed today ( Monday , December 11 ) for the second day running due to the snowy conditions – perhaps down to ‘ elf and safety ' !
A sign outside the grotto , which has tape and cones around it , says : “ Apologies Santa will not be in his grotto today .
“ Unfortunately Santa and his elves are unable to be on-site today as they have been caught up in a storm and got stuck between the North Pole and the Gracechurch . ”
Neil Dance asked on Twitter : `` Has Santa got stuck in the snow ? '' And the Gracechurch Centre replied : “ He did his best to get to the grotto but the roads are a bit bad . ”
A reply which has led to concerns about his flying reindeer with just two weeks to go .
Today the Gracechurch Centre tweeted : “ Unfortunately , due to the weather conditions , our Grotto wo n't be opening today . We are sorry for the inconvenience [ sic ] .
“ All grotto booking for today will be re-arranged . For more information please email Santa 's elves on help @ adminticket.com ”

Mark Wahlberg , noted Super Bowl leaver . Patrick Smith/Getty Images
When Donald Trump left his Mar-a-Lago Super Bowl party last year , the New England Patriots were trailing the Atlanta Falcons in the third quarter , 28-3 . After the president 's departure , Tom Brady ( a close , personal friend ) orchestrated the greatest comeback in Super Bowl history , and New England went on to win , 34-28 . What a thing to miss ! Surely the president , who is n't prone to regrets , would at least regret this . But he should n't . That 's because he made the right move .
Out of all of the behaviors exhibited by Donald Trump , leaving a Super Bowl party early is one of only two that I am confident in endorsing . ( The other one is gabbing with your friends on the phone at night . It 's a lost art and a great way to decompress . ) My only critique of Trump 's exit is that it did n't come early enough . Leave at halftime , or late in the second quarter . Either way , you should always watch the second half of the Super Bowl at home .
Super Bowls run late , and nothing knocks the stuffing out of your weekend like finding yourself bloated , tired , and a commute away from your bed on a cold Sunday night . This is not to say you should n't attend Super Bowl parties . They 're fun ! By all means , pick up some beer and a bag of those chips that are specially engineered for dipping and head to a friend 's place . But go early , when it 's still light out and the miserable grip of the impending work week has yet to compress your soul .
Thankfully , you wo n't have to worry about missing any game action if you leave at halftime . Super Bowl halftimes can last over 30 minutes , which is more than twice as long as a regular season halftime . These interminable performances are so drawn-out that the players—professional athletes in peak physical condition—have to prepare themselves in the weeks leading up to the game for the unique toll of an extended halftime . This lengthy break may shake them off their rhythm , but it gives you ample time to hit the road .
( If you 're really concerned about missing Justin Timberlake , it will be OK. Not only will the halftime show be immediately uploaded to the internet , but Prince 's performance from the 2007 Super Bowl is already on YouTube , and you should just watch that instead . )
Plus , NBC 's post-game programming this year is probably more compelling than the halftime show . The network is using the Super Bowl lead-in to boost ratings for This Is Us . I 've never seen the critically acclaimed drama , but I hear it can get pretty heavy . Do you want to suffer an emotional episode at someone else 's house while they 're throwing away cans and doing the dishes ? Of course not . If you 're going to cry , do so at home , in the familiar recliner that already knows all your secrets .
Of course , the objective goodness of leaving early only applies to viewing parties and not the actual , live Super Bowl . If you 're shelling out for seats ( or if you have pleased a corporation so much that they have bequeathed you with tickets ) , you really should stay . Mark Wahlberg deservedly caught some flak last year when he was caught leaving NRG Stadium in Houston before the Patriots ' comeback . To make matters worse , he tossed his son under the bus afterwards , telling Men 's Health that the child had thrown a tantrum and forced them to leave .
You need n't worry about coming up with an excuse for leaving a viewing party . No one cares if you duck out early . It 's a Super Bowl party , not a custody hearing . The second half will go on as planned , with or without you .
And besides , people shhh you for talking during commercials at Super Bowl parties . That 's borderline unacceptable during the first half , but it 's totally unreasonable behavior in the second , when the ads start to repeat and networks roll out teases for the local news . Why subject yourself to this abuse ? If anyone is going to tell you to shut up as the Super Bowl crawls to its conclusion , it should be your loving family , and they should be hurling this abuse at you from a setting that makes everyone comfortable : home .

Google is offering a new service , which it says could help British homeowners save money by switching to solar power .
The tech giant has released an online tool called Project Sunroof , in partnership with energy supplier Eon , that estimates savings using data from Google 's Earth and Maps apps .
It first launched in the US in 2015 , where reviews suggested it was broadly accurate but gave some odd results .
Google is also working with German software firm Tetraeder on the project .
Project Sunroof uses machine learning to estimate how much solar potential a house has by examining the property 's features , such as its roof area and angle , and weather data , such as sun positioning .
Google claims that its models are detailed enough to assess the impact of a single tree on a home 's solar potential .
It is n't the first tool of its kind - Ikea offers a similar service in collaboration with Solarcentury , and Tesla launched its own Solar Roof Calculator last summer .
But these companies and others require homeowners to submit additional data about the shape of their roofs or their homes before getting a quote on savings .
'Half-tempted '
Jonathan Marshall , head of analysis at the non-profit organisation Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit , said that Project Sunroof `` lowers the barriers '' for homeowners by automatically inspecting roofing data using Google Earth imagery .
`` By analysing the roof shape , they will take out one of the steps that you would have to go through to get solar panels installed , '' Mr Marshall told the BBC .
`` The speed of the process means that if you 're half-tempted by the idea , you 're more likely to go ahead with it . ''
Project Sunroof first launched in the US in 2015 and then in Germany last year . It is now available in select UK regions , including Birmingham , Brighton , Liverpool , Newcastle , Reading and parts of London .
Nicole Lombardo , head of partnerships at Google , said : `` We are excited to help people in the UK make more informed choices about installing solar panels on their rooftops and transition to renewable energy sources . ''
The tool is another example of Google 's public commitment to green energy .
It announced in 2017 that its global operations were powered using only renewable energy sources .

From sunup to well after sundown , NW fire service training adjuncts were putting the lessons they teach in the classroom to work , following the devastation of Hurricane Harvey .
NW special operations adjunct instructor Bill VerSteeg deployed to Kingwood , Texas , Aug. 28 with Texas Task Force 2 , he said .
“ I got the call , and we headed out at about seven o'clock at night , ” VerSteeg said .
In Kingwood , VerSteeg and his team helped with rescues for the first few days and then spent the rest of their deployment traveling and assisting other departments in impacted areas to answer the backlog of 911 calls , he said .
“ We 've been maybe getting a couple of hours of sleep a night , ” VerSteeg said . “ We 're having to move from one location to another . ”
The team started working when the sun came up , and they worked all day until well after dark . Then they changed and headed to the next location where they 're needed , he said .
VerSteeg 's deployment was for seven days , and at the end of it his task force had to leave , he said .
NW boat operator and squad officer Joe Short deployed with Texas Task Force 1 Aug. 24 before Harvey made landfall , he said .
“ We 've been doing water rescues , ” Short said . “ We started in Corpus and then made our way to Houston . ”
While the adjuncts are down south helping with the relief effort , their classes were being covered by other instructors who were n't deployed .
“ Classes do n't get suspended . They call Mike Noyes and tell him they 're deployed , and he 'll cover it , ” NW boat operator and squad officer Joe Short said .
Noyes , a NW special operations adjunct instructor , ensured all of the adjuncts deployed had their classes covered while they 're gone .
“ All of our instructors are full-time firefighters , ” Noyes said . “ Teaching is a part-time job for their off days . ”
Most firefighters on the task forces from North Texas did their swift water training and structural collapse training on NW Campus , he said .
“ Our swift water program , because of the simulator we have , there 's not another one like it in the country , ” he said . “ We draw people from all over for that class . ”
In addition to the NW adjunct instructors , NW alumnus Elisa Marquis deployed last week with the Coast Guard to Port Aransas . Unlike the adjunct instructors serving on Texas task forces , Marquis does n't know how long she 'll be helping out with the relief effort in Southeast Texas .
“ We 're doing POD work— it 's point of distribution , ” she said . “ We 're getting everybody ice , water , wipes , diapers , things that they need until they get everything fixed up . ”
The most impactful thing for Marquis has been how positive people are , she said .
“ The fact that everybody 's been so positive , even the people that have lost everything , they 're keeping a smile on their face and just trying to push through life , ” she said .

A MAN in Waiyavi , Lautoka is complaining of improper drainage in his area that leaves his home flooded during periods of heavy rain .
Alekisio Nainima , 61 , said several drains from the Waiyavi area connected close to his home and when the drains overflowed his home was the first , if not the only one to be flooded .
`` I have lived here for seven years and I 've taken the issue up to the local council and I still have n't heard anything , '' he said .
Mr Nainima lives near a creek where the outlet to several drains from Sukanaivalu Rd is located .
`` The outlet is small and you have all these drains connected and so you can imagine when it overflows . This is just poor planning and I am hopeful there will be a remedy . ''
Lautoka City Council chief executive officer Jone Nakauvadra said he was aware of the issue .
`` We are knowledgeable of the issue and we are working with the Fiji Roads Authority to address it , '' he said .
…Says looters under Buhari responsible
The immediate past Deputy National Publicity Secretary of the ruling All Progressives Congress ( APC ) Comrade Timi Frank , has said that instead of some persons protesting against the leadership of the National Assembly who are just lawmakers , it should have been against current killings , poverty and high unemployment in the country .
He also challenged the protesters to take another protest to the presidential villa to demand a stop to the menace under the leadership of President Muhammadu Buhari led government .
In a statement signed on Wednesday , Comrade Frank , who alleged that “ some looters serving in the current administration of APC sponsored the protesters against the leadership of the National Assembly , ” added that both the Senate President , Dr. Bukola Saraki and the Speaker House of Representatives , Yakubu Dogara are not the problems the country is currently going through “ but the president has failed to implement the budget to the later . ”
According to the former APC spokesman , the only offence both Saraki and Dogara have committed is failure to impeach President Buhari over numerous impeachable offences and breach of constitution by his government .
He said a video in circulation has exposed the ignorance of some of the protesters who blocked the National Assembly 's main entrance on Tuesday as it shown in the said video that many of the protesters were mobilised with N1,500 only to protest against the alleged increase and introduction of new projects into the 2018 budget .
“ Unknown to many of these sponsored protesters , it is the constitutional responsibility of National Assembly to add or remove from whatever the executive budgeted because it is an arm of government which is never a rubber stamp institution in any mature democratic society .
“ Let those who are sponsoring these protesters know clearly that they are real enemies of democracy and that the act is worse than terrorism . ”
While urging Nigerian youth not to allow themselves to be used against the institution of National Assembly , Frank said Nigerian lawmakers under the leadership of Sen. Bukola Saraki and Speaker Yakubu Dogara have passed a bill such as NotTooYoungToRun bill , which he said has direct positive impact on the young men and women to actively participate in governance at all levels .
“ The way this government is sponsoring blackmailers against the leadership of National Assembly has clearly shown that the talk of fight against corruption is an illusion . Nigerians will need to know where the appointees of this administration got the money to sponsor over five thousands protesters against a lawful institution if not as part of the looted money under President Muhammadu Buhari led government ? , ” he queried .

Update , 5:45 p.m. April 24 : According to a tweet from Ericka Downey , the woman who donated a kidney for former Texas A & M coach Billy Gillispie 's transplant , everything went well with the surgery .
Out of surgery . Everything went great . pic.twitter.com/06kXIDd014 — Ericka Downey ( @ D2Diva ) April 24 , 2018
We have a date . Kidney transplant is confirmed for Tuesday , April 24 at Mayo Clinic in Rochester . Pray for @ mdowneyNSU . I 'm a terrible patient . 😂 — Ericka Downey ( @ D2Diva ) April 2 , 2018
ORIGINAL STORY FOLLOWS SAN ANTONIO -- Other than his fiery sideline moments and occasional caustic retorts to college basketball reporters , Billy Gillispie is n't much on expressing emotion . On Friday night , though , Gillispie 's eyes reddened when , for the first time , he came face to face with Ericka Downey . After reading a Dec. 16 Dallas Morning News story about former Texas A & M and Kentucky coach Gillispie 's medical plight , she felt compelled to bestow upon him the gift of life . Namely one of her kidneys . Turns out it will be her left one , Downey and doctors decided after testing Sunday through Wednesday at Minnesota 's Mayo Clinic confirmed that she is a donor match for Gillispie . `` It 's my best side , '' Downey , 33 , told Gillispie , 58 , after he greeted her with a tight hug . Minutes later he struggled to find adequate words of gratitude . `` I do n't know what would prompt anyone to do that , '' he said , voice cracking . `` Other than just it 's God 's grace . I do n't understand it , but I 'm definitely appreciative of it . And it 's great to meet her . '' The poignant Good Friday meeting occurred in a party room at Ruth 's Chris Steak House on San Antonio 's Riverwalk amid Final Four and Easter weekend .
The setting , though noisy , was fitting . Downey is the wife of Mark Downey , who just completed his first season as head basketball coach at Northeastern State in Tahlequah , Okla. College basketball coaches from around the country annually congregate at the Final Four . The Downeys for the last 10 years have hosted a Final Four dinner for coaches who have worked with Mark through the years , and their families . This year 's gathering of about 50 featured a grateful guest of honor and extra reasons to celebrate beyond the passage of another eventful basketball season . Gillispie drove down Friday morning from Ranger College , 85 miles west of Fort Worth , where he remained as athletic director after his health crisis forced him to step aside as basketball coach . Gillispie and Mark Downey have known each other since the late 1990s , when Gillispie was a Tulsa assistant under current Kansas coach Bill Self and Downey was coach at Independence ( Kan. ) Community College . Until Friday , though , Gillispie and Ericka Downey had not met . They only had exchanged text messages and one phone call , the latter of which occurred Thursday morning when Downey informed Gillispie of the good news she had just received from the Mayo Clinic . The transplant surgery date has n't been set , but Ericka Downey said it most likely will happen within the next two to six weeks , depending on when her Mayo Clinic surgical team and Gillispie 's can coordinate a date . Raised by his mother , Winnifred , in the small town of Graford in Palo Pinto County , Gillispie said he 's always been a person of faith , though `` I 'm not a very good ambassador . '' His rise through the high school and college assistant ranks to become a star coach at UT-El Paso and Texas A & M made him a Texas basketball legend .
Update : Mayo Clinic confirms ex-A & M coach Billy Gillispie can receive a kidney from 'angel ' donor
Then came high-profile crashes at Kentucky ( 2009 ) and Texas Tech ( 2012 ) , the latter of which coincided with his first major medical scare and stay at the Mayo Clinic because of high blood pressure and kidney problems . He reattained coaching bliss in 2015 after going to Ranger , where in the early 1980s he played basketball and baseball . Twice , however , health issues have forced him off Ranger 's sideline . Friday evening , amid the party room din , he was asked whether his faith has been strengthened in recent weeks . `` Absolutely , '' he said . `` Because you ca n't explain this . This is not a deed . I mean , it 's a great deed that 's happening , but it 's not a deed that was inspired by people . It had to be inspired by a greater being , if you ask me . `` It 's an amazing story . The best part about it is it 's not about me . It 's about her . What I could only hope for is not a kidney for me , but for an inspiration to a lot of others to donate . ''
' A woman of big ideas '
Along seven small-college coaching stops , Mark and Ericka Downey have raised sons Bryce ( 12 ) and Drew ( 6 ) . Ericka , meanwhile , has built a successful career in medical device sales . Last Dec. 16 she returned from a sales trip and , while putting away her suitcase , decided to clean her cluttered closet . While taking a break from cleaning she checked Twitter and saw The News ' report that Gillispie was in urgent need of a transplant . `` I was watching TV , and she came and nonchalantly started talking about Billy and how I knew him , '' Mark Downey said . `` And then told me he was in renal failure . '' Ericka told Mark that she had retweeted The News ' story . She vowed to do whatever she could to raise awareness of Gillispie 's situation and find him a donor . She strongly encouraged her husband to do likewise . `` She 's a woman of big ideas , '' Mark said , laughing . What he did n't know was that Ericka immediately had thoughts of being Gillispie 's donor . Dec. 16 was a Saturday . She said that while taking a shower the following day the voice in her head was so strong that it was as if she were speaking out loud . `` God , are you really telling me this ? Is this something that I 'm just making up ? Would I do it for anyone , not just Coach Gillispie ? What would this be like for my family ? What would it be like talking to my husband ? '' Then she told Mark . `` I kind of thought that it would n't go past the first couple of tests , '' he said . `` But over time it kept going and kept going . And I ca n't argue with her reasoning . She 's not going to listen to me , anyway , if I do . '' Initially Ericka had no way to get hold of Gillispie . She had read in The News story that Gillispie had been treated by an Abilene nephrologist and was planning to undergo tests at the Mayo Clinic . She called the Abilene doctor and the Mayo Clinic to find out whether Gillispie was on the transplant list . He was n't yet , so Ericka kept digging and continued her Twitter campaign . In January , one of Gillispie 's former Texas Tech assistants , Josh Mills , was visiting Gillispie in Ranger . He remarked to Gillispie , who does n't have a Twitter account , about the Oklahoma woman who seemed so determined to help him . Mills reached out to Ericka through Twitter and sent her Gillispie 's phone number . They exchanged texts for the first time on Jan. 11 . That 's when she found out he was about to join about 100,000 people on the transplant list . Ericka has O-positive blood , which makes her a universal blood donor . Still , what were the odds of her being a compatible kidney donor for Gillispie ? She sent blood and urine samples to the Mayo Clinic and , on Feb. 15 , learned that she and Gillispie were a match , contingent on further tests at the clinic . Until Ericka told him Friday , Gillispie was n't aware that she had learned of his condition by reading the Dec. 16 News story , in which Gillispie spoke matter-of-factly about his mortality ( `` I 've had a great life '' ) and remarked that he was n't even sure he would accept a kidney from someone . Gillispie , who admittedly has had salty relationships with some reporters over the years , half-joked Friday : `` I told Ericka , 'This is probably the first time anyone 's ever read one of your stories . ' But I 'm glad she did . ''
' I do n't deserve this '
Ericka 's Mayo Clinic tests included a three-hour CT exam in which her body was aligned in various contrasts . Otherwise , the most difficult part was having to fast for 24 hours . She said that one of the first people she met after arriving at the Mayo Clinic last Sunday was a female patient who was there for a routine follow-up , 27 years after receiving a kidney transplant . `` Imagine giving a 58-year-old man 27 years , '' she said Friday , looking across the room at Gillispie . `` To lay on a table for three hours , it 's nothing . `` I 'm excited . I 'm excited about the future -- and giving him a much longer future . '' Three weeks ago Mark Downey went to Lubbock to scout a junior college regional tournament that included Ranger . He and Gillispie sat together and talked basketball for a while , then the discussion turned to Ericka .

Ericka Downey , the Oklahoma mother of two and wife of Northeastern State University basketball coach Mark Downey , told The Dallas Morning News that she received confirmation Thursday from the Mayo Clinic that she will be able to donate one of her kidneys to Billy Gillispie .

( Nathan Hunsinger/The Dallas Morning News )
`` If you know Billy , he 's not really comfortable being emotional , '' Mark Downey said . `` And that day he got teary-eyed . `` I think he had a little sense of , ' I do n't deserve this . ' Probably kind of the same way I would feel . It was pretty neat to see that . And it helps me , too , to see that . '' Gillispie is in Stage 4 renal failure , with about 15 percent kidney function . Doctors told him that reaches Stage 5 , with only 10 percent function , he will have had to undergo dialysis . Thanks to Ericka , that 's not expected to be a concern now . During Ericka 's Mayo Clinic visit , staff members explained the psychological obstacle many donor-list patients face . The Mayo Clinic calls it The Big Ask . How does one make such a difficult request to relatives and friends ? Gillispie has been a bachelor since 1993 , when his only marriage ended , early in his coaching journey . `` As a coach , I 've always been totally independent , '' he said . `` As a person I 've always been totally independent . I 've never really depended on anyone for anything . I always took care of myself . `` I never would ask anybody for help . ''
Gillispie never had to make The Big Ask because Ericka Downey , a stranger , made The Big Offer . After the transplant it 's expected that Ericka will be able to return home after two days , while Gillispie will have to remain in Rochester , Minn. , for three weeks , to make sure there are no complications , including rejection of the new kidney .
If all goes well , Gillispie will return to the sideline at Ranger next season . `` As I always say , 'If the Good Lord is willing and the creek do n't rise , ' '' Gillispie said . `` You ca n't take your health for granted . I 've done that for too many years of my life , but I wo n't anymore . '' While Friday night 's gathering mostly was about basketball story-swapping , it also gave Billy and Ericka a chance to get to know each other personally . She told him she played basketball and softball in high school and softball at Arkansas Tech . There would be one more special moment , though . Ericka brought over her sons , each of whom got hugs from the famous coach they never had met . `` This is the guy , '' Ericka told them , `` that I 'm giving my kidney to . '' Her left one . From her good side .

ADO-EKITI—NATIONAL Chairman of the Progressives Congress , APC , Chief John Odigie- Oyegun , yesterday , told members of the party in Ekiti State that President Muhammadu Buhari will not rig or subvert the will of the electorate in the forthcoming governorship election .
Odigie-Oyegun said this while inaugurating the party 's Continuous Registration Exercise , at the APC secretariat in Ajilosun area of Ado-Ekiti .
Aspirants at the event included ; Chief Segun Oni , Senator Gbenga Aluko , Senator Ayo Arise , Wole Oluyede , Wole Oluleye , Capt Sunday Adebomi , Bimbo Daramola , Dr. Mojisola Yaya-Kolade , Victor Kolade , Mr. Kola Alabi , Mr. Diran Adesua , Dr. Bayo Oriire and Mr. Femi Bamisile .
Oyegun said : “ We must work hard to deserve the victory that will come to us . As you know , President Buhari wo n't alter or compromise the outcome of an election ; this shows Ekiti state will have a free and fair election , so we must be united and work hard to achieve victory together . ”
The APC chairman , who said the party will deploy every available resource to win the July 14 governorship election in Ekiti State , described the election as a ‘ must-win ' for the party .
Promising a free , fair and credible primary for the party , the party chairman ruled out the possibility of delegates ' list padding and other fraudulent practices that can impair the outcome of the May 5 primary .
His words : “ We will work hard to ensure that Ekiti returns to the progressive fold . Though we are in power at the centre , that does n't mean we should not work hard . President Muhammadu Buhari , as you know him , will not rig or compromise or subvert the will of the electorate , so we must work hard to deserve the victory that will come to us . ”
Dispelling the rumour of alleged plot to impose a particular aspirant on the party , Oyegun said : “ We have got your demands and we also want to tell you that we expect some things from you too while giving you assurances that there will be no imposition and that the primary shall be free , fair and credible .
“ To all the aspirants , you must not campaign as if there wo n't be tomorrow . Do n't campaign in a way that breeds enmity . I learned that you are over 30 aspirants , but the large number should n't be a source of discord .
“ Let me say this clearly , anybody who wants to fly the flag of our party must maintain decorum . But we shall be fair to you as much as possible because there ca n't be peace when justice is denied . We must not also have bad losers , you must work with whoever the electors pick as their candidate .

Chicago rapper Vic Mensa hit up LA Leakers over the weekend and threw a few shots many speculate were aimed at Kodak Black and Joey Badass .
Vic Mensa made it clear he 's sick of rappers comparing themselves to the late Tupac Shakur . Kodak and Joey , who 've recently had a few thoughts about Pac ( and Biggie ) , fit the bill for who Vic could be referring to .
Just a few months ago , Joey Badass got his ass handed to him by the Internet when he said in an interview with Genius : “ I already know I 'm a better rapper than 2Pac is . That 's just facts . One-on-one battle , I 'll flame Pac. ” When pretty much no one agreed , he clarified his comment on Twitter , saying : “ I was referring to rap skill . Bar for bar . Not accolades or influence… and I back myself 1000 times. ” Still , no one agreed .
Kodak 's comparison was n't as self-important , as it was ambitious . He told XXL last year for their Freshman Class issue , “ I 'm better than 2Pac and Biggie . I say that , so now you know where my head at . ”
Listen to Vic take aim at his peers just above .

It appears there are going to be plenty of reunions between Burton Albion and their former players in League One next season .
The latest Brewer to join a third-tier rival is Hope Akpan , who has signed a two-year deal at Bradford City after deciding not to take up a new contract with Albion .
Burton were keen to keep the Nigeria international at the Pirelli Stadium as they target an immediate return to the Championship - and Nigel Clough had suggested he could be `` a major player '' for them .
That much had been shown during a dominant run of form towards the end of the season , when he became a standout performer in a dynamic midfield trio , following an inconsistent and sometimes ineffective first half of 2017-18 , not helped by his signing late in pre-season .
( Image : James Wilson/Epic Action Imagery )
Another season of Akpan 's driving forward runs at the Pirelli was not to be , with the 26-year-old becoming the Bantams ' ninth signing of the summer .
He joins Tom Naylor in deciding to leave Albion at the end of his contract this off-season .
Naylor has moved to Portsmouth , another team seemingly building for a tilt at promotion into the Championship .
The former Derby County man had become a staple of Burton 's defence after three seasons in their midfield , and would likely have been the same again in League One .
Tom Flanagan , meanwhile , is preparing for the 2018-19 campaign with Sunderland , having joined the Black Cats after being transfer-listed by Burton following their relegation in May .
Sunderland and Portsmouth are among the early favourites for promotion next season , while Akpan 's Bradford will also fancy building on a 2017-18 season in which they held a top-six place until a post-Christmas slump .
It will be interesting to see how each of the moves work out for that trio of now ex-Brewers .
It is certainly possible that each could be battling it out with their former side for the same League One goal at the business end of the campaign .
That is what they all will hope .
All parties here are beginning the season with ambitions of breaking into the second tier .
Naylor and Flanagan have both spoken about their desire to get back into the Championship with their new sides after dropping out of it with their old one .
Akpan has spent the majority of his career in the Championship with Reading , Blackburn Rovers and Burton , so he will be striving to return to that level as soon as possible too .

Whether those players saw their promotion chances as being heightened elsewhere , only they could answer .
Myriad reasons go in to a player 's decision to move clubs .
While sides with similar ambitions to Burton have bolstered their ranks for the gruelling campaign ahead , Clough 's side have , for now at least , seen their numbers depleted .
It was inevitable that the playing staff would have to be streamlined after relegation , of course , and Clough has spoken about working with around 18 outfield players next season , including a clutch of their up-and-coming youngsters , who will be keen to impress and gain greater game time in 2018-19 .
But the Brewers boss wanted to maintain the bulk of his squad from the second tier , feeling they had shown in the late stages of last season what they were capable of if kept together .
There is still a spine there at the Pirelli , but the depth has been impacted with Akpan and Naylor 's moves , and that is something they will be trying to address in the transfer market .
Replacing that departed duo is crucial , because Albion are lacking options in midfield , an area they are focusing on in this window .
Look no further than Colorado to see just how the two-party duopoly really operates
By now , probably everyone reads this is already sick of America 's quadrennial political spectacle — the one in which politicians and media outlets ask us to believe that there remain vast differences between our two political parties . It 's like cheaply staged pornography on a red and blue set , with words like “ polarization , ” “ socialist ” and “ extremist ” comprising the breathless dialogue in a wholly unconvincing plot .
Some of this tripe can be momentarily compelling , of course . And as the 2012 election climax draws nearer , many Americans will no doubt submit to the fantasy . But before that happens , it 's worth looking a few levels beneath the orgiastic presidential campaign for a last necessary dose of nonfiction , if only to remind us that the parties are often two heads of the same political monster .
As good a place as any to get such a dose is my home state of Colorado , which this month provided two emblematic examples of how the two-party duopoly really operates .
Exhibit A is our Republican secretary of state , Scott Gessler . Though his job is to enforce campaign finance rules and protect voting rights , he 's proudly using his office for exactly the opposite .
After being elected in 2010 , Gessler first reduced campaign finance fines against the local Republican Party in Larimer County and then announced that he would headline a fundraiser to help that local party pay off the levies . Now , this GOP hack is suing the overwhelmingly Democratic bastion of Denver in an attempt to prevent ballots from being sent to 55,000 of the city 's registered voters . Gessler 's public rationale ? He says that because these citizens chose not to vote in the last election , they should n't get ballots this year .
Exhibit B is Democrat Tom Strickland — a flesh-and-blood monument to revolving-door corruption .
In the 1990s , Strickland got his start serving as Colorado 's U.S. attorney . He then slid into a lucrative job at one of Colorado 's top corporate law firms . A few years later , he jumped back into public service , making two failed Democratic bids for the U.S. Senate . From there , it was on to the executive vice presidency of UnitedHealth Group , one of the nation 's most rapacious health insurance companies .
When Barack Obama was elected president , Strickland headed back into government , as the chief of staff of the Interior Department — the agency that 's supposed to regulate the oil and gas industry . Then , last week , Strickland got himself a job at the law firm defending BP in the Deepwater Horizon spill .
Despite being tied to major issues and a crucially important electoral swing state , and despite the overtly public nature of their moves , Gessler and Strickland 's actions received almost no national media attention , which reminds us that these two political figures are not special cases — their behavior is today 's unquestioned norm .
Gessler represents both a bipartisan effort to undermine campaign finance regulations and a win-at-all-costs attitude that has become pervasive in American politics — in this case , his is the Republican kind that is aimed at suppressing the vote . Strickland , meanwhile , embodies the Democratic side of a permanent bipartisan elite that has made corporatism and public service completely synonymous . The two Coloradans may exemplify different pathologies , but those pathologies both contribute to our political system 's overarching dysfunction .
So the next time you tune into a cable TV pundit-a-thon or a talk-radio screamfest that tells you how “ divided ” American politics is , and how one party is so much more honorable than the other , remember Colorado and all the other examples like it before you head down the rabbit hole of election-year delusion .

Lagos – No fewer than 62 juvenile offenders and 67 inmates with disabilities held at Kirikiri Female Prisons and Kirikiri Medium Prisons , Lagos , were on Monday released on the orders of the State Chief Judge , Justice Olufunmilayo Atilade .
She said her intervention particularly at the Female Prisons was part of efforts to address the problem of underage offenders being locked up in prisons across the state .
Atilade had on Aug. 1 released 80 juvenile offenders held at Badagry Prison , Lagos , for sundry offences .
The juvenile inmates , who are below 18 years , were arrested and prosecuted by the Lagos State Task Force on Environmental and Various Offences such as hawking and breach of peace .
They are serving various prison terms after failing to pay fines imposed on them by the mobile courts across the metropolis .
During Monday 's visit to the Kirikiri Prison , Atilade released 13 underage girls from the female prison and 49 underage boys from the Medium Prison .
She said : “ I am here with my delegation comprising judges of the High Court , officials of the Ministry of Justice , Office of the Public Defender ( OPD ) and Directorate of Public Prosecutions ( DPP ) as well as other stakeholders .
“ We are here to address the issue of underage offenders in our prison , we need to look into the problem . ”
The Head of Family Court in the state , Justice Yetunde Idowu , in her address , restated the Lagos State Government 's “ zero tolerance ” for children in prison .
“ It does not give us pleasure to be here , the Chief Judge as well as other women here are mothers and grandmothers .
“ The Lagos State Government has zero tolerance for children in prison , you should be home with your families , ” she said .
Idowu admonished the underage inmates not do anything that will bring them back to the prisons .
The Head , Prison Decongestion Committee , Justice Oluwatoyin Ipaye , decried the condition of the children serving terms in the adult prison .
Describing the situation as very sad , she noted that in instances where children break the law they should be dealt with a “ lighter hand ” .
“ The team is here , My Lady , the Honourable Chief Judge , has signed the release warrants and what is important is that we do not see you here again . ”
Mrs Funlola Odunlami , the Lagos State Solicitor-General , said the state government had enacted laws that prohibited putting children in adult prisons .
Odunlami told the girls not to bow to peer pressure , pointing out that the state law forbids hawking .
Justice Atilade while releasing the 13 juveniles from the female prison , told the ecstatic girls to “ go and sin no more ” .
From the Kirikiri Female Prison , the Chief Judge made a stop-over at the Kirikiri Medium Prison to free more juvenile offenders and well as disabled inmates from custody .
NAN reports that the Kirikiri Medium Prison which has capacity for only 1 , 700 inmates , currently accommodates 3,816 inmates , of which 3,093 are awaiting trial , while 723 are convicted .
The chief judge said her visit was prompted by an ` SOS ' from Mrs Modupe Olubanwo , the Head of the Legal Team of the Fountain of Life Church .
She noted that the names of 81 juvenile offenders were submitted to the High Court for screening for release with 49 certified for release from custody .
To the 49 underage boys , Atilade said : “ Go and sin no more ” , and ordered the seven of the freed male juveniles be handed over to the officials of the Ministry of Youths and Social Welfare for supervision and rehabilitation .
While releasing the 67 inmates with physical disabilities , the chief judge said their release was on health grounds .
“ I have taken cognizance of the fact that 67 people living with disabilities are in the prison , I hereby release them on health grounds .
“ Those that have been convicted of their crimes will he handed over to the Ministry of Youths and Social Welfare for their empowerment and rehabilitation . ”
Earlier , in his address of welcome , the Deputy Controller of Prisons in charge of Medium Prison , Mr Emmanuel Oluwaniyi , praised the chief judge 's efforts in decongesting the prison .
“ This is the second time the Chief Judge is coming here to release inmates , the first time she released 64 inmates and this time we are hoping for the release of over 100 inmates .
“ We thank you for the mother we have found in you , the release of the inmates has reduced the pressure on the prison , ” Oluwaniyi said .
NAN also reports that the release of the inmates is in line with Section 1 ( 1 ) of the Criminal Justice Release from Custody Special Provisions Act , Laws of the Federation 2007 ( NAN ) .
This is why liberals are really mad at Scott Pruitt and demand his resignation – he 's demanding accountability and transparency in environmental science , something they did n't have to do before
Video follows .
Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt signed a proposed rule on Tuesday to prevent the agency from relying on scientific studies that do n't publish the underlying data .
“ The era of secret science at EPA is coming to an end , ” Pruitt said in a statement . “ The ability to test , authenticate , and reproduce scientific findings is vital for the integrity of rulemaking process . ”
Pruitt first announced his initiative to rid EPA of “ secret science ” in an exclusive interview with The Daily Caller News Foundation in March . The Obama administration relied on so-called “ secret science ” to justify billions of dollars worth of regulations .
“ Americans deserve to assess the legitimacy of the science underpinning EPA decisions that may impact their lives , ” Pruitt said .
EPA said the proposed rule would move the agency towards open data practices used by scientific journals and professional societies . The policy mirrors the HONEST Act introduced by Texas Republican Rep. Lamar Smith to end EPA 's use of “ secret science . ”
Smith and South Dakota Sen. Mike Rounds , who introduced the Senate version of the HONEST Act , spoke at the signing ceremony at EPA headquarters on Tuesday .
“ Today 's directive is a significant step toward making sure these decisions are not made behind closed doors with information accessible only to those writing the regulations , but rather in the full view of those who will be affected , ” Rounds said . “ Administrator Pruitt rightfully is changing business as usual and putting a stop to hidden agendas , ” Smith said .
Democrats and environmentalists oppose Pruitt 's data transparency rule , arguing it would restrict the scientific studies EPA could rely on for rulemaking and violate privacy rights of patients participating in health studies .
However , proponents of data transparency said researchers already have ways to share patient health data without violating privacy rights .
This sort of data is already routinely made public for research use , ” JunkScience.com publisher Steve Milloy wrote in a recent Wall Street Journal op-ed .

A FIFTH turn at Ekka glory has scored a young Warwick district farmer the top title of the Queensland Show circuit .
At just 18 , David Bartley secured the grand champion led steer at this year 's Ekka with a 14-month-old limousin steer weighing in at 594kg live weight .
David and dad Scott sold the beast to the Breakfast Creek Hotel in Brisbane for $ 56 a kilo dressed weight .
Speaking about his son 's success , Mr Bartley said David had done incredibly well to take out the champion beast .
`` The comment from the judge was 'this is the calf we 've been looking for all day ' , '' he said .
`` The feedback was that he was fit right through and had adequate fat cover .
`` He had won the grand champion on the hoof , and then won the carcasse competition for his class and the reserve champion heavy weight carcasse for the exhibition .
`` David 's been doing this on his own with my guidance behind him for the past couple of years so I 'm really glad he 's had a big win . ''
Mr Bartley said it could be tough to tell just how high bidders will go to secure a winning beast .
`` On the day you never know - I 've seen it go higher and I 've seen it go lower , '' he said .
`` There can be a fair bit of luck involved in it all but obviously on the day that was the steer that caught the judge 's eye . ''
After beginning his cattle showing career in high school , David is likely to continue in the agriculture industry .
`` David has been showing since Year 8 at Scots PGC College where he decided to join the Cattle Club , '' Mr Bartley said .
`` He 's only climbed the ladder from there , and from Year 10 onward going to Ekkas he keeps getting stronger and stronger .
`` He won Casino Beef Week last year and got Reserve Champion this year , just missing out by an edge .
`` At the same time he 's had a great support from two local icons , Travis Luscombe and Steve Hayward ; both are cattle judges , Travis mainly in the LED steers and Steve in stud cattle . ''
Mr Bartley said David , a fifth generation cattle farmer , was now under the tutelage of Mr Hayward on his Allora property .
`` He 's learning the bits and pieces , the general duties on a cattle property from Steve for the next 12 months , '' he said .
`` He 's been around cattle all his life on our property out near the Hermitage .
`` Way back our family used to have dairy cattle but moved over to beef cattle and now we have a speckle park stud and turn off angus cattle for beef .
`` When it comes to led steers though it really just comes down to the steer on the day - our champion steer was one that was offered to us by The Bluff Limousin Stud at Tenterfield and we were happy to take that opportunity . ''
Mr Bartley said since graduating , his son had myriad opportunities to choose from .
`` He 's been showing and really flourishing on his own but whether he continues may come down to finding balance between work , '' he said .
`` He 's got a passion for cattle there 's no doubt about that but which way his career goes will be up to him .
`` We 've had a lot of people calling and messaging to congratulate David and on his behalf I would just like to thank the people who have stood by him and supported him through the season , particularly our friends and relatives . ''
Will Naperville Riverwalk carillon tower have to come down ?
hello
Scott Sanders/ssanders @ dailyherald.comThe roof over Naperville 's carillon is 160 ft. above ground level , making it one of Naperville 's tallest structures .
Members of a Naperville panel that oversees the Riverwalk are seriously considering the possibility of decommissioning the tower that holds the Millennium Carillon after determining the structure faces issues with cracked concrete and corroded steel .
The Riverwalk Commission on Wednesday began reviewing an assessment of the structure before formulating a recommendation to the city council about what should be done with the 17-year-old Moser Tower , a 160-foot-tall spire that houses 72 chiming bells and has become an icon on the city 's skyline .
Commissioners brainstormed pros and cons of four options to address the structural problems found in the $ 50,000 assessment , in which engineers observed cracked and deteriorating concrete walls that could cause pieces to fall `` without notice , '' and corroded steel supports that could decrease stability .
The city could fix the structure and maintain it as is for $ 3 million ; fix it and enclose the base to help prevent future corrosion for $ 3.75 million ; maintain it for a while and then tear it down for $ 1.6 million ; or tear it down immediately for $ 660,000 .
`` None of the options are desirable , '' Riverwalk Commission Chairman Geoff Roehll said .
The commission is expected to debate the future of the tower until July or August , then recommend one of the options to the city council .
The council then will prioritize spending on tower repairs among all the other projects in its annual capital improvements plan , such as work on roads , bridges , electric service , water lines and sewer infrastructure .
The decision of what to do with the $ 7.1 million tower is n't an easy one , which is why the commission plans to take its time to seek community input .
`` This is a structure that does n't have to exist , '' said Judith Brodhead , who is the city council 's representative on the Riverwalk Commission . `` I have n't seen a lot of pushbacks to repairing this or caring for it . ''
The problem with the more expensive options -- repairing the tower and enclosing the lower 72 feet -- is the plans involve some risk and several unknowns , said Bill Novack , the city 's director of transportation , engineering and development .
The city does n't yet know if the cracking and corrosion are getting worse , or staying basically unchanged . It 's also unknown how much weather will continue to affect the structure , or how effective repairs would be .
`` There 's no guarantee this will really extend the life of the tower , '' Novack said .
Some Riverwalk commissioners said they worry about fiscal responsibility and how to respect the money donors gave to the tower and carillon , while also acknowledging the city 's financial needs .
Commissioner John Joseph said maintaining the structure as-is , with plans to decommission it when maintenance becomes too costly , is the `` safest option . '' Yet others said that would constitute kicking the can down the road .
`` It 's going to boil down to , 'How important is this structure to Naperville ? ' '' Brodhead said .
Although she described the tower as `` somewhat troubled , '' possibly for its previous issues with falling concrete in the early 2000s , Brodhead said it 's an important part of Naperville 's image , reputation , identity and appearance . So preserving it , not just decommissioning it , also should be strongly considered .
But in a survey of Riverwalk users completed earlier this year , preserving the Moser Tower and Millennium Carillon came in last among four potential projects . When people were asked to choose their top priority , it earned 16 percent of votes .
Projects people preferred include building a park at 430 S. Washington St. , just south of the DuPage River near the Burger King , which received 38 percent of votes ; extending the Riverwalk south to Hillside Avenue , which got 27 percent of votes ; and constructing ADA ramps at the Eagle Street Bridge , which got 19 percent .
Commission Chairman Roehll said he wishes spending on the tower would n't have to detract from these other ideas . Fixing the tower , he says , wo n't create any noticeable improvements to the experience along the Riverwalk . It will simply keep things they way they are . And for how long , it 's impossible to tell .
`` We 'll spend that money and we 'll still have a carillon . It 'll be exactly the way it is today . Period , '' Roehll said . `` It 's kind of a lose/lose scenario . You spend the money and get exactly what you have . ''

Unsurprisingly , Nick Young , one of the goofiest guys on the Warriors , had fun talking about social media burner accounts at NBA Finals media day on Wednesday . Reporters were trying to see if any of the Warriors or Cavaliers would share their thoughts on the absolutely insane Twitter scandal rocking the 76ers right now .
The Ringer dropped a huge story on Tuesday night about their investigation into five anonymous Twitter accounts , and how four of them have criticized the Sixers and specific players , among other things . The report concluded that the accounts are linked to 76ers president of basketball operations Bryan Colangelo . Colangelo told USA TODAY Sports he does n't know anything about the four accounts that have been critical of his franchise .
Young , who has had social media snafus of his own over the years , laughed when asked about giving advice to NBA execs caught with burner accounts . He went on to say , “ No comment , ” before joking that they could just say they were hacked .
Nick Young 's advice for NBA executives who might have their burner accounts caught ? “ No comment . I got hacked. ” Does he have a burner account ? “ A burner account ? Nah . I just like to get hacked a lot. ” — Tania Ganguli ( @ taniaganguli ) May 30 , 2018
Young was then asked if he himself has any burner accounts to which he laughed some more and joked , “ Nah , I just like to get hacked a lot . ”
Swaggy P , asked if he has a burner account : “ Nah , I just like to get hacked a lot ” pic.twitter.com/f1xvcC6vPp — Sports Illustrated ( @ SInow ) May 30 , 2018
Young happily used the “ I was hacked ” excuse last year when fans uncovered his old tweets that trash-talked the Warriors shortly after he signed with Golden State .
I hate 2016 GS fans … They dnt know nothing about basketball — Nick Young ( @ NickSwagyPYoung ) June 11 , 2016
Nick Young jokes that his phone was hacked when he tweeted , `` I hate 2016 GS fans '' during last year 's NBA Finals . pic.twitter.com/kwUQow9ToR — 95.7 The Game ( @ 957thegame ) July 7 , 2017
You can always count on Swaggy P for an entertaining response — well , him and Joel Embiid .
Red Bull has made clear yet again that it wants Daniel Ricciardo to stay at the team .
While Max Verstappen struggles , Australian Ricciardo is in top form but out of contract at the end of 2018 .
`` He 's made himself a few million more expensive , '' 2016 world champion Nico Rosberg smiled after Ricciardo won at Monaco .
Lewis Hamilton agreed , saying : `` I hear he earns less ( than Verstappen ) , even though he does more . He 's currently the leader at Red Bull . ''
Red Bull boss Christian Horner said the team wants Ricciardo to stay .
`` Daniel knows the capabilities of the team , he sees how well the team suits him , and I hope that in the next few months we will settle all the issues , '' he said .
However , Ricciardo remains linked with a potential switch to Mercedes or Ferrari .
Red Bull 's Dr Helmut Marko told Auto Bild after Monaco : `` For us , nothing changes .
`` We want to keep him and Daniel knows it . Why should he go to Mercedes or Ferrari ? To be a number 2 driver ?
`` With us , Daniel has equal opportunities with the same equipment and no team orders . I think he knows that too , '' he added .
Marko said he wants to get a new contract signed `` as soon as possible '' .
The United States on Tuesday called for an emergency United Nations Security Council ( UNSC ) meeting to discuss the recent mortar attacks fired from Gaza into Israel .
The meeting is scheduled to take place on Wednesday afternoon , as per a statement from the US mission to the UN .
The emergency meeting has been called after US ambassador to the UN , Nikki Haley lambasted the Palestinians for the rocket attacks , calling them “ militants ” , The Hill reported .
“ The recent attacks out of Gaza are the largest we have seen since 2014 . Mortars fired by Palestinian militants hit civilian infrastructure , including a kindergarten . ”
On a related note , at least five people were injured after rockets were reportedly fired in the yard of an empty kindergarten near the Gaza Border on Tuesday .
“ The Security Council should be outraged and respond to this latest bout of violence directed at innocent Israeli civilians , and the Palestinian leadership needs to be held accountable for what they 're allowing to happen in Gaza , ” Haley added .
Approximately 70 rockets and mortars were reportedly fired by the Hamas and other militant groups towards Israel on Tuesday morning .
The Israeli military said in a statement that this was the “ biggest rocket and mortar attack launched from Gaza since 2014 . ”
The Israeli Defence Forces ( IDF ) further said that its air defence system intercepted over two dozen projectiles from Gaza . The forces responded against the militants by launching dozens of airstrikes in Gaza .
Earlier , the Israeli military shelled a Hamas-run checkpoint in the northern Gaza Strip on Monday , killing a Palestinian and injuring one .
Earlier this month , a large number of Palestinians gathered to protest on the Gaza Strip 's eastern border to commemorate the Nakba anniversary and protest the relocation of the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem .
In the clashes between Israel and Palestine at the Gaza Strip , at least 65 Palestinian demonstrators lost their lives and more than hundreds were injured .
Unidentified Palestinians were killed when Israeli soldiers opened fire at the eastern border of al-Bureij refugee camp in central Gaza .

Scott Dudelson/WireImage ( MIAMI ) — Comedian Hannibal Buress was arrested Saturday night in Miami for disorderly intoxication after a reported encounter with police .
In the arrest report , obtained by ABC News , the officer says that Buress approached him and asked him to call an Uber for him . When the officer declined Buress ' request , the comedian allegedly became “ angry and belligerent , ” and refused to leave the area , which prompted the officer to arrest him .
The Miami Herald reports that Burress was booked into a Miami-Dade couty jail early Sunday morning and posted bail a few hours later . His arrest was captured on social media in a viral video that was later posted on YouTube . In the video , Burress is seen handcuffed as he talks to officers .
“ What am I detained for ? ” Buress repeatedly asks in the video . “ I 'm not doing anything , I 'm not getting in the car . You do n't have probable cause for anything and you look hella stupid right now , ” he says , before an officer leads Buress into a cop car .
Perhaps in response to the incident , Burress tweeted a GIF on Sunday afternoon that showed him coming through a paper screen . “ HANNIBAL BUSTIN ' THROUGH , ” the caption reads .
In addition to his stand-up comedy , Buress has multiple acting credits which includes his role on Broad City and being featured in films like Baywatch , Daddy 's Home and Spider-Man : Homecoming .

Why James Harden is MVP over Russell Westbrook ; do any Mavs make Eddie Sefko 's NBA awards lists ? Share This Story On ... Twitter

Ronald Martinez/Getty Images James Harden ( left ) and Russell Westbrook talk during during practice for the 2017 NBA All-Star Game at the Mercedes-Benz Superdome on Feb. 18 , 2017 in New Orleans .
By Eddie Sefko , Staff Writer Contact Eddie Sefko on Twitter : @ ESefko
OK , all of you Russell Westbrook fans out there , this is your chance . Twitterverse and email are at your disposal . We 're here to tell you why the Oklahoma City point guard is not the NBA 's most valuable player this season .
Future Mavericks ? The NBA 's top 20 free agents in 2017
First , it must be said there is no wrong answer in this debate . It 's impossible to have a problem with anybody who voted for Westbrook . And those of us who voted for James Harden , we can point to the Houston Rockets ' record and the fact that Harden 's numbers simply are n't much different than Westbrook 's . But his team 's record is way different . And for a team that was an afterthought going into the season , the big turnaround has to be taken into consideration . A 13-game improvement to reach 55 wins is outrageous when your biggest offseason acquisition was coach Mike D'Antoni . The Thunder won eight fewer games than the previous season . And by the way , in any regular season , Kawhi Leonard would be a worthy MVP choice . And we all know you can vote for LeBron James every year and not get laughed at . With all that said , here is our official NBA awards ballot as submitted last week to the league . Note : Mavericks are bold . Our ballot : Harden , Westbrook , Leonard , James , Isaiah Thomas . Coach of the year
Jason Miller/Getty Images Washington coach Scott Brooks
This probably was the most contentious of all the awards . There are a half-dozen qualified candidates , and we wrestled with how in the world we could leave Brad Stevens off our ballot , but we did . The Boston Celtics improved by five wins this season and they have an MVP candidate in Thomas . We also considered Dwane Casey and Quin Snyder , but in the end , the job Scott Brooks did with the Washington Wizards this season was most impressive . Our ballot : Brooks , D'Antoni , Steve Kerr . Rookie of the year
Jamie Squire/Getty Images Milwaukee 's Malcolm Brogdon .
The Philadelphia 76ers were hurt this year by having two candidates , Joel Embiid and Dario Saric . Since Embiid got hurt and played only 31 games , he was eliminated . And Saric was a viable candidate . But not viable enough . Our ballot : Malcolm Brogdon , Saric , Yogi Ferrell . Yes , you can criticize me as playing favorites with Ferrell , who also only played about half the season . But what he did in that time was too impressive to overlook in what is a relatively weak rookie crop . Most-improved player
Dan Mullan/Getty Images Denver 's Nikola Jokic .
This one was a no-brainer , even though there were quite a few players who took big leaps this season . Our ballot : Nikola Jokic , Devin Booker , Harrison Barnes . Defensive player of the year
Ronald Cortes/Getty Images San Antonio 's Kawhi Leonard ( left ) oand Golden State 's Draymond Green .
We 're more industrious than just taking the leaders in steals and blocked shots . It was a close call between Leonard and Draymond Green . Both of them can guard multiple positions and can shut down just about anybody . Our ballot : Leonard , Green , Rudy Gobert . Sixth man of the year
Harry How/Getty Images Houston 's Eric Gordon ( right ) .
It 's hard to come up with original ideas on this one . So few players fall into the category of league-approved sixth men anymore . But the rules say we have to come up with three of them , so we did . Our ballot : Eric Gordon , Jamal Crawford , Lou Williams . All-rookie teams
Tom Fox/Staff Photographer Dallas Mavericks guard Yogi Ferrell .
This is when you find out that you really do n't know as much about the NBA as you think you do . Just naming 10 rookies is a challenge . Finding 10 that deserve to be on either the first or second teams is like finding a gullible person at a skeptics convention . Our ballot : First team : Brogdon , Embiid , Saric , Buddy Hield , Ferrell . Second team : Kris Dunn , Jamal Murray , Brandon Ingram , Marquese Chriss , Domantas Sabonis . All-defensive teams
Ashley Landis/Staff Photographer Dallas Mavericks guard Wesley Matthews ( 23 ) .
We were blessed to watch Wesley Matthews put the stopper on Damian Lillard and Jimmy Butler to win games this season . And his overall grit is deserving of a first-team nod . Our ballot : First team : Leonard , Green , Gobert , Matthews , Giannis Antetokounmpo . Second team : Trevor Ariza , Jimmy Butler , Hassan Whiteside , Tony Allen , John Wall . All-NBA teams
Ashley Landis/Staff Photographer Mavericks forward Dirk Nowitzki ( 41 ) tries to block the shot of Cleveland forward LeBron James ( 23 ) during the first quarter of their game on Jan.12 , 2016 at the American Airlines Center in Dallas .
First team : Leonard , James , Anthony Davis , Harden , Westbrook . Second team : Karl-Anthony Towns , Antetokounmpo , Gobert , Wall , Steph Curry . Third team : Kevin Durant , Butler , Jokic , DeMar DeRozan , Thomas .

Skyblivion is a project by a volunteer team of modders to recreate the map for The Elder Scrolls IV : Oblivion inside Skyrim . It 's been years in the making , dating back to 2012 , and the team recently released an updated trailer to showcase their accomplishments so far . Their progress will give you a new appreciation for some of the more subtle differences between how the two games depict nature .
The video 's main focus is on the Imperial City in Cyrodiil , the province Oblivion takes place in. “ You will be able to spot new colorful weathers , new trees and flora , new clothing , new custom designed weapons , NPC schedules , remade textures and models , custom made creatures using custom behaviors and animations , ” the team says in the video 's description . It makes sense that things are slightly warmer south of Skyrim , but the temperate climate comes through in ways that go beyond the obvious lack of snow . Complimentary colors abound—greens and reds , yellows and purples—and the vegetation filters much of the light to make the sun feel more like a comforting glow lamp than a distant fluorescent bulb .
“ So obviously when recreating Cyrodiil you have to look closely at the original game and supplement all the visuals there with common known lore of the different regions and biomes in the province , ” Kyle Rebel , the project 's development lead , told Kotaku in an email . “ A general rule of thumb for Cyrodiil is that the province should have a high fantasy feeling where the grass is green , the trees and bushes are lush , flowers are in bloom all year round and the temperature is always a perfect 22 degrees Celsius . ”
The environments are verdant and borderline paradisiacal , beautiful in a way that 's distinct , though not necessarily better , from the gravelly mountains and austere snowscapes of Skyrim . One of the challenges for Skyblivion ( of which there are many , including working with an all-volunteer staff ) is to remake Oblivion using the Skyrim engine without the former simply melding into and becoming derivative of the latter .
Striking this balancing act requires , among other things , an acute attention to bushes and trees . “ So let 's for instance take the Heartlands which is the area all around the Imperial City isle , ” said Rebel . “ This area is very lush and green compared to Skyrim , so instead of pine trees this area is filled with big healthy oak trees and smaller types of trees all filled with a healthy looking collection of leaves . When you look at your feet you see light green grass and little flowers here and there poking through . The bushes in the area are thick and often covered in pink , purple , white and red flowers. ” Rebel considers the Sequoioideae to be Oblivion 's most iconic piece of vegetation , but he also has a soft spot for the maples that surround the island on which the Imperial City sits .

Of course , the leaves on a red oak or the flowers blooming on a rose bush are n't anything without good lighting . “ The clear sunrise behind the Imperial City that we showed in the update trailer has to be my favorite , ” said Rebel . “ Seeing the sky turn from black to pink as the sun slowly rises is simply a wonder to look at and actually makes me question why Bethesda did n't put more time and effort into the weathers of Skyrim . There is so much that can be done with proper lighting in a game. ” In this regard he credits modder Stayd , the team 's “ lighting and weather god . ”
While the latest trailer looks promising , Skyblivion is still a ways off from release . A stream discussing the mod 's progress in more detail is planned for the not too distant future to help raise money for charity . Although on paper that finished product is supposed to simply be a world in which the two games sit side-by-side , Rebel wants to capture the unique feel and contrast between the two different types of environments . “ I personally look at Skyrim 's level design a lot and real life references , ” he said . “ We all see these amazing pictures of landscapes around the globe that just make you think ‘ 'these places ca n't be real , they look like they are ripped out of a movie , ' which is exactly what we are trying to achieve with our work . Jaw-dropping beauty in the form of pixels on your screen . ”
With the epic failures of Android lines such as the Galaxy , it seemed like the path was clear for the iPhone to re-establish its dominance over the smartphone industry . But when Google announced it was releasing its Pixel smartphone , consumers deci ...
While fishing boiler rocks last weekend along the north side of Frazer Point , on the west end of Santa Cruz Island , I saw a very large bird sitting on the rocky ledge of the point and watching us with the unmistakable eyes of a wild predator .
Sure , it may just have been resting and watching us out of curiosity , but you have n't been looked at until you 've been looked through-and-through by the eyes of a large predator . It creates one of those moments when you ponder your position in the food chain .
The passengers saw me looking up at the ledge and looked for themselves . One noted that the big bird had a tag on its wing . That made me believe it was a young bald eagle , possibly hatched and raised on the island on one of the specially created bald eagle nesting devices . Being young , its head was still brown . I was fairly confident , but needed to see more of the bird .
As if on queue , the big bird opened up its wings , leaned into the air and lifted itself seemingly effortlessly into flight . The impressive size of that bird confirmed its identity without a doubt . No other bird out there has the size and the awesome , majestic character of the bald eagle . It made a semi-circular flight nearly over us and then went winging toward Christys Ranch . The big bay out front probably offers plenty of opportunities for snatching a fish from the sea . I know it does for me !
It 's great having bald eagles back on the Channel Islands . The process was long and difficult . It began with planning and funding . Golden eagles , which had taken up residence and were hard on the population of island kit foxes , had to be captured and transported far enough eastward that they would not come back . Then bald eagles were reintroduced and special nesting towers erected .
The National Park Service worked hard on the project , with cooperation from The Nature Conservancy and the Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary . Good work , folks . We 're enjoying the results !

AMES , Iowa — The Cyclones might remember Sunday 's game as the “ Hawkeye Hangover ”
Iowa State survived anyway , pushing its winning streak to seven games ahead of a key matchup against Northern Iowa .
Donovan Jackson scored 25 points , including a career-high seven 3s , Cameron Lard had 15 points with 11 rebounds and Iowa State held off lowly Alcorn State 78-58 .
Lindell Wigginton scored 16 points for the Cyclones ( 7-2 ) , who were forced to rally from an early 9-point deficit against arguably the worst team on their schedule .
“ In the first half , we did n't play with any energy , ” Jackson said . “ In the second half , we knew we could n't get beat . ”
The Cyclones , fresh off an emotional home win over rival Iowa , were sluggish — to say the least — from the opening tip . Alcorn State ( 2-8 ) took advantage , knocking down four of their first five tries from 3-point range for a 14-5 lead .
Though Iowa State eventually grabbed a slim lead , Dante Sterling 's 4-point play with 55.4 seconds left in the first half helped the Braves stay within 33-32 by the break .
Iowa State 's talent eventually won out .
It opened the second half on a 15-3 run , highlighted by 3s from Jackson and Wigginton , to push the lead to 48-35 with 15:33 left . The Cyclones held a relatively comfortable lead for the rest of the game , outscoring the overwhelmed Braves 45-26 in the second half .
“ We talked about it the last two days about not having a letdown , a setback . We really tried to fight against that , ” Iowa State coach Steve Prohm said . “ Fortunate to win , but without question we have a lot of things to clean up . ”
Devon Brewer scored 15 points for Alcorn State .
THE BIG PICTURE :
Iowa State : This edition of the Cyclones is n't good enough to play unfocused basketball and expect to win — and never was that more evident than on Sunday . Creighton beat this same Alcorn State team by 37 , and UNI beat the Braves by 28 .
Alcorn State : The Braves have n't beaten a Division I school in non-conference play since 2012 , so this result was hardly a shocker . Alcorn State was also without star senior Reginald Johnson , the preseason SWAC Player of the Year . He broke his right leg last week in a loss at Tulane and is expected to be out for the season .
BRASE FOR IMPACT
The Braves were a breakaway layup from making it a 10-point game with just fewer than five minutes left when senior Hans Brase blocked the shot and got the Cyclones out running for a possession that ended in a Brase 3 . Brase , a graduate transfer from Princeton marred by knee issues throughout his career , has been a nice addition to a promising but young frontcourt . He finished with five points , nine rebounds and three blocks . “ Did n't quit on the play…made a great block , ” Prohm said .
KEY NUMBERS
Nick Weiler-Babb 's streak of games with at least 10 assists ended at four . Weiler-Babb had nine assists on Sunday to go with five rebounds and four points . Weiler-Babb also had five turnovers in his worst game since moving to point guard in mid-November …Lard earned his second double-double despite playing just 19 minutes . “ He 's a very talented kid who is barely at the surface of what he can be , ” Prohm said . …Alcorn State finished 8 of 26 on 3s despite that hot start .
UP NEXT
Iowa State and Northern Iowa will square off on Saturday in Des Moines .
Alcorn State hosts Fisk on Tuesday .
The Kaduna State Primary Health Care Development Agency ( SPHCDA ) said on Friday that 17 , 989 cases of severe acute malnutrition were recorded in the state in 2017 .

The official , however , said that the percentage of wasted children was “ a fair percentage compared to that of Nigeria in which 31.5 % are wasted . ''
She disclosed that KADENAP in collaboration with UNICEF have spent about N750 million on the purchase of Ready to Use Therapeutic Food ( RTUF ) to treat malnutrition .
Meanwhile , during a field trip to Kugu Primary Health Centre in Zaria by the workshop participants , the Nutrition Focal Officer , Lawal Jibril said over 4,000 children suffering from severe acute malnutrition were admitted since 2016 .

Request Report Brochure @ https : //www.transparencymarketresearch.com/sample/sample.php ? flag=B & rep_id=20819
Iron Sulfate heptahydrate is also known as copperas or green vitriol ( blue-green heptahydrate ) . Sulfate is a co-product of the manufacturing process of titanium dioxide . Crystallization of hot Sulfate solution can also yield iron Sulfate heptahydrate , upon cooling . Iron Sulfate produced in this process is iron Sulfate heptahydrate ( copperas ) with free moisture content of at least 4 % . Iron crystals in copperas tend to stick to one another , leading to the product becoming dusty . The acid liquid present in copperas tends to leach out and potentially attack the container in which copperas is stored . Iron Sulfate heptahydrate has iron content ranging from 18 weight % to 20 weight % and free acid content of 3 weight % at the maximum , based on the total weight of iron Sulfate heptahydrate . As discussed , in addition to iron , iron Sulfate heptahydrate also comprises an acidic compound such as sulfuric acid . The acidic compound is typically a result of the formation of iron Sulfate heptahydrate .
Iron Sulfate Heptahydrate Market : Dynamics and Trends
The hydrated form of iron Sulfate heptahydrate is used medically to treat iron deficiency and also for industrial applications . The World Health Organization ( WHO ) has published a list of essential medicines . As per the list , iron Sulfate heptahydrate is one of the most important medicines required for basic health . Historically , iron sulfate heptahydrate was used in the textile industry as a textile dye fixative , to blacken leather , and also as a constituent of ink . Iron chlorosis affects the fruit cultivation to a great extent . Iron Sulfate heptahydrate is used to treat iron chlorosis .
Read Report Overview @ https : //www.transparencymarketresearch.com/iron-sulfate-heptahydrate-market.html

PHOENIX — Adam Duvall 's grand slam erased an early four-run deficit , and the Cincinnati Reds rallied to beat the Arizona Diamondbacks 7-4 on Wednesday .
Scott Schebler added a tiebreaking two-run drive in the sixth , helping the last-place Reds salvage the finale of the three-game set . Joey Votto and Eugenio Suarez each had three hits .
Both of Cincinnati 's homers came off Patrick Corbin ( 5-2 ) , who gave up a season-high six runs and eight hits in six innings .
Paul Goldschmidt and John Ryan Murphy went deep for the Diamondbacks , who have dropped 16 of 20 overall .
Cincinnati right-hander Sal Romano ( 3-6 ) pitched five innings in his first win since May 4 , yielding four runs and seven hits . He was 0-3 with a 12.79 ERA in his previous three starts .
Raisel Iglesias got four outs for his ninth save in his first appearance since being sidelined by a biceps injury . Pinch hitter Daniel Descalso and Jarrod Dyson singled to start the ninth but Goldschmidt fouled out , Duvall made a sliding grab of Jake Lamb 's sinking liner to left and Murphy popped out .
Corbin was cruising with a 4-0 lead when Tucker Barnhart and Votto opened the fourth with singles and Suarez walked on a 3-2 pitch to load the bases . That brought up Duvall , who hit a drive into the seats in left-centre for his second career grand slam .
Suarez opened the sixth with a single , Duvall struck out and Schebler launched a shot 433 feet to right .
It was a disappointing finish for Arizona after a fast start .
Dyson led off the first with a single and Goldschmidt , moved up to second in the batting order in recent games , knocked Romano 's 1-1 pitch into the visitor 's bullpen for his seventh homer of the season . After Jake Lamb flew out , Murphy doubled to the left-centre gap and scored on David Peralta 's single , sliding in just ahead of Billy Hamilton 's throw from short centre field .

Aston Villa are reportedly keeping close tabs on QPR and Australia midfielder Massimo Luongo .
The reports come from the 25-year-old 's home country .
Here 's a quick lowdown on the player who was previously linked with the club .
The stats
Date of birth : 25th September 1992 ( 25 )
Born : Sydney , New South Wales
Position : Midfielder
Height : 5ft 9 ''
Supports : Inter Milan
Youth career : APIA Leichhardt Tigers and Spurs
Shirt number : 21
Playing career
He started his career at Spurs in the youth teams but never made a league appearance . He made his only Spurs appearance in a Leage Cup defeat against Stoke City in 2011 , he missed a penalty that led to defeat .
During his time at Spurs he was loaned out to Ipswich and Swindon Town , the latter signed him on a permanent deal in 2013 after he impressed on loan .
He played 76 times for Swindon scoring 10 times before signing for QPR in a £3.5m switch on a three year deal .
To date he has 102 appearances for QPR .
Playing style
A box-to-box midfielder with plenty of energy in the tank . The kind of industrious midfielder that any teams wants at the heart of their midfield . He has enjoyed a fine season so far for QPR .
A skillfull player who is very comfortable with the ball at his feet and even more comfortable getting the ball off other people . He adds an important shield to the defence and is quick and neat with his distribution .
He has made 43 appearances so far this season with six goals and 3 assists . On whoscored.com he has an average rating of 7.32 .
Why would Villa want him ?
The big thing is what division Villa will be in . Much of their spending prowess and ability to attract players will depend on that .
If they were in the Championship , he would be a real asset , no doubt about that .
If they were in the Premier League they would both be looking to make an impact together .
He is a player who looks ready to make that step-up and has the kind of industrious nature that Steve Bruce likes in a midfielder .
Villa has an ageing side and and someone like Luongo would be perfect to freshen things up .
Luongo was on Villa 's radar as a Swindon Town player in the summer of 2015 when Tim Sherwood looked to rebuild his squad after the departures of Fabian Delph and Christian Benteke .
He 's gone on to make over 100 appearances at Championship level and has begun to find the net , too - he 's scored four goals in his last ten games .
“ Joining QPR is probably my best chance to play regularly , assuming that I impress and give them a reason to pick me , ” the midfielder said upon signing for the Rs .
“ With the players and resources they have at West Brom and Villa , they could probably afford to buy a bigger squad and maybe opportunities may have been limited . ”
Sherwood agreed with the decision of the player he knew through working with him at Spurs . He said at the time : “ It 's not the right time for us to do the deal , I think it is a good move for him and it will give them the opportunity to play regularly . ”
QPR sporting director Les Ferdinand has previously conceded that it 'd be hard to keep hold of Luongo if he started adding goals to his game on a more regular basis - something he appears to be doing currently .
Steve Bruce is well stocked in midfield , though - Conor Hourihane and Glenn Whelan are regulars in the middle of the pitch , while Mile Jedinak , Birkir Bjarnason and Henri Lansbury have all played parts in Villa 's rise into the promotion reckoning after a slow start .
Is there anyone else interested ?
They could face competition for Luongo signature in the form of Malaga and Crystal Palace with both sides also having been linked .
Luongo has two years left to run on his contract at Loftus Road with speculation over his future expected to continue as the World Cup approaches .
More Villa news
Aston Villa have announced that they will end their partnership with kit manufacturers Under Armour at the end of the current season - just two years into the five-year contract they agreed in 2016 .
Under Armour replaced Macron upon relegation to the Championship - Macron had supplied the claret and blue strips for four years .
The club signed a five-year deal with Under Armour , but that association has been ended three years prematurely .
A statement from the claret and blues ' Twitter account read : “ Aston Villa can confirm that the club and its technical partner , Under Armour , have mutually decided to end their relationship .
“ The club would like to thank Under Armour for their support over the past two years and would like to wish them all the best for the future . ”
It remains to be seen at this stage which brand the club will turn to ahead of the 2018-19 campaign .
Villa , sitting in fourth , retain aspirations of being in the Premier League next term .

Viewers of BBC One drama The Moorside were left torn over Karen Matthews on Tuesday night .
The two-part minidrama culminated with an episode at 9pm on BBC One .
Some of those tuning in were quick to blast the mother - played by Gemma Whelan - for kidnapping , drugging and imprisoning her own daughter Shannon Matthews .
But others confessed they felt sorry for her .
Those tuning in at home could n't help but notice the portrayal of the character suggested that Karen was n't perhaps as evil as they previously thought .
( Photo : BBC )
`` I get that perhaps Karen has special needs , '' wrote one .
`` Bit slow .
`` Naive and stupid .
`` Does n't excuse her behaviour or knowing right from wrong # Moorside . ''
( Photo : BBC )
Another then posted : `` R u still my friend ?
`` Shows Karen functions as a child .
`` I feel sorry 4 her .
`` Now they 're hanging Julie out 2 dry # Moorside . ''
( Photo : PA )
Shortly afterwards , a different viewer wrote : `` If this is a true portrayal of Karen Matthews she seemed quite child-like and naive .
`` Equally tragic and disturbing . # Moorside . ''
Moments later , another wrote : `` If the portrayal of Karen Matthews is accurate she 's clearly very damaged .
`` Child like , vulnerable , learning difficulties # Moorside . ''
In reality , Karen does not suffer with learning disabilities .
However , it was pointed out in the hour-long episode that she was dealing with the trauma of being sexually abused since her childhood .
Karen 's accomplice in the kidnapping Michael Donovan did have learning difficulties though and half the average IQ .
In court , both were both found guilty of kidnapping , false imprisonment and perverting the course of justice and were sentenced to eight years imprisonment .
Karen was released on licence in April 2012 .
The family of a corporal in the Irish Defence Forces say they have registered as homeless after being refused rented accommodation in the Newbridge , Co Kildare area by landlords unwilling to accept the Housing Assistance Payment ( HAP ) .
The Wives & Partners of the Defence Forces group ( WPDF ) called on the Taoiseach to “ evaluate and critique ” the payment as landlords near where the corporal works in the Curragh were refusing to rent to the family .
The corporal , who has chosen to remain anonymous , has worked with the Defence Forces for 17 years and is due to be posted overseas in the autumn . He earns €519 per week and his partner works part-time .
The family say their former landlord was “ more than helpful and reasonable ” when he got in touch last January to inform them he was selling the home . They were given until July 31st to find a new place to live and were then given another month when they failed to find alternative housing in Newbridge .
The corporal 's partner said the family needed to find a home close to the local GP who provides care for their daughter who suffers from a rare genetic disorder called Apert syndrome .
“ If my daughter did n't have Apert syndrome , it would n't bother me where we live but she goes to school in the Curragh and has a fantastic SNA [ special needs assistant ] there , ” she said . “ They 're aware of all her medical problems . My partner is in the Curragh camp and is only five minutes away if anything happens to her .
“ My eldest is aware of what 's going on and it 's dragging me down , it 's breaking my heart . My partner works full-time , I work part-time , and we 're homeless ? It 's absolutely horrific . ”
The corporal said he was “ worried sick ” about the situation . “ I work damn hard and my family does n't deserve to be homeless . I do n't know what to do or where to turn to . ”
Housing assistance
The WPDF says the “ poor wages ” in the Defence Forces meant the family was eligible for the Housing Assistance Payment . With the additional HAP support the family can afford to pay €1,200 per month in rent .
According to the corporal 's partner , one landlord refused to rent to the family because of a negative experience with previous tenants on rent support .
“ He said if there 's one glitch in the payment , it takes so long to get the payment set back up again . ”
The HAP scheme was introduced with the objective of easing the housing crisis and as a means of replacing rent supplement allowance . Unlike rent supplement , recipients can remain on the scheme even if they have full-time employment .
The WPDF says it has contacted the Minister of Defence suggesting the family stay temporarily in one of the unoccupied houses in the Curragh Camp .
A spokeswoman for the Department of Defence said the vacant properties were in “ an extremely poor state of repair and some are bordering on dereliction ” . She said the department could assist families in applying for social housing and housing assistance and that Defence Forces personnel support services were also available if required .
It seems like it goes without saying…but we 'll say it anyway . Do n't roast marshmallows over an active volcano . Someone actually asked that of the USGS . They asked quote : @ USGSVolcanoes Is it safe to roast marshmallows over volcanic vents ? Assuming you had a long enough stick , that is ? Or would the resulting marshmallows be poisonous ? @ JimGriffith_SV @ DrFunkySpoon
The agency replied : “ Erm , we 're going to have to say no , that 's not safe . ( Please do n't try ! ) ” If the vent is emitting a lot of SO2 or H2S , they would taste BAD . And if you add sulfuric acid ( in vog , for example ) to sugar , you get a pretty spectacular reaction .

Of course , it did n't take long for us to find a video of someone roasting a marshmallow over a volcano . This video was taken a few years ago . Kids—do n't try this at home !

People in Birmingham are one-and-a-half times more likely to be diagnosed with HIV but numbers are falling .
There were 16 new diagnoses for every 100,000 people aged 15 and over in the area in 2016 , 1.5 times the England rate of 10.3 per 100,000 people .
However , the rate of new diagnoses has fallen from 19.4 per 100,000 in 2015 , with the numbers of people newly diagnosed down from 169 in 2015 to 141 in 2016 .
Wolverhampton is also seeing falling numbers of people being diagnosed with HIV , down from 47 in 2015 to 32 in 2016 .
The rate of diagnoses in the area is also 1.5 times the England rate at 15.5 per 100,000 people , down from 22.9 per 100,000 in 2015 .
Overall , 1,968 people in Birmingham were receiving HIV care in 2016 , with a total of 4,386 people receiving care across the West Midlands met area as a whole .
In 2016 , 5,164 people were newly diagnosed with HIV in the UK , 3,938 men and 1,226 women , representing an 18 % decline from the 6,286 diagnoses reported in 2015 . This is one of the biggest year on year drops in diagnosis since figures began being recorded in the late-1980s .
The decrease was most apparent in gay and bisexual men . In this group , the number of HIV diagnoses reported steadily increased from 2,850 in 2007 to 3,570 in 2015 , and then decreased by 21 % to 2,810 in 2016 .
According to Public Health England , the UK is one of the first countries in Europe to witness a substantive decline in HIV diagnoses in gay and bisexual men .
The decline is driven by large increases in HIV tests among gay and bisexual men attending sexual health clinics ( from 37,224 in 2007 to 143,560 in 2016 ) including repeat testing in higher risk men , as well as improvements in the uptake of anti-retroviral therapy ( ART ) following HIV diagnosis .
Other factors , including sustained high condom use with casual partners and internet access of preexposure prophylaxis ( PrEP ) , will also have contributed to the downturn in HIV diagnoses in this group .
The decline in HIV diagnoses in gay and bisexual men is particularly focused in parts of London , where diagnoses decreased by 29 % from 1,554 in 2015 to 1,096 in 2016 . The largest declines were observed in areas of London with the highest testing rates and prompt access to treatment .

Between 2007 and 2016 , the median CD4 count , which looks at levels of a type of white blood cell that the HIV virus kills , at diagnosis among gay and bisexual men rose from 396 cells/mm3 to 501 cells/mm3 in London which is further supporting evidence that this decline is due to reduced transmission , as a higher average counts tends to mean earlier diagnoses .
Elsewhere in England HIV diagnoses in gay and bisexual men decreased by 11 % ; from 1,281 in 2015 to 1,140 in 2016 .
The number and proportion of diagnoses made at a late stage of HIV infection ( CD4 count < 350 cells/mm3 at diagnosis ) remains high , particularly among heterosexual men and women .
Overall , 2,110 men and women who probably acquired HIV through heterosexual contact were diagnosed in 2016 ; this decline ( from 4,060 in 2007 ) was largely due to changes in migration patterns .
In 2016 , 60 % ( 413/684 ) of heterosexual men and 47 % ( 354/748 ) of heterosexual women were diagnosed at a late stage , compared with 32 % ( 663/2,096 ) of gay and bisexual men .
Late diagnosis is associated with a higher risk of short term mortality and increased risk of onward transmission since those diagnosed late have been unaware of their HIV infection for around three to five years .

( WSVN ) - You know how every time Marvel puts out a new movie , it 's always touted as the biggest and the best superhero movie yet ? Well , we 're getting our first look at “ Avengers : Infinity Wars , ” -and they might be on to something here .
It 's our first glimpse of “ Avengers : Infinity Wars , ” 14 months before it hits theaters . Cameras are taking us behind the scenes on the new Marvel movie .
Chris Pratt : “ This is our first day , here we are in Pinewood in Atlanta , and it 's actually pretty unbelievable . ”
Robert Downey Jr. : “ Day 1 of what promises to be a fun-filled year of lensing . ”
No , your eyes are n't deceiving you . Chris Pratt 's Star-Lord from the Guardians of the Galaxy is joining the Avengers for this movie — and so is Spider-Man , played by Tom Holland , who we first saw in “ Captain America : Civil War . ”
Tom Holland : “ I remember actually going to see the first Avengers with one of my best mates from home , and I never imagined I 'd be in one of these movies , let alone playing Spider-Man . ”
This Avengers movie promises to be the biggest one yet !
Anthony Russo : “ ‘ Avengers : Infinity War ' is the culmination of the entire Marvel Cinematic Universe as it started in May of 2008 with the first ‘ Iron Man . ' ”
Joe Russo : “ Because of what they have done over the last 10 years , these next two ‘ Avengers ' films will be an event like no one has ever seen on film before . ”
Robert Downey Jr. took a break from filming to answer some Facebook Live questions — getting some important stuff out of the way .
Interviewer : “ And are you and Captain America still not getting along ? ”
Robert Downey Jr. : “ This is correct . He is on my s-list . ”
And while he said a lot , he really did n't say much at all .
Robert Downey Jr. : “ I ca n't give too much away , but this literally feels like the second greatest story ever told , and there are so many characters , so much interesting story , so many surprises . ”
Although we have to give him credit for trying to get co-directors the Russo Brothers to spill some set secrets , they were n't biting .
Robert Downey Jr. : “ What are on these script pages ? ”
Anthony Russo : “ You mean these pages right here ? ”
Robert Downey Jr. : “ Yeah , let me divulge a little nugget . ”

A man has been banned from every John Lewis store in the country after buying and returning 12 TV sets .
Paul Chambers has received a letter from the Operations manager at John Lewis instructing him not to purchase any item from any John Lewis department store , John Lewis.com and Waitrose .
Mr Chambers , from Shirley , who suffers from severe epilepsy , says he has bought and returned 12 TVs from John Lewis in Solihull over a three year period .
But the 54-year-old says he has had to return them all claiming they were faulty with issues including problems with `` ghosting , '' calibrating '' and `` pixelating . ''
The nationwide ban follows a long-running dispute which had already seen Mr Chambers banned from buying any electrical item from the Electrical Home Technology department . In a letter he received last Thursday , the store 's patience appears to have finally worn thin .
Mr Chambers said he was shocked to open the letter from John Lewis on Thursday banning him from purchasing anything from the company in the future .
Mr Chambers added : `` I have experienced lots of problems with the TVs . I have always bought Samsung and Panasonic makes from John Lewis .
`` There have been problems with ghosting , calibrating and pixelating . I do suffer from epilepsy and I need the TV to be visually perfect .
`` Every time I have taken them back the staff have been very friendly so i was shocked to receive this letter . ''
The letter said : `` In light of your recent enquiries we now feel it necessary , and prudent , to terminate our business relationship with you . This decision applies to all John Lewis Department stores , JohnLewis.com and Waitrose . This will take immediate effect . Please advice we shall not process any orders you attempt to place by telephone or online channels .
`` We have taken this decision to our firm belief that that we are unable to meet your service needs , nor do we believe our range of products will meet your expexctations .
`` We would therefore ask you not to visit the Solihull store or any other John Lewis branch . if you do we shall ask you to leave immediately , we would not wish to embarrass you in this way so we would kindly ask you to comply with this request . ''
Mr Chambers said : `` I could n't believe it when I opened the letter . They have banned me from every John Lewis in the country and I ca n't buy anything off them online . The TVs were faulty so I returned them . I had all sorts of problems with them so I simply returned them . I was paying up to £900 for the TVs so they had to be right .
`` My friend has let me borrow his old TV now and it has been fine . But I would have liked to have gone back to John Lewis to buy another TV in the future . ''
BirminghamLive has contacted John Lewis for a statement .

The move comes just days after a Staffordshire man was banned from Asda stores in a row over the price of fabric conditioner .
Mulkh Chumber bought ten bottles of Comfort Creations at his local branch in Wolstanton after an advert revealed the item was slashed in price , StokeonTrentLive reported .
The shopper expected to pick them up for £10 , rather than £30 .
But Mr Chumber , a newsagent , was left gobsmacked when staff told him the ad was wrong .
He was informed the products had only been reduced to £2 .
Rather than fork out £20 , Mr Chumber refused to leave the store - and Asda called in the police .
He added : “ Asda security staff handed me a letter saying I am banned from every single Asda in the UK and I was shocked .
`` It is not fair .
`` If something is advertised at a certain price then you should give it to the customer at that price .
`` I used to go to Asda three or four times a week and have never had any problems before .
`` I can do without them and go to Morrisons instead . ”
Asda has confirmed Mulkh 's ban remains in place . It comes just weeks after shopper Andrew Gregory was banned from Asda 's Tunstall store following a row over the toilets .
On Mulkh 's ban , an Asda spokesman said : “ We would have honoured the advertised deal but do not tolerate abusive behaviour towards colleagues . ”

Shares in Danske Bank fell 3 per cent after reports that it may have laundered up to $ 8.3 billion ( €7.1 billion ) through its Estonian operations , more than double previous estimates , increasing the pressure on Denmark 's biggest bank .
Danish newspaper Berlingske reported that as much as 53 billion Danish krone ( €7.1 billion ) of suspicious money had flowed through the Estonian branch of Danske .
Rasmus Jarlov , Denmark 's business minister , said the “ gravely serious ” case was getting worse . “ It casts a shadow of mistrust over our entire banking system , and nobody gains from that , ” he wrote on Twitter on Wednesday .
The business minister has said that the bank 's internal investigation – due to report in the autumn – might not be sufficient . Opposition politicans in Copenhagen have called on Denmark 's fraud squad to investigate .
Reprimanded
Danske was reprimanded and severely criticised by Danish regulators in May for weak anti-money laundering controls that led to suspected “ criminal activities involving vast amounts of money ” . The Danish Financial Supervisory Authority ordered Danske to set aside 5 billion Danish krone in capital to cover compliance matters but found insufficient evidence to make a case against any individuals .
“ The headlines are clearly negative for investor sentiment for Danske , with the [ anti-money laundering ] issue dragging on stock performance over the past year , ” said Adam Barrass , analyst at Berenberg , who noted that Danske had underperformed the European banking index by 10 per cent in the past year .
He added that the key risk was a potential US fine because of Danske 's use of dollar funding and transactions . But he added that such a fine was unlikely given that Danske has no US banking licence , dollar clearing facility or access to the Federal Reserve liquidity window .
Problems for CEO
The scandal raises significant questions about what senior management knew , when , and why they failed to act sooner . Danske launched its own investigation last year into the allegations that its Estonian branch was used from 2007 until 2015 for money laundering from countries including Russia , Azerbaijan and Moldova .
The investigation could pose questions for Thomas Borgen , Danske 's chief executive since 2013 , who was in charge of international banking including the Baltics for four years before that .
Anders Jorgensen , head of group compliance at Danske , said it was too early to draw conclusions about the extent of the potential money laundering , meaning that it could not comment on specific figures before its own probe is finished in September .
“ On several occasions , however , we have said that the extent seems to be somewhat larger than previously estimated ... But there is no doubt that even one krone laundered is one too many , and that we take this matter very seriously . ”
Berlingske said the new transactions it uncovered were linked to the fraud from the Russian treasury discovered by Sergei Magnitsky , a lawyer who was later beaten to death in jail . A French court last year placed Danske under investigation over the Magnitsky case but later dropped the matter . – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2018
This week 's non-fiction book of the week is The Captain Class : The Hidden Force That Creates the World 's Greatest Teams , by Sam Walker . Click for lessons # 1 and # 2 .
Lesson # 3 : What makes a great captain ?
Walker sets out a series of attributes : They lack superstar talent – but more than make up for it . They are n't fond of the spotlight – but are n't afraid of it . They do n't “ lead ” in the traditional sense – it 's not Hollywood charisma . They are not angels – many of their most famous moments do n't make inspirational posters . They do potentially divisive things – they speak truth to power and to teammates ( “ It 's a totally romantic idea that you have to be 11 friends , ” says Bayern Munich captain Philipp Lahm in the book ) . They are n't the usual suspects – a generational talent usually does n't become a generational leader . Finally , the captain is n't the primary leader – there are still coaches and management above .
Tomorrow 's lesson : What do captains do ?
Johnny Sexton 's late , late drop goal saw Ireland open their NatWest Six Nations campaign with a barely believable 15-13 win against France at the Stade de France .
Ireland 's dreadful record in Paris looked set to continue as they trailed 13-12 past the 80 minute mark .
As firm as 5/2 on favourites before kick-off , Joe Schmidt 's side led for most of the clash without ever dominating a French team that had not won in seven previous games .
It was coach Jacques Brunel 's first game in charge and he drew an inexperienced team together that stuck with Ireland , who were ahead thanks to four Sexton penalties , until winger Teddy Thomas scorched home from 50 yards to put the French ahead for the first time in the game with seven minutes to play
Anthony Belleau missed a chance to extend the lead and Ireland had to make their way into France territory with time running out to land the winning score .
It took 41 phases before Sexton decided that he was in range , the out-half 's arms going up in celebration before the ball dropped inches over the bar and Ireland escaped with just their third win in the city since the early 70s .
Ireland 's start was textbook .
Until Murray 's overcooked Garryowen in the eighth minute , every play went according to plan and it yielded a penalty for Sexton after France went offside in the centre .
Ireland , whose starting team contained 609 caps compared to France 's 246 , had spoken about pressuring the French scrum in advance of kick-off but were lucky not to be penalised after the first contest on 10 minutes when Cian Healy slipped .
Les Bleus however were still not as sharp as Ireland and lost possession through some basic errors , an infection that soon spread to the visitors .
Matthieu Jalibert , the 19-year-old out-half debutant , almost set Virimi Vakatawa away but the pair ran out of space on the left flank , however , France were gaining a foothold in the tie through Irish errors .
Ireland were struggling in the tight spaces in midfield but when Keith Earls got the ball out wide and ran at the French defence it again ended with another Sexton penalty in the 23rd minute .
They could n't build on the momentum and were guilty of trying too hard ; Rob Kearney had to be alert when a kick-through threatened to get France on the scoreboard .
The error count was increasing and just when it looked like some room would open up for the busy Earls or James Ryan the support play was too slow .
France lost Jalibert to a knee injury after half an hour and on came another rookie , the twice capped Belleau .
True , Ireland had a slight advantage in the possession and territory stakes but still their collective play looked nervy and when CJ Stander and Kearney were stripped of the ball it led to Maxime Machenaud halving the deficit with a penalty five minutes before the break .
Dan Leavy replaced stricken Josh van der Flier , the flanker going off for what appeared to be a knee injury , but Ireland hit back four minutes later with a crucial score .
The attack was lateral and making slow progress up the pitch ; France seemed comfortable in defence but Sebastien Vahaamahina decided to charge into Murray at a slow ruck and Sexton pushed out the lead to six again with the resulting penalty .
The half-time stats showed that Schmidt 's men had enjoyed 70 % possession and 72 % territory so the 9-3 lead was the least they should have expected but the coach would have been glad of the break to discuss the sloppiness of their play .
The second half started in the same vein and Ireland kept the scoreboard ticking over another Sexton penalty .
The vistors pushed for another score and were within 10 metres of the line when Tadhg Furlong was stripped by Jefferson Poirot , the turnover eventually leading to Machenaud slotting France 's second penalty .
France , buoyed by the strains of La Marseillaise , tried to push back as the rain continued to fall steadily in Saint Denis .
Sexton missed a kickable penalty , Henshaw threw a forward pass in midfield and France made a 50-yard break when wing Virimi Vakatawa cut inside .
The Leinster and Lions out-half then forced a brilliant turnover , which earned him his team-mates ' plaudits but Ireland were playing like a computer with a glitch somewhere in the system .
Then came the score that looked to have stolen the game from Ireland .
Kearney cleared to touch near the halfway mark , but a quick lineout throw was shovelled on to Thomas who cut inside and arrowed towards the posts with the full-back and Earls failing to lay a significant hand on the Racing 92 winger .
Belleau duly converted to give France the lead in the 72nd minute .
Belleau 's missed kick then gave Ireland one last chance to wrestle back the lead .
Henderson caught the restart , almost every green player then helped Ireland inch up field , Sexton even risked a cross-kick for Earls who did brilliantly to keep the play alive .
France thought they had repelled the attack but Sexton kept his cool and landed the monster kick before being smothered by his team-mates as Les Bleus sat stunned in Stade de France .
The alleged stalker of Michael Jackson 's daughter , Paris Jackson received a temporary restraining order .
According to TMZ , she sought a court-ordered protection from the man , Nicholas Lewis Stevens , who was stalking her .
In the restraining order , the stalker has been asked to stay at least 91.44 metres away from her and to not try to contact her until next court hearing , which is scheduled to take place later this month .
According to the court documents , Paris said Stevens showed up at the recording studio where she happened to be working .
Paris also mentioned that after interacting with the said stalker , she got to know that he had stopped by the studio on many occasions , and even waited 15 hours for her .
The documents further revealed that Paris ' friend confronted Stevens . On being asked about his purpose of visiting the studio , he replied , “ What the f * * * does it look like I 'm doing here ? I 'm stalking your bitch . ”
The cops eventually detained Lewis .
The documents even mentioned that Lewis tweeted a photo of Paris and called her his soulmate .
( CNN ) — The White House insisted on Wednesday it was not defending Roseanne Barr for the racist tweet that ultimately led to her sitcom 's cancellation on ABC .
But President Donald Trump and his press secretary Sarah Sanders insisted they were also owed an apology from ABC for airing derogatory comments about the administration .
It was an expansive answer on a topic Sanders had said just a day before was not on Trump 's radar . It reflected the President 's deeply felt resentment at his portrayal in the media , and his long list of grievances at perceived slights over the past year .
“ The President is pointing to the hypocrisy in the media saying the most horrible things about this President and nobody addresses it , ” Sanders told reporters at Wednesday 's press briefing .
She was speaking after Trump wrote on Twitter that Bob Iger , the president of ABC 's parent company , Disney , had failed to express regret for the negative things people have said on air about him .
Bob Iger of ABC called Valerie Jarrett to let her know that “ ABC does not tolerate comments like those ” made by Roseanne Barr . Gee , he never called President Donald J. Trump to apologize for the HORRIBLE statements made and said about me on ABC . Maybe I just did n't get the call ? — Donald J. Trump ( @ realDonaldTrump ) May 30 , 2018
“ Gee , he never called President Donald J. Trump to apologize for the HORRIBLE statements made and said about me on ABC , ” Trump wrote , referring to himself in the third person . “ Maybe I just did n't get the call ? ”
Sanders expanded on that sentiment , reading from a list of examples meant to bolster Trump 's point , including ESPN host Jemele Hill calling Trump a white supremacist on Twitter , “ The View ” host Joy Behar likening Christianity to mental illness and ESPN anchor Keith Olbermann attacking Trump as a Nazi .
“ This is a double standard that the President is speaking about , ” Sanders said . “ No one is defending her comments . They were inappropriate . But that was the point that he was making . ”
She lamented the fact television networks did n't air Trump 's remarks earlier in the day focused on a new “ right to try ” bill aimed at helping terminally ill patients access drug treatments that are yet to be fully approved by the Food and Drug Administration .
And , as on Tuesday , she insisted the President was focused on other matters , even as her answer on Barr stretched longer than her responses on North Korea or Puerto Rico .
“ The President is simply calling out media bias , ” Sanders said . “ No one is defending what she said . The President is the President of all Americans and he 's focused on doing what is best for our country . ”

The Catalan Government will keep its commitment to call a referendum later this year “ because the citizens themselves are demanding the right to express their opinion by answering a clear and simple question , ” Puigdemont and Junqueras sustain . The article , titled ‘ Why ca n't Madrid be like London ? ” , explains the Spanish Government 's “ worrying lack of willingness to open a dialogue ” on the Catalan situation .
Both leaders believe that “ the attitude of the Catalan Government and that of the Catalan Parliament ” are “ undeniably ” similar to that of Scotland , since they are both willing “ to open a dialogue and reach agreements on the referendum ” . However , Spain 's position is “ fundamentally different ” from the UK 's .
Puigdemont and Junqueras also lament “ the judicialization of politics , the dirty war and the state of emergency 's threats ” and criticize the Spanish Government for “ hiding behind ” the courts and “ compromising the judiciary 's work and independence ” .
As evidence , they refer to former Catalan President , Artur Mas ' ban from public office for having allowed a non-official vote on independence in 2014 and warn that the usage of the court to respond to political matters “ is worrying to ” Europe .
The article also emphasized the creation of the National Alliance for the Referendum which gathers together “ a plural majority of the Catalan society , including economic and social actors ” and emphasizes that “ 80 % of Catalans want to be asked about Catalonia 's political future ” .
They both insist on the high turnout for the eventual referendum forecasted by many polls and emphasize their willingness to accept the outcome . “ We are democrats , first and foremost , ” they state .
“ Politics have been on the agenda for a long time now , ” they say , pointing to the need to “ listen and talk ” . “ We are already at the negotiating table . We are open to discuss everything , without exception . We are willing to follow the UK 's and Scotland 's path , the path of agreement . How long is it going to take for the other guests to arrive ? ” , they conclude .

The AFC Championship Game was almost two weeks ago , and the New England Patriots suffered a small handful of injuries during that contest that seemed quite concerning . With that much time between the conclusion of that game and Super Bowl LII , the hope was that most of the injuries would heal up and that the majority of the roster would be in playing shape to face the Philadelphia Eagles .
Little did anyone expect for the New England Patriots to have a Super Bowl injury report without a single player listed .
That 's right . For the first time all season , the Pats have not a single person listed on their injury report as late on Friday afternoon ; they 've removed every single player . Earlier in the week , there were a handful of names on it and some who were dealing with some rather serious issues , but everything seems to have been cleared up .
Earlier in the week , the Patriots had four players listed on the injury report and all of them have healed up in the exact same timeframe . They were limited in practice on Wednesday , practiced in full for the first time on Thursday , and were completely removed from the list as of Friday .
The biggest name was obviously that of tight end Rob Gronkowski , who suffered a concussion after taking a very hard hit to the helmet against the Jacksonville Jaguars . On Tuesday , Gronk said that he was feeling much better and he expected to be cleared and removed from the NFL 's concussion protocol at any moment , but Wednesday came and went without change .
This brought about a bit of concern as the Super Bowl was drawing ever closer and the Patriots knew that playing without Gronk was becoming a bigger possibility . On Thursday , though , the star tight end was cleared and participated fully in Thursday 's practice .
One of the other big worries of New England coaches was cornerback Malcolm Butler , who was battling an illness that came with flu-like symptoms . It was actually quite serious and he did not fly out to Minnesota with his teammates on Monday , as he did n't want to get any of them sick . He stayed behind in Massachusetts and went to the hospital a number of times , but he was never admitted overnight . By Wednesday , Butler was practicing in a limited capacity and ready to go full-speed on Thursday .
Defensive back Brandon King ( knee ) and defensive lineman Deatrich Wise ( concussion ) were the other two players on the injury report at the beginning of the week , but they also improved enough to practice fully on Thursday . On Friday , they were practicing at full-speed once again and removed from the injury report .
It is quite unheard of for an NFL team to have an empty injury report at any point in a season , and that includes Week 1 . Still , here are the New England Patriots with a clean slate and a totally healthy team as they prepare to face the Philadelphia Eagles in Super Bowl LII on Sunday .

CHANCELLOR URGED TO CREATE FAIR TAX SYSTEM FOR HIGH STREET AND ONLINE BUSINESSES
Business leaders are calling on Chancellor Philip Hammond to tackle anomalies in the tax system that see high street shops pay higher rates on small premises than online giants do for vast warehouses .

With many small shops and pubs bracing themselves for sharp rises in their tax bills due to business rate revaluations this year , the IoD called for further relief for businesses based in properties worth up to £100,000 .
HEADING THE BALL REPEATEDLY 'CAN RESULT IN DEVELOPMENT OF DEMENTIA '
Footballers who repeatedly head the ball can end up suffering from dementia , new findings have suggested , prompting calls for more research into a long-suspected issue in the sport .
A potential cause of dementia thought to arise from blows to the head has , for the first time , been confirmed in a group of retired footballers following a small study .
The results provide a platform for a `` pressing research question '' on whether dementia is more common in footballers than the general population , the authors said .

CHURCH OF ENGLAND TO DEBATE NEW STANCE ON GAYS AMID PROTEST
Leading figures in the Church of England are to debate homosexuality and same-sex marriage amid criticism that it is failing to give gay people a voice .
A report by the House of Bishops , which will be presented to the General Synod , calls for the Church to adopt a `` fresh tone and culture of welcome and support '' for gay people but not to change its opposition to same-sex marriage .
It also suggests gay and straight men and women training to join the priesthood should face the same questions about their lifestyle - a move which has been likened to a `` Do n't Ask , Do n't Tell '' policy .

There are concerns that following disruptions of the oil flows on the pipeline feeding the Trans-Forcados terminal in Nigeria , the facility faces more than two weeks of delays of oil cargo loadings , as no official June or July loading schedules have been released yet , oil industry sources said yesterday .
The flow of crude oil to the Forcados terminal is said to have resumed last week , but loading delays have continued to accumulate , also delaying the release of June and July loading programs , according to the sources . A tentative re-schedule plan for June has been prepared , but it is unlikely that the rescheduled loading dates will be kept , and delays could even be longer than expected , trading sources .
About two weeks ago , the Trans-Forcados pipeline that ships between 200,000 barrels per day , bpd and 240,000 bpd of oil to the Forcados terminal was shut down for repairs of a minor leak , a source with knowledge of the matter said . Back then , trading sources said that loadings were delayed by at least one week .
Two days later , the Nigerian subsidiary of Shell declared force majeure on Bonny Light exports because of the shutdown of the Nembe Creek pipeline , which had led to the accumulation of lots of unsold crude .
The Nembe Creek transports 150,000 bpd of Bonny Light to the Forcados terminal that Shell operates . After a shut-down of nearly a week , the Trans-Forcados pipeline resumed operations last Wednesday , and started ramping up the crude flow to the Forcados terminal .
The operator of the Forcados oil terminal , Shell , stated last week that crude oil exports had not been affected by the shutdown . But industry sources said that the temporary closure had already affected crude cargo loading plans and the June cargoes of Forcados had been deferred to July . “ Forcados is taking a bit of a battering reputationally , ” one trader stated .
“ Bigger buyers will always find a home for cargoes even with some uncertainty over cargo loading dates . But value can be affected as more marginal buyers look elsewhere to minimize their risk , ” the trader added .

In a motion to dismiss filed Monday , attorneys for Eddie Martins and Richard Hall claim Anna Chambers gave one story to NYPD 's Internal Affairs Bureau and a different one to the grand jury that indicted the cops .
The filing accuses the prosecution of “ sanitizing the truth ” and claims that Chambers ' friend and witness Mitch Asham told police she had previously lied about being raped . Reached Monday , Amshen denied telling that to cops .
According to the motion , Chambers told IAB that she was too high at the time of the alleged rape to remember details .
Her lawyer , Michael David , said hospital records prove she was alert and oriented when she went for a rape kit the evening of the alleged attack .
“ First they brutally raped her , now they 're trying to destroy her life , ” he said .
A DA spokesman called defense lawyers “ attacks ” on Chambers “ inappropriate . ”
MIAMI SPRINGS , FLA. ( WSVN ) - The Animal Rescue Corps brought almost 200 dogs and cats from the U.S. Virgin Island of St. Martin to Miami International Airport after they were left homeless by Hurricanes Irma and Maria .
Both storms devastated islands in the Caribbean , and homeless animals were among its victims .
“ Tonight is the beginning of new lives for these dogs that we 've been working so hard to get off the island of St. Martin , ” said Scotlund Hailsey , the rescue group 's founder . “ These animals , most of them were already in shelters or in foster care there , but they have no opportunity for placement there now . ”
The animals stretched their legs at the Miami Springs Dog Park as they got ready for their 15-hour road trip to Tennessee .
They 'll be taken to a shelter near Nashville to be medically evaluated and treated if necessary .
“ It was important to get them here to the U.S. , so we can soon give them the opportunity to be loved members of a family , ” said Hailsey .
This is the ARC 's third hurricane relief effort in recent weeks .
From Puerto Rico , the Humane Society of Broward County and Wings of Rescue touched down Friday night at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport with nearly 100 animals .
“ We brought two and a half tons of humanitarian supplies in , and coming out , we 're bringing the pets that have been displaced by the storm , ” said Wings of Rescue 's Ric Browde
Thirty-two cats and 62 dogs were loaded off the plane .
The animals were put onto trucks to be taken to their shelter .
For now , they 'll recover from the long three-and-a-half hour trip from San Juan .
“ We 're going to let them rest , and then tomorrow our clinic staff will hopefully be able to start checking some of them , ” said Humane Society of Broward spokesperson Cherie Wachter .
Wachter hopes the animals will be put up for adoption soon .
Wachter said it 's a much-needed lifeline for animals now looking for a new “ forever home. ” “ This is really life and death for these animals , ” she said .

Council workers residing at Trafalgar Court in Harare 's central business district ( CBD ) have voiced concern over the proliferation of commercial sex workers at the City of Harare flat fearing that it would be turned into a brothel owing to massive illegal occupations and subletting .
The building is originally earmarked to accommodate municipal police offices , City Parking offices as well as offering cheap accommodation to council employees .
However , the situation has changed over the years as the building now also houses private businesses and tenants who are not employed by council .
Residents who spoke to The Herald said commercial sex workers found their way into the council building and were bringing danger to residents as many “ clients ” were now frequenting the flat .
“ These hookers are disturbing our way of life . Imagine , we stay here as families . What will our children learn from their immoral behaviour ? There are some council officials who were allocated these flats but do no stay here , they are the ones subletting the flats , ” said a resident who declined to be identified .
Another council worker who also stays at Trafalgar Court concurred with his colleague saying council hierarchy should carry out an audit to flush out people leasing flats .
“ The only way to cure this is for council to carry out an audit or a head count to find out if council workers are occupying these flats because the situation is getting out of hand , remember the building also hosts some respectable offices . ”
The city 's corporate communications manager Mr Michael Chideme yesterday said council would investigate the issue and cancel leases for those found subletting the apartments .
“ Subletting is not allowed . Trafalgar has institutional residential apartments . Families and singles stay at Trafalgar . Insinuating that it is being turned into a brothel is wrong and scandalous . Council does not control visitations to individual apartments , ” he said .
Mr Chideme however , said the city would cancel leases of employees who were found to be subletting the apartments .
An audit by City of Harare in March last year unearthed massive illegal occupations , subletting , and non-payment of rent at the council owned Trafalgar Court .
The Audit Committee sat in March last year to discuss the outcome of the probe after finding out that there were high levels of illegal occupation and non-payment of rent at the council building .
In addition , some unscrupulous council employees are sub-letting their allocated apartments .
The audit also established a 24 percent illegal occupancy rate and high levels of rental arrears . Herald

David Bradley is set to reprise his role as the Time Lord in Doctor Who .
Peter Capaldi is set to have a new time travelling companion in the Christmas Special – in the shape of his first incarnation - it has been revealed .
Harry Potter star David will reprise his role as the First Doctor , originally played by William Hartnell .
Bradley previously portrayed the actor behind the first timelord for the BBC sci-fi show 's 50th drama An Adventure In Space and Time .
He will flank Capaldi 's 12th Doctor in this year 's festive outing , following the departure of Pearl Mackie as Bill Potts at the end of this series ( despite rave reviews after her debut on Saturday ) .

In the plot , the First Doctor has to help the 12th play out his last mission in the TARDIS .
The pair must work together to save home planet Gallifrey by moving it to another dimension .

Bradley , 73 , is best known for his role as Argus Filch in the Potter films and as the suicidal newsagent in the first series of Broadchurch .
He first played Hartnell 's Doctor in drama-documentary An Adventure in Time and Space .
An insider revealed : “ David was convincing as Hartnell , it 's exciting he 's back .
“ Four years ago it took all the previous Doctors to save Gallifrey , so maybe some of the others will also pop up in Capaldi 's swansong .
“ It 's great that the 1st Doctor will be there to help out during those all-important regeneration moments . ”
Hartnell , who died in 1975 , played the 1st Doctor from 1963 to 1966 .

Britain 's Got Talent and Doctor Who both held steady in the ratings as they debuted with near-identical viewing figures to those of their previous season-openers .
The 10th series of Doctor Who returned with a first episode titled The Pilot which attracted overnight ratings of 4.6 million , the BBC said .
This figure is identical to the previous series-opener from 2015 .
The viewing figures for the first episode may get another boost when the figures for audiences who watch the show on catch-up are added .
The 2015 figure of 4.6 million rose to 6.5 million when the people who recorded the episode and watched it up to seven days later were included .
The show has been off air since December 2015 , with the exception of a Christmas special , and has traditionally been aired in the autumn .
The BBC denied reports that Death In Paradise star Kris Marshall had been cast as Capaldi 's replacement .

ATLANTA ( CBSMiami/AP ) — Something that raised eyebrows this week was the National Rifle Association urging the government to revisit “ bump stocks ” and whether they should be restricted .
Why would the nation 's leading gun-rights organization , not known for compromise , be willing to bend even just a bit when it wields perhaps more influence than ever ?
Some gun-industry experts say the NRA 's move is little more than a ruse to stall any momentum for wider gun control until outrage over the Las Vegas attack subsides . It also carries little risk . For one , it 's rare for the Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , Firearms and Explosives to reverse course without a change in the law . For another , “ bump stocks ” are not big moneymakers for the gun industry . And by seeking an administrative change , rather than a new law , the NRA allows its supporters in Congress to avoid going on the record with a vote .
“ They 're dismissed as silly gadgets that really inhibit the accuracy of a firearm . If these bump stocks were super popular among gun owners , we 'd see a very different position from the NRA , ” said Adam Winkler , a professor at the University of California , Los Angeles , School of Law and author of “ Gunfight : The Battle over the Right to Bear Arms in America . ”
The NRA “ can throw a sacrificial lamb of ‘ bump stocks ' because they know that gun owners do n't use them or like them , ” he added .
The devices , originally intended to help people with disabilities , fit over the stock and pistol grip of a semi-automatic rifle and allow the weapon to fire continuously , some 400 to 800 rounds in a single minute , mimicking a fully automatic firearm . Bump stocks were found among the weapons used by Stephen Paddock as he rained bullets from a Las Vegas casino high-rise last Sunday . The gunfire killed 58 people at a concert below and wounded hundreds more .
On Thursday , the NRA issued a statement that urged the ATF to review whether the devices comply with federal law and said it “ believes that devices designed to allow semi-automatic rifles to function like fully automatic rifles should be subject to additional regulations . ”
The statement pointedly noted that it was under President Barack Obama 's administration that the devices were authorized to be sold and again urged Congress to enact one of the gun lobby 's top priorities : a national “ concealed-carry reciprocity ” law that would require all states to recognize other states ' concealed carry permits .
In a matter of hours , NRA chief lobbyist Chris Cox put to rest any sense that the group was actively seeking a ban of bump stocks , telling Fox News ' Tucker Carlson : “ What we 've said is ATF needs to do their job . ATF needs to look and if there 's technology that 's come to the market that allow for a semi-automatic rifle to function as a fully automatic rifle , they need to be regulated differently . We did n't talk about banning anything . ”
Notably , the nation 's other leading gun lobbying groups , including Gun Owners of America , reiterated their opposition to restricting or banning the devices .
The few companies that sell bump stocks are known to include in their packaging a letter from the ATF from 2010 , when the agency concluded that they were not restricted by either the Gun Control Act or the National Firearms Act .
The ATF provides guidance when a manufacturer asks the agency to evaluate a firearm or accessory to determine if its sale is restricted by either federal law . It is extremely rare for the ATF to reconsider its previous guidance unless federal law changes — so rare that experts could think of only one time when it has happened , and even then they were n't sure their memories were correct .
The agency , describing its process in general on Friday , indicated that Congress will be responsible for decisions about regulating or banning the devices .
It was not immediately clear whether President Donald Trump or Attorney General Jeff Sessions , who oversees the ATF , could order it to re-evaluate its judgment about devices .
The NRA is viewed as the most powerful and most inflexible group in the gun lobby . It pours millions of dollars into political campaigns and successfully blocks legislation that would either ban certain firearms or make them more difficult to purchase . The NRA has only gained influence following the election of Trump , who became the first president since Ronald Reagan to address the group 's annual meeting .
After some particularly deadly mass shootings , the NRA has worked to find some common ground with gun-control advocates .
Following the 2007 Virginia Tech shooting in which a mentally ill student shot and killed 32 people and wounded 17 , the NRA worked with gun-control advocates to fund a bill designed to improve record keeping so that people with mental illnesses were unable to purchase a firearm .
In the days following the Las Vegas attack , unusual alliances began to emerge between top Democratic and Republican members of Congress urging that bump stocks be banned . If the devices were restricted by an administrative ruling , it would spare NRA supporters in Congress from having to go on the record with a vote .
John Feinblatt , president of Everytown for Gun Safety , cast the NRA 's move as a “ wink and a nod . ”
“ They 're not making a concession . What they 've really done is punted this to the very federal agency that said bump stocks were legal , ” Feinblatt said . “ This was just a wink and nod . ”

The state-of-the-art , sustainable building was built in just 11 weeks and is designed to foster the school 's unique co-teaching model
Thanks to the generosity of an anonymous donor , Crane Country Day School in Montecito has opened the doors on a new kindergarten facility that has raised the bar for the future of education .
Built in just 11 weeks , the new kindergarten is equipped with state-of-the-art technology and stays true to Crane 's commitment to sustainability .
Situated on a grassy knoll and fitted with a wraparound porch and vegetable garden , Crane 's kindergarten aesthetics pay homage to the old-fashioned schoolhouses of the early 20th century . The design aims to provide children with a homey atmosphere in which to feel more comfortable during their transition into the educational system .
“ Kindergarten is one of the bookends . We start at kindergarten as the entry point of our schools , ” said Joel Weiss , headmaster of Crane Country Day School . “ We have a unique thing at the kindergarten age by having 20 kids with two full-time teachers . The two-teacher model is a luxury because there are a lot of different ways to teach , and this was a part of the project . Before they were teaching in a small cottage . ”
With two classrooms connected by a foyer , the idea of utilizing a secondary teaching space in the new kindergarten facility was conceived through the kindergarten 's unique co-teaching model . With two instructors teaming up to work with about 20 children , the model allows for more individual and one-on-one instruction .
“ I think the whole idea for the project sprang from the co-teaching model , and the space we were in was n't very big , ” said kindergarten co-teacher Megan MacMurray , who is also a graduate of Crane . “ It was one small room , and it was hard for us to do individual instruction . We will have one large area with a carpet and desks , and then a separate pull-out room , and we can have can separate instruction . ”
Perhaps the most innovative and flashy addition to the classroom is a smart board . Picture one big iPad mounted on the wall . The smart board is a multifunctional , interactive whiteboard that uses touch detection .
“ The smart board is so interactive and the children are at a good age to use it , ” MacMurray said . “ They are so savvy as young as they are . ”
While the kindergarten at Crane is pioneering modern education , the construction project for the building was also an impressive anomaly . Think of it as Extreme Makeover : Kindergarten Edition . Crane demolished and rebuilt the kindergarten facility in just 11 weeks , the length of the school 's summer recess .
With Weiss and Dale Dunlap , Crane 's business manager , at the helm , the school defied conventional engineering wisdom .
“ Schools are unique in that they have summer off , and the day after graduation the bulldozers came in and leveled the old building , ” Weiss said . “ It was quite a large project . Basically we were building a house in 11 weeks . It was an aggressive sprint of a project . It 's almost like we dared them to build it in 11 weeks . ”
To complete such a large project in such a small window of time , Weiss and Dunlap worked multilaterally with contractors to initiate a design plan that would synthesize a construction project that traditionally takes up to year to build . Project framers built the walls on another part of campus . Weiss and Dunlop said the kindergarten went from a stone slab to a building in one day .
“ The project was about efficiencies of scale for us , ” Dunlap said . “ And it was fun for the subcontractors to work in a team setting . It was not uncommon to have 25 or 30 guys working on a project concurrently . Usually on big projects you work one at a time , but we had all the subs working concurrently . ”
The building qualifies for LEED certification , the highest recognition for sustainable facilities . With solar panels and open skylights providing natural light inside , Dunlap calls the new kindergarten a very well thought-out building .
“ Every choice along the way was meant to be sustainable , ” she said . “ From using bulletin board material made out of cork instead of plastic to having all the electrical fixtures hitting way below the standard . We tried to make the whole building have air passage and full of light so turning on lights is unnecessary . ”
In addition , the facility 's roof has been designed to collect water runoff . The rain is collected into a bucket and pump system that the kindergartners can use for gardening or in the sandbox .
The new kindergarten and the sustainability of the new building have been well received by the Crane School community , including students , parents and faculty .
“ We are teaching the kids that we can reuse water , ” MacMurray said . “ I think it 's great how we have really optimized the space . ”
Admission tours begin Oct. 10 . To schedule an appointment , call admissions associate Julia Davis at 805.695.0536 x127 . The kindergarten classroom will also be open for tours from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. Sunday , Oct. 30 at the Crane Country Fair .

Gardaí are continuing to question a man in relation to the death of Patricia O'Connor ( 61 ) after the woman 's dismembered remains were found scattered over a Wicklow roadside .
The 32-year-old man presented himself to Rathfarnham Garda station on Monday but was released as investigating gardaí in Bray believed the torso found dumped in a plastic bag on Saturday was male .
However , when the State Pathologist 's Office confirmed the victim was female on Tuesday and Ms O'Connor 's head was found , the suspect then became crucial to the inquiry .
He told the Garda he had dismembered Ms O'Connor , a mother and grandmother , in a field in Co Wexford and had made a crude attempt to bury her there before taking the remains away and scattering them over a 30km stretch of road in Co Wicklow .
The suspect took gardaí to the field in Co Wexford on Tuesday and when clear physical evidence , including blood , hair and signs of digging the earth were found , the man was arrested .
He has been detained since then for questioning in connection with the murder .
The woman was beaten to death with a hurl in her Mountain View Park home in Rathfarnham home almost two weeks ago .
The man being questioned is believed to have also lived there and it is understood there were existing tensions in the family surrounding ownership of the house .
Gardaí believe the suspect and Ms O'Connor were part of a close family-based group that had spent a lot of time together in recent years .
The deceased woman , who was estranged from her husband , left Dublin for the UK for a period and then returned to live in Ireland last year .
Panicked
Detectives are working on the theory that when Ms O'Connor 's attacker killed her he panicked and did not know how to dispose of the body .
Detectives suspect her killing may have been a spur of the moment incident and during the course of an argument .
Gardaí believe her killer then drove his vehicle with Ms O'Connor 's remains inside to Kilmuckridge , Co Wexford , where she was dismembered and partially buried in a field .
The man appears to have left the remains in the field before returning and exhuming the body parts from the earth and throwing them from his vehicle on the drive back to Dublin via Wicklow .
On Saturday people out walking found the large part of a torso and a huge search operation commenced .
It is ongoing and so far remains have been found in 10 locations ; including Ms O'Connor 's hands and head in plastic bags .
Ms O'Connor worked as a chef at Mount Carmel Hospital in Churchtown .
VICTORIA — British Columbia 's Liberal leadership race is expected to expand to eight candidates , with former transportation minister Todd Stone poised to enter the contest .
The Kamloops-South Thompson member of the legislature has scheduled three campaign-style events Tuesday stopping in Surrey , Victoria and finishing the day with an event at Thompson Rivers University in his hometown of Kamloops .
An email from former Liberal cabinet minister Peter Fassbender says B.C . needs a fresh vision to keep the province on track and Stone will make a special announcement about the Liberals party 's future .
Stone released a YouTube video in September saying he was considering whether to run , then added that if he were to be leader , the B.C . Liberal Party would not accept the taxpayer subsidies that are being proposed by the minority New Democrats .
Former Surrey mayor Dianne Watts announced her intentions for the party 's top job last month , along with 38-year-old Terrace businesswoman Lucy Sager and five current provincial Liberal politicians , Sam Sullivan , Mike Bernier , Andrew Wilkinson , Mike de Jong and Michael Lee .
The first of six candidate debates is set for Oct. 15 in Surrey , with party members electing a new leader to replace former premier Christy Clark in early February .

One longtime member of Wynn Resorts ' board of directors has resigned and another has withdrawn his name for re-election two days before shareholders are to vote on the board 's makeup at the company 's annual meeting in Las Vegas .
The company announced Monday director John Hagenbuch wo n't stand for re-election at the May 16 meeting . It said director Robert Miller also has resigned .
Some shareholders have sued Hagenbuch and other directors alleging breach of fiduciary duties stemming from sexual misconduct allegations against founder Steve Wynn , who has denied the accusations .
The largest shareholder , Elaine Wynn , had urged investors to withhold votes for Hagenbuch .
Board chairman D. Boone Wayson said Monday Hagenbuch 's decision to remove himself from the ballot `` to end the distraction of the withhold campaign is a reflection of his loyalty to Wynn Resorts '' and commitment to its success .

An archaeological search for a rifle from the Easter Rising , thought to be lodged in a small gap between buildings at City Hall for the past century , came up empty handed on Wednesday .
Archaeologists excavated a large amount of debris , built up between the narrow gap over the past 100 years at City Hall , in search of a rifle that belonged to Willie Halpin .
Family history claims that , rather than surrender the gun to the advancing British soldiers , Halpin dropped it down the side of City Hall from the roof where he was fighting , before he climbed into a chimney to evade capture .
Halpin was part of a small group of Irish Citizen Army rebels who fought from the roof of City Hall during the Rising .
A search over the course of several hours failed to find the rifle , but did turn up a selection of other artefacts .
Discoveries
A drainpipe blocking access to the gap was removed , to allow archaeologists scoop out and inspect the debris . Broken fragments from the roof , one with a clear bullet hole , were discovered , as well as several glass milk bottles from the 1930s , a teapot lid , and several bits of pottery .

Franc Myles was the consultant archaeologist carrying out the search , financed by Dublin City Council . Speaking after the dig he said the most “ likely scenario ” was the rifle was thrown into the gap , but was discovered and removed in the years immediately after the Rising .
Dublin Castle was a military base during the period , he said , and the headquarters of the Dublin Metropolitan Police special branch , the “ G-men ” .
When the Black and Tans moved in , in 1921 , they would have likely inspected the buildings , “ to see if there were any cracks where explosives might have been hidden , so it 's possible the rifle was recovered then ” , Mr Myles said .
Rodent activity in the gap over the years mixed the debris , so the oldest artefacts were not at the lowest point in the ground as might be expected , he said . “ In fact , we got a King crisp bag from the 1980s right down at the very bottom , beside a piece of pottery which is probably from 1890 , ” he said .

Over the past year the project has been pushed by the Halpin family and Independent councillor Nial Ring , who was recently elected Lord Mayor of Dublin . Despite the disappointment of not finding the rifle , it was “ well worth having a look ” , Mr Ring said .
“ Talking to the family , and looking at Willie 's notes , he definitely threw it over the wall . It would be unthinkable that you 'd hear a story like that and just ignore it , ” he said .

The applications of thermoplastic composites have witnessed significant growth in the aerospace and defense industries , consumer goods , electrical and electronics , and automobile in emerging economies due to rapid urbanization . Constantly rising fuel costs have compelled the aerospace industry to look for lightweight and more fuel efficient designs for its existing models . These factors are expected to drive the market for lightweight composites to achieve sustainable development . The extensive usage of thermoplastic composites in various other segments such as consumer goods and electronics is expected to further augment the thermoplastic composites market .
Growing usage of thermoplastic composite materials in vehicle components such as chassis , wheels , hoods , and roofs in racing and high-performance vehicles is being considered to be a critical driving factor for the growing penetration of thermoplastic composites in the automobile industry . Lower cost for consumers and improvement in product performance through innovation is expected to further augment the market growth . The relatively higher cost of raw materials poses the biggest challenge to the industry and acts as a restraint to an otherwise booming industry . Consumer goods , and electrical and electronics are the other major application segments of thermoplastic composites .
Asia Pacific is expected to be the leading regional market during the next few years on account of the growing population and rapid urbanization in emerging economies such as China and India . Increasing workforce and subsequent development of industrial infrastructure in this region has led to the steady growth of major industries such as automotive , electrical and electronics , aerospace , and consumer goods . Japan , which is among the pioneers in electronics industry , is another market in Asia anticipated to witness steady growth in thermoplastic composites . Europe is expected to follow suit on account of the presence of well-established and influential automotive markets in Germany and Italy .

Europe is also home to some of the biggest players in the aerospace industry , hence the thermoplastic composites market is also expected to rise in that segment . Similar factors are expected to play an important role in the market growth of thermoplastic composites in the North America region , especially the U.S. which houses several automobile and aerospace giants . Latin America is anticipated to witness a steady growth rate during the next few years due to the rise of automotive industry in growing economies such as Brazil .

The St. Vincent High School girls softball team is just two steps away from a North Coast Section championship .
The Lady Mustangs were to play Clear Lake in the semifinals Wednesday . Results of that game were not available at press time . St. Vincent is the No . 2 seed and Clear Lake the No . 3 in the division . The winner will face the winner of the game between Cloverdale and Hoopa for the playoff championship . North Central League I champion Cloverdale is the No . 1 seed . St. Vincent is champion of North Central League II .
After drawing a first-round bye , St. Vincent rode the dominating pitching of Sully Henry to a 5-0 win over Making Waves Academy of San Francisco in the quaterfinals . Henry allowed just one hit and struck out 16 .
St. Vincent , as it always does , played a very difficult pre-league season facing much larger schools . The result was a deceptive 11-7 overall record .
“ We started really slow . It was n't until halfway through the season that we got our lineup set , ” pointed out St. Vincent coach Don Jensen .
Once they hit league and got things sorted out , the Lady Mustangs have rolled , winning eight of their last 10 games , losing only to Terra Linda and St. Vincent Notre Dame during that stretch .
Question : My daughter has been fascinated with aviation for years . Now that she is completing transition year and starting into her Leaving Cert studies , she is as determined as ever to pursue her dream . As parents we do n't want to stand in her way , but I am aware it can be hugely expensive . What options are available ?
Answer : The journey to secure a licence is an incredibly demanding one which requires a range of aptitude and skills possessed by only a small cohort of interested applicants .
They include excellent interpersonal skills , decision-making abilities , a technological aptitude , strong team player with ability to build and maintain positive working relationships , along with excellent analytical and problem-solving skills .
If your daughter believes she fits this profile , she should consider the range of options open to her to achieve her dream .
Aer Lingus recruits a cohort of airline cadets occasionally ; it last did so in 2016 . I would advise her to register her interest online with Aer Lingus and they will let her know when they launch another recruitment programme .
Be warned : competition is fierce . Expect several thousand applicants to apply for fewer than 20 places , so only a fortunate few will achieve their dream through that route .
There are also minimum education standards such as completing the Leaving Cert with grades required for level eight degrees ( Two H4/H5s , Four H/O6s ) . There is also a requirement for a class one medicals as required under EASA ( European Air Safety Agency ) regulations , as well passing a colour blindness test .
A popular though expensive route are private training courses . There are several in Ireland . Check out pilotcareernews.com for more information . If your daughter decides to go this route , it can more than €100,000 .
One of the longest-established is a flight training school based at Cork airport , the Atlantic Flight Training Academy , which provided full time integrated courses .
Some trainee pilots secure their commercial pilots ' licence on a modular basis , enabling them to work in between modules to earn the income to cover the next lump of fees .
There are many similarly high-quality training schools in the UK . There is a flight training exhibition in Croke Park Conference Centre this coming Saturday 24th March ( www.pilotcareernews.com ) .
A further option your daughter might consider is Ireland 's only “ aviation management ” degree at DCU ( DC117 ) , which combines aviation management studies with the option to train as a commercial pilot .
This course would give your daughter a broad insight into all aspects of the structures , operations and management of the aviation industry .
DCU 's aviation management degree does offer a route to professional qualification as a commercial pilot , combined with a strong background in business education .
In the fourth year , the course divides into two streams . Students who opt to pursue integrated flight training do so at Flight Training Europe ( Jerez , Spain ) or Oxford Aviation Academy ( Oxford , UK ) . The cost of such training is not covered by the degree itself and are estimated to be around €100,000 .

The foot bones of a toddler who died 3 million years ago show that baby pre-humans could both walk upright like modern humans and scamper up trees like apes , researchers said Wednesday .
The thumb-sized fossils come from a skeleton discovered in Dikika , Ethiopia in 2002 and they have delivered priceless insights into how modern humans evolved from our distant ancestors , the researchers said .
“ To have a fossil this complete , and to have the fossil of a child , gives us a brand-new window into of what it was like 3 million years ago , ” said Jeremy DeSilva , a paleontologist at Dartmouth University whose team examined the tiny foot bones .
“ Skeletons are rare and skeletons of kids are even rarer . ”

Different teams of experts have looked at various parts of the precious fossil skeleton , which belonged to an Australopithecus afarensis that would have been about 2 ½ years old when she died .
It took years to remove the foot bones from the sandstone it was embedded in , DeSilva told NBC News .
“ This is done grain by grain under the microscope , ” he said .
More like apes or more like humans ?
The bones have been dated to about 3.3 million years ago and identified as the same species as “ Lucy ” , the most famous example of Australopithecus . The toddler bones date to about 200,000 years earlier than Lucy 's , however .
DeSilva 's analysis of the foot shows that baby Australopithecines had features that were similar to both modern humans , and to modern apes , he reports in the journal Science Advances .
“ This is a very humanlike foot , ” he said . “ What is curious is it still retains some apelike features . The toes are slightly curved and longer than a modern human 's . ”
To DeSilva , this suggests that juvenile Australopithecines clung to their parents much as baby apes do today , and probably could climb trees quickly .
Paleontologists who study Australopithecus argue about whether they were more like apes or more like modern humans .
“ Our field has been divided into two camps , with one group saying Lucy and her kind … still climbed trees … and maybe that means they did n't walk as well as we do today , ” DeSilva said .
“ There is another group that says , ‘ Look at these bones . They did walk as we do and these apelike features are just an echo of the past from when their ancestors were still in the trees ' . ”
That 's because , in part , the bones of adult Australopithecus have a heavy heel , made for slamming into the ground , just like modern humans have .
But the baby foot does n't have such a heavy heel .

“ What this baby 's foot allows us to do is introduce a third possibility , ” DeSilva said .
“ That is that the adults were very good walkers , but it is the kids that are climbing up into those trees , ” he added .
That could be for play , just as modern children clamber all over the monkey bars while their parents stay on the ground .
“ But you also do n't see leopards roaming around playgrounds , ” DeSilva pointed out . “ Three million years ago , this environment was filled with predators . ”
`` If you were living in Africa 3 million years ago without fire , without structures , and without any means of defense , you 'd better be able to get up in a tree when the sun goes down . ”
Also , having infants and toddlers that could hold on tight , without having to be carried , would make it much easier for the parents to move around . “ Another thing they did n't have 3 million years ago was strollers , ” DeSilva said .
Modern human babies are born with feet already made for walking , but Australopithecus could have developed strong walking feet in another way , DeSilva said — by using them that way .
“ Bones are living tissues . They grow and respond and they change shape depending on what you do to them , ” he said . “ Even though humans and Lucy 's kind as adults have chunky heels , we developed them in completely different ways . We would never have known that without this fossil . ”
DeSilva , who has twins who were themselves toddlers when he started studying the fossil , says he feels a special attachment to it .
“ This was a toddler who died and it 's really hard to think about when you have your own toddlers , ” he said . “ And yet it is giving us this absolutely extraordinary amount of information about our past and about why we are the way we are today . ”

ORLANDO ( CBSMiami/AP ) – The companies involved in the design and construction of Florida International University 's pedestrian bridge have been named in the first lawsuit filed since its collapse .
Matt Morgan , of Morgan and Morgan , announced that his firm is representing Marquise Hepburn in a civil suit filed Monday morning out of Miami-Dade County .
Morgan said his client was riding his bike to work when the bridge failed , causing a vehicle that veered to get out of the way of the collapse to hit Hepburn , throwing him from his bicycle .
Hepburn suffered spinal injuries during the incident and is still recovering , the attorney said . He has since been discharged from the hospital .
In a press conference held Monday afternoon , Morgan said there were a number of factors his firm plans to dig into , as the collapse is under investigation .
The negligence lawsuit seeks unspecified damages from the entities involved in building the bridge . They include Munilla Construction Management and FIGG Bridge Engineers . Both companies say they will cooperate with multiple investigations into the collapse .
The lawsuit says cracks in the 174-foot span should have been taken seriously and traffic should have been diverted during any testing .
Gallery : Scene of the FIU Bridge Collapse
Southwest 8th Street remains closed indefinitely between 107th Avenue and 117th Avenue as crews work to clear the bridge debris .
On Monday , the university observed a moment of silence 1:47 p.m. , the same time the bridge fell last Thursday , as the first step in healing the community .
A vigil for the six people who died in the collapse is planned for Wednesday .

Police have charged a man with damaging Lichfield 's Christmas Nutcrackers - and the culprit has already agreed to pay for the damage caused .
The colourful 7ft soldiers are dotted around the city as a family-friendly festive trail .

But last weekend , one Nutcracker posted to Market Street was left `` out of action '' due to vandalism and several others sustained damage .
Lichfield BID Manager David Tomalin told the Lichfield Mercury : `` Police have charged the young man with the damage to the nutcracker and drain pipe and he has agreed to pay for the damage caused .
`` Our investigations have continued and we have identified others involved in such activity and they can expect a knock on the door form the police very shortly .
`` Lichfield has over 120 CCTV cameras we will catch you if you cause damage or create problems here in Lichfield - and if drink is involved they will be banned from every pub in town .
`` We take this incident very seriously and we are determined that the actions of a few individuals do not spoil something valued by so many . ''

Dallas Mavericks center Nerlens Noel , left , and Los Angeles Clippers forward Willie Reed fight for a ball during the first half of an NBA basketball game Wednesday , Nov. 1 , 2017 , in Los Angeles . ( AP Photo/Ringo H.W . Chiu )
Jean-Jacques Taylor , Cowboys insider for NBC 5 in Dallas-Fort Worth ( KXAS-TV ) and host of J Dub City 9 a.m.-1 p.m. weekdays on 103.3 KESN-FM , answered your questions in a chat recently . Here are some highlights :
Why ca n't the Mavs close out games ? Is it just youth ?
JJT : The NBA is ruthless when it comes to winning . The best teams have guys who know and understand how to finish at the end of games whether it 's James Harden or LeBron James . We used to have one in Dirk Nowitzki . He had the respect of the NBA officials and he could get anywhere on the court and get his shot off . Now , the Mavs run plays for Harrison Barnes , Dennis Smith Jr. , and Wesley Mathews at the end of games . Until , DSJ becomes the unquestioned best player and becomes a top finisher , then the Mavs will continue to lose games at the end .
Does Nerlens Noel have any trade value ?
JJT : You might be able to get a pair of Jordans and a couple of peanut butter jelly sandwiches for him , but that 's about it . He might get you a second-round pick but I can not see anybody giving the Mavs a No.1 pick for him . He has n't done anything yet .
RANGERS
Not that Shohei Ohtani would have fixed the whole rotation , but is their a way to put together a serviceable ranger rotation this season without him ?
JJT : I ca n't see it . Right now , Martin Perez is your No.2 starter . That not good enough . They have to add a legit No.2 starter , if they 're going to do anything this year . Otherwise , It 's going to be as bad as it feels like it 's going to be .
What roster moves should the Rangers hope to leave the winter meetings with , if any ?
JJT : I have n't spent much attention thinking about what the Rangers need to do because they are n't close to winning right now and we 've been consumed by the Cowboys . I trust Jon Daniels to do the best he can because he 's a good GM and he understands how to build a team . Two years ago , the Rangers had the best record in the AL and Cole Hamels and You Darvish starting the first two playoff games . Both men let him down and it has been a dumpster fire since then .

Parishioners at a church in west Dublin felt an “ extraordinary sense of shock and real horror ” at the news that a 72-year-old woman had been stabbed at her own front door on New Year 's Day , a local priest said .
Bridie Smith was attacked at her home on Oranmore Road in Ballyfermot at about 9.30am on Sunday morning .
Fr Joe McDonald of St Matthew 's Church had been saying Mass when the news began to filter through , he said .
Speaking on RTÉ 's News at One , Fr McDonald said word had come through to the church at about mid-morning .
“ You can imagine the awful shock that people felt when they heard it , ” he said .
He said the initial feeling was one of disbelief and an “ extraordinary sense of shock and real horror ” .
Fr McDonald said the family was part of the parish . “ It 's a closely knit parish , even though we are talking about a city parish in west Dublin , ” he said .
There 's was a “ very strong atmosphere ” based on “ the old idea of good neighbours ” .
“ This has affected people not just right through Oranmore but across the parish . ”
Fr McDonald said Ms Smith had lived in the parish for many years and most of her family lived in the general area of Ballyfermot .
Commenting on the words of Archbishop Diarmuid Martin about a dangerous culture of violence developing across communities , Fr McDonald said :
“ When we go down the road of violence there is no happiness , there is no joy , no peace and all the things we 'd be praying for and wishing for people at the beginning of a new year . An act like this…will always lead to more .
“ The problem is that violence leads to violence - it 's a spiral . And what you end up with is anger and hurt and revenge and where that takes a momentum , all we have is heartache and suffering . ”

Ms Smith is in critical condition in hospital following the attack , which gardaí are treating as an assault causing harm . They are trying to establish a motive for the assault on the pensioner .
No arrests have yet been made and it remained unclear on Sunday night if the assault was carried out by a lone attacker or a group . Locals said a number of men were seen running from the scene .
Ms Smith is believed to have lived in the house for over 30 years , and has a number of children . She was described by locals as a quiet woman who “ kept herself to herself ” .
A growing number of big U.S. credit card issuers are deciding they do n't want to finance digital currency purchases .
JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America , the nation 's two largest banks , said they 're halting purchases of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies on their credit cards . JPMorgan , which will implement the ban on Saturday , does n't want the credit risk associated with the transactions , said Mary Jane Rogers , a spokeswoman for the firm .
Bank of America told staff in a memo that it would start declining credit card transactions with known crypto exchanges on Feb. 2 . The policy applies to all personal and business credit cards issued by the bank . The move does n't affect debit cards , according to Betty Riess , a spokeswoman for the Charlotte , N.C.-based lender .
Bloomberg News
Allowing purchases of cryptocurrencies can create big headaches for card lenders , which can be left on the hook if a borrower bets wrong and ca n't repay . Banks also are required by regulators to monitor customer transactions for signs of money laundering .
But cutting off card purchases has big implications for bitcoin and other virtual currencies , potentially making it more difficult for an enthusiastic public to jump into that market .
Citigroup , the nation 's third-biggest bank , is still reviewing its policy . Capital One and Discover previously said they are n't supporting the transactions .
Discover Chief Executive Officer David Nelms was dismissive of financing cryptocurrency transactions during an interview last month , noting that could change depending on customer demand . For now , “ it 's crooks that are trying to get money out of China or wherever , ” he said of those trying to use the currencies .

Fingal County Council has opened applications for the new first-time buyers ' loan scheme announced by Minister for Housing Eoghan Murphy last week .
Under the scheme , the Government will finance local authorities to provide mortgages to people who have been turned down by banks .
The low-interest rate mortgages will be available to purchasers of properties worth up to €320,000 in the greater Dublin area , Cork and Galway , while the ceiling in the rest of the country will be €250,000 .
The scheme will be reserved for borrowers with an annual gross income of no more than €50,000 , or €75,000 for couples . Central Bank rules will apply so borrowers will be able to take a mortgage for 90 per cent of the property 's value . Borrowers will be able to choose a fixed rate of 2-2.25 per cent over 25-30 years , terms unavailable from any bank .
Paul Reid , chief executive of Fingal County Council said the scheme “ plays a part in addressing one element of the housing crisis and will benefit buyers who do n't qualify for social housing but who also do not earn enough to access the housing market . ”
Margaret Geraghty , Fingal County Council 's Director for Housing said the scheme will be “ significant ” for middle-income earners “ who otherwise are finding it extremely difficult to buy a house ” .
“ It offers residents sustainable and realistic interest rates on their mortgage , ” Ms Geraghty said . “ These remain fixed at 2 per cent over the entire course of the repayments . This not only makes it easier for first time buyers to access the housing market but also helps them to manage their mortgage payments . ”
Fingal County Council said it has administered 1,500 housing loans in the past .
Given the variety of kings , factions and political intrigue throughout the world of The Witcher , it 's only right that its universe be paired with a game that enables Machiavellian-style warfare .
The Witcher Kings is a total conversion for Crusader Kings 2 that 's compatible with the latest version of CK2 , as of two days ago . ( It 's also available through the Steam Workshop , if that 's easier . )
It 's pretty straightforward : it turns the Paradox grand strategy game into a battle of international politics , warfare and diplomacy with all the Witcher characters you know and love . The mod itself is set in 1274 and concentrates largely on the events in The Witcher 2 , rather than Geralt 's most recent adventure .

For added immersion , you can combine this mod with the Witcher 3 Music for CK2 mod , which is also on the Steam Workshop . But if you just want to start planning your wedding to Geralt and taking over Redania , head to the Witcher Kings listing here .

The video for Maroon 5 's “ Cold ” is on its way and to whet their fan 's appetites the band released a teaser featuring Adam Levine and his Victoria 's Secret model wife Behati Prinsloo . In the clip , Levine recounts an acid trip triggered by a strange incident during a night out .
“ It was weird . Somebody slipped something into my drink , ” Levine says . “ I think it was acid because I started tripping balls . Future turned into a teddy bear and James was getting blown by a chicken . It was crazy . ”

“ I got arrested when the cops came , but they were n't really the cops , ” he says . “ It was like this adorable little cartoon stripper and she gave me an adorable little cartoon lap dance . That was weird , and then these two girls pulled me into a room for a threesome . ”
The twisted tale goes on and on , perhaps signaling some spoilers for the full video . In the teaser , disinterested Prinsloo just wants to go back to bed .

How to Lead
In the second feature of our new weekly series — for readers who are interested in what makes good leadership — is Rupert Soames , the Serco CEO , on how to manage a company in crisis .
Andrew Hill 's challenge
The FT 's management editor sets a weekly test of your business , strategy and management skills .
No matter that Toys R Us filed for bankruptcy protection in the US in September , toys ARE still us — and some toy stores continue to thrive . I picked what was once my local Manhattan toy store , West Side Kids , in my column this week as an example of how a combination of community ties , adaptability and good fortune helped it survive , while bigger names were falling around it .
That said , as the owner told me , `` we ca n't be complacent '' . Amazon remains a potent force in toy retail , for example . So my challenge this week is to write a short strategy — three points , if that — for independent toy shops to survive , and thrive , for the next 10 years . Send your thoughts to bschool @ ft.com , as always .
Last week , I asked for a three-point charter that could govern the relationship between Kind Snacks and its new investor , Mars . Sandra Pickering , who describes herself as `` a former Mars associate '' , points to the confectionery group 's five existing principles — Mutuality , Responsibility , Quality , Efficiency , Freedom — as a good starting point . For example , she says , `` Freedom is Mars 's way of expressing a long-term outlook not controlled by stock market short-term needs . I 'd guess that Daniel Lubetzky , the founder of Kind , will appreciate the importance of that '' .
In further reading this week , Eric Berger of Ars Technica describes the consequences of the catastrophic fire that killed three astronauts in Apollo 1 on the launch pad in 1967 . It 's a long read , but his compelling argument is that by denting the Nasa team 's feeling of invincibility , and triggering urgent changes to the whole mission to the moon , the tragedy actually guaranteed later success . Most notably , Austrian refugee George Low , who took over as Apollo program office manager , `` changed people , thinking , and culture in a short period of time , and ... rescued a spacecraft that was seriously flawed '' . The management trick , of course , is to find a way of achieving such motivation before disaster strikes .
Professor 's picks
Every week a business school professor or academic recommends useful FT articles .
Bent Flyvbjerg , BT professor and chair of Major Programme Management at University of Oxford 's Saïd Business School , selects :
UK to hold more offshore wind and green energy auctions in 2019 The article illustrates the divergent paths in energy infrastructure . On one hand , is the investment and construction of nuclear power installations , which nearly always suffer from large cost and time overruns . Despite hundreds of power stations built around the world , lessons are not learnt .
The alternative is renewable technologies , which due to their modular design can be scaled quickly , so construction times and costs are less , with immediate returns on investment .
Whilst renewables are still subsidised , the cost of producing This is falling . The cost of renewables is now lower than conventional sources . This is placing more pressure on big energy projects such as Hinckley Point Nuclear Power Station .
French-backed Finnish nuclear plant delayed again The long running saga of the Olkiluoto-3 plant is a classic example of the inherent risks within megaprojects . Currently , Olkiluoto-3 is nearly 10 years late and costs are running at three times the original €3.2bn budget .
Nuclear power is subject to what economists call “ negative learning curves , ” which designate the situation that the more we learn about nuclear power , the more costly it gets to build nuclear power plants ( mainly due to high and increasing safety standards over the past many decades ) . This is a case study of how not to run a megaproject .

Bitcoin is not just a hot topic of conversation these days , given the digital currency 's meteoric rise in value this week . It can also get you into business school . Bulgaria 's Varna University of Management is offering a €1,000 bitcoin scholarship for applicants to its computer sciences degree .
Business education is in the midst of trying to evolve to a changing corporate landscape , brought on by digitisation . In an age where the cost of doing things is dramatically reduced by putting these online , the human skills of communication , critical thinking and the ability to work in teams only increase . It also creates demand for new technical competencies such as data analysis.How you pay for this learning will also be up for review . However , for most schools , moving to bitcoin might be a step too far .

About 13 years ago , the founder of eDrop-Off Corri McFadden was in her last year of college when she had an ingenious idea for her senior project : an eBay ( NASDAQ : EBAY ) store for gently-used luxury goods . Since then , McFadden has grown her business to a multi-million dollar company with 37 employees .
So how did she do it ?
Her eBay Success Story
From the beginning , McFadden had a business plan that was solid enough to convince Chase Bank to give her a line of credit that she would partly use to rent a 600-square-foot store in Chicago 's Lincoln Park .
Far from the Balenciaga bags and Burberry coats that she sells today , McFadden 's first box of inventory consisted of fly fishing equipment , Beanie Babies and roller blades , but as her clientele grew she realized that she would make much more selling designer clothing and so she shifted her attention to ladies with superfluous high-end fashion .
She also rebranded her business to cater to women who found the consignment concept unappealing . Since 2006 , EDrop-Off has been offering “ closet consultations. ” A staff member will go to customers ' homes and help them with wardrobe arrangements and offer quotes for items that they would like to sell . eDrop-Off then sells the discarded items on behalf of the customer .
Today , eDrop-Off sells about 1,500 items every week , charging 40 percent commission off the selling price for each item . About 20 percent of McFadden 's listings are available for immediate purchase using eBay 's ‘ Buy It Now ' option and the rest ( 80 percent ) of her listings are available through auctions .
Two lessons potential eBay entrepreneurs can take from McFadden 's experience are these . First , it is important to create your own niche and own it . Second , eBay businesses can be much more than just a source of extra money gathered from selling stuff in your attic .

The State has unconditionally apologised to a family who claimed they were harassed and intimidated by gardaí who called to their home on several occasions asking about a person who did not live there .
The apology was made before the High Court to members of the Topolnicki family , who live at Ashmount , Clonsilla , Dublin 15 .
Mr Justice Paul Gilligan heard the State was offering them an unconditional apology and it was accepted gardaí had made a mistake by calling to the wrong address .
Originally from Poland , the family said they are law abiding citizens , have no criminal convictions , do not associate with criminals and have never been involved with the police in any jurisdiction .
They took proceedings after gardaí called to their home on eight different occasions over the last three years .
They sought various reliefs including orders restraining gardaí entering or attending at their home unless under the authority of a valid warrant issued by a court of law .
They also sought an order restraining gardaí watching , besetting , harassing or intimidating any member of the family , including brothers Marek and Patryk Topolnicki and their wives Malgorzata and Kinga .
The family , represented by Pat O'Connell SC and Breffni Gordon BL , had sued the Garda Commissioner , the Minister for Justice , Ireland and the Attorney General .
They claimed gardaí first called to the house sometime in 2014 , saying they were looking for a person who may have previously resided at the premises .
The gardaí were told that person did not live there , they said .
On another occasion in March 2016 , up to 12 gardaí arrived at the house and had banged on doors and windows .
Marek Topolnicki claimed , when he opened the door , he was pushed inside and six to eight gardai forcibly entered and roamed around the house .
This upset and traumatised the family , who said they were given no information by gardaí and the atmosphere in the house was dreadful .
ADVERTISEMENT
He said they did not have a warrant and , before leaving the house , a member of the Garda party gave him a document to sign which Mr Topolnicki was told was a confirmation no damage had occurred during the search .
Following that incident , the family said their home was watched by gardaí , who also called to their door on a number of other occasions .
On another occasion , gardaí called to their home at 2am and remained outside for a time with the lights of their vehicle on and the engine running , it was claimed .
The family , originally from Krakow but living and working here for several years , previously got undertakings from gardaí they would not enter or intrude or attend at the family 's home unless under the authority of a valid warrant .
When the matter returned before the court , Mr Justice Gilligan was told by Mr O'Connell the injunctions matter had been settled and could be struck out with the family to get their legal costs .
The Santa Barbara County Parks Department is making a change that spells big trouble for people who enjoy the Goleta Pier .
What 's not to like about the Goleta Pier ? It 's a great community- and family-oriented fishing pier with something very rare — a rock-covered pipeline with kelp growth within casting distance . That pipeline holds plenty of fish our anglers are interested in . Besides fishing , the scenery is gorgeous , making it a favorite place for lovers and nature buffs to take an outdoors stroll .
Know what would really mess up the place ? For starters , trash , discarded fishing line and gear , vandalism , graffiti and unrestrained gang activity . Our Goleta Beach pier is fairly free of all that bad stuff thanks to an arrangement with a wonderful man , Boyd Grant . He has been the park host for the past few years , during which time the pier has been cleaned up in more ways than one .
An Angler 's Center was developed on the pier ( by the United Pier and Shore Anglers of California ) , and Boyd spends much of his time there . He cleans up the pier , teaches people about fishing and the environment , keeps an eye on the bad elements who show up periodically , and he generally keeps the area a great place for family fun .
The county 's Park Host Program facilitates such rare and beneficial arrangements , by providing an RV hookup for the host . To keep up his end of the bargain , Boyd puts in countless hours volunteering as a maintenance and cleanup person around the park . This is in addition to the copious amounts of time he puts in on the pier and helping pier fishers .
Looks like a situation we would n't want to change , right ? Oddly enough , new management in the county Parks Department is dismissing Boyd . They claim the host program is designed for 18-month stints , but I understand that other hosts have been in place much longer .
Booting out Boyd seems plain nuts to me . A better match between host and function/need has perhaps never been encountered .
Boyd is perfect for Goleta Pier and the good people who use it . He wants to stay . We want him to stay . The county Parks Department needs to rethink this scenario and come up with a plan to keep Boyd , if it has n't already alienated him .

The U.S. Navy is exploring whether it can achieve significant savings in parts and labor by buying its next two aircraft carriers together instead of individually , the service 's top weapons buyer said .
The Navy intends to deploy 12 aircraft carriers , up from the 11 today , as a key part of its planned expansion to 355 ships . In a request for proposals on Monday , the Navy asked shipbuilder Huntington Ingalls Industries Inc. “ to further define the cost savings achievable ” if it makes a block purchase of the third and fourth carriers in the new Ford class .

A two-ship commitment would provide a major boost in revenue for Huntington Ingalls and its subcontractors , including General Atomics , which makes the aircraft launch and recovery system .
The proposal is a vote of confidence in the carrier program despite its history so far of major cost increases and delays . The first carrier in the class , the USS Gerald R. Ford , has become the costliest warship ever -- with a budget now capped by Congress at $ 12.9 billion -- and it was delivered at least 32 months later than originally scheduled .
Huntington Ingalls also was falling short last year of a Navy goal to reduce the hours of labor on the second ship by 18 percent compared with the first .
Must Show Savings
For the Navy to commit to two carriers at once , the contractors working on it must demonstrate significant savings , such as in hours of labor or reductions in costs from suppliers , James Geurts , the Navy 's top weapons buyer told reporters . “ Is there a more affordable way to buy those two ? ” he asked .
Mike Petters , chief executive officer of Newport News , Virginia-based Huntington Ingalls , said in an email that “ we believe the most effective way to reduce cost of aircraft carriers is to take a multi-ship purchase approach and build them every three to four years . Buying two ships at once stabilizes the Newport News Shipbuilding workforce and their national supplier base , allows us to buy materials in quantity , and phase work more efficiently . ”
Members of Congress have backed the administration 's move toward maintaining a 12-carrier fleet , as new ships are added and older ones are retired , but details about timing of funding , construction and delivery have yet to be worked out .
More than 100 lawmakers -- led by the delegation from Virginia , where the carriers are built -- wrote Defense Secretary Jim Mattis in December urging a dual-buy procurement .
The Navy 's fiscal year 2019 budget includes a request to fund the third Ford-class carrier , the USS Eisenhower , and plans fiscal 2023 as the first year of full funding for what would be the fourth , a ship still to be named that would replace the USS Carl Vinson when it 's retired . Congress must approve the request .
This drunk driving suspect says she 's just a follower of Christ .
After allegedly boozing behind the wheel Sunday night , Nicole Ann Mintner defended herself to police by telling arresting officers that “ Jesus drank wine and so did I , ” The Village News reported .
Deputies said they found the 45-year-old asleep at the wheel inside a silver Dodge with her hazard lights activated and engine running in Sumter County , Fla .
During police interviews , Mintner reportedly refused to take off her sunglasses and slapped an officer twice on the shoulder .
She told officers that she had taken Xanax then later admitted to drinking alcohol after four empty sangria bottles were found in her center console .
Mintner was placed under arrest and into the back of a patrol car where she “ continuously ” screamed and threatened to urinate while en route to Sumter County Detention Center , according to deputies .
When they arrived at the jail , officers attempted to perform field sobriety tests on Minter but she kept talking over them and began singing “ Amazing Grace , ” according to the Village News .
She also reportedly threw her socks at a camera recording the tests and exposed herself to the officers .
“ The defendant removed her right breast from her shirt and completely revealed it to the camera and jail staff , ” according to the police report obtained by the newspaper .
Mintner was booked on charges of driving under the influence , battery on a law enforcement officer and resisting an officer . She was released Monday on $ 6,000 bond , according to court records .

Two ticketing companies paid $ 1.6 million to secure the rights to resell Irish tickets at the Olympic games , a report has found .
Mr Justice Carroll Moran 's inquiry into the Rio 2016 ticket touting controversy was published in full on Monday , but cited a lack of co-operation from a number of key witnesses as a “ major impediment ” to its work .
Former Olympic Council of Ireland ( OCI ) president Pat Hickey , the OCI 's ticket reseller THG , Ireland 's ticket resellers for the Rio games Pro10 , the International Olympic Committee and the Rio Organising Committee of the Olympic Games declined to assist Mr Justice Moran in his work .
The parties availed of their right against self-incrimination , the judge said , while acknowledging and respecting that position .
However , he said his findings were based only on the contributions of those who were willing or able to participate as a consequence .
His final report found THG , a British-owned ticketing firm , paid $ 1 million for the rights to access OCI tickets for the games in London 2012 and the winter games in Sochi 2014 . Pro10 paid $ 600,000 for the same in Rio .
“ This was done without an explanation being given at the time as to how it would recoup this sum or earn a return on such a large outlay , ” Mr Justice Moran said .
Commercial interests
Mr Justice Moran said the OCI had prioritised its commercial interests over the concerns of athletes . The agreements reached with THG and Pro10 showed little concern for the athletes , their friends , relatives and supporters , or for those of the spectating public .
The inquiry was established after a senior executive at THG was arrested in Rio last year carrying tickets that came from the OCI and Pro10 . Pro10 was the authorised reseller or distributor of tickets for the OCI after THG 's bid was rejected by the Rio Organising Committee .
In spite of this , the investigation found a long-standing relationship between Mr Hickey and chief executive Marcus Evans , the UK owner of THG .
Mr Justice Moran said Mr Hickey sought to conceal the relationship , which continued up until his arrest in August 2016 .
His report concluded that THG remained the effective reseller at the 2016 games and Pro10 was not a genuine distributor but “ its involvement disguised the continuing role of THG and Marcus Evans as the real or de facto ” reseller .
Great lengths
The report says Mr Hickey strongly supported the application of THG as the ticket distributor , and found he went to “ great lengths ” to allay any concerns raised about the company .
“ When this failed , one of the early options considered by Mr Evans and communicated to Mr Hickey was the formation of a new company to act as the ATR [ authorised ticket reseller ] with some contractual and/or agency relationship with the OCI and the Marcus Evans group . ”
This suggestion was followed shortly after by the registration of Pro10 as a business name . The judge said the firm was not genuine , and provided an inadequate and chaotic service .
Individuals who bought tickets from THG or Pro10 could not be traced , the report said , and Mr Justice Moran said he could not put a number on how many tickets the agents sold , at what price or with what offer of hospitality .
The report also found Mr Hickey was paid €60,000 a year from 2010 to 2015 while president of the OCI , which represented some 5 per cent of the organisation 's annual income . He received €360,000 in 2015 .
Marketing executive
It was paid for his “ endeavours ” as a marketing executive , and his efforts to get “ substantial sponsorship agreements ” .
Mr Justice Moran also recommends against establishing a statutory commission of investigation into the controversy .
Minister for Transport Shane Ross said he accepted and agreed with the position of the judge .
“ It is regrettable that the parties concerned chose not to assist Judge Moran in his inquiries . I believe that if they had co-operated this report would be more complete . ”
The cost of the inquiry , which began its work on September 19th , 2016 , was €312,765 .

Aston Villa cut the gap on second-placed Derby County by beating Burton Albion .
The Brewers were without on-loan Rams striker Darren Bent . He injured himself in the 3-1 defeat by Reading in midweek and did n't train with Nigel Clough 's side on Friday .
Villa broke the deadlock just after the half-hour mark when Scott Hogan tapped in after good work from Robert Snodgrass and Albert Adomah .
Adomah made it 2-0 after being played in by Snodgrass but Ahmed Elmohamady put the ball in his own net to give the Brewers hope .

Reproductive hormones that develop during puberty are not responsible for changes in social behavior that may occur during adolescence , research shows .
“ Changes in social behavior during adolescence appear to be independent of pubertal hormones . They are not triggered by puberty , so we ca n't blame the hormones , ” says Matthew Paul , an assistant professor in the psychology department at the University at Buffalo and lead author of a new paper that appears in Current Biology .
Disentangling the adolescent changes that are triggered by puberty from those unrelated to puberty is difficult because puberty and adolescence occur simultaneously , but Paul and his collaborators have found a way to tease out the two using a seasonal-breeding animal model .

“ Puberty and adolescence are happening at the same time . So if you want to know if one causes the other , one of the elements must be moved . We have no way of doing that in a human , but we have found a way to do it using Siberian hamsters , ” says Paul .
The new model provides a basic understanding that did n't previously exist for what drives adolescent social development .
Adolescence is a critical period of development for individuals , Paul says . Complex thinking develops ; mental health disorders arise ; and it 's associated with the beginning of high-risk behaviors , like drug use .
For social behavior , it 's a time when the focus of children 's social relationships shifts from the family to peers . In other words , they stop wanting to hang out with mom and dad . It has been widely assumed that these changes can be attributed to increases in gonadal hormones at puberty .
“ What we 've done here is found a new way to ask the question of how puberty plays a role in adolescent development—a new way to determine which developmental changes pubertal hormones trigger and which changes they do not . ”
Defining ‘ puberty ' and ‘ adolescence '
In conversation , we might hear puberty and adolescence used interchangeably , yet biologically , they are two distinct processes .
Puberty is the process by which individuals develop the ability to reproduce . It is triggered by the activation of the reproductive axis , which is responsible for the development of reproductive capability , the appearance of secondary sexual characteristics , and the increase in gonadal hormones .
Adolescence is broader . It encompasses puberty , but also includes cognitive , social , and emotional changes that occur during the teenage years .
Because puberty and adolescence occur concurrently , answering the fundamental question of whether puberty causes non-reproductive adolescent behavioral changes or merely coincides with them has confounded researchers—until now .
From play to dominance
Using a seasonal breeding species , like Siberian hamsters , allowed researchers to control the timing of puberty .
Siberian hamsters born at the beginning of the breeding season ( when days are long ) go through puberty quickly in order to breed that year . Those born late in the breeding season ( when days are shorter ) experience a delay in puberty so as not to give birth in the middle of winter .
Controlling the amount of light a hamster receives in the lab can delay arrival of puberty , which comes around 30 days of age for “ long-day ” hamsters and around 100 days of age or later for “ short-day ” hamsters .
With two groups going through puberty at different times , researchers can observe behavioral changes in each group to determine whether these changes are always locked to puberty . In the current study , they looked at the transition from play-fighting to social dominance , which is an important step for these young animals to be able to leave home and find their own territory ( also called dispersal ) .
“ Play is an important behavior in many species , especially mammals , ” Paul says . “ It 's evolutionarily conserved , meaning it has n't been lost from a common ancestor as species broke off from each other in the evolutionary tree . Because play is expressed in so many species , it 's likely to be serving an important function , including in humans . It also suggests that what we learn from our hamsters will likely be true for many other species . ”
If pubertal hormones were responsible for the shift from play to dominance , this transition would occur early for long-day hamsters and late for short-day hamsters ; always co-occuring with puberty . But researchers found that the transition occurred at the same time for both groups , regardless of when they went through puberty . For the short-day hamsters , the transition was completed before puberty had even begun .
“ This is a surprising finding , because we tend to think that pubertal hormones are responsible for the changes we see during adolescence . But our research suggests otherwise. ” says Paul .
“ These findings are also important for adolescent mental health—understanding the underlying mechanisms responsible for adolescent development will provide insight into why so many mental health disorders arise during this time in life . ”

The European Commission is investigating whether Ryanair received illegal state aid from regional and local authorities in France .
The news comes as the airline faces a possible strike by Irish-based pilots and potential industrial unrest on other fronts .
Margrethe Vestager , EU competition commissioner , said yesterday that Brussels is investigating whether an agreement between Ryanair and the Association for the Promotion of Touristic and Economic Flows ( APFTE ) that the airline promote the area around Montpellier airport amounted to illegal state aid .
EU law bans state aid to businesses where it distorts normal commercial competition and gives them an unfair advantage .
According to Ms Vestager , Ryanair received substantial payments from APFTE for promoting Montpellier as a tourist destination on its website .
The association is an independent organisation , not connected to Montpellier airport , that is almost entirely funded by regional and local public bodies . The commission said that it had therefore concluded “ on a preliminary basis ” that the French state paid for APFTE 's deal with Ryanair .
Economic advantage
“ We will investigate whether regional and local authorities in France granted an undue economic advantage to Ryanair over its competitors , potentially harming other European airlines and having spill-over effects to other European regions , ” Ms Vestager said .
In response , the airline said : “ All of Ryanair 's airport arrangements comply fully with EU state aid rules and we are confident that the EU will find our Montpellier deal is in line with EU state aid rules . ”
Montpellier airport is in the French region of Occitanie . About 1.9 million people travelled through there in 2017 .
Following a meeting organised by the International Transport Workers ' Federation , Ryanair cabin crew yesterday published a charter of demands covering pay , rosters , contracts , sick pay and pressure to make in-flight sales .
Earlier this week , directly employed members of the Irish Airline Pilots ' Association in Ryanair voted for industrial action in a dispute over seniority . They plan a one-day strike on Thursday , July 12th .

A severe ice warning has been issued for Tamworth as freezing temperatures are set to plummet to even further .
After several inches of snow covered the town on Sunday , weather forecasters on Monday said temperatures would fall to a low of minus nine degrees centigrade .
A clear night was forecast by the Met Office with sunny spells throughout Tuesday . But with temperatures not rising above ZERO the snow and ice is set to remain over the next couple of days .
Temperatures could rise slightly by Wednesday and Thursday , with some rain being forecast before the end of the week .
Drivers are being warned to be aware of icy roads and pavements , and say travel disruption will continue .
Dairy farmers whose herds are culled through the Mycoplasma bovis eradication programme could be back in business within months , but for most it will take years to rebuild their herds to full strength , DairyNZ 's Andrew Reid said .
The 39 infected properties have been earmarked for `` depopulation '' , which means all their stock will be killed .
Reid , who is DairyNZ 's general manager for the farmer-funded body 's team of advisers , said the process of restoring herds will depend on stock availability and the price farmers are prepared to pay .
`` It 's no easy feat by any means , given the time of year that some of this culling is taking place , '' he said .

Farmers sourcing new herds will also have to understand the history the herd , including getting M. bovis records of tests from the autumn , which should be part of sale agreements .
`` Herds get bought and sold each year , '' he said .
`` In the context of the greater industry it is manageable , but the laws of supply and demand , when there are not many herds for sale , will drive the market - not just stock prices but the availability as well , '' he said .
There is a stand-down period of 60 days for infected farms after they have been depopulated , during which time farms are cleaned and disinfected .
Getting herds back to their former size and quality will take time for some .
`` In many circumstances , generations of breeding programmes have been wiped out through the culling programme . So as well as the production implications there is the emotional toll that farmers are going through , '' he said . `` Getting a herd of the same quality could take a considerable period of time . ''
Reid said getting rid of existing herds will be testing for farmers .
`` Seeing good quality stock loaded onto a truck will be a pretty traumatic experience , '' he said .
Cows can be milked at 2 years of age , and the typical lifespan of a dairy cow varies from 6 to 10 years .
For most farmers , the season officially ends today . It will be two months before new season production resumes .
Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern this week announced that the Government and farming sector leaders had agreed to try to eradicate the cattle disease Mycoplasma bovis from New Zealand to protect the national herd and the long-term productivity of the farming sector . She said the country had `` one shot '' at getting rid of the disease , which causes painful , untreatable illness in cattle .
The decision to eradicate was taken collectively by Government and farming sector bodies after months of intense modelling and analysis .
Vegas Golden Knights James Neal ( 18 ) scores the game winner against Dallas Stars goalie Kari Lehtonen ( 32 ) in the third period of Vegas ' 2-1 win during the Dallas Stars vs. the Vegas Golden Knights NHL hockey game at American Airlines Center in Dallas on Friday , October 6 , 2017 . ( Louis DeLuca/The Dallas Morning News )
`` To win the first game was awesome . The guys played really hard . We did everything we could to win the game , and we did . It was awesome . ''
`` We just had to come together as a team really quick , '' Neal said . `` We come out starting against a tough team . Like I said , with everything that 's happened and gone on in Vegas , this is going to be a point where we can rally behind the city and shed some light on a terrible situation .
Both teams wore Vegas Strong decals on their helmets , and the Stars players stood behind the Golden Knights players during the playing of the national anthem . It was a powerful moment , Neal said .
Neal scored twice Friday , including the game-winner on an assist from Eakin , in leading the Vegas Golden Knights to a 2-1 win over the Stars . It was a huge win for the expansion team , especially when you consider the city still is recovering from a shooter 's attack .
Neal was activated Friday from injured reserve , as he missed training camp because of offseason surgery for a broken hand . But he looked sharp on both goals and also when barreling over Stars center Tyler Seguin on a big hit . He helped Nashville to the Stanley Cup finals before being selected in the expansion draft .
`` Yeah , ever since I was picked in the expansion draft in Las Vegas , it 's pretty crazy the way everything 's worked out , '' Neal said . `` I started my career here in Dallas , so it was funny coming back here my first game a new team and a fresh start .
`` It was great . I was excited . I did n't want to miss this one , so it was awesome . ''
It also was pretty crazy how it worked out for the Stars .
Dallas ' season ended in disappointment as the Stars finished 24th and missed the playoffs . They decided to not renew coach Lindy Ruff 's contract , hired Ken Hitchcock as their new coach and acquired big pieces in Ben Bishop , Martin Hanzal , Alexander Radulov , Marc Methot and Tyler Pitlick . That made Dallas the heaviest team in the NHL at 210 pounds per player and also restructured how the Stars played on the ice .
So there was a lot of anticipation for Friday 's game .
`` I 'm just tired of reading all of the predictions and all of the experts , '' Hitchcock said before the game . `` I 'm ready to see what we 've got . ''
What he saw was a team was a lot . Dallas controlled the puck and finished with a 46-30 advantage in shots on goal . It killed all seven penalties . It got a sweet power-play goal from Seguin . And it fell apart in the third period after goalie Ben Bishop was forced to leave the game with a cut in the head . Neal scored twice on replacement goalie Kari Lehtonen , who took the loss .
Bishop was hit in the mask on a shot from another former Stars player , Reilly Smith . He had a cut on his head and had to go into the concussion protocol program . Although Bishop returned to the bench , he was not allowed to return to the game .
Lehtonen was beaten on Neal 's shot through a crowd , and then the entire defense broke down when Eakin was sprung with a breakout pass . Eakin drew both Stephen Johns and Dan Hamhuis to him , and then fed Neal .
`` Yeah , just trying to be available for [ Eakin ] to get it over , '' Neal said . `` Obviously , he had a guy on his back , and he just put it over there . I think it hit off my skate . I just tried to do everything I could just to give myself a chance to get it on net . I saw that Kari [ Lehtonen ] was down , so I just tried to get it up . I do n't know . Honestly , it was just a great feeling , so it was a lot of fun out there . ''
In the end , it was not so fun for the Stars .
`` It 's a process , and we 'll take it step by step , '' he said . `` We 'll find out how we look in these first two games , and then we 'll go from there . ''
A new study suggests that the moon 's magnetic field from a dynamo in its liquid metallic core ( inner red sphere ) lasted 1 billion years longer than thought .
Subscribe Let our news meet your inbox . SIGN UP
The moon 's magnetic field lasted at least 1 billion years longer than previously thought , a new study finds . This suggests that alien moons and planets may also have magnetic fields that can survive for a long time and potentially help shelter extraterrestrial life .
The moon today does not possess a global magnetic field . However , prior analyses of moon rocks retrieved by the Apollo astronauts suggested that , between 3.56 billion and 4.25 billion years ago , the moon 's magnetic field once ranged in strength from 20 to 110 microteslas . In comparison , Earth 's magnetic field is 50 microteslas strong .
Previous research also suggested that the moon 's magnetic field had declined in intensity to less than 4 microteslas by 3.19 billion years ago . However , researchers were n't sure what happened after that point — whether it died out shortly thereafter or lingered in a weakened state before dissipating completely . [ How the Moon Was Made : 5 Wild Theories ]
Understanding more about the nature of the magnetic field of Earth 's moon could shed light on the magnetic fields of distant moons and planets , which could influence their habitability , according to the researchers who conducted the new study . Earth 's magnetic field protects its oceans and its life from dangerous radiation from the sun ; the death of Mars ' magnetic field could help explain why the Red Planet is now dry and apparently lifeless .
`` Magnetic fields can shield planets from stellar winds which can strip atmospheres of water , which is important for planetary habitability , '' study lead author Sonia Tikoo , a lunar geophysicist at Rutgers University in New Brunswick , New Jersey , told Space.com .
Probing the moon 's magnetic field
To learn more about the evolution of the moon 's magnetic field , Tikoo and her colleagues examined a lunar rock collected in 1971 from the southern rim of Dune Crater within eastern Mare Imbrium , the vast lava plain known as the `` Sea of Rains . '' The small , young rock , known as Apollo 15 sample 15498 , was partially coated with melted glass , and likely formed during a meteor impact on the moon 's surface .
A number of lunar rocks such as 15498 recorded the strength and direction of the moon 's ancient magnetic field . Such rocks contain thousands of tiny metallic grains that , like compass needles , lined up with the direction of the lunar magnetic field as the rocks cooled from a molten state long ago . [ How the Moon Evolved : A Photo Timeline ]
Until recently , the scientists were unable to find lunar samples much younger than 3.2 billion years old that could accurately record the moon 's magnetic fields .
`` There are very few lunar rocks that are younger than about 3 billion years old , because right around then , the moon cooled off , volcanism largely ceased and , along with it , formation of new igneous rocks on the lunar surface , '' study co-author Benjamin Weiss at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology said in a statement .
Instead of forming from volcanic lava early in the moon 's history , 15498 was born from the heat of a cosmic impact much later , the researchers found . Specifically , it was about 1 billion to 2.5 billion years old .
The scientists first measured 15498 's natural magnetic properties using a very sensitive magnetometer . They next exposed the rock to a known magnetic field in the lab , and heated the rock to 1,436 degrees Fahrenheit ( 780 degrees Celsius ) , close to the extreme temperatures in which it originally formed .
`` You see how magnetized it gets from getting heated in that known magnetic field , then you compare that field to the natural magnetic field you measured beforehand , and from that you can figure out what the ancient field strength was , '' Weiss said in the statement .
This moon rock sample , collected by Apollo 15 astronauts , is made of basalt fragments welded together by a dark glassy matrix that was produced by melting from a meteorite impact . MIT and Rutgers scientists studied the sample to glean new insights about the ancient moon 's magnetic field NASA
A long-lasting lunar dynamo
These experiments revealed that the moon still harbored a weak magnetic field about 5 microteslas strong from 1 billion to 2.5 billion years ago . In comparison , the moon is about 4.5 billion years old .
All in all , these findings suggest `` that even small planetary bodies can generate long-lived magnetic fields operating on billion-year timescales , so it is possible that small exoplanets or exomoons might be able to preserve water on timescales long enough to permit life to develop , '' Tikoo said .
Flowing metal in Earth 's core serves as the dynamo that generates our planet 's magnetic field . It remains a mystery how the lunar dynamo could have lasted so long after the moon was born , researchers said .
`` It was generally thought that planetary bodies as small as the moon could not have magnetic fields lasting for billions of years because their small sizes would cause their cores to cool and run out of energy to power a dynamo relatively early in solar system 's history , '' Tikoo said . `` Therefore , showing that the moon generated a field that lasted at for least 2 billion years , either in a continuous or intermittent state , really pushes the boundaries on what we thought was possible . It challenges us to think of new power sources and mechanisms that can help give the cores of small bodies an energy boost . ''
The researchers suggest that the moon 's dynamo may have been driven by two distinct mechanisms — one involving Earth 's gravity , and the other involving the cooling of the moon 's core .
`` The lunar magnetic field seems to have operated for a long time in two different strength ranges , '' Tikoo said . `` This tells us that the moon may have had two different mechanisms operating throughout its history — a stronger-field mechanism before 3.5 billion years ago and a weaker-field mechanism later on . ''
`` We think that the early strong-field period may have been powered a relatively exotic mechanism — the Earth 's gravitational pull on the lunar mantle may have mechanically churned the conducting fluid in the lunar core to drive the dynamo , '' Tikoo said . `` We think this process could have generated enough energy to explain the strong field period .
`` The late lunar dynamo field we inferred from this study was likely powered by slow solidification of the moon 's core , '' Tikoo said . `` As the moon cooled off over time , the molten iron in the core began to solidify like water freezing to ice . This process can release thermal energy and cause hot , buoyant liquid metal to rise in the core like the fluid in a lava lamp . That combination of heat release and buoyancy-driven motion can prove the extra boost needed to power a long-lived magnetic field . ''
Future research will examine just how long the lunar magnetic field lasted , and whether it operated continuously over its lifetime , Tikoo said .
The scientists detailed their findings online today ( Aug. 9 ) in the journal Science Advances .

Iran has pre-qualified 29 companies from more than a dozen countries to bid for oil and gas projects using the new , less restrictive Iran Petroleum Contract ( IPC ) model .
The list included Shell , France 's Total , Italy 's Eni , Malaysia 's Petronas and Russia 's Gazprom and Lukoil , as well as companies from China , Austria , Japan among other countries , Shana reported .
Iran hopes the new IPC , which offers to sweeten the terms for oil development deals , will attract foreign investors and boost production after years of sanctions .
State-run National Iranian Oil Company ( NIOC ) signed the first oil output contract based on IPC model in October , 2016 with an Iranian firm .
Iran aims to attract $ 200 billion in oil and gas investment over the next five years , after the 2015 agreement with the world 's major powers to modify its nuclear program led to the lifting of international sanctions .
Total of France became the first Western oil major to make a renewed commitment when it signed a deal in October to develop the next phase of Iran 's giant South Pars Gas Field together with China National Petroleum Corp .
UK-listed Shell followed earlier December with a more tentative agreement for studies of the Azadegan and Yadavaran oilfields in southwest Iran as well as the Kish gas fields in Persian Gulf .
Jason Rosychuk , a Dubai-based oil and gas specialist at Pinsent Masons , the law firm , said that , after a slow start , Tehran 's investment drive was gaining momentum . `` The level of interest is high , '' he said . `` All companies are taking a look . ''
Few countries have benefited from the oil market 's 2016 recovery like Iran . Since sanctions on its economy were eased , the Persian Gulf producer has doubled exports as prices rallied and won approval from OPEC in November to pump even more while other members cut .
The key to continued growth will be attracting foreign investment to the energy industry . `` Iran is definitely better off than they started the year , '' said Carsten Fritsch , an analyst at Commerzbank AG in Frankfurt . `` Further expansion plans for production have reached a plateau . They need foreign investment . ''
While most Persian Gulf nations struggled with lower oil revenue after prices plunged to less than half of their 2014 levels , Iran , with a population about three times larger than Saudi Arabia 's and an economy less dependent on crude , accelerated its growth .
Iran has boosted production this year by 870,000 barrels a day . It pumped 3.67 million barrels a day in November , generating the equivalent of $ 172 million daily based on the average price for Brent crude last month of $ 46.98 a barrel , compared with $ 110 million a day December , 2015 , when Brent averaged $ 39.15 . Iran has risen to become the third-largest producer in OPEC .
`` We need to reach pre-sanctions production levels , '' said Amir Hossein Zamani-Nia , deputy oil minister for international affairs , in October at a conference in Tehran .
The country pumped 4.085 million barrels a day before restrictions were imposed , he pointed out .
Is the political field limited to BJP and Congress despite the numerous regional political parties in India ?
Telangana Chief Minister and Telangana Rashtra Samiti President K. Chandrasekhar Rao ( KCR ) kicked off his mission of bringing the regional parties together to form a non-BJP , non-Congress Third Front with a visit to Kolkata .
KCR , who along with his team of party leaders and advisers flew by chartered aircraft from Hyderabad met the West Bengal Chief Minister and Trinamool Congress President Mamata Banerjee and held a two hour discussions with her on the present political situation .
The visit was significant as Mamata was the first key regional leader to positively respond to KCR 's proposal of floating a Third or a Federal Front and playing a key role at the national level . Soon after KCR had expressed the need for bringing a qualitative change in national politics and coming up with an alternative to the BJP led NDA and Congress led UPA , Mamata had spoken to him over phone . “ We are with you ” , she had told KCR .

Encouraged by her response KCR made Kolkata his first destination on in a nationwide mission during which he plans to visit all the major state capitals including Bengaluru , Bhuvaneshwar , Ranchi , Patna , Mumbai and Lucknow .
KCR who was accompanied by party general secretary K Keshav Rao , his adviser Rajeev Sharma and daughter and MP K Kavita was given a warm welcome at the Kolkata airport by Mamata 's cabinet colleagues . Later Mamata received him outside his office in the state secretariat .
Though the meeting has generated a lot of buzz in the political circles , observers believe that KCR may face a roadblock ahead as Mamata Banerjee was more inclined to be part of a Congress led front while KCR was envisaging a Front sans BJP or Congress .
The Congress was making its own efforts to bring the regional parties together to further strengthen the United Progressive Alliance .
After the meeting KCR told the media that the people of the country were looking forward to an alternative as the BJP and the Congress had failed in meeting the aspirations of the people . “ Today a good beginning has been made towards the formation of a people 's Federal Front ” , he said .
Asserting that the new Front will be based on the “ agenda of development ” KCR said that mere replacing Congress with BJP will not solve any problem . “ There is a need for miracle in this country , something great needs to be done for that . This is a very good beginning in Kolkata . This country needs to change , to reinvent and reorient , for that we have held talks ” , he said .
“ Today 's meeting was the first step towards bringing a qualitative change in country 's politics ” , he said .

When asked about the future tie up between the proposed Federal Front and Congress , KCR said , “ Our front will be a Federal Front . The agenda we are going to propose will be totally different from the present routine model . It will be a peoples agenda , it is not mere Cong , BJP or KCR model ” .
We have discussed the need for the formation of Federal Front and the present political scenario in the country ” , KCR said . “ This will be a people 's Front not parties ' front ” . “ Our Front is very big and we will soon come out with a people 's agenda ” , he added expressing confidence that many friends will come forward to join hands with them .
On the reported differences of opinion with Mamata Banerjee vis-a-vis Congress he said , “ There is some understanding . You will come to know the full details in future because only two of us ca n't decide the whole thing . There are friends , people , like-minded leaders , we need to talk to all of them . We made a good beginning today and I am confident we will be able to carry it forward ” .
Mamata Banerjee said , “ Sometimes people have to come together to work ” .

An urgent appeal has been issued by police after an attempted rape in a Solihull park .
A man , aged 35 , was arrested on Tuesday following the attack - but has been released without charge .
He has been eliminated from police enquiries .
Now , officers need help tracking down the offender following the attack in Babbs Mill Park in Kingshurst last Friday .
The attack happened at some time between 2.30pm and 2.50pm on Friday June 29 as the girl was walking through the park on her way home from school .
( Image : Birmingham Mail )
What happened ?
Police said a man , armed with a knife , knocked the girl to the ground and she suffered a cut to the neck .
She was taken to hospital and has since been discharged and is being supported by specially trained officers .
The offender escaped after the assault and enquiries are underway to try to identify him .
What is the offender 's description ?
He 's described as white , slightly tanned , with short brown/greying hair .
He has blue eyes , large hands and a muscular , stocky build .
The man was with a white King Charles spaniel , which had light brown patches on its ears and body .
The dog had a red collar and red extendable lead .
What else do police know ?
A number of items have already been recovered for forensic testing .
Officers are also also exploring another recent incident to see if it is connected .
Reassurance patrols have been stepped up in the area while investigations continue , and schools and the local authority are being kept informed of developments .
What have police said ?
Chief Inspector Colin Barnes , from Solihull Police , said : “ The man arrested earlier today has been eliminated from our enquiries and we are continuing to appeal for information .
“ While we do have extra patrols in the area and a large number of officers working on the investigation , the role the public plays in these remains crucial .
“ We need the public to be our eyes and ears and to let us know of any piece of information that could help us track down the offender and bring them to justice .
“ As we head towards the school holidays , we want to remind parents and youngsters to follow common sense advice to keep themselves safe .

Thousands of Californians were told Monday to evacuate their homes ahead of a storm that officials said is likely to pummel a region already devastated by wildfires and mudslides .
Robert Lewin , the Santa Barbara County emergency management director , said the area is expecting more rainfall in a single storm than the county typically sees all year .
“ Ten inches of rain falling on a burn area is something that we do n't understand exactly what 's going to happen , ” he said during a news conference .

An `` atmospheric river '' is expected to arrive on Tuesday and last until Thursday , officials said , bringing heavy rain and possible flash flooding , along with tumbling rock and mudslides from San Luis Obispo County south to Los Angeles .
Mark Jackson , a meteorologist with the National Weather Service , said the storm 's bulls-eye will be an area scorched last year by a wildfire that was the largest in California history , at 440 square miles .
Eighteen people were killed and 1,000 buildings — many of them homes — were reduced to ashes .

In January , with the blaze still simmering , a powerful storm swept across Santa Barbara and Ventura Counties , triggering mudslides that killed 21 people .
With mountain channels cleared out by the January storm , Jackson expects rocks and soil to cascade toward the coast with even more ease than they did two months ago .
Lewin concurred . “ Those mountains are locked and loaded with debris , ” he said .
Mandatory evacuation orders will go into effect on Tuesday in Santa Barbara County , clearing 7,400 residents out of their homes , or roughly 17,000 to 18,000 people , Sheriff Bill Brown said .
“ This storm is not the storm to question , ” Lewin said . “ Please heed the mandatory evacuation orders . ”
Standing in the dappled shade of a driveway hundreds of miles from Charlottesville , Va. , Mark Heyer spoke of the violence that claimed his daughter 's life — and , with voice occasionally quavering , called on people to answer hate with forgiveness .
`` My daughter was a strong woman that had passionate opinions about the equality of everyone — and she tried to stand up for that , '' the Sharpes , Fla. , resident told Florida Today in a videotaped interview . `` With her , it was n't lip service . It was real . ''
Just two days earlier , a driver rammed a car into a group of people protesting a white supremacist rally , killing Heyer 's daughter Heather , 32 , and wounding 19 other people . Federal authorities have opened a civil rights investigation into the attack , saying `` such actions arise from racial bigotry and hatred . ''
The man allegedly behind the wheel , James Alex Fields Jr. , had long harbored sympathies for Nazi ideas , according to a former teacher . Fields has been charged with one count of second-degree murder , three counts of malicious wounding and one count of hit-and-run .
But the hatred espoused by white supremacists and others in Charlottesville this weekend must not be met with a response that 's `` twisted into something negative '' in its own right , Mark Heyer told the local newspaper .
`` People need to stop hating , and they need to forgive each other . And I include myself in that , in forgiving the guy that did this , '' he said . `` He does n't know any better . You know , I just think of what the Lord said on the cross . Lord forgive him , they do n't know what they 're doing . ''
In this respect , he said he aspires to follow his daughter 's example .
`` You know , my daughter 's life — she 's ... '' he paused , searching for words . `` I 'm proud of her for standing up . She had more courage than I did . She had more courage than I did . She had a stubborn backbone . She thought she was right . She would stand there and defy you .
`` But if I understand her , '' he added , `` she wanted to do it peacefully and with a fierceness of heart that comes with her conviction . ''
In interviews with multiple media outlets over the weekend , Heather 's mother , Susan Bro , also praised the way her daughter balanced peaceful efforts with a `` very strong sense of right and wrong . ''
`` It was important to her to speak up for people that she felt were not being heard , to speak up when injustices were happening , '' Bro said , `` and she saw in the lives of many of her African-American friends particularly and her gay friends that equal rights were not being given . ''
One day after the violent gathering that saw protesters and counterprotesters punching and kicking one another — and later saw Heather Heyer killed , along with two state troopers whose helicopter crashed — peaceful protests took shape in cities across the U.S . In Seattle and New York City , Atlanta and in Grand Rapids , Mich. , demonstrators sought to respond to the message promulgated in Charlottesville and , in the words of one protester , `` resist it fearlessly . ''
`` I hope that her life and what has transpired changes people 's hearts , '' Mark Heyer said . `` You can fight all you want and fuss and cuss and do all that stuff , but when you take your last breath , it 's over . It 's done !
`` You 're going to take away what a person has and everything else they 're going to have . There is no more — not here , you know , '' he added . `` And that 's — that 's pretty much all I got , brother . ''
Glanbia investors have been urged to abstain from voting to reappoint a number of directors at the company 's annual general meeting , which takes place in Kilkenny on Wednesday .
Shareholder advisory group , Institutional Shareholder Services ( ISS ) , said Glanbia Co-op Society , the company 's largest shareholder , had a disproportionate representation on the board of the plc .
Currently 10 of the 14 non-executive directors on Glanbia 's board are co-op nominees .
As a result , ISS recommended that shareholders abstain from the the election and re-election of eight directors – Eamon Power , Patrick Murphy , John Murphy , Martin Keane , Brendan Hayes , Tom Grant , Vincent Gorman and Patsy Ahern .
All eight are members of the Glanbia Co-op , which holds a 31.5 per cent stake in the group .
ISS said while the board continues to undergo changes in relation to Glanbia Co-op members , “ there is still a significant number of society nominees on the board particularly given the society 's stake has dropped to 31.5 percent ” .
“ An abstention on the re-election of the society representatives is considered warranted to reflect that more needs to be done to address the board balance , ” it said .
Glanbia declined to comment on the ISS note . However , it has previously stated it plans to reduce Co-op representation on the board of the plc from 10 to eight this year and to six by 2022 .
Glanbia sold off a controlling stake in its dairy business to Glanbia co-op last year .
The deal saw Glanbia 's consumer foods and agribusiness units hived off into a new group , known as Glanbia Ireland , which is now jointly controlled by Glanbia plc and the co-op .
The co-op is understood to amassed close to €70 million from the spin-out of co-op shares in the plc .

SACRAMENTO — The news caught Jordan Bell by surprise the same way it did for everyone else . The Warriors acquired former New Orleans Pelicans center DeMarcus Cousins with their taxpayer mid-level exception ( $ 5.3 million ) , providing the very piece the team needed to keep its championship train moving and the ammunition all 29 other teams needed to further fuel their resentment .
“ I was very shocked , ” Bell said following the Warriors ' summer-league win over the Sacramento Kings on Tuesday .
Before Bell could think of what that meant , he could not help but think of something else .
“ First thing I thought about was him and [ Kevin Durant ] getting into it , ” Bell said , smiling .
Cousins and Durant sure got into it .

In the Warriors ' 125-115 victory over New Orleans on Dec. 4 , 2017 , Durant and Cousins both received ejections with 1:14 left in the fourth quarter after jawing at each other . After they were tossed , Durant approached Cousins before Draymond Green and Andre Iguodala intervened . It did not stop there . Cousins tried to enter the Warriors ' locker room , prompting team security officials to stop him in the hallway . Therefore , Bell found it “ definitely funny ” that Durant and Green posted photos of that incident with good humor on their Instagram stories .

Green and Durant then connected each other on Facetime following the Warriors ' summer-league win over Miami on Monday . After Durant chided Bell for missing a dunk after throwing the ball off the backboard , Bell brought up Durant 's previous scuffle with Cousins .
“ Are y'all go to get along ? ” Bell recalled asking .
“ ‘ Yeah , that was just us competing on the floor , ' ” Durant answered . “ ‘ You forget about it the next day . ' ”

The Warriors surely will tease Cousins about that incident . But it does not sound like they need to worry that Cousins now can enter the Warriors ' locker room . After all , Durant and Green were among the players that vouched for Cousins after averaging 25.2 points , 12.9 rebounds and 5.4 assists , while shooting 47 percent from the field and 35.4 percent from 3-point range . Even if Cousins faces uncertainty with his pending return from a left Achilles tendon injury , the Warriors believe they will benefit with having any version of him .
“ He 's obviously great and a great All-Star , ” Bell said . “ I 'm very excited for him to be on the team . He can help us out a lot being that scoring center . He is definitely a tough person to guard . Big body , can shoot and can do just about anything . ”
Bell sounded just as giddy when a reporter informed him that the Warriors agreed to re-sign fourth-year forward Kevon Looney to a one-year deal on the veteran 's minimum . That sets up a Warriors frontcourt that will feature Cousins , Looney , Bell and third-year center Damian Jones . With Zaza Pachulia and David West unlikely to return and JaVale McGee accepting a one-year deal with the Los Angeles Lakers , the Warriors quickly upgraded at that spot .
“ It 's going to be like last year . Kevon and Damian will have a bigger role this year , if we do n't get Zaza or David West back , ” Bell said . “ But I thought Kevon showed up great last year , especially in the playoffs guarding and did a great job of that . I 'm happy to have him back . ”

Austin Gleeson ruling will be cruicial
The outcome of the All-Ireland hurling final wo n't be decided this week but the CCCC ruling on Austin Gleeson will play a crucial bearing either way . If the Mount Sion man does n't get to play , it would not only be an incalculable personal and family disappointment , it will rob Waterford of a talismanic figure .
Waterford had several splendid performers in Sunday 's hard-headed win over Cork but consider the luminosity of Gleeson 's achievement in just one five minute spell . The game had been level on eight occasions when the sending-off of Cork 's Damien Cahalane gave Waterford numerical advantage . Gleeson got the next score for Waterford , a long-range point in the 53rd minute . Four minutes later , Cork were still well in the hunt with a 0-18 to 1-13 lead when Gleeson chased down Cork 's Christopher Joyce , who was seeking to clear the ball .
Joyce turned and looked to outpace Gleeson but had the ball robbed with a neat flick and by the time he recovered , Gleeson had the ball in his hand and was already beginning his flat , squared pass across the Cork goal to where Jamie Barron was waiting . Goal .
Then , in the 59th minute , Gleeson actually dropped an elementary hand-pass and wrong-footed two Cork defenders with the speed of his recovery . By then , he was on his way to scoring the famous weaving goal which secured Waterford 's passage to a first All-Ireland final since 2008 .
All of that in five minutes : 2-1 created out of nothing particularly special . The replays of the incident in which Gleeson appears to pull Luke Meade 's helmet off his head will be scrutinised by all interested parties in the coming days . Maybe it can be successfully argued that the Waterford player was looking at the ball rather than his opponent during his seconds and maybe the fact that ball had gone dead can be entered as a mitigating factor .

But the next few days will be nerve-wracking for Gleeson and Waterford . Trying to win an All-Ireland final is difficult enough with the reigning Hurler of the Year in your ranks . Trying to achieve that with him as a reluctant spectator is an entirely different level of difficulty .
If the bookmakers ' judgment is to be trusted , Waterford hopes could soar : they are offering odds of 1 / 2 of Gleeson being available for the final and 6/4 of him missing out through suspension .
Waterford and Fives show the system works
The ‘ system ' works . Waterford made light of the absence of Tadhg De Búrca , unavailable for Sunday 's semi-final after receiving a straight red card for pulling at Harry Kehoe 's face guard .
Derek McGrath 's improvisation of an extra-defender , playing a covering or sweeping role , has had its share of criticism . But even without de Búrca , whose understanding of the sweeper 's role has been central to Waterford 's resurgence under McGrath , the team purred on Sunday .
McGrath said before the match that de Búrca 's absence would be critical and had his number five printed on his hand for Sunday 's match . And Waterford did n't blink and Darragh Fives was so accomplished in the loose defensive role on Sunday that he has almost left McGrath with a dilemma .

It was clear that Waterford 's players know and trust the system and feel comfortable in it and their final score of 4-19 was the ultimate retort to the complaint that their defensive caution makes them a blunted attacking force .
Hurling keeps on reimagining itself
At the beginning of this year 's championship , Tipperary , Waterford , Kilkenny , Galway and Clare were the chief subjects of debate in likely All-Ireland winners .
Then Davy Fitzgerald and Wexford hijacked the competition through a combination of colour and talent . Then Kieran Kingston 's young Cork team were suddenly aflame and hurling with a confidence and self-expressiveness which delighted not just the Rebel county but custodians of hurling everywhere .
Kilkenny fell in July- a story in itself . Galway and Tipp played out the latest instalment of a rivalry that has all of the quality of the 1980s version but none of the rancour . And now the old game is left with Waterford or Galway for the big honour .
Apart from the fall of the house of Offaly , it has all been good news and future summers seem rich with possibility .
We use the word “ happy ” daily . We wish someone a “ happy birthday ” or tell someone we are “ happy to see you. ” The word is very basic yet hard to define . Happiness can mean different things to different people , including “ joy , ” “ contentment ” and “ inner peace. ” However it is defined , research is showing that it 's rather elusive in our society .
As a culture we are so focused on being productive and efficient , that we may have lost the ability to simply be happy . Being happy may be seen as the opposite of being productive and efficient . People will report feeling guilty if they are “ too happy ” or feeling as though they need to “ earn the right to be happy with hard work . ”
Happiness is not only a mood state , but affects on many aspects of our health and overall sense of well-being . Research shows that immune functioning , energy level , and mental and physical health are all linked to happiness . There is even mounting evidence that happy people may live longer than people who are less happy . A study of 180 nuns in the United Sates found that those who rated themselves as happy lived on average nine years longer than those nuns who rated themselves s less happy .
Some may think of happiness as a trait that is determined by circumstances . However , research has shown that only 10 percent of happiness is due to factors such as finances , housing and job availability . In fact , 50 percent of our happiness is influenced by genetics and a substantial 40 percent of our happiness is the result of our thinking and behavior . This research suggests that even if we do n't have a genetic makeup that predisposes us to happiness , we can exert a significant amount of influence to make ourselves happy through our thinking and behaviors .
Certain cultures appear to be happier than others . Even though the United States is a world superpower , it only ranks 11th on this list of the Happiest Places on Earth compiled by the Untied Nations in 2012 . According to the ranking , the happiest places on earth are Denmark , Finland , Norway , the Netherlands and Canada . These countries in the top five share a cold climate , free universal health-care coverage and generous maternity leave . It may also be that the top-ranked nations have an outlook that is consistent with what the experts suggest encourages happiness .
Research has shown that a worldview that maintains a focus on novelty , curiosity and the present leads to happiness . In addition , a lifestyle that encourages physical activity and encourages social contacts increases happiness . Moreover , new research shows that happy people do not shy away from taking risks and engage in activities that may initially cause them some discomfort in an effort to reach a higher goal .
Consider the following ideas to bring more happiness in to your life :
» Bring novelty to daily experiences . Instead of having the same breakfast , walking the same route or reading the same newspaper , make a small change .
» Challenge yourself . Research has shown that happiness is created when we select a goal or an activity that pushes us slightly out of our comfort zone .
» Savor small daily experiences . Focus on the taste of a food , the smell of flowers or the sounds of music .
» Focus on the here and now . Stop focusing on the past or the future and be fully present in the moment .
» Look at the world as a child would . Think about your surroundings as being new and interesting . As you drive look for the variety of shades of green in the foliage or examine the variety of sounds you hear on a walk .
» Slow down . Instead of racing to check off a list of must-do 's , consider if all the items really must get done ?
» Choose to be happy . Being happy can be a conscious choice . Seek out activities and people who make you feel good .
» Activity is good . Regular activity can be almost as effective as medication in warding off depression .
» Take care of yourself . Focus on sleeping and eating well .
» Act as if you are happy . Making eye contact and smiling at others as though you were happy will cause others to respond in a positive manner .
Wishing you a happy day !

This is the horrifying moment a knife-wielding thug stormed a Walsall off-licence - assaulting a terrified shop assistant and snatching cigarettes and cash .
The thief and his accomplice escaped with thousands of pounds after smashing open the till in the June 24 raid on Booze Land .
Now police have launched an appeal to trace the pair , who struck at the Bloxwich Road shop at around 10.30pm .
CCTV captured the moment the masked raider - dressed in a cap and grey t-shirt and wielding what appears to be an eight-inch kitchen knife - rushed into the store .
He storms behind the counter and can be seen leaning over the panicked shop assistant , while waving a knife above her head .
He makes a grab for packs of cigarettes and uses his knife to force open the till , while his accomplice keeps watch at the door .
The woman , who was working alone in the shop at the time of the raid , was threatened with the knife and assaulted .
She did not sustain any serious injuries .
A 51-year-old man has been arrested in connection with the incident and released under investigation .

One in four West Midlands secondary schools went over budget last year .
The study , published by the Education Policy Institute ( EPI ) , means they spent more than they received in funding .
And campaigners said schools will be forced to cut staff as they struggle to balance the books .
Geoff Barton , general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders , said : “ Staffing cuts are not just likely in the future , as the EPI report suggests , but have already taken place in many schools .
A study of school balance sheets shows that 24.6 per cent of West Midlands secondary schools , very nearly a quarter , ran up deficits in the 2016-17 financial year .
This was up from 11.9 per cent in the previous year .
It also found that 7.1 per cent of West Midlands primary schools , one in 14 , went over budget .
That figure was up from 3.9 per cent the previous year .
The National Audit Office , an independent spending watchdog , last year warned that schools across the country needed to make savings of £3 billion to balance the books .
The Department for Education insists that schools have more money than ever before .
However , headteachers say that their costs have increased by even more .
David Laws , EPI executive chairman and former Lib Dem schools minister , said : “ This analysis highlights the nature and scale of cost pressures facing England 's schools .
`` After 15 years in which school funding has either been growing healthily or has at least been protected from inflationary pressures , school budgets are clearly now being squeezed .
“ This is evident from the sharp rise in the number and proportion of local authority schools which are in budget deficit . The trebling of the proportion of maintained secondary schools over recent years is particularly striking .
“ Many schools will need to find savings and it will not be easy to do this without reducing staff numbers .
`` Schools and the Education Department will need to work hard to ensure that reduced staff numbers do not impact on education standards . ”
Geoff Barton , general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders , said : “ This report shows that many schools are so cash-strapped they are unable to afford even a meagre pay rise of 1 % for their staff next year without having to make further cuts .
“ The Government has failed to provide schools with funding for pay awards over the course of several years , and this is one of a series of additional cost pressures which have pushed school finances to breaking point .
`` Staffing cuts are not just likely in the future , as the EPI report suggests , but have already taken place in many schools .
“ If the Government values education , it must put its money where its mouth is and provide schools with the funding they need to give all of our young people the very best start in life , and it must fully fund decent pay awards for school staff after years of austerity . ”
A Department for Education spokesman said : “ We do not recognise these findings . The fact is , thanks to our reforms and the hard work of teachers , standards are rising in our schools .
“ By 2020 , core school funding will rise to a record £43.5 billion - the IFS ( Institute for Fiscal Studies ) has confirmed that by then per pupil funding will have increased more than 70 % since 1990 .
“ Latest figures show schools hold surpluses of more than £4 billion and we are providing support to help them get the most out of every pound they spend . ”
Separate figures last week showed that Birmingham needs nearly 12,000 extra school places by September 2021 , with 5,000 potentially needed by this September .
Figures released by the Department for Education show that , based on school capacity surveys as at May 2017 , the local authority needs an estimated 4,689 extra school places by this September , and 11,918 extra by September 2021 .
Across the West Midlands combined authority area , 18,479 extra school places are needed by September 2021 , with 7,409 needed by September .
Michael Flynn
WASHINGTON : White House national security adviser Michael Flynn is under increasing political pressure and risks losing the confidence of some colleagues following reports that he misled senior administration officials about his discussion of sanctions with a Russian envoy shortly before President Trump took office .
As White House aides scramble to get their stories straight about the exact nature of those communications and as Democrats call for Flynn 's security clearance to be suspended or revoked , neither Trump nor his advisers have publicly defended Flynn or signalled that he has the president 's confidence .
Privately , some administration officials said that Flynn 's position has weakened and support for him has eroded largely because of a belief that he was disingenuous about Russia and therefore could not be fully trusted going forward .
“ The knives are out for Flynn , ” said one administration official who , like others interviewed for this report , spoke on the condition of anonymity in order to speak candidly .
On Sunday , the top White House aide dispatched to represent the administration on the political talk shows pointedly declined to defend Flynn .
Asked on NBC 's “ Meet the Press ” whether the president had confidence in Flynn , senior policy adviser Stephen Miller said he did not know .
“ It 's not for me to tell you what 's in the president 's mind , ” Miller told moderator Chuck Todd . He added that his colleagues at the White House “ did not give me anything to say ” about Flynn .
When ABC News anchor George Stephanopoulos asked Miller about Flynn 's interactions with Sergey Kislyak , Russia 's ambassador to the United States , Miller said , “ I do n't have any news to make ... today on this point . ”
The Washington Post revealed last week that Flynn and Kislyak had discussed US sanctions against Russia in the month before Trump 's inauguration .
The Post 's finding , confirmed by nine current and former US officials , contrasted with the assurances made publicly by Vice President Pence and other top administration officials that Flynn never talked about sanctions with Russian officials .
Based on Flynn 's private assurances , Pence , White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and White House press secretary Sean Spicer stated publicly that Flynn never discussed sanctions with Kislyak .
Pence spoke to Flynn twice on Friday — once face to face and by telephone , according to an administration official who declined to characterise the contents of those discussions .
“ Flynn is running out of friends , no question , ” a different administration official said . “ The broad consensus in the White House is that he lied . The vice president feels like he lied . In a position that needs to be no drama , it 's non-stop drama . I would be very surprised if he lasts much longer . ”
New Jersey Gov . Chris Christie , R , an informal adviser to Trump , called on Flynn to “ clear up ” what happened with Trump and Pence , but he stopped short of accusing him of wrongdoing .
“ I think that 's the obligation of General Flynn , his national security adviser , to have those type of candid conversations with the president and the vice president , ” Christie said on CNN . “ And then they will act as they see fit , given all the circumstances . ”
Over the weekend at Trump 's Mar-a-Lago Club in Palm Beach , Florida , the president privately voiced frustration with Flynn and the political baggage he is hanging on the White House , according to two people familiar with his comments .
Spicer denied that Trump criticised Flynn to anyone at the club and called assertions to the contrary “ fake news . ”
People close to Flynn said he feels confident in his position despite the swirling controversy . He flew to Florida this weekend with the president along with other National Security Council officials to engage with his Japanese counterparts during Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe 's visit .
Furthermore , people in Trump 's orbit cautioned that it would not be in the president 's nature to fire Flynn because doing so would amount to an admission of guilt and misjudgement in the face of media scrutiny , as well as demonstrate chaos in the early weeks of his presidency .
The doubts about the national security adviser come as Trump faces his first significant provocation from a US adversary overseas . North Korea fired a ballistic missile over the weekend , a move suspected by some experts as designed to serve as a test of components of an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of reaching the United States .
Trump responded on Saturday night in a joint appearance with Abe at Mar-a-Lago , where he reassured his Japanese counterpart that the United States fully supported Japan .
Flynn , a retired lieutenant general and a decorated intelligence officer , met Trump in late 2015 to offer advice about his campaign and signed on with Trump the following year . He won Trump 's approval during the general election with his willingness to travel regularly and deliver fiery stump speeches trashing Trump 's Democratic opponent , Hillary Clinton .
Democratic leaders have called for investigations into the Flynn 's contact with Russian officials and for Trump to suspend and revoke Flynn 's security clearance .
“ President Trump 's kowtowing to Vladimir Putin is endangering our national security and emboldening a dangerous tyrant , ” House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi , D-Calif. , said Saturday .
Rep. Elijah Cummings , Md. , the top Democrat on the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform , said Sunday on ABC News that suspending Flynn 's clearance would be “ an appropriate action . ”
Trump has not yet issued a comment about Flynn , either on Twitter or in one of his brief appearances before journalists over the weekend . Aboard Air Force One on Friday , reporters asked Trump about The Post 's report on Flynn 's discussion of sanctions and the president claimed he did not know about it , even though it had by then become a major story across cable news .
“ I do n't know about that . I have n't seen it , ” Trump said during a flight to Florida from Washington . “ What report is that ? I have n't seen that . I 'll look into that . ”

Days later and fans of Beyoncé are still discussing her losing Album of the Year at the 59th annual Grammy Awards , including her sister . Solange Knowles took to her Twitter account to voice her displeasure with her older sister losing AOTY and with the Grammys in general , despite winning her first Grammy during Sunday night 's show for her album A Seat at the Table .
Many notable artists have been very vocal throughout the years about the racism , discrimination and out-of-touch ideals that seem to plague the Grammys , with the most vocal being the 21-time Grammy-winning Kanye West . West let his opinion be known numerous times , but this year other artists publicly echoed his sentiments , including Frank Ocean , who wrote a scathing post on Tumblr , and most recently Solange Knowles .
After Adele decided to use her AOTY acceptance speech as a chance praise Beyoncé , complete with breaking her award in half as a gesture to share it , many Beyoncé fans voiced their disappointment on social media , Solange included .
In a series of tweets that have since been deleted , Solange took the time to not only acknowledge her sister 's loss , but also offer an awards alternative :
“ There have only been two black winners in the last 20 years for Album of the Year . There have been over 200 black artists who have performed . Create your own committees , build your own institutions , give your friends awards , award yourself , and be the gold you wan na hold my g 's . ”

A man who is suspected of threatening a Las Vegas Church and saluted mass shooters pleaded guilty to charges Thursday .
Court records showed Calin Hodges accepted a guilty plea agreement citing mental illness to making threats or conveying false information concerning acts of terrorism .
According to an arrest report , Las Vegas Metro officers were dispatched to Mountain Top Faith Ministries near Sahara Avenue and Jones Boulevard on Feb. 21 after a church member said Hodges stated he was going to commit a mass shooting at the church . Prior to his arrest , the member of the church approached Hodges and offered him help because he appeared disheveled . Hodges said he did not need anything and he was `` planning something big '' and claimed he was going to be the `` greatest mass shooter in history . '' Hodges referenced 1 October mass shooter , Stephen Paddock and said he `` completely identifies with every mass shooter . ''

Prosecutors said Hodges had a diary in his car that said : `` Paddock stole my idea on 1 October . ''
A district court spokesperson said Hodges faces one to six years behind bars . He is scheduled to be sentenced on June 27 .

A JUDGE in the trial of a man accused of murdering a father-of-one who had allegedly been hounding him over an unpaid debt for designer clothes has sent the jury home for the weekend .
Haroon Rafiq , 24 , is accused of repeatedly knifing Sajad Hussain and slashing his throat in a “ barbaric ” attack after they met on August 6 last year .
Judge Philip Parker QC will continue his summing up on Monday after giving the jury legal instructions .
Rafiq said in evidence that he was being threatened with kidnap and violence by Mr Hussain over a bill of more than £44,000 for clothes he had been pressurised to take .
The prosecution say his evidence in court differed markedly from police statements and he took calculating steps to carry out the murder and dispose evidence , including throwing the weapon and his jacket in a river afterwards .
( Image : PA )
Both sides accept Rafiq inflicted the fatal knife wounds on the 40-year-old in Tenby Road , Moseley , where the men were neighbours .
Judge Parker told the jury it would need to weigh up a count of murder against a lesser charge of manslaughter , with no option of a not guilty verdict .
Rafiq , wearing a grey Hugo Boss top , listened attentively in a glass dock as the trial neared its conclusion at Birmingham Crown Court on Friday .
John Butterfield , for the prosecution , said in his closing speech : “ He and no one else committed these acts .
`` The acts themselves were simply barbaric and speak loud and clear of an intention to kill .
`` The sole defence he seeks to run is one of loss of control and yet time and time again so many aspects of what happened that night were the clearest examples of him having retained control .
`` Elements are worked through , elements he conceived of and carried out and , one might say , planned and executed . I 'm afraid to say there 's a sad irony about that last word .
`` They are really obvious hallmarks of a man who is wholly , wholly in control of what he was doing . ”
Mr Butterfield referred to aspects of Rafiq 's story that did not appear in his police interviews , which included evidence he gave in court that the debt and alleged intimidation had made him feel suicidal , but that he felt too ashamed to tell his family about the matter .
Mr Butterfield told the jury : “ What he was saying repeatedly made no sense .
“ How could it possibly be in his police interviews he gave graphic accounts of slitting a man 's throat but he was shy or abashed of saying even once that he had suicidal thoughts ?
Mr Butterfield said transcripts of phone conversations , recorded by Mr Hussain , showed no evidence of threats and intimidation .
David Mason , defending , told the jury his client was of previous good character but suggested he had “ flipped ” under mounting pressure .
Mr Mason said : “ What 's driven such a man to arm himself with a knife , a lethal weapon , and go into the streets of our city and brutally take the life of another man in this way ? ”
Rafiq had told of being threatened by Mr Hussain over a debt of more than £44,000 , and paying off £7,000 after receiving clothes on seven or eight occasions .
Mr Mason said : “ We would suggest what he says about being pressurised , ripped off , extorted , has some validity when you look at the documents we have here .
“ This man of limited means appears to have been fighting a never-ending battle . ”
( Image : Birmingham Mail )
Mr Mason also referred to evidence showing financial pressures on Rafiq , who had said he was unemployed after leaving his warehouse job due to arthritis two months before the incident .
Mr Mason said : “ Something utterly horrendous must have been going on in that man 's life to make him do what he did that night .
`` Something so terrible that he lost it , flipped , had enough , and it 's clear , we would say , that he 's regretted it every single day .
`` That 's why he handed himself in and made the confessions that he did to the police . But all of that does n't make him a murderer . ”
The case continues .
A Mountain Village man is accused of barricading himself in his home with a shotgun and then killing his girlfriend .
On Wednesday night , Alexie Walters , age 34 , allegedly assaulted several community members , then retreated to his home . The State Troopers ' report says that Walters barricaded himself inside with his 22-year-old girlfriend , Gertrude Queenie , and then continued to assault her . When two Village Police Officers approached the house , Walters came to the door with his shotgun and fired . The officers fled the scene .
Troopers stationed in St. Mary 's arrived in the village at about 12:30 a.m . They tried to talk to Walters , but there was no response . About two hours later , Walters bolted from his house and disappeared . A Village Police Officer entered the home to look for Queenie and found her body .
A search for Walters continued until he turned himself in at the Mountain Village Public Safety Building that afternoon . “ From the city of Mountain Village , we 'd like to send our sincere condolences to the family and people involved , ” said Mountain Village City Manager Michelle Peterson in a statement issued Friday . “ We pray that the families can find peace and comfort in this time . ”
Walters has a string of prior convictions that include rape , the sexual abuse of a minor , and several counts of assault . He is now in custody and charged with murder in the second degree , two counts of assault in the third degree , assault in the fourth degree , and tampering with evidence . Queenie 's body will be sent to the State Medical Examiner 's office in Anchorage for an autopsy .
There is a hearing on Walters ' case scheduled for October 16 in Aniak .

For combating these challenges , cost-effective and complementary therapies are required . Diabetes has now been classified as a vascular disease and the cost of treating and controlling the micro-vascular component is a serious problem , specifically in developing countries . Niacinamide or nicotinamide is an essential vitamin and also an essential constituent of co-enzymes found in the mammalian systems . Nicotinamide is a member of the vitamin B complex . It is generally soluble in water .
Read Report Overview @ https : //www.transparencymarketresearch.com/nicotinamide-market.html
Deficiency of nicotinamide can be initially observed with symptoms such as weakness , indigestion , lassitude , anorexia , and irritability , which can lead to diarrhea and dementia . The chemical name of nicotinamide is 3-pyridinecarboxamide . It can be directly synthetized by the human body . In human body , nicotinamide is easily absorbed by the gastro-intestinal ( GI ) tract . Major dietary sources of nicotinamide are meat , milk , and grains . Physically , nicotinamide is a solid powder with water solubility of 691–1000 grams/liter and vapor pressure of 31.4 hPa at room temperature .
Nicotinamide is a highly important ingredient used in food products to enhance their nutritional value . It is extensively used in bakery products , cereals , and beverages . It is also a type of dietary supplement . It is incorporated in supplements such as tablets and capsules . Nicotinamide is employed in cosmetics as a hair- and skin-conditioning agent .

HAMILTON — Liberal Premier Kathleen Wynne travelled to the heart of her NDP rival 's riding today to portray herself as the only seasoned elder stateswoman in the province 's election campaign .
Wynne played up her credentials outside a Stelco steel plant in Hamilton .
As premier , she said , she had met leaders both in Canada and the United States amid threats by U.S. President Donald Trump to impose tariffs on Canadian steel .
Wynne criticized NDP Leader Andrea Horwath as too left on the political spectrum , and her Tory rival Doug Ford as too right to deal with such situations effectively .
SWIMMING FUN : Matthew Owens , Jashari McIntosh , Charlotte Stevens and Luciana Favero , all aged 6 , splash away at their afternoon swimming lesson at WIRAC .
MORE than 30 % of Australian parents are not taking children under five to swimming lessons .
That 's why WIRAC has thrown its support behind a community safety initiative to prevent childhood drownings by offering free swimming lessons for kids under five during national Learn2Swim Week next month .
Warwick parents can access free swimming lessons at WIRAC for their kids by signing up at learn2swimweek.com .
WIRAC co-ordinator Karen Peters said swimming was an essential life skill for all Australian children .
`` What we 've chosen to do is open it up to kids from four to 12 years old and have it as one free lesson during a week of intensive lessons in the school holidays , ” Mrs Peters said .
`` It 's important younger kids do get that early experience with swimming .
`` We have afternoon sessions even during the winter where our pools are heated and a lot of parents do have their kids enrolled , but we would like to see more .
`` We hope by making one lesson free during the week of September 25 to 29 that will encourage more parents to sign their kids up . ”
Mrs Peters said without learning to swim at a young age , Australian kids are at a greater risk of drowning .
`` We see a lot of kids , if they have n't had that early experience , they 'll come to school swimming not knowing how to swim at all , ” she said .
`` There 's a week or two of swimming in school but that 's not good enough .
`` Even around Warwick , there are dams on farms or the river .
`` We hope parents see the value in teaching their kids to swim . ”
Richard Beatiie from Poolwerx , the company behind the Learn2Swim initiative , said the program was a great way to have children learning vital water safety skills .
`` Drowning is still the leading cause of preventable deaths in children under five in Australia , ” Mr Beatiie said .
Now in its fourth year , Learn2Swim Week runs from September 23 to October 2 .

For small Croydon exporter to Gulf , Brexit is already biting
Image copyright AFP/Getty Image caption The black unemployment rate has declined but disparities remain
The unemployment rate for US black workers jumped to 7.7 % last month , reversing course after falling to a record low in December .
The new figures were a potentially awkward turn of events for President Donald Trump , who has bragged repeatedly about the decline .
Even before the latest data , however , critics have said the president 's celebration was premature , pointing to the persistent gap between black and white unemployment rates .
Job gains in 2017 pushed the black unemployment rate down in December to 6.8 % .
While that was the lowest rate since the US started tracking the figure in 1972 , it remained by far the highest of racial groups .
Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Members of the Congressional Black Caucus during President Trump 's State of the Union speech did not clap when he mentioned the unemployment rate
The national unemployment rate has fallen 60 % since 2009 to 4.1 % - a level not seen since the start of the century .
The white unemployment rate was 3.7 % in December , while it hovered at 2.5 % for Asians and at 4.9 % for Hispanic and Latinos .
`` The decline has occurred in the unemployment rates for everyone , '' says William Darity , a public policy professor at Duke University . `` That 's the big problem I have using this as some kind of signal of an event to be celebrated . ''
Can Trump claim credit for the decline ?
Economists say slow and steady growth since the end of the recession is responsible for the job gains , much of which pre-date the Trump administration .
In 2017 , Mr Trump 's first year in office , the black unemployment rate fell by about 1 % .
That is roughly on par with the annual pace of improvement during the final two years of the Barack Obama administration .
Image copyright AFP/Getty Image caption US President Donald Trump promotes his economic policies at the World Economic Forum
The president has touted deregulation and corporate tax cuts as lifting business confidence and spurring hiring .
But US Department of Labor figures show total job gains actually slowed under President Trump . Last year , employers added about 2.1m jobs - the smallest number since 2010 .
`` There is certainly a genuine decline [ in the unemployment rate ] , but I would argue that it has little to do with him , '' says Lisa Cook , an economics professor at Michigan State University .
`` It has to do with a recovering economy and that did n't start start in January 2017 . ''
The January rate of 7.7 % among black workers was the highest since April . ( The unemployment rate for white workers , however , edged lower to 3.5 % . )
Some degree of monthly variation is expected , but last month 's rise is large enough to suggest the downward trend might be over , says William Spriggs , an economics professor at Howard University and chief economist at the AFL-CIO labour union .
`` I would be concerned that January is n't just the normal fluctuation , '' he says .
Is the gap between blacks and whites narrowing ?
The black unemployment rate has been roughly double that of the white rate for decades .
While that has narrowed periodically - including in the last few years - the figures can be hard to parse .
The smaller gap is not evident , for example , if the black unemployment rate is compared to that of only non-Hispanic whites .
By other measures , serious disparities persist .
White families in the US typically have about seven times the wealth of black families , according to the 2016 Survey of Consumer Finances , an annual report from the US Federal Reserve .
White households are also significantly more likely to own a home and car , and have retirement accounts or other investments .
If the job gains of recent years were to continue , those differences could start to diminish , says Mr Spriggs .
But the pace of job creation is slowing . And meanwhile , `` those gaps are huge '' .
President Trump 's focus solely on the decline is perceived as a `` lack of recognition '' that the disparities remain a problem , says Hilary Shelton , a senior vice president for policy and advocacy at the NAACP civil rights organisation .
He adds that the president 's policies compound those concerns .
`` We have not heard any discussion about what he hopes to do to specifically address the disparity that has been rather consistent , '' he says .
How much of this is due to racism ?
The racial gap in unemployment rates has persisted even though today 's black workforce is better educated and has more skills than it had in previous decades , says Mr Spriggs .
He says that is why `` it convinces me that I really am looking at discrimination '' .
Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The president has faulted black athletes for protesting during the national anthem
In that light , economists say the president 's record of racially charged remarks - such as blaming `` both sides '' for violence after a white supremacist rally in Virginia last year - is troubling .
`` People , firms are following the president 's lead and it 's open season for discrimination , '' says Ms Cook .
In an interview with CNN , the rapper Jay-Z said the president 's celebration of the black unemployment rate was `` missing the whole point '' .
`` It 's not about money at the end of the day , '' he said . `` You 're missing the whole point . You treat people like human beings . ''
Are there any signs of progress ?
The percentage of the working age black population that is employed has also nearly rebounded since the recession to almost 58 % .
Though the level remains lower than the previous record and lower than the roughly 60 % for whites , the gap between the two races is smaller than it once was .
The narrowing comes as the share of the US working age population that is employed has fallen dramatically for all races , with an especially sharp drop occurring during the recession .
The decline , still not fully understood , has been explained by a mix of factors , including opioid addiction , automation and early retirements after job losses during the recession .
The white population is aging more quickly than the black population , which may explain part of the recent convergence .
The rebound among black workers also suggests they are less deterred by the low wages that have characterised many of the new jobs , Mr Spriggs says .
Wage growth was relatively strong in January . But as the president 's precipitate celebration of unemployment reminded , it is prudent not to read too much into one month 's figures .
You have to imagine the sommelier was fairly run off his feet on the January night in Paris , in 1984 , when the Ireland and France players met for their postmatch banquet . The contest had resulted in the usual French victory , but that did n't prevent the president of the French Rugby Federation at the time , Albert Ferrasse , from calling out Jean-Pierre Garuet , the uncompromising Lourdes prop , for his “ imbecilic ” action in getting himself sent off that afternoon .
The speeches went on , the wine flowed and then Jean-Pierre Rives , the France captain , stood up and grandly announced that Garuet was , in fact , “ a loyal team-mate ” and dedicated the victory to him , receiving a round of applause .
As it turned out that was Rives 's final season for France : a ruined shoulder put paid to a rugby life in which he established himself as a hard-as-nails , bloody-minded openside flanker but also become a kind of living symbol for everything that was and is supposedly different about French rugby . Blond haired , ridiculously light even then for a secondrow player , furious in the tackle and unashamedly wedded to the belief that rugby was more than merely a game – that it was both a brotherhood and a dream state – Rives was a one-off .
When he retired he did n't look twice at the conventional postrugby life of golf and moneyology , instead reinventing himself as a sculptor – he twists metal into beauty , much like on the field – and decamping to San Francisco , putting just enough kilometres between himself and his myth .
He rarely spoke about the game but did make himself available for one of the more unusual books of recent years , Richard Escot 's Rugby & Art , in which he riffs on just about every subject known to man , including Ireland , the only other country he reckons he would have enjoyed playing for .
“ If I had not been born French , I would have been happy to represent Ireland . I like the tragic , their empathy , their taste for all things larger than life . In fact , I have a real weakness for them . Their dramatic fighting spirit . More than fondness , I feel a certain kind of admiration . If I had n't been born French , I would have been very happy to be Irish . ”

Rives was an enforcer on the field and the scourge of opposition big men , but it was the three-quarters line that held his fascination : he never quite got over his deep-down wish to be a Jo Maso , a Gareth Edwards : “ the attitude , the elegance , they are the really gifted players capable of doing anything . And intelligent . ”
There is no disputing that a high point of the dismal winters of the 1980s – and perhaps of civilisation itself – was a lit fire on early kick-offs in Paris when Nigel Starmer-Smith or Bill McLaren became lost in admiration whenever the French backs – Sella , Charvet , Lagisquet , Lafond , Bonnevale , Blanco ; always Blanco – took a notion to run the ball . Just to see what would happen . France rugby teams seemed helpless then against their own wild mood swings , moving between violence and beauty from moment to moment .
In Pat Collins 's documentary on Frank O'Connor there 's a terrific moment when the American writer Richard Ford is reading a line from an O'Connor story and then breaks away to look at the camera and marvel : “ He was making it up as he went along . ”
And that was France rugby in a nutshell : they seemed to be inventing it in the moment as they ghosted through the mortal , step-too-slow defences of England , Ireland , addled Wales and ultrapale Scotland . Not for them the dreary reliability of rehearsed moves run and rerun 1,000 times , until the coach was satisfied they worked , but a kind of blind instinct and trust that if they just passed and ran they would arrive at the other end of the field in a magical blur of elusiveness and unorthodox passing . It was imagination unfolding before the tens of thousands of fans , and it has n't been bettered in the game for pure enjoyment .
Even 30 years on from Rives 's farewell season the idea persists of French rugby as separate , even if it feels like wishful thinking just now . Still this weekend is an odd and potentially treacherous assignment for an Ireland rugby team for whom the drum beats are resoundingly confident . They are n't so much expected to go into the Stade de France and boss this game as practically obliged to thereby set up a coup de theatre against England , in Dublin , on St Patrick 's Day .
It 's not hard to see how and why France have slowly become lost in the professional era . The cash-rich clubs call the shots ; the domestic teams are flooded with imported stars ; the structures for emerging talented players were neglected : the national team has become derailed and distracted .
Philippe Saint-André , one of the sprites of that thrilling era , and France head coach from 2012 to 2015 , said recently that “ our system killed a generation of players from 17 to 26. ” When France shocked everyone by winning the bid to host the 2023 Rugby World Cup , they painted a bleak forecast for the international game to back their case . Claude Atcher argued that the French bid can give World Rugby the serious financial injection needed to prevent the game from dying out in a decade , as most unions are losing money . “ If we do n't do anything , in five to 10 years you will have two , three to four teams on the same level and that 's all , and I think rugby will die . ”
If it was a scare tactic it worked .
Right now , this weekend , with a teenager playing number 10 for France , with its federation 's president , Bernard Laporte , under police investigation , with just three wins out of 11 last year , with a new coach , with no Six Nations or grand-slam title since 2010 , everything is pointing to French vulnerability .
These opportunities do n't come very often . It is only a matter of time before the French get their act together and field international teams reflective of their potential . And , of course , they ca n't ever be as cavalier and freewheeling as the France teams of two and three decades ago . Every era believes it is the era of enlightenment . But , three decades from now , rugby fans may look back at this period as a time when players were criminally overworked and their welfare and health terribly neglected , and when all joy and spontaneity were coached out of the game .
Rugby is a business , a professional entertainment as well as a sport , and right now the rugby we see on the field is defined by the vision of the coaches rather than of those who play it . And it works : if Joe Schmidt 's Ireland are n't exactly the most thrilling team to watch , they are rigorously and brilliantly organised – and they are pros . They are ranked third in the world .
Logic dictates that those qualities will prevail – and if France go out to just play the percentages in a normal , rehearsed game of rugby , then they probably will .
What will be interesting , though , is if the French can summon some of the wild chanciness and instinct and hauteur that used to make playing rugby in Paris such a terrifying prospect for visiting teams . And rugby had better hope that spirit is still in the French DNA . Because if that flame is gone from rugby , then what is left ?

A Stourbridge mum has issued a terrifying bronchiolitis warning to parent after a experiencing a horrifying three days .
Beth , 21 , took Myah to the doctor 's a week ago for eye-drops .
Myah 's breathing had at that point been fine , but over the weekend her condition deteriorated drastically .
The little fighter is now on the road to recovery , but Beth wants to alert fellow mums an ddads .
Myah is currently in hospital , her tiny body connected to breathing apparatus .
She is just six weeks old , as the Mirror reports .
`` It 's so easily missed and so bloody dangerous , '' she wrote in an impassioned Facebook post .
`` It had started with a nasty cough and normal symptoms , '' Beth later told Mirror Online .
`` Which quickly changed when her breathing started to rapidly get faster . Then the coughing fits started and she turned purple through lack of breath .
`` Other than that there are no more symptoms . This is why its so scary . ''
Things took a frightening turn for the worse at a Christmas party on Saturday when one coughing fit lead to Myah going purple for 15 long seconds .
Beth called 111 and managed to get an out-of-hours appointment with the doctor , who immediately sent them to hospital .
`` Myah was using muscles in her tummy to help her to breath that she should n't even be using to breathe , '' Beth explains .
`` I 've never seen a baby 's tummy pumping so fast fighting for the breaths , and I 've never been so scared . ''
The hospital visit is not something Beth is likely to ever forget .
`` When my baby girl was struggling to get her breaths and even the nurses were panicking , that 's when I just burst into tears .
`` Then they started to hook her up to all the machines . Within 20 minutes she was moved to the high dependency unit as she was n't responding to the low level of oxygen .
`` She had to have a feeding tube to enable her to have some kind of small feed . I had never felt fright and fear like it and I 've never felt so scared and helpless . ''
A common disease in infancy , bronchiolitis shares most of its symptoms with that of the common cold .
It 's because of this Beth feels moved make other parents aware of them .
`` You know if something is n't right , '' she adds , `` you know when they need to be checked . Just because a doctor one day says the child is fine and theres nothing to worry about , does n't mean the next day that things could have changed .
`` Bronchiolitis changes the child within hours , it can go from a snuffly nose to almost being unconscious within hours so always trust your instinct .
`` Listen to yourself and if ever you 're unsure just get your child checked . Never think you 're wasting anyone 's time . It 's better to be safe than sorry .
`` If Myah had had stayed struggling for her breaths for much longer it 's almost a definite that her breathing would have stopped for a short amount of time .
`` This can then lead to further complications . We are so lucky she has progressed in the way she has . And so grateful for all the good wishes and support with trying to raise awareness . ''

With Solihull poised to go to the polls next week , candidates of all party colours are stepping up their efforts to win local residents ' votes .
As the first council contests to be held in the borough since 2016 - save for a snow-hit by-election in Blythe earlier this year - it will be an interesting test of whether some fairly dramatic changes in the country 's political landscape will have a bearing on local results .
But what are the issues which may sway the voters in the borough 's 17 wards , which could very well swing the result in some of the more marginal seats ?
Crime
Worried residents often turn to councillors for reassurance when their road is hit by a spate of break-ins or off-road bikers are tearing up the local park .
The official data shows that Solihull has seen a rise in total recorded crime over the course of the past 12 months and Cllr Joe Tildesley ( Con , St Alphege ) , one of several former police officers to hold a council seat , told a recent meeting that the situation was `` deeply worrying '' .
A lot will hinge on whom the public holds responsible for the increase in offending .
Tory councillors have been highly critical of the region 's Police and Crime Commissioner , Labour 's David Jamieson , and , in particular , the decision to close Homer Road police station .
Opposition parties argue that the force is hamstrung by cuts in funding which have in fact been imposed by a Conservative Government . It remains to be seen who will be punished at the ballot box .

Housing
A recent application to build homes off Old Station Road , Hampton-in-Arden , which split the planning committee down the middle , demonstrates tensions over housing .
Half of members prioritised protecting the green belt , while half argued that there was a desperate shortage of affordable homes locally .
Interestingly the split is n't always along party lines . Bickenhill councillor Jim Ryan 's concerns that local residents could n't afford a home in the area where they grew up placed him on the opposite side of the debate to fellow Conservative Robert Grinsell ( Olton ) , who argued that the proposed development site was `` sacrosanct '' .
Dealing with the dilemma over where to put much-needed housing when many residents dread the loss of green space will continue to be a major headache for the local authority . A lot will depend on what voters decide is the greater priority .
HS2
For many years , the high-speed rail link has been just over the horizon , although finer details about Solihull 's much-discussed interchange station are at last coming into focus .
Often it is big , divisive developments which can lead to a major realignment in political allegiances in those wards on the front-line .
Disenchantment over the North Solihull Regeneration played a part in one-time Labour strongholds going Green , while the Lib Dems previously achieved a stranglehold over Shirley , during the years when controversy over the town centre 's redevelopment was raging .
Arguably HS2 is still a little too removed from day-to-day concerns to have a significant impact this year , although the trains are coming and seats could change hands as a result .
Inequality
During last month 's Budget , both the Green and Liberal Democrat leaders - Cllr James Burn and Cllr John Windmill - were highly critical of the lingering problem of inequality in Solihull .
Cllr Burn argued that the Conservative administration has failed to recognise the scale of the challenge or take sufficient steps to address it , although the ruling group points to various public health initiatives and recent developments such as Chelmund 's Cross - a flagship village centre in one of Solihull 's most deprived wards ( Chelmsley Wood ) .
While the best-known divide in Solihull is between the north and south of the borough , it is worth noting that pockets of deprivation exist often unacknowledged elsewhere .
Westminster
Inevitably national events shape local contests , even as councillors jockey for position over potholes and parkland .
The rapid reduction of the Lib Dem group locally mirrored the party 's slump in national support , while UKIP made its breakthrough in Kingshurst & Fordbridge the same year that the party surged in the country-wide polls .
Will similar shifts have a discernible effect in 2018 ? Will , for instance , Labour 's dramatic increase in members allow it to rebuild a base in Solihull ? Or perhaps the Brexit effect - a majority of Silhillians voted to Leave - will play its part . All will become clear when results are announced next Friday ( May 4 ) .
Since she was two-and-a-half years old , Tatum Anderson has been in gymnastics but it was n't until she began to compete at the age of five that she fell-in-love with the sport .
When she first started gymnastics , Tatum was at Little Flips in Yukon doing it recreationally to give her a fun activity to do when her baby brother was born .
The Yukon resident joined Matrix Gymnastics when she was five and her coaches encouraged her to begin competing . She was reluctant at first but her mother , Shannon Anderson , gave her the final push she needed and she decided to try it out .
It was love at first site .
“ I just told her that this was the next step , ” Shannon said . “ Once she was done with that first competition , she immediately asked me when the next one was . She loved it . ”
Amanda Walker was Tatum 's coach at Matrix and she was also the owner of the gym . A year after Tatum started at Matrix , Walker sold the gym to Giovanna Romero and Manuel Narvaez . Romero and Narvaez became Tatum 's coaches and that 's when she began to take off .
Tatum , 12 , competes in the U.S.A Gymnastics Junior Olympic division . There are 10 levels in the USAG Junior Olympic division . Tatum is currently at Level 8 .
Last year when she was at Level 7 , Tatum made it to the regional competition . She was the bar champion at the state competition and took second-place all-around . At the regional competition , Tatum took first-place in the bar and floor competitions and was second-place all-around in the entire competition .
In order to qualify for the regional completion , Tatum must place first , second , third or fourth in any individual event or the entire competition .
Because of her success at Level 7 last year , Tatum was selected with 36 other girls from Oklahoma to go to try out for the National Judges Cup . Tatum was one of six girls selected and was named to the top qualifier at the try out for the state of Oklahoma .
Tatum will get to represent Oklahoma at the National Judges Cup in Portland in the first weekend in January . She will compete in all four events : vault , bars , beam and floor . She said floor is her favorite event of the four .
“ I like getting to do my own routine on the floor , ” Tatum said . “ I like all of the events but floor is my favorite for sure . ”
Tatum and the rest of her Oklahoma teammates will compete against 16 other states at the Judges Cup .
Tatum is in the seventh-grade and she has gone to Yukon Public Schools her entire life but this year , she decided to switch to the homeschooling route to help manager her time . She will spend anywhere from four to six hours in the gym every day , so because she is homeschooled , she is still able to see her family in the evenings .
“ With her spending as much time in the gym as she is , we just felt like it was best that we switch her to being homeschooled because if she was in school and having to spend four to six hours at the gym on top of that , she would never get to see her family , ” Shannon said .
With her success she has had in the sport thus far , Tatum said it would be a great opportunity to be able to earn a scholarship and do what she loves at the collegiate level . She said her coaches believe she has a tremendous opportunity to earn a scholarship and do special things in her future in gymnastics .
Tatum said she would like to either coach or judge gymnastics when she is older and done competing .
“ I would love to get to coach or judge gymnastics in the future , ” Tatum said . “ I think that would be a great opportunity . ”
John Berger , the Booker prize-winning novelist and visionary writer who helped transform the way a generation looked at and perceived art , has died aged 90 .
Berger had a profound effect on how visual art was appreciated with his book Ways of Seeing and the 1972 BBC television series based on it .
Art and the wider world seemed to make more sense after watching Berger on the BBC , with his piercing blue eyes , steady delivery and groovy seventies shirt , eloquently explain perspective or the idealisation of the nude .
Susan Sontag once described Berger as peerless in his ability to make “ attentiveness to the sensual world ” meet “ imperatives of conscience ” . Jarvis Cocker , to mark a recent book of essays about Berger , said : “ There are a few authors that can change the way you look at the world through their writing and John Berger is one of them . ”
Rest in power John Berger ( 1926-2017 ) 💔 https : //t.co/HSIVBy0D8J — Verso Books ( @ VersoBooks ) January 2 , 2017
Listener , grinder of lenses , poet , painter , seer . My Guide . Philosopher . Friend . John Berger left us this morning . Now you are everywhere . — Simon McBurney ( @ SimonMcBurney ) January 2 , 2017
I loved # JohnBerger and so did the people I love most on this earth . He spent his life spinning a web of relationships . He was a wizard . — Naomi Klein ( @ NaomiAKlein ) January 2 , 2017
Berger lived for many years in a remote farmhouse in the French Alps , to where the British Library 's Jamie Andrews had to travel when the institution acquired Berger 's literary archive in 2009 .
More recently he lived in Antony , a suburb of Paris . It was from there he gave one of his final interviews with the Observer 's Kate Kellaway , giving his view , among other things , on the bigger picture around the Brexit vote .
“ It seems to me that we have to return , to recapitulate what globalisation meant , because it meant that capitalism , the world financial organisations , became speculative and ceased to be first and foremost productive , and politicians lost nearly all their power to take political decisions – I mean politicians in the traditional sense . Nations ceased to be what they were before . ”
Berger was a lifelong Marxist , a vehement critic of capitalism . He began his career as a painter before turning to writing , becoming an art critic for the New Statesman . He published his first novel , A Painter of our Time , in 1958 .

His picaresque novel G won the Booker prize in 1972 . Subsequent winners of the prize are routinely asked what they are going to do with the generous prize money and no-one has been able to better what Berger did . Disdainful of Booker McConnell 's historical association with indentured labour in the Caribbean , he said he would donate half the cash to the British Black Panthers , who were “ the black movement with the socialist and revolutionary perspective that I find myself most in agreement with in this country ” .
He kept the other half to support his work on a study of migrant workers which became the book with photographer Jean Mohr , A Seventh Man . – ( Guardian Service )
The global active pharmaceutical ingredients ( API ) market is prognosticated to showcase promising growth in the coming years , according to a report published by Transparency Market Research ( TMR ) . The market features vendors that have gained expertise in specific technologies , and are operating with cutting edge specialization in their production capacities . Leading names in the industry are Dow Chemicals , BASF and DuPont . Some other prominent players such as Teva , Sun Pharma , Cipla , Takeda , and Orchid Pharma , are seen expanding their business to emerging economies in the Asia Pacific such as India .

Vendors are expected to face the challenge of application of sophisticated technologies and gaining long-term contracts with international manufacturers , leading to optimized scale of economies . Manufacturers have been producing their own drugs to gain substantial profit margins and explore the pharmaceutical landscape better . The vendor landscape of the global active pharmaceutical ingredients market is moderately consolidated at the present . Due to stringency in quality checks and regulations , new players are hard-pressed to enter the market .
According to TMR 's report , the global active pharmaceuticals market is predicted to rise at a 6.4 % CAGR over the forecast period from 2017 to 2023 . The market stood at US $ 151,591.7 in 2017 , and is predicted to attain US $ 219,601.9 by 2023 .
The global API market has witnessed tremendous growth over the last few decades owing to the increased use of drugs and biologics in the treatment of diseases . The increasing adoption of quality standards in API manufacturing such as Good Manufacturing Practices ( GMP ) , current GMP ( cGMP ) , and the global adoption of International Conference on Harmonisation ( ICH ) guidelines , have helped improve the safety standards . On the other hand , the API industry is facing the challenges such as , shortening the development time , reducing the cost of development , improving the process design and meeting the quality standard without compromising on the profitability . The global API market is likely to be impacted by a large number of innovative drugs going off patent in the recent years .

Rising use of specialty medicines is anticipated to grow the pharmaceutical spending worldwide with quicker growth in richer , developed nations as compared to their emerging counterparts . This is primarily because the former have adequate manufacturing units , a higher spending power , and greater emphasis on transparent pricing by assessing measuring effects on the population .
Generic drugs benefit from the patent expiration of innovative drug as it makes them readily available in the market . The demand to produce quality medicines at lower and affordable costs creates a scenario , where the needs for generic drugs increase . It has been estimated that generic drugs save approximately USD 3 billion every week in the United States . In 2013 , unbranded generic drugs accounted for more than 80 % of the prescription drugs being distributed , primarily due to their low price for patients , payers , and the healthcare system . Therefore , the rise in the demand for generic drugs is expected to be one of the major drivers for the API market .
Other factors playing a vital role for the growth of this market include the rise in the geriatric population with an increase in chronic and lifestyles related disorders , technological advancements in the process of API manufacture , and rising preference for targeted therapy approach in cancer treatment .

Political factors and fears of adverse public reaction play a significant role in determining if long-serving prisoners are kept in jail , according to an extensive new study .
NUI Galway law lecturer Dr Diarmuid Griffin has found that the criteria which impact on whether or not someone sentenced to life in prison is released include the current overall murder rate and the media profile of the convict .
Criminal justice policies , particularly sentencing policy , have become more draconian in recent years . The number of life sentences handed down for serious crimes like murder is increasing across Europe , but the rate of increase in Ireland is significantly greater than average .
According to Dr Griffin 's forthcoming book Killing Time , there were some 27,000 life-sentence prisoners in custody in Europe in 2014 , an increase of 66 per cent since 2004 .
In Ireland , the number of life-sentence prisoners increased by 78 per cent over the same period , and now stands at 352 .
At the same time , the average length a life-sentence prisoner spends in prison has increased dramatically and consistently . In 1975 , it was less than eight years , in 2004 it was 14 years , and in 2016 it was 22 years .
The vast majority – 95 per cent – of those currently serving a life term in Ireland have been convicted of murder , with sentences for manslaughter and rape making up the remainder . Life is the mandatory sentence for murder , and judges have no discretion in the matter .
Final decision
Life-sentence prisoners are assessed for release by the Parole Board , but the final decision lies with the Minister for Justice .
Dr Griffin , who interviewed three former ministers for justice and 14 current and former Parole Board members , found criteria which have little to do with the offender being assessed often decide if they are released or not .
“ Members and ministers cited offenders with high media profiles as causing particular problems due to the potential political fallout arising from a recommendation and/or decision to release , ” Dr Griffin said .
He said former ministers were “ explicit that a decision to release a life-sentence prisoner presented a political risk ” , and the potential for “ adverse publicity , political criticism and personal electoral consequences ” were cited as influencing factors .
“ If you let a rapist out and the next thing he does is rape another person , whoever does it [ orders their release ] …whoever is responsible for it , will be visited with the responsibility for that act , so you do have to protect people , ” one former minister said .
Dr Griffin examined the case of Malcolm MacArthur , who was Ireland 's longest serving prisoner until his release in 2012 by then minister for justice Alan Shatter . MacArthur was sentenced to life in 1982 for two murders after one of the most high-profile manhunts in Irish history .
“ I think he 's [ MacArthur ] now out , but it took an awful lot of time , and one of the reasons that he was kept in I think was that the politicians were just afraid of , you know that he would do something bizarre if he got out . I knew there was a zilch risk of reoffending , ” one former justice minister told Dr Griffin .
Public opinion
Former justice ministers cited media coverage , particularly tabloid newspaper coverage , of high-profile murderers as being a factor in decisions .
“ Obviously I had to be conscious of public opinion , and how it would affect politically both me and then my government . You always have one eye on what the people think in making decisions , ” one former minister said .
In the past the media did not report on the release of high-profile criminals from prison ; in 1976 there was no coverage of the fact that a man was released having served just six years for murdering his fiancé .
This has now changed , and the release of prisoners such as Larry Murphy attract significant and sustained media coverage which is often accompanied by public criticism of their early release .
One former minister said when he was in office people thought prison terms were very low , but he corrected that impression . “ People had got to the notion thinking that a life sentence was seven years , and I mean that was often said on radio and television that people were getting out after seven years , and they did n't believe that after I was finished . ”
The rising murder rate in Ireland , particularly gangland murders , also contributed to a reluctance to release life-sentence prisoners , even in cases where the prisoner 's crime had nothing to do with organised crime .
One parole board member noted in a 2006 annual report that “ so common had murder become that human life had been cheapened and that the board must react to that ” .
Dr Griffin said making a decision on whether to release a prisoner based on factors outside their control “ could prove counter-productive ” in terms of their rehabilitation .
“ What real incentive is there for a life-sentence prisoner to participate meaningfully when , despite being informed of the importance of engaging with the available services to reduce risk levels , there are additional insuperable barriers preventing a recommendation or decision to release ? ”
Individual cases
He also questioned if the length of life terms will decrease if the murder rate decreases . “ If it is not appropriate to reduce time served in individual cases on the basis of an overall decrease in annual homicides it should not be acceptable to increase time served when there is a spike . ”
The Parole Bill 2016 is currently before the Oireachtas . If passed in its current form it will introduce major reforms to the parole process . The final decision on whether to release life-sentence prisoners will rest with the Parole Board and not the Minister . Prisoners will also have to serve a minimum of 12 years before being considered for release .
The former ministers interviewed by Dr Griffin had a mixed reaction to a reduced role for politicians , with one suggesting the Parole Board should obtain the Minister 's opinion “ in serious cases ” .
Another former minister stated : “ It is important to prevent a practice under which releases that should be granted are refused because of ministerial fear of adverse publicity and political criticism , with possible personal electoral consequences . ”

[ Click here for a Noozhawk photo gallery from the event . ]
Leaders and innovators from the local business and technology community gathered at Fess Parker 's DoubleTree Resort for the 19th Annual South Coast Business & Technology Awards , a highly anticipated annual event that is always well-attended .
More than 700 people gathered to recognize South Coast businesses and technical professionals , as well as honor outstanding local students attending Santa Barbara City College , UC Santa Barbara and Westmont College for achievements and awards provided by the Scholarship Foundation of Santa Barbara .
The Scholarship Foundation is a vehicle for generosity to reach goals of encouraging and supporting students who are motivated to achieve a higher-education degree .
As the evening approached , the stage was set in the beautiful Plaza Del Sol rotunda as guests dressed in business attire mingled and networked during an opening reception in view of the glistening Pacific Ocean .
When guests finished arriving from local businesses and schools , the dinner began inside the Grand Ballroom with a welcome and thank you from steering committee co-chairwoman Danna McGrew , CPA , partner at Bartlett , Pringle & Wolf LLP .
The event attracted nearly 80 corporate sponsors , including Noozhawk , which ensured that the Scholarship Foundation received more than $ 130,000 in net proceeds this year to support local students majoring in business and technology fields at UCSB , Westmont and SBCC . More than 600 scholarship awards totaling more than $ 1.45 million already have been provided for local youths and a growing pool of local , college-educated future employees .
Following dinner , the buzz of anticipation grew within the crowd , eager to view the five prestigious awards presented for 2013 .
The Excellence in Service award to Westmont College was accepted by president Dr. Gayle Beebe , who has raised $ 100 million for the school since he began in 2007 . Westmont is a Santa Barbara liberal arts college featuring 26 majors , 11 pre-professional programs and a fifth-year credential program , and serving 1,355 students .
Barbara Rosenblum , founder of Strategic Healthcare Programs , received the Entrepreneur of the Year award and told Noozhawk about the 15-year-old boot-strap company started in Santa Barbara that collects health-care information “ from all over the country to help health-care providers improve the quality of the care they give by feeding them instant real time information and data . ”
“ I had to boot-strap my company , and I went into it because I was young enough and naïve enough not to really know what could go wrong , ” Rosenblum said . “ But it really worked out . I worked so hard to get where I am . We were 40th in the market when we started , and now we 're pretty much the last man standing . ”
The Company of the Year honor went to Sonos , a producer of wireless home music systems and HiFi music players headquartered in Santa Barbara and employing 600 people globally .
Joanne Funari , who admitted some nervousness to Noozhawk before accepting the honor of Executive of the Year , spoke to the crowd about her team at Business First Bank and her father , Joe , who gave her basic business principles .
“ This is an amazing event , and the thing that 's so fabulous about this event is the honorees speak from their heart and we learn something from everyone , ” said Funari , a founding member of Business First Bank who serves as executive vice president and market area president for Santa Barbara and Ventura counties .
The Pioneer Award was presented to Larry Barels , founder of businesses in the fields of advertising , real estate development and technology , including WaveFront Technologies , Driveway and Aqueous .
Barels and his wife have been regular contributors to the Scholarship Foundation and are very involved in many of the charities involving families , children and education in Santa Barbara . He told Noozhawk about the unique dynamics of the event .
“ It 's wonderful to be in this environment and see so many people that I 've worked with and seen in the community for so many years , ” Barels said . “ And it 's just a wonderful opportunity — you 're really humbled to be with these people . ”
The Excellence in Service award goes to a company providing strong customer and community service , while the Entrepreneur of the Year honor is presented to an individual with a successful career of entrepreneurial endeavors . The Company of the Year is a market leader that demonstrates profitability and strong growth . Additionally , the Executive of the Year is for a senior executive who has increased company profitability with strengthened market presence and a vigorous passion for the local community . Finally , an individual with a long history of outstanding leadership or innovations in business or technology on the South Coast receives the Pioneer Award .
Since 1962 , the Scholarship Foundation of Santa Barbara has helped motivated and deserving students with scholarships and counseling to positively affect the lives of local youth .
The foundation provides financial aid advising services to more than 25,000 students and parents each year . These impressive feats have earned the foundation a four-star rating from Charity Navigator , a national independent evaluator of nonprofits .
Tuition and fees at public four-year colleges have increased at an average annual rate of 6 percent beyond inflation over the past decade , and the foundation 's mission has resulted in the largest community-based program in the United States to help bridge this gap .
San Marcos High School graduate Filipp Kozachuk , 20 , was born in Kiev , Ukraine , and has been a Santa Barbara resident since age 2 . Kozachuk 's introduction to the Scholarship Foundation began at high school , and with its critical support he 's now entering his junior year as an economics and business major at Westmont . He spoke to Noozhawk about the impact that the organization has on young people 's lives .
“ It is essential to be able to afford college . I think on one end it 's the financial contribution that helps a lot , but even more so it 's the community of people that are networked within the Scholarship Foundation , ” Kozachuk said . “ I 've met so many people , and I 've interned at people 's companies that I 've met at various meetings . ”
The Scholarship Foundation of Santa Barbara does not charge an administrative fee , and 100 percent of contributions to support scholarships goes directly to deserving students .
Each year the SCB & T Awards are made possible through community support from businesses and individuals , and the Scholarship Foundation of Santa Barbara graciously expresses gratitude to the 2013 sponsors :
» Founding Sponsor : Union Bank
» Executive Level Sponsor : Cooley
» Director Level Sponsors : Bartlett Pringle & Wolf LLP , Cox , Fred and Linda Gluck , Montecito Bank & Trust , Rabobank and Strategic Healthcare Programs

Children 's rights activist Christina Noble has spoken for the first time about her son Thomas who was taken from her when she was in St Patrick 's Mother and Baby Home on the Navan Road in Dublin .
Saint Patrick 's was one of the largest mother and baby homes in terms of numbers and was designated a special institution exclusively for single mothers .
The founder of the Christina Noble Children 's Foundation said she has never spoken publicly about her son being taken away from here until now .
Ms Noble was speaking at the launch of My Name Is Bridget ; The Untold Story of Bridget Dolan and the Tuam Mother and Baby Home by journalist Alison O'Reilly .
Minister for Children Katherine Zappone is to bring proposals to Cabinet about the prospects of identifying babies in a mass grave in a former religious-run institution in Tuam ,
“ I loved Thomas . He was gorgeous . I have never spoken publicly about Thomas because of the pain.The unbearable pain , ” Ms Noble said .
“ I still never found Thomas , I was told that they had sent him to America and I do n't know if they have or they have n't , ” she said .
“ I tried to find papers about him but I never found out where he went . In my last moment with Thomas , there was a nun there . I went up for his next feed and he was gone . I asked a nun there where Thomas was and she told me he has gone to a good Catholic home , ” she said .
Author Alison O'Reilly dedicated the book to the memory of all the children who died in the care of the State and the Tuam babies .
“ Unfortunately there are things that are happening in the child protection system today that are still not right and I do n't believe the voice of the child is being heard , ” she said .
Anna Corrigan of the Tuam Babies Family Group , which represents families with relatives in the grave and survivors from the home , said she wanted justice for survivors . “ If we get Tuam right , everything else will follow , ” she said .
“ We as a group need truth , justice , accountability , prosecution and restitution is what we as a group need . Taking some money and throwing it at us is not good enough , ” she said .
Verne Troyer , the actor best known for his role as Mini-Me in the “ Austin Powers ” franchise , had a blood alcohol level three times the legal driving limit hen he died on Saturday , according to a report .
TMZ says Troyer called 911 and let dispatchers know that he was suicidal . He was unresponsive upon arrival at the hospital and had to be transferred to a second hospital that was better suited to treating the 49-year-old actor .
Troyer was placed on life support after his organs began to fail . An autopsy has been completed , but a toxicology report is pending .
Troyer had struggled with alcoholism for years , according to TMZ .
According to a statement on his Facebook page , Troyer was “ a fighter when it came to his own battles . Over the years he 's struggled and won , struggled and won , struggled and fought some more , but unfortunately this time was too much . ”
Mike Myers , who played both the title character and Dr . Evil in the “ Austin Powers ” movies , paid homage to his co-star through a statement to Entertainment Weekly .
In the last two months of the year , financial markets responded to the unanticipated election of Donald Trump in a textbook fashion — not only at the asset class level , with the major moves up in stocks and government yields , but also within asset classes as financials and the dollar surged .
In doing so , they were responding to prospects for higher growth , inflation and market inflows following the President-Elect 's policy announcements on deregulation , tax reform and infrastructure . Even more impressive , this occurred in a remarkably-orderly fashion , with little evidence of distress among investors , many of whom were not set up for the sharp re-pricing of financial assets .
Trumponomics will remain an important market influence in 2017 , with investors particularly interested in two things : the transition from announcements to detailed design and sustained implementation ; and outcomes , particularly when it comes to the mix between higher growth and inflation . But when it comes to the evolution of the trifecta that influences most the wellbeing of investors — that is , returns , correlations and volatility — four other macro influences will also be in play :
Monetary policy beyond data dependency : The anticipation of a more active fiscal policy under a Trump administration , together with relatively firm economic numbers , will encourage the Federal Reserve to evolve its policy stance beyond just responding to high frequency data releases . It will become more strategic and be inclined to tighten somewhat beyond what the markets are currently expecting .
Imperfect global policy rebalancing : Such Fed tightening is part of a gradual policy rebalancing after too many years of excessive reliance on central banks . This is a good thing as the benefits of unbalanced policies have been declining while costs and risks have been rising . But only the United States , with its stronger economy and the endogenous political disruption occasioned by Trump 's surprise election , is able and willing to undertake this policy transition . In the systemically-important economies of Asia and Europe , the People 's Bank of China , the Bank of Japan and the European Central Bank will remain the “ only game in town ” policy-wise .

Divergence and the risk of too strong a dollar appreciation : Greater disparity in policies and economic performance will widen interest rate differentials and place further appreciation pressure on the dollar . As more Asian and European financial capital migrates to the US in search of higher returns , the dollar will appreciate beyond what economic relationships can readily support , thereby fuelling anti-globalisation rhetoric and increasing the risk of protectionism .
Dealing with the anti-establishment surge : Non-traditional movements , while even more influential on both side of the Atlantic , will probably have different implications . In the US , with its stricter checks and balances among the three arms of government — executive , legislative and judicial — political disruptions will occur within broadly stable parameters as to how the economy operates . Not so in Europe where unpredictability extends to the most basic economic parameters , from the redesign of the UK 's trading relations to growing nationalist pressures in France , the Netherlands and ( even ) Germany that hinder the needed strengthening of the regional architecture and increase its vulnerability .
All this speaks to 2017 's heightened “ unusual uncertainty ” as both political and economic systems continue to respond to too many years of growth that has been too low and insufficiently inclusive . It is a situation that raises tricky questions for investors , not only about what to think but also how to do so . With that , conventional tools of analysis and prediction are being further challenged , especially when it comes to evolving portfolio positioning with longer-term trends .
In the weeks ahead , the expansion of the Trump Rally depends on how the new Administration governs relative to its electoral promises . Beyond that , it requires that other countries overcome the headwinds of political fluidity to join the US in rebalancing their fiscal-monetary policy mix while , importantly , also pursuing pro-growth structural reforms . In the meantime , investors would be well advised to book some profits while also rebalancing some of their remaining risk exposures in favour of sectors that have lagged behind ( such as traditional tech ) , and also to emerging markets with strong balance sheets , limited currency mismatches and sound management .

The Goleta Design Review Board gave the Westar mixed-use project preliminary approval Tuesday , and the final plans are expected to be reviewed in early July .
The entire project calls for 266 residential units , five live/work residential units , parks , stores and restaurants on the land north of Hollister Avenue between Glen Annie Road and Santa Felicia Drive .
It has been going through the city review process since 2009 , and the previous plans were approved by the City Council in October .
However , developer Goleta Hollister LLC settled a lawsuit with Glen Annie Road resident Patricia Moreno and made alterations to the plans . A few smaller commercial buildings were eliminated , since they were planned to be directly across the street from Moreno 's home .
Westar also replaced three small commercial buildings with more residential units , but the change eliminates only a fraction of the total retail space , according to city attorney Tim Giles has .
The developer presented some minor landscaping and design changes to the board Tuesday afternoon , and board members asked for lockable trash enclosures to prevent them being used at nighttime .
For final approvals , the board will review a site plan , elevation , landscaping , floor plans and mechanical systems , even though many of those things have already gone through review .

Brighton sealed promotion to the Premier League , and moved a step closer to winning the SkyBet Championship , after beating Wigan 2-1 at a jubilant Amex Stadium .
The win was enough to spark jubilant scenes at the Amex Stadium , but their elevation to the top table was not confirmed mathematically until Huddersfield drew 1-1 at Derby in the late kick-off .
Jacob Butterfield 's 88th-minute equaliser was enough to cancel out Collin Quaner 's effort and formalise the Seagulls celebration party .
Glenn Murray had opened the scoring for Chris Hughton 's side eight minutes before half-time , his 22nd goal of the campaign and fifth in as many games at home .
England Under-21 international Solly March ensured the celebrations could continue in earnest when he converted Anthony Knockaert 's cutback and a late goal from substitute Nick Powell could not change the picture .
Newcastle , league leaders for so long , slipped to seven points behind the Seagulls as they took their winless run to three matches with a 3-1 reverse at Ipswich .
Freddie Sears put the hosts ahead just before half-time , but when former Tractor Boy and Irish striker Daryl Murphy levelled in the second half the Magpies had a chance to switch their fortunes .
Instead they conceded twice more , Irish international David McGoldrick and Emyr Huws the scorers .
Gianfranco Zola 's brief and forgettable stint at Birmingham ended after a 2-0 defeat at home to Burton left Blues two places and three points clear of the drop .
Burton leapfrogged their opponents in the table after Lloyd Dyer and Lucas Akins hit the net and Zola 's 22-game reign came to an end within minutes of the final whistle .

Rickie Fowler took a step towards Phoenix Open redemption when he earned a share of the halfway lead with fellow American Bryson DeChambeau in Arizona on Friday .
Fowler and DeChambeau both carded five-under 66s at TPC Scottsdale for 10-under-par 132 totals , one stroke clear of compatriots Daniel Berger and Chez Reavie .
Eighteen players are bunched within three shots of the leaders , including Phil Mickelson and Jon Rahm , who are both on seven-under .
However , Hideki Matsuyama 's hopes of winning the tournament for a third consecutive year evaporated when the Japanese world number five pulled out before hitting a shot , citing a left thumb and wrist injury . He had shot a two-under 69 on Thursday .
Two years ago , Matsuyama beat Fowler in a playoff after the American plonked his tee shot into a water hazard at the fourth extra hole .
Meanwhile Shane Lowry scraped inside the level par cut mark by a stroke after failing to catch fire in the Arizona desert , as he shot a level par second round of 71 .
After Thursday 's opening effort of 70 - which saw him flirt with a hole in one in front of the baying crowds of the 16th - Friday 's round was much less eventful .
Indeed , Lowry could only muster two birdies on day two , before giving them back to leave himself on one under par for the tournament , nine strokes off the tournament lead and in a share of 63rd place .

Despite his status as a fan favourite , and a healthy world ranking of seventh , Fowler knows he has let too many tournaments slip away , with 12 career runner-up finishes on the PGA Tour to go with his four official victories .
He looked set to claim the solo lead on Friday until he overcooked his chip shot at the par-four 17th for a soft bogey .
“ Was in good position to make birdie there , a little unfortunate to make bogey , ( but ) other than that solid day , kept moving in the right direction , ” Fowler told the Golf Channel after his 11th consecutive round of 70 or better at the venue .
“ We 're in a good spot going into the weekend . This is a place we know we can continue to play well . I 'm comfortable on this course .
“ We 'll piece together the nines at some point . Yesterday we started on the back and got off to a decent start there and then cooled down a little on the front . Today played the front nine well . ”
DeChambeau , a physics major who applies his understanding of the science to his swing , rifled his approach shot to inside a foot to birdie the last and join Fowler at the top of the leaderboard .
American Robert Garrigus hit the shot of the day at the driveable par-four 17th , almost making a rare albatross .
His tee shot landed short of the green and the ball bounded forward and clattered against the pin , but somehow did not drop in , settling a couple of inches way . He settled for an eagle and finished the day eight strokes behind .
World number three Jordan Spieth missed the cut by one shot , the American finishing on even-par 142 to suffer his first weekend off since last May .

A schoolboy was stabbed in the head outside a Birmingham mosque in a random attack by a man carrying a knife , a court heard .
Dominic Palmer also carried out a second attack on a woman on her way to work in the street hours later , it was alleged .
The 29-year-old , of Herbert Road , Small Heath , has denied two charges of attempted murder and two of wounding with intent .
Stephen Linehan QC , prosecuting at Birmingham Crown Court , said : “ This case is about two attacks carried out in two streets in Small Heath on the same day on two people but some hours apart .
“ The man who carried out the attacks used a knife and his intent was to kill .
“ Mercifully he failed and they survived . ”
Mr Linehan said the first victim was a 15-year-old , who along with his family , had attended the Idaara Maarif-e-Islam mosque in Herbert Road for a Muslim festival .
They left but he and his father returned at around 1am to pick up an older brother , said Mr Linehan .
“ Unknown to them the defendant had left his flat armed with a knife and gone in the streets of Small Heath looking for a victim , ” he said .
Mr Linehan said Palmer had walked down Herbert Road and then “ without warning ” attacked the teenager .
“ There is no evidence to suggest these two had ever met before or knew each other in any way .
“ The teenager was simply a victim chosen at random .
“ The same applies to the next victim some hours later . ”
Mr Linehan said Palmer stabbed the 15-year-old a number of times , twice to the front before “ driving the knife through his skull and into his brain ” .
“ He was screaming and his father and others came to help .
“ When they got to him he was lying on the floor unconscious . The defendant had run away . ”
The victim was rushed to hospital , where doctors saved his life .
Police arrested Palmer at his home later that morning and officers found a pair of blood-stained tracksuit trousers and trainers , he said .
They were unaware at the time that , at around 5.45am , he had carried out another attack on Mitzie Harper , a woman in her 50 's who had been on her way to a cleaning job , said Mr Linehan .
Palmer brushed against her as she was walking down Cyril Road , the court heard .
“ Something about the look on his face made her feel uneasy and she turned to look back , ” Mr Linehan said .
She saw him walking away but he then came back up behind her and launched an attack , with the knife causing “ nasty wounds . ”
In a recorded interview , Mrs Harper said the main thing she remembered about her attacker was his “ scary eyes ” .

Why it matters : Netflix could be preparing to introduce its most expensive tier to date . Some users in Europe have discovered an “ Ultra ” service plan that is costlier than the ‘ Premium ' option . Should the change become permanent for everyone , subscribers on other tiers may find themselves losing some features .
First reported by TuttoAndroid , a number of Netflix customers in Italy and Germany have discovered the fourth service tier , which ranges from 16.99 Euros per month to 19.99 Euros .
In some cases , the new addition has resulted in the number of simultaneous streams on the Premium plan being halved from 4 to 2 . Should Premium users want to increase this back up to four , they 'll have to opt for the more expensive Ultra tier , which has all of Premium 's other benefits including 4K playback . The move also affects the standard plan , where multiple simultaneous streams are eliminated completely—streaming will be possible on only one device at a time .
For other people , the change left the number of simultaneous streams the same for each current tier , but Ultra was the only option for those wishing to take advantage of High Dynamic Range ( HDR ) content—a move those with HDR TVs will argue is even worse .
While an Ultra tier priced at $ 16.99 or higher could come to the US , Netflix spokesperson Smita Saran told CNET , `` We continuously test new things at Netflix and these tests typically vary in length of time . In this case , we are testing slightly different price points and features to better understand how consumers value Netflix . ''
There 's no guarantee that the Ultra tier will be rolled out to everyone , but if it is , many users will be unhappy about what appears to be a sneaky price hike . However , with the platform now the most popular way of watching video content on TV in the US , Netflix wo n't be concerned .
Wild bees , such as bumblebees , do n't get as much love as honeybees , but they should . They play just as crucial a role in pollinating many fruits , vegetables , and wildflowers , and compared to managed colonies of honeybees , they 're in much greater jeopardy .
A group of scientists in the United Kingdom decided to look at how bumblebee queens are affected by some widely used and highly controversial pesticides known as neonicotinoids . What they found is n't pretty .
Neonics , as they 're often called , are applied as a coating on the seeds of some of the most widely grown crops in the country , including corn , soybeans , and canola . These pesticides are `` systemic '' — they move throughout the growing plants . Traces of them end up in pollen , which bees consume . Neonicotinoid residues also have been found in the pollen of wildflowers growing near fields and in nearby streams .
The scientists , based at Royal Holloway University of London , set up a laboratory experiment with bumblebee queens . They fed those queens a syrup containing traces of a neonicotinoid pesticide called thiamethoxam , and the amount of the pesticide , they say , was similar to what bees living near fields of neonic-treated canola might be exposed to .
Bumblebee queens exposed to the pesticide were 26 percent less likely to lay eggs , compared to queens that were n't exposed to the pesticide . The team published their findings in the journal Nature Ecology and Evolution .
`` Without the queen laying eggs , there is no colony , '' says Nigel Raine , one of the scientists who conducted the experiment . Raine helped start the experiment , but has since moved to the University of Guelph in Canada .
According to Raine and his colleagues , the reduction in reproduction is so large that wild bumblebee populations exposed to these chemicals could enter a spiral of decline and eventually die out .
`` To me , based on the data we have , it seems like quite a big impact , '' Raine says .
But he says scientists do n't know how harmful the pesticide exposure is in the wild , compared to other perils the bees face , such as disappearing wildflowers that bees rely on for food . `` I do n't think we have a really good handle on how important , say , nutrition limitation is — if they ca n't find the right flowers . Or parasite loads . I 'd say [ neonic exposure ] is important and significant , but other factors may be important and significant , too , '' he says .
The results are likely to strengthen calls for further restrictions on use of the pesticides . The European Union imposed a temporary moratorium on use of neonicotinoid pesticides on many crops in 2013 , and is now considering proposals to make that moratorium permanent . Pesticide companies and some farmers are fighting those restrictions . They argue that the moratorium has led to lower yields of canola and an increase in spraying of other pesticides to fight insects that previously were controlled by neonicotinoid coatings on seeds .

A Dublin man has gone on trial accused of breaking into an elderly farmer 's home with two others and beating the victim with bats for a small sum of money .
Adam Marlowe ( 23 ) of Walkinstown Drive , Walkinstown , has pleaded not guilty to aggravated burglary and assaulting Malachy Turley causing him harm at Kettles Lane , Kinsealy , Dublin , on July 29 , 2016 .
He has also pleaded not guilty at Dublin Circuit Criminal Court to robbing €50 from the then 81-year-old complainant on the same date .
Antonia Boyle , prosecuting , read Mr Turley 's Garda statement to the jury , in which he described how three men wearing homemade balaclavas broke into the man 's home and attacked him . Ms Boyle explained that a witness statement can be read into the court record and taken as direct evidence when agreed by prosecution and defence .
In the statement , Mr Turley said he had been living alone at his family home since 1986 after his mother 's death and rarely left the premises or received any visitors .
He said he had retired from farming a few years previously and allowed people to keep horses on his land for €100 a month .
Mr Turley described how he had woken up in the early hours of July 29th , as was usual , to have a cup of tea and a slice of apple tart .
He said he went back to bed after a half hour and was roused again from his sleep to find a man standing in his bedroom doorway .
The complainant said he grabbed his walking stick to defend himself but then saw two other “ fit lads ” . He told gardaí­ the men wore homemade balaclavas and carried bats , a small blade and a firearm that looked like an imitation gun .
Mr Turley said the three intruders pushed him onto his bed and beat him as they screamed : “ Where 's the safe , where 's the safe ? ” He said they called him by his first name during the attack .
The complainant stated that one of the men had a “ Dublin suburbs ” accent and kept hitting him and demanding money while the two other attackers left the room .
“ I was just lying there and taking the beating , not thinking ahead ” , Mr Turley told gardaí .
He said he went unconscious at one point during the beating and that when the two intruders re-entered his room , he was pulled to the floor and his mattress thrown on top of him .
He said he heard the gang pull his bedroom apart , get hold of keys and walk out of his room . He described lying under his mattress for up to 30 minutes before he emerged .
Mr Turley said he put his mattress back on his bed with difficulty due to his bad hip and fell asleep for a time . He said he recalled thinking that if the intruders had taken his phone and car that he would be “ badly stuck ” .
He stated that he could n't remember feeling pain but thought it was because he was in shock . When he got up , he found his house ransacked , €50 missing from his wallet and two small bags of coins taken from his bookshelf .
He revealed that he waited a while to ring his brother because he did n't want to disturb him so early .
Mr Turley said he received five stitches to his hand , suffered bruising to his body and was prescribed painkillers . He told gardaí that his “ main concern was that this incident could have been worse ” and that he did n't want anyone else to go through his ordeal .
Earlier , Ms Boyle told the jury in her opening address that Garda forensics recovered a piece of blue material in Mr Turley 's bedroom and that DNA recovered from this matched the accused .
She said it was the State 's case that Mr Marlowe was one of the three men who entered the complainant 's house , attacked him and robbed him .
The trial continues before Judge Melanie Greally and a jury of eight men and four women .

TEMPE , Ariz./SAN FRANCISCO ( Reuters ) - An Uber self-driving car hit and killed a woman crossing the street in Arizona , police said on Monday , marking the first fatality involving an autonomous vehicle and a potential blow to the technology expected to transform transportation .
The ride services company said it was suspending North American tests of its self-driving vehicles , which are currently going on in Arizona , Pittsburgh and Toronto .
So-called robot cars , when fully developed by companies including Uber , Alphabet Inc and General Motors Co , are expected to drastically cut down on motor vehicle fatalities and create billion-dollar businesses . But Monday 's accident underscored the possible challenges ahead for the promising technology as the cars confront real-world situations involving real people .
U.S. lawmakers have been debating legislation that would speed introduction of self-driving cars .
“ This tragic accident underscores why we need to be exceptionally cautious when testing and deploying autonomous vehicle technologies on public roads , ” said Democratic Senator Edward Markey , a member of the transportation committee , in a statement .
Elaine Herzberg , 49 , was walking her bicycle outside the crosswalk on a four-lane road in the Phoenix suburb of Tempe about 10 p.m. MST Sunday ( 0400 GMT Monday ) when she was struck by the Uber vehicle traveling at about 40 miles per hour ( 65 km per hour ) , police said . The Volvo XC90 SUV was in autonomous mode with an operator behind the wheel .
Herzberg later died from her injuries in a hospital , police said .
“ The pedestrian was outside of the crosswalk . As soon as she walked into the lane of traffic she was struck , ” Tempe Police Sergeant Ronald Elcock told reporters at a news conference . He said he did not yet know how close Herzberg was to the vehicle when she stepped into the lane .
Elcock said he believed Herzberg may have been homeless .
The San Francisco Chronicle late Monday reported that Tempe Police Chief Sylvia Moir said that from viewing videos taken from the vehicle “ it 's very clear it would have been difficult to avoid this collision in any kind of mode ( autonomous or human-driven ) based on how she came from the shadows right into the roadway . '' ( bit.ly/2IADRUF )
Moir told the Chronicle , “ I suspect preliminarily it appears that the Uber would likely not be at fault in this accident , ” but she did not rule out that charges could be filed against the operator in the Uber vehicle , the paper reported .
The “ Tempe Police Department does not determine fault in vehicular collisions , ” the department said in a statement late Monday , in reply to questions from Reuters about the chief 's comments . “ Ultimately the investigation will be submitted to the Maricopa County Attorney 's Office for review and any potential charges . ”
Tempe authorities and federal officials are still investigating the incident . Canada 's transportation ministry in Ontario , where Uber conducts testing , also said it was reviewing the accident .

Volvo , the Swedish car brand owned by China 's Geely , said the software controlling the car in the crash was not its own .
Video footage will aid the ongoing investigation , and the case would be submitted to the district attorney , Elcock said .
“ Our investigators have that information , and they will be using that in their investigation as well as the Maricopa County Attorney 's Office as part of their investigation , ” said Elcock . “ They are going to attempt to try to find who was possibly at fault and how we can better be safe , whether it 's pedestrians or whether it 's the vehicle itself . ”
WILD WEST
Uber and Waymo on Friday urged Congress to pass sweeping legislation to speed the introduction of self-driving cars into the United States . Some congressional Democrats have blocked the legislation over safety concerns , and Monday 's fatality could hamper passage of the bill , congressional aides said Monday .

Safety advocates called for a national moratorium on all robot car testing on public roads .
“ Arizona has been the wild west of robot car testing with virtually no regulations in place , ” said Consumer Watchdog , a non-profit consumer advocacy group , in a statement . “ That 's why Uber and Waymo test there . When there 's no sheriff in town , people get killed . ”
Arizona has opened its arms to companies testing self-driving vehicles as a means to economic growth and jobs . Republican Governor Doug Ducey reached out to Uber in 2016 after California regulators cracked down on the company over its failure to obtain testing permits .
Self-driving cars being tested routinely get into fender-benders with other vehicles . Last week , a self-driving Uber crashed with another vehicle in Pittsburgh , local news reported . There were no injuries .

A year ago , Uber temporarily grounded its self-driving cars for a few days following a crash with another car in Tempe . The company has been the subject of a number of complaints about its autonomous vehicles , but the company has said the cars were being driven by a human driver at the time of the incidents .
ESSENTIAL TO UBER 'S SUCCESS
Uber has said its ability to build autonomous cars is essential to its success in the rapidly changing transportation industry . The company envisions a network of autonomous cars that would be summoned through the Uber app that would supplement - and eventually replace - human-driven cars .
Uber has logged 2 million self-driving miles ( 3.2 million km ) through December . The company has more than 100 autonomous cars testing on the roads of the greater Phoenix area , the company 's prime testing ground due to the state 's loose regulations and hospitable weather . Rain , snow and ice are particularly challenging for autonomous cars . The company also tests in Pittsburgh and Toronto .
Concerns over the safety of autonomous vehicles flared after a July 2016 fatality involving a Tesla Inc automobile with a partially autonomous system that required human supervision . Safety regulators later determined Tesla was not at fault .
The Bank of Canada held its key interest rate target , but hinted that rate hikes
The Bank of Canada is seen in Ottawa on Wednesday , May 30 , 2018 . THE CANADIAN PRESS/Sean Kilpatrick
The Bank of Canada kept its key interest rate target on hold Wednesday , but hinted that rate hikes could be coming as it noted the Canadian economy was a little stronger than expected in the first quarter .
The central bank held steady its target for the overnight rate — a key financial benchmark that influences the prime lending rates at the country 's big banks — at 1.25 per cent .
A statement released with the decision noted that exports were more robust than forecast as data on imports of machinery and equipment suggest continued recovery in investment , but also pointed to softer real estate activity into the second quarter as the market ” continues to adjust to new mortgage guidelines and higher borrowing rates . ”
“ Going forward , solid labour income growth supports the expectation that housing activity will pick up and consumption will continue to contribute importantly to growth in 2018 , ” it said .
The central bank also said global economic activity remains broadly on track , but added that ongoing uncertainty about trade policies is dampening global business investment and stresses are developing in some emerging market economies .
It noted that recent developments have reinforced its view that higher rates will be warranted to keep inflation near its target , but added that it will take a gradual approach and be guided by the economic data .
“ In particular , the bank will continue to assess the economy 's sensitivity to interest rate movements and the evolution of economic capacity , ” it said .

Economists had predicted the Bank of Canada would keep its key rate on hold Wednesday , but many have suggested the rate may be headed higher later this year .
The central bank 's statement had “ a hawkish tone , suggesting the next rate hike is not far off , ” said TD Bank senior economist Brian DePratto .
“ All told , the positives seem to outweigh the negatives , ” DePratto wrote in a note to clients .
“ Gone was the reference to ‘ caution ' that typified the last few statements . Today 's statement instead chose the term ‘ gradual ' to describe the approach to policy adjustments . Importantly , interest rate sensitivity and the evolution of economic capacity remained areas of particular focus . ”
The central bank 's decision to keep its trend-setting rate on hold came as inflation sits above the two per cent midpoint of its target range of one to three per cent and core inflation has crept past the two per cent mark for the first time since 2012 .
It noted that inflation will likely be a bit higher in the near term than was forecast in its April monetary policy report due to recent increases in gasoline prices , but that it will look through the transitory impact of the fluctuations at the pump .
The central bank has raised its key rate three times since last summer , increases that have prompted the big Canadian banks to raise their prime rates which are used to set the rates charged for variable-rate mortgages and other variable-rate loans .
Its next scheduled interest rate decision is set for July 11 when it will also update its outlook for the economy and inflation in its monetary policy report .

WILMINGTON , Del . ( AP )  Delaware Gov . John Carney has settled on a person to lead an independent review of an uprising at a prison where four Department of Correction staffers were held hostage and one was killed .
Carney was scheduled to announce his selection Tuesday at his Wilmington office .
Officials have said the review will examine the immediate and underlying causes of the inmate uprising at James T. Vaughn Correctional Center earlier this month .
Administration officials said the review will start after the completion of a state police criminal investigation into the death of Lt. Steven Floyd , so as to not interfere with that probe . The Department of Correction also is conducting its own internal investigation .
Brynn Cartelli impressed coach Kelly Clarkson and advanced Monday night on NBC 's `` The Voice . ''
The Longmeadow High School freshman went head-to-head with Team Kelly teammate Dylan Hartigan in a duet of `` ... Ready For It '' by Taylor Swift .
Clarkson named her the winner of the battle .
Fellow `` Voice '' coach Adam Levine called Cartelli a star .
Do n't worry about Hartigan , coach Blake Shelton nabbed him for his team .
Cartelli wowed Clarkson and the critics during her Blind Audition , which was broadcast last month .
The Hollywood Reporter lauded her performance , writing that Cartelli showed `` a clear sense of artistry and a lot of versatility . ''
`` It 's overwhelming , '' Cartelli told The Republican , `` but I am enjoying every second of it because I know there are a lot of people who would like to be where I am now . ''
“ Wonder Woman ” no longer has to bear the burden of saving the box office — after two weekends on top , a new champ will take the reign .
“ Cars 3 , ” the third installment in the franchise from Disney and Pixar , should speed to the $ 55 million to $ 65 million range . That 's about the same as the first two movies which , combined , have made more than $ 435 million in the U.S. and $ 1 billion globally . The “ Cars ” films are far from Disney and Pixar 's highest earners , but “ Cars 3 ” should be another example that even a decent opening for the duo is a victory in the big picture .
So put this one in the win column for first-time director Brian Fee , who was a storyboard artist on the first two “ Cars ” films , as well as “ Ratatouille ” and “ Wall-E. ” The ensemble voice cast of “ Cars 3 ” includes Owen Wilson , Cristela Alonzo , Armie Hammer , Larry the Cable Guy , Bonnie Hunt , Nathan Fillion , Kerry Washington , and Lea DeLaria .
That means a step down for Warner Bros. ' “ Wonder Woman , ” which has proven to be a box office force . With strong holds throughout the week , the movie has already earned almost $ 450 million worldwide . If it sees a 40-45 % drop from last weekend 's $ 58.5 million , it will still have made enough to most likely hold onto second place over a pack of newcomers .
Starting with “ All Eyez on Me , ” the Tupac biopic from Lionsgate and Summit that is tracking in the $ 17 million to $ 22 million range , with the potential to earn more . Demetrius Shipp Jr. plays the mythologized rapper . Benny Bloom — who has two feature films and a long list of music videos on his resume — directed the film that explores Shakur 's origins , rise , and imprisonment . The release date aligns with what would have been Shakur 's 46th birthday .
There 's also “ Rough Night , ” a raunchy , fem-centric R-rated comedy from Sony that 's expected to earn in the low teens . The project combines the talents of director and co-writer Lucia Aniello , co-writer and actor Paul W. Downs , and star Ilana Glazer — the three are frequent collaborators on Comedy Central 's “ Broad City ” and “ Time Traveling Bong. ” Scarlett Johansson , Kate McKinnon , Jillian Bell , Zoe Kravitz , and Glazer make up a rowdy girl gang who reunite for a bachelorette weekend that — yes — goes horribly wrong .
That leaves “ 47 Meters Down , ” which — with an estimated $ 4 million to $ 6 million from 2,300 locations — does n't look to make much of a splash . It 's the first major release from Entertainment Studios , which acquired the project from its original distributor , Dimension Films . Mandy Moore and Claire Holt star as sisters who decide to go cage diving , and end up at risk of being attacked by sharks .
In limited release , Focus Features will launch “ The Book of Henry ” in 579 locations . Colin Trevorrow directed the Naomi Watts-starrer about a single mother who discovers her son is plotting to rescue a young girl from her abusive stepfather .
“ Wonder Woman ” has helped lift the summer box office from almost 10 % behind 2016 following Memorial Day weekend , to about even . This time last year “ Warcraft ” flopped domestically with $ 24 million and “ Conjuring 2 ” won with $ 40 million . The matchup to watch will be next weekend when “ Transformers : The Last Knight ” will debut , essentially uncontested , in the same slot that launched “ Finding Dory ” to $ 1 billion-plus last year .
Alabama GOP Senate Primary Tests Reach Of McConnell , Trump
Enlarge this image toggle caption Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images
In the Alabama Republican Senate race , every candidate wants to be just like Donald Trump .
But in Tuesday 's primary , the leading candidate sounds and acts more like the president , while it 's the incumbent , an appointed senator just fighting to make it into a likely runoff , who has Trump 's actual blessing — but also the curse of being Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell 's favorite candidate .
That 's the conundrum of the Republican contest , largely seen as a three-way race between front-runner Roy Moore , a controversial former Alabama Supreme Court chief justice ; Sen. Luther Strange , appointed back in February to fill the seat of now-Attorney General Jeff Sessions ; and Rep. Mo Brooks , who 's seized on an anti-McConnell platform as the president 's attacks against the Senate 's top Republican have intensified recently .
Moore has consistently polled atop the field , and looks likely to claim a spot in a probable September runoff . His ads sound downright Trumpian , promising to `` drain the swamp '' and taking a swipe at D.C. elites .
YouTube
Moore is well-known throughout the state — and the country — too . He first gained national notoriety when he refused to remove a monument of the Ten Commandments from a state judicial building despite a federal court order ; Moore himself was then removed from his position as chief justice of the Alabama Supreme Court in 2003 . He won election to the same post again in 2012 , but was then suspended after he ordered judges to enforce the state 's ban on same-sex marriage despite the Supreme Court 's 2015 decision in favor of gay marriage nationwide under the federal Constitution . He resigned earlier this year to challenge Strange .
To state observers , it 's not surprising that Moore has been able to build a strong following and even expand beyond what might be his typical conservative base in the state .
`` Alabama voters supported Trump because he spoke his mind and said all the things they had been thinking about government , '' said Brent Buchanan , a GOP strategist and pollster in the state . `` Out of all the candidates , Roy Moore has some of those similar characteristics . You may not agree with all of his policy or personal preferences , but you know that Roy Moore is going to do what Roy Moore believes . ''
That 's why it was so , well , strange last week when Trump tweeted out his support for Strange , saying the incumbent has his `` complete and total endorsement ! ''
The senator has benefited from millions of dollars in ads from the McConnell-aligned Senate Leadership Fund super PAC . The very next day after endorsing Strange , Trump started going on Twitter tirades against the GOP Senate leader for failing to pass a bill to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act .
Strange has tried to prove his loyalty to the president ever since he was appointed under less than auspicious circumstances . As Alabama 's attorney general , Strange was investigating then-Gov . Robert Bentley for misuse of his office amid a sex scandal when Bentley chose Strange to replace Sessions . Facing impeachment , Bentley eventually resigned , and the new governor , Kay Ivey , moved up the date for the special election to replace Sessions long-term .
Polling done in the wake of Trump 's surprise endorsement showed that the president 's blessing had done little — yet — to move the needle toward Strange . One by cygnal , Buchanan 's firm , conducted partly after the endorsement , showed Moore still with a lead and high favorables , Strange remained static and it was Brooks who took a hit .
Buchanan said the Trump endorsement could help Strange turn out some who were less likely to vote on Tuesday , which could be key in what 's already expected to be a very low-turnout affair .
And the pro-Trump America First Action super PAC also announced late Friday it would be spending up to $ 200,000 on digital ads targeting Trump voters to encourage them to come out for Strange .
However , although he 's slipping in polling , Brooks is hoping to turn McConnell 's fervent support for Strange into a last-ditch way to get into the likely runoff against Moore . He 's hitched a `` Ditch Mitch '' banner to his campaign bus in the final days , and in his closing ad he echoes Trump 's frustration with McConnell 's inability to push through an Obamacare repeal .
`` McConnell and Strange are weak , but together we can be strong , '' Brooks says . `` Mr. President , is n't it time we tell McConnell and Strange , 'You 're fired ? ' ''
YouTube
Ultimately , the Huntsville-area congressman has n't had the resources the other two candidates have had , and he has n't been elected statewide before like Moore and Strange . And , perhaps most damaging , he was certainly no fan of Trump during the GOP presidential primaries last year , during which he supported Texas Sen. Ted Cruz . McConnell 's super PAC has pointed that out in ads , saying Brooks sided with House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi , D-Calif. , and Sen. Elizabeth Warren , D-Mass .
YouTube
If Strange does fall short of the runoff , University of Alabama political science professor emeritus William Stewart , a longtime political observer in the state , said that 's a big problem for McConnell . And , if Strange does make it to the likely September runoff , expect that to be a big point Moore can use against Strange , too .
`` The McConnell support for Strange will not be helpful because McConnell , as the president says , has n't been successful at pushing through the president 's agenda , `` Stewart said . `` If Strange does n't make the runoff , that 's a definite blow to McConnell , '' more so than Trump .
Polling shows Moore is still the favorite against Strange in a runoff , and that 's where the McConnell ties could be the most deadly — and place the president in a more precarious spot given his surprising endorsement . Stewart said it would be interesting to watch how much Trump puts his muscle behind Strange later , and something like traveling to Alabama — one of Trump 's best states in 2016 — for a rally on the senator 's behalf would certainly give Strange a boost .
No matter who wins the GOP nomination though , they 'll be the heavy favorite in the December general election , even if it 's the more controversial Moore . Democrats are expected to nominate Doug Jones , a former U.S. attorney , though he could face a runoff against the aptly-named Robert Kennedy Jr. , a Naval veteran who is not related to the famous Democratic political family .
If Moore is the GOP nominee , it will be interesting to watch whether the Democrats can make it even a mildly competitive contest — something Stewart , the former University of Alabama professor , said is doubtful , and is emblematic of the problems the party faces overall in the South .
`` Right now the Democratic Party is very impotent here , '' Stewart said . `` I think whomever the Republicans choose as their nominee will be the winner . ''
Scotland Yard has received two new complaints of sexual assault against Harvey Weinstein from one woman .
The first incident is alleged to have taken place in Westminster in 2011 , and the second outside of the jurisdiction of the U.K. in 2010 . The complaints were lodged Nov. 13 , and according to Scotland Yard , the information for the second complaint will be passed to the relevant authorities .
The new allegations bring the total number of accusations against Weinstein from outside the United States to 14 , from nine separate women . The claims are being investigated by Scotland Yard under Operation Kaguyak .
No arrests have been made . Per Scotland Yard policy , no further information was given .
The allegations ' revelation comes on the heels of a revealing article in the New York Times describing an alleged assault by Weinstein on Uma Thurman . Thurman describes the incident that allegedly took place in the Savoy Hotel in London , where Weinstein “ pushed me down . He tried to shove himself on me . He tried to expose himself . He did all kinds of unpleasant things . But he did n't actually put his back into it and force me . ”
BAFTA also recently terminated Weinstein 's membership after suspending it in October . “ The termination is the result of a process laid out in BAFTA 's constitution , ” the organization said .

Marnie Simpson has lashed out at ex boyfriend Lewis Bloor - and cleared up that Dubai row over a missing bank card .
The Geordie Shore star was filmed having a blazing fight with ex TOWIE castmember Lewis during their sunshine holiday at the start of the month and was caught on camera accusing him of taking her bank card .
But writing in her Star magazine column , Marnie admitted there had been a mix up and Lewis did n't have her bank card , although she firmly believed he did at the time of the argument .
“ We 'd been drinking all afternoon and had been arguing for a good hour , ” she wrote .

“ To clear things up , Lewis did n't steal my bank card . I thought he 'd taken it so I could n't storm out of the hotel . I was so angry . ”
Marnie then went on to talk about her Twitter spat with Lewis , which came after they 'd returned to the UK .
Lewis retweeted an old message he 'd posted about Marnie a few months previously , while she was filming Geordie Shore , which read : `` Spoke to my lovely gf today really cheered me up . Shes ok .. i can imagine its tough living with exes .. cant wait to get my arms round her '' . [ sic ]
But after watching last week 's episode of Geordie Shore , he had added as a caption to the old tweet : `` How jokes when i tweeted this and she was doing that ... what a mug . # PotKettle '' [ sic ]
Marnie hit back at him , replying : `` U we 're tweeting me when u were s * * gging every Tom dick and harry ! R u crazy . '' [ sic ]
( Photo : WENN )
She wrote in her magazine column : “ The night we got back , he tweeted s * * t about me on Geordie Shore .
`` Let 's just say if people knew the truth of what 's gone on and how Lewis has treated me , it would ruin him . But I could n't do that to him , even though he deserves it .
`` Karma will do my dirty work for me . ”
Meanwhile , Marnie also said that starring in her own reality TV show with Lewis could make things easier in a way , as it would allow people to see what really happened behind the headlines .

She made the comments while discussing Kylie Jenner 's new E ! solo show
`` I bet Kim [ Kardashian ] is jealous as she 's never had her own show . I reckon Kylie will be bigger than Kim ever was , '' said Marnie .
`` I would love my own reality show . It would make situations like the argument with Lewis easier , because people could see what really happened . ''

Marnie and Lewis went on a sun-drenched break to Dubai in March , in order to `` cure '' for any ill-feelings following their split in February .
But it would seem that cordial relations between Marnie and Lewis did n't manage to hold up for very long , as they were captured having an EXPLOSIVE row whilst on holiday just hours later .
In a Snapchat video obtained by Mirror Online , the 25-year-old Geordie Shore star can be seen hurling abuse at her ex-boyfriend , 27 , in a bar at the luxury Waldorf Astoria hotel .

In the footage , captured by another holidaymaker , the fiery Northerner can be seen storming out into a patio area , screaming and shouting at Lewis before she appears to aggressively move towards him and land a slap .
`` No , no , no , you 've got my bank card . He 's got my bank card , ” Marnie yells at two pals who are sat with Lewis .
After someone from the party replies , she can be heard saying : `` Yes you do , you do , you do have it . You 've just left me upstairs on my own . I f * * * ing hate you ! ''

Following the altercation in which a friend looks to hold Marnie back while trying to placate the situation , a shirtless Lewis can be seen getting up and walking away .
A witness to the row told The Sun Online that it looked as though Marnie had thrown wine over the former TOWIE star , which would explain his reason for being shirtless .
And it would seem their were some repercussions for out-burst as the on-looker told the website : `` Plain clothed police officers took him aside and her inside away from each other and escorted them out .
( Photo : WENN.com )
`` It 's a very nice hotel and it was a very big scene .
`` There was about 15 other people along the balcony all watching it going on . ''
The explosive row , which is believed to have taken place at 8:30pm on Sunday , came just hours after Marnie had taken to Instagram on Sunday afternoon - telling her followers how the exes had been working on their frienship .
A tanned Marnie told fans that while she was not dating Lewis again , the holiday had been a chance for them to repair and restart their friendship .
Posing alongside an equally tanned Lewis , Marnie said : “ Just to set the record straight this was a holiday for me and Lewis to get away from all the stress and salvage some sort of friendship . A friendship we lost along the way .
“ We 're not back together and that 's not what this holiday was about , it was to talk and get to a good place again as we both have big places for each other in our hearts and , despite the hard times and damage , we still have a bond like no other and always have a great time in each other 's company , even if it 's just as mates .
“ That wont change regardless of our situation , Just because we 're not a couple does n't mean we do n't love other as I think we always will deep down , I thank you Dubai . You 've been the cure .
“ PS . We both have A BATHING SUIT ON . ”

No doubt that 's music to Sophie Kasaei 's ears , as the Geordie Shore star - who is Marnie 's cousin - had expressed concern about the star jetting off on holiday with her ex .
“ I 've seen pictures of Lewis and Marnie at the airport and I know they 're away on holiday together , ” Sophie had written in her New magazine column .
“ I do n't really know what to say about it to be honest . I feel like all the advice I give her ... if she 's not going to listen to me , then she 's not going to listen to anyone . ”
Marnie split from Lewis after reports he 'd been unfaithful .
She admitted last month she 'd struggled with whether to give their relationship another chance .
“ Nothing has changed with Lewis . We 're speaking , but I still do n't know what to do , ” she wrote in her Star magazine column .
“ I love him , but I 'm worried he 'd cheat again . ”

Marnie adds : “ I was n't perfect either . I did n't behave like a lady or an appropriate girlfriend when I was filming Geordie Shore , and that embarrasses him . ”
Lewis admitted to kissing another woman during a romantic holiday with Marnie - but claimed Marnie had `` humiliated '' him by flirting with another man .
She denied that .
She told Mirror Celebs : `` I bumped into someone I had kissed prior to meeting Lewis and I was a little tipsy by no means all over him .
`` Maybe over friendly perhaps but certainly not all over over him . I have never cheated , would n't cheat and did n't deserve to be cheated on for this . ''

But he ruled out the likelihood of the show hunting for a new version of his own band , Spandau Ballet .
He said : “ We are in very early stage discussions about a Spandau Ballet musical , but I think it 's unlikely Let It Shine would be part of that . ”

The F-22 upgrade allows full functionality for the AIM-120D and AIM-9X Air-to-Air missiles as well as enhanced Air-to-Surface target location capabilities .
The Air Force is in the early phases of designing new sensors for its stealthy 5th-generation F-22 Raptor as it proceeds with software upgrades , hardware adjustments , new antennas and data link improvements designed to better enable to connect the F-22 and F-35 sensor packages to one another , industry officials explained .
Sensor interoperability , two-way data links and other kinds of technical integration between the two 5th-Gen stealth aircraft are considered key to an Air Force combat strategy which intends for the F-22 speed and air-to-air combat supremacy to complement and work in tandem with the F-35 's next-gen sensors , precision-attack technology , computers and multi-role fighting mission ability .
`` The F-22 is designed to fly in concert with F-35 . Software Update 6 for the F-22 will give the Air Force a chance to link their sensor packages together . Sensors are a key component to its capability . As the F-22 gets its new weapons on board – you are going to need to upgrade the sensors to use the new weapons capability , '' John Cottam , F-22 Program Deputy , Lockheed Martin Aeronautics , told Scout Warrior in an interview .
While the F-35 is engineered with dog-fighting abilities , its advanced sensor technology is intended to recognize enemy threats at much further distances - enabling earlier , longer-range attacks to destroy enemies in the air . Such technologies , which include 360-degree sensors known as Northrop Grumman 's Distributed Aperture System and a long range Electro-Optical Targeting System , are designed to give the F-35 an ability to destroy targets at much longer ranges - therefore precluding the need to dogfight .
Like the F-35 , the latest F-22s have radar ( Synthetic Aperture Radar ) and data-links ( F-22 has Linked 16 ) , radar warning receivers and targeting technologies . Being that the F-22 is regarded as the world 's best air-to-air platform , an ability for an F-35 and F-22 to more quickly exchange sensor information such as targeting data would produce a potentially unprecedented battlefield advantage , industry developers and Air Force senior leaders have explained . The combined impact of each of the airplanes respective technological advantages makes for an unrivaled air-combat supremacy , observers have argued .
For example , either of the aircraft could use stealth technology to penetrate enemy airspace and destroy air defense systems . Once a safe air corridor is established for further attacks , an F-22 could maintain or ensure continued air supremacy while an F-35 conducted close-air-support ground attacks or pursued ISR missions with its drone-like video-surveillance technology . Additionally , either platform could identify targets for the other , drawing upon the strengths of each .
Conversely , an F-35 could use its long-range sensors and `` sensor fusion '' to identify airborne targets which the F-22 may be best suited to attack .
Air Force developers are , quite naturally , acutely aware of the Chinese J-20 stealth fighter and Russia 's PAK-FA T-50 stealth aircraft as evidence that the US will need to work vigorously to sustain its technological edge .
Along these lines , both the F-22 and F-35 are engineered to draw from `` mission data files , '' described as on-board libraries storing information on known threats in particular geographical locations . This database is integrated into a radar warning receiver so that aircraft have the earliest possible indication of the threats they are seeing .
Air Force officials have told Scout Warrior that , by 2019 , the service will begin upgrading F-22 functionality for the AIM-120D and AIM-9X Air-to-Air missiles as well as enhanced Air-to-Surface target location capabilities . The F-22 currently carries the AIM-9X Block 1 and the current upgrade will enable carriage of AIM-9X Block 2 .
Raytheon AIM-9X weapons developers explain that the Block 2 variant adds a redesigned fuze and a digital ignition safety device that enhances ground handling and in-flight safety . Block II also features updated electronics that enable significant enhancements , including lock-on-after-launch capability using a new weapon datalink to support beyond visual range engagements , a Raytheon statement said .
Another part of the weapons upgrade includes engineering the F-22 to fire the AIM-120D , a beyond visual range Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missile ( AMRAAM ) , designed for all weather day-and-night attacks ; it is a `` fire and forget '' missile with active transmit radar guidance , Raytheon data states . The AIM-120D is built with upgrades to previous AMRAAM missiles by increasing attack range , GPS navigation , inertial measurment units and a two-way data link , Raytheon statements explain .
As the Air Force and Lockheed Martin move forward with weapons envelope expansions and enhancements for the F-22 , there is of course a commensurate need to upgrade software and its on-board sensors to adjust to emerging future threats , industry developers explained . Ultimately , this effort will lead the Air Force to draft up requirements for new F-22 sensors .
Cottam also explained that the House and Senate have directed the Air Force to look at two different potential sensor upgrades for the F-22 , an effort the service is now in the conceptual phase of exploring .
`` A sensor enhancement program is now being configured . We do not know what that is going to entail because it is not yet funded by the Air Force and we have not seen a requirements documents , '' Cottam said . `` Threats in the world are always evolving so we need to evolve this plane as well . ''
An essential software adjustment , called “ Update 6 , ” is now being worked on by Lockheed Martin engineers on contract with the Air Force . Work on the software is slated to be finished by 2020 , Cottam added .
A hardware portion of the upgrades , called a “ tactical mandate , ” involves engineering new antennas specifically designed to preserve the stealth configuration of the F-22 .
“ New antennas have to be first constructed . They will be retrofitted onto the airplane . Because of the stealth configuration putting , antennas on is difficult and time consuming , ” Cottam said .
Meanwhile , the Air Force is performing key maintenance on the F-22 Raptor 's stealth materials while upgrading the stealth fighter with new attack weapons to include improved air-to-air and air-to-surface strike technology , service officials said .
The AIM-120D also includes improved High-Angle Off-Boresight technology enabling the weapon to destroy targets at a wider range of angles .
Additional upgrades to the stealth fighter , slated for 2021 , are designed to better enable digital communications via data links with 4th and 5th generation airplanes .
`` The backbone of this upgrade also includes the installation of an open systems architecture that will allow for future upgrades to be done faster and at less expense than could be previously accomplished , '' 1st Lt. Carrie J. Volpe , Action Officer , Air Combat Command Public Affair , Joint Base Langley-Eustis , Va. , told Scout Warrior .
Stealth Coating Maintenance
The Air Force has contracted Lockheed Martin to perform essential maintenance to the F-22 's low-observable stealth coating to ensure it is equipped to manage fast-emerging threats .
Lockheed Martin completed the first F-22 Raptor at the company 's Inlet Coating Repair ( ICR ) Speedline , a company statement said .
`` Periodic maintenance is required to maintain the special exterior coatings that contribute to the 5th Generation Raptor 's Very Low Observable radar cross-section , '' Lockheed stated .
The increase in F-22 deployments , including ongoing operational combat missions , has increased the demand for ICR . Additionally , Lockheed Martin is providing modification support services , analytical condition inspections , radar cross-section turntable support and antenna calibration .
F-22 Attack & Supercruise Technology
At the moment , targeting information from drones is relayed from the ground station back up to an F-22 . However , computer algorithms and technology is fast evolving such that aircraft like an F-22s will soon be able to quickly view drone video feeds in the cockpit without needing a ground station -- and eventually be able to control nearby drones from the air . These developments were highlighted in a special Scout Warrior interview with Air Force Chief Scientist Greg Zacharias .
U.S. Air Force
Zacharias explained that fifth generation fighters such as the F-35 and F-22 are quickly approaching an ability to command-and-control nearby drones from the air . This would allow unmanned systems to deliver payload , test enemy air defenses and potentially extend the reach of ISR missions .
Newer F-22s have a technology called Synthetic Aperture Radar , or SAR , which uses electromagnetic signals or “ pings ” to deliver a picture or rendering of the terrain below , allow for better target identification .
The SAR technology sends a ping to the ground and then analyzes the return signal to calculate the contours , distance and characteristics of the ground below .
Overall , the Air Force operates somewhere between 80 and 100 or more F-22s . Dave Majumdar of The National Interest writes that many would like to see more F-22s added to the Air Force arsenal . ( Story HERE ) . For instance , some members of Congress , such as former Rep. Randy Forbes , R-Va. , have requested that more F-22s be built , given its technological superiority .
Citing budget concerns , Air Force officials have said it is unlikely the service will want to build new F-22s , however it is possible the Trump administration could want to change that .
F-22 Technologies
The F-22 is known for a range of technologies including an ability called “ super cruise ” which enables the fighter to reach speeds of Mach 1.5 without needing to turn on its after burners .
“ The F-22 engines produce more thrust than any current fighter engine . The combination of sleek aerodynamic design and increased thrust allows the F-22 to cruise at supersonic airspeeds . Super Cruise greatly expands the F-22 's operating envelope in both speed and range over current fighters , which must use fuel-consuming afterburner to operate at supersonic speeds , ” Col. Larry Broadwell , the Commander of the 1st Operations Group at Joint Base Langley-Eustis , Virginia , told Scout Warrior in a special pilot interview last year .
The fighter jet fires a 20mm cannon and has the ability to carry and fire all the air-to-air and air-to-ground weapons including precision-guided ground bombs , such Joint Direct Attack Munitions called the GBU 32 and GBU 39 , Broadwell explained . In the air-to-air configuration the Raptor carries six AIM-120 AMRAAMs and two AIM-9 Sidewinders , he added .
“ The F-22 possesses a sophisticated sensor suite allowing the pilot to track , identify , shoot and kill air-to-air threats before being detected . Significant advances in cockpit design and sensor fusion improve the pilot 's situational awareness , ” he said .
It also uses what 's called a radar-warning receiver – a technology which uses an updateable data base called “ mission data files ” to recognize a wide-range of enemy fighters , Broadwell said .
Made by Lockheed Martin and Boeing , the F-22 uses two Pratt & Whitney F119-PW-100 turbofan engines with afterburners and two-dimensional thrust vectoring nozzles , an Air Force statement said . It is 16-feet tall , 62-feet long and weighs 43,340 pounds . Its maximum take-off weight is 83,500 .
The aircraft was first introduced in December of 2005 , and each plane costs $ 143 million , Air Force statements say .
“ Its greatest asset is the ability to target attack and kill an enemy without the enemy ever being aware they are there , ” Broadwell added .
The Air Force 's stealthy F-22 Raptor fighter jet delivered some of the first strikes in the U.S.-led attacks on the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria , when aerial bombing began in 2014 , service officials told Scout Warrior .
After delivering some of the first strikes in the U.S. Coalition-led military action against ISIS , the F-22 began to shift its focus from an air-dominance mission to one more focused on supporting attacks on the ground .
`` An F-22 squadron led the first strike in OIR ( Operation Inherent Resolve ) . The aircraft made historic contributions in the air-to-ground regime , ” he added .
Even though ISIS does not have sophisticated air defenses or fighter jets of their own to challenge the F-22 , there are still impactful ways in which the F-22 continues to greatly help the ongoing attacks , Broadwell said .
“ There are no issues with the air superiority mission . That is the first thing they focus on . After that , they can transition to what they have been doing over the last several months and that has been figuring out innovative ways to contribute in the air-to-ground regime to support the coalition , ” Broadwell said .
ISLAMABAD , Oct 6 ( APP ) : Minister for Defence Engineer
Khurram Dastgir Khan on Friday said Pakistan wanted reality based
relations with United States ( US ) and to work jointly against terrorism .
Talking to a private news channel , the minister said foreign
minister Khawaja Muhammad Asif had clearly presented Pakistan 's
stance in the US .
He said the US was present in the Afghanistan from last 16 years
but failed to establish peace there , adding American army
general had admitted that they had not complete control on the
Afghanistan 's land .
He said the US army had failed to restore peace in Iraq and
Afghanistan and wanted safe exit from Afghanistan but blaming
others for its failure .
Khurram Dastgir said US policy regarding Afghanistan was not
clear and no one was aware about its objectives for that country .
He said it was needed to assure US that India was still
an existing threat for Pakistan .
Replying to a question , he said Pakistan had started fencing
for securing its western border and Afghanistan should also do
the same and should initiate some concrete steps in this regard otherwise terrorism
would not be controlled properly in Afghanistan .
He said Pakistan had been fighting war against terrorism and
achieved a lot of success in it through operation Zarb-e-Azb and
Radd-ul-Fasaad .
Verizon recently announced its new unlimited data plan which costs $ 80 per month . The plan was designed to compete with their rival T-Mobile 's ONE unlimited data plan which costs $ 70 per month . Verizon sets itself apart from T-Mobile by giving a 10GB of tethering data per month with a full HD video streaming to customers .
Verizon 's offer spurred T-Mobile which leads for T-Mobile to find ways to compete with its competitor 's offer . According to AppleNWS , T-Mobile CEO John Legere announced that all T-Mobile ONE subscriber could also stream HD video as well as get a 10GB high-speed data with no extra charges .
T-Mobile 's CEO has also announced the promotion that offers two lines with unlimited data for $ 100 per month to their customers . The standard price point is $ 120 . However , the company is planning to give a discount of $ 20 , and that makes $ 100 instead of $ 120 .

The current $ 70 plan only limits the streaming video quality to 480p and caps mobile hotspot speed at 512kbps despite the fact that customers could already pay extra for the HD video and high-speed tethering .
According to The Verge , after Verizon 's announcement , the plan immediately offered an unlimited hotspot data which was limited to 2G speeds . In this plan , customers have an option to pay for the 5GB of data for the additional $ 15 per month .
T-Mobile ONE is also planning to limit subscribers to 480p `` optimized '' video for free through its Binge On program . With this , users can now stream Binge On content with a higher resolution by default .
The company , however , did not give any specific details on the new resolution which is expected to be available to ONE subscriber . According to some users , HD usually equates to 720p . The implementation of HD video on the plan is little cumbersome because it is not automatically enabled even if customers offer an extra pay for it .
For now , T-Mobile `` One Plus '' plan includes unlimited HD day passes . Customers who want a higher definition video can switch to HD video .
What Tony Hull is pulling off at Kansas Jayhawks is not rocket science . The man knows rocket science . Recruiting is much easier than rocket science .
The shock over what he and David Beaty have pulled off so far is understandable . A staff that 's 2-22 in two seasons is not supposed to land commitments from elite recruits , but that 's what Kansas is doing . The Jayhawks already have seven pledges for 2018 , two from ESPN Junior 300 standouts .
That 's right , Kansas has the ( extremely ) early No . 1 recruiting class in the Big 12 . Hull , a second-year assistant Beaty hired straight out of the Louisiana high school ranks , brought in five of those pledges . He 's enjoying any outrage or suspicion those gets have evoked .
“ You 've got all these conspiracy theories and all this craziness , ” Hull said . “ It 's like , man , do people realize I was a high school coach a year ago ?
“ It 's spending hours on the phone with kids late at night when they come home from practice . Instead of going home and watching TV , I 'm in the office on the phone with parents and kids trying to develop relationships . ”
Kansas assistant Tony Hull has helped Kansas reel in two ESPN Junior 300 recruits already in the 2018 class . University of Kansas athletics
The long rebuild in progress at Kansas is n't at all daunting to an assistant who built New Orleans ' Warren Easton Charter High School football from the bottom up . He restarted their program in 2007 , two years after the devastation of Hurricane Katrina , with a team of 45 resilient kids . Only three had ever played high school football . He started off with a staff of seven . Only two had ever coached high school football .
“ So all the athletes had already gone to other schools , ” Hull said . “ We started from scratch . We had to develop as coaches while we were developing kids . ”
This immense challenge felt like a calling to Hull , so much so that he 'd walked away from his previous career as an industrial engineer . He was making good money at a subsidiary of NASA , working for three years on the massive orange external fuel tanks that provide the backbone of space shuttles during launch .
Somehow , Hull pulled it all off . By 2014 , Warren Easton was playing in the 4A state championship game in the Superdome . Warren Easton produced 45 future Division I players during his tenure , including ESPN 's No . 1 recruit in Louisiana for 2015 ( Oklahoma State WR Tyron Johnson ) and eight Power 5 signees in his last two years .
“ If you told an average person their story , it would be very , very hard for most folks to not get emotional when they hear it , ” Beaty said . “ It 's that cool of a story and a rebuild . He always just did what was best for his kids . ”
When college job offers rolled in after the 2015 season , Hull said working for Beaty as Kansas ' running backs coach just felt right . He found a head coach who matched his passion for raising young men on and off the field . Leaving Warren Easton was one of the hardest things he 's ever done , but this job provides another way to give back to New Orleans .
“ I 'm able to give kids an opportunity they might not have if I was n't at a Big 12 school , ” Hull said .
He 'd never visited Lawrence , Kansas , prior to his job interview . He was wowed by the warm embrace of a supportive college community . He says that 's the No . 1 reason why Louisiana kids should make the nearly 700 mile moves north . The people of Kansas make his sell so much easier .
So does the success of players like Mike Lee . The New Orleans native was supposed to be a four-star safety in the 2017 recruiting class . He instead made the rare move to enroll at Kansas a year early . He became one of the Big 12 's most productive freshmen in a year when he should 've been a high school senior .
“ You could n't get him to say two words before he got to KU . He never talked , ” Hull said . “ Now he 's outspoken and articulate and he 's great in the community . Parents of New Orleans see that and love that . ”
It will take a few more Louisiana kids shining for Hull to maintain this pipeline he 's building . The Jayhawks already have Lee , Alabama transfer WR Daylon Charlot and backup QB Tyriek Starks ( a Warren Easton grad ) , plus incoming freshmen Travis Jordan and Takulve Williams . Hull hopes they help more kids realize they can leave SEC country and still thrive .
What the staff pulled off at their Feb. 4 junior day was a stunning sign of progress . Kansas landed pledges from ESPN 300 prospects WR Devonta Jason and DB Corione Harris , teammates at Landry Walker High in New Orleans . They landed RB Anthony Williams , DB Aaron Brule and DT Nelson Jenkins out of Louisiana soon after .
Beaty recently rewarded Hull for all his hard work with a promotion to associate head coach and a $ 250,000 raise . Hull is quick to praise Beaty and the rest of Kansas ' coaching staff at every turn for the early recruiting success .
Yes , there 's still a long , long road to signing day . Hull knows he 's going to have to fight all year long to hold on to his kids . One ESPN 300 Louisiana recruit who committed at KU 's junior day , JaMarr Chase , reopened his recruitment on Sunday , citing a need to get everybody in his family “ on the same page. ” Keeping the rest will be challenging , no doubt .
“ I love the thrill of competition , ” Hull said . “ I got this job by competing . We were able to survive the natural disasters that hit the state of Louisiana by surviving and competing . So I 'm thrilled to be able to compete with other schools and other recruiters in Louisiana to get kids to come to KU . ”
FILE PHOTO : Musicians Petula Clark ( R ) and Tony Hatch perform during the 44th Annual Songwriters Hall of Fame ceremony in New York June 13 , 2013 .
CROPREDY , England ( Reuters ) - Grammy award-winner Petula Clark sang her global hit `` Downtown '' about as far from `` where the neon signs are pretty '' as she could at the weekend -- to thousands in a field in rural England .
It was the 84-year-old 's first outdoor festival in a career spanning , well , eight decades .
`` I 'm always trying new things , '' she told Reuters .
Clark 's set at the Fairport Cropredy Convention included some of her other '60s hits , including `` Colour My World '' , `` I know a Place '' and `` Do n't Sleep in the Subway '' , but also new songs from her latest album `` From Now On '' .
`` This is not an old '60s thing by any means , I do n't do ... looking back , '' she said .
Indeed , she is working on a new album of French-Canadian songs ahead of a tour next May .
As might be expected , Clark closed her Cropredy show with her biggest hit , `` Downtown '' , leading the crowd as they sang along with the chorus .
`` Downtown '' topped the U.S . Billboard Hot 100 in 1964 , reached number two in the UK chart , won Clark her first Grammy and was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 2003 .
Clark , whose career stretches back to World War Two , when she sang on BBC radio to entertain British troops aged nine , has never shied from breaking new ground .

In the 1950s , she moved to Paris and recorded numerous songs in French , working over the years with the likes of Jacques Brel , Serge Gainsbourg and Charles Aznavour . Her website lists 10 `` gold record '' singles that have sold a million copies , including one each in French and German .
She has appeared in numerous films , including singing and dancing with Fred Astaire in 1968 's `` Finian 's Rainbow '' directed by Francis Ford Coppola .
The same year , in a U.S. TV special , she sang a duet with African-American singer and civil rights activist Harry Belafonte . As they sang the anti-war song `` On the Path of Glory '' co-written by Clark , she touched his arm -- to the dismay of the show 's sponsors .
A white woman touching a black man on television was taboo in the 1960s America .
To head off the sponsors , Clark 's team destroyed all other takes .
`` We were not going to be told what to do and what not to do , '' she said . `` Maybe I was naive . It seemed to me like a storm in a teacup but of course it was that particular time in that particular country . ''
A U.S. tour in November and December takes Clark from California to New York . Then she plays eight dates in French Canada , where she will perform in French .
So no plans to slow down ?
`` Not at the moment . My voice is in great shape . I do n't really do anything to help it , I just go out and do it , '' she said .
Nathan Fisher 's Paris-based banner Stray Dogs has acquired international sales rights to Johannes Nyholm 's “ Koko Di Kodo Da , ” the up-and-coming Swedish director 's follow up to his feature debut “ The Giant . ”
Weaving reality and fantasy as ” The Giant , ” “ Koko Di Kodo Da ” follows a couple who goes on a trip to find their way back to each other a few years after the tragic death of their only child . But the couple ends up reliving a traumatic night over and over again while camping . The story , told through their mutual dreams , is about relationships , grief and love as a healing force .
“ The setting is those wee hours of the morning when dreams are at their most relentlessly untamed . “ Koko-di Koko-da ” was both written and takes place during such a time – this nightmarish landscape between wakefulness and sleep , ” said Nyholm .
The director said he wanted the film to show “ everyday situations and power struggles lurking beneath the surface in relationships ; what is not said , what is embedded between the lines . ”
Fisher , a fan of elevated genre films , described “ Koko Di Kodo Da ” as a “ nightmarish ‘ Groundhog Day , ' a dreamy tale of dark woods and a universal narrative about a relationship that is falling apart . ”

“ Scandinavia is one of the most interesting places these days in terms of filmmaking , and Johannes is definitely one of the most powerful , original and sophisticated voices in that region , ” added Fisher , who discovered the project and met Nyholm at Les Arcs Festival 's industry village in 2016 . The project was pitched the year before at Goteborg .
Nyholm made his feature debut with “ The Giant , ” a fantasy-filled drama which world premiered at Toronto and went on to play at San Sebastian along with a flurry of festivals . The movie , about a deformed autistic man who tries to win a pétanque championship while dreaming of being a powerful titan , won three Guldbagge Awards , Sweden 's equivalent to the Oscars , and won prizes at San Sebastian , Rotterdam and Warsaw film festivals .
The Swedish helmer previously directed three shorts , “ Las Palmas , ” “ Dreams from the Woods ” and “ The Tale of Little Puppetboy ” which played at Cannes 's Directors Fortnight . “ Las Palmas ” had also played at Sundance .
MUMBAI/BENGALURU ( Reuters ) - India has raised the price at which the government will buy new- season common rice variety from domestic farmers by 13 percent , said Home Minister Rajnath Singh , as the state looks to woo farmers ahead of general elections due next year .

India , one of the world 's key producers of an array of farm commodities , announces support prices for more than 20 crops each year to set a benchmark .
Prime Minister Narendra Modi 's government said in its February budget that it would buy crops at 1.5 times the cost of production , a major shift after keeping the so-called minimum support price in low single digits over the past three years .
Analysts and economists have warned the move could help push up inflation , add to the fiscal deficit and prompt India 's central bank to raise interest rates more steeply than expected .
INDRANIL PAN , GROUP ECONOMIST , IDFC BANK , MUMBAI
“ It is too early to evaluate the implication of the minimum support price ( MSP ) hikes on inflation . We will have to wait till October-November to see the reality in terms of markets prices vs MSP to gauge inflationary impact . The announcement of MSP increase is unlikely to change the reaction function of the Reserve Bank of India ( RBI ) immediately , as core inflation , oil and currency will be key factors to drive the timing and extent of rate hikes . We expect the RBI to hike rates in August as well as in October due to the high core inflation and oil prices . ”
FORAM PAREKH , FUNDAMENTAL ANALYST - EQUITY , INDIABULLS VENTURES , MUMBAI
“ The hikes are very much in line with expectations . If the market side increases prices more than the MSPs , then it might lead to an inflationary situation . If farmers do get the benefit of the MSP hike , then the NBFC and automobile sectors would benefit due to rural income rising . Over the years , MSP has been revised by the government , but I do n't think the quoted price has reached the farmers . So it 's a wait-and-watch situation . We would only come to know if the farmers are actually getting it in the month of October .
“ Due to the rise in MSPs , the government would have to bear expenses of about 330 billion rupees ( $ 4.81 billion ) . It contributes not more than 0.2 pct-0.3 pct of the GDP . I think it is a very minimal number and should not impact the economy as a whole . The major dent the economy would face is from rising crude prices . ”
ADITI NAYAR , PRINCIPAL ECONOMIST , ICRA LTD , MUMBAI
“ Without further details on whether the procurement of crops would be widened from the current set , or if another mechanism would be adopted to ensure that farmers receive prices at par with MSPs for their produce , it remains difficult to ascertain the impact of higher MSPs on inflation and fiscal deficit .
“ Some of the items that have seen the biggest increases in MSPs for the ongoing kharif season , such as jowar , bajra , ragi and moong , have a small weight in the WPI and CPI indices . This may help to contain the inflationary impact , if higher MSPs translate to higher market prices .
“ Nevertheless , it is difficult to envision a scenario in which the recently announced hike in MSPs actually translates into higher realizations for farmers , without an increase in prices for the end-consumers or costs for the central and state governments through higher procurement costs and subsidy bill . ”
UPASNA BHARDWAJ , SENIOR ECONOMIST , KOTAK MAHINDRA BANK , MUMBAI
“ Most of the wholesale prices are higher than the mininum support price . How that translates into market prices will be a function of how exactly the implementation of these MSPs would be . At this point , it is difficult to gauge exact impact on inflation . It seems to be inflationary , but magnitude is uncertain . This move was something that was necessary , but needs to be implemented in the right way to ensure they get what they need , to be able to cover up for the costs . ”
TIRTHANKAR PATNAIK , INDIA STRATEGIST , MIZUHO BANK , MUMBAI
“ The 200 rupees per quintal hike for paddy is very reasonable , so not likely to rattle markets . If the number was anything beyond 200 rupees , there could have been some market implication . The hike will add about a 25 basis point number to headline inflation , which the government would be okay with . I think this hike should not have too much of a negative impact .
“ The hike in ragi crop was higher than expected . A larger hike in paddy would have moved the needle . So , this is a negative , but not an unexpected negative from a fiscal balance perspective . It is quite clear it was a question between keeping the farmer community happy in the pre-election year and also not to upset the credit rating agencies . With this hike for paddy , they have ensured the tightrope balance is fine .
“ We may see these populist measures coming from the state governments instead of federal government . I 'll not be surprised if we see similar sops from the state government simply because the current GST collection , crude at over $ 70 does not leave much room for fiscal balancing by the central government . ”
SHUBHADA RAO , CHIEF ECONOMIST , YES BANK , MUMBAI
“ The median hike from the MSPs is 25 percent compared with 3-4 percent in the last three years . The impact from these MSP hikes will be 35 basis points to headline inflation in the current fiscal year , and another 35 bps in the next . The MSP hike is broadly along expected lines , and may not accentuate concerns for the RBI on this account .
“ However , a larger concern emanates from continued elevated prices of crude oil . We maintain a risk of one more hike of 25 bps by October . We do n't see any material risk on fiscal as the impact is at a manageable level of 0.1 percent of GDP . In every preceding election year , the MSP hikes have been high , like it was 40 percent in 2009 , 27 percent in 2013 and 25 percent in 2018 . This will help in boosting farmer income and potentially offset the adverse impact of high oil prices on growth . ”
A PRASANNA , CHIEF ECONOMIST , ICICI SECURITIES PRIMARY DEALERSHIP LTD , MUMBAI
“ The newly announced minimum support prices for Kharif crops mark a steep rise in prices . We estimate that the rise in support prices of cereals and pulses in FY 2019 will be nearly 25 percent , equivalent to the cumulative increase seen over the last five years . On a CPI-weighted basis , the increase amounts to 90 basis points , and thus , we expect at least 50 bps upside risk to forward-looking inflation estimate . Should the government rely on large-scale procurement of crops to implement the prices , then the fiscal cost could be around 0.3 percent of GDP , which might be shared by the central and state governments .
“ As far as monetary policy is concerned , we expect the Monetary Policy Committee to take note of the upside risk due to direct impact of higher MSPs , fiscal cost and second-round effects . In tandem with further rise in oil prices and rupee depreciation since the June policy , this development should cement the case for another hike . We continue to expect that hike to be delivered in the October meeting . ”

The $ 30 million suit alleges that the damage , in turn , has created health risks for the population and crippled community members ' ability to observe their Indigenous traditions including fishing , hunting and gathering .
The Mattagami First Nation alleges in its statement of claim that the spills near Gogama , Ont. , damaged the local environment and surrounding waterways .
A northern Ontario Indigenous community is suing CN Rail for alleged environmental and cultural damage caused by two 2015 derailments that led to significant oil spills .
It says the two oil spills , which took place in February and March 2015 , collectively poured millions of litres of oil into the area around Gogama , which is about 200 kilometres north of Sudbury , Ont .
CN declined to comment on the filing , adding it is committed to cleaning up environmental damage caused by the derailments .
Mattagami 's allegations have not been proven in court .
The First Nation claimed the 2015 spills impacted many facets of life for community members .
“ Mattagami First Nation members have suffered stress , distress , anxiety and worry as a result of the contamination of the land , waters , plants and animals on which they rely , ” reads the First Nation 's statement of claim , which was filed in March but served to CN on Monday .
The suit alleges negligence from CN and claims the rail company breached its standard of care when conducting operations ranging from track maintenance to staff training . It also alleges CN has created a corporate culture that valued speed over safety .
The lawsuit alleges that problems began for the Mattagami First Nation late on Feb. 14 , 2015 , when 29 cars carrying crude oil derailed near Gogama .
It said the derailment took place alongside a wetlands area and a stream , resulting in the spilled oil entering the environment almost immediately . Oil eventually migrated into nearby Kazaway Lake , the statement of claim said .
The derailment also caused a fire that burned for five days , the suit contends .
Scarcely three weeks later , the suit said 39 oil-bearing cars derailed just west of Gogama on March 7 , 2015 , destroying a rail bridge in the process . Some of the cars were submerged in the Makami River , the suit said , adding the spilled oil then travelled into at least five connected waterways .
The Transportation Safety Board , which reviewed that incident , estimated the derailment dumped 2.6 million litres of oil into the local ecosystem .
There were no injuries reported , but Mattagami residents were advised to stay indoors during the cleanup due to possible smoke inhalation and told not to consume water from the community source .
The lawsuit alleges the effects of the spills continue to be felt more than two years after the derailments and are seeking compensation based on the impact the incidents had on traditional way of life .
“ The relationship Mattagami First Nation has to the land in its traditional territory is profound and interconnected with all things , ” the statement of claim reads . “ The land is the source of life , spirituality , teaching and everything in between . The importance of the land , in its unaltered form , for Mattagami First Nation can not be overstated . ”
In its review of the March derailment , released earlier this month , the Transportation Safety Board found CN bore some responsibility for the incident .
The board found the crash was caused by a broken rail that an employee failed to detect three days before the crash . The review found that a test that would have identified the problem was not conducted even though it was “ required by CN standards . ”
The board also criticized the company for not highlighting the importance of the test in its staff training and for not providing opportunities for “ practical , hands-on training . ”
As a result of its investigation into the incident , the board recommended Transport Canada consistently collect data on general rail surface conditions — and not just previously recorded defects — to better focus its track inspections and help predict future rail failures .
In response to the board review , CN said it has taken action to increase safety measures following the 2015 derailments , from improving training for all track workers to implementing stronger engineering standards for its rail repairs and inspections .
ISLAMABAD-Minister of State for Information , Broadcasting and National Heritage Marriyum Aurangzaib has felicitated all the newly-elected office-bearers of AIPS Asia and also assured her all-out support to them .

But holding of the AIPS ASIA Congress 2017 immediately after the visit of the World XI indicates and reinforces Pakistan 's image as a peaceful and sports loving country , ” she added .
Marriyum said : “ The sports journalists of any country are a special breed of journalists , who play a significant role in projecting soft image of their respective countries besides acting as their ambassadors at large . The sports writers through their writings not only spotlight the talent in different domains of sports but also help in developing close sports links with other countries ; a contribution which is highly valued and respected .
The minister said : “ Nawaz Sharif is a sports lover and love to play cricket , hockey and tennis . We strongly believe that in revival of international sports in Pakistan , all the sports journalists are soldiers of the country , who are fighting on the front for a noble cause . Sports are future of Pakistan .
“ PM Shahid Khakan Abbasi is carrying forward the vision of Nawaz Sharif . We not only enhance the budget of national sports but also allocate huge funds for participation in international sports events . If we want to defeat terrorism menace , we have to carry forward and revive traditional sports and involve our youth in healthy sports activities , ” she added .
Marriyum hoped the guests would go back to their countries with happy memories and the impression of a peaceful Pakistan would be ingrained on their minds . The congress will prove a great success as far as its objectives are concerned and a milestone in the efforts to full-fledged revival of international sports in Pakistan . ”

( Image : PA )
He said his last memory of that night was being in Haybarnes Road .
When quizzed about drugs by the coroner , he said there had been a pre-rolled cannabis cigarette in the vehicle , but denied they had been dealing in drugs or driving fast .
He said he did not remember whether Audi driver Mr Jehangir took any drugs .
What the driver behind the taxi saw
Nahome Tekle , the Yaris driver , said he had been coming from Kings Heath and had been driving at about 38mph as he approached Lee Bank Middleway and was aware of the taxi to his right which blocked his view of the Audi .
He told the inquest : “ My wife shouted my name but the taxi was blocking my view . As she shouted there was a huge collision . I never saw the Audi . ”
What the first officer on the scene said
PC Keith Evans , the first officer on the scene , also gave evidence at the inquest .
He said : “ As I approached the junction I stopped at the lights and I was aware of a loud bang . There was some smoke , steam and dust coming from the impact in the underpass .
“ I saw that there had been a serious collision and both lanes were completely blocked .
“ I was immediately aware that there were two people trapped in the taxi . I could see the legs of one person and the head and arm of another .
“ I looked for signs of life . There was a lady and I tried for a pulse but there was no reaction . ”
The officer said he saw three others on the carriageway who had suffered “ catastrophic ” injuries . ”
Frantic search for baby
The inquest heard that at one point there had been a frantic search for a baby amongst the wreckage after a baby 's bottle was found .
What happened
Police Constable Adam Green , a Forensic Collision Investigator , also gave evidence .
He told the inquest that the Audi had been trying to negotiate a shallow left hand bend when the driver lost control .
He had then tried to over correct before sliding into the opposite carriage way and into the path of the taxi .
He said at the point of impact the Audi had been travelling at 87mph and that Mohammed Fahsha was the front seat passenger , Tauqeer Hussain was Behind him , while Zakkria Khan was behind the driver , Kasir Jehangir- whose NatWest bank cards were found on the seat of the vehicle .
None of them , he said had been wearing seat belts and that the Audi had struck the central reservation twice , which could have slowed it down .
The Audi driver
During the inquest , Coroner Louise Hunt told the inquest that “ On the balance of probabilities , Kasar Jehangir was the driver of the vehicle ” .
She added : “ That 's based on the fact of his final resting position , consistent with him being in the driving seat .
“ His bank cards were found on the seat , he was insured to drive the vehicle , and Mr Khan indicated that 's where he was . ”
Drugs
Police Constable Adam Green told the inquest : “ The occupants of the Audi had all smoked cannabis at some time prior to their deaths . ”
He said the fact that driver Kasar Jehangir had smoked cannabis before the accident could have contributed to the manner of his driving .
A toxicology report was carried out on taxi driver , Imtiaz Mohammed 's body . A small amount of cocaine was in his system which the toxicologist believed was consumed within 12 hours previous to the crash .
PC Green said he was aware that Imtiaz Mohammed had previously taken a small amount of cocaine .
PC Green said that Mr Mohammed and the driver of the Toyota only had about a second to react before the collision occurred and said “ I do not believe he could have taken reasonable avoiding action . ”
Giving evidence at the hearing , Police Sergeant Alan Hands said CCTV had been used to trace the movements of the Audi , which had gone down Broad Street , and in a bid to try and identify who had been sitting where in the car .
He said bags of herbal cannabis had been found both in the Audi and outside on the road and that Mr Jehangir had been found to have £1,000 on him .
He said that there were “ reasonable ground for suspicion ” prior to the collision that offences under the Misuse of Drugs Act had been committed .
The cause of the collision
Coroner Louise Hunt who described what happened as a “ terrible tragedy ” .
She said : “ The fundamental cause of this collision was driving at excessive speed of between 94 and 100mph through a shallow left hand bend on a road with a 40mph speed limit with defective tyres and was contributed to by driving under the influence of cannabis . ”
Taxi driver
The coroner said she was concerned about taxi driver , Imtiaz Mohammed 's toxicology and would be writing to Birmingham City Council to see what monitoring could be done on taxi drivers in the future .
Tributes
Tributes were paid to all those who died including Mr Jenkins , a Bristol University graduate and nuclear scientist who now lives in Harborne , who had a passion for music and was described as a “ clinical scientist by day and a rock and roll star by night ” while his partner , Miss Davis , a deaf sign interpreter , from Kingstanding was described as a “ fun loving adventurous mom ” by her daughter .

The sister of Mr Mohammed , a father of six , said he had “ big ambitions and dreams ” and “ would always go the extra mile for passengers who loved him . ”
Mohammed Fahsha 's brother said that he was “ likeable and outgoing ” and that he excelled in cricket and football .
The family of Taqueer Hussain said : “ Tauqeer will always be remembered for his kindness loyalty and all the silly things he did as part of his personality that made us laugh . He was what a brother should be annoying but there when you needed him . He stepped up when it came to being there putting others needs before his own .
“ His memories have left us with the best part of him ; which are giving , family , & being there for one another . ”

William “ Bill ” Marshall , co-founder and chair emeritus of the Toronto International Film Festival , died on Sunday after suffering from cardiac arrest , his family confirmed in a press release . He was 77 . Marshall immigrated to Canada from Scotland in 1955 . He was “ a proud Canadian and Member of the Order of Canada , an honour he received for his many contributions to the arts , ” his family wrote . Marshall co-founded TIFF ― originally called the Festival of Festivals ― in 1976 along with Henk Van der Kolk and Dusty Cohl . In the festival 's first three years , Marshall also served as the organization 's director . “ He was a pioneer in the Canadian film industry and his vision of creating a public Festival that would bring the world to Toronto through the transformative power of cinema stands today as one of his most significant legacies , ” TIFF director and CEO Piers Handling said in a statement . “ Without his tenacity and dedication , the Toronto International Film Festival would not be among the most influential public cultural festivals today. ” Throughout his career in the Canadian film industry , Marshall produced 13 feature films , and numerous documentaries and live theater productions . His family 's statement notes that Marshall played an important role in helping establish various film organizations in Canada , including the Academy of Canadian Cinema & Television and The Toronto Film & Television Office .

ISLAMABAD , Dec 11 ( APP ) : Planning Commission Deputy Chairman Sartaj Aziz Monday said that China had become a reliable partner in Pakistan 's national development efforts as their relations had become a model of state-to-state relations .
Talking to a 60-member Chinese business delegation , Sartaj said that Pakistan was an ideal destination for Chinese investors due to the goodwill for Chinese and potential of investments in the China Pakistan Economic Corridor ( CPEC ) which had changed the economic outlook of Pakistan , and that was also being acknowledged globally .
The delegation called on him here at his office .
He said that Pakistan 's macroeconomic indicators continued to solidify grounds for a sustained upward growth trajectory because key constraints impeding the economy from achieving high growth such as power supply and security situation had improved .
The gross domestic product ( GDP ) growth increased last year to a decade high of 5.3 % , he added .
Supportive policies like historic low interest rate , high infrastructure spending and better law and order , Sartaj said , had encouraged a number of firms to pursue expansion plans .
He said that the government had announced an incentive package for exporters , which would provide an opportunity to private sectors , including foreign investors , to fully benefit from it by modernizing their business processes , investing in research and development , improving human capital , seeking international certifications , and meeting quality standards .
Sartaj Aziz said the CPEC was the most important pillar of ‘ One Belt One Road ' initiative and both the countries had agreed to build roads , railways , and oil and gas pipelines under the project .
He said nine special economic zones would be built under the CPEC , which would be open for investors across the world to come and invest in their fields of interest .
He said the Chinese technical standards were widely accepted and if those were adopted in sectors like agriculture and livestock , minerals , textile , sports and surgical goods then those could become important export items for China and rest of the world .
Sartaj Aziz said the Government of Pakistan would ensure seamless security for the Chinese friends . In that regard , a special security division had been raised and same arrangement would be made for investors as well .

ST PETERSBURG - At some point , people might have to stop being surprised at Sweden 's progress . Written off at the start of qualification , they elbowed out the Netherlands on their way to a play-off against Italy . Nobody gave them a chance in that contest but , once again , they found a way to win .
Spool forward to the finals and did anyone have them down to emerge from a group that contained Germany and Mexico ? They did , finishing on top of it . Germany had become their latest big-name scalp . Football fans would not necessarily put Switzerland alongside the Netherlands , Italy and Germany in terms of Europe 's powerhouses but Vladimir Petkovic 's team do sit sixth in the Fifa world rankings . They entered this last 16 collision as the third highest ranked nation left in the World Cup .
Sweden advanced on the back of a moment of good fortune but nobody could say they did not deserve it . Emil Forsberg , the game 's most eye-catching player , took a pass inside from the left and he dropped his shoulder to elude Granit Xhaka .
The shooting chance had opened up but Forsberg rather scraped the effort , hitting it low in the direction of the Switzerland goalkeeper Yann Sommer , who looked set to collect . Then , fate intervened . The ball squirted off Manuel Akanji and flew into the top corner .
Sweden might have added to their advantage in stoppage-time when the substitute Martin Olsson was pushed by the chasing Michael Lang as he ran clean through . Initially the referee , Damir Skomina , signalled for a penalty but it was pulled back upon VAR to a free-kick . The offence had taken place just outside the area . Lang was sent off and Ola Toivonen 's free-kick was saved by Sommer . It did not matter .
Sweden were the more proactive team and the bulk of the clearest chances were created by them . It was yet another triumph for Janne Andersson and the collective – in the truest sense – that he has put together .
Switzerland did not perform to anything like their level as they missed out on the opportunity to reach the quarter-finals for the first time since 1954 . They pushed in the final 10 minutes or so but it was too little , too late . The substitute Breel Embolo saw a header blocked on the line by Forsberg – who else ? – while Robin Olsen kept out a header from another substitute , Haris Seferovic . It was the only time he was seriously extended .
Switzerland had started with a patch-up backline , owing to the suspensions of Stephan Lichtsteiner and Fabian Schar , and a key question concerned whether their replacements , Lang and Johan Djourou , would be sufficiently solid .
Sweden wanted to find out straight away and they had a few early flickers , although one of them was sparked by a loose clearance from Sommer . The ball was returned immediately by Albin Ekdal and Marcus Berg had a sliver of space . He was quickly closed down and his shot was blocked . On the rebound , Ekdal drove high .
Moments earlier , Toivonen 's lovely flick had released Berg . The strikers have played together on various teams since the age of 14 and their understanding stood to be key . Berg was through to the right of centre ; the angle not straightforward but inviting . He sliced wastefully .
Sweden 's togetherness and consistency had driven them this far . It is not a secret as to how they will play ; the problem is how to stop them . They were by far the more threatening team in the first half and , when they went in at 0-0 , the worry for them was that they might live to regret their lack of cutting edge .
Berg forced Sommer into a diving save with a nicely executed side-on shot – the goalkeeper was at full stretch before he clawed the ball away with his fingertips – but the big chance fell to Ekdal on 40 minutes . Gustav Svensson , who came in for the suspended Sebastian Larsson , won a tackle high up the pitch and he worked the ball wide for Mikael Lustig .
The right-back , who was booked for a pull on Josip Drmic to incur a suspension , crossed deep and nobody had tracked the run of Ekdal . He was perfectly placed and he elected to measure a side-foot volley only to get it all wrong . The ball ballooned high and Ekdal sank to the ground in dismay .
Switzerland have made a habit of starting games badly at this tournament and they offered precious little as an attacking force in the first half . They lacked aggression and their attacking players could not spark . They quickened the pulse only once when Blerim Dzemaili swapped passes with Steven Zuber , getting a lovely low cut-back return , only to blast his first-time shot over the crossbar .
Forsberg is perhaps Sweden 's only star name and the wide midfielder showcased his touch and quick feet . He had several nice moments , including one shortly after half-time when he wriggled away from the referee , who had got himself into a bad position , before beating Valon Behrami and Dzemaili . The Sweden fans roared . The move ended up with Toivonen shooting wildly .
Forsberg looked the most likely player to unpick the stalemate and so it proved . Petkovic sent on Embolo and Seferovic in an attacking move but it was not Switzerland 's day . They depart with regrets . Sweden marches on .
KARACHI - Bear again rule the roost at stock market on Wednesday as the benchmark KSE-100 lost 462 points to close at 47,608.64 points .
The index witnessed another rocky session ; it opened on a bullish note carrying momentum from yesterday 's close . However , it was short lived as within half an hour of trading the index peaked at 48.6k ( up 1.1pc ) . Subsequently , bears gained control jumping at the opportunity to exit positions ahead of the prime minister 's historic appearance before JIT tomorrow ( Thursday ) . The day 's gains were erased halfway into the session and by the end of it the KSE-100 closed down 462 points wiping out yesterday 's gains as well , said analyst Adnan Sami Sheikh .
Worst index point performers were ENGRO ( slip 2.5pc ) , HUBC ( 1.8pc ) , POL ( 3pc ) , OGDC ( 1.4pc ) and LUCK ( 1.2pc ) , eroding 167 points , while HBL ( gain 1.9pc ) , DGKC ( 2.2pc ) , BAHL ( 1.3pc ) , FATIMA ( 3.3pc ) and AICL ( 2.3pc ) added 117 points to the index . Within the sectors , Fertiliser shed 82 points , E & P 's 74 points , OMC 's 67 points , Power 48 points , Cement 43 points and Engineering 28 points , while Banks added 29 points . EPCL ( rose 5pc ) continued to rally due to duty protection , while investors rushed to sell DSL ( slump 7pc ) in light of yesterday 's notice .
Analyst Arhum Ghous said positivity in the initial hours of the trading session came from the news that the government brought favourable changes in the new CGT structure for equity investors . However , oil stocks shed points as oil fell in the international commodity market . OGDC ( slip 1.38pc ) , POL ( 3.04pc ) , and PPL ( 0.30pc ) from the Oil sector closed in red . Commercial bank heavyweights including MCB ( down 1.35pc ) and UBL ( 0.06pc ) lost to the declining prices in the market . However , HBL ( gain 1.87pc ) from the aforementioned sector closed in the green zone due to attractive valuations and investor optimism . EPCL opened on its upper circuit on the back of previous day 's news regarding the antidumping duty imposed on PVC Resin imports .
Weak global crude prices , withdrawal of Shanghai Electric K-electric offer stake and concerns for likely fall in banking sector income amid falling banking spreads played a catalyst role in bearish close , observed analyst Ahsan Mehanti . Volumes fell 19 percent , while traded value shed 30 percent .
Though the election is over , more trouble is just beginning for Huma Abedin and Anthony Weiner , who are still under investigation for misuse of campaign funds in his bid for mayor , his indiscreet behavior online with an underaged girl , and her inability to keep top secret files on a government server , rather than on a server where Abedin 's husband , disgraced former congressman Anthony Weiner , participated in nude Skyping with strangers . The FBI was informed of Anthony Weiner 's behavior with a 15-year-old girl , and that seemed to push Abedin to split with Weiner , says the Inquisitr . The couple said that they had split , when Weiner went off to a rehab facility , where he was supposed to stay for three months . But after a month , sources say that the money ran out . Weiner then moved back in with his estranged wife , Abedin , and their four-year-old son . Two months ago , Abedin thought she would be back in the White House , taking on a job at the head of the Clinton administration , but instead , she is trying to stay out of the public eye , as some on Team Clinton are blaming Abedin and her sexting husband for harming the Clinton campaign .

Baku , Azerbaijan , Oct. 6
By Gulgiz Muradova – Trend :
OPEC and other oil producers are on course to agree an extension of supply cuts at upcoming meeting , with more countries being invited to join the plan against global supply glut .
OPEC and allied non-OPEC producers such as Russia agreed to limit oil supply into 2018 , but crude prices have fallen since May , partly because of higher production in several OPEC states and higher U.S. output .
Previously OPEC Sec . Gen. Barkindo called on Asia regions to join efforts to balance the market , while Russia invited Turkmenistan to join the OPEC oil output cut deal .
Gal Luft , co-director of the Washington-based Institute for the Analysis of Global Security , does not believe that OPEC will be able to lure the Asian producers .
`` Their exports are rather small and their own domestic demand considerations will dominate their decisions , `` he told Trend .
As for Turkmenistan 's joining the deal , its production is rather small , roughly 200,000 b/d so their ability to cut is limited , he said .
`` However , its a symbolic act that signals unity of cause among OPEC and non-OPEC producers , '' he said .
The OPEC-led supply cut at present covers 24 countries .
Venezuela 's oil minister previously said that an extra 10 to 12 oil-producing countries have been invited to join an OPEC-led output cut aimed at getting rid of a supply glut , Reuters said .
Eu logio del Pino said the invited countries were in South America and Africa .
Luft stressed that in its coming meeting the cartel will persist in its current policy of restrained production since the expected economic dividends have not been gained .
Saudi Arabia and non-OPEC member Russia , the world 's top two oil producers , last week agreed on the need to prolong the current deal on cuts , which expires in June , until March 2018 , pushing up prices .
With a nine-month extension now the minimum expectation for the Vienna meeting , OPEC has a lot of work to do to persuade its members and some non-OPEC producers to back the move .
In November , OPEC and non-OPEC ministers will discuss the market situation and implementation of a global deal to cut oil production .

Would you dare try the 'world 's the most dangerous ice cream ' that is so hot , you have to sign a disclaimer to eat it ?
A Glasgow cafe is dishing out scoops of the insanely spicy dessert , named Respiro Del Diavolo ( Breath of the Devil ) especially for Valentine 's Day .
But the frozen treat is so spicy that customers must be 18 years of age and sign a legal waiver before it is handed over the counter .
The disclaimer says eating the ice cream `` could be a risk of personal injury , illness & possible loss of life '' .
And staff at The Aldwych Caf even need to wear gloves when they dish out scoops .

The handmade treat comes in at a whopping 1,569,300 SHU on the Scoville scale - a measurement of the pungency of chilli peppers ,
It means the ice cream is 500 times hotter than Tabasco sauce .
The family business based on Paisley Road West , Cardonald , Glasgow , says the idea behind it comes from Italy .
Lee Bandoni , 38 , brother of Caf owner Martin , told the Daily Record : `` It started in Italy .
`` There was a place called Devil 's Bridge and with that , the Italian ice cream families used to meet up once a year and discuss how the year went for them .
`` At that point , if there were any men that showed bravery then they would eat this ice cream . So , because of the Devil 's Bridge , they called this the Breath of the Devil .

`` Every year it still happens over there and this year when Martin was away earlier in the month he brought back the idea that was passed down to him .
`` The recipe is very secret , very few of us know it and when the time is right Martin 's children will get to find out about it and they will go to Italy and learn the ins and outs of it . ''
The ice cream itself is a traditional Italian recipe from 1936 and is made from scratch every day using local ingredients and certain elements from Italy .
The brothers said they look forward to seeing what it will bring to the people across the country .
Lee added : `` This is the first one in Scotland and we know that people in Glasgow love spicy stuff .
`` We had to check with the standards agency to explain what was in it and explain that it is like a thermal nuclear explosion in your mouth .

`` That took a bit of time to get it sorted but they were happy as long as we included a disclaimer .
`` Our family in Italy see it as an honour to bring something like this here . ''
Martin Bandoni , 50 , Aldwych Caf owner , said : `` We wear gloves for protection , chilli can have different effects on the skin especially if you leave it for too long .
`` Our ice cream is just a standard price just like the rest of our ice creams . It 's £2 for a scoop in a tub and a cone is £1.90
`` There 's no premium to be paid for it , just a standard price . We would n't overcharge our customers .
`` They call the flavour a cream spice but it 's really a flavour sensation , it 's almost to trick your brain , well that 's the whole idea for it .
`` I think everyone is different when they taste it because we hear various types of suggestions . ''
Lee added : `` A lot of Italian guys go and have a romantic evening with their girlfriends or wives and they will have some this ice cream because it is a well-known fact that chilli is an aphrodisiac and it is nice with a glass of wine bubbling in your mouth .
`` So we will sell it here until just after Valentine 's Day , people should come try it . ''
( Reuters ) - Chipmaker Texas Instruments ( TXN.O ) topped Wall Street targets for first-quarter profit and gave a stronger-than-expected outlook for the second quarter , thanks to higher sales of semiconductors used in cars and industrial machinery .

TI 's shares , which have fallen 6 percent in 2018 , climbed more than 5 percent in after-hours trading on Tuesday .
The Dallas-based chipmaker , which primarily develops analogue chips used in industrial equipment , automobiles and consumer electronics , has benefited as automakers increasingly invest in self-driving technology .
The automotive industry accounted for 19 percent of TI 's revenue last year , up from 18 percent in 2016 and 15 percent in the previous year .
The company has continued to invest in its industrial and automotive chip businesses to strengthen its position , Dave Pahl , the company 's vice president and head of investor relations , said on a call with analysts .
“ This is based on our belief that industrial and automotive will be the fastest-growing semiconductor markets . They have increasing semiconductor content . These markets also provide diversity and longevity , ” Pahl said .
TI 's results come one week after semiconductor equipment maker Lam Research Corp 's ( LRCX.O ) quarterly report showed that its shipments missed Wall Street expectations for the first time since 2013 .
Lam 's results dragged other semiconductor stocks lower , and the Philadelphia SE Semiconductor Index .SOX has since fallen 8.4 percent .
The index has almost doubled in value over the past two years thanks to booming demand for chips used in automobiles , internet-connected devices and consumer gadgets .
For the second quarter , TI expects revenue of between $ 3.78 billion ( £2.7 billion ) and $ 4.10 billion , and earnings of $ 1.19 to $ 1.39 per share . The earnings forecast includes an estimated $ 10 million tax benefit .
Analysts were expecting revenue of $ 3.90 billion and earnings of $ 1.23 per share .
“ ( TI 's second-quarter outlook ) indicates that at least for them , the industry must be holding up well . We are not seeing any type of slowdown in demand for TI , ” said David Heger , an analyst at Edward Jones .
TI 's net income rose 37 percent to $ 1.37 billion or $ 1.35 per share in the three months ended March 31 . Excluding items , the company earned $ 1.21 per share , beating analysts ' average estimate by 10 cents , according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S .
First-quarter revenue rose about 11 percent to $ 3.90 billion and topped expectations of $ 3.65 billion .
Petr Mrázek is now signed with the Carolina Hurricanes . He is starting out as the backup goaltender , but he may have to be ready to carry more of the load as Cam Ward did last season , should starter Scott Darling flame out again .
In fact , Hurricanes general manager Don Waddell said that there would be a healthy competition in the starter 's crease this fall . Mrázek may wind up being the Hurricanes ' starting goaltender .
With a couple of pen strokes , Waddell got a comparable backup to what he had in Ward and saved a ton of money . Ward signed with the Chicago Blackhawks for $ 3 million while Mrázek signed a one-year deal with the ‘ Canes for $ 1.5 million .
Former # Flyers loaner goalie Petr Mrazek says he likes playing under pressure… 🤔 pic.twitter.com/chwxa04HHl — Flyers Nation ( @ PHLFlyersNation ) July 3 , 2018
Mrázek had a magical outing against the Hurricanes three years ago . Fans in Raleigh are hoping that is the Mrázek they have acquired , not the one who has struggled over the past two years to regain the former magic he had in-between the pipes . In about three months , the team and the fans will know .
Meet Petr Mrázek
Mrázek is a 26-year old Czech hockey player who was drafted by the Detroit Red Wings in the fifth round of the 2010 NHL Entry Draft . His career record is 78-64-23 , and his goals-against average ( GAA ) is 2.66 , and his save percentage ( SV % ) is .911 . He has not been considered an elite goaltender but has been serviceable and at times above average for much of his career .
It was not until the 2015-16 season that Mrázek saw a lot of action , playing in 54 games and starting 49 of them in place of starter Jimmy Howard . On Oct. 11 , 2015 , I wrote an article called “ The Magic of Mrázek ” after he shut down the Hurricanes and their best efforts in a 4-3 Red Wings victory . The score does not tell the story , but I tried to capture the magic in the article :
But , the combination of Carolina 's zeal and relentless attacking , fended off time and again by Mrázek , made this game one to remember . Unfortunately for the home crowd , the result is one that they 'd rather forget .
Mrázek was magical that night , fending off a barrage of shots by the Hurricanes . He was beginning to be the topic of speculation that he might even replace Howard as the Red Wings ' starter . But , Howard would not go quietly and eventually , the play of Mrázek began to falter , culminating in his being moved to the Philadelphia Flyers last season .
Little Mrázek Magic on Broad Street
Mrázek 's time in Philadelphia was spotty . He still had the reputation of someone who could rise to the level of being a team 's starter , but , not unlike Darling of the Hurricanes , has not been able thus far to carry that mantle . Joe Pergola wrote at Broad Street Hockey on Monday , July 2 , giving an insightful look at Mrázek 's time with the Flyers .
Pergola began with a great synopsis of the Mrázek saga : “ For the last few seasons , Mrázek has been touted as a player who had the potential to be a number one goalie in the NHL but was never able to fully beat out Jimmy Howard in Detroit . Some would say it 's because when Mrázek faced competition he would falter . Others would say he was never ready for a starting role , to begin with . More would blame the poor Detroit defense for his lapses . ”
Does that sound familiar ?
There is so much similarity to Darling—even though he has only tried to be a starter for one season—that it is uncanny . The question for the Hurricanes now is , “ Will Mrázek be able to rise above his recent past , regain the former magic that characterized his play a few years ago , and wrestle the starter 's job away from Darling ? ”
Pergola summed up Mrázek in a very accurate fashion : “ Petr Mrazek is a certainly athletic , and it can really set him apart from other goalies . However , one of the major flaws is his consistency . One night Petr can really take control of the game and stop everything thrown at him . But , the next night he could be the hockey equivalent to swiss cheese . If he is ever going to take the next step in his career , that is an area that he has to focus on . ”
Hurricanes fans do not need more swiss cheese . They have had their fill of that over the past two seasons with Eddie Lack and Darling . They need Mrázek to find the magic and deliver it consistently .
Mrázek Looks for Easy Transition to Hurricanes ' “ D ”
Also , on Monday , July 2 , Mrázek met with the Hurricanes media via telephone conference call . Since the play of the defense in from of him has at times been blamed for his poor results , I asked Mrázek what he has observed as the biggest difference defensively between the Hurricanes and the Red Wings and Flyers .
Mrázek answered ,
“ You have to know the defensemen , how they talk to you and how you have to play the puck to them and stuff like that…I 'm going to be starting the season with the team and we 're going to have the time in training camp to get used to it . The defensemen are really , really good and we all know how good and how important they are for Carolina . I think it 's going to be easy . ”
Whether or not Mrázek will have an easy time transitioning into the Hurricanes ' system remains to be seen . Also on Monday , new Hurricanes head coach Rod Brind'Amour was quoted by Chip Alexander in the Raleigh News & Observer as having said , “ Hopefully between Petr and ‘ Darls ' one of these guys will get it together and can lead us . ”
Translation for fans : We sure hope Mrázek can find the magic and lead us to the playoffs . Not that it would not be appreciated if it turns out to be Darling who has a playoff-caliber season . But , at this point all eyes are on Mrázek , looking for the magic and hoping it is there .
Roseville cop got a break
It pays to be on a police force , because as an officer of the law , you can drive drunk , not get arrested and be driving home in a police car . He didnt have to use a Breathalyzer , either . Not even a blood alcohol test .
These are the same people who are supposed to uphold the law .
It must be great to have police union attorneys , instead of having to hire your own and remember police officers protect their own too ! !
They said this was suspected drunk driving and he was charged with reckless driving ; driving the wrong way on Woodward Avenue .

Doesnt get Sterling priorities
It seems to me as a taxpayer , that your priorities are a bit skewed when it comes to spending tax dollars . You spent $ 80,000 on a sculpture of a budding plant that signifies new growth in our city , yet the majority of our roads are two treacherous to travel on should we wish to see this work of art . Another $ 339,000 is earmarked for two golden rings and plaques welcoming visitors to our Golden Mile. I dare you to travel on Hayes Road or Schoenherr Road to get there . These two main throughfares through our city are in dire need of repairs , not just patching .
There needs to be serious reconstruction of these roads before monuments and plaques and sculptures are created within our city . Drive these roads and dodge the potholes like your constituents do on a daily basis and see if you arrive at the same conclusion I did : Fix the roads first .

Got to go at MSU
After reading far too many stories about Michigan State Universitys President , athletic department , Board of Trustees , among others , over their lack of effective leadership , and oversight , during the years of Larry Nassars sexual abuse of young girls , there should be a total and complete removal of every person who had a part in allowing the abuse to continue . If I had a family member , male or female , who had been accepted , or was considering attending MSU , I would do everything in my power to convince them to choose another institute of higher learning . I wonder how much damage the lack of effective leadership is going to hurt MSUs enrollment and fundraising ? How much it will cost Michigan taxpayers to investigate , and then compensate the victims of Nassers disgusting actions ? No one who is proven to have been an enabler , or informed of Nassers assaults and did not take appropriate actions , should be allowed to resign , or quit being employed by MSU , and receive any kind of severance package . That includes former MSU President Simon , former Athletic Director Hollis , all of the current MSU Board of Trustees , football coach Mark Dantonio , basketball coach Tom Izzo , and those who conducted the sham of an MSU-paid investigation into Nassars criminal assaults .

2018-04-24 16:55 | www.trend.az | 2
China 's forex regulator said on Tuesday it widened the quotas of two outbound investment schemes in Shanghai and Shenzhen as part of the government 's efforts to liberalize financial markets , Reuters reports .
The State Administration of Foreign Exchange ( SAFE ) said it would increase the quotas of the two schemes — Qualified Domestic Limited Partner ( QDLP ) and Qualified Domestic Investment Enterprise ( QDIE ) — to $ 5 billion each .
China 's financial hubs Shanghai and Shenzhen are now conducting trials on the two schemes .
Summerville alum Briauna Jones will be traveling to PyeongChang , South Korea to take part in the Olympic Games as a member of the 2018 U.S. Olympic Women 's Bobsled Team .
Jones , who ran track and field at UNC Charlotte , has been selected as a replacement on the team . She can substitute for competing athletes during training runs , and is eligible to compete in the event of an injury or illness . If a replacement is needed , the selection committee will reevaluate the teams before making a nomination .
Jones made her first US national team in the 2016-2017 season just months after beginning the sport , and won her first World Cup medal , a gold with Elana Meyers Taylor , in St. Moritz , Switzerland last year . Jones was also named last season 's USABS Rookie of the Year .
A native of Summerville , S.C. , Jones compiled an impressive resume of awards and records in her time at Charlotte before graduating in 2014 . She holds a place on the Top-10 List for the following events : indoor 60-meter dash , indoor and outdoor long jump , indoor and outdoor triple jump , and indoor and outdoor high jump . She was also a multiple-time conference medalist in each of those events , but perhaps her greatest achievement came in 2012 when she helped the program 's 4x100 meter relay team earn a trip to the National Championships .
Most recently , Jones served as a volunteer coach with the Charlotte track & field program under Director of Track & Field and Cross Country Bob Olesen .

NEW YORK - After a rough month of July , in which he hit just .222 , Andrew Benintendi 's stock as a candidate for American League Rookie of the Year started to drop .
But a weekend trip to New York has brought him right back into contention .
Benintendi went 5-for-13 with three home runs and RBIs in the series against the Yankees and slapping a game-winning RBI single in the 10th inning in Sunday night 's 3-2 win over the Yankees .
Staying true to form , Benintendi downplayed his big weekend at the plate that contributed to winning two of three games in the series .
`` I 'm glad I could help the team win , '' he said . `` I was struggling the last few months , weeks , and to help the team win , it feels pretty good . ''
While Yankees rookie Aaron Judge has stolen Rookie of the Year headlines and still appears the frontrunner for the award despite a second-half slump , Benintendi is not too far out of contention .
In 108 games , Benintendi is hitting .279 with a .806 OPS , 17 doubles , one triple and 16 homers .
In 112 games , Judge is hitting .289 with a 1.022 OPS , 14 doubles , three triples and 35 homers .
Regardless , Benintendi is producing at the plate when needed most .
On Sunday night with the game tied 2-2 , the left fielder stepped in against Yankees reliever Tommy Kahnle with the bases loaded and one out .
`` He 's been right man , right spot , bases loaded , what was beautiful was he lays off a couple of really tough hard sliders from Kahnle and gets a fastball for a line drive basehit , '' Red Sox manager John Farrell said .
On Saturday , Benintendi hit two , three-run homers to power Boston 's win .
Riding a seven-game hitting streak , Benintendi 's mid-season slump seems long gone and he 's heating up at just the right time for the Red Sox .

Justin Turner smacks a three-run homer in the first inning and records RBI singles in the fourth and eighth innings as Los Angeles takes Game 1 against Arizona . ( 0:53 )
LOS ANGELES -- Baseball 's postseason is a time of resetting in that everyone begins at 0-0 . Still , each team brings with it the baggage of the regular season , the sixth-month slog during which narratives are constructed .
The Los Angeles Dodgers got a good start on a fresh fall tale Friday , riding a Justin Turner-led four-run first to back Clayton Kershaw in his mixed bag of an outing . The Dodgers beat Arizona 9-5 to grab a 1-0 lead in their National League Division Series matchup and snap a six-game losing streak to the Diamondbacks .
For three mysterious weeks this season , everyone in the baseball universe puzzled over the struggles of the seemingly invincible Dodgers . You remember them : The team that raced to a 91-36 record , stepping on everyone 's throat on a nightly basis and not letting up .
The team of historic dominance that then went missing during a skid of 16 losses in 17 games .
Justin Turner tied a Dodgers postseason record with his five RBIs in Game 1 . Maxx Wolfson/Getty Images
In search of their first title since 1988 , the Dodgers entered the postseason as rickety as a 104-win team could possibly be . Down what path would their October narrative lead : That of the dominant Dodgers , or that of doubtable Dodgers ?
Score one for a little of both .
The Dodgers put the first five batters on base against a Diamondbacks starter , Taijuan Walker , making his first postseason appearance . That rally included a three-run jolt to left from Turner , sending jam-packed Dodger Stadium into a frenzy . It also included an RBI double by emotional powder keg Yasiel Puig .
Walker escaped further damage but finished the first frame with 48 pitches and was replaced by Zack Godley before the start of the second inning . Add another name to baseball 's growing list of successful regular-season starters who have been knocked out early during the first week of the 2017 postseason -- eight of 16 so far have n't made it to the fifth inning .
The quick lead and solid run prevention to protect it was reminiscent of the Dodgers team that went 56-11 over one stretch of the season . At times the team did look dominant , mostly because Kershaw looked a bit more like his All-Star self than the version that returned from the disabled list late in the season .
Kershaw entered the game with his 4.55 career playoff ERA hanging over his head , and for a brief moment , that history stirred when he walked David Peralta to start the game . But he escaped the inning by striking out Diamondbacks sluggers Paul Goldschmidt and J.D . Martinez .
Kershaw mostly cruised through six innings , giving up solo homers to A.J . Pollock in the third and Martinez in the sixth . He came out for the seventh despite holding a career 23.82 postseason ERA in that frame . Sure enough , he gave up back-to-back rockets into the left-field seats to Ketel Marte and Jeff Mathis .
That was it for Kershaw -- 6 1/3 innings , 7 strikeouts , 5 hits allowed ( but 4 of them long balls ) and 3 walks . Let 's face it , it was n't bad , especially given the sudden plague that has struck top-flight starters in recent days , but it was n't elite-level Kershaw either .
There were good portents for the Dodgers elsewhere . Some of those appeared in the fourth , when Corey Seager 's RBI single and another RBI from Turner keyed a three-run rally against Godley that broke open the game . That 's two more Dodger stars who faded a bit late but look poised for an October push .
Turner 's five RBIs on the night tied the Dodgers ' postseason record set by Davey Lopes in 1978 and Pedro Guerrero in 1981 .
For the Dodgers , it was just the first step , but given Arizona 's regular-season record against them ( 11-8 ) and the late-season surge of the Diamondbacks ' starting rotation , the Snakes entered the series as a trendy upset pick . A Game 1 loss surely would have spurred the Cassandras of the L.A. baseball world to scream in unison .
Those doomsdayers will have to wait another day . But the Diamondbacks remain capable of striking back , and in Saturday 's Game 2 , they 'll send Dodgers killer Robbie Ray to the mound .
In October , dominance only lasts as long as your last game .
Authorities have arrested a man who they say was the driver of a truck that hit and seriously injured a woman Sept. 22 in the 100 block of Encinitas Boulevard and fled .
The San Diego County Sheriff 's Department 's North Coastal Station , with the help of the public , identified 38-year-old Justin Parker of Encinitas as the driver .
A search warrant was served to Parker 's home , and `` numerous items of evidence '' were recovered , according to a news release from the Sheriff 's Department . Deputies also found two large-capacity rifle magazines in his house .
Another search warrant was served at a custom automotive shop in Riverside , where Parker 's truck , a white Ford F-150 pickup , was located , authorities said . The vehicle had already been repaired but additional evidence was located .
Parker walked into the North Coastal Sheriff 's station Oct. 5 at about 6:30 p.m. to turn himself in , according to the Sheriff 's Department . He was arrested and booked at the Vista Detention Facility for hit-and-run with serious bodily injury and possession of a large-capacity magazine .
A bail enhancement was requested for Parker . His bail was set at $ 250,000 , and he was ultimately bailed out at 1 a.m. Oct. 6 , according to the news release .
Authorities said Parker ran down Ashley Mullins Lane , 33 , of Oceanside , while she was walking across Encinitas Boulevard toward a train station .
Lane was crossing mid-block near South Coast Highway 101 about 7:30 p.m. when she was struck by the westbound pickup . Witnesses told authorities the driver stopped , got out of his truck to look , and told those nearby that the woman appeared to be OK. Then he drove off .
Lane has remained at Scripps Memorial Hospital La Jolla , where she was put in a medically-induced coma with critical spine , head , pelvic and other injuries . Her father , Roger Mullins of Encinitas , said in an interview that his daughter also suffered a ruptured spleen , a stroke , and is paralyzed on her left side .
He said she was leaving work , at Lazy Acres market , and heading home when she was hit by the truck . She has two daughters , ages 12 and 13 .
Family members have set up a GoFundMe account to raise money for Lane 's medical bills . Her father said she had just lost her Medi-Cal insurance and had not yet submitted papers to join her employer 's health plan .

Going home for the holidays is always a welcome escape from school and the everyday hustle and bustle of life . However , ‘ back home ' for me is the boonies , the sticks , the country . While the slower pace is nice , I always get a little more slow than I bargain for . Slow Internet , that is .
Sometimes , it 's slow enough to be deemed unusable . The idea of Internet in the bush is more of a symbol or an idea , a technological feat to strive for , than an actual service . With the United Nations declaring the Internet a basic human right in today 's technology-minded world , it 's astonishing that some rural areas still do n't even have basic access .
I 'm not just a millennial with a socially acceptable addiction to being connected : the Internet is essential and crucial to functioning in our current society . So , it 's about time the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission 's ( CRTC ) decided to treat broadband Internet access as a “ basic telecommunications service , ” which means it 's finally time for them to give us in the countryside all the Internet .
They report that they hope to reduce the 18 % of Canadian homes without adequate Internet to 10 % in the next five years , and eradicate it entirely within the next 10 or 15 . They 're also requiring service providers to put money into a fund — projected to grow to about $ 750 million worth — to facilitate these changes .
This may translate to increased prices on services to compensate . With no regulation on rates accompanying the new mandate , consumers are in a tight spot : if the CRTC makes service providers pay more money , those providers will take it straight from our pockets , and without proper policies in place , there 's no telling whether or not we 're going to be charged fairly .
The overall goal is to be able to offer high-speed Internet services to rural areas , with only the hope that they will be affordable . This is n't good enough . This does n't equate to providing adequate Internet to all citizens , not when that access might itself be unfairly inaccessible for financial reasons . This lack of foresight demonstrates a real failure to provide the fundamental human right . What , exactly , is the CRTC doing ?
The CRTC has come under fire for being stuck in the past and an obsolete regulator , but in spite of those flaws , it 's still the only credible Canadian regulator which is separate from government . While policing the Internet has always been frowned upon , financial regulation done in the interest of providing it for everyone at an affordable price would be in the best interests of Canadians .
The Internet has become key to meeting our most basic human needs . Newspaper classifieds have gone the way of the dodo . Finding a job , finding a place to live , and , not to mention , socializing is all done via a broadband connection . Even inmates have the right to access the web . Providing Internet service to all at a respectable speed is imperative , but not the final goal — it needs to be at a reasonable price , and we need to do more to ensure that .
Canada is ranked only 33rd in the world for Internet speed . If the CRTC is going to be relevant in our expanding technological society , it needs to work harder to protect the ‘ public interest , ' even if the regulations and policies necessary to truly accomplish that are at the expense of the companies which provide Internet services .
Bank of Korea ( Yonhap )
Loans extended by savings banks , insurers and other nonbanking institutions hit a record high in the first six months of the year , South Korea 's central bank said Monday.The data compiled by the Bank of Korea showed that outstanding loans extended by nonbanking financial companies reached 763.6 trillion won ( $ 671 billion ) as of end-June , the highest since 1993 when the central bank began to compile related data . It marks a 5.4 percent , or 39.1 trillion won , rise from the end of last year.It is widely believed that a growing number of people turned to nonbank lenders for mortgage and other loans as local banks tightened lending regulations.The hike caused concerns , as nonbanking financial institutions charge higher interest rates than banks , and lower-income people and self-employed individuals rely more on nonbanking financial institutions.Those who take loans from nonbanking financial institutions could also face an increased debt burden if the central bank raises key interest rates.In July , the BOK kept its policy rate at an all-time low of 1.25 percent , but it said that it may take a monetary tightening approach if the economy shows signs of a robust recovery , a comment widely seen as signaling a rate hike by the central bank over the long haul.As of end-March , South Korea 's overall household debt came to a record high of 1,360 trillion won , up 11.1 percent from 1,224 trillion won a year earlier .

U.S. stocks rose on Wednesday , with a surge in energy stocks helping Wall Street recover from a steep selloff in the previous session that was driven by political turmoil in Italy .
Hopes that Italy might avoid a potentially damaging general election set the markets off to a strong start on Wednesday .
At the session 's peak , the S & P 500 erased all its losses from Tuesday on news that Italy 's 5-Star Movement party called for Eurosceptic economist Paola Savona to withdraw his candidacy as economy minister to the possible formation of a government .
“ The extent that it sold off was probably a little too much . So a little bit of a bounce back is not that big a surprise , ” said Randy Frederick , vice president of trading and derivatives for Charles Schwab in Austin , Texas .
Fears about the political instability had sent investors scurrying to safety assets on Tuesday , with the U.S. Treasury market enjoying its best day in at least about seven years . However , stocks took a beating , with the S & P 500 posting its first 1 percent drop in May .
At 1:13 p.m . ET , the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 286.48 points , or 1.18 percent , at 24,647.93 , the S & P 500 was up 32.91 points , or 1.22 percent , at 2,722.77 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 61.05 points , or 0.83 percent , at 7,457.65 .
Traders also said the political uncertainty in Italy also led to a drop in the expectations for U.S. interest rate hikes for the year , helping the stock markets gain momentum .
“ In essence , investors perceived the mounting risks in Europe to warrant almost one less rate hike this year than just one week ago , a meaningful shift in investor sentiment , ” John Lynch , chief equity strategist at LPL Financial in Charlotte , North Carolina , wrote in a note .
The S & P energy index jumped 3.13 percent and was on track for its biggest one-day gain in nearly three weeks .
Energy shares , which provided the biggest boost to the S & P 500 , benefited from a more than 2.4 percent surge in crude oil prices .
Bank stocks , which were the worst hit on Tuesday , recovered with the S & P financial index rising 1.86 percent .
Cloud-based business software maker Salesforce.com rose 1.7 percent , while computer and printer maker HP Inc jumped 3.4 percent after raising full-year profit forecasts .
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 4.28-to-1 ratio on the NYSE . Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 2.77-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq .
The S & P index recorded 24 new 52-week highs and two new lows , while the Nasdaq recorded 171 new highs and 21 new lows .

Investigators are trying to determine whether anyone else was in the Las Vegas gunman 's hotel room during the time he was registered there , multiple senior law enforcement officials briefed on the investigation told NBC News .
The investigators are puzzled by two discoveries : First , a charger was found that does not match any of the cellphones that belonged to the gunman , Stephen Paddock .
And second : Garage records show that during a period when Paddock 's car left the hotel garage , one of his key cards was used to get into his room .
JOHANNESBURG , Feb 2 ( Reuters ) - South Africa 's central bank has fined China Construction Bank ( CCB ) 75 million rand ( $ 6 million ) for non-compliance with the country 's financial intelligence act , it said on Friday .
“ It should be noted that the administrative sanctions were not imposed because CCB was found to have facilitated transactions involving money laundering or the financing of terrorism but because of weaknesses in the bank 's control measures , ” the central bank said in a statement .
The regulator said 20 million rand of the fine would be suspended pending the Chinese Construction Bank 's compliance with conditions imposed . ( $ 1 = 12.0685 rand ) ( Reporting by Joe Brock ; Editing by James Macharia )
Lebanon 's Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah speaks via a screen during a rally marking the 11th anniversary of the end of Hezbollah 's 2006 war with Israel , in the southern village of Khiam , Lebanon August 13 , 2017 .
BEIRUT ( Reuters ) - The leader of Lebanon 's Hezbollah on Sunday dismissed the prospect of tougher U.S. sanctions against his group , which is backed by Iran , and said the U.S. administration had no way to harm it .
`` The American administration , with all available and possible means , will not be able to damage the strength of the resistance , '' Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah said in a televised address to mark the anniversary of the end of Hezbollah 's 2006 war with Israel .
Nasrallah said Lebanon was being subjected to intimidation and threats over Hezbollah - which is part of the Beirut government but classified as a terrorist group by Washington - and alleged that Lebanese officials had been told that Israel could launch a war .
European and American officials had warned them `` during diplomatic meetings and international visits ... if you do n't do this , Israel will launch a war on Lebanon , and if Hezbollah does n't do this , Israel will launch a war on Lebanon '' , Nasrallah said . He did not spell out what had been asked of Lebanon or Hezbollah .
Tensions between Israel and Hezbollah , a well armed Shi'ite movement , have risen this year . Nasrallah has played down the prospect of a war while simultaneously warning Israel against a conflict .
Trump last month called Hezbollah a `` menace '' to the Lebanese people and to the entire region during a news conference with Lebanese Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri .
U.S. lawmakers last month introduced legislation seeking to increase sanctions on Hezbollah by further restricting its ability to raise money and recruit and by increasing pressure on banks that do business with it , though it was not clear when or if it would come to a vote .
Officials in Lebanon have raised concerns that any widening of the U.S. sanctions could damage their banking industry .

It is always great to have a new film to binge watch , but “ Sandy Wexler ” is not one . Adam Sandler 's new film is by far the worst movie of 2017 . The star-studded cast , which consists of Jennifer Hudson ( “ Sing ” ) as Courtney Clarke , Kevin James ( “ Paul Blart : Mall Cop ” ) as Ted Rafferty and Terry Crews ( “ Brooklyn Nine Nine ” ) as “ Bedtime ” Bobby Barnes , can not save this failure of a film .
“ Sandy Wexler 's ” plot as a whole is n't that heavy or interesting . It revolves around Sandy Wexler who lives in L.A. and his failure as a talent manager . As Sandy Wexler finds interest in a performer at a theme park , by the name of Courtney Clarke he successfully becomes her talent manager . Soon after , he starts to assist Courtney in making herself a recognized name in the music industry . Courtney 's popularity increases and so does Sandy Wexler 's love for Courtney . Sandy 's problem is that he worries about others rather than himself , as he finds who he truly is , and hopefully wins back the heart of Courtney .
The acting in the film is just bad . Adam Sandler uses an accent that sounds like an overdone account of his character in Happy Gilmore . Adam Sandler acts like every other film he is in , like a bit of a low life and someone in a mid-life crisis , which is shameful . Jennifer Hudson does a decent job as Courtney , a rising singer who goes from shame to fame . She is sometimes quirky , but some of her actions do n't make sense .
Besides that , the jokes in this film are so unenjoyable that it is hard not to get turned off . Things from a puppeteer hanging himself , to an absurd amount of slapstick humor make the film look like it 's trying too hard to win you over . Though at times jokes from cameos such as Jimmy Kimmel and Jay Leno can crack up some laughs , overall , the jokes make for a failed and lackluster film .
The one thing that the Sandy Wexler does an okay job is in its characters , as each character has a bit of a story . We see Kevin James 's character as a puppeteer and Terry Crews as a wrestler with a weird baby alter ego who is named “ Bedtime ” Bobby Barnes .
At the end of the day , it 's just another Adam Sandler Netflix film , which takes on a failing talent manager and the rough bumps along the way.It 's Adam Sandler 's way of showing what a mid life crisis does to a talented actor and as a result gave the community this film . Honestly , the biggest problem this film has is its sense of humor , which is like a long day of school : tiring and unenjoyable .
The star-studded cast can not help this film ; its running time of two hours and 11 minutes makes it a chore to watch this film . Everything from the acting is terrible , and the plot is not even interesting with terrible jokes . The only thing here is an interesting group of characters . It would be really interesting to see a film about Terry Crews 's character as the “ Bedtime ” Bobby Barnes . Though besides that this movie is nothing more than another failure by the aging Adam Sandler .
The big takeaway from this film is , do not watch “ Sandy Wexler. ” If you thought being a talent manager would be a cool job , think again because honestly nothing about it is fun , especially in Netflix 's flunk of a film , streaming now .
( Corrects amount of fines to C $ 1.1 million not C $ 1.1 billion )
TORONTO , Feb 2 ( Reuters ) - Ontario 's financial regulator said on Friday it has revoked the license of mortgage brokerage Building Development and Mortgages Canada Inc ( BDMC ) and Vince Petrozza , a co-founder of a related firm , Fortress Real Developments , following an investigation into risky syndicated mortgage investments .
FSCO said BDMC , the lead broker for Fortress projects , and three mortgage brokers - FDS Broker Services Inc , FFM Capital Inc and FMP Mortgage Investments Inc - which marketed Fortress products as their primary or sole line of business - were fined a total of C $ 1.1 million .
In a special report published in November , Reuters revealed the Financial Services Commission of Ontario ( FSCO ) had been investigating brokers raising funds for projects associated with Fortress since 2011 but had failed to take action despite repeated warnings of the risky investments that broke provincial laws .
The regulator revoked the broker licenses of Petrozza and three other individuals , requiring them to stop all mortgage brokering businesses immediately .
Ildina Galati-Ferranti , principle broker of BDMC , surrendered her broker license and was required to cease all mortgage brokering activities . ( Reporting by Matt Scuffham ; Editing by Jeffrey Benkoe )

A national campaign to help raise awareness on the health benefits of eggs , has been launched in Accra .
The overall purpose of the campaign is to help educate consumers and the public with messages that will break the myth surrounding cholesterol associated with eggs and boost Ghana 's poultry sector .
The National Association of Poultry Farmers , Ghana Health Service , Ministry of Food and Agriculture ( MOFA ) and other stakeholders , implementing the national egg campaign as part of the food for progress initiative , that is carried out by the Ghana Poultry Project ( GPP ) .
Speaking at the launch in Accra , the Director Animal Production of MOFA , Kwamina Arkorful , said Ghana suffered protein deficiency and malnutrition among children and childbearing women .
He revealed that per an FAO report , nearly a quarter of pre-school children are stunted and affected by chronic malnutrition according to FAO Country Profile report 2012 .
“ It is estimated that per capita consumption hovers around 18-24 eggs of about 26 million population , compared to Mexico ( 321Eggs ) , USA ( 255 Eggs ) , France ( 248 Eggs ) , Portugal ( 186 Eggs ) , India ( 40 Eggs ) , ” he said .
He said the underlying causes of Ghanaians ' aversion to egg consumption could be traced to age-old beliefs and misconceptions that have been handed down from generation to generation , but have no factual status .
Mr. Arkorful therefore , urged Ghanaians to eat eggs on daily basis for healthy living .
Also , the Vice Chairman of the Ghana National Association of Poultry Farmers ( GNAPF ) , Napoleon Oduro Adjei urged government to take urgent steps to revamp and give a new lease of life to the nation 's collapsing poultry industry .
He said the poultry sector must be supported to operate more efficiently ; the industry was one area that could create jobs and wealth for the people .
Oduro Adjei also called for the formulation of a policy to as a matter of urgency , to salvage the ailing sector .
On his part , President of the Ghana Journalists Association ( GJA ) , Affil Monney , thanked the organizers for the timely information .
He said the low consumption of eggs in Ghana is due to the misconceptions being propagated by supposed experts in the media so such training will enable journalists put out the right information .
Affil Monney pledged their support to ensure the national egg campaign is successful .

The Mayan civilization was much bigger than anyone realized — on a par with ancient Greece or China , according to a major archaeological breakthrough .
Researchers have digitally unearthed more than 60,000 man-made ruins — including palaces , cities and elevated highways — that have been hidden for centuries in the jungles of northern Guatemala , National Geographic reports .
The Mayan civilization was previously believed to be populated by 5 million people , but the breakthrough shows it may have been up to three times bigger , according to the archaeologists behind the report .

Mercedes-Benz revealed the new A-Class Tuesday ahead of a debut on Wednesday at the 2018 Beijing auto show . The version shown , known as the A-Class L , has been developed specifically for the Chinese market .
An A-Class sedan for the rest of the world will be revealed shortly . It 's expected to reach showrooms in the United States this fall as a 2019 model , and when it arrives it should become the Three-Pointed Star 's new entry-level option due to an expected starting price of about $ 30k .
2019 Mercedes-Benz A-Class L Enlarge Photo
The A-Class sedan is the second of eight body styles planned for Mercedes ' new generation of compacts , the first being the A-Class hatchback revealed in February . And despite the addition of the A-Class sedan , Mercedes is planning a repeat of its coupe-like CLA . This model should bow sometime next year .
Underpinning Mercedes ' new compacts is an updated version of the MFA ( Modular Front-drive Architecture ) platform used for the outgoing generation . Referred to as MFA2 , the updated platform brings weight savings plus the capacity for alternative drivetrains .
Compared to the A-Class hatch , the A-Class L sedan has a slightly longer wheelbase : 109.8 inches instead of 107.44 . It also sports a Chinese market-specific turbocharged inline-4 engine displacing just 1.33 liters and offering up to 163 horsepower . A turbocharged 2.0-liter mill with 190 hp will be offered later . A 7-speed dual-clutch transmission is standard across the range . The trunk space meanwhile is about 14.8 cubic feet .
2019 Mercedes-Benz A-Class L Enlarge Photo
The standard powertrain in the U.S. should be a 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-4 delivering about 224 horsepower to the front wheels via a 7-speed dual-clutch transmission . All-wheel drive will be available and standard on high-performance models from AMG . This time there is expected to be both 35 and 45 series from AMG , with the latter likely to deliver more than 400 hp .
The MFA2-based cars also benefit from a much more advanced interface . Dubbed MBUX , short for Mercedes-Benz User Experience , the new interface features digital screens for the instrument cluster and infotainment system , much like on the pricier E-Class and S-Class models . However , there 's also touch capability for the infotainment screen and you 'll also be able to use natural speech to control many vehicle functions .
Mercedes is also using the Beijing auto show for the debut of its Vision Mercedes-Maybach Ultimate Luxury concept , which is thought to preview the next-generation GLS . For more from the show , head to our dedicated hub .

Member of the cast James Witt performs as Boris Johnson in 'Brexit-The Musical ' at the Edinburgh Fringe , in Edinburgh , Scotland , Britain August 11 , 2017 . Picture taken August 11 , 2017 .
EDINBURGH ( Reuters ) - A retelling of Britain 's vote to leave the European Union and its dramatic political consequences might perhaps be framed as high drama or extreme farce .
But audiences at the Edinburgh Festival are lapping up a light-hearted sung comedy version , `` Brexit The Musical '' , a sellout featuring a cavorting Boris Johnson , the most prominent Brexit campaigner , in matching Union Jack underpants and socks , looking for a lost plan .
On hearing the news that `` Leave '' has won , Johnson , who in reality surprised many with his decision to campaign to leave the EU and is now Britain 's foreign secretary , sings in horror : `` Leaving Europe will be a catastrophe/ Overnight we 'll bugger the economy . ''
Britons voted to leave the EU in June 2016 , but since then a host of unforeseen political consequences , including a snap election in which the Conservative government lost its majority , have mired the country in uncertainty . There is still no clarity about what Brexit will mean in practical terms .
In the comedy version , David Cameron is relieved , once he has resigned as prime minister after the vote , that he no longer has to pretend to be an ordinary man of the people . Michael Gove , Boris 's pro-Leave sidekick and in reality now agriculture secretary , sports a tartan dressing gown and fluffy slippers and just wants to be liked .

And for the leader of the main opposition Labour Party , Jeremy Corbyn , the Brexit vote means above all that he has to miss the Glastonbury music festival .
Slideshow ( 2 Images )
With the political outlook still confused a year after the Brexit vote took place , the show 's writer , 39-year-old EU trade lawyer Chris Bryant , told Reuters the show was meant as `` an escape from the dreary reality of where we are '' .
An almost-happy ending , which can not be revealed in print , is the stuff of fiction , he said . Bryant thinks it more likely that Britain will end up cutting all formal ties with the EU .
`` I think we are heading towards a colossal mess , and I 'm of the view that we will end up with a 'hard Brexit ' almost by accident , rather than by design . ''
The show will run for the whole month of the Festival , and Bryant hopes to take it to London .

I do n't care whether the evil maniac who slaughtered at least 59 people in Las Vegas was a Muslim or a Christian , a Democrat or a Republican , a bigot or a terrorist .
I do n't care whether you call what he did — the worst mass shooting in American history — a terror attack or an act of radical Islamic terrorism or a massacre or a hate crime .
What I care about is this : Without legally purchased military-style rifles , he would 've just been a guy sitting in a hotel room .
Those first three paragraphs are almost exactly what I wrote on June 16 , 2016 , after 49 people were gunned down in an Orlando gay bar . Only a few things changed : the number killed , which has gone up ; the location of the shooting ; “ rifle ” to “ rifles ” because this shooter had several ; and where the shooter was located — a hotel room instead of a bar .
I 'm sure at some point , in a month or a year or two years , I 'll be able to write those same three paragraphs again , with minor changes to update the details of the new worst mass shooting in American history . And that 's because the only thing more consistent than mass shootings is our unwillingness to learn anything from such tragedies .
Already we 've been told the attack in Las Vegas , which also left more than 500 people at an outdoor concert injured , was an act of pure evil , and that evil ca n't be legislated . Already we 've been told it 's too soon to talk about gun control . Already we 've been instructed that the only appropriate response , now and forever , is to send thoughts and prayers .
I have to imagine that God , at this point in America 's violent history , has heard enough prayers and is waiting for some to realize that humans were given brains and common sense with the expectation that those things would come in handy . Maybe God is wondering why we keep praying and do n't start using our heads .
We 'll learn more in the days to come about Stephen Craig Paddock , the 64-year-old Nevadan who , from the 32nd-floor of the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino , opened fire on a crowd at an outdoor country music concert . We 'll learn where and how he got the guns — as many as 10 , according to authorities — and whether he modified any of them from semi-automatic to fully automatic , increasing the speed with which he could murder innocents .
We 'll learn what drove him , though as Las Vegas Sheriff Joseph Lombardo said Monday : “ I ca n't get inside the mind of a psychopath . ”
We 'll hear devastating stories of the victims and their families and uplifting stories of the bravery and compassion of first responders .
And , if form holds , time will pass and the Las Vegas shooting — the now-worst mass shooting in American history — will become an entry on Wikipedia and an event we remember when its anniversary comes around , at least until something worse takes its place .

President Donald Trump said : “ We pray for the entire nation to find unity and peace , and we pray for the day when evil is banished and the innocent are safe from hatred and from fear . ”
Republican House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy released a statement saying : “ These are times when we turn to God trying to understand how such inhuman acts can happen . ”
The world has never found a way to banish evil , and I think we have some clues as to how such inhuman acts can happen .
According to data collected by the nonprofit Gun Violence Archive , in the first nine months of this year , there have been 271 mass shootings , meaning four or more people shot in a single event , not including the shooter ; 11,572 gun deaths ; and 2,971 children or teenagers shot .
Tighter gun control , on its own , is not the answer . Anyone who carries a bag of guns into a casino hotel room and opens fire on a crowd of concertgoers clearly has a mental health issue that has gone untreated .
We 're never going to find a magnet big enough to pull all the guns in the country up , and we 'll never be able to make it impossible for a lunatic to get hold of guns and take innocent lives .
But that 's no reason to fall back on prayers and simply hope for an explanation from God . There are steps we can take , on guns and on mental health , and we talk and we talk and we scream and we scream and nothing ever gets done .
In the column following the Orlando massacre , I wrote : “ Every time there 's a mass shooting in this country — and it 's getting to be a bit too frequent , would n't you say ? — one group of Americans points out that the common denominator in these tragedies is the device that sends the bullets into people 's bodies and another group clutches their pocket Constitutions to their chests and cries , ‘ Tyranny ! ' “
I 'll be able to repeat that one again as well .
America is unique in its gun violence problem . And surely Americans have the brains and common sense to sensibly address that problem .
Why we ca n't — or wo n't — is something I imagine even God does n't quite understand .

macOS Classic — Extensions
Back in ye olden times—back before Mac OS X was a thing—the classic Macintosh operating system had a cool little feature called Extensions . These were , essentially , little TSRs—programs that ran and stayed running in the background . The obvious usage for these were things such as device drivers and custom theme systems , all of which can be accomplished on Linux just fine . So , why are Extensions so cool ? It was all about how easy they were to manage .
An Extension is a single file that you simply drag into your Extensions folder , and the next time you reboot , the extension is loaded . ( Those icons along the bottom of the macOS boot screen ? Those are Extensions . ) Do n't want to use an Extension anymore ? Simply drag it out of that Extensions folder . Is one extension causing problems ? Reboot holding down the Shift key , and all Extensions are disabled . Handy . Easy .
For Nick Viall , it looks like the fourth time really was the charm . You do n't need The Bachelor spoilers to tell you that either : He 's saying it !
The Bachelor star says he did indeed find love on the show this season , which premieres tonight after a Prelude-to-Nick special Sunday .
Nick , of course , has endured rejection on The Bachelorette twice ( Andi Dorfman and Kaitlyn Bristowe ) and Bachelor in Paradise ( Amanda Stanton ) .
On the flip side , he 's gotten laid a lot … but that 's a subject for another time . And the slideshow appearing at the bottom of this article .
Anyway , this time it worked out .
“ I definitely found love , ” the star of The Bachelor tells Us , though “ I do n't think there was an easy decision I made throughout the entire process . ”
The native Waukesha , Wisconsin ( now based in Los Angeles , via Chicago ) , admits there were “ certainly some nerves and fears ” involved . ”
“ But I 'm not someone who tends to look back . And I 've always been one to put myself out there and be vulnerable , ” he says .
Was he confident that he 'd find love this year ?
“ I think a lot of people go into The Bachelor assuming it 's going to work out , but I went in knowing there are …read more

WINONA , Minn. ( KTTC ) - The Winona boys hockey team played Mankato West on Saturday at a brand new outdoor rink built on the site of the Bud King Ice Arena .
Mankato West jumped out to a 1-0 lead , bit Winhawks forward Zeb Trombetta tied the game in the second period . The Scarlets won the contest , 6-2 .
DONGYING , China ( Reuters ) - ExxonMobil Corp 's global oil marketing team stormed into China this week hoping to elbow aside rivals and gain access to the nation 's “ teapot ” refining market , executives told Reuters .

The push by Exxon , the world 's biggest oil and gas company by market value , to court the independent refiners , known as teapots , illustrates the clout they are exerting on the global oil market since winning crude import licenses from the government in 2015 . The refiners are big foreign crude buyers in a country that is now the world 's largest oil importer .
To make up for a late arrival , Exxon this week sent a dozen traders and marketers , including global crude marketing manager Thomas Martenak , to an oil trade show in Dongying , a hub for the independent refiners in the eastern province of Shandong .
The team included crude oil traders , products marketers and finance staff from Houston , Singapore , Thailand and Shanghai .
At a booth at the centre of Dongying 's downtown exhibit hall , staff handed out gift bags containing backpacks emblazoned with the ExxonMobil logo , flanked by stands from Malaysia 's Petroliam Nasional and France 's Total and about 20 local refiners .
On Monday evening , Exxon 's team wined and dined prospective customers and traders at a dinner attended by around 200 guests , according to multiple people who attended . Goodie bags at the party contained flasks for travel use , they said .
The marketing blitz is a departure from Exxon 's traditional methods of peddling their crude such as one-on-one meetings .
“ I have never seen ExxonMobil ever do this kind of thing in my whole career , ” said Lau Kay Hoe , a delegate who retired recently after more than three decades working in shipping and trading at the company .
Exxon produces 2.5 million barrels per day ( bpd ) of crude from Europe , Africa , the Middle East and the Americas that mainly supplies its own refining system .
The company push occurs amid a looming trade war between the United States and China , the world 's two biggest economies . The two sides agreed in talks earlier this month that U.S. energy sales were crucial to offsetting the $ 335 billion trade deficit the U.S. has with China , its top trading partner .
Martenak , who flew in from Houston for the event , said the firm was drawn by the growing importance of China 's independent refiners in the regional market , rather than politics .
This was the first publicity push by the oil sales and supply team in the eight years since he took over the reins as the global marketing chief , he said .
“ We probably are not as fast as some of the traders ... We want to make it up quickly so we can become a major supplier in the region , ” he told a seminar on Tuesday .
Martenak 's team has also met with potential teapot clients in private meetings this week , but their main purpose was to act as Exxon 's “ ambassador ” rather than cutting deals , he told Reuters at its booth .
New rules from the International Maritime Organization requiring ships to use low-sulphur fuel starting in 2020 will also likely boost China 's need for U.S. sweet , or low-sulphur , crude , he said .
CHARM OFFENSIVE
Exxon 's charm offensive is starting in Dongying , an oil town built in the 1960s on China 's second-largest oilfield . The city is now the country 's biggest refining centre with more 32 refineries and total annual refining capacity of 69 million tonnes , or about 1.38 million bpd .
China has nearly 40 independent refiners and since winning their import quotas three years ago they now buy one-fifth of China 's crude oil imports of 9.6 million bpd .
Most of China 's teapots are in Shandong , sucking in crude from West Africa , Russia , Oman and Brazil .
Exxon 's late arrival means they face competition from global peers such as BP and Royal Dutch Shell .
Additionally , global traders , Vitol , Trafigura and Mercuria were among the early movers to the teapot market . Their China-based traders make monthly visits to Shandong , which often involve entertaining over drinks before discussing deals .
BP 's China marketing team in Beijing and Shanghai is the largest among the international oil majors , followed by Shell .
“ ExxonMobil , like Chevron , are late comers in the Shandong market , ” said an independent refining executive at a plant in Dongying .
“ They are very strong in global supply sources , but compared to traders like Mercuria , Trafigura and Vitol , their knowledge of the local market is not as deep . ”

This team which has Shane Watson , Saeed Ajmal , Samuel Badree , Mohammad Sami and Brad Haddin — all over 35 years old but are players who can win matches even now . Haddin , now 39 , is batting brilliantly — showing no signs of an ageing cricketer . The support staff made up of Dean Jones ( head coach ) , Wasim Akram ( team director ) , Tauseef Ahmad ( assistant coach ) know what it takes to win matches . The loss of hard-hitting opener Sharjeel Khan , who has been suspended for alleged spot-fixing , is a big blow to the team though .
Peshawar has recovered well after their first defeat to Islamabad , mainly due to the form of England skipper Eoin Morgan and opener Dawid Malan . Darren Sammy as captain has been inspiring and the return of Mohammad Hafeez as a bowler has helped them too . Hasan Ali , their 23-year-old pacer has been spot on and played a vital role in their low scoring match win over Lahore on Sunday . Lahore has undoubtedly the best batting line-up on paper . The in-form Jason Roy and Brendon McCullum showed how destructive they can be as openers . They have also a mingy bowler in Grant Elliott , who through a four-wicket spell , was responsible for their win over Islamabad . The team has n't blossomed to its full strength , but will be the one to watch in Sharjah . It has been a bad start for Karachi Kings , which has lost both their matches . It is surprising why such a formidable batting line up made of Chris Gayle , skipper Kumar Sangakkara , Babar Azam , Kieron Pollard , Shoaib Malek and Ravi Bopara is unable to fire . Sangakkara feels their winning run is about to begin soon and this team is tying up some loose ends .

OSLO , Norway > > The Nobel Peace Prize was awarded Friday to the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons , a group of mostly young activists pushing for a global treaty to ban the cataclysmic bombs .
The award of the $ 1.1-million prize comes amid heightened tensions over both North Korea 's aggressive development of nuclear weapons and U.S. President Donald Trump 's persistent criticism of the deal to curb Iran 's nuclear program .
The prize committee wanted “ to send a signal to North Korea and the U.S. that they need to go into negotiations , ” Oeivind Stenersen , a historian of the peace prize , told The Associated Press . “ The prize is also coded support to the Iran nuclear deal . I think this was wise because recognizing the Iran deal itself could have been seen as giving support to the Iranian state . ”
The Geneva-based ICAN has campaigned actively for the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons , which was adopted by 122 countries at the United Nations in July . On Sept. 20 , the first day the treaty was open for signature , 51 countries signed it and three submitted their ratifications . The treaty needs 50 ratifications to go into force , which advocates are confident will happen .
The United States , Russia , Britain , France and China all boycotted the negotiations ; India , Pakistan and North Korea did not vote .
ICAN also organized events globally in 2015 to mark the 70th anniversaries of World War II 's devastating U.S. atomic bombing of the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki .
Last month in Berlin , ICAN protesters teamed up with other organizations to demonstrate outside the U.S. and North Korean embassies against the possibility of nuclear war between the two countries . Wearing masks of Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un , protesters posed next to a dummy nuclear missile and a large banner reading “ Time to Go : Ban Nuclear Weapons . ”
The group “ has been a driving force in prevailing upon the world 's nations to pledge to cooperate ... in efforts to stigmatize , prohibit and eliminate nuclear weapons , ” Norwegian Nobel Committee chairwoman Berit Reiss-Andersen said in the announcement .
The prize “ sends a message to all nuclear-armed states and all states that continue to rely on nuclear weapons for security that it is unacceptable behavior . We will not support it , we will not make excuses for it . We ca n't threaten to indiscriminately slaughter hundreds of thousands of civilians in the name of security . That 's not how you build security , ” ICAN executive director Beatrice Fihn told reporters Friday in Geneva .

She said that she “ worried that it was a prank ” after getting a phone call just minutes before the official Peace Prize announcement was made . Fihn said she did n't believe it until she heard the name of the group being proclaimed on television .
ICAN leaders later popped open some bubbly to celebrate the prize , and held up a banner with their group 's name in their small Geneva headquarters .
“ We are trying to send very strong signals to all states with nuclear arms , nuclear-armed states — North Korea , U.S. , Russia , China , France , U.K. , Israel , all of them , India , Pakistan — it is unacceptable to threaten to kill civilians , ” she said .
Reiss-Andersen noted that similar prohibitions have been reached on chemical and biological weapons , land mines and cluster munitions .
“ Nuclear weapons are even more destructive , but have not yet been made the object of a similar international legal prohibition , ” she said .
Reiss-Andersen said “ through its inspiring and innovative support for the U.N. negotiations on a treaty banning nuclear weapons , ICAN has played a major part in bringing about what in our day and age is equivalent to an international peace congress . ”
Asked by journalists whether the prize was essentially symbolic , given that no international measures against nuclear weapons have been reached , Reiss-Andersen said “ what will not have an impact is being passive . ”
Anita Friedt , the U.S. acting assistant secretary of state for arms control , told the U.N. General Assembly this week that it would be irresponsible for the U.S. to support the treaty , citing the threat from North Korea .
Jamey Keaten in Geneva , George Jahn in Vienna , Edith Lederer at the United Nations and Jim Heintz in Stockholm contributed to this story .
Several religious figures have also shown up , the most popular being a famous Buddhist monk , Kruba Boonchum , who when he first visited the scene had predicted that the boys would be found this week .
He returned Wednesday to offer prayers for their safe rescue , and as measure of the respect in which he was held , was allowed access to the cave , which is generally off-limits to outsiders .
SEAL commander Rear Admiral Arpakorn Yookongkaew said Tuesday that there was no rush to bring the group out of the cave , since they 're safe where they are . The current flooding situation means the boys would have to dive , which rescue experts have said could be extremely dangerous .
While efforts to pump out floodwaters are continuing , some Thai officials have indicated that heavy rains forecast for this weekend could force them to decide the boys should swim and dive out using the same complicated route of narrow passageways through which their rescuers entered .
Chiang Rai provincial Gov . Narongsak Osatanakorn said Wednesday that the boys have been practicing wearing diving masks and breathing , but he does n't believe they have attempted any practice dives .
He said it is unknown when an extraction could be attempted , but it is unlikely to be Wednesday .
`` If it 's risky or not safe , we will not proceed yet , '' Narongsak said . `` It has to be 100 per cent safe . ''
He also said the boys and their coach may not all be extracted at the same time , depending on their health . He said authorities will evaluate their readiness each day and if there is any risk will not proceed .
Authorities said they were still exploring other options , such as scouring the mountainside for other ways into the cave and finding faster ways to pump water from the cave .
Cave rescue experts have said it could be safest to simply supply the boys where they are for now , and wait for the water to go down . That could take months , however , given that Thailand 's rainy season typically lasts through October .
Experienced divers are wary of taking out the boys through the dark and dangerous waters still in the cave , especially since they are untrained .
`` We are talking kilometres of transport under the water with zero visibility , '' said Claus Rasmusen , a certified cave diving instructor based in Thailand who has been helping Thai SEAL team with logistics . `` It 's difficult . ''
He said it was awkward , but possible , to teach them minimal skills .
`` Nobody will teach anyone a full cave course , but trying to get them comfortable with masks , with the breathing , ( is ) completely different , '' he said . `` Creating an environment that can make them safely get away , that 's feasible . ''
Michigan is the top program in the state of Michigan , according to CBS Sports . ( Photo : David Guralnick / Detroit News )
It seems like , given the state of affairs at Michigan and Michigan State , picking the top football program in the state is pretty easy .
And , while CBS Sports made what seems like an obvious call in choosing Michigan as the top dog in choosing the top programs in each state Monday , it was n't a slam dunk , given MSU 's success not so long ago .
“ Tougher choice than you might think with Michigan State coming off a 3-9 season , ” Ben Kercheval of CBS Sports writes . “ Spartans coach Mark Dantonio has done a lot for that program , and he 's dominated his rival for the past decade . Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh still has a little something to prove . You can only finish third in your own division so many times , no matter how deep that division is . But , man , the way Michigan State fell to 3-9 in a hurry was concerning . ”
The emphasis was Kercheval 's , because of the Spartans ' woes last season follwing a College Football Playoff appearance after the 2015 season and , likely , their tumultuous offseason .
Michigan , meanwhile , has fashioned back-to-back 10-3 seasons since Harbaugh 's return to Ann Arbor , including a 32-23 victory over Michigan State last season , halting a stretch in which the Spartans had won seven of the last eight in the series .
The Wolverines have finished third in the Big Ten East the past two seasons .
ISLAMABAD , Jul 4 ( APP ) : As many as 60 European Union election observers are being trained , who will eventually be sent to different areas of Pakistan to monitor the general election 2018 .
This was informed by a two-member EU Election Observation Mission ( EU EOM ) -Pakistan 2018 comprising Media Analyst Inta Lase and Legal Analyst Colm Fahy , during a meeting with Associated Press of Pakistan ( APP ) Managing Director Masood Ahmed Malik here Wednesday .
The delegation explained that the mandate of the EU EOM was to observe all aspects of the electoral process and assess as to what extent the laws of Pakistan as well as its regional and international commitments were complied .
They said the observers would meet election officials , candidates and representatives of civil society and submit the reports based on their observation , to the core team in Islamabad . The exercise would help draw an independent and impartial conclusion about the election , they added .
The EU EOM members described it as a great opportunity to observe and analyze elections in Pakistan as part of EU Election Observation Mission ( EOM ) . The mission currently comprised a core team of 10 election analysts based in Islamabad , besides 60 long-term observers , for deployment across the country in early July .
Inta Lase underlined the importance of social media in the present election , saying the mission would be observing the election campaign , electoral process as well as the role of media in news dissemination and coverage of elections .
Earlier , APP Managing Director informed the delegation that conduct of free , fair and peaceful elections was the prime responsibility of the Election Commission of Pakistan . The caretaker federal and provincial governments were making all necessary arrangements and providing support to the ECP in discharge of its constitutional duties , he added .
He also mentioned to the Code of Conduct prepared by the ECP for contesting candidates , presiding officers , polling staff and media . The law enforcement agencies deployed across the country for maintaining peace during the election process , he added .
He informed the visiting delegation that the ECP had prepared a code of conduct for media in consultation with the representatives of media organizations to ensure objective coverage of the election .
He briefed the delegation about the APP 's organizational structure and functioning of its various services , including English , Urdu , Arabic , Siraiki , Pashto , Sindhi and Balochi .
He said APP was covering political activities of all political parties indiscriminately and ensuring that unbiased and authentic reports were disseminated to subscribers and general public .
Masood Malik said , ” The organization arranges workshops for its correspondents before every election for extensive coverage of general polls and takes full responsibility of its contents as it only releases error-free and credible news . ”
He said APP upheld excellent journalistic traditions by objective and accurate reporting while observing code of ethics with regard to responsible journalism .
“ We enjoy a leading role by supplying authentic and credible news to the print and electronic media round-the-clock . Around 900 news containing important events and developments are put on wire daily for onward consumption by its subscribers , ” he added .
Masood Malik said with strong editorial network at the headquarters , bureaus , stations as well as deployment of correspondents at district level , the news agency was rendering important professional contribution to cater to the requirements of print , electronic and pictorial media in various fields .
ISIS terrorists operate wherever America deploys them , most recently in the Philippines .
In response , President Duterte declared martial law in Mindanao , imposed military rule , and threatened to extend it nationwide .
Earlier he called Obama an SOB , “ announced ( his ) separation from the United States , ” said he ended joint military exercises with America , indicating he 's open to holding them with China and Russia .
Meeting with Rex Tillerson during the Asean Regional Forum , his tone markedly changed , calling himself Washington 's “ humble friend in Southeast Asia , ” saying :
“ I am happy to see you…and you have come at a time when the world is not so good , especially in the Korean peninsula , and of course , the ever-nagging problem of the South China Sea . ”
He praised Trump in contrast to bashing Obama . Perhaps he was instructed about the hazards of antagonizing Washington .
ISIS terrorists deployed to the Philippines is a matter of great concern , more serious if he authorizes US military action on the pretext of combating them .
According to NBC News , “ ( t ) he Pentagon is considering a plan that allows the US military to conduct airstrikes on ISIS in the Philippines , ” citing two unnamed Defense Department officials .
Supposedly they 'll be conducted by drones , maybe US warplanes to follow . According to NBC :
“ If approved , the US military would be able to conduct strikes against ISIS targets in the Philippines that could be a threat to allies in the region , which would include the Philippine forces battling ISIS on the ground in the country 's southern islands . ”
Currently , a so-called Pentagon Joint Special Operations Task Force Trident operates in the Philippines , small numbers of US forces involved , certain to grow larger if aerial operations begin .
Wherever US forces show up , mass slaughter and destruction follow . That 's what Duterte potentially faces if he allows Pentagon aerial attacks .
US terror-bombing in Afghanistan , Libya , Iraq and Syria killed thousands of defenseless civilians , maybe tens of thousands , injuring many more , displacing hundreds of thousands , causing the most severe refugee crisis since WW II .
If Duterte authorizes terror-bombing on the phony pretext of America combating ISIS , parts of the Philippines could be devastated like what happened in other US war theaters .
Instead of allying with Washington – supporting , not combating ISIS – he 'd be wise to seek help from Russia and China , reliable allies , unlike America , exploiting other countries , not helping them .
It 's a lesson the Philippines learned long ago in the 19th century . Has Duterte forgotten his country 's history ?
During America 's 1899 – 1902 war , Mark Twain wrote :
“ …I have seen that we do not intend to free , but to subjugate the people of the Philippines . We have gone there to conquer , not to redeem…And so I am an anti-imperialist . ”
“ I am opposed to having the eagle put its talons on any other land…We have pacified some thousands of the islanders and buried them ; destroyed their fields , burned their villages , turned their widows and orphans out-of-doors , ( and ) subjugated the remaining ten million by Benevolent Assimilation… ”
If he gets in bed with America militarily , Duterte will have far greater problem to handle than ISIS – Philippine sovereignty at stake .
A Final Comment
According to the Philippines National Democratic Front , the CIA and nation 's military intend ousting Duterte , fearing he may favor alliances with China and Russia over America .
Toppling foreign leaders is a CIA specialty , a rogue agency well-known for virtually every dirty trick imaginable .

EVEN before defeat against Ireland , Warren Gatland planted the seed , suggesting England could be heading for six successive losses .
In fairness to the Wales coach , his comment was n't random meddling but in response to England chief Eddie Jones ' insulting remark about his adopted country .
However , with the Red Rose duly humbled at home by Ireland on Saturday , the team tipped by many to challenge New Zealand for next year 's World Cup , have indeed now lost three consecutive matches .
It is certainly new ground for Jones , the Australian who has enjoyed such success since taking over at the end of 2015 , and with a tricky tour of South Africa looming this summer you can understand Gatland 's point about it soon becoming six .
“ I do n't know why he would be talking about our games ; he coaches Wales , ” was England winger Jonny May 's response .
“ We 'll see . I 'd be surprised if you do n't see a response from this group . I 'm sure we 're going to get better . I 'd back us every time .
Ireland 's Rory Best celebrates with the trophy after winning the grand slam during the NatWest 6 Nations match at Twickenham Stadium , London . ( Picture : Gareth Fuller/PA Wire )
“ We have n't expected to lose any of these games we have but we 'll keep working . I know that we are good enough to beat anybody – that 's the belief in our group .
“ There will definitely be more focus on us now – the pressure is going to come on this group because of the nature of what has happened .
“ This is why we need to stay tight and focus on what we can control and just treat them as separate games of rugby where we want to get better and win . ”
After defeats in Edinburgh and Paris were compounded by that 24-15 loss at Twickenham , England suffered their worst championship finish since 1983 .
You ca n't forget what we have done and what we can be but we have to start from the bottom up again . Jonny May
Understandably , three consecutive Tests against the Springboks , starting in Johannesburg on June 9 before trips to Bloemfontein and Cape Town , suddenly looks slightly more taxing for a side that lost just once in Jones ' opening 25 games in charge .
However , Leicester Tigers star May – who scored England 's third try in injury-time as they sprang to life too late on Saturday – views it differently .
He said : “ It 's a great opportunity . If we were to go out there and win a series then it would definitely be a step back in the right direction after taking a bit of a hit .
“ We have a lot of rebuilding to do because three ( losses ) in a row is n't good enough .
“ You ca n't forget what we have done and what we can be but we have to start from the bottom up again .
“ We 're not back at square one but we 've definitely taken a dip .
“ With that comes an opportunity to focus and learn and get better .
“ This team is still going to get better – there 's no doubt about that – but we were flying high and it 's going to take some hard work and a run of good games to get back to where we need to be before the World Cup . ”
Despite injuries to some key players , England had started as favourites to make it three consecutive Six Nations championship title wins .
Asked if he could believe , then , what had happened to England over the last month , May conceded : “ You would n't have guessed it , would you ?
“ It 's not what any of us were thinking would happen but there 's been a couple of areas that we 've mentioned .
“ The breakdown was better today but discipline killed us , especially against an Ireland team that thrives off penalties .
“ They 'll get some territory , put up a high ball , drive you back , get another penalty – that kind of thing .
“ It 's frustrating because it 's the type of thing we talk about in the week to look out for at the weekend but there were some better things today and you ca n't question the character and the ethic of the boys .
“ We 're a good group of guys and the run we 've had , we 've hit a bit of a speed bump but I have no doubt that the way we work and the group of boys that we 've got we can keep getting better and learn from this . ”
It remains to be seen if some will get that chance , though . Jones hinted that some of the fledgling players in his squad may not have enough time to get ready for the World Cup in Japan in 18 months . Having won his 34th cap , May does not fall into that category , but there are likely to be casualties . “ He has n't said that to us , ” said the 27-year-old .
“ It 's the same for all of us . We have to go back to our clubs and prove we are good enough to get picked and hopefully he 'll pick us . You 're never guaranteed to be in this group . Selection is for Eddie to worry about , not us . ”
England and Bath winger Anthony Watson 's season has been ended by an Achilles injury .
The 24-year-old was hurt during the first half of England 's defeat to Ireland on Saturday .
“ Anthony has been in superb form this year , and we 're obviously really disappointed to have lost him at a critical part of the season , ” said director of rugby Todd Blackadder .
Watson has scored 15 tries in 33 Tests for England .
Adult Swim has released a teaser trailer for Season 3 of the popular adult-themed science fiction cartoon Rick and Morty . Watch it now . The teaser trailer for Rick and Morty Season 3 features raw footage and unfinished animation . It was released during a live stream of the show 's development meeting with a guest writer . Scripts for Season 3 had been finished since August , but a planned release date of late 2016 for the full animated episodes fell through . In late December , the show 's creators revealed that one episode had been fully animated and completed . Fans knew there was no way a full season of Rick and Morty would be out by the end of the year . Rick And Morty Season 3 Release Date And News : To Arrive In First Week Of Jan 2017 , To… https : //t.co/lmL5CLw1TL pic.twitter.com/9d3F2rT9oD — MOBIPICKER.COM ( @ MOBIpicker ) December 23 , 2016 The current release of Season 3 is expected to be sometime in March 2017 . No official word has been spoken , but March 2017 is the date show insiders hope to release Rick and Morty Season 3 to the public . Fans hope that Adult Swim will at least announce the release date in January . The good news is that due to the popularity of the show , Season 3 is getting more episodes than previous seasons . Previous seasons consisted of a mere 10 episodes , but the newest season of Rick and Morty will have 14 episodes . The heavier workload may have put show creators behind . For whatever reason , the animation is not done and the release date for Rick and Morty has been delayed . Fans will just have to be patient for the highly acclaimed sitcom 's return to television . The series has a 100 % approval rating on review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes and a score of 9.3/10 on IMDB , making it the # 8 Top Rated TV Show on their list and only animated TV show to crack the Top 10 . Therefore , the producers of Adult Swim had a lot of incentive to release a third season of Rick and Morty and actually announced the green light on Season 3 when Season 2 had only aired three episodes . The uplifting nihilism of ‘ Rick & Morty ' https : //t.co/fKS2TTJxdg pic.twitter.com/FPEzRqHxJI — Splitsider ( @ Splitsider ) December 30 , 2016 That means there is definitely a market for Rick and Morty , and there is definitely a plan to air new episodes . We just do not know when they will come out . Producers have an incentive to hurry , but some of the show 's creative fans found the incentive to animate a Rick and Morty short of their own . In October of last year , fans of the series on a YouTube channel called “ tiarawhy ” animated the transcript of an actual court case in the style of the show and with its titular characters . Their animation was based on an animatic , which is like a storyboard , put up on the Adult Swim channel after creators found the transcript of the case and adapted it as though it took place between the Rick and Morty characters themselves . The bizarre transcript between the judge and a convict escalates into a shouting match , and is just the strange sort of humor that Rick and Morty relies on for laughs . Adult Swim describes the popular show on their website . “ Rick and Morty is Adult Swim 's most scientifically accurate animated comedy . Created by Justin Roiland and Dan Harmon , it catalogues the bizarre misadventures of bored scientific genius/drunkard Rick and his socially awkward grandson , Morty . Their exploits tend to have unintended consequences for Morty 's dysfunctional family. ” Other prominent characters in the show are Morty 's parents , Beth and Jerry , his sister Summer , and his love interest , Jessica . The characters travel to different parts of the universe in Rick 's spaceship and go on wacky adventures . One of the hotly debated points among fans is whether Season 3 will pick up where Season 2 left off , when Rick was thrown into a Galactic Federation prison , or if the series will continue in the typically non-linear fashion of the rest of its episodes .

LIMA ( Reuters ) - Peru said on Friday it was expelling Venezuela 's ambassador to Peru to protest the country 's recent formation of an all-powerful constituent assembly that has been widely condemned as a power grab by socialist President Nicolas Maduro .
Venezuela responded by ordering the charge d'affaires at the Peruvian embassy in Caracas to leave the country within five days . Peru withdrew its ambassador to Venezuela in March .
Peru 's announcement on Friday , shortly after President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski called Maduro a `` dictator '' , marked the first time that a country has moved to expel a Venezuelan ambassador since the country 's July 30 vote to form the constituent assembly amid allegations of fraud .
In Latin America , Peru has taken the toughest stance toward Maduro as he seeks to consolidate power and crack down on anti-government protests and unrest that have left 120 dead since April .

Earlier this week , Peru summoned top diplomats from the region to discuss Venezuela in Lima , Peru 's capital , where 12 nations condemned the `` rupture of democratic order '' in Venezuela and said they would not recognise any action taken by the constituent assembly .
Maduro has said the constituent assembly is the country 's only chance at securing peace and prosperity .
Venezuela called Kuczynski , a former Wall Street banker , `` an enemy of the country , for continually interfering in the domestic affairs of Venezuela . ''
`` The Venezuelan government will continue to deepen relations with the heroic Peruvian people despite the actions of the elite that governs Peru , '' Venezuela 's foreign ministry said in a statement . It added that its ambassador to Peru , Diego Molero , was in Venezuela .
The escalating rhetoric came as U.S. President Donald Trump threatened military intervention in Venezuela , which Venezuela called `` an act of craziness . ''
QUETTA , Pakistan ( Reuters ) - Three suicide bombers attacked Pakistani police and paramilitary soldiers in the southwestern city of Quetta on Tuesday , killing six police and wounding 15 members of the security forces , officials said .
One bomber detonated his explosives near a police truck , provincial police chief Moazzam Jah Ansari said . Seven police officers were wounded in that attack .
“ It is a suicide attack , and we have a confirmation that six of our police officials are dead , ” Ansari told Reuters .
Half an hour earlier , two suicide bombers tried to attack a paramilitary checkpoint on the city 's outskirts , but troops deployed there engaged them , a paramilitary officer said .
He said the troops had opened fire at the attackers , who detonated their explosives , wounding eight soldiers . Both the suicide bombers died , he said on condition of anonymity because the army was due to issue an official statement .
No one immediately claimed responsibility for the attacks .
Quetta is the capital city of the southwestern province of Baluchistan , which has been plagued by violence .
Islamist militants linked to the Taliban , al Qaeda and Islamic State have been operating in the province , which borders Iran as well as Afghanistan . It also has an indigenous ethnic Baloch insurgency fighting the central government .
Islamic State has created a branch in Pakistan and Afghanistan , mostly by recruiting among break away factions of other established militant groups . Its followers have claimed some of Pakistan 's most deadly recent attacks .
Six members of Pakistan 's tiny Christian minority community , four of them from the same family , and two people from the Shi'ite Muslim minority were gunned down in Quetta this month .
In December two suicide bombers stormed a packed church in southwestern Pakistan , killing at least 10 people and wounding up to 56 .
Pakistan a nuclear armed nation of 208 million people has for some time seen a decrease in militant violence , but the Islamists , who want to install their own harsh brand of Islamic law , remain potent .
APHA Amateur Rules Simplified
[ source : APHA.com ]
Showing multiple horses in various divisions–even just remembering your pattern–can be a challenge in itself . Throw in remembering rules for entering in different Amateur age divisions and classes can further complicate your show day . Before you saddle up , make sure you know the ins and outs of showing your Paint in APHA 's Amateur division .
APHA recognizes two divisions for Amateurs : Amateur ( 19 & over ) and Masters Amateur ( 45 & over ) . A Masters Amateur exhibitor may show in both Amateur and Masters Amateur at a show , so long as the same horse is not shown in both age divisions for the same class at a particular show .
An Amateur and Masters Amateur exhibitors may show up to three different horses in individual working events , like trail and western riding . However , the rules above still apply—a Masters Amateur can not show the same horse in the same event , even if it 's in a different age group . For example , a Masters Amateur may show two horses in the Amateur trail and a different horse in the Masters Amateur trail .
A Masters Amateur exhibitor may show two horses in rail/group classes—one horse in Amateur and another horse in Masters Amateur
Year-end awards are tabulated and organized based on the age of the exhibitor . For example , if a Masters Amateur shows in Amateur Hunter Under Saddle , the points earned will go toward the Masters Amateur Hunter Under Saddle Honor Roll .
Show management has the right to combine the two Amateur age divisions if either has five or fewer entries . If so , Masters Amateur exhibitors must choose one horse to show in the age-combined class .
Check out this link for a helpful handout containing examples that might help you make the correct decisions when addressing the APHA Amateur rules , whether you are an exhibitor , show secretary or show manager .
A body was discovered in a rural area east of Clare in Webster County on Saturday afternoon .
The Iowa Division of Criminal Investigation is assisting the Webster County Sheriff 's Department in the investigation . An autopsy is to be performed on the body . The name of the victim has not been released until all relatives are notified .
Last week , the sheriff 's department received a report of two missing individuals , 26-year-old Jessica Gomez of Fort Dodge and 26-year-old Mackenzie Knigge of Clare . Knigge was found safe last Thursday in Indiana . Gomez is still missing , but officials have not commented on whether her disappearance is connected to the body found Saturday near Clare .

Marco Engel is living his best life . The 32-year-old German gent has been racing under the Mercedes-AMG colors for some time now . Over the course of his career , Engel has competed in karting , GT racing , V8 Supercars , the various major endurance races , Formula E , and DTM . That last one is important because it 's where Engel met his now-wife Steffi . It 's also important because Marco and Steffi just used a DTM car to drive off from their wedding .
The sky was blue . The newlyweds were smiling . The air around them was ... loud ? Yes , because a Mercedes-AMG C63 DTM racing car was ready to shuttle the freshly married Engels off to their next destination .
Marco Engel and his wife Steffi drove away from their wedding in a Mercedes-Benz DTM race car Enlarge Photo
Mercedes offered up the DTM racer to Marco and his wife to use as a wedding shuttle . Marco wisely asked his bride-to-be what she thought of the idea , and she told him to jump on it . They met in the DTM world and now a DTM race car would help them celebrate on their wonderful day .
White tablecloths were place inside to cover up the seats . Large grins were plastered on the faces of Marco and Steffi immediately after that , because the car was driven for a half hour after leaving the church . The newlyweds apparently took the race car down country roads , through a small fishing village , and out toward the coast .
There would be only smiles while driving the car , of course . As it 's so loud that the pair could n't talk to each other for the drive . Regardless , this might be the best vehicle ever ushered into wedding duty .

GOP Baseball Practice Shooting : Lawmaker Saw Gunman `` Taking Aim At Us '
Rep. Mo Brooks of South Carolina was on the baseball field when a gunman started shooting at a GOP baseball practice Wednesday morning . Brooks tells NPR he sought cover in a dugout with others .
STEVE INSKEEP , HOST :
Alexandria , Va. , police say they received a call at 7:09 this morning . 7:09 was when they received a call about gunshots being fired at a baseball diamond , a baseball diamond where more than 20 senators and representatives were practicing early this morning . Chief Michael Brown is talking now , holding a press conference . And let 's bring that in and just listen to a little bit of that .
( SOUNDBITE OF PRESS CONFERENCE )
UNIDENTIFIED MAN # 1 : Thank you , Chief . I would like to first start out by thanking the Alexandria Police .
INSKEEP : OK , we 're not hearing very much there from Chief Michael Brown . We 'll see if we can get a better feed of that . And whenever we can , we will let you know . But Chief Brown actually just wrapped up his statement . He did make a statement that Alexandria , Va. , police received a call at 7:09 . They responded to the scene . They were among those who returned fire upon a gunman .
And we know from other witnesses - we know from a number of witnesses that more than 50 shots , according to the witnesses , were fired by a gunman who had at least one weapon , possibly more according to some descriptions , shot and wounded five people on that baseball diamond , including Steve Scalise , representative of Louisiana , the No . 3 House Republican . He is described as - and he will - his office is saying that he will recover . But he was shot and seriously wounded . A number of other people , including law enforcement officers , were wounded as well .
RACHEL MARTIN , HOST :
Yeah , we understand that Steve Scalise is currently in surgery and at least two Capitol Hill Police officers were also shot in this morning 's shooting .
INSKEEP : And now let 's go to Representative Mo Brooks of Alabama . He is one of the lawmakers who was - well , he was on the baseball diamond this morning practicing baseball .
Congressman , glad you 're OK .
MO BROOKS : Thank you .
INSKEEP : Can you just describe what happened first ?
BROOKS : Well , I was engaged in batting practice , probably around 7 o'clock . I was on the third-base side of home plate . And I heard this loud blam along the third baseline , just on the other side of the third base dugout , which was cinderblock . And I looked over there , and then I see the rifle . It 's up against the fence or maybe through the fence , but it 's shooting through the fence holes , chain-link fence .
And I hear someone scream , active shooter . I think I heard Steve Scalise also scream . He might have been the first thing I heard . Apparently , he was shot very early in the process . He was shot in the - I think it was the left hip . You know , I 'm frozen for a second as I ca n't believe that this is actually a gun that is being discharged at the congressmen and congressional staff that are on the field . I can see the shooter now . And all this has probably taken place in a second or two , but it seemed a lot longer .
INSKEEP : Can you ...
BROOKS : And I realized ...
INSKEEP : ... Can you describe ...
BROOKS : ... That I 'm about ...
INSKEEP : .... When you say you can see the shooter , what did you see ? Where was he exactly ? What did he have in his hands ?
BROOKS : He had , in his hands , the rifle that he was using to target congressmen and congressional staff . He was probably 10 , 15 , 20 feet , some distance past the third base dugout on the outside of the field on the opposite side of the screen , chain-link fence . And he is taking aim at various individuals . And at that moment , it occurred to me - and this is probably three or four or five seconds in at most . Time seems to slow down .
INSKEEP : Yeah .
BROOKS : I was able to see that he was taking aim at us . And I recognized that if I can see him , if he turns his field of view about 20 to 30 degrees to his right , I 'm his closest target because I 'm on the third-base side of home plate with a baseball bat in my hand . So I immediately , recognizing the risk , ran around home plate and the batting cage . It 's got a netting above the home plate area . That 's to catch foul balls . But the bottom of it , it 's about 4 foot high of plastic , blue plastic .
So I hit the ground behind that plastic . There were some other members of - congressmen or senators , staffers who were also on the ground - two or three or four others . And the shooter with the gun , of course , keeps shooting . You hear a lot of screaming going on . And it occurred to me that if that shooter walks towards home plate around the outside of the dugout , we 're going to be lying on the ground about 15 to 20 feet where he 'll have a clear shot at us .
INSKEEP : Yeah .
BROOKS : And at some point , I made the decision - I do n't know if others who were lying on the ground with me made the decision at the same time - but we got up . And we dove into the first base dugout . So we were in an open area , open to the shooter 's aim , line of fire , for about 15 yards , 20 yards , whatever that distance is from home plate to the first base dugout . And we dove into the dugout .
The dugout is recessed about a foot and a half , 2 feet down . So now you 're below ground . But if the shooter - if he does make it to home plate , outside the field still , he 'll have a clear line of sight into that dugout . While I 'm lying , taking cover on the ground , the floor of the dugout , I noticed that one of our staffers - and I wish I could remember his name . But normally , I would , but right now I ca n't .
INSKEEP : Understood .
BROOKS : He 's bleeding from his leg . He 's been shot in the calf . He 's a real trooper . He 's saying , hey , you know , I 'm OK. Do n't worry about me . But I see that blood flowing out , so I pulled the belt off of my shorts . And myself and another gentleman applied it as a tourniquet to help slow down the blood flow .
This is while the gunfire is going on . But , you know , we ca n't see the shooter now . We 're below ground level just a little bit , keeping our heads low . And then I look over to my right a little bit - still looking at the dirt - and hearing gunshots coming from my right , about 5 feet from my head - 5 , 6 , 7 feet . I 'm going , oh , my goodness , a second shooter . But this one , fortunately ...
INSKEEP : And that was the Capitol ?
BROOKS : Yeah , so it was a Capitol Police officer who was using our cinderblock dugout as cover . And he was shooting from around the edge . Now , keep in mind , he 's shooting almost all the way across the baseball diamond . And it 's a rifle over a significant distance against two security Capitols Police officers with pistols .
INSKEEP : Congressman , I 'm obliged to ...
BROOKS : It 's not a real fair fight .
INSKEEP : ... I 'm obliged to stop you there for a moment . If you 'll stay on the line , we 'd like to come back after a short break , which we 're required to take for our NPR stations , and hear ...
BROOKS : I understand .
INSKEEP : ... A little bit more of your story . We are talking with Congressman Mo Brooks of Alabama on this morning of a shooting outside Washington .

The aftermath of a motorcycle crash in Vancouver on Monday morning . ( Canadian Press photo )
A female stunt driver working on the movie “ Deadpool 2 ” has died after witnesses say she appeared to lose control of a motorcycle before crashing into a window of a building in downtown Vancouver .
A crumpled motorcycle was seen laying on its side surrounded by broken glass a few metres from the smashed window of the Shaw Tower near the city 's waterfront . Crew members appeared distraught and one was in tears .
“ She lost control really quickly . It happened in a split second , ” said Nathan Kramchynski , who works inside the Shaw building and watched the accident from the seventh floor on Monday morning .
He said he had been watching rehearsals of the stunt across the street outside the Vancouver Convention Centre . The stuntwoman had been riding slowly down a set of stairs and stopping when she reached the road , he said .
When it looked like the crew was ready to film the scene , Kramchynski and his coworkers rushed over to the window to watch . But that time , the driver suddenly picked up speed and crossed the street , he said .
“ She kind of weaved through , almost hit a pedestrian , ” he said . “ She was going full throttle and then there 's a building there . ”
Sharmina Kermalli was in a Starbucks on the ground floor of the tower when she heard a loud crash . She ran toward the noise and saw a woman lying inside the building , across where the glass panel had been .
Shards were still falling on the woman , and people were running over and picking glass off her face , Kermalli said .
Kermalli said just moments earlier she had walked by the spot where the crash happened .
“ I was thinking , what if I was just five seconds ( later ) , ” she said .
Deadpool , a Marvel Comics superhero , is played by Vancouver-born actor Ryan Reynolds . He posted a message to Twitter on Monday .
“ Today , we tragically lost a member of our crew while filming Deadpool . We 're heartbroken , shocked and devastated … but recognize nothing can come close to the grief and inexplicable pain her family and loved ones must feel in this moment , ” he said .
“ My heart pours out to them — along with each and every person she touched in this world . ”
A spokesman for 20th Century Fox issued a statement Monday that said , “ We are deeply saddened by the accident that occurred on the set of Deadpool 2 this morning . Our hearts and prayers are with the family , friends and colleagues of our crew member during this difficult time . ”
Vancouver police officers were at the scene and investigators with WorkSafeBC , the provincial workplace safety agency , were also looking into the crash .
Kramchynski , the witness who watched from the seventh floor , said a fire truck and police cars arrived “ instantly ” after the crash happened .
“ The response was actually incredible , ” he said .
He said he watched as the stunt woman was carried on a stretcher into the ambulance , which remained at the scene for about 15 or 20 minutes before leaving .
Later on Monday , the motorcycle was removed from the area and the broken glass was swept up .
The crash happened just half a block from the scene of an accident on Sunday where a bus hit several pedestrians , killing one man and injuring two others .

“ Get Out ” writer-director Jordan Peele admitted that he was n't fully prepared for the emotional impact of the comedy-horror movie — even as he was shooting it .
“ I would get to this point of crying and I would have a catharsis , ” Peele said at Saturday 's Meet the Nominees panel at the Directors Guild of America Theater in Los Angeles before a capacity crowd of more than 500 people .
Peele said that as a first-time director , he felt it was crucial for him to find the emotional truth of the scene . “ If their performance was n't getting these , it 's because I was n't getting there , ” he noted .
“ I came about this project in a very mischievous away , ” Peele added . “ It was about being provocative and doing what you 're not supposed to do and scaring the s— out of people , but as I got farther into it , the reality of what it was really about hit me in several stages : what happens to the victims of racial violence and the victims of a self-imposed psychological chamber . ”
Peele was joined at the event by other nominees for the DGA feature film award — Guillermo del Toro for “ The Shape of Water , ” Greta Gerwig for “ Lady Bird , ” Martin McDonaugh for “ Three Billboards Outside Ebbing , Missouri ” and Christopher Nolan for “ Dunkirk. ” Peele is also nominated for the DGA 's first-time director award .

The winners will be announced Saturday night at the Beverly Hilton at the 70th Annual DGA Awards . Jeremy Kagan , who moderated , noted that it was first time that all five nominees were also the writers on their films . The three-hour discussion focused on the intricacies of casting , rehearsals , music and where the director is during the shoot .
Del Toro lavished credit on his cast , noting that his casting process focuses on whether the actor can provide the emotional core a film needs . “ A really great actor can be wrong for a part , ” he added .
He recalled that a key scene in which Sally Hawkins hits Richard Jenkins was the result of him not telling Jenkins that she was going to do so . “ That 's why he sounds so surprised when he says ‘ You hit me , ' ” he added .

YOKOHAMA , Japan ( Reuters ) - Thousands of Pokémon Go players gathered in the Japanese port city of Yokohama to try their hand at catching rare virtual creatures while watching dance shows featuring people dressed as giant Pikachus .
Pokémon Go is a smartphone-based game , which requires players to 'catch ' virtual creatures , one of the best-known of which is the mouse-like Pikachu , by going to real-world locations where the game places them .

The festival , which is jointly organized by Yokohama city and The Pokémon Company , features a total of 15,000 Pikachus and will end on Aug. 15 , the event organizers said .
More such events will be held in Japan in the lead up to the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games , they added .
At the Pokémon Go Park , the festival 's main venue , visitors on Wednesday stopped by hoping to defeat players of the augmented reality game from Japan and beyond .
One player , 15-year-old Geoffery Morris , said the area was so busy the servers were often down .
Last month , nearly 20,000 people gathered at the first-ever Pokémon Go Fest in Chicago , causing the servers to crash due to congestion . The game 's developer Niantic later postponed a number of events in Europe .
The game became a global sensation upon its release in 2016 , breaking records for mobile app downloads and revenue . The game 's developers say that it has been downloaded 650 million times world wide since its release .
If you were looking for The Bachelor spoilers on ABC 's pre-season special , you were likely disappointed , but the network did succeed in hyping up the new season last night .
Nick Viall is the new bachelor and there 's going to be a whole lot of drama during his season of the ABC hit .
The dude is on to his fourth attempt at finding love on national TV , and not everyone is happy about his presence .
We kicked things off with a montage of the three women from the franchise Nick had fallen for over the years . As you probably know if you watch The Bachelorette online , all of his prior relationships never quite stood the test of time .
Things got pretty tense when the producers thought it was a good idea to send Nick to a booth in which fans lined up to give him a piece of their mind . Nick 's casting was met with a polarizing reception from fans of the show .
Most of the reaction stemmed from the way Nick had acted in previous seasons . There was very little positive reception and that will probably worry the producers of the series . Might this be the year the series …read more

Yet another water pump in North Kona has failed , making it five in the last few months .
The pump that failed today was the largest .
Even Hawaii County Mayor Harry Kim calls it “ unbelievable ” …
Now all North Kona businesses and residents are under a mandated emergency water restriction tonight .
An official from the Hawaii County Department of Water Supply says they believe 30-thousand people and businesses are impacted by this water shortage .
People in that area still have water , but are urged to consume less of it .
Hawaii County announced at about 11:30 a.m. Saturday that the Honokohau deepwell pump shut down . It is investigating what caused the failure .
The county says all residents and customers in North Kona must restrict water use immediately . People are being asked to only use water for health and safety needs only , which include drinking , cooking and hygiene .
Residents should stop using water for irrigation , washing cars and boats , and the like .
“ In each of the repairs it 's the motors that has given us issues . There are things like the motor thrust bearing that supports the weight and everything above it , and in previous projects we 've seen that fail , ” Kawika Uyehara , deputy manager of the county Department of Water Supply , explains .
“ A repair is not known at this time how long it 's gon na take because the pump literally has to be pulled out of the shaft and make a review of what the problem is . Worst case scenario , if the pump has to be shipped to the mainland obviously you can see how long it will take to repair that pump , ” Kim said .
The Department of Water Supply says it will suspend service to all temporary service and irrigation accounts .
That means farmers will not be able to irrigate their farmland at this time .
The last time one of the pumps broke , farmers could n't irrigate their land for about a week .
Once the county knows why the deepwell failed , it can work on bringing it back online , and it will better know how long that will take .
KHON2 News will be following up with this story and bring you the latest .
( Reuters ) - Former Cameroon international Benjamin Massing , whose crunching tackles at the World Cup in 1990 earned him an infamous reputation , died aged 55 on Sunday , local media reported .
The defender 's scything body check on Claudio Caniggia in the opening game against Argentina in Milan was later dubbed the worst tackle in World Cup history .
It reinforced an unwanted reputation of defensive brutality that surrounded Cameroon 's unprecedented run to the quarter-finals of the tournament , going further than any African side had done before .
Massing was sent off in the opening game of the 1990 World Cup and sat out the next three , but returned to play against England in the last eight in Naples where he gave away a penalty for a tackle on Gary Lineker as Cameroon were beaten 3-2 in extra time .
Massing , who played in France at Creteil , won 34 caps for his country between 1986 and 1992 .
The cause of his death was not reported .

One man killed , two injured in shooting occurred in the Spanish city of Barcelona , media reported Monday .
MOSCOW ( Sputnik ) — According to El Pais newspaper , the emergency service received information on shooting late on Sunday . The attackers are believed to open fire from a car parked near the victims ' car . A 30-year old man succumbed to injure , two other victims were taken to the hospital .
The police sources told the newspaper that they considered the attackers to be of Dominican origin .

More than two months later , one person is dead in California , 75 others have been hospitalized and federal authorities still do n't know where a nasty strain of E. coli bacteria latched onto romaine lettuce from Yuma , Ariz .
The first food poisoning cases came to light in late March — eight patrons of fast-food restaurants in New Jersey suffered bloody diarrhea and cramps that sent them rushing to hospitals .
“ I often describe that as food traceability at the speed of thought — as quickly as you can think it , we can know it , ” said Frank Yiannas , vice-president of food safety for Walmart , which is scaling up an IBM-driven pilot blockchain that already includes top suppliers such as Unilever , Nestle and Danone .
Food safety advocates and industry insiders say it may be time to borrow the encrypted accounting platform that drives cryptocurrency : blockchain .
Their struggle to trace dozens of supply lines across 32 states , on a paper trail that often may actually be on paper , demonstrates the limits of tracing food by methods rooted in another century .
“ Up until that point , I only knew that it was the technology behind bitcoin , ” Yiannas said . “ I will tell you I was a bit of a skeptic , just like many people are about the technology . ”
Not long ago , Yiannas , who guards the integrity of food in Walmart 's $ 280-billion ( U.S. ) grocery empire , would have brushed off the notion of an instantly “ knowable ” and verifiable food chain as fantasy . He heard about it two years ago , when Walmart was about to open a food safety institute in China , where 10 years ago , a baby formula adulteration scandal sickened 54,000 babies .
“ If I want to change something or fudge something on my version of the ledger , I then have to share it with everybody else and they all have to agree to that , ” Yiannas said . “ You ca n't have two separate sets of books . It 's one set of books that everyone sees . ”
Blockchain , for all its cloak-and-dagger associations , is basically a democratized accounting system made possible by advances in data encryption . Rather than storing proprietary data behind traditional security walls , companies contribute encrypted blocks of data to a “ distributed ” ledger that can be monitored and verified by each farmer , packer , shipper , distributor , wholesaler and retailer of produce . No one can make a change without everyone knowing , and agreeing to it .
As it stands , no one can see the entire path from farm to fork .
Each time a food-borne illness breaks out — which tends to happen around 900 times a year — investigators have to work their way backward , one link at a time , from victims to fields , tracing multiple paths across separate companies and sometimes across international borders .
“ It 's very linear , but the food system as we know is not very linear , ” Yiannas said .
That linear approach can cost lives and waste billions of dollars in health-care costs , lost work hours , and trashed food every year , health officials and analysts say . Food-borne illnesses can cost the U.S. economy $ 152 billion a year , with tainted produce responsible for a quarter of that damage , according to a Pew Charitable Trust study .
Take mangoes . The increasingly popular fruit grows on small farms scattered across Latin America , and can harbour listeria , a bacterium that kills 260 people per year in the U.S. , according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .
Two years ago , Yiannas told his staff to trace a packet of sliced mango from a Walmart aisle the traditional way .
“ I looked at my clock and wrote down the time and date , and I timed them , ” he said . “ It took them six days , 18 hours and 26 minutes . ”
Under a week is considered fast by the current link-by-link method known as “ one up , one back ” tracking , said Yiannas , who previously headed Walt Disney World 's health and safety program . Walmart has a sophisticated tracking system for its part of the supply line .
Beyond the walls of Walmart 's distribution centres , though , record-keeping can get hazy .
“ Believe it or not , it 's still largely done on paper , ” Yiannas said . “ It 's done many different ways by many different actors . ”
It took a month to build the blockchain network , which depends on co-operative partners agreeing on what information to contribute . By then , Yiannas felt confident enough to pull off the test live at a stockholder meeting last summer .
“ It was n't staged , ” he said . “ We had a backup in case the technology failed . ”
It worked — they mapped the mango supply line in 2.2 seconds .
The next day , Walmart started contacting suppliers . “ I think we 're onto something here , ” Yiannas told them .
Driscoll 's berries was among the first companies to join Walmart 's blockchain pilot , along with Nestle , Danone , Unilever and others .
Based in Watsonville , Calif. , Driscoll 's grows berries in nearly two dozen countries , making it by far the biggest berry supplier worldwide .
Almost immediately , Driscoll 's saw a lot more than food safety in blockchain . A fully built-out ledger could one day get berries to shelves faster , figure out what varieties last longest , trim waste and even pay suppliers more quickly , the company believes .
“ We want to drill down and continuously improve and understand : If we fell flat somewhere , why ? Or if we did really well somewhere else , why ? And then constantly refine our operations to be better , ” said Tim Jackson , the company 's vice-president of food safety and compliance .
Driscoll 's also foresees a day when consumers could tap into some of that information .
In the case of the romaine outbreak , consumers complained that they had no idea how to find out if they were buying lettuce from Yuma ( although , if you eat romaine in early spring , there 's a 90 per cent chance it came from the desert valleys straddling the lower Colorado River , from Yuma into California 's Imperial Valley ) .
“ To say to consumers that you should n't be consuming romaine lettuce if it came from the Yuma area and yet that information at the point of consumption or the point of purchase is n't readily available or obvious to the consumer , then that 's a problem , ” said Stephen Ostroff , deputy commissioner for food and veterinary medicine at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration .
Blockchain , first developed in the 1990s , was considered some dark art in the world of cryptocurrency in 2010 , when U.S. Congress passed the Food Safety Modernization Act , the first major overhaul of the nation 's deeply fragmented food safety regulation since the 1930s .
The law required the FDA to identify high-risk foods and require companies to keep better records of them . The agency has yet to write those rules — and they have been further delayed by the Trump administration 's wholesale rollback of regulation .
“ Seven years after the enactment of FSMA , the FDA has yet to carry out Congress 's mandate to create a list of high-risk foods and issue a proposed rule for enhanced record-keeping , ” a coalition of food safety advocates said in a letter to the agency last week .
The groups noted that leafy greens were responsible for more cases of E. coli illness than any other produce — a general category that accounted for half or more of the outbreaks of listeria , E. coli and salmonella , and a third of the campylobacter outbreaks reported from 2009 to 2013 .
Ostroff said implementing the remaining FSMA regulations “ would help , but it would n't necessarily solve the problem ” presented by such a broad outbreak .
“ At each point of that supply chain , you potentially are looking at hundreds and hundreds of records , ” he said . “ Many of those records are stored and available in different ways , ranging from very sophisticated electronic systems ... to handwritten records . And they 're in different formats . ”
Meanwhile , the offending lettuce is gone — consumed , or long ago tossed away after its 21-day shelf life expired , the FDA has said . No more lettuce is being grown in Yuma , either , according to the FDA , which cited industry sources .
“ Even as we were hearing about these cases , the product that they actually consumed either in their home or in a restaurant was n't available for us to test , ” Ostroff said .
Yiannas believes blockchain could have led investigators to likely culprits long before the lettuce vanished .
“ Walmart is not chasing blockchain because it 's a new fad or it 's a shiny coin , ” Yiannas said . “ The romaine incident is a perfect example of a real-world scenario where if tools were available , it might be managed a bit more effectively . ”

FOXBOROUGH , Mass . -- Wednesday marks the first day that NFL teams can assign the franchise or transition tag on players , and the primary question with the New England Patriots is if the team does so with linebacker Dont ' a Hightower .
A few key points :
The window to tag players extends from Feb. 15 to March 1
Teams can use only one tag each offseason
There are two types of franchise tags : non-exclusive ( most common ) and exclusive
The transition tag is a lesser option that is the average of the top 10 salaries at the position and allows the team right of first refusal on any offer a free agent might receive
What will the Patriots do with Hightower ? Let 's break down the options .
Case for assigning Hightower the franchise tag
Hightower 's value to the Patriots was highlighted with his exceptional second-half performance in Super Bowl LI . He 's a defensive captain , signal-caller , and is in his prime ( turning 27 in March ) , which are all positives when it comes to a team making a big financial investment . Using the tag would essentially ensure his return in 2017 ( it 's hard to imagine a team signing him to an offer sheet and giving up draft-pick compensation if the Patriots do n't match ) , which should help the defense continue to make positive strides after its strong finish to the 2016 season . While the goal would be a longer-term contract extension , the Patriots could use the tag to buy more time to strike that deal , similar to what they did with Vince Wilfork in 2010 . One issue , however , is that Hightower might be more inclined to play on the one-year tag with a chance to hit the open market again in 2018 .
Case for not assigning Hightower the franchise tag
While the exact franchise-tag figure for linebackers is yet to be determined -- it ca n't be calculated until the NFL officially sets the salary cap -- it is expected to be in the range of $ 14.5 million to $ 15 million . That 's a significant number which would rank No . 1 on the team ahead of quarterback Tom Brady ( $ 14 million ) and left tackle Nate Solder ( $ 11.1 million ) . Absorbing that cap charge , despite the Patriots ' abundant cap space , could restrict their ability to make some other moves they would otherwise have the flexibility to make . When safety Devin McCourty was a free agent two years ago , the Patriots elected against using the franchise tag to avoid a large one-year cap charge , then entered a competitive open-market situation before signing him to a long-term deal at the last moment . That could be their thinking with Hightower as well if they choose this route .
Case for assigning Hightower the transition tag
Because the franchise tag figure is projected to be in the $ 14.5-15 million range , the transition tag would be a more affordable fallback option ( projected to be in the $ 11 million range ) for the team while it worked toward a potential long-term deal with Hightower . The transition tag would give the Patriots the right of first refusal on any contract Hightower might receive in free agency , thus providing the club some leverage . The potential issue , though , is that the team would be allowing another club to dictate terms of a contract it would be absorbing . Nonetheless , if the Patriots feel confident they are in position to match any offer -- and feel the best strategic approach is to let the market dictate what Hightower ultimately receives -- this could be the team 's best course of action .

Source : Minimum speed limits , licence points docking on course – Sunday News Apr 16 , 2017
Tinomuda Chakanyuka , Senior Reporter
THE Government is working on a law that will see traffic offenders accumulating demerit points that will result in their drivers ' licences being revoked as part of measures to curb reckless driving that has contributed to road accidents .
In addition , new traffic signs stipulating minimum speed limits will also be erected on certain stretches of highways after it was discovered that some accidents were caused by slow drivers . Those caught driving below the minimum speed limit will be fined . At the moment regulations to do with speed was focusing on maximum speed only . Traffic Safety Council of Zimbabwe spokesperson Mr Ernest Muchena told Sunday News that the envisaged new traffic law would introduce a driving offence penalty points system . The driving offence penalty points system is one in which authorities issue points to drivers which will be docked on conviction for road traffic offences .
If a driver repeatedly contravenes traffic laws and exhausts their allocated points they may be disqualified from driving for a time , or their driving licence may be revoked . Mr Muchena said the Minister of Transport and Infrastructural Development , Dr Jorum Gumbo , has put in place an all stakeholders committee , led by the TSCZ to start the process of crafting the new law .
He said the committee will hold wide consultations with other stakeholders as it comes up with an outline of traffic offences that will be covered under the points system .
“ According to the Road Traffic Act chapter 13:11 the minister is allowed to craft a statutory instrument which puts into effect a penalty points system . For example the system may start with each driver at 15 points and when someone transgresses the law , say drinking under the influence of alcohol , three points will be deducted and they are left with 12 points . If you continue transgressing the law more points will be deducted and if one gets to zero , their licence is taken away , ” he said . Mr Muchena said after consultations , the committee will come up with a proposal that will be sent to the minister to craft the relevant statutory instrument . He said under the envisaged system only serious traffic offences and not all transgressions will warrant docking of points .
“ The minister has tasked the Traffic Safety Council of Zimbabwe to lead the process of coming up with content outlining which offences to include in penalties system . The system may not cover every offence . It 's an all stakeholders committee that has been set led by TSCZ to conduct consultations and come up with a proposal that will be presented to the minister and crafted into the Statutory Instrument which will effect the penalty system , ” he said .
Mr Muchena said the new system is expected to complement existing measures in deterring drivers from habitually contravening road traffic laws . He was however , non-committal on when the new law is expected to come into effect . On the minimum speed limits which come with the upgraded Highway Code , Mr Muchena said the provision was , in the same vain as the maximum speed limit , meant to help reduce road traffic accidents .
“ The upgraded Highway Code also has minimum speed signs . We were used to regulatory signs but we now have prohibitive and command signs . The minimum speed sign is white with a blue background and tells the driver to travel for example at 50 km/hr or above . If you are caught driving bellow 50km/hr that will be an offence , ” he said . Added Mr Muchena , “ You will not find that sort of sign in Bulawayo urban but maybe on the road from Bulawayo to Nkayi where there may be a continuous stretch . When you are traveling at 100km/hr on such a stretch then you come across someone driving at 30km/hr , such scenarios may contribute to accidents , especially when you are coming from behind . ”
He said some of the new signs in the upgraded Highway Code include the box junction which has already been introduced at some intersections in Harare 's Central Business District and will be introduced in Bulawayo soon .
“ The upgrade Highway Code has incorporated Sadc signs which are uniform in the region . There are new signs which are equivalent to the old signs and the onus is now on the driver to get a copy of the upgraded Highway Code and familiarise themselves with the new signs . The upgraded Highway Code has a chart that has both old signs and new signs which share the same meaning but are different . For example the new give way sign does not have the words give way but an inverted triangle or yield sign which means the same as give way , ” said Mr Muchena .

NEW YORK ( AP )  Facebook has revealed for the first time just what , exactly , is banned on its service in a new Community Standards document released on Tuesday . Its an updated version of the internal rules the company has used to determine whats allowed and what isnt , down to granular details such as what , exactly , counts as a credible threat of violence . The previous public-facing version gave a broad-strokes outline of the rules , but the specifics were shrouded in secrecy for most of Facebooks 2.2 billion users .
Not anymore . Here are just some examples of what the rules ban . Note : Facebook has not changed the actual rules  it has just made them public .
CREDIBLE VIOLENCE
Is there a real-world threat ? Facebook looks for credible statements of intent to commit violence against any person , groups of people , or place ( city or smaller ) . Is there a bounty or demand for payment ? The mention or an image of a specific weapon ? A target and at least two details such as location , method or timing ? A statement to commit violence against a vulnerable person or group such as heads-of-state , witnesses and confidential informants , activists , and journalists counts here too .
Also banned : instructions on on how to make or use weapons if the goal is to injure or kill people ,  unless there is clear context that the content is for an alternative purpose ( for example , shared as part of recreational self-defense activities , training by a countrys military , commercial video games , or news coverage ) .

HATE SPEECH
We define hate speech as a direct attack on people based on what we call protected characteristics  race , ethnicity , national origin , religious affiliation , sexual orientation , sex , gender , gender identity , and serious disability or disease . We also provide some protections for immigration status ,  Facebook says . As to what counts as a direct attack , the company says its any violent or dehumanizing speech , statements of inferiority , or calls for exclusion or segregation.
There are three tiers of severity , ranging from comparing a protected group to filth or disease to calls to exclude or segregate a person our group based on the protected characteristics . Facebook does note that it does allow criticism of immigration policies and arguments for restricting those policies.
GRAPHIC VIOLENCE
Images of violence against real people or animals with comments or captions that contain enjoyment of suffering , humiliation and remarks that speak positively of the violence or indicating the poster is sharing footage for sensational viewing pleasure are prohibited . The captions and context matter in this case because Facebook does allow such images in some cases where they are condemned , or shared as news or in a medical setting . Even then , though , the post must be limited so only adults can see them and Facebook adds a warning screen to the post .
CHILD SEXUAL EXPLOITATION
We do not allow content that sexually exploits or endangers children . When we become aware of apparent child exploitation , we report it to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children ( NCMEC ) , in compliance with applicable law . We know that sometimes people share nude images of their own children with good intentions ; however , we generally remove these images because of the potential for abuse by others and to help avoid the possibility of other people reusing or misappropriating the images ,  Facebook says . Then , it lists at least 12 specific instances of children in a sexual context , saying the ban includes , but is not limited to these examples . This includes uncovered female nipples for children older than toddler-age.
ADULT NUDITY AND SEXUAL ACTIVITY
We understand that nudity can be shared for a variety of reasons , including as a form of protest , to raise awareness about a cause , or for educational or medical reasons . Where such intent is clear , we make allowances for the content . For example , while we restrict some images of female breasts that include the nipple , we allow other images , including those depicting acts of protest , women actively engaged in breast-feeding , and photos of post-mastectomy scarring ,  Facebook says . That said , the company says it defaults to removing sexual imagery to prevent the sharing of non-consensual or underage content . The restrictions apply to images of real people as well as digitally created content , although art  such as drawings , paintings or sculptures  is an exception .
Billy Bragg has been releasing one-off political tracks all year long , and today he 's put out a new one called “ Saffiyah Smiles ” that was inspired by a viral photo of Saffiyah Khan smiling while protesting an anti-immigrant demonstration in Birmingham last spring . Bragg provided some more context to NPR :
Following the shocking scenes of white supremacists marching through the streets of Charlottesville this past summer , my mind went back to an image of a young woman facing down a ranting fascist with nothing but a serene smile . Saffiyah Khan had been taking part in a counter demonstration against the neo-fascist English Defence League in Birmingham , England , in April this year when she saw a woman being surrounded by taunting EDL supporters .
Saria Zafar was targeted because she was wearing a hijab and when the police failed to intervene , Saffiyah stepped up and got in the face of the loudest aggressor , holding him at bay with nothing more than a smile until police eventually intervened . A press photographer ( Joe Giddens ) captured the moment and the picture went viral . Local Labour MP Jess Phillips memorably tweeted the image with the caption , ‘ Who looks like they have the power here ? '

Who will win the Men 's Money in the Bank Ladder Match ?
This week 's episode of WWE SmackDown was important in knowing the participants of the Men 's Money in the Bank ladder match . Initially , the match was scheduled between Big Cass and Samoa Joe . However , Big Cass would interrupt the proceedings and declare that he had been medically cleared to compete .
General Manager Paige would intervene later and make the main-event a triple threat match with the winner advancing to the Men 's Money in the Bank ladder match . Samoa Joe would eventually win the match and complete the jigsaw puzzle .
The Samoan Submission Machine is not the only big name to head into the Men 's Money in the Bank ladder match as a favorite . Other heavyweights like Kevin Owens and Braun Strowman ( and probably Big E ) will try to make sure that he falls short .
So , who is the actual favorite to win the Men 's Money in the Bank ladder match ? Here are our predictions for the Men 's Money in the Bank ladder match .

Braun Strowman does n't require the Money in the Bank contract to dethrone Brock Lesnar
Do n't mistake us . Braun Strowman is a future World Champion in our eyes . However , he does n't require the Money in the Bank contract for that .
The 'Monster among Men ' has skyrocketed his status as a main-event superstar since WrestleMania 33 . If you look at his accolades , he has won almost everything since then . Survivor Series survivor ? Check . Burying the Raw tag team division at WrestleMania ? Check . The Greatest Royal Rumble ? Check .
He has won almost every big thing in the WWE . The Money in the Bank contract is n't a necessity for him currently . If the WWE wants him to take out Brock Lesnar , he can do that without it .
According to media reports , a senior US General has assured Islamabad that the United States is not planning to conduct military operations inside Pakistan . Another General said that despite differences Pakistan remains “ absolutely critical ” to America 's success in Afghanistan , while the Pentagon 's chief spokesperson urged Islamabad to join US efforts to defeat terrorists in the South Asian region . Comments by US Joint Staff Director Lt Gen Kenneth McKenzie at a Pentagon news briefing came after a White House statement on Tuesday said that the US military had been given authority to eliminate militant safe havens in both Pakistan and Afghanistan .
The US Joint Staff Director made things pretty clear by explaining that their strategy is inherently regional and Pakistan is geographically located at a critical nexus of a lot of different things — Pakistan is a fundamental part of the strategy . This is an indication that instead of antagonizing Pakistan , as became evident from public statements emanating from the US Capital starting from the { in- } famous tweet of President Donald Trump , the United States wants to depend on a regional strategy and solution . This has long been emphasized by Pakistan but its words and counselling was never taken seriously by policy-makers in the US . But when it comes to the regional strategy or approach , here again the United States is conveying an impression that it is banking more on India , which has nothing common with Afghanistan as against Pakistan that has shared history with its Western neighbour and their fate is also linked to each other . It is because of this that Pakistan can not afford to have perennial trouble across Durand Line with serious implications for socio-economic development of Pakistan . Latest statements from Pentagon indicate that sanity has started prevailing in the United States and this can lead to resumption of genuine and sincere cooperation between the two countries in the fight against terror and also for seeking peaceful solution of the long-drawn conflict in Afghanistan . However , for this to happen , the Afghan Government too will have to change its attitude towards Pakistan as some of its arms are advancing Indian agenda with the help of RAW that is aimed at destabilizing Pakistan . Blaming Pakistan for every wrong in Afghanistan amounts to closing your eyes to ground realities with Daesh establishing its foothold right in the vicinity of Kabul and Taliban gaining control of over sixty percent of the Afghan territory . Why Taliban need to operate from Pakistan when they have sizeable chunks under their control in Afghanistan ?

The drug war gets a lot more out of control in Sony 's new trailer for “ Sicario : Day of the Soldado ” with Benicio Del Toro returning as undercover operative Alejandro Gillick and Josh Brolin back as CIA agent Matt Graver
Early in the bleak trailer , Del Toro 's character — whose family was murdered by a cartel kingpin — guns down a cartel operative in broad daylight on a street after pulling off his mask and saying “ Adios ” to the victim .
The pair , who starred with Emily Blunt in 2015 's “ Sicario , ” finds themselves back in the middle of the violent war against drugs along the United States-Mexico border . With the drug cartels now smuggling terrorists across the U.S. border , they decide to pit the cartels against each other .
“ You want to see this thing through ? I 'm going to have to get … . dirty , ” Brolin tells a roomful of government officials .
Brolin 's character tells Del Toro 's that he 's going to start a war . Asked “ Against whom , ” he replies , “ Everyone . No rules this time . ”
The trailer includes choppers swooping through the desert , plenty of gunfire , and multiple vehicle explosions , including one that appears to be from a guided missile . At one point , Brolin tells a colleague on a phone call , eliciting the response “ Luck does n't live on this side of the border . ”
The cast includes Matthew Modine , Catherine Keener , Manuel Garcia-Rulfo , and Jeffrey Donovan . Blunt and director Denis Villeneuve opted not to return .
Italian filmmaker Stefano Sollima helms the movie , written again by Taylor Sheridan .
“ Sicario ” was released by Lionsgate and grossed $ 84.9 million worldwide . Lionsgate and production company Black Label Media agreed in April to have Sony Pictures release the sequel domestically , with Lionsgate retaining the international rights .
“ Sicario : Day of the Soldado ” opens on June 29 .
As Pakistan 's highest powered delegation returned from a surprise visit to Saudi Arabia questions still abound , including the most basic ones – what was the purpose of the trip and what was achieved , if anything was achieved at all ? These questions are all the more important given the context ; in the middle of full blown diplomatic crisis in the Gulf where the vast majority of public opinion is urging neutrality and conciliation .
Pakistan 's Prime Minister , Chief of Army Staff , and Finance Minister visited the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia for reasons unknown .
These reasons must be explained , and the National Assembly 's demand for the Prime Minister to brief the house on the trip is a reasonable one that must be met .
While the executive usually handles diplomatic outreach on its own , it is justified for the National Assembly to demand oversight in this case .
Pakistan 's relationship with Saudi Arabia has always involved an element of military cooperation , and Pakistan has been forced to unwillingly adopt the kingdom 's stance in the Middle East on many occasions .
The compulsion backed by economic support has caused problems in the past and continue to do so ; Pakistan was included in the coalition against Yemen without its consent and only the intervention of the parliament kept it out of an unnecessary and deadly war .
Similarly Pakistan had little say when the Saudi led “ anti-terrorism coalition ” morphed into an anti-Iran league .
Considering the increasing polarization around the Qatar crisis , it is to be expected that Saudi Arabia will try to include Pakistan in its embargo of the Gulf state .
With both the military and Nawaz Sharif beholden to the Saudis , the job of checking partiality falls to the parliament ; a role that it has performed admirably in the past .
The Prime Minister needs to provide a clear and frank account of the conversations with the Saudi King and provide details on the stance adopted by the kingdom .
There is a discrepancy between the statements coming from both parties that are troubling ; Nawaz Sharif talks of “ Umah solidarity ” while the Saudis of “ combating terrorism ” .
Both are on the opposite end of the spectrum considering the context .
The opposition has even guaranteed that there will be no politicking or sloganeering during Prime Minister 's briefing - a worthy move that underlines the seriousness of the situation .
It is time the government does the same and takes the Parliament on board .

Jurgen Klopp has put to bed claims Sadio Mane is jealous of Mohamed Salah , telling the press : `` They are best friends '' .
The claim first emerged that the duo had fallen out after Mane failed to set Salah up to score with an easy tap-in during the Merseyside derby in Decemeber .
Arsenal legend Ian Wright discussed the issue on BBC Radio 5 Live at the time , where he suggested Mane may be jealous of his team-mate .
Wright said : `` Do you think there is a bit of jealous there ? With Mo Salah ? He just looks a little bit perturbed by it , '' resulting in the issue being discussed in the press .
( Image : Getty Images Europe )
But Klopp , while talking about Mane 's recent dip in form on Friday , dispelled the rumors once and for all .
`` I do n't think too much about it [ Mane 's form ] , even if Sadio is not at his best he 's still a threat for other teams , '' he said . `` He had the two biggest chances in Huddersfield , he did n't score - no problem . When you win 3-0 it is no problem .
`` You need to carry on , keep on going , for him it is exactly the same . I realise there are good moments , fantastic moments , average moments for players , but you ca n't change immediately .
( Image : AFP )
`` Build on good things , work on not so good things . On an average day he is still a fantastic player . For sure , the new situation he is in with Mo Salah .
`` They are best friends , he 's not jealous , but everyone watches now there to see what he [ Salah ] is doing .
( Image : Action Images via Reuters )
`` And adapting to all these situations , that 's how a team grows together . That 's what 's happening at the moment .
`` We have the points we have so far with Sadio in the shape he was in the season so far , we know he can play better , let 's work on it . ''
Usain Bolt has warned the next generation of Jamaican sprinters they have to display the same insatiable desire for greatness he did if they are to follow in his footsteps .
Bolt bade a final farewell to the sport he has ruled for the past nine years with an emotional lap of honour at the end of the World Championships in London on Sunday .
Warmth poured down from the packed stands , but he admitted he had endured a `` rough '' send-off on the track , having to settle for bronze in the 100 metres and then pulling up injured in his very last race , the 4x100m relay .
Jamaica finished the 10 days of competition with just one gold medal , courtesy of Omar McLeod in the 110m hurdles .
In the men 's and women 's 100m , 200m and 4x100m relays they won just two bronze medals in total , the women 's sprint quartet claiming the other place on the podium . There was no Jamaican representation at all in the final of either the men 's or women 's 200m .
At the Rio Olympics last year those six sprint events produced five golds and one silver .
Bolt denied it was a sign Jamaican sprinting was on the wane , but accepted his were big shoes to fill .
`` It 's just one of those things , sometimes it just does n't go your way , '' he said . `` There is lots of talent in Jamaica , I 've seen it myself , I 've seen the youngsters .
`` But I 've learned that everybody is not like me -- you have to want it , you have to be hungry , you have to want to be the greatest and I think that will be the key thing for the Jamaican athletes . Do they want to be the best , do they want to be the greatest ?
`` If they want to be great they can . If they work hard and put the effort in , athletics for Jamaica will be safe . ''

That will to win is personified in the race singled out by Bolt as the most impressive of his career -- not one of his Olympic gold medals from Beijing , London or Rio , nor his world record runs of 9.58 seconds for the 100m and 19.19secs for the 200m , but his 100m victory over Justin Gatlin , by just one-hundredth of a second , at the 2015 World Championships .
`` I had to really fight to win , I think it showed a lot of character , '' he added .
The 19-time global champion believes the legacy he will leave the sport is the knowledge that `` anything is possible '' , a sentiment he acknowledged he proved with his struggles in London .
`` It 's ironic that my motto says anything is possible and no one would ever have felt like I would be beaten in a championship , '' Bolt said .
`` I 'm on the wrong end of this situation , but I personally feel this is a good message for kids -- work hard , be strong and push on . ''
Walking away he may be , but Bolt is eager to remain in the sport . Certainly , losing him completely is not something it can contemplate .
`` My agent is talking to Mr Coe [ the president of athletics ' world governing body the IAAF ] to figure out in what way I can help the sport and I am looking forward to this , '' he said .
For the time being , though , Bolt 's focus is on enjoying his freedom , unconstrained at last by the rigours of training and competition .
`` My whole life has been pretty much track and field , '' he said . `` I 've been doing this pretty much since I was 10 , so all I know is track . For me to be able to relax and have fun and just live a little bit is exciting . ''
Iran Focus
London , 15 Feb - A member of the Iranian Resistance has bravely spoken out about the assassination attempt on his life by the Iranian Regime , and why now is the time to eliminate the Iranian Regime .
Hossein Abedini , a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the National Council of Resistance of Iran ( NCRI ) , wrote an op-ed for Forbes on the challenges that the world faces from Iran and specifically , those faced by America .
He noted that the Iranian Regime is “ fundamentally violent and adversarial ” and that must factor into policy regarding Iran .
Defense Secretary James Mattis recently stated that Iran was the number one state sponsor of terrorism in the world , and Abedini commended his statement , writing further that the Regime uses its Revolutionary Guards ( IRGC ) to commit terrorist acts and spread terrorist ideologies .
In fact , Abedini is living proof that the Iranian Regime 's bloodthirsty activities extend well beyond their borders , as 27 years ago they tried to kill him in Turkey .
He wrote : “ In mid-afternoon on March 14 , 1990 , I was sitting next to the driver taking me to the Istanbul airport . As we were discussing the state of affairs in Iran , a car suddenly blocked our path . A few seconds later another car pinned us in from behind . ”
He continued : “ In a flash , two strange men from the front car jumped out with automatic weapons . I made a decision in a split second . I opened the car door and rushed at them carrying only a small briefcase . One of the men fired nine bullets ; the other man 's gun jammed . I was gravely wounded . The assailants fled . My four-month struggle for survival had just started . ”
He was rushed to the hospital where he remained unconscious for three months , undergoing 14 surgeries , receiving 154 pints of blood , and losing 80 % of his liver . At one point during his treatment , his odds of recovery was 1 % .
A few days after Abedini 's initial attack , Mohammad Mohaddessin , the chairman of the foreign affairs committee of the National Council of Resistance of Iran , was assassinated in Turkey by the Iranian Regime .
This was not the end of Abedini 's troubles , though ; the Regime tried to kill him several more times whilst he was recovering in hospital but thankfully did not succeed .
This was not the case with so many of Iran 's other victims . Indeed , two years prior to the assassination attempt of Abedini , the Regime attempted to destroy the Resistance Forces in the 1988 Iranian massacre .
Abedini wrote : “ Make no mistake , the current Iranian government has in no way moderated its behaviour , contrary to the promises of the Obama administration . Terrorism is a pillar of the survival of the turbaned tyrants in Iran . Hassan Rouhani , the current president , was the secretary of the Supreme National Security Council for many years and is now its president . It was the organisation that ordered major terrorist activities of the regime , including the attempt on my life , and its function remains the same to this day . ”
He encouraged the Trump administration to see through the moderate façade , list the IRGC as a foreign terrorist group , and “ cripple the Iranian regime 's terror machine for the betterment of the Iranians , the region and the world ” .
Last year , Google launched Instant Apps , a way for developers to give users a native app experience that did n't involve having to install anything . Users would simply click on a link on the search results page and the instant app would load . Today , the company is extending this program to games . Thanks to this , you can now see what playing a level or two of Clash Royale , Final Fantasy XV : A New Empire or Panda Pop is like without having to go through the usual install procedure . Instead , you simply head for the Google Play Store , find a game that supports this feature , and hit the “ Try now ” button .
Google Play product managers Jonathan Karmel and Benjamin Frenkel told me that the team learned a lot from the experience with building Instant Apps . For games , though , the team decided to increase the maximum file size from 2 MB to 10 MB , which is n't really a surprise , given that a game needs a few more graphical assets than your regular to-do list app . In my experience testing this feature , this still allows the games to load quickly enough , though it does n't feel quite as instant as most of the regular instant apps do .
The main idea behind this project , Karmel and Frenkel said , is to drive discovery . To do this , the team is adding a new ‘ arcade ' tab in the newly redesigned Google Play Games app to highlight the current crop of Instant games and launching an Instant Gameplay collection in the Google Play Store . The main advantage of these Instant games , though , is that users can try the game without having to install anything . As the team noted , every extra step in the installation process offers potential players yet another chance to drop off and move on . Indeed , many users actually install a game and then never open it .
Some casual games already take up less than 10 MB and those developers will be able to opt to make their complete game available as a Play Instant app , too .
For now , this project is still a closed beta , though Google plans to open it up to more developers later this year . Some games that currently support Play Instant include Clash Royale , Words with Friends 2 , Bubble Witch 3 Saga and Panda Pop , as well as a few other titles from Playtika , Jam City , MZ , and Hothead .
As Karmel and Frenkel told me , their teams are still working on providing developers with better tooling for building these apps and Google is also working with the likes of Unity and the Cocos2D-x teams to make building instant apps easier . For the most part , though , building an Instant Play game means bringing the file size to under 10 MB and adding a few lines to the app 's manifest . That 's probably easier said than done , though , given that you still want players to have an interesting experience .
Unsurprisingly , some developers currently make better use of that limited file size than others . When you try Final Fantasy XV : A New Empire , all you can do is regularly tap on some kind of blue monster and get some gold until the game informs you how much gold you received . That 's it . Over time , though , I 'm sure developers will figure out how to best use this feature .

With only one episode left for “ The Americans , ” there are still a couple of key questions lingering — namely how Philip and Elizabeth Jennings ( Matthew Rhys and Keri Russell ) could be good at covering their spy tracks day-to-day but overlook the importance of loading dummy information into a government system .
After all , when FBI agent Stan Beeman ( Noah Emmerich ) hoped he 'd lay his suspicions about his best friends and neighbors to rest and typed their names into his FBI database , what he found not only cause him anxiety but also caused the audience the same .
Is the jig finally up for FX 's favorite covert Russian ops ?
Ahead of the series finale , Emmerich talks with Variety about his character 's role in the Jenningses ' predicament , weighs in on the Russian who is currently in Stan 's clutches ( Costa Ronin 's Oleg ) and reflects on some other characters in the Jennings-Beeman orbit who may not have faired so well over the years .
Stan 's had a hunch about the Jenningses since the pilot when he broke into their garage late at night after a Soviet defector goes missing and a car like theirs was spotted near the crime scene . Why do you think he dropped it for so long ?
Related Noah Emmerich Joins Sacha Baron Cohen in Netflix Drama 'The Spy ' TV Review : The Final Season of 'The Americans ' on FX
Part of it is that it seems too obvious and possible : How could his neighbors next door be these people ? It would make so little sense . Even though his Spidey-sense was tingling enough to break and enter their garage and search their car at the end of the pilot , that came up nothing and he thought , “ I must be crazy. ” The odds of it being the people across the street are a billion to one and they seem like a nice family and their kids are great and there 's nothing else suspicious about them whatsoever . …Although , like in life , once that seed has been planted , even if you bury it — it continues to grow somewhat depending on how much water and sunlight it gets . So I think there were some little things percolating along the way that may have stimulated that sense but not enough to convert into action until we find him doing so . I wondered how they were going to write out of that . It so alarmed me because OK , we 're at the end of hour one of hopefully a long show . What are you going to do with this character who 's become suspicious ? Either he 's going to become inanely incompetent or he 's going to have to die really soon or the show 's going to end really soon — none of which sounded like good options . I think they did a terrifically elegant job of navigating that in a believable way [ throughout the series ] .
You have said that you did not want to know what happened to Stan until you got the scripts . Why was that ?
It does sort of flavor and inform your sense of the character and your sense of the story . Knowing the future is a weird thing . I think if we knew the future , we 'd have miserable lives . In a weird way for an actor , it depends on the medium . In a film , if you 're doing an hour-and-a-half or two-hour story , you need to know the arch of your character because it 's important for the shape of the performance from the beginning to the end . In a show like this , which runs for six years , it 's impossible to do that . It 's not actually set in stone ; it 's a living , breathing entity that changes with time . It surprised me because I generally like to know everything . I came into this show saying tell me everything . Over the course of a season or two , I said it 's actually better for me not to know and it 'll make my job easier to be in the moment that Stan 's in and not know where he 's going .
Lots of fans say “ how could Stan not see this ” ? But how much of this is because he needed a friend ? He 's a workaholic who got divorced during this show . Maybe he needed Philip .
I take issue with how could Stan not see this . How could Stan not see what ? The audience is watching everything from behind closed doors . They 're watching the Jenningses at home and in their basement and in their car doing all these things . All Stan sees is a neighbor across the street inviting him over for a beer . The only thing he can point to is that they left at odd hours . But so did Stan . I do n't know how many times Stan just happened to be looking out the window and saw Philip and Elizabeth leave at midnight or one in the morning . I totally understand that you 're watching it on TV and [ going ] “ Wait a minute ! They 're right next door and they 're arguing about Mother Russia ! ” [ But ] they have two normal American children and they live a normal American life . They share Thanksgiving and family holidays and the occasional beer and some racquetball — I just do n't know what there was for Stan to see .
Stan does n't look up their names or travel agency that they supposedly run in the agency 's database until the penultimate episode .
Right . Well , nowadays it would be much more different story because there is Google . But why would Stan look up his neighbor 's name unless he really , really suspected ? But I think that 's also what we gain from that pilot episode : It was almost embarrassing for Stan to suspect that it would have been that easy .
Part of this is that Stan has no idea how close he 's been on the Jenningses ' trail this entire time . Among the overlaps , Philip flipped FBI secretary Martha [ Alison Wright ] after a long con and shipped her off to Russia . He also killed Stan 's partner , Chris Amador [ Maximiliano Hernández ] . Which of these two incidents do you think would upset Stan more ?
Oh , they 're both devastatingly upsetting . I guess Chris is final and there 's no redemption from that . Killing someone is the worst it can be . Martha , at least , is alive unbeknownst to Stan .
To Philip 's credit , he and Chris got in a scuffle when they both were outside Martha 's apartment . It was n't premeditated .
This is because we love these characters and they 're portrayed so beautifully by such amazing actors , but the reality is that they 're cold-blooded killers that have decimated a large percentage of the American population in the name of [ Mother Russia ] . I 'm happy that you 're defending Philip , who has murdered a perfectly innocent FBI agent who has given his life to protecting the country . It speaks well to the writers and to Matthew Rhys ' performance that you 're defending the murder of Amador .
How does that feel to you that I 'm doing this ? In all normal scenarios , Stan is the hero .
I think that 's the beauty of the show . It 's not about good guys versus bad guys , it 's about people . In the real world , every bad guy has a mother and a father and potentially children . There 's no such thing as a bad guy from one [ person 's ] point of view . People do bad things , but what makes us good or bad ? Where humanity ends is a territory this show has explored . We all have those capabilities . I do n't mean to be naïve , but it forces us to look at the show with a greater complexity and understanding .
Is that also why you think Stan did n't bug the house when he broke in a few weeks ago in the episode “ Harvest ” ?
I do n't think it was a planned break in . That might have been his next move . I think it was a spontaneous decision in that moment . It was n't a Watergate moment . But bugging the house is a great idea for episode 11 . Editor 's note : This final season only has 10 episodes .
Stan 's also now arrested Oleg , who is asking for help with one important piece of information . They still are n't sure if they can trust one another and the last time a Russian asked Stan to commit treason it did n't go so well for that Russian .
I think Stan did everything he could to protect Nina [ the aforementioned Russian played by Annet Mahendru , who had a fateful ending in season 4 ] and [ now ] to protect Oleg . With Oleg , he went so far as to jeopardize his career by refusing to cooperate and insisting that they take certain actions to protect Oleg . It was part of his journey away from counter-intelligence and away from the spy game . [ Stan decided ] that the cost of humanity and the fruits of labor did not justify the means , which is why we find him at the beginning of this year having left counter-intelligence and now working in the criminal justice department of the FBI .
In terms of Oleg , he 's grown to respect Oleg as a human being and a person and as a man who places the world 's health above his political agenda — as he does when he shares with Stan some piece of information at the end of season 4 that is traitorous for Oleg . I think they respect each other and have an understanding of each other .
Did you keep any souvenirs from the show ?
You know , I did not . There was no particular object that had continuous resonance for me . I kept my chair back , which I always keep from all my work . I left the rest to memory .
Your next project is a Netflix project that is quite literally called “ The Spy. ” It 's from Gideon Raff , the guy who created “ Prisoners of War , ” the Israeli show that inspired the Showtime spy drama “ Homeland. ” Are you worried about getting typecast ?
No . Not really . It 's another spy show , that 's for sure , but the characters are very different and have nothing to do with Stan . It might be a genre that I get stuck in , but this will be it . I really was n't planning on doing a spy genre at all , but this came along and it 's a great piece .

OTL describes how Oakland 's Mark Davis -- with a little luck , his own brand of genius and an assist from Jerry Jones -- outflanked power brokers to put the Raiders in Las Vegas . ( 3:07 )
ALAMEDA , Calif. -- While the Oakland Raiders may be lame ducks as they await a move to Las Vegas , quarterback Derek Carr hopes fans wo n't be , well , lame in the interim .
In fact , he expects fans to unite , rather than fight with each other .
`` We 're not going to split up like you 've seen other cities do , '' Carr said Monday , and immediately images of Cleveland and Houston in the mid-1990s , when the Browns and Oilers departed for Baltimore and Tennessee , respectively , come to mind .
`` We 're not going to do things like that . For the ones that do , I do n't really believe that they 're true Raider fans . I feel their hurt . I 'm with you . I hurt , too . But at the same time , we 're all in this together and we 're just going to do it together . ''
The Raiders won the right to relocate to Southern Nevada on March 27 by a 31-1 vote .
Raiders owner Mark Davis does not plan on moving to Las Vegas until a $ 1.9 billion , 65,000-seat domed stadium with natural grass opens in 2020 . The Raiders will play in Oakland this coming season and have a lease option for 2018 at the Oakland Coliseum but thus far have no concrete plan for the 2019 season .
`` I feel their hurt . I 'm with you . I hurt , too , '' Derek Carr said of the Raiders move away from Oakland . `` But at the same time , we 're all in this together and we 're just going to do it together . '' Jake Roth-USA TODAY Sports
And while the future may be a bit muddy , Raiders players insisted on the first day of the team 's offseason workout program it will not detract from their on-field goals .
`` We 're just trying to focus on right now , '' said Pro Bowl center Rodney Hudson . `` Like you said , we 'll be playing in Oakland this year . We 're just trying to focus on what we can do every day to get better and worry about the rest whenever that time comes . ''
Defensive player of the year Khalil Mack said it `` feels weird now '' knowing a move is coming .
`` But I feel once we get in that stadium and get around the fans and them knowing that the players do n't have control over those things , it comes down to us coming to work and doing our job and doing whatever it takes to win , '' he said .
`` That 's the easy part . It 's just outside noise . That 's the stuff you deal with throughout the year , all year . You deal with different teams , different players saying different things about your team . It 's ultimate focus for us to lock in on what we have to do right now . It 's just day by day , going to work with each other and doing what it takes to win ball games . That 's our only focus . ''
Even with the regular season still four-plus months away , and a potential awkward vibe in the Coliseum . Still , Carr does not anticipate the Black Hole having a different feel .
`` Out of like 1,000 people , you 're going to get one or two that have something to say and that 's with everything , '' he said .
`` Hopefully y'all do n't focus on that kind of stuff because there 's the 99 percent that are loyal , faithful fans that are going to ride with us wherever we 're at . ''
Carr said neither his teammates nor his coaches would be affected by the lame duck status . Even if , he acknowledges , Oakland fans are still hurting .
After all , the Raiders are coming off a 12-4 season , their first playoff appearance since 2002 and are a team on the rise ... just as they are set to depart .
`` The people that it affects the most are our fans here that we have , '' Carr said . `` I think that that 's the hardest part . But at the same time , we still have some good years ahead of us here . I think that our fans are really excited about that . I think that they realize that , that we still have some times that we can really enjoy here . I think that is the main focus right now .
`` We have to do those things to make sure we continue to have success . I think our fans will realize as the season gets closer that we 're here and focused on the now . ''
And for those Las Vegas fans awaiting the Raiders ' arrival ?
`` Yeah , they should be really excited , '' Carr said . `` We have a good football team that works really hard , of great character . When we go there , it 's not so much us incorporating into Vegas , it 's the Las Vegas people incorporating into the Raiders . We 're not going to change who we are . We 're coming into this city , we 're bringing our brand , we 're bringing the Silver and Black and hopefully they just come and be a part of it . That 's what we want . We want them to be a part of it now .
`` But again , our focus is here in Oakland right now . ''
Even if they will be sharing a stadium with a college rival of the Fresno State-bred Carr .
`` I ca n't root for UNLV when we get there , so please do n't be offended , '' Carr said with a laugh . `` I love you guys , but it 's still Fresno State all of the way .
`` I think ( the Las Vegas Raiders is ) going to be another show , you know ? And I think that , hopefully , it 'll turn into the hottest one . ''
“ We 've been frustrated , ” said Katie Fahey . “ By the time of the meeting , it will have been 48 or 49 days since we turned in language . We 've lost an entire month of the summer , but thankfully Michigan has a lot of fall activities happening too . We have a lot of volunteers set and ready to get going. ” ( Photo : Detroit News file )
Lansing – A Michigan petition aimed at preventing political gerrymandering will go before the Board of State Canvassers on Thursday , when potential approval could end a delay that cost organizers more than a month of prime summer signature-gathering time .
The “ Voters Not Politicians ” petition proposes creating an independent citizen redistricting commission to redraw legislative and congressional boundaries every 10 years , a task currently controlled by the Michigan Legislature .
Organizers submitted language on June 28 , prompting Bureau of Elections staff to review what critics are calling an overly complicated proposal to amend the Michigan Constitution . The small-print proposal spans seven pages and would alter or repeal several sections of the state 's primary governing document .
The group made a series of modifications during the review process , including one change Monday morning , spokesman Katie Fahey said later the same day . If the petition is approved as to form , volunteers could begin circulating petitions later this week .
“ We 've been frustrated , ” Fahey said . “ By the time of the meeting , it will have been 48 or 49 days since we turned in language . We 've lost an entire month of the summer , but thankfully Michigan has a lot of fall activities happening too . We have a lot of volunteers set and ready to get going . ”
While canvassers will ultimately vote on the matter , the Bureau of Elections “ will recommend approval ” of the redistricting petition so long as it “ contains the edits that were suggested , ” Secretary of State spokesman Fred Woodhams said Monday after the group submitted a printer 's affidavit and final draft .
Organizers are seeking pre-approval of the petition as to form , an optional step many groups take in order to avoid potential legal challenges . Lt. Gov . Brian Calley 's “ Clean MI ” committee last month began circulating revised part-time Legislature petitions without approval from the board , which had raised questions over an earlier version .
Fahey acknowledged the redistricting plan is “ complicated ” but called it a “ thorough ” approach to stopping “ unaccountable politicians ” from manipulating political lines to benefit their own party 's candidates .
“ We 're creating a new commission and helping take power away from the legislators and governor , ” she said . “ It 's just really detailed so there ca n't be any trickery happening . ”
Critics argue the petition for a potential 2018 ballot proposal is rife with “ sloppy craftsmanship ” and could have unforeseen consequences .
“ They 've adopted all these buzzwords , but how they work together , frankly , is mystifying to me , ” said Bob Labrant , a Republican attorney who has played a key role in Michigan redistricting efforts since the 1980s .
The proposal would create a 13-member commission that includes four residents who self-identify as Democrats , four who self-identify as Republicans and five others who are “ nonaffiliated ” and independent , according to the proposed petition language .
Every 10 years , the Michigan Secretary of State 's office would randomly select commissioners from a pool of registered voters who submitted a publicly available application and were not disqualified by Republican or Democratic leaders in the House and Senate .
The proposal calls for a cooling-off period for partisan political candidates , elected officials , precinct delegates , lobbyists , consultants or political staffers who could not serve on the commission within six years of holding those jobs . The prohibitions would extend to parents , children or spouses of those individuals .
The commission would be required to hold at least 10 public hearings throughout the state before drafting any redistricting plan . It would be required to publish proposed redistricting plans , along with relevant data and supporting materials , and hold at least five more public hearings on each .
“ This is frankly a community organizer 's dream , ” said LaBrant , general counsel at The Sterling Corporation in Lansing . “ If you can turn out bodies and they can all read from the same three-by-five- index card , and you 've got people on the commission without any partisan leanings , whoever gets to pack the hearing has got a leg up on determining how these districts are drawn . ”
The commission would have to “ abide ” by certain criteria in crafting districts of equal population , that are geographically contiguous , that reflect Michigan 's diversity and “ communities of interest , ” that reflect consideration of community boundaries and that are reasonably compact .
Critically , the districts must “ not provide a disproportionate advantage to any political party , ” as determined using “ accepted measures of partisan fairness ” — which do not appear to be spelled out in the petition .
Michigan 's state House and congressional districts redrawn by Republicans after the 2010 census resulted in one of the most lopsided political advantages in the country last year , according to an Associated Press analysis .
The AP study was based on a new measurement called the “ efficiency gap , ” which has been criticized by some experts but informed a lawsuit challenging Wisconsin 's state House boundaries that is now before the U.S. Supreme Court .
Under the Michigan proposal , final congressional and legislative maps would require majority approval by the commission , with support from at least two members of each major political party and two independents . If that does n't happen , commissioners would submit plans , individually rank them and then enact the highest-ranking plan .
Voters Not Politicians said it held more than three dozen public meetings as it developed the petition language . The group would need to collect more than 315,000 signatures in 180 days to put its proposed amendment to the state constitution on the ballot in 2018 .
The committee plans to launch its signature gathering operation without paid circulators . More than 7,000 volunteers have signed up to help , according to Fahey , and almost 4,000 of those have been assigned to ground teams .
“ We 've gotten some petitions printed , so we 're hoping we could actually start Thursday , depending on approval , ” Fahey said .
Canvassers on Thursday are also expected to consider the form of a statewide petition seeking to require that Michigan employers provide workers with sick leave under certain conditions . Attempts to reach organizers were unsuccessful . A committee phone number went to the voicemail for an activist group called Mothering Justice .
A third petition up for review Thursday was submitted by a pro-marijuana group called Abrogate Prohibition Michigan , but the final language had not yet been submitted to the state by Monday afternoon . Another marijuana legalization petition is already in the field .

As the NHL heads into its first weekend of regular season action for the 2017-18 season , there a few pieces of news and some speculation that one team might be making a major change .
The Senators have an issue with Kyle Turris and the Flames could have a slight issue with Jaromir Jagr . The Golden Knights are back at the top of the pile in terms of making moves and Iginla is still waiting .
Ottawa Senators and Kyle Turris
Word was released by TSN Hockey Insider Darren Dreger that the Ottawa Senators and forward Kyle Turris might be at an impasse in terms of his future with the organization . The Senators have been unwilling to meet Turris ‘ ask for a long-term extension and he believes this means a trade is the only likely outcome .
Both sides started talking extension this summer but the Sens do n't believe he 's the right fit for their team into his later years . Dreger said :
“ There has been a fair bit of dialogue between Senators management and the agent who represents Kyle Turris , dating back to early July or late June . Kyle Turris wants to commit long-term to the Ottawa Senators , we 're talking about a seven or eight-year term . So far , the Sens have n't been willing to do that , so they can not allow an important piece like Kyle Turris to walk out as an unrestricted free agent .
This is a big blow to the organization should they lose Turris . He 's the team 's top center and scored 27 goals and 55 points in 78 games with the Senators last season . He was also a major factor in the playoffs and there 's no way the Sens get back as valuable a piece back if teams know they two sides are n't seeing eye to eye .
Would a trade with the Avalanche for Matt Duchene be an option worth considering ? A center for a center with two valuable pieces might get the conversation started from both sides .
Jagr Not Ready
Jaromir Jagr joined the Calgary Flames in time to see his new team lose to the Edmonton Oilers on Wednesday , and while he was n't ready to play , it appears it might be longer than some expected before he does more than skate with the team in practice .

Word is that Jagr is not feeling well after full practices with the franchise and it could be some time before he feels like he 's in game shape and ready to go as part of the current roster . Jagr has no intention to step on the ice until he feels he can compete and Flames ' coach Glen Gulutzan said Jagr will let him know and outside of that , the team will wait .
Jagr could be ready as early as Saturday and it could be much longer .
Golden Knights Will Be Busy
We 've already seen one trade as the Golden Knights sent goaltender Calvin Pickard to the Maple Leafs for forward Tobias Lindberg and a 2018 sixth-round pick . The team has also sent a number of players to the minors because their contracts allowed them to do so and the team might have more pending moves coming .
TSN 's Bob McKenzie suggests this could be just the start of some major shuffling coming out of Vegas .
Jarome Iginla
There is no news at all regarding Jarome Iginla . He is still waiting for the right opportunity , but not a lot of opportunities appear to be presenting themselves . The longer this goes , the more Iginla might lean toward retirement .

Lansing — Conservative House committee members may have found an unlikely ally in their fight against a new tax incentive plan for companies that create new jobs : a liberal freshman Democrat from Dearborn .
While business groups praised an economic incentive package during a Wednesday House panel hearing , two Republicans and a Democrat expressed deep reservations with the plan . Their skepticism may mean the legislation does not have enough support to be approved out of committee .
GOP Reps. Steven Johnson of Wayland Township , Martin Howrylak of Troy and Democratic Rep. Abdullah Hammoud of Dearborn all oppose the package despite Gov . Rick Snyder 's recent trip to Japan to discuss a major pending trade deal that could hinge on the legislation . Snyder has pushed for the measure , although said it 's not a condition for his support for an ongoing plan to overhaul the teacher retirement system .
“ It 's communism , ” Johnson said , who is a pledged no vote along with Howrylak and Hammoud .
House Tax Policy Committee chairman Jim Tedder , R-Clarkston , said he has n't made up his mind on the plan but said he also has reservations and needs more time to consider it .
The panel took four hours of mostly supportive testimony from business groups but did not vote .
The hearing came as President Donald Trump suggested negotiations with an unidentified company during a visit to Milwaukee on Tuesday , according to the Associated Press , which confirmed with an anonymous source Wednesday that Foxconn is negotiating with Michigan and Wisconsin .
Wisconsin Gov . Scott Walker might get “ a very happy surprise very soon , ” Trump said Tuesday .
Bill backers say the proposed incentive plan could help woo Taiwanese electronics giant Foxconn to Michigan , which assembles the Apple iPhone in China and has a history of labor abuses there .
Foxconn is considering a $ 4.2 billion liquid-crystal screen factory that could employ about 5,200 people , according to a project document circulating among state legislators .
Snyder said Tuesday he was in Japan for “ dinner and a day ” to discuss a pending trade deal , although his office did not previously disclose it . The governor did not say more , citing nondisclosure agreements .
But even if the incentive plan could bring Foxconn to Michigan , Johnson and Howrylak said it picks winners and losers , and amounts to corporate welfare .
Hammoud 's opposition came for a different reason . The legislation could lead to a “ race to the bottom ” as states fight with each other to offer sweeter and sweeter deals to huge companies , he said .
Senate Majority Leader Arlan Meekhof has said it could lead to $ 3 billion to $ 5 billion in private investment .
The plan would allow a company to keep half of new employee income taxes if it creates at least 500 jobs paying an average regional wage . It could withhold all of its income taxes to the state if it creates at least 250 jobs paying 25 percent more than that .
The Michigan Strategic Fund could approve up to 15 projects a year , and the total value of incentive commitments could not top $ 250 million at any time .
Sen. Jim Stamas , the Midland Republican who sponsored the legislation in the upper chamber , said Michigan needs the legislation to create new jobs at a time when companies are competing with other states with better economic incentive plans .
“ If there are no jobs , there 's no money , ” Stamas said .
The plan cleared the Senate in a 32-5 vote in March . Wednesday 's House Tax Policy Committee hearing was the first public step for the legislation in the House .

We all know that education system is totally corrupt in Balochistan because the result is in front of us in the shape of the cheating culture in the province . However , Balochistan is the richest province in terms of minerals but it stands totally ignored in terms of education .
Since many changes are going to come in Balochistan in the wake of CPEC but what I think the main change should come in education system if the citizens of Balochistan do not get education then how they will take benefit of the CPEC project . Of course the people of Balochistan wo n't be able to take benefit of CPEC if they are not educated .So , I request the government of Pakistan and China please pay a little attention towards the education system of Balochistan so that the people of neglected province should take benefit of CPEC .

At a candidate forum for Democrats preparing to challenge Congresswoman Elise Stefanik of New York , the youngest woman in Congress , one of the candidates proclaimed , “ I probably deserve to be called a sexist , ” did not back down from calling the congresswoman “ a little girl ” and went on to call her “ a child . ”
Democrat Steve Krieg , a Plattsburgh City School Board member , declared : “ I have been accused of being a sexist for calling Elise a little girl . Uh , and I probably deserve to be called a sexist . I think most of us if we admit it have some sexist in us , racist within us . It 's something that if we 're decent people , we recognize in ourselves and we struggle with it all of our lives . But Elise [ Stefanik ] , I recognize her , I 'm not going to say as a little girl , I recognize her as a child . And it has nothing to do with her age . I see her as a child because she 's a child . She thinks like a child . She has people set things up for her , she has people put their words in her mouth and she happily repeats them . And I think recognizing her , I would go after her in that way . And I apologize if that 's mean but that 's how I would do it . ”
It 's worth noting that none of the other Democratic candidates on the stage objected to that language or characterization . One again we see the consistent principle of , ” it 's only sexism when someone in the other party does it . ”
Earlier in the year , the National Republican Congressional Committee noted that the Democrats had not listed Stefanik 's 21st Congressional District in New York among their 59 highest-priority target seats .
Stefanik won by a “ mere ” 35 points in 2016 , or “ only ” about 91,000 votes .
If your child is heading off to college , choosing a state school can mean big savings . Pick a university outside your home state , and you 'll pay a premium .
Students at in-state public colleges and universities save an average of almost $ 24,000 a year , compared with their peers at private institutions . Crossing state lines can more than double the cost of tuition , even for a public college .
Consumer Reports says that under certain circumstances , you may be able to pay the in-state price .
Donna Rosato , Consumer Reports ' Money Editor , says , `` A number of states are welcoming students who want to stay and work after college . It can be a significant savings to pay in-state tuition , but it 's not always easy to do . ''
One key is to establish residency . The rules vary by state , but some basic guidelines apply . First , move as early as possible . Most schools require that you live in-state for a full year before you enroll in school , to qualify as an in-state student .
Expect to provide proof of residency . Things like tax returns , property records and an in-state driver 's license all can help make your case .
It 's also important to cut financial ties to your original , home state . Which could be a dealbreaker for many college students , who are often claimed as dependents by their parents .
Rosato advises , `` Establishing residency is n't a game and schools enforce their rules rigorously . You have to really be in it for the right reasons . ''
Consumer Reports says you should also be on the lookout for exceptions . Some colleges and universities may let you establish residency while you 're in school .

CEBU City Mayor Tomas Osmeña clarified that the ambulance that was recently turned over to Barangay Sambag I is not a reward for the Guardos for joining BOPK .
In his news conference yesterday , Osmeña said he did not sign any document stating that the ambulance now belongs to the Barangay Mayor 's Office ( BMO ) of Sambag I .
Cebu City Disaster Risk Reduction Management Office ( CCDRRMO ) chief Nagiel Bañacia also clarified that the City Government still owns the ambulance .
He reacted to Sambag I Barangay Captain Lemar Alcover 's filing of an administrative complaint against Osmeña , Councilors Mary Ann delos Santos , Sisinio Andales , Eugenio Gabuya Jr. and suspended Councilor Jerry Guardo before the Ombudsman-Visayas last week .
Alcover accused the city officials of violating the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act and malversation of public funds after the turnover of a City-owned ambulance to the wife of Guardo .
Osmeña believes the opposition is behind the move .
He said the emergency vehicle is not a reward for the Guardos after the councilor bolted Team Rama to join the Bando Osmeña Pundok Kauswagan ( BOPK ) .
Guardo 's wife Ailien is the head of the barangay 's BMO .
Osmeña said Ailien is an adviser in the barangay and she can advise how the ambulance will be used , but the emergency will not be in her possession .
In a separate interview , Bañacia explained that the ambulance is still under the emergency response unit of the City .
The CCDDRMO also supervises the personnel assigned to the emergency vehicle .
Alcover 's complaint stemmed from the city officials ' decision to turn over the ambulance , which was received by Ailien , a private individual , and not by the barangay officials .
“ It is highly illegal and irregular because the recipient is not an appointed , nor an elected government official or employee , and not an accountable officer , ” he said .
He pointed out that the Local Government Code provides that the barangay treasurer , who is in-charge of the barangay 's funds and properties , is the “ right ” accountable officer . RVC and CNU Intern Czarina B. Rodriguez
UFC champion Conor McGregor and boxing legend Floyd Mayweather Jr. have finally closed a deal to square off in a highly-anticipated boxing match this August in Las Vegas .
Mayweather posted the announcement on social media on Wednesday with the words , “ IT 'S OFFICIAL ! ! ! ” McGregor , well known for his trash-talking , also posted an announcement saying , “ THE FIGHT IS ON , ” along with a picture of himself and Mayweather 's father .
The pay-per-view match will take place on August 26 at the MGM Grand Garden Arena .
Mayweather is widely regarded as one of the best boxers of all time , having compiled a professional record of 49-0 in his career . He retired from boxing in 2015 after a unanimous decision victory over Andre Berto . Prior to that , Mayweather fought Manny Pacquiao in what became the highest-grossing pay-per-view fight of all time . Initial reports indicated the Pacquiao fight generated more than 4.4 million U.S. buys and more than $ 400 million in domestic pay-per-view revenue alone , with the event jointly produced by HBO and Showtime . Live gate receipts for the event , also held at the MGM Grand , produced more than $ 71 million in revenue , compared with the previous live gate record of $ 20 million ( for the Mayweather vs. “ Canelo ” Álvarez fight ) .

Protests are planned in central-Iowa today as Wells Fargo holds its annual meeting for shareholders .
Maurice B.P.-Weeks of the Action Center on Race and the Economy says his groups and others have one goal in the protests . “ Really to bring attention to and demands to the bank that is out of control with both their size , and their abuse with business practices , ” he says . It is the first time the Wells Fargo Board will meet in Des Moines and the event comes on the heels of federal regulators hitting the bank with a $ 1 billion fine for loan abuses . Wells Fargo has also been fined after workers created millions of fake accounts to gain incentives .
B.P-Weeks says his group and others are protesting because of the impact on certain groups . “ They are sort of America 's worst bank in many categories , ” B.P.-Weeks says , “ and many of those categories are targeting black and brown folk. ” B.P-Weeks says they have four “ Wells needs to get rid of their entire board of directors and the CEO Tim Sloan . They need to break up the bank . Wells needs to pay restitution to all of their various victims across all those different areas of their abusive business practices . And finally , to respect the workers ' right to organize without retaliation , ” he says .
B.P.-Weeks says they are hoping the company will hear their protest and make changes . “ Right now we have a petition that 's going on-line that has at last check has well over 15,000 signatures , ” he says . “ We are going to be at a later date delivering that to Wells Fargo . We certainly hope that the board and the CEO does respond. ” Wells Fargo has about 16,000 employees across the state — with the bulk of them working in Des Moines and the surrounding metro area .
PanARMENIAN.Net - The powerful documentary “ Architects of Denial ” posits that denying such world atrocities as the 1915-18 killings of Armenians by the Ottoman Empire , which became the modern republic of Turkey , results only in history repeating itself , The Los Angeles Times said in its review of the documentary which premieres in select U.S. theaters on Friday , October 6 .
According to the article , producer-director David Lee George persuasively backs up this theory by taking a frank look at the horrors of the Armenian Genocide as well as the modern-day persecution of Armenians by forces in Turkey and its ally , Azerbaijan .
`` The movie also deftly places the systematic annihilation of Armenians within the context of latter-day genocides in such places as Sudan , Rwanda , Cambodia and Guatemala . Most dramatic , however , is the narrative 's chilling reminder of how a lack of accountability over the Armenian Genocide led Adolf Hitler to believe that the world would also turn a blind eye to his 'Final Solution , ' '' LA Times says .
`` George combines a wide array of strong , if at times grisly , archival footage and photos with remarkable interviews with two centenarian survivors of the killings , plus moving commentary from many Armenians whose relatives perished in that first massacre and/or more recent conflicts across Azerbaijan . ''
Historians , academics , genocide experts , authors and WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange also provide perspective about such issues as how the United States ( taken to task here at great length ) , Britain and others , under political pressure from the Turkish government , which disputes that a Genocide took place , officially avoid using the G-word to describe this historical reality .
Some three dozen countries , hundreds of local government bodies and international organizations have so far recognized the killings of 1.5 million Armenian in the Ottoman Empire as Genocide . Turkey denies to this day .
by Kerry SHERIDAN People who fly on airplanes while contagious can indeed get other people sick , but the risk is mainly to those seated next to them or in the adjacent row , US researchers said Monday .
The study in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences ( PNAS ) is the first to quantify the odds of getting sick based on a passenger 's proximity to an infectious person .
Researchers studied 10 transcontinental flights and meticulously tracked passenger movements to estimate the likelihood of common respiratory infections like severe acute respiratory syndrome ( SARS ) and influenza , which are spread by tiny droplets in the air and on surfaces .
`` Passengers seated within one row and within two seats laterally of the infected passenger had an 80 percent or greater probability of becoming infected , '' said the study .
`` For all other passengers , the probability of infection was less than three percent . ''
Researchers also warned that infectious crew members could infect an average of 4.6 passengers per flight .
`` Thus , it is imperative that flight attendants not fly when they are ill , '' said the study led by researchers at Emory University and the Georgia Institute of Technology .
The good news is that public health guidelines typically go even further , urging those seated within two rows of an infected passenger to undergo surveillance for certain contagious diseases .
`` The authors ' model argues that it requires you to be closer than previously reported -- within one row and two seats of an infected passenger -- as opposed to two rows regarding the greatest risk of becoming ill on an airplane , '' said Lenox Hill Hospital emergency physician Robert Glatter , who was not involved in the study .
`` But the risk was significantly less if you were seated beyond two rows of an infected person who was coughing or sneezing . These runs counter to traditional thinking that if a person coughs or sneezes anywhere in the cabin , they will infect the entire plane . ''
- Public health concern -The study , which was conducted during flu season , reported only one person actively coughing , `` which is often not the experience of the flying public , '' Glatter added .
Swabs for respiratory viruses on tray tables and seatbelts also showed no trace of viruses , suggesting that most illness is spread by sneezing and coughing , not droplets that fall on surfaces or the ground .
`` Meticulous attention to handwashing , or using hand sanitizer remain important ways to reduce your risk of becoming ill during air travel , '' said Glatter .
Traveling while contagious is `` an important public health concern '' given that three billion passengers per year travel by air , said the report .
In 2014 , a woman who was infected with Ebola flew from Cleveland to Dallas the night before she was hospitalized .
Her trip raised alarm about the prospect of a public health emergency , but luckily , no one was infected .
According to Michael Grosso , chair of pediatrics at Northwell Health 's Huntington Hospital in Huntington , New York , the study helps clarify what has long been rumored .
`` I think everyone knows that travelers often experience the onset of a cold within a couple of days after flying and they naturally connect the two , '' he said .

With the second season of “ Westworld ” upon us , HBO has high hopes the sophomore series will continue growing into a bona fide hit . But if there are ambitions that the sci-fi saga can reach the kind of audience the network 's reigning hit , “ Game of Thrones , ” does , that 's doubtful .
If the latest episodes are any indication , the “ Westworld ” narrative remain too complicated for the show 's own good . While dense mythology is a fixture of other TV greats like ABC 's “ Lost , ” “ Westworld ” seems to have too much faith viewers will be willing to absorb storylines that can border on the incomprehensible .
While killer robots and blood-soaked violence are the ingredients of a TV crowd-pleaser , “ Westworld ” is n't as accessible a series as some of the true hits that have graced premium networks and streaming services in recent years . There will be a very vocal core fan base willing to do the homework of piecing together the show 's many mysteries , but that 's not broad enough a base to be the kind of flagship series HBO wants .
It will be interesting to see if HBO will have the capacity to spend top dollar on such a lavish production for years to come if “ Westworld ” is n't the “ Thrones ” -sized hit the network hoped it would be .

UNTOLD STORY : Why Baryamureeba Quit UTAMU To Rejoin Mak
Secrets have emerged why Prof Venenscias Baryamureeba is rejoining Makerere which he bitterly left five years ago . He joined others to found UTAMU in which he until recently owned 20 % shares . He carried with him many disgruntled Makerere dons who are now grumbling and regretting why they fell for his rhetoric .
These include Prof Prossy Bantebya , Flavia Tushabe , Grace Lubega , Ngubiri , Dr. Rehema Baguma etc . From UMI , he lured Dr. Benon Basheka who became VC but has since fallen out with him . He also targeted MUBS and took Dr. Joseph Sewanyana who became Chairman UTAMU Council before acrimoniously falling out after Barya insisted to knife some members of staff who disagreed with his views .
Ernest Mwebaze also quit UTAMU after Barya turned out the very opposite of what he thought he was .
“ When he was leaving Makerere in 2012 , he mobilized many senior dons to join him in founding UTAMU which was a joint venture to which all of them invested their lifetime savings . But as of now whoever you speak to will tell you stories of disappointment on how Baryamureeba used them and later dumped them using tricks , ” says one of the pals known to Barya for long .
“ It was agreed all shareholders would work without pay for the first two years but would earn commission on every deal or consultancy projects they bring . That is how many of those PhD dons he misled to resign their jobs at CIT [ Faculty of Computing at Makerere ] were supposed to make ends meet . But he turned against them refusing to release their commission . Sometimes he would cut people 's commission claiming to have paid it to URA as taxes . He had recruited allies within the UTAMU accounts department with whom he would deceive that so much has been paid to URA whereas not , ” said another disappointed UTAMU founder .
“ Whereas we agreed to be volunteers , he was busy eating on every deal to maintain his extravagant lifestyle . He failed to adjust and accept the fact that his well paying Makerere VC job was no more . He continued hanging out in high places and spending on his female friends . UTAMU was giving him Shs5m per month when everybody else was earning zero salary but he was never satisfied and would go behind fellow founders ' backs to make deals yet he kept telling us we were building for the future , ” tearfully narrated one of the many UTAMU shareholders .
The resultant mistrust prompted UTAMU bosses to write to banks asking them to shun Barya . UTAMU VC Prof Benon Basheka wrote letters to banks where UTAMU runs operational accounts warning them to deal with Barya at their own risk . Barya had been the sole principal signatory to all UTAMU bank accounts and resisted being replaced even after colleagues lost trust in him .
Colleagues raised concerns about his extravagant lifestyle and demanded accountability for past transactions . UTAMU had accounts in Standard Chartered Bank and Equity Bank and hundreds of millions were being kept there .
This is money UTAMU would be making from tuition and from consultancy projects or services it offers or projects mostly attracted by Prof Benon Basheka who quit his lucrative UMI job to replace Barya as UTAMU VC . The money paid to URA would be exaggerated to silence this demanding accountability . Barya then tried to recruit Peter Kinyera as the UTAMU F/A Manager but other directors objected saying Kinyera was subject to manipulation .
When he stood for Presidency , UTAMU bosses were unhappy he never formally informed them . They just saw it on news .
“ His plan was to continue micromanaging UTAMU through Kinyera but we refused and bad blood started . He ceased to be VC and became Chairman BOD but kept particular interest in the finance department . We became more suspicious and Prof Basheka could n't believe this is the Barya he knew . He started telling us the man has changed , ” says a UTAMU insider .
As Chairman BOD , Barya tried to get the UTAMU Appointments Board members to recruit his man Peter Kinyera as Finance Manager and sole signatory to all UTAMU operations accounts . The others opposed it saying this was a plot to push Kinyera in top management to spy for Barya . Barya wanted Kinyera to earn Shs6m per month but the others refused arguing more qualified PhD holders were n't earning even a half of that . Barya drafted Kinyera 's appointment letter but others refused to recognize it .
BARYA B'MES W/BLOWER
Barya furiously decided to spoil things for UTAMU . He became a whistle blower petitioning the Institute of Certified Public Accountants of Uganda ( ICPAU ) accusing UTAMU Chief Accountant Baker Sekito of fraudulent financial activities including evading URA taxes to the tune of Shs400m .
He accused Sekito , his former close friend in UTAMU , of professional misconduct and proposed that ICPAU blacklists him . He also asked ICPAU to work with URA to expose UTAMU with a view of exposing financial malpractices in its accountability systems .
Barya 's letter to ICPAU shows that as of June 2016 , UTAMU had evaded taxes worth Shs400m and that Baker Sekito was the chief architect of all this fraud . In August 24th communiqué , the ICPAU CEO/Secretary Derrick Nkaja accused Sekito of flouting the provisions of the Accountants Act ( 2015 ) and asked him to defend himself against Barya allegations . UTAMU bosses asked Barya to leave them since he has only 20 % in the business .
They locked the office he was using and offered him a very small room in their rented Bugoloobi premises . Barya , who had badly lost 2016 polls , became very frustrated and rumors emerged he was in talks to join Kansanga-based International University of East Africa as a shareholder and lecturer .
When this did n't materialize , Barya renewed dreams to head Makerere once again . He believed some were nostalgic because of Ddumba 's failures . Sometime in September 2016 , UTAMU shareholders called an AGM meeting to vote for Barya 's expulsion arguing his petition alleging tax evasion had made it impossible to work with him anymore .
The meeting was to also allow Basheka 's proposal to publish a newspaper notice showing he was no longer part of UTAMU but in that meeting , Barya apologized and members allowed him a decent quiet exit without the newspaper embarrassment .
On learning of all this , Prof Fred Kayanja ( former MUST VC ) whom Barya had previously recruited as UTAMU Chairman became very disappointed and vowed to quit but Basheka begged him to stay fearing the bad press his departure would create .
Many resented Barya 's dictatorship when he banned anybody discussing his failed presidential bid on the UTAMU social media platforms . Besides Barya 's 20 % shareholding , the other UTAMU original owners included Catherine Kanabahita , Johnson Mwebaze , Jude Lubega , Drake Patrick Mirembe , John Ngubiri and Ernest Mwebaze among others .
In between them they had 80 % shareholding as against Barya 's mere 20 % . These ganged up to force Baryamureeba out of UTAMU University , leaving him strictly to have financial control over UTAMU Ltd , a parent company under which founders intended to operate many other enterprises .
The University was to be just one of the enterprises . Leaving him to control UTAMU Ltd was as good as chasing Barya as it 's just in name without any operational enterprises . These are some of the reasons Barya badly wants back his Makerere job .
BEIJING , Dec 11 ( APP ) : Although there are hundreds of thousands of Chinese students who decide every year to further their education in Western countries , there are still some who choose instead to head to the Middle East .
Mostly Muslims , these Chinese students usually have to jump through far more hoops to go to their ideal universities than those going to the United States or the European Union , according to Global Times on Monday .
Omer , a Muslim student in his mid-20s from North China 's Shanxi Province , is currently studying at the University of Jordan in Amman . It has been his dream to study in an Arab country since he first began studying Arabic in high school .
Omer chose Jordan as his destination since it was one of the region 's more stable countries . During the holidays , he enjoys visiting historic sites in the region like the Egyptian pyramids and the temples in Baalbek , Lebanon .
During a trip back to China earlier this year , Omer married Sophia , who is from Northwest China 's Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region . When Omer headed back to the Middle East to continue his studies , his new wife , who was also accepted into the University of Jordan , decided to join him . The two rent a one-bedroom apartment near campus for roughly 2,000 yuan ( $ 300 ) a month , which Omer finds expensive .
While Omer has grown fond of Jordan , another Chinese student , Eid , has grown homesick during his time in the Middle East .
Eid , from Gansu Province , is not yet 20 years old . He said that he gained a new appreciation for China after heading to Cairo to study . He expressed that he was particularly turned off by locals who hang around tourist attractions begging for money .
One of the advantages Chinese students enjoy while studying in the Middle East is lower tuition fees than back home .
However , due to some of the instability in the region , Chinese students frequently run into problems with their visas . Some students have said that they have been declined entry at customs for no apparent reason when returning from vacations in China .

NHL players have begun to prepare themselves for the next NHL lockout . In recent years , there has been a drastic uptick in the number of NHL contracts that have a significant portion of the compensation paid in the form of signing bonuses rather than base salary alone . This increase in the number of bonus heavy contracts seems to point to a widespread concern among NHL players about the possibility of another season lost due to a lockout . From the moment the NHL Collective Bargaining Agreement ( CBA ) was signed , there has been rampant speculation that another substantial work stoppage is likely . Now it appears that the players have begun to actively plan for that eventuality .
How Do NHL Signing Bonuses Work ?
To see how signing bonuses play a role in future CBA negotiations , and a potential lockout , it is important to first to understand what these signing bonuses really are .
In more traditional businesses signing bonuses are paid once an employee signs a contract with the company . These bonuses are often paid to entice the employee to take a reduced salary , or otherwise lessened benefit package . Though each contract is unique and may have other specific requirements , signing bonuses are generally payable irrespective of the performance of the contract .
NHL signing bonuses are similar but there is one very important difference . Traditional signing bonuses are paid as a single lump-sum payment . NHL signing bonuses may be paid in multiple installments of varying amounts across multiple contract years , typically when the new league year begins on July 1 . While these bonuses may vary from season to season , they are still included when calculating the annual average value of the contract for salary cap purposes . For example , Artemi Panarin 's contract for the 2018-19 season has a base salary of $ 4 million and a signing bonus of $ 2 million , for a total annual salary of $ 6 million .
The most important thing to remember about these signing bonuses is that while they may vary in size and structure from contract to contract , in general , they will be paid out whether or not the player ever plays a single game for the team . This includes if a season is delayed , shortened , or canceled for any reason , including a work stoppage . The way these bonuses are paid has been prominently on display recently . Prior to being traded , the trade rumors that swirled around Ryan O'Reilly focused on his high signing bonus , and whether the Buffalo Sabres or the prospective acquiring teams would be responsible for paying it . Buffalo and St. Louis were able to complete the trade for the talented center on July 1 , allowing the responsibility for paying the bonus to also transfer to St. Louis .
BUF gets 1st in 19 , 2nd in 21 , Tage Thompson , Vladimir Sobotka , Patrick Betglund for Ryan O'Reilly . No salary retained . STL pays ROR signing bonus . — Bob McKenzie ( @ TSNBobMcKenzie ) July 2 , 2018
Players Are Preparing for a Lockout
The opening of Free Agency this year featured a perfect high profile example of a contract loaded with signing bonuses ; John Tavares ' new contract with his hometown Toronto Maple Leafs . As Pierre LeBrun reported , Tavares ' 11-year deal contains just $ 6.11 million in base salary , which is less than 8 % of the total value of the contract . In fact , in the first year , Tavares will make only $ 650,000 in base salary . This is the equivalent of the league minimum . Because the contract is over 92 % bonuses , Tavares is guaranteed $ 70.89 million in signing bonuses over the life of the contract , whether or not he ever plays a single game .
Correction on Year 2 signing bonus , it 's $ 14.99M , not $ 15.25M . So official breakdown reads like this : Year 1 , $ 650k salary , $ 15.25M sb ; Year 2 , $ 910k salary , $ 14.99 M sb ; Year 3 , $ 910k salary , $ 11.09M sb ; Year 4 , $ 910k salary , $ 8.44M sb ; Years 5-7 , $ 910k salary , $ 7.04M sb each yr https : //t.co/fqt0dFwl4K — Pierre LeBrun ( @ PierreVLeBrun ) July 1 , 2018
John Tavares is not the only high profile player to agree to a contract with a significant signing bonus . Jakub Voracek , Jamie Benn , Carey Price , Steven Stamkos , and Connor McDavid are just a handful of recent examples of star players who have signed these sorts of contracts . While all of the deals these players signed contain substantial bonuses , they are all structured very differently . Some of the contracts have the signing bonuses in every year , providing guaranteed money throughout the life of the deal , while others have been structured simply to be “ lockout-proof . ”
Leon Draisaitl and his agents negotiated what may be the prototypical lockout-proof contract . Draisaitl 's compensation is paid exclusively through the base salary in most of the years . He has a base salary of $ 9 million in 2018-19 , $ 9 million in 2019-20 , $ 8 million in 2021-22 , $ 8 million in 2023-24 , and $ 8 million in 2024-25 . There are no bonuses payable in these seasons . However , in the two possible lockout seasons , 2020-21 and 2022-23 , his base salary drops to $ 2 million and $ 1 million respectively with signing bonuses of $ 7 million in each of those years . His contract structure dictates that , whether or not there is a lockout , he is guaranteed to be paid $ 7 million for those seasons .
Victor Hedman and his agents took a slightly different approach to guarantee his security regardless of the specifics of any new CBA . In addition to signing bonuses in 2020-21 and 2022-23 , Hedman 's contract also has signing bonuses in 2023-23 and 2024-25 . It is impossible to predict what a new CBA might entail and how it might change the way players are paid . This structure adds additional security and ensures Hedman will be well paid those amounts no matter the outcome of a new Collective Bargaining Agreement .
NHL Showdown Ahead
The CBA is set to expire on September 15 , 2022 . However , the terms of the current agreement would extend on a year-to-year basis from that date , unless the league or NHL Players Association ( NHLPA ) give written notice by May 18 , 2022 , that they intend to terminate the agreement . This date is crucial .
Of late , one key point of the CBA has become widely reported . Section 3.1 paragraph ( b ) of the CBA is the so-called opt-out clause that gives the league and the NHLPA the right to terminate the agreement before the start of the 2020-21 season .
Even more foreboding was the recent failed attempt to extend the current CBA . The league made an offer to allow players to participate in the Olympics in South Korea , in exchange for extending the current CBA by three years . The NHLPA rejected the offer due to a variety of concerns about the current deal , not the least of which is the mandated escrow payments by the players . This may seem trivial , it may also serve as the canary in the coal mine that points to trouble ahead .
The NHLPA remembers how much their bargaining power was hurt during previous lockouts with much of their membership desperate to get back on the ice and the players undoubtedly have n't forgotten how much lighter their pocketbooks were . During the 2005-06 lockout and the shortened season in 2012-13 , only a handful of players is fortunate enough to have the sort of security that signing bonuses afford . Today many players are doing everything they can to make sure that wo n't be the case again .
At the same time , the negotiations that followed the cancellation of the 2004-05 season were a huge success for Commissioner Gary Bettman . He was able to shepherd in the current CBA , and it not only instituted the hard salary cap owners were clamoring for , but it also reduced player salaries by more than 20 % . These were both tremendous wins for ownership .
These massive victories were the direct result of Bettman 's hardline negotiating tactics and his willingness to cancel an entire season to get what the owners wanted . Bettman remained steadfast and unwavering while hundreds of players were out of work and desperate to return . The pressure on the NHLPA to get players back on the ice was what gave Bettman and the league the leverage they needed to ask for everything they could possibly want and get it .
As more and more players continue to sign contracts with significant signing bonuses , the leverage that made the NHL so successful in past negotiations is slipping away . Commissioner Bettman garnered tremendous support from the owners because of his deft handling of previous negotiations . If teams continue to hand out massive signing bonuses , particularly for years in which a work stoppage is likely , Bettman will struggle to retain even a portion of the leverage he once had . These contracts and the bonuses they carry will drastically alter the balance of power at the negotiating table and will affect the NHL for years to come .

GENEVA ( Reuters ) - The U.N. human rights office has “ strong indications ” that Mexican federal security forces are behind a wave of disappearances in and around the city of Nuevo Laredo , a statement from the U.N. human rights chief said on Wednesday .
Mexican officials did not immediately respond to the UN allegations .
The U.N. has documented the disappearance of 21 men and two women in Nuevo Laredo in Tamaulipas State from February until May 16 this year , the statement from U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein said .
“ Many of these people are reported to have been arbitrarily detained and disappeared while going about their daily lives , ” the statement quoted Zeid as saying .
A local human rights organization put the number of disappearances in Nuevo Laredo at more than 40 , and the U.N. human rights office received testimonies that they were allegedly perpetrated by a federal security force , often late at night or at dawn , the statement said .
The report is the latest finding by international groups highlighting alleged abuses by the government in its decade-long battle against criminal gangs .
More than 35,000 people have gone missing since former President Felipe Calderon sent military forces to battle drug gangs in late 2006 .
There have been more than 200,000 murders since then , with a record number last year fuelling widespread anger with President Enrique Pena Nieto 's ruling party ahead of a July 1 presidential election .
“ Mexico is a mutilated country that stinks of blood , where you step on a mass grave wherever you go , ” said Fernando Rios , head of local human rights group Red TDT , in response to the U.N report .
Zeid has called on Mexican authorities to end the disappearances “ amid strong indications that these crimes have been committed by federal security forces ” , the statement said .
“ It is particularly horrific that at least five of the victims are minors , with three of them as young as 14 . These crimes , perpetrated over four months in a single municipality , are outrageous , ” he said .
The authorities had ample information and evidence but had made little progress in investigating , the statement said , noting relatives of those missing had so far found the bodies of at least six victims .
Mexico 's National Human Rights Commission asked the Navy and others to protect the population of Tamaulipas , but at least three disappearances had happened since then .
Zeid said the events were a litmus test of whether Mexico 's new General Law on Disappearances represented real change or a continued failure of justice .
“ In the case of enforced disappearance and extrajudicial executions carried out by public officials , it is even more urgent for the state to act to demonstrate that it neither condones nor tolerates the commission of such grave violations , ” he said .

Union minister Arun Jaitley had filed a defamation case against Arvind Kejriwal over the usage of “ scandalous ” words by his former counsel during proceedings of a defamation case . Photo : Pradeep Gaur/Mint
New Delhi : The Delhi high court is likely to give its verdict on Tuesday in one of the interlocutory applications in the second defamation suit filed by Union minister Arun Jaitley against Aam Aadmi Party ( AAP ) national convener and Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal .
The Union minister had filed a defamation case against Kejriwal over the usage of “ scandalous ” words by his former counsel during proceedings of a defamation case .
In the previous hearing in November , Kejriwal 's lawyers had told the court that the suit was based on hearsay evidence and thus inadmissible .
According to PTI , Kejriwal made the submission before justice Manmohan , who is also hearing his separate application urging the court to strike down Jaitley 's response to his defamation suit of Rs10 crore after Kejriwal 's counsel confirmed that the words against the Union minister were used following instructions .
In his application , Kejriwal said that he was not present in court on the day the comments were made .
Kejriwal was earlier being represented by Ram Jethmalani , who in September announced his retirement as an advocate . The words were allegedly used while cross-examining Jaitley in a separate Rs10 crore defamation case filed by the Union minister against Kejriwal and five other AAP leaders in 2015 .
Jaitley 's lawyers had said Kejriwal had neither substantiated his claim that he did not instruct his former lawyer to use such words , nor did he initiate any action against his former counsel for using scandalous words without his permission .
In 2015 , AAP leaders had alleged corruption charges against Jaitley in a case related to financial irregularities in the Delhi and District Cricket Association ( DDCA ) .

When it comes to the Vietnam Way , Craig McNamara has a unique perspective and experience unlike any other in America – his father Robert McNamara was the Secretary of Defense during the war . At an early KVIE screening of The Vietnam War , Craig spoke with my boss , Vice President of Content Creation Michael Sanford , in front a live group of donors . I started recording on my phone and never stopped . The video is not PBS quality – it 's my smartphone . But the content and the words shared here must be heard .
I believe we must learn from the past . At times , history has a scary way of repeating itself . So many lives were crushed in the Vietnam War ; Americans and Vietnamese were killed and wounded . American soldiers were treated horribly upon their return home . The 60s and 70s were a horrendously uprooting time for those who served and those in the antiwar movement at home . But for Craig McNamara , the pain is deeply personal in a very different way . Craig , a life-long objector to the Vietnam War , is the son of Robert McNamara , known as the “ Architect of the Vietnam War , ” making him one of the most controversial figures in American history . When Craig was in elementary school , his dad left his powerful position as President of Ford Motor Company to answer the call of the President of the United States . President John F. Kennedy had just been elected and the McNamaras moved to the nation 's capital . Robert McNamara served as the Secretary of Defense through the Kennedy and Johnson administrations . Craig was tormented for more than a decade as he tried to make peace with the fact that he loved the caring man that was his father – but not the politically explosive figure his dad had become . Craig , his mother , and his sister were totally against the Vietnam War . Regardless , that was Craig 's daddy , and that ripped him apart for decades .
I have worked closely with Craig at many events , mainly at the California State Capitol , watching him literally pound the dirt for agriculture across the Golden State . He is one of the finest men I know and has had to search his soul – and the world – to find peace . I would like to think that him agreeing to me sharing this story with you will help bring a little more light into your own heart . Craig 's message is one of grace and forgiveness . His deep love of both veterans and Vietnamese is what I believe has helped transform his soul to a place of healing . So , listen to this interview . Craig looks exactly like his father . Hear his words – his story – and add it to every Vietnam story that is so deeply important to marinate your mind and heart inside .
You can also get to know this history by watching Ken Burns and Lynn Novick 's latest documentary The Vietnam War . All 10 parts are available to stream online for KVIE members . It 's hard to watch , but so important to see . And you can see other perspectives on the Vietnam War from people who live in our region with My Vietnam War Story .

SACRAMENTO , Calif. ( AP )  Gov . Jerry Brown has signed legislation that reduces the penalty for intentionally exposing some to HIV .
The legislation signed Friday is part of an attempt by Democratic lawmakers to reverse the tough policies enacted during the AIDS scare of the 1980s and '90s .
Under those policies , intentionally exposing someone to HIV was a felony . SB239 reduces the crime to a misdemeanor , treating HIV like other communicable diseases .
Democratic Sen. Scott Wiener of San Francisco says the harsher penalties for HIV discourage people from getting tested for the disease and stigmatize those who have it .

Critics say the bill would endanger people .
Lawmakers last year approved legislation allowing people with HIV to receive transplants from HIV-positive donors , reversing a ban imposed amid widespread fear about the disease .
A 29-year veteran of the Oakland County Sheriffs Office and father of 11 continues to recover after a freak accident on the job severely injured his hand .
Deputy Tom Kangas lost his right trigger finger and had his middle finger crushed in mid-February when an excavator grapple bucket closed in on his hand . Hes sustained extensive tissue and nerve damage throughout his hand .
Since the accident and subsequent surgeries , Kangas has been receiving 80 percent of his base pay through workers compensation  leaving a marked gap in the finances of this husband and father who was used to working overtime to support his large family .
Five of his and wife Rebeccas children are afflicted with Chiari Malformation , a rare brain disorder with hydrocephalus , requiring multiple surgeries per year .

The expulsion of Joice Mujuru from both government and ruling party , in December 2014 , was a typically brilliant political gambit from Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe . With one stroke , he removed a major threat to his power from within Zanu-PF , and lumbered his opponents outside the party with a dangerous , destabilising new player .
And Mujuru did not disappoint . Along with a handful of other Zanu-PF exiles , most prominently Didymus Mutasa and Rugare Gumbo , Mujuru established Zimbabwe People First ( ZimPF ) just under a year ago , and demanded her seat at the opposition table .
It 's a crowded table . Although Morgan Tsvangirai 's Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC-T ) is the undisputed heavyweight , there are more than a dozen smaller parties all vying for airtime . These were mostly known quantities , however , unlike Mujuru 's ZimPF . How much support did she really have ? Could she tap into traditionally Zanu-PF constituencies ? Could such a longtime Zanu-PF stalwart , and formerly close Mugabe ally , really be trusted ?
With the 2018 elections on the horizon , one thing Zimbabwe 's opposition parties can agree on is that it is vital to present a united front . A strong opposition coalition will beat Mugabe . A weak , fractured opposition will be easy pickings for Zanu-PF 's formidable electoral machine . But the presence of ZimPF made the negotiations around that coalition exponentially more complicated – especially because Mujuru was angling to be leader .
As one of Tsvangirai 's senior advisors told the Daily Maverick , speaking anonymously : “ We know we need to work with Mujuru . But it feels like we are dealing with the devil . ”
Perhaps that 's why the MDC-T has been so slow to agree to any deal . Although coalition negotiations are at an advanced stage , Tsvangirai has been reluctant to put pen to paper – and now his patience has been handsomely rewarded .
In the space of three tumultuous weeks , ZimPF 's credibility has unravelled . The first major stumbling block was in the Bikita West by-election , in which ZimPF 's candidate was handsomely defeated by the Zanu-PF candidate . The defeat revealed not only the fragility of ZimPF 's supposed constituency , but also highlighted internal divisions within the new party .
“ It is unclear why ZimPF… put up a candidate in the Bikita West election at all , ” observed International Crisis Group 's Piers Pigou . “ There were internal ZimPF tensions over whether or not to participate , and the provincial party leaders who pushed against it have now resigned . In the end , the failure of ZimPF 's candidate in Bikita West has now damaged ZimPF leader Mujuru 's prospects of leading an opposition coalition in the 2018 elections . ”
Things were about to get even worse . Last week , a coterie of senior party officials including Mutasa and Gumbo were abruptly expelled from the party , bringing those internal tensions into stark relief . Insults flew between the various factions . Mutasa 's crowd then claimed that actually they had expelled Mujuru from the party .
“ The problem is that they were an untested entity when they were together , and they remain untested as separate entities . I presume having fired each other there 's going to be some kind of legal fight over the assets , the name , etc . That will occupy them for months . For me it 's a further manifestation of opposition fragmentation , and unfortunately a reflection of the sad politics of personality that continues to characterise politics in Zimbabwe , ” Pigou told the Daily Maverick , in a separate comment .
Alex Magaisa , political analyst and former adviser to Tsvangirai , said that ZimPF 's apparent implosion did not come as a surprise . “ This was a group of disgruntled people who left Zanu-PF not because they wanted to , but because they were caught up in challenges within Zanu-PF . The unity between them was more because of their predicament than the values they shared . There was bound to be trouble at some point . ”
Magaisa argues that the big winner is Tsvangirai himself , because Mujuru 's case to be leader of the opposition coalition has been substantially weakened . In fact , the MDC-T may no longer feel the need to include any elements of ZimPF . They no longer have to work with any devils .
“ It 's a blessing in disguise that there has been this rupture . Otherwise the coalition would have included characters who had an insincere interest in building a solid coalition against Zanu-PF . It also means we do n't have too many problems now about who should lead the coalition . In the past it appeared that Mujuru was a contender for leadership , but it 's becoming clear after the shenanigans in her party , as well as a very heavy defeat in the recent by-election , that there remains only one person with solid support . If there 's going to be a coalition , then it 's going to be built around the MDC led by Morgan Tsvangirai , ” said Magaisa . – Daily Marverick
Netflix whiffed today in its first-quarter earnings when it came to subscriber growth , missing the expectations it set at the beginning of the year for the first quarter .
Still , Netflix said it is expecting to add 600,000 domestic subscribers and 2.6 million international subscribers in the second quarter . That would bring it over the hump to get it past that 100 million mark that — again — may be some kind of signal of faith for the company as it looks to continue growing internationally amid heavy spend on content . The subscriber numbers are more or less the key part of Netflix 's business because it 'll determine whether or not it can level off the spend on content to grow and keep users around against the revenue it generates from those subscribers .
Getting that growth up is going to be even more important given the amount of money Netflix has to invest to get those subscribers to stick around and gather new ones . In addition to the costs of producing original content , Netflix also said it would spend $ 1 billion in marketing this year .
“ As part of this , we are investing more in programmatic advertising with the aim of improving our ability to do individualized marketing at scale and to deliver the right ad to the right person at the right time , ” the company said in the earnings release .
In the end , shares of Netflix fell around 3 % following the report , but it could have been quite a bit worse . Netflix can be prone to major swings in its stock price based on the subscriber numbers it delivers every quarter . The last one looked good , so they saw a pretty hefty stock jump . Netflix reported earnings of 40 cents per share on revenue of $ 2.64 billion . Analysts were also expecting earnings of 37 cents per share on revenue of $ 2.64 billion . Near-term , things might not have looked that great , but the better-than-expected guidance seems enough to buoy enough major suspicions about its future potential .
The company added 1.42 million domestic subscribers and 3.53 million international subscribers . Netflix itself projected that it would add 5.2 million subscribers in the first quarter — 1.5 million in the U.S. and 3.7 million internationally . That estimate would have brought Netflix to 99 million subscribers , tantalizingly close to a nice round number that may or may not impress investors going forward .
In January , Netflix reported domestic subscriber growth that was much stronger than what Wall Street was expecting , which ended up sending the stock price soaring . It was a pleasant surprise — and maybe a relief — given that a lot of the focus and attention was given to its international expansion after it decided to open up to a wide array of new countries . International growth , too , beat expectations , with the company adding 5 million new subscribers .
In the past year , Netflix has seen a steady climb up as it looks like its expansion plans are n't running into its major issues , though it has a lot of big markets that it has to get into . It also has to invest heavily in original content for those new markets , given that it ca n't just rely fully on its existing library and the content that does well in its domestic markets . Last quarter , Hastings pointed to a new show called The 3 % that was launched in Brazil and was highly successful .
Netflix 's report today kicks off the first quarter of the tech earnings season . Following a string of successful IPOs through the first quarter , we 'll see how industry observers will be reacting to what the rest of the tech world is delivering .

NEW YORK ( AP ) -- A Trump-affiliated firm under scrutiny for inappropriately obtaining data on tens of millions of Facebook users created profiling algorithms that `` took fake news to the next level , '' a former employee said .
Chris Wylie said the firm , Cambridge Analytica , secured personal data in order to learn about individuals and then used it to create an information cocoon to change their perceptions .
`` This is based on an idea called 'informational dominance , ' which is the idea that if you can capture every channel of information around a person and then inject content around them , you can change their perception of what 's actually happening , '' Wylie said .
In an interview Monday on NBC 's `` Today , '' Wylie said Cambridge Analytica aimed to `` explore mental vulnerabilities of people . '' He said the firm `` works on creating a web of disinformation online so people start going down the rabbit hole of clicking on blogs , websites etc . that make them think things are happening that may not be . ''
This idea of `` information dominance , '' of propaganda , Wylie told The Guardian newspaper earlier , is the notion that if you can control all of the streams of information to your opponents , `` you can influence how they perceive that battle space and you can then influence how they 're going to behave and react . ''
Late Friday , Facebook said it would ban Cambridge Analytica , saying the company improperly obtained information from 270,000 people who downloaded a purported research app described as a personality test . Facebook first learned of the breach more than two years ago , but has n't disclosed it until now .
The developments are the latest to show how people try to exploit Facebook in ways that could sway elections , and in the worst cases even undermine democracy . Before the Cambridge imbroglio , there were Russian agents running election-related propaganda campaigns through targeted ads and fake political events .
Wylie claimed Cambridge Analytica used the data it had while speaking with Russian businesses . He also said that while political ads are also targeted at specific voters , what 's different here is that people would n't know they were getting messages aimed at influencing their views .
Cambridge Analytica has denied wrongdoing and said it deleted all data it received from a contractor after learning the data had been obtained in violation of Facebook policies . The firm said none of that data was used in its 2016 election work for the `` avoidance of doubt . '' President Donald Trump 's campaign Saturday denied using the firm 's data , saying it relied on the Republican National Committee for its data .
Wylie left Cambridge Analytica in 2014 , and it 's not clear how the firm targeted people with misinformation during the 2016 presidential campaign . What is clear is that two-thirds of Americans get at least some of their news on social media , according to Pew Research Center , and about 20 percent do so `` often . '' While people do n't exist in a Facebook-only vacuum , it is possible that bogus information users saw on the site could later be reinforced by the `` rabbit hole '' of clicks and conspiracy sites on the broader internet , as Wylie described .
While Wylie said he does n't know whether Trump 's campaign used the techniques , he said Trump 's former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski was meeting with Cambridge Analytica in 2015 , before Trump even announced his run for office .
HTC will design and release a mobile VR solution this year .
HTC is n't selling as many phones as it used to , and is now referring to itself as a `` VR company , '' much to the delight of its shareholders .
The company has informed CNET UK that is working on a mobile version of the HTC Vive , though the design and functionality is not yet clear . What is clear is that `` it 's not a phone slapped onto a headset . It 'd be a different thing , '' according to CFO Chia-lin Chang .
The Vive , while great , requires a very powerful PC and a rat 's nest of wires to function properly , while solutions like Google Daydream and Samsung Gear VR merely require a compatible smartphone . They 're not as powerful , obviously , but you can take it with you .
HTC promises something in the middle , perhaps a bit more standalone , and slightly more powerful , than Google 's and Samsung 's approaches , but more portable than a Vive . According to HTC , the solution will be compatible with its new HTC U Ultra flagship , and will be released before the end of 2017 .
LONDON - Ben Stokes will not travel with the England squad to Australia on October 28 but no final decision has been taken on his involvement in the Ashes , cricket chiefs said Friday .
Test vice-captain Stokes , 26 , was arrested last month on suspicion of causing actual bodily harm and suspended , along with Alex Hales , from internationals until further notice following an apparent fight outside a nightclub .
The powerful all-rounder , who was released without charge but remains under investigation , was included in the Ashes squad despite reportedly injuring his hand in the incident that led to his arrest .
The England and Wales Cricket Board on Friday further announced that Stokes , who is also subject to internal disciplinary action , had been awarded central contracts for Test and limited-overs cricket . Hales , 28 , has been retained as a limited-overs specialist .
But the ECB said in light of the ongoing police investigation , Middlesex paceman Steven Finn would be added to the Ashes touring squad . `` With the Ashes just around the corner , it 's important to give the players , the coaching staff and supporters some clarity around a complex situation , '' said Director of England Cricket Andrew Strauss .
`` This decision will help us in the weeks ahead and give every player and the whole England set-up the best chance to focus on the challenge ahead in Australia . `` Steven is a high-quality cricketer , with considerable experience of both international cricket and Australian conditions . The selectors believe he will add to the range of options and the squad will be further supported by the arrival of the Lions in Australia in November . ''
`` We have spoken to Ben and assured him that our decision in no way prejudges the outcome of the ongoing police investigation or cricket discipline commission process , as can be seen by the award of central contracts , '' Strauss added .
In a separate matter , the ECB has also fined and issued a formal written warning to Jonny Bairstow , Jake Ball and Liam Plunkett following a disciplinary investigation into behaviour during the recent one-day series against the West Indies . No further details have been given but the ECB has stated clearly that this issue is `` unrelated to the investigations into Ben Stokes and Alex Hales '' .
The absence of Stokes from the the tour of Australia would be a huge blow for Ashes holders England , who have lost two out of their past three tours Down Under 5-0 and are desperate to hit the ground running in Brisbane on November 23 .
England enjoyed a good summer at home , with Test series wins against South Africa and the West Indies , but there are doubts about a number of positions at the top of the batting order . Stokes , who bats left-handed , is an explosive middle-order batsman with six Test hundreds under his belt and a dangerous right-arm fast medium bowler .

Rolls-Royce is embracing its dark side . The British automaker is on a quest to expand its bespoke offerings , and the Black Badge cars are part of this journey . Now there are a handful of new members in the group and you can refer to them as the Adamas Collection .
There will be 40 Wraiths and 30 Dawns that receive the Adamas treatment . What that entails is a whole lot of darkness , and the results are stunning . Right away you 'll find a Spirit of Ecstasy that 's not the shining example of luxury you expect to find . Instead , the lovely lady has been machined from carbon fiber . This is the first time that Rolls has ever crafted its iconic leading woman in the light yet strong material . She 's comprised of 294 layers of aerospace grade carbon fiber and it takes 68 hours for her form to take shape .
The main tone is black for the exterior skin as well , but the cars are finished with either an Aphrodite Red or Morpheus Blue contrasting hue . Once you step into the cabin , the darkness continues to envelop the soul of this Goodwood-built machine . Rolls-Royce has utilized laboratory diamonds to coddle the Black Badge infinity symbol inside the car . Overhead you 'll find 1,340 fiberoptic lights to create another diamond pattern . For the first time , the overhead lamps use graded intensity that shades or highlights the pattern presented overhead .
A final luxurious touch occurs when one enters or exits the car . An illuminated sill plate reminds the owner that their vehicle is one of 30 or 40 , depending on which model they 've chosen .
As more and more premium and luxury features filter down to vehicles within the means of the proletariat , it 's up to Rolls-Royce to continually push the true luxury bar ever higher . The Adamas Collection cars do that , and they do so with a delightfully sinister air .

SZA returned to the TDE Championship Tour at New York 's Madison Square Garden Tuesday night after taking several dates off to recover from swollen vocal chords , but apparently the performance made her condition worse . In a series of since-deleted tweets after her set , she claimed that her “ voice is permanently injured . ”
“ Tonight was the test . That settles that , ” she wrote in a series of posts archived by Vulture . “ I jus wan na be left alone my priorities are f—ed up . They have been f—ed up . I need space goodbye . ”
“ For anyone who has n't seen this . I 've been touring for 11 months . This did n't happen overnight , ” she continued . “ I 've been troubleshooting for a while now and Usually steroids and pushing through help . They do n't have this time . I 'm not sick my voice just wo n't f—ing work . If I do n't pause now I 'll be forced to pause permanently . I 'm genuinely sorry for every face , voice , and energy field I wo n't be touching ! I 'm literally taking as many steroids as I can to speed this up ! ! Its a waiting game and super weird to be blamed for stuff outta my control but I get it ! again .. I 'm sorry .. I 'll be right back . Pray for me or do n't . Preciate u either way . ”
The tour , which is headlined by Kendrick Lamar , caps off a solid year-plus of hard work for SZA , whose RCA debut dropped on June 9 of last year and has since seen nearly non-stop touring and promotional work , including performances at the Grammy Awards — where she was nominated for five awards but surprisingly did not win any — and the Coachella festival last month .
A rep for SZA did not immediately reply to Variety 's request for comment .
`` It 's not just getting people introduced to the game , '' he says . `` It 's keeping them in the game . ''
Canada is fertile ground for Golftec 's data-based approach .
On a per-capita basis , some 21 per cent of Canadians have at least a passing interest in golf — second only to New Zealand , and roughly twice that of the United States . And yet when it comes to successful pro players , Canada pales in comparison to smaller places like Sweden and Australia .
`` We 're golf crazy . The unfortunate thing is we 're not necessarily very good , '' Suttie says . `` That is one of the things that I think we really could do a lot better at : getting the country better from a golfing standpoint . ''
After just seven years in Canada , Golftec represents a whopping 19.5 per cent of all the private lessons taught in Canada , he says . That percentage is just under 26 per cent in the U.S. , where Golftec has been in operation since 1995 .
`` So we 're very quickly catching up to the penetration that the U.S. has , '' Suttie says .
`` We have a large percentage of very avid golfers , but we 're frankly not as good as the Americans are in golf , which is not a surprise because of the money that 's been spent there teaching . ''
Golfers themselves are n't the only ones reaping the benefits . For teaching professionals , high-tech tools can make traditional outdoor range instruction seem like working with a blindfold on .
`` It 's huge , '' says Druken , who like all Golftec instructors underwent a comprehensive training course at the U.S. parent company 's Denver headquarters .
Where traditional instruction has often struggled to help students understand the differences between `` feel '' and `` real , '' the scientific , numbers-oriented approach all but eliminates the uncertainty that can undermine progress , he preaches .
`` It 's one thing to have theory about what you think the student should do , but to be able to measure gives you clear direction , and allows the student to buy into the process with trust , '' Druken says .
`` For a novice coach , the training they receive and the tools at their disposal allow them to have direction , even when they may not know how to act from previous experience . ''
To prove his point , Druken quickly diagnoses a visitor 's long-standing frustrations with swing plane , spotting a shoulder tilt that 's not where it should be . The Golftec system shows a yellow or red number — not good .
He activates an electronic tone that will only sound once the shoulder plane is in the green zone . A couple of false starts , then suddenly — beep ! — a picture-perfect position at the top of the swing that looks yanked from the pages of Golf Digest .
`` We 're a numbers-driven society , '' says Suttie . `` Once you start to understand the numbers , it makes it a lot easier to be able to communicate effectively , so you 're working on the right things . ''
The indoor element makes a difference , too . Working on a swing change in the middle of the golf season borders on the impossible for all but the most dedicated players , since it often means a difficult period of adjustment at the most inopportune time .
Building a new swing in the dead of winter , on the other hand ? What else were you planning to do besides shovel the driveway , scrape the ice off the windshield and maybe brave the mall for a relaxing bit of Christmas shopping ?
`` That is a great way of practicing , as opposed to going to the driving range and pounding balls for an hour , which is what I used to do all the time , '' says Suttie .
`` It never got me better . ''

The slimmer Equinox feels more dynamic than the previous model , McCormick says . ( Photo : Chevrolet )
Many people go to Nashville to listen to music , but if you are really lucky , you go to make music . Chevrolet made the latter happen for this guitar-playing auto writer and made a test drive of the new 2018 Equinox part of the bargain .
This Nashville trip coincided with the Country Music Awards , which Chevy sponsors as part of its long and deep association with music of all kinds . Consider that the first car to have a radio installed was a 1933 Chevy and that the brand is mentioned in more than 1,000 songs .
Our hotel was awash with celebrity bands — Earth , Wind & Fire , U2 to name just two — but we were focused on the Equinox , as we headed out for a drive on Tennessee 's bucolic back roads .
As Chevy 's second-best selling vehicle after the Silverado , the Equinox has sold more than 2 million units since its launch in 2005 . Given the competitiveness of the booming compact-crossover segment , Chevy has executed a thorough redesign and engineering makeover for the 2018 Equinox .
Like other new models in the Chevrolet lineup , the Equinox has been on a diet , losing 400 pounds and five inches in overall length . These moves translate into a vehicle that immediately feels more dynamic and responsive than the previous generation Equinox .
The all-new body structure is much stiffer , which means the suspension has been tuned to provide tauter steering , less body-roll and a more agile feel through twists and turns .
Aside from the body redesign , the other big news for the 2018 Equinox is its engine lineup , which now adds GM 's first application of a 2-liter turbo four-cylinder , paired with a new nine-speed automatic . With 252 horsepower on tap , the latest powertrain combination provides a welcome boost over the 170-horse base 1.5-liter turbo . Diesel engine fans will be interested to know that a 1.6-liter turbo-diesel motor will be offered later this year .
The Equinox continues to offer all-wheel drive as an option but the system is now switchable , so fuel economy is improved when the driver disengages it .
Inside , the 2018 Equinox is dressed up with a new design , materials and driver-assistance features . The overall look and feel is best expressed in the Premier version , which sports contrasting leather trim to break up the standard sea-of-black-plastic dashboard . Front seats come with surprisingly firm side-bolsters , which are great when cornering , but may be a tad tight for larger occupants .
Pricing starts in the mid- $ 20s but quickly ramps up to the low- $ 40s for a well-equipped Premier AWD model .
Compared to the best of the competition in the segment , especially the Mazda CX-5 , the Equinox has significantly raised its game , with a combination of new 2-liter powertrain , more responsive driving character and practical crossover features .
Our Equinox drive route concluded outside Nashville at Castle Studios , a famous recording facility that has hosted a who 's who of musicians , from Bob Dylan to Brad Paisley to Snoop Dogg . Frank Rogers , a renowned music-industry producer , was on hand to introduce me and five other auto writers and amateur musicians to the intricacies of professional-level studio recording .
A few hours later we emerged , having recorded a couple of songs and gained huge respect for the challenges involved in producing high-quality music .
Just like the car business , the technology and skills involved in the recording industry are impressive and daunting . Suffice to say , this auto writer had a blast in the studio , but I wo n't be giving up my day job any time soon .

Throughout the summer ahead of training camp , we 'll count down the top-25 Patriots players based on production at their position , physical attributes , upside and expected impact during the 2018 regular season .
Bill Belichick bucked the trend he 's created since taking over as the New England Patriots coach . He drafted a skill player in the first round of the draft . Sony Michel was the Patriots ' pick at No . 31 .
Laurence Maroney , the only other skill player Belichick has drafted in the first round , got almost 200 touches in his rookie season . Even when ignoring that historical context , Michel figures to be in line for a significant workload . The Patriots saw the Titans sign Dion Lewis , who finished the 2017 season as the Patriots ' workhorse . James White and Rex Burkhead were complementary backs in the prolific Patriots offense ( which meant that they certainly were n't afterthoughts ) . With Lewis gone and Mike Gillislee looking like a flop , Michel will have a good shot at taking over the lead back role for the Patriots .
If he can win that job , Michel would be in line for at least 200 touches as a runner as receiver . Mitchel was n't prolific as a receiver in college , but the Patriots must project him to the passing game after drafting him so high . Michel 's productivity in the running game is anything but a projection . He finished his senior season averaging an absurd 7.9 yards per carry . He had 1,227 yards and 16 touchdowns in 2017 .
In the college football playoffs , Michel was a monster . He finished the semifinal against Oklahoma with 11 carries for 181 yards and three touchdowns with four receptions for 41 yards and a touchdown . He added 14 carries for 98 rushing yards ( 7.0 ypc ) in the national championship against an Alabama team which allowed 2.72 yards per carry .
He 's ready to be an every-down back in the NFL , in large part due to his abilities as a pass-protector . In an offense when Tom Brady is far-and-away the most important player , Michel 's ability to block will be paramount .
“ We think he 's a good football player so we picked the player , ” Patriots director of personnel Nick Caserio said after drafting Michel . “ He 's got pretty good skills . He 's athletic . He 's good in space . He 's a strong runner for his size . ”
The biggest issue with Michel is fumbling . If the Patriots think they have the fix to his ball-security issues , then he 'll fit seamlessly into the offense , and be an immediate contributor .
Oregon lawmakers heard public testimony Monday on a set of bills to regulate guns , and a technical mistake nearly kept the bills from moving forward .
One bill would prohibit people who have a standing restraining order filed by their boyfriend or girlfriend from owning firearms . Currently , that law only applies to people who 've lived together .
Multnomah County Sheriff Mike Reese testified in favor of the measure .
`` Simply put , keeping guns out of the hands of abusers is the best way to prevent them from shooting and killing their victims , '' he said .
The measure would also delay a gun sale indefinitely if a person fails a background check . Another bill would require people at risk for suicide to turn over their weapons if their family members successfully seek a court order . And another bill would require people to attend a live fire training course before getting a concealed handgun license .
Jim Mitchell was one of many opponents who said the bills would penalize lawful gun owners .
`` These are bills that are aimed at preventing the ownership of firearms . And that 's about all you can say for them , '' said Mitchell .
The Senate Judiciary Committee did not immediately act on the measures .
Technically , the bills are all dead because the committee 's chair , Sen. Floyd Prozanski , D-Eugene , did not carry over the measures to Tuesday 's meeting . Policy bills are dead if not acted on by the end of the day Tuesday .
But the lack of action appears to be due to an oversight , rather than a lack of political support .
Much of the contents of the measures heard Monday will be introduced as an amendment to another bill being heard Tuesday , in a procedural move known around the state capitol as a `` gut-and-stuff . ''

( Montego Bay , Jamaica ) — Sandals Resorts International has 22 hotels in 8 different territories throughout the Caribbean and in 35 years of doing business with numerous governments , we have always operated at the highest standards and in the most ethical and transparent manner .
As an upstanding and conscientious corporate citizen , we have always sought to work in harmony with the various stakeholders . Therefore , we are appalled at the unwarranted and vicious attack that has been launched against the company and its Chairman by Prime Minister Gaston Browne and his government after plans to upgrade the resort in Antigua and Barbuda were revealed — news that should have been cause for celebration for any investor-savvy administration as it will be beneficial to both the country and the resort staff and their families .
Sandals is no stranger to Antigua and Barbuda nor its people . We planted our flag here over a quarter of a century ago when we took over a floundering 99-room hotel ( the Anchorage ) , and over the years transformed it into a world-class , five-star resort and conference centre , and the flagship of Antigua . Today , Sandals Grande Antigua is proud to boast 373 luxurious and state-of-the-art rooms and suites .
For 25 consecutive years , we delivered the industry 's highest occupancies while remaining open for business without any closure . During this time , we have grown , expanded and deepened our economic contribution even while many other resorts or hotels have either fallen by the wayside or closed for long periods during the off-season .
We would , therefore , like to set a few things straight .
Sandals and the government of Antigua and Barbuda ( under Prime Minister Lester Bird 's administration ) signed a Memorandum of Understanding in March 2000 , which granted to Sandal relief from the Hotel Tax and Guest Levy in exchange for constructing 100 new rooms . Not only did Sandal keep its word to the people of Antigua and Barbuda , we exceeded our obligations by almost doubling the number of rooms and suites ( 180 ) at significant additional investment . This included adding tremendous facilities , such as a brand-new conference centre and restaurants to the resort . In doing so , we also created employment for 120 additional staff with some of the highest compensation packages . The fact is the Hotel Tax and Guest Levy was replaced by the Antigua and Barbuda Sales Tax in September of 2006 . Therefore , in January 2009 , the then government , with the sole purpose of ensuring that Sandals as the most significant investor on the island was not to be prejudiced by the introduction of the ABST , granted Sandals compensatory relief from a portion of the ABST so as to maintain the value of the original concession benefits . Since then , Sandals has continued to fulfil its tax obligations in a timely manner and as a responsible stakeholder in Antigua and Barbuda .
During 2016 , the Gaston Browne administration , in clear breach of a proper and legally-binding agreement , made several unfounded accusations against Sandals regarding the ABST and abolished the 2009 agreement . Although this action was illegal , Sandals in the interest of maintaining its harmonious working relationship with the people of Antigua and Barbuda , nevertheless worked with the government to formalize an agreement of understanding between both parties , giving up significant concessions to which we were entitled and at significant cost to the company .
We would like to state categorically that at the time it was our understanding that these concessions were in keeping with normal encouragement concessions of that period . It is also our understanding that at this present time there have been concessions given elsewhere that far exceed anything Sandals has ever seen .
Yet , in spite of this ratified agreement , the Prime Minister and his government continue to make defamatory statements and cast serious aspersions against the company , including that some attempt was made to unfairly influence him , which has resulted in reputational damage to the company , the brand and our many loyal team members .
Sandals , therefore , also reserves the right to initiate all legal options , including suing for slander and libel to protect its good name . However , our main concern is the impact this is having on our 700 team members and their families , 95 % of whom are indigenous , that is , from Antigua and Barbuda and the OECS , and many of whom have been a part of the Sandals family since inception .
A key reason why Sandals has been named World 's Best Luxury Included Hotel for the past 23 consecutive years is the passion and commitment of our team members , an attitude for success honed by the very best training , and an appetite to be the best that is the hallmark of the Sandals family .
Our team members are the ones who make Sandals what it is and any attack on our company can also be seen as an attack on them . It demonstrates a level of contempt for the hardworking Antiguans and Barbudans whose great efforts have helped make Sandals one of the world 's exceptional hotel organizations . Our team members are not only among the highest-paid in the industry , but have full access to medical and pension plans . We take care of our own and do not need anyone to make insincere gestures of concern .
If the Prime Minister and his government are indeed genuinely concerned about the people working here in Antigua , then cease the unnecessary threats , posturing and false accusations and let 's work together to ensure that the maintenance work , which we have agreed to reduce from five months to three months , takes place as quickly and with as little disruption as possible .
Sandals never has , and never will , be intimidated . It is not in the nature of our company , nor the nearly 15,000 proud team members who make up the Sandals family in Antigua and Barbuda and globally , and who continue to make our company the most-sought-after product on the planet . Indeed , it will not be long before a number of new countries soon welcome the Sandals brand as well .
Summerville Police say a man who was wounded while reportedly breaking into an apartment Sunday will face a burglary charge .
David Rutledge was expected to be charged with first-degree burglary in connection with an incident at Waters Edge Apartments , an incident report states .
Summerville Police responded Sunday morning at approximately 9:15 a.m. to a reported break-in that ended in a shooting .
When police arrived , the resident of the apartment met them at the front of the building and was placed in handcuffs , patted down for weapons and read his Miranda Rights , the report states . The man told police he was lying in bed when he heard someone banging on the front door . The man asked his girlfriend who it was and she said it was Rutledge , her ex-boyfriend , the report states .
The resident told officers he then heard the door get kicked in and said Rutledge came after him in the bedroom . The resident said he grabbed his girlfriend 's gun , which he said was kept by the bed next to them , and shot Rutledge once in the arm .
The report states Rutledge reportedly continued charging at the man and landed on top of him in the bed . The two began fighting for a time until the man choked Rutledge until he stopped fighting , the report states .
After the fight , the man said Rutledge then walked back into the living room and sat down .
The resident had abrasions on the side of his head , a bruise on his chest , a cut on his right knee and his toenail was bent back as a result of the injury , the report states .
Police say Rutledge had two dogs in his pickup truck at the time of the incident . While officers waited for someone to come and pick up the dogs , officers went to the truck to check on them and found a loaded shotgun in the truck 's front seat .
Rutledge was transported to a hospital for treatment . The incident report states officers were drawing up a warrant for first-degree burglary against Rutledge and planned to serve him with the warrant Monday .
The resident of the apartment was released at the scene .
Rutledge was being held pending a bond hearing , but the time of the bond hearing was not immediately known .

Google Now Launcher , eat your heart out .
Nova Launcher is one of the best third-party launchers in the Android ecosystem because it will let you do just about everything you ever thought possible with your home screens and app drawer . One of the most sought-after features Nova Launcher has not been able to deliver to users has been the Google Now pane that the eponymous Google Now Launcher spoiled millions with during its tenure on Android . Well , Google Now Launcher is sailing into the sunset , and in its wake , Google has made some changes that have finally , finally allowed Nova Launcher to offer the Google Now pane on the left side of its screen .
... There are just a few hoops we all have to jump through for it .
When Google announced that it was removing Google Now Launcher from the market , it also announced that it was releasing an API that would allow Android phone manufacturers to utilize Google Now panes in their own launchers . This API could also work with third-party launchers , but they could n't be published on Google Play because of the exact conditions the API and the Play Store require . We can only hope that changes going forward , but for now , that means that only launchers that are willing to go outside the Play Store can take advantage of one of the most desired launcher features .
Nova Launcher has never shied away from a challenge , and so it has released a companion app called Nova Google Companion that will let you bring that Google Now pane to your home screen . Want to try Google Now on Nova Launcher ? Here 's everything you need :
An Android phone running Android 6.0 or above
Update to the latest Nova Launcher Beta
Install and open the Nova Google Companion app
Turn off Infinity Scroll in Nova Settings > Desktop > Scroll
The pane was slightly wonky before I restarted Nova , but things have been smooth since . This is the first stab at Google Now for Nova Launcher and rest assured that any bugs and glitches will be worked through , but it 's here , and for the most part , it works .
Will Google update its terms to allow Nova and other launchers to bring Google Now panes to its Play Store apps instead of going around Google ? How quickly will this come to other launchers , or will the hoops turn off other developers from investing the time and effort ? Only time will tell , but for now , Nova can check a big line off their request list .

Michael Rafferty , DEGC vice president of small business services , said the improvements funded through the program should create more inviting and stable commercial districts throughout the city .

Glen Long , interim president and CEO of DEGC , said his organization has a long collaboration history with the mayor 's office and other private and nonprofit organizations that have been building a network of support for small business .
“ We recognize how successful small businesses are significant job creators and strong contributors to the quality of life in neighborhoods , ” Long said .
Motor City Re-Store is supported by a combination of Community Development Block Grant funds and other sources . The Economic Development Corp. has stewardship of the public funds and has approved funding to develop the program . It voted on final program operational plans on Tuesday .

Fifty-three years after being set up as a development finance institution and 13 years after its rebirth as a bank , IDBI Bank Ltd today is a shadow of the important institution it once was . Bereft of capital to lend and facing a fast decaying loan book , the public sector lender is making losses hand over fist .
In its first quarter after having pulled into prompt corrective action by the Reserve Bank of India ( RBI ) , IDBI Bank 's loan book showed no signs of healing . In fact , it only got worse .
Gross bad loan stock rose 12 % sequentially and the ratio bloated to nearly 25 % , the highest among banks .
Its loan book shrank 14 % but the lender has hardly been able to bring down its exposure to large corporate borrowers . Its operating profit is down a massive 40 % from a year ago .
On 9 May , RBI had invoked prompt corrective action under which a bunch of banks is asked to follow a pattern of regulatory restrictions to get their houses in order . IDBI Bank qualified as a lender in dire straits as it had breached threshold levels in two out of four parameters the regulator had listed .
The lender 's March quarter results had shown that its loan book was rapidly turning bad and its capital was eroding at a faster pace . The common equity Tier-I capital ratio dropped below the regulatory minimum .
Three months on , the public sector lender 's metrics have only worsened . One rupee out of every four it lent has turned bad and its provisions do not give any comfort either . Provision coverage ratio is just 52 % as of 30 June .
Fresh slippages fell to Rs7,659 crore from a massive Rs11,531 crore in the previous quarter but were higher from a year ago . The lender still has an exposure of Rs19,000 crore or 10 % of its loan book to 11 out of the 12 corporate borrowers RBI had asked banks to refer under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code .
In the meanwhile , the focus seems to be towards beefing up capital . IDBI Bank got a capital infusion of Rs394 crore from Life Insurance Corporation of India through a preferential allotment of shares and also sold the stake it held in Clearing Corp. of India Ltd ( CCIL ) . The government infused Rs1,861 crore into the bank in the current quarter . After all this , the lender 's common equity Tier-I stands at 6.49 % , up from 5.64 % in March . The bank will offload more of its stake in CCIL and in Small Industries Development Bank of India in the coming months , it said .
The IDBI Bank stock has lost a massive 36 % since coming under RBI 's corrective plan , which indicates that investors are pessimistic about the lender 's performance . It now trades at 0.46 times its estimated price-to-book value for fiscal year 2018 . There 's little chance of any change in the outlook in the foreseeable future .

Announcing the Juror Award Winners for 36th Annual KVIE Art Auction
TORONTO -
Ontario Premier Kathleen Wynne sued the Opposition leader for defamation Monday , less than six months away from the June provincial election .
The legal action stems from comments Progressive Conservative Leader Patrick Brown made in September , a day before Wynne testified as a witness at a trial in Sudbury , Ont. , involving two provincial Liberals facing Election Act bribery charges .
Brown told reporters he hoped Wynne would give answers about the scandal “ maybe when she stands trial ” and went on to describe her as a “ sitting premier , sitting in trial . ”
The premier was not on trial and had waived parliamentary privilege in order to testify as a witness .
The Tory leader refused to apologize for the statements both after an initial letter from Wynne 's lawyer and following a libel notice in October , saying he would “ ignore her baseless legal threat. ” His lawyer has said the statements were not defamatory .
Wynne 's legal team filed a statement of claim in court Monday that seeks $ 100,000 in general , aggravated , exemplary and punitive damages . Brown 's statements harmed Wynne 's reputation , they wrote .
“ The deliberate , malicious conduct of the defendant in publishing the defamatory statements is part of an ongoing campaign engineered by the defendant and others to harm the plaintiff 's reputation , ” Wynne 's lawyers wrote .
“ The defendant 's egregious misconduct in publishing statements that he knew to be false , his ongoing refusal to retract these false statements , and his high-handed and oppressive conduct in stating to media and directly to the world at large that the plaintiff 's complaints were baseless and would be ignored , all justify an award of aggravated , exemplary and punitive damages against the defendant . ”
Wynne 's spokeswoman said the statement of claim was filed to preserve the premier 's ability to continue with the legal case .
“ We continue to remain hopeful that this issue can be resolved with an apology from Patrick Brown for his defamatory remarks , ” Jenn Beaudry wrote . “ It should be that simple . However , if he continues to refuse to apologize we will have the ability to continue legal action . ”
Brown has not yet filed a statement of defence .
Progressive Conservative Bill Walker also made remarks in September suggesting the premier was under investigation and facing charges in connection with the Sudbury bribery trial . He apologized hours after receiving a letter from Wynne 's lawyers .
“ Mr . Walker 's apology and retraction were widely reported in the media and there can be no doubt that the situation was extensively discussed by ( Brown ) and his staff , ” Wynne 's lawyers wrote .
“ As a result , the defendant was fully aware that the Walker statements were false , and that Mr. Walker had retracted them and issued a public apology . ”
The two Liberals on trial in Sudbury were ultimately acquitted .
Wynne previously sued the former Progressive Conservative leader , Tim Hudak , and another Tory member of provincial parliament after the pair said she oversaw — and possibly ordered — the destruction of documents related to two cancelled gas plants . Those are allegations for which two McGuinty-era staffers are on trial and awaiting a judge 's decision .
That lawsuit was resolved in 2015 , though it is not known whether it was settled or withdrawn .
After 13 years of frustration , decision-making power over the future of council-owned land at Matiatia has been handed to Waiheke Local Board .
The “ delegation ” of authority , approved by Auckland Council last week , represents a significant step towards making better sense of the island gateway and improving carparking and people-flows – though big physical changes are still several years away and subject to council funding . • Geoff Cumming

The students at Ripley Middle School participated in National Black History Month during February .
“ We are very proud of some of the essay 's our students wrote this year for Black History Month , ” said Chris Smith , principal at the Middle School in Aberdeen . “ These kids live in an area where there is so much history on slavery , the Underground Railroad , Parker House and more .
“ Our students ' recognition of black history this year has been phenomenal . ”
Many of the students wrote essay 's on African Americans who achieved great things in their lives , changing the United States forever .
Bailey Davis ( 6th grade ) wrote the following essay on Harriet Tubman , whom she refers to as an American Hero…
….Harriet Tubman is an American hero . Harriet was brave , she traveled 90 miles alone in the woods with people searching after her .
She was sneaky she kept going back into slave territory . Harriet was also fearless went back for anyone that wanted to escape . She was proud , she saved over 900 slaves . She would do anything to help her family . She was selfless she risked her life for everyone else 's freedom .
Ciara Covert , ( 5th grade ) wrote her essay on Dorothy Vaughan…
….Dorothy Vaughan was born on September 20 , 1910 in Kansas City . She went to college at Wilberforce University in 1929 .
Dorothy was played the role of Octavia Spencer in the movie “ Hidden Figures ”
She was hired from NASA ( National Aeronautics and Space Administration ) in 1943 and was retired in 1971 . In an era when NASA is led by an African American man ( Administrator Charles Bolden ) and a woman ( Deputy Administrator Dava Newman ) and when recent NASA Center Directors come from a variety of backgrounds , it 's easy to overlook the people who paved the way for the agency 's current robust and diverse workforce and leadership .
Those who speak of NASA 's pioneers rarely mention the name Dorothy Vaughan , but as the head of the National Advisory Committee for Aeronatic ( NACA 's ) segregated West Area Computing Unit form 1949 until 1958 , Vaughan was both a respected mathematician and NASA 's first African-American manager .
Congratulation to both Covert and Bailey for their well-written , informative essay 's on black history .

Indian-origin Liverpool playmaker wanted by former European champions
The 18-year-old is likely to join a Championship club ahead of the deadline day .
@ blowmeoffaridge by Abhijit Bharali Transfers 14 Aug 2017 , 12:03 IST
Dhanda scored against Swansea City in the Premier League 2 on Friday
Former European Cup champions Nottingham Forest are among a host of clubs fighting for the signature of the Indian-origin playmaker at Liverpool , Yan Dhanda .
Along with Forest , who are now managed by former Brentford and Rangers boss Mark Warburton , former English champions Leeds United and Bristol City are also in the race to sign the 18-year-old on loan .
Dhanda has been an impressive performer for Liverpool ever since he joined the Reds from West Bromwich Albion in 2013 . The starlet , who is eligible to represent India in international football due to his Indian roots , has played for England U-17s in the past . His primary position on the pitch is just off the striker but Dhanda can also play across the frontline .
Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp alluded to his Indian roots while inviting Dhanda to train with the first team last season , saying : `` Probably we are the only club with an Indian player in the squad . Yan Dhanda is a very good player and hopefully , he can come through . ''
While Dhanda is highly-rated at the Merseyside club , a failure to cement a squad place for the 2017-18 Premier League season might see the youngster being farmed out to the second tier . Forest have made a fine start to their 2017-18 Championship campaign by notching two wins in two games . Whether they can seal the loan deal for Dhanda before deadline day remains to be seen .
Dhanda has only 12 months remaining on his Anfield contract hence sending him out on loan at this juncture could be a risky move for Liverpool if the player ends up impressing in the Championship . Last season , he played 24 games for Liverpool U18s , who are currently managed by club legend Steven Gerrard , and scored and assisted a total of 14 goals .
The Birmingham-born lad is currently with Liverpool 's U23s for the 2017-18 season . Dhanda scored the clinching goal in Liverpool 's 2-0 win over Swansea City in their Premier League 2 opener on Friday .
August 31st is the deadline day for the summer transfer window in England . Dhanda , with his performances for Liverpool U23s , has certainly caught the eye of top Championship clubs which could only be a good thing for the player as well as his big contingent of Indian supporters .

UNITED NATIONS , Oct 6 ( APP ) : A top Pakistani diplomat has told the
United Nations that Pakistan has “ turned the tide ” against terrorism through a series of determined actions that led to the destruction of terrorist infrastructures and bases in its tribal areas and along the Pak-Afghan border region .
“ Terrorism in Pakistan is an unfortunate by product of the political and
geo-strategic developments and foreign interventions in our neighborhood over the past 40 years , ” Ambassador Maleeha Lodhi , Pakistan 's permanent representative to the U.N. , told the UN General Assembly 's Sixth Committee , which deals with legal matters .
Speaking in a debate on terrorism , Ambassador Lodhi highlighted measures
such as a dedicated counter “ terrorism force , reform of the criminal justice system , and an across the-board military campaign ” the largest anti-terrorism operation anywhere in the world , to destroy terrorist infrastructures and bases in the Pakistan-Afghanistan border region and Pakistani tribal areas .
Pakistan , she said , had lost over 27,000 citizens and law enforcement
personnel to this scourge , with many more injured and maimed for life as well as economic losses of over US $ 120 billion . “ But neither the human nor financial losses have diminished my country 's commitment to fight this menace . It has only reinforced our will to fight until the last terrorist is eliminated from our soil . ”
Success of its counter-terrorism operations had resulted in the sharp
reduction of terrorist activities across Pakistan over the past two years , she said . Still terrorism continues to pose a challenge , but its nature has changed .
“ The threat that we face today is primarily supported and financed from
outside our borders , ” the Pakistani envoy pointed out . “ We are confident that we will be able to defeat these forces too . ”
Ambassador Lodhi reaffirmed Pakistan 's support for the OIC position on a
consensus-based comprehensive convention on international terrorism . The proposed convention must be consistent with international humanitarian law and must clearly differentiate between acts of terrorism and the legitimate struggles for self determination of people living under foreign occupation .
“ The malicious attempts by those who seek to manipulate the
international consensus against terrorism to justify the suppression of people struggling for their right to self-determination must never be permitted to succeed , ” she said in an obvious reference to continuing persecution of people in Kashmir and Palestine .
At the same time , she called for urgent and focused attention to
addressing the festering disputes and unresolved conflicts , unlawful use of force , aggression , foreign occupation and denial of the right to self-determination . “ Political and economic injustice fuels animosities , breeds hostility and often also leads to violent reactions .
“ Without a holistic approach , we will be fighting only the symptoms and
not the underlying causes of this deadly phenomenon . ”
Emphasizing that terrorism should not be associated with any religion ,
faith , race , ethnicity , value system or culture , the Pakistani envoy also called for addressing defamation of religions and demonization of communities that provoke violent reactions .

Trailing by two at the start of the third , the South Carolina Stingrays ( 21-13-1-1 ) staged a three-goal comeback in the final period to defeat the Florida Everblades ( 25-8-1-2 ) 3-2 at Germain Arena on Saturday night .
Colton Saucerman played a big part in the resurgence by scoring his first goal of the season and adding an assist , while Scott Tanski netted the game-winner and Parker Milner made 26 saves to earn his 17th victory of the season .
Neither team was able to get on the board in the opening period , a frame in which each squad registered eight shots on net .
But the Everblades took control of the game in the second , scoring twice to take a 2-0 advantage . First , defenseman Akim Aliu scored his second goal in as many games against the Rays on the power play at 12:04 .
Then in the final seconds of the frame , Zack Kamrass sent Matt Berry in on a breakaway and the forward used a backhand shot to beat Milner up high and give Florida a two-goal lead with just 9.9 remaining on the clock .
Saucerman got the comeback started with his first goal of the season on the power play with a blast that beat Florida netminder Anthony Peters at 6:47 of the third .
Assists on the goal were credited to linemates Kelly Zajac and Joe Devin . The helper was Zajac 's 30th of the season and his 40th point of the year .
Patrick Gaul then tied the game at 2-2 with his sixth goal of the season at 11:03 of the final period with assists from Saucerman and defenseman Steve Weinstein . Saucerman took the initial shot from the right point , which bounced right to Gaul who buried the rebound .
Tanski provided the winner while the Rays were on the man-advantage , scoring on a redirection off a pass by forward Tim McGauley at 17:07 of the third . Domenic Monardo picked up the second assist on the goal for South Carolina , who went 2-for-4 on the power play .
By out-shooting Florida 15-4 in the third , the Stingrays had the advantage in shots on goal for the game , 29-28 . The Everblades went 1-for-4 on the power play in the contest .
Florida was also led by Peters , who held South Carolina off the scoreboard for the first 46 minutes and finished with 26 saves .

A NEWBURY band have had their first taste of fame after their debut album rocked to the top of an online chart .
No Good Sons – Ken Lingus , Simon Catt , Mike Barbour and producer Martin Pawley – hit number one spot on the Amazon rock album chart when their album was released on December 9 .
The band formed in 2015 and , after a few local performances and charity gigs , including regular slots at The Monument in Newbury , started recording their debut album Revelations of a Whiskey Soaked Past .
The album hit number one and finished the day at number two in the chart , with the album ranked 20th overall in all genres .
Mr Lingus said the album is a story about feeling the strains on finding love , having one 's heart torn out and rebuilding back up again to maybe learn from their mistakes .
The album , recorded at Hogans Music Attic Studio in Newbury , features a mix of music , ranging from heavy southern American tracks , blues rock influence , and a few ballads , one with a Latino twist .
Mr Lingus said the album 's success proved that “ good hearty , original rock music ” was not dead just yet in the UK .
He said : “ We expected a few of the locals to purchase and a few of our fans who are on our Facebook page , and that was about it .
“ To hit number one was just the most amazing experience and feeling , which also borderlined with complete shock . ”
The band 's social media page kicked into gear with people sharing the news , comments and pictures of the album 's rise .
Mr Lingus said : “ We knew it would probably only be for a few hours , but we were just amazed at the overwhelming support from all our fans , especially given that we have only played a few local shows .
“ We ended the day second , but beating the likes of Metallica 's new album , Queen and Robbie Williams was just simply amazing .
“ We would very much like to thank all our fans for helping us achieve the impossible , and for their continued support of getting the news about our album out there .
“ It 's been a great year for us , and we could not have done it without them . ”

What 's in a name ? Everything , when it comes to a television show . Its title is its calling card — it can entice someone to tune in — or turn them off completely . And judging by the recent glut of series labeled “ good ” — from “ The Good Place ” to “ The Good Doctor , ” from “ Good Girls ” to “ Good Girls Revolt ” — it can also stir up a bit of marketplace confusion . But maybe it 's a good problem to have .
“ Coming up with a title is one of the most challenging things we do , ” ABC Entertainment president Channing Dungey said during the Television Critics Assn . 's winter press tour in January .
At the time , ABC 's “ Grey 's Anatomy ” spinoff “ Station 19 , ” about the first responders who work at that Seattle firehouse , was still untitled . The show , which falls under the Shondaland banner and comes from showrunner Stacy McKee , was picked up to series in May 2017 as an untitled spinoff . It was given a March premiere date on the Alphabet 's TCA day in January , and its title was finally revealed a few weeks later .
“ Speaking from the marketing perspective , we broach titles in partnership with programming and research starting with development , ” says Erin Weir , senior vice president of marketing strategy at ABC Entertainment . “ A strong title is unique and memorable , easy to pronounce , and a fit with the show content and tone . ”
ABC also has “ The Good Doctor , ” which is just one of the “ good ” shows populating the airwaves . The titular doctor there , played by Freddie Highmore , is both good at his job and a genuinely good person . Executive producer David Shore says he does believe it helps a show when the title perfectly reflects what the show is about so the audience “ knows what they are getting. ” But he admits he was n't entirely sold on this title for his new series at first .
“ I did n't want the ‘ the ' in the title in the beginning , ” Shore says . “ My thinking was , to me it 's slightly more a question and broader without the ‘ the ' — it becomes more about ‘ What does it mean to be a good doctor ? ' instead of ‘ This show is about this guy who is a good doctor . ' I wanted it to be broader and about all of the doctors on the show . ”
Then there 's the matter of NBC 's “ The Good Place , ” which bowed in 2016 . At first glance , it seemed the title was literally describing the setting of the show as Eleanor ( Kristen Bell ) learned she had died but somehow made it to the coveted area in the afterlife for those who had dedicated their lives to selflessness . But the twist at the end of the first season revealed that the title was n't so literal after all , though , as the location Eleanor found herself in was actually an experiment designed to torture humans who had not actually qualified for the real “ good place . ”
ABC did not settle on “ Station 19 's ” title until almost a year after the show was announced , and just weeks ahead of its series premiere date .
“ ‘ The Good Place ' is all story . It 's brilliantly conceived , and it 's a very specific style . This is not a sitcom that takes place in the afterlife , this is ‘ The Good Place , ' and you 're meant to believe [ the place ] is real , even if it 's not [ literal ] , ” series star Ted Danson points out .
Similarly , TNT 's “ Good Behavior , ” which is executive produced by Chad Hodge , delivers a more nuanced interpretation of the word . Although Letty , the con artist at the heart of the show , has good intentions , her actions are often anything but .
“ When the story starts , Letty has just gotten out of prison on ‘ good behavior ' and one day it just hit me that [ that ] could be a great ironic title for the show — because , of course , most of what we see is bad behavior . It 's a story about a con-woman who is trying to be good , but failing over and over , ” Hodge says . “ I love the irony in the title . ”
While Hodge acknowledges that some first-time viewers might turn on his show with different expectations for the story given the title , he notes the most important thing is that they are intrigued enough by the title to watch and talk about it at all .
“ A title just needs to make you do a double-take . It needs to make you wonder . It does n't need to explain anything . It just needs to make you go , ‘ Hmm… ' ” he says .
Jenna Bans ' “ Good Girls , ” which launched earlier this year on NBC , comes with its own sense of irony . While the implication at first is of women who never do anything wrong , the core characters actually rob a grocery store in the pilot .
“ ‘ Good ' has so many meanings , ” Bans said at NBC 's TCA day in January . “ Are they good at what they start doing in the pilot … which is sort of embarking on this life of criminal activity ? Yeah , they 're kind of good at it , so it works on that level . And it also sort of contradicts the image of this perfect wife and mother that 's just going to stay quiet and sort of follow the rules and not raise her voice and not make a stink about anything , so it was sort of a play on that . [ The title ] encapsulates everything we 're really trying to say with the show . ”
Arguably , CBS law drama “ The Good Wife ” started this trend in 2009 , and its CBS All Access spinoff “ The Good Fight ” is continuing it further .
While “ Good Fight ” co-creators Robert King and Michelle King admit that in the beginning the title was selected in great part to keep the new series branded to its predecessor , “ with the election of President Trump , the title took on a deeper resonance for the characters , ” they say . Now it not only is a driving force for the main title sequence but for many of the stories within the show , as well .
“ A title just needs to make you do a double-take . It needs to make you wonder . it does n't need to explain anything . ”
Chad Hodge
“ We always meant the title ironically . ‘ Good Wife ' is the public persona of the main character , but throughout the seasons , we see her turn toward the ‘ bad . ' Similarly , you 're supposed to wonder whether ‘ The Good Fight ' is really that much of a good fight . In what ways do people in pursuing altruistic ends become corrupted ? ” the Kings say .
As an invitation to watch the series , the Kings admit that “ The Good Wife ” always spoke to potential female viewers more than male — so much so that they share that creative executives at the network went through a lot of other options ( “ One in fact was ‘ Scandal ! ' ” ) on the eve of the pickup . But ultimately , what won out was what they felt was the most “ thematically descriptive . ”
Anything beyond the creative behind the title — including how “ hashtag friendly ” it is and marketplace competition — is more often than not left up to executives to work on during the run-up to premiere .
“ Titles are tracked competitively so we do make an effort to avoid similar titles within the same premiere window whenever possible , ” Weir says , noting that although they were “ of course ” aware of the number of “ good ” series when launching “ The Good Doctor , ” research showed the title was a strong enough fit and performing well with test consumers that it was worth using anyway .
“ There is no hard and fast rule , ” Weir says . “ As long as we are hitting the bull 's eye on unique , memorable and fit with concept , there are many paths to success . ”

Adrian Lewis has been suspended by the PDC after a clash with his opponent Jose Justica on the oche at the end of their UK Open Darts qualifier .
The pair had to be separated by stewards after Lewis appeared to push Justica at the end of his 6-5 quarter-final win in Wigan as tensions boiled over .
The drama kicked off in the eighth leg with Lewis heard saying “ You 're trying to p * ss me off , I 'm telling you ” while pointing at his opponent 's chest after they came together .
The pair exchanged words further during the match before finally squaring up on the oche at the end after Lewis completed his winning checkout .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Democrats on the U.S. House Intelligence Committee slammed a controversial memo released by the panel 's Republicans on Friday , calling it a “ shameful effort to discredit ” the FBI , the Justice Department and a federal investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election .
“ The selective release and politicization of classified information sets a terrible precedent and will do long-term damage to the Intelligence Community and our law enforcement agencies , ” they said in a statement .
The Democrats said they hoped to release their own memo responding to the allegations on Feb. 5 .
The DeLorean name is iconic thanks largely to Back to the Future , in which one of the original automaker 's cars was turned into a time machine by ‘ Doc ' Emmett Brown . Now , the original DeLorean founder 's nephew is working on making flying cars a reality , with his own aerospace company .
Paul DeLorean 's DeLorean aerospace is n't actually aiming to exactly replicate the scene from Back to the Future in which the time machine takes off as an airborne vehicle . But it is trying to create a vertical take-off and landing craft ( VTOL ) that would be able to operate in a roughly similar manner , and it 's hoping to have a full-sized prototype ready within a year 's time , according to Wired .
DeLorean 's first aircraft is called the DR-7 VTOL , and it looks like something out of a much more modern sci-fi film . There are two turbines for propulsion , as well as a two-seat cockpit about mid-body . The plan is to make it a fully electric vehicle , and DeLorean has already completed two small-scale models , including a one-third scale engineering model .
Eventually , the hope is to build a final piloted craft that can travel for 120 miles on a full charge , with a body length of 20 feet and a width of 18.5 across the sides stretch of its wingspan . The range is the biggest challenge and its potential standout point among the competition , given that other prototype designs have much shorter projected ranges .
Flying cars have always been cause for imaginative flights of fancy , but more and more they 're becoming targets for actual engineering efforts at big aerospace companies and technology startups . Who knows : Maybe the next Back to the Future will feature an entirely different kind of DeLorean , for which flight is nothing special .

WASINGTON , June 14 ( APP ) : The United States may decide to deploy
additional troops to Afghanistan after President Trump gave the Pentagon the new authority to take a decision on the level of troops in that country , media reports said .
President Trump had been weighing his options following a request of
troops surge in Afghanistan by military generals in the Pentagon . In the backdrop of the new authority , Defense Minster Jim Mattis could now take a decision to deploy additional troops , reports said .
Back in April , the President had given the same authority to the
Pentagon about deciding the number of troops in Iraq and Syria .
Top US military commanders , Gen. John Nicholson of US forces in
Afghanistan , and US Central Command head Gen. Joseph Votel , both have asked for a few thousand more troops for Afghanistan . Taliban has captured some areas since 2014 when the US forces ended their combat mission there .
At a Senate Armed Service Committee hearing on Tuesday , Mattis told
lawmakers that the US was not winning in Afghanistan and that the Taliban was surging throughout the country . The US military leadership believes that sending more troops to Afghanistan will provide more support to Afghans .
Afghan forces have suffered 15,000 casualties in the first eight months
of 2016 , according to the statistics , and there has not been enough recruitment to fill the void . Mattis conceded that Taliban had a “ good year last year .
The United States currently have about 8,400 troops in Afghanistan in
addition to about 5,000 NATO forces . Current US forces are helping Afghan forces in conducing counterterrorism operations and also providing assistance to the Afghan military .
The US has lost more than 2,000 troops since the war began in 2001 . In
addition to 15,000 Afghani troops , more than 3,000 Afghan civilians have also lost their lives in 2016 , the deadliest year so far since the UN mission there started keeping the record in 2009 .
Walmart this morning announced it 's acquiring a leading outdoor retailer Moosejaw for approximately $ 51 million in an all-cash deal . Headquartered in Madison Heights , Michigan , the retailer has both a large online presence and 10 physical stores across Michigan and the midwest U.S. Walmart says it will allow Moosejaw to continue to operate its website and stores as a standalone and complementary brand going forward , much as it has with other recent acquisitions .
The news follows Walmart 's acquisition of online footwear retailer ShoeBuy last month , which took place by way of Jet.com , a company Walmart itself purchased last summer for $ 3 billion . With the addition of Moosejaw , Walmart now operates a number of standalone brands , including also Hayneedle Inc. , another Jet.com purchase , as well as Sam 's Club .
Moosejaw recently made Internet Retailer 's 2017 “ Hot 100 ” list , but Walmart 's interest in the retailer has a lot to do with the category it operates in and the industry relationships it brings to the table , in addition to its expertise in social media marketing which allowed it to attract a younger audience .
The Moosejaw deal will give Walmart another entry point into apparel , a popular online retail category , as the retailer offers over 120,000 SKUs from more than 400 apparel brands , including Patagonia , The North Face , Marmot , Arc'Teryx and others . Beyond clothing and accessories , the store carries related gear for climbing , hiking , camping , snow sports , yoga , swimming and biking .
Clothing and accessories became the largest online retail category for the first time in 2015 , according to comScore , and is now an area of increased competition in the e-commerce industry .
Amazon , for example , has been rapidly expanding into clothing with the addition of its own vertical , Amazon Fashion , where it now sells items from over a half dozen private label brands . It 's reportedly working on its own workout clothing and its own bras , too . Yesterday , it was also reported to be launching its own-label fashion in the U.K .
Founded in 1992 by Robert Wolfe and David Jaffe , Moosejaw today has over 350 employees . The deal closed late in the day on February 13th , and will see Moosejaw CEO Eoin Comerford , his executive team , and all Moosejaw employees joining Walmart 's new U.S. e-commerce retail organization . The employees will continue to be based in Michigan , but Comerford will now oversee the outdoor category for Walmart e-commerce , the retail organization now headed by Scott Hilton .
Moosejaw 's physical stores will remain open , as well . However , the majority of its business is done online – as much as 85 percent .
“ We 're thrilled to join Walmart 's eCommerce team and look forward to the opportunity to lead the outdoor vertical across their online presence , ” said Comerford , in a statement . “ Our new relationship puts us in a unique position to manage these marketplaces for our brand partners , but inclusion on Jet.com or any of Walmart 's e-commerce sites is 100 % at each brand 's discretion . ”
As with Jet.com , Moosejaw will continue to be consumer-facing standalone brand , but integrations behind the scenes could help Walmart . Jet and Walmart merged their warehousing and supply chain operations , allowing Walmart to roll out free , 2-day shipping without a membership in January .
In Moosejaw 's case , Walmart will gain access to the industry relationships the retailer has with top apparel brands , which will allow Walmart to discuss carrying select items from those brands on other storefronts , like Walmart.com , Jet or ShoeBuy , if it chose .
“ There 's going to be a lot of integration on the backend , ” explains Walmart spokesperson Ravi Jariwala , about the deal 's impact at Walmart . “ [ This will include ] things like taking advantage of the bigger scale and leveraging those costs for things like shipping rates , credit card fees , and transaction processing fees , ” he said .
Jariwala also noted that operating Hayneedle independently worked out well for Jet.com , and this is how Walmart will proceed with Moosejaw as well .
“ That 's a model we 're looking to replicate , ” he said .

BOSTON -- Molly Bish was 16 years old and working as a lifeguard at Comins Pond in Warren when she was kidnapped on June 27 , 2000 . Her remains were discovered three years later . Her killer has not been found .
`` We do n't know what our monster looks like , '' Molly 's sister Heather Bish said Wednesday .
There are 129 children in Massachusetts who are missing or whose murderers have not been found . They are boys and girls of all races and ethnicities , from across the state . They include Nailah Sanon , Michael Santos , Leigh Savoie , Patrick Silva , Haley Sousa , Michael Sugura .
The Molly Bish Center and Foundation brought together families , politicians , law enforcement and advocates at the State House Wednesday to commemorate the 18th Missing Children 's Day in Massachusetts .
Worcester District Attorney Joe Early described these cases as the `` most agonizing cases . ''
`` You 're not forgotten , '' Early told the families . `` The hard work will go on , we 'll continue to bring you the best efforts we can for justice . ''
This year , State Rep. Juana Matias , D-Lawrence , sponsored an amendment to the House budget that would require all law enforcement to undergo two hours of mandatory training on how to respond to missing persons cases . It would create uniform policies for police to respond to missing and abducted children .
Matias said there is a need for `` comprehensive standards across the state to ensure when your child goes missing and you walk into a police department , you 're receiving the best practices available in the country . ''
Heather Bish said when Molly Bish went missing , the police did not begin to look for her during the first three hours , even though statistics show that 76 percent of children abducted by strangers are murdered within three hours .
Hampden District Attorney Anthony Gulluni was given an award at Wednesday 's event for his work solving the murder of Lisa Ziegert . Ziegert was a 24-year-old teacher 's assistant at Agawam Middle School when she was abducted and killed in 1992 .
Gary Schara , 48 , was arrested in 2017 on charges of murder , aggravated rape and kidnapping .
Law enforcement officials credited DNA testing for leading them to Schara .
Heather Bish praised Gulluni for taking on unresolved cases with `` new fervor '' and using state-of-the-art technology to develop an image of Ziegert 's killer from DNA .
`` The heroes are the families of missing children and murder victims , '' Gulluni said . `` They are the heroes , they are those who deserve acknowledgement and our respect and our continued work and support and affection . ''
Lisa Ziegert 's mother , Dianne `` Dee '' Ziegert , presented Gulluni with the award .
In an interview after the event , Ziegert said it feels different to her to have Schara caught . `` You expect when they catch the person responsible that it 's going to change your life , '' Ziegert said . `` It does n't , because the realization is we 've got them , that 's great , but Lisa 's still gone . ''
But at the same time , Ziegert said the anniversary of her daughter 's abduction felt lighter .
`` When I went to visit her this year on the anniversary , I did n't have to say 'Lisa , another year and we do n't have any answers , we do n't have any justice for you , ' '' Ziegert said . `` This year I could say , 'We got it . ' ''

Covers Products : Sumatra Dark roast , Scarlet Red
Introduced at the 2017 Winter Fancy Food Show , Fogdog is Bay Area-based startup that is launching the industry 's first hydrodynamic cold brew coffee and tea .
What is hydrodynamic cold brew ? Great question . It 's a patent-pending cold extraction process that , according to the company , preserves the natural aromas , flavors , and textures of cold brew coffee and tea while eliminating any unpleasant bitterness .
From our vantage point , we 're honestly not sure how this is any different from any other cold-brew out there . Many of the cold-brew companies that pitch us stress their “ proprietary process ” ( although it 's generally about water quality , steep time , or something less fancy sounding than “ hydrodynamic ” ) and how “ their process ” gets the best flavor and the least amount of bitterness . However , the differences in flavor between most of these products are , as we 've cited in many other cold-brew coffee reviews , quite nuanced and not something that most consumers will notice or care about .
Unfortunately , that 's pretty much the case for Fogdog , too , despite its having a patent-pending process . There are two varieties , a coffee ( Sumatra Dark Roast ) and a tea ( Scarlet Red Herbal Tea ) , and neither one is in the upper echelon of flavor in their respective category .
For the coffee , which is made using only coffee beans and water , there is a creaminess to the body that comes from their process ( according to the copy on the bottle ) . While this is unique and enjoyable , the coffee itself has a slightly burnt note and the finish is actually somewhat bitter in comparison to the competition 's . At least for our palates , we would n't make a sacrifice on flavor just for a textural improvement .
When it comes to the tea , the story is a bit different . Scarlet Red has a more complex list of ingredients , including water , hibiscus , orange peel , lemongrass , elderberries , apple pieces , rooibos orange , rooibos long cut , and stevia leaves . Unlike the coffee , which has a textural benefit from the cold-extraction process , this variety seems to gain a slightly more intense rooibos and hibiscus flavor from their process . While this part is good , we 're really not fond of the stevia flavor . If they could improve or eliminate this we 'd find it to be a much more enjoyable product .
Finally , let 's take a look at the packaging and branding . The product uses a round 12 oz . plastic bottle that has a sleeve label that covers the entire bottle . There 's a white and light grey background for the tea while the coffee gets a darker grey backdrop . The branding is otherwise really minimalist , with somewhat plain looking text being the only thing that you 'll find on the label . When we hear the name “ Fogdog ” it says something that 's inviting and playful , but this feels technical and serious .
Ultimately , we 're left feeling as though Fogdog needs some focus and refinement . We think it 's going to be really hard to be a general “ cold brew ” company ( as opposed to one that 's specifically coffee or tea ) and the positioning of the brand and the overall flavor need to improve to stand up against their competition .

Michael Vaughan says English cricket needs to put an end to its “ unprofessional ” attitude , writes Dean Wilson in Perth .
The former England skipper pulled no punches as he called for changes to finally come in the light of incidents involving Ben Stokes , Jonny Bairstow and now Ben Duckett .
Vaughan admits players and teams have been ‘ unprofessional ' in the past and now the game must take this chance to move forward .
“ The majority of this England side are very professional , ” said the Yorkshireman , now a BT Sport pundit covering this winter 's Ashes . “ They train as hard as any England side I 've seen , but you have one or two bad eggs in the group who act like students when they go out .
( Image : EPA-EFE/REX/Shutterstock )
“ They are England cricketers and the cultural side of cricket in terms of alcohol does need to change .
“ If you look at the game before my time and through my time playing , we did drink a lot —'As soon as the game finishes , we get stuck in ' . It is time that we stopped talking about what we did as if that was great , because it was n't .
“ We were unprofessional for the majority of our playing days . We went out too much and I do think cricket has to look at itself and ask ‘ Do we want to keep going down that road ? '
“ Football gets the odd bad headline , but a Premier League footballer looks after himself much better than he did 10 or 20 years ago .
“ If you could say that cricketers look after themselves better ... yes in terms of physicality , and yes they train better , but do they drink as much as we used to ? Yes . And that has to change . ”
The current tour has been mired in controversy ever since Ben Stokes was arrested in Bristol during a late-night out late last summer and that incident is clinging to these Ashes like a wet shower curtain .
Whatever the outcome of the police investigation , one thing is certain , Stokes ' influence on this tour has been monumental for the wrong reasons .

Duckett has now been fined and given a final warning following an incident at the same club Bairstow courted controversy at the start of the tour .
While Duckett is the fall guy for now , there are answers needed from senior players who were there as things got rowdy .
“ I would question the whole group , ” added Vaughan .
“ Ben Duckett is a young kid and I would question the senior boys out that night . They are the role models for all the Lions and the young players .

“ I do think the punishments need to be stronger now . If Trevor Bayliss thinks that he has got to get rid of a few people . then that is what he has got to do .
“ This has all been brought to light by the Ben Stokes incident . That is where we 're at and the surveillance on the side is purely because of what happened in Bristol .
“ The perception of this England side is that they drink and party too much . There 's only one way to deal with it – do n't do it . They 're going to have to spend a long time now as a team trying to earn back the trust of the supporters . ”

The City of Victoria is planning on creating a new emergency operation centre to replace the old firehall on Yates Street .
The projected $ 35.9 million multi-use development proposal is slated for a property the city plans to buy Johnson Street near Cook Street .
The new facility will be post-seismic rated and will also have B.C . Ambulance as tenants .
Victoria Mayor Lisa Helps says they are saving $ 12 million by going this route downtown , instead of simply building a standalone fire hall on the current site .
“ Moving the firehall from Yates Street to downtown into a mixed-use building makes a lot of sense with the amount of density we are seeing downtown . ”
The new space will be 41,700 square ft , replacing the 26,000 square ft old fire hall on Yate Street which has been in operation since 1959 .
“ The inclusion of an Emergency Operations Centre capable of managing hazard response specific to the City of Victoria is a practical and effective improvement to the management of emergencies on a holistic level , ” said Fire Chief Paul Bruce .
The city says $ 30 million for the project is coming out of the debt Reduction Reserve , meaning there will be no increase in property tax .
Local developer Dalmatian Developments Limited partnership is getting the contract .
The proposed project still needs to go through funding and rezoning approval at City Council .
The estimating construction time is estimated at 28 months .
KYBURZ , Calif. ( AP )  A key mountain route between Sacramento and South Lake Tahoe is closed indefinitely because of a series of mudslides .
Caltrans said Monday that crews are clearing three major slides and several smaller ones along a 30 mile stretch of State Route 50 .
The highway is closed in both directions between the communities of Pollock Pines and Strawberry in El Dorado County . Workers on steep slopes are contending with hillsides that are sodden and loose from recent storms .
The Sacramento Bee reports ( http : //bit.ly/2l40aGI ) a mudslide Sunday near Kyburz was more than 400 feet long .

China announces ban on ivory trade by end of 2017
China has announced a ban on all ivory trade and processing activities by the end of 2017 .
Conservation groups hailed the decision as “ historic ” and a “ game-changer ” for the future of elephants .
The move follows a resolution at the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species ( Cites ) in South Africa in October .
China has the biggest ivory market in the world – some estimates suggest 70 % of the world 's trade ends up there .
Ivory can reach $ 1,100 ( £850 ) per kilogram in China .
‘ Great leadership '
China 's State Council announced the details of the ban on Friday .
The commercial processing and sale of ivory will stop by 31 March , and all registered traders will then be phased out , bringing a full halt to the market by the end of the year .
Conservation group WWF welcomed the latest news , calling it a “ historic announcement… signalling an end to the world 's primary legal ivory market and a major boost to international efforts to tackle the elephant poaching crisis in Africa ” .
Elly Pepper , deputy director of wildlife trade for the Natural Resources Defense Council , praised China for its “ great leadership ” on the issue .
“ Setting such an aggressive timeline to close – once and for all – the largest domestic ivory market in the world is globally significant .
“ It 's a game changer and could be the pivotal turning point that brings elephants back from the brink of extinction , ” she said .
While the international market in ivory has been closed since 1989 , legal domestic markets have continued in many countries around the world .
A surge in the killing of elephants over the past seven years has seen populations across Africa shrink by a third , according to the recently published Great Elephant Census .
China had backed the Cites resolution in October , surprising participants with the strength of its support for a ban .
Some delegates said Beijing had wanted an even stronger resolution .

SAN FRANCISCO ( Reuters ) - When Americans snack on pizza , beer and guacamole this Sunday as they watch the Philadelphia Eagles square off against the New England Patriots , the Super Bowl will not be the only contest going on in their living rooms .
Companies long associated with Super Bowl staples and their ingredients , including Papa John 's International and Anheuser Busch InBev , are locked in their own competitions to beat rivals and win the favor of customers and investors .
PIZZA
Shares of Papa John 's International have dropped 23 percent over the past year as its status as the “ official pizza sponsor ” of National Football League and the Super Bowl has changed from a benefit to a liability .
In November , Papa John 's founder and then-Chief Executive John Schnatter blamed its lukewarm pizza sales on the league 's handling of players ' national-anthem protests against racial inequality . The player controversy has hurt the NFL 's already dwindling TV viewership . Schnatter 's comments generated a huge backlash on social media , prompting the company to apologize , and it later announced Schnatter 's resignation .
“ The NFL 's popularity is on the decline , and Papa John 's is associated with them , ” said BTIG analyst Peter Saleh . “ The NFL partnership is no longer benefiting them , and it 's something they 're still under contract for . ”
Larger rival Domino 's Pizza is also switching leaders , with Chief Executive Patrick Doyle set to step down in June . Doyle presided over a successful turnaround and led the industry in leveraging data analytics to boost sales , earning him acclaim on Wall Street . His replacement by Richard Allison , currently president of Domino 's international business , may create uncertainty among investors .
Domino 's is expected by analysts to post 8 percent revenue growth in 2018 , compared to growth under 2 percent at Papa John ‘ s . Domino 's is also trading at a higher valuation , equivalent to 27 times expected earnings , versus Papa John 's valuation of 22 times earnings .
GUACAMOLE
Guacamole is a staple living room snack on Super Bowl Sunday , with consumers spending $ 62 million on avocados , the dip 's main ingredient , in the two weeks leading up to last year 's game , according to Nielson .
Add to that , the fruit 's popularity among U.S. millennials , a key demographic , and investors may do well look at Limoneira , which grows the fruit , and Calavo Growers Inc , which markets and distributes it .
“ Fresh food is growing quickly , and within fruits and vegetables , avocado is one of the leaders , ” said Lake Street Capital Markets analyst Chris Krueger , who has “ buy ” recommendations on Calavo and Limoneira . He noted that recent price increases for avocados should be positive for Calavo .
The CEOs of both companies sit on each other 's boards and their headquarters are close neighbors in Santa Paula , California .
Double-digit sales expansion has helped push Calavo 's stock up 58 percent in the past year , and all four analysts who cover it recommend buying . However , its recent rally has left Calavo trading at 29 times expected earnings , which is above its own five-year average of 23 . Shares of Limoneira , which grows lemons and is also the largest U.S. avocado producer , dropped in December as strong winds blew a wildfire through prime avocado growing country in Southern California .
But Limoneira has said its crops escaped significant damage , and it expects to increase its operating income by at least 32 percent in fiscal 2018 . Limoneira 's stock remains down 15 percent from before the California blazes broke out in December .
BEER
Anheuser-Busch InBev 's Budweiser commercials have long been a Super Bowl mainstay , but the world 's largest brewer faces growing competition from smaller , younger rivals offering IPAs and other premium beers to drinkers with increasingly discriminating taste buds . U.S. consumers spent $ 1.3 billion on beer in the two weeks ahead of last year 's Super Bowl , including $ 166 million on craft brews , according to Nielson .
Smaller rivals Craft Brew Alliance , which makes Kona , and Boston Beer Company , which sells Samuel Adams , have seen their stocks surge over 20 percent in the past year .
But those gains have left Craft Brew Alliance trading at 56 times expected earnings and Boston Beer Company at 27 times earnings , potentially expensive valuations . Meanwhile , AB InBev has snapped up 10 U.S. craft brewers in the past decade , and its stock is trading at a less expensive 22 times expected earnings .
A Vallejo man who claims he fatally shot his ex-girlfriend during a struggle over a gun made an appearance Friday in Solano County Superior Court ahead of his December trial .
Ishmeal B. Zeno , 38 , is charged with murder and being a felon in possession of a firearm in the Dec. 18 , 2016 , death of 35-year-old Melissa Owens . Owens was killed at the Myrtlewood Court residence she shared with the defendant and their 3-year-old son .
Vallejo police found Owens ' body around 11:30 p.m. , with Zeno having already fled the home .
Past court discussions revealed the pair were living together solely to raise their son , with the victim reportedly dating other people , which bothered Zeno .
Zeno and Owens allegedly got into an argument earlier that evening after Owens arrived at the residence , with Zeno concerned about the whereabouts of their son . The child was staying at a friend 's home in Antioch , per court discussions . Zeno has claimed Owens retrieved the gun from inside the residence and pointed it at him , which prompted him to try to take it from her .
Zeno also has stated that Owens was shot during a struggle for the gun and that he does n't recall who pulled the trigger . Following the shooting , Zeno fled to Antioch to say goodbye to his son . He turned himself into police the next day .
Zeno will be back in court Nov. 8 for a trial readiness conference . His trial is still slated for 9 a.m. Dec. 5 in Department 25 .
He remains jailed with a $ 2.5 million bail .

Jurgen Klopp claims a top four finish this season would be a success .
Even before his countryman Didi Hamann became the latest Anfield old boy suggesting he needs a trophy to avoid the sack , the German was aware of the brutal demands a Liverpool boss faces .
Yet Klopp is also a pragmatist who knows that , despite their history , his club has no divine right to success any more ... and is now placed firmly behind the bigger-spending aristocrats of Manchester 's United and City , Chelsea and Arsenal in the pecking order of English football .
That is why he talks of winning the title being the dream he starts with every season , when finishing ahead of at least two clubs who spend more than Liverpool on wages is a more realistic marker of success in football 's nuclear arms race .

A home win over rivals Tottenham on Sunday , in a game he cheerfully admits is a “ six-pointer ” would take them a step closer to that goal this season , and he said : “ Top four , for sure , is a success .
“ When you start a season , you can dream of something and you have to make a realistic target as well . I think being champion is probably the dream — not only at Liverpool , but especially at Liverpool .
“ Because of the season City is playing , that is quite difficult . Then I would prefer to be second if you can not be first . But if you are second , third or fourth at the end of the season , when you look back all three positions are good — and similarly difficult to reach .

“ Arsenal are not out of it . Tottenham is behind all of us at the moment , but only a couple of points . So it is tough to be top four . ”
That will hardly play well with certain impatient sections of the Anfield crowd , nor old boys such as Hamann , Graeme Souness , John Toshack and Luis Garcia , who have all suggested recently that the manager desperately needs a trophy now he 's into a third year in charge .
Yet for Klopp , it is a process .
Almost exactly a year ago , when his Reds faced - and outplayed – Spurs at Anfield , he spoke about their opponents being further ahead of Liverpool in their development .
Now the gap is closed , with only City currently out of reach .
But Klopp believes there is one important element in the Tottenham trajectory to turn his own title dream into a hard and fast reality – keeping your best players .
“ That they can keep their squad together for so long is a big sign to be honest . Harry Kane is still there , even though the whole world is going nuts transfer wise .
“ I think if someone has too much money or more than enough then it would make sense to ask , ‘ Do n't you want to play for our team ? ' He is obviously an outstanding top level since I was in England at least .
“ Dele Alli is not the same season as last season but still the highest quality , Eriksen constantly 'Pfff ! ' ... They are just a good side and they are still together .
“ The whole world buys players from everywhere , but no one buys one player from Tottenham . Maybe they do n't want to go . You can imagine working together helps a lot . With these players and the age group , the players are closer to 20 than 30 , that is a very very interesting project . ”
Yet Liverpool is ahead of Spurs in the table , and can open an important gap with victory .

For Klopp , that is not enough , even if it takes him past one more of his rivals :
“ In the end I think to fulfil our dreams at some points we have to overtake all of them We have to be ready for achieving the biggest thing , I can only say with all the respect that Tottenham is a really interesting project . ”
Klopp will restore £75m defender Virgil van Dijk to his starting line-up and Gino Wijnaldum could also return in midfield .
In this photo , the Michigan State womens gymnastics team participates in a meet in East Lansing , Mich . The womens gymnastics team is trying to move on from the Larry Nassar scandal . The schools disgraced former sports doctor is facing the rest of his life in prison for molesting girls and young women . The gymnasts left behind are trying to move on with their competitions while honoring the survivors . Larry Lage  The Associated Press
EAST LANSING , Mich. > > The gymnasts danced like no one was watching , a joyous circle of pink-clad young women celebrating a meet with their teammates .
In truth , all eyes seem to be on Michigan State in these troubled days .
There are sharp questions for football coach Mark Dantonio and basketball coach Tom Izzo about allegations of sexual misconduct by their players over the years .
But above all , there is Larry Nassar , the disgraced former sports doctor who is facing the rest of his life in prison for molesting girls and young women under the guise of treatment . Nassar isnt associated with football or basketball . He stands accused of abusing mostly young gymnasts , some of them stars for Team USA , and he will forever be tied to Michigan State  his former employer .

But on this night , the Spartans tried to celebrate a feel-good moment on a campus in desperate need of one .
I know everyone sees Larry Nassar and they think of Michigan State gymnastics ,  said Sydney Ewing , the only recruit to sign with the program in November during the early signing period . But the girls didnt do anything wrong . I think supporting them right now is the best thing they need to get through this.
The gymnasts left behind are trying to move on with their competitions while honoring the victims  some of whom may be on the team  of Nassars abuse . In front of a record crowd for a quad meet at Jenison Field House , where Magic Johnson played basketball four decades ago , the Spartans had a season-high score to beat Eastern Michigan , Rutgers and Pittsburgh .
Lea Mitchell , who won the all-around for the second time in three meets , put on a show . Her teammates along with 2,844 fans in the stands did , too . The crowd , which was about three times larger than usual , included Michigan State athletes from other sports .
Mitchell sprinted down a blue runway , launched off a springboard onto the vault , did a flipping twist , landed on her feet and threw her hands in the air . The freshman was immediately encircled by high-fiving teammates as the fans roared .
Mitchell and her teammates could have bolted by now because of the Nassar scandal . No one wouldve blamed them . The NCAA has indicated it may investigate the athletic department , and the Michigan attorney general will press ahead with an investigation of the university .
We cant run ,  said Mitchell , who is from Boynton Beach , Florida . We have to stay together and change the culture . It has to start somewhere.
Missed opportunities to possibly stop Nassar abound .
Larissa Boyce said she and a fellow teenage teammate , both training with the Spartans youth gymnastics team , complained about him in 1997 to head gymnastics coach Kathie Klages . She retired a year ago , one day after being suspended for what former athletic director Mark Hollis described as her passionate defense of Nassar . Some athletes suggested Klages indirectly discouraged them from reporting abuse with her outspoken support of Nassar . Klages has not responded to requests seeking comment .
Mike Rowe , who was a Michigan State assistant the previous three seasons , was promoted in July to guide the program through a storm .
Weve been working really hard on focus , keeping our eyes on not being distracted and letting any kind outside influences affect the performance ,  said Rowe , who like the teams gymnasts , wore a teal ribbon last weekend to raise awareness about sexual violence . In the gym every day , its kind of our solitude . Its kind of our place of peace.
In the same building where Nassar carried out some of his crimes , the team has had the same athletic trainer , Destiny Teachnor-Hauk , for two decades . She reportedly received at least one complaint about Nassar from a softball player two decades ago , but Teachnor-Hauk told the FBI and campus police during an investigation she never had athletes tell her Nassar made them uncomfortable .
Teachnor-Hauk also said she was aware of Nassar treating one gymnast at his home , but it did not raise any red flags for her . Teachnor-Hauk declined comment for this story through a school spokesman .
The crisis on campus has led to Lou Anna Simon resigning as school president and Hollis retiring . Rowe said he hopes the women he coaches dont lose the athletic trainer they love to the world and back ,  too .
They probably would be devastated if she had to be replaced or go somewhere else ,  Rowe said .
Jessica Ling , a junior on the team , agreed .
Destiny is a one-of-a-kind person and she honestly cares about all of us  100 percent ,  Ling said . Shes like our second mom . She has helped me personally immensely in my recovery to come back ( from knee surgeries ) and I couldnt have done it without her.
Ewing made the trip from Texas to watch the Spartans compete and to visit campus again with her father , Steve Ewing , who insisted he has no fear of sending his daughter to Michigan State to be a gymnast and student .
Im not scared ,  he said . This is going to be the cleanest , safest program in the country . Its going to be squeaky clean . They got rid of a bad element that is no longer here.

MAPUSA
Chief Minister Manohar Parrikar , on Monday , assured all the stakeholders of Downtown Planning Scheme for Mapusa , that state-of-the-art infrastructure will be constructed , and no work will be undertaken until the entire plan is readied .
The plots developed under the scheme will be commercial zone 1 plots with FAR of 300 , which will be given to the landowners and tenants , who will be free to develop them with some restriction on architecture .
The meeting of the stakeholders of Downtown Planning Scheme for Mapusa was held at a hotel in Guirim and was organised by North Goa Planning and Development Authority ‘ s town planning scheme cell .
Besides Parrikar , Urban Development Minister Francis D'Souza , chairman of North Goa Planning and Development Authority Michael Lobo , chairperson of Mapusa Municipal Council Rohan Kavlekar , vice chairman of Goa State Urban Development Agency Sandip Falari , member secretary of NGPDA R K Pandita , councillor Ryan Braganza , Martin Carrasco , Joshua D'Souza and a representative of LKS , consultant for the project , were present .
During the meeting , PowerPoint presentation was made on planning for Downtown Planning Scheme .
Parrikar said that the scheme is voluntary , and the same will taken up with the consent of landowners and tenants .
“ The area of the land identified for the scheme is around 18 lakh square metres , and the work on the scheme will only start after participation letters are received by the government from landowners and tenants . The government will then draw the plan , wherein the land will be divided equally that is one third share for the government , one third for landowners and the remaining will be for undertaking development , ” he said .
He said that the concerned landowners or tenants will get 1/3 share , with FAR of 300 , which they can develop but there will be restriction in terms of architecture , so that everything will be in sync with the planning .
Commenting on the infrastructure to be created , he said that the scheme will have 24 hours water and electricity , and will have solid waste management system , water treatment plant , underground cabling , Ravindra Bhavan , public library , city centre , artificial lake , joggers ' park and commercial project .
In the next three months , “ if we receive the good number of participation letters for the scheme , ” then in one year 's time the property will develop and the promised share will be given to concerned owners/tenants , he said adding
the state government will start to take up its projects only after the particular share of the developed property is handed over to the concerned owners/tenants .
Commenting further , the Chief Minister said that “ plots admeasuring more than 1000 square metres will be handed over to owners for development but in case of plots with size less than 1000 square metres , then those owners will not be able to develop those plots as the minimum size required is 1000 square metres . Hence the government will give them cash redeemable certificate of the particular amount , which will be fixed , and the owners will be able to either sell the plots to others or return the rights to the government , who would pay the fixed amount . ”
D'Souza said that “ when a land is acquired , the farmers or landowners hardly get any value for the land but under this scheme , the owners will be getting the developed plots . ”
Lobo said that this scheme is a win-win situation for the owners and also tenants as they will be getting commercial plots with developed infrastructure .
PHILADELPHIA -- Michael Bennett wasted no time taking aim at the NFC East quarterbacks he 'll soon be chasing after .
`` I know Eli Manning is probably watching this and thinking ... yes , I 'm coming . I know Dak [ Prescott ] is watching this like , 'Yeah , he 's coming . ' Yeah , I am , '' Bennett said at his introductory news conference Monday as a member of the Eagles . `` And Alex Smith , he knows he ca n't run from me . I told him in the Pro Bowl .
Editor 's Picks Wentz posts online video of himself throwing Eagles quarterback Carson Wentz , who is rehabbing after suffering a torn ACL and LCL last season , posted video of himself throwing inside the team 's practice facility Monday .
'The Super Bowl champs wanted me ' : Haloti Ngata finds fit with Eagles Haloti Ngata won a ring with Baltimore five years ago , and the pursuit of another is what brought him to the city where his idol looms large . 1 Related
`` It 's definitely going to be a great season and it 's going to be fun to be out here and be able to chase quarterbacks . ''
Bennett , 32 , was recently acquired from the Seahawks along with a seventh-round pick for a fifth-round pick and wide receiver Marcus Johnson . He joins a deep defensive line group in Philadelphia that includes defensive ends Brandon Graham , Chris Long and Derek Barnett , as well as tackles Fletcher Cox , Tim Jernigan and Haloti Ngata .
`` I think it can be one of the greatest . I think we can have one of the greatest defensive lines to ever play the game if we approach the game like every single way , just go out there and keep doing what they 're doing and just finding a way to just add and keep showing how many great players [ we have ] . And I think a great defensive line is about the rotation . It 's kind of like Golden State , you want to be able to have those guys that can come in and shoot and shoot and score every time , '' Bennett said .
Given the number of players vying for snaps , as well as defensive coordinator Jim Schwartz 's preference to rotate his linemen , Bennett 's playing time is likely to dip -- he played 931 snaps for Seattle last year en route to an 8½-sack campaign , while no member of the Eagles ' line played more than 663 snaps last year .
But when he does get on the field , he 'll be able to hunt in Schwartz 's attack scheme .
`` I think in Seattle , it 's a little bit more responsibility because we played a little bit different defense -- still played with great defensive linemen ; Cliff Avril , one of the best players to ever play the game , I had so many great players around me who were some of the best players to ever play -- and so here , this defense is just another opportunity to line up on tight ends . And honestly , I do n't think there 's a tight end in the NFL that can block me , '' he said before launching into his bit about the quarterbacks in the division .
`` So it 's definitely going to be a great season , it 's going to be fun to be out here and be able to chase quarterbacks [ not just on ] third down , it 's going to be on second down and first down . It 's just going to be fun . ''
Bennett , who found out about the trade while on vacation in Japan , started the news conference by thanking the Seahawks , the franchise he split with after five successful seasons that included two trips to the Super Bowl and one Lombardi trophy .
Bennett pushed back at the notion that he was moved because of his role on the social activism front , believing it was more about Seattle 's desire to go younger and get value out of some of the aging veteran players while it still could . He declined to answer whether he would continue his protests during the national anthem while in Philadelphia , but touted the Eagles organization for its participation in off-field issues while expressing a desire to make an impact in the community .
`` It 's not just about winning championships on the field , it 's about being a champion off the field and being able to work in the community with men and young women all across this city and be able to give back , '' he said .
The New England Patriots may not have Rob Gronkowski due to a one-game suspension . But they do have a handful of other skills players whose statuses were in question .
Receiver Chris Hogan will make his return after missing five weeks and four games . Dion Lewis , who dealt with an illness during the week , will also play .
“ How I wished during those sleepless
hours that I belonged to a different nation ,

A glance at his profile reveals bits and pieces from which you can patch together his person : poetry , musings , an avidness for photography , friendships , quotes from books , posts on global affairs and local issues , a love for knowledge , an interest in Sufism , support for women 's rights and a heart for humanity .
This was Mashal Khan , a kind and gentle soul whose crime was to think freely , to have the audacity to think differently , and to envision a better society and a better people .
He was brutally murdered in Mardan .
Is it even a shock that such a horrific incident took place in a country which has institutionalised bigotry and hate ? Where politicians , representatives , leaders , judges , journalists , anchors and clerics peddle hate , bigotry and violence every single day ?
Before the matter of blasphemous posts was concocted , Mashal was accused of being an Ahmadi which he had denied .
Is such an incident unexpected in a land whose laws enshrine exclusion , discrimination and persecution towards the Ahmadi community ?
When the state sanctions hate , it is a license for the public to have a free hand to apply it wherever and whenever they wish .
The gruesome incident also forces questions about blasphemy in Pakistan , including the reform and the repeal of the Blasphemy Law .
It is undeniable that the matter warrants honest and candid debate , but it is also a point to ponder whether or not the people would stop baying for blood if the Blasphemy Law goes .
In Mashal 's case , neither a formal complaint nor an arrest had taken place .
There has been no appeal to law , mob vigilantism was the law of the day .
The baying for blood may not disappear with the Blasphemy Law , but let us be clear that state patronage of certain ideologies and ideas opens the floodgates for abhorrent public sentiments and abominable tendencies and menaces to come to the fore and actively play out .
Trump 's ascent to the White House and the boost it has been for white-supremacists and racists stands stark in sight .
One need not even look so far for proof of this , a glimpse at our eastern neighbour suffices .
Modi 's rise has emboldened Hindu right-wing organisations and India has subsequently seen a sharp growth in incidents of violence , fear , threat and intimidation against those who provoke their ire .
In Pakistan , state patronage of certain ideologies and ideas , a certain narrative of Islam and the narrative of blasphemy , is an encouragement for the public to engage , express and execute their depraved schemes , bigotry , intolerance , and to take the law into their hands .
Mashal 's murder , however , must not push us into the utopian expectation and idealistic hope that the Pakistani government and state would step up to reflect on their responsibility , their complicity and decisively act to steer the country away from the destruction it is steeply descending into by each passing day .
Such an expectation and hope can not be fostered while the state and government pander and patronise for their own agendas and interests the very elements and organisations whose extremism , intolerance and violence are fatally injuring Pakistan .
Such a hope can not be kept while religion is employed as a potent weapon for political expediency , for cheap political mileage and for silencing dissent ; while lawmakers declare those who wish to see Pakistan should either mend their ways or leave the country ; while the Prime Minister 's son-in-law engages in hate speech against the Ahmadi community ; while political parties scurry to shake hands bloodied with the lives of thousands of Pakistanis , in the name of electoral alliances ; when disappeared bloggers and arrested professors are struck with blasphemy allegations ; when the Interior Minister threatens to shut down social media due to blasphemous content ; when judges become moral crusaders and drum up perceived dangers to Islam to curtail freedoms .
That this witch-hunt and venom would extend and seep into online spaces was only inevitable .
It is too much to expect for things to change when not a leaf stirred when Taseer and Shahbaz Bhatti were gunned down in broad daylight , when the Christian couple of a pregnant Shama and her husband Shehzad were lynched and thrown into the furnace of a brick kiln , or when an angry mob set fire to a house in Gujranwala killing three Ahmadis including eight-month-old Hira , and five-year-old Kainat .
The involvement of ordinary people in such acts does much to underscore the extent , gravity and ideological and cultural facets of the prevalent challenge of extremism and intolerance confronting Pakistan .
We are complicit , through our outright espousal of extremism , through our apathy towards its victims ; through the stutter and stammer of our tongue with “ ifs ” and “ buts ” when condemning these acts , through the repugnant “ justifications ” , “ explanations ” and “ questions ” we offer for these acts ; and through our refusal and silences to protest against them .
In one way or another , we are complicit .
When an institution of education , knowledge and learning becomes the site of a cold-blooded , brutal murder , it should be enough to recognise that the Pakistani state is a rotten state , with a diseased society , both of which can never bear a truly living and thinking individual like Mashal .
The state is complicit , and so are we .
We may not have been present at the site of the murder , but we enabled it .
One can suppose that the splatters of blood are lighter on our hands , but know that they are there nonetheless .
Every day , this country dies a ghastly death at the hands of the mob it has the misfortune of calling its people , its nation .
It seems even God has forsaken Pakistan for we alone are responsible for the hell and havoc at home .

BMW will end production of the F80-generation M3 in August because the car wo n't conform to Europe 's more stringent emissions limits .
A brand spokesman told Autocar that the super-saloon model , which produces 425bhp from its turbocharged straight-six , would need a new particulate filter in order to meet the requirements of the new Worldwide Harmonised Light Vehicle Test Procedure ( WLTP ) .
The rehomologation process that follows such a change would prevent the updated M3 from making it to market before the next-generation 3 Series is revealed in October . As such , BMW has chosen to pull the car early and end its production alongside the rest of the 3 Series range , rather than keep it in production for longer the way it has with its forebears .

NEW DELHI : The Supreme Court on Monday made it clear that the lieutenant governor of Delhi ca n't act independently of the state government , ca n't be obstructionist toward what is an elected government and is not superior to the elected chief minister . A range of reactions to the verdict followed . Here are some of them : * * Arvind Kejriwal , Delhi 's Aam Aadmi Party AAP ) chief minister : `` A big victory for the people of Delhi ... a big victory for democracy ... '' * * Manish Sisodia , Delhi deputy chief minister : `` On behalf of people of Delhi I thank the hon'ble Supreme Court wholeheartedly . The people 's chosen government can now take decisions for the people of Delhi '' * * Sheila Dixit , former Congress chief minister of Delhi : `` I think what the SC has said is very clear . As per Article 239 ( AA ) of the Constitution , Delhi is not a state , it is a UT ( Union Territory ) . If the Delhi government and the lieutenant governor ( LG ) do n't work together then Delhi will face problems . The Congress ruled Delhi for 15 years , no conflict took place then . `` * * Abhishek Singhvi , Congress spokesman : `` In principle , good judgement for Delhi , irrespective of politics or governments . Why should LG act beyond 3 reserved powers ? Equal responsibility on NCT government to exercise its powers ( minus 3 reserved areas ) responsibly and not have confrontational and deliberately provocative stand on every issue . `` * * Soli Sorabjee , former attorney general of India : `` It 's a good verdict by Supreme Court . LG and Delhi government have to work harmoniously , ca n't always have confrontation . Daily squabbles are not good for democracy . I welcome the decision . `` * * Ajay Maken , senior Congress leader and former Union minister : Now , since the apex court has clarified about the powers in Delhi , we hope that the development which has been stalled , ever since the Congress was voted out of power four years ago-will start again . `` * * Sitaram Yechury , CPM general secretary : The role of LGs and Governors and their misuse has been brought into sharp focus by today 's judgement . BJP 's charade of cooperative federalism and in reality , destroying our federal structure is condemnable . LGs/Governors can not usurp rights of an elected state government . `` * * Manoj Tiwari , president of Delhi BJP : `` Arvind Kejriwal ji , now do n't spread anarchy , the Constitution is supreme , now start following constitution and work for betterment of Delhiites ! ! `` * * Subramanian Swamy , BJP Rajya Sabha MP : `` Yes , what the SC said is correct that LG must respect Delhi cabinet decisions , but if any anti-national security or anti-constitutional decision is taken , which they are capable of taking , as they are Naxalite type people , then LG can oppose . `` * * Jayant Chaudhary , Lok Dal leader : `` SC decision makes it clear that elected government responsible for Delhi ; what will be the reply of LG , Central Govt and PM Narendra Modi who created constitutional crisis in Delhi for past 3 years for political gains . `` * * N Kohli , BJP leader : `` Do n't understand how Delhi government is claiming this to be a victory ? Their main plank was that this is a state whereas court has unequivocally said it 's not a state . They said they had exclusive executive control that was rejected too . This is a UT , Centre has a role to play : * * Shiromani Akali Dal spokesperson and Delhi MLA Manjinder A Sirsa : `` Today 's judgement has once again proved how CM Arvind Kejriwal has wasted last 3.5 years using excuse of full statehood to hide failures of his government . `` * * Manjinder Sirsa , Shiromani Akali Dal : `` Today 's judgement has once again proved how CM @ ArvindKejriwal has wasted last 3.5 years using the EXCUSE of full statehood to hide FAILURES of his government . The power tussle started by Kejriwal has digressed Delhi causing irreparable loss to Delhi 's development . `` Dipankar Bhattacharya , CPI ( ML ) leader : `` Welcome vindication of the powers of an elected government in a federal framework .

UNITED NATIONS , July 4 ( APP ) : Intense air and ground-based strikes at multiple locations in Syria 's south-western
Daraa governorate has resulted in “ largest displacement ” in the area since the conflict began more than seven years ago , the United Nations refugee agency has reported .
A number of civilians are also reported to have been killed in the hostilities and many more injured , said Andrej Mahecic on Tuesday , a spokesperson for the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees ( UNHCR ) .
He said the agency was “ deeply concerned by the escalation of fighting ” and called on those involved “ to take all necessary measures to safeguard civilian lives , protect civilian infrastructure and allow freedom of movement as required under international humanitarian and human rights laws . ”
Among those displaced by the fighting “ estimated to number between 270,000 to 330,000 are some 60,000 ” at the Nasib/Jaber border crossing , between Syria and Jordan , forced to live with sweltering heat , pounded by dusty desert winds .
According to reports , at least 12 children , two women , and one elderly man , have died in the past few days close to the Jordanian border due to scorpion bites , dehydration and disease .
Elizabeth Throssell , a spokesperson for the Office of UN High Commissioner for Human Rights ( OHCHR ) , appealed for the safety of those trapped at the border .
She also called on all parties involved in the conflict to “ ensure safe , sustained and unimpeded humanitarian access to those in need , in line with their obligations under international law. ” We call on the international community , in particular countries of the region with the financial ability to host large numbers of refugees , to take in fleeing civilians from Syria … We call on the Jordanian Government to keep its border open and for other countries in the region to step up and receive the fleeing civilians . ”
UN agencies on the ground are preparing to scale up their response , prioritizing life-saving assistance and protection services for those with emergency needs .
The World Food Programme ( WFP ) , the organization 's emergency food and nutrition relief agency , has delivered enough food for around 200,000 people and stands ready to deliver more as soon as security improves and conditions allow .
However , violence has also displaced hundreds of staff of WFP-partner organizations , “ leaving few people on the ground to manage aid distribution and limiting possibilities to intervene , ” said Bettina Luescher , a spokesperson for the UN agency . She added that “ other However , violence has also displaced hundreds of staff of WFP-partner organizations , “ leaving few people on the ground to manage aid distribution and limiting possibilities to intervene , ” Bettina Luescher , a spokesperson for the UN agency , said .

He is considered one of the greatest rappers in hip hop history , but Tupac Shakur 's career came to a tragic end when he was murdered in a drive-by shooting in 1996.Despite the myriad of conspiracy theories and attempts to solve the case of his murder , the identity of the gunman that took Tupac 's life has remained a mystery for 22 years.While filming the 10-part Netflix docuseries 'Unsolved , the Tupac and Biggie Murders ' , Keefe D revealed it was his nephew that pulled the trigger.Keefe D , who made the bombshell confession during a taped conversation under immunity , said he was in the car when Orlando 'Baby Lane ' Anderson opened fire.Tupac , who was 25 at the time , was shot four times in the chest on September 7 , 1996 while he was in Las Vegas . He died on September 13.Problems began that day when Anderson tried to steal a Death Row Records medallion from a member of Tupac 's entourage - which was affiliated with LA gang The Bloods.Tupac and his entourage then beat up Anderson at the MGM Grand later that night after watching a Mike Tyson fight.And after the fight , they were out for revenge.Davis revealed in the Netflix docuseries that they hopped into their Cadillac to find Tupac after the beat down , knowing he was due to perform at 662 Clubs that night.There were four people in the car : Terrence 'T-Brown ' Brown behind the wheel , Keefe D in the front passenger seat , plus Anderson and DeAndre 'Dre ' Smith in the back.The group bought booze and waited for the rapper to show up.Soon they heard the clamor of girls screaming 'Tupac ! ' and they knew the rapper had arrived . 'All the chicks was like `` Tupac ! `` , and he was like `` Hey '' like a celebrity , like he was in a parade , ' Keefe D recalled . 'If he would n't even have been out the window we would never have seen him . 'Keefe D said Brown then 'bust a U-turn ' and their car pulled up next to Tupac , who was riding in the front passenger seat of his BMW alongside Suge Knight.That 's when the violence unfolded . ' I gave it to Dre and Dre was like ' '' no , no , no '' and Lane was like - popped the dudes , ' Keefe D said in the taped confession in the documentary . 'He leaned over and rolled down the window and popped them . 'Speaking months ago before the Netflix show , in a separate documentary titled 'Death Row Chronicles ' , Keefe D revealed he is ill and wanted to finally tell the world what happened on that sad September night . ' I was a Compton kingpin , drug dealer , I 'm the only one alive who can really tell you story about the Tupac killing , ' Keefe D said . 'People have been pursuing me for 20 years , I 'm coming out now because I have cancer . And I have nothing else to lose . All I care about now is the truth . '' It just came from the backseat bro , ' he added.But now Keefe D has finally revealed it was Anderson , sitting in the backseat just as he said , who ultimately pulled the trigger.Anderson , who always denied he murdered Tupac , was killed in a shootout in Los Angeles two years later.Kyle Long , the executive producer of Unsolved , is now calling for the Las Vegas police department to pursue Keefe D , according to the Daily Star 'He went live on television and confessed to being an accessory to murder and the Las Vegas PD , as far as I know , is doing nothing about it , ' said Long . ' I just think it 's outrageous . 'Keefe D 's confession seems to put an end to the numerous theories that have swirled around Tupac 's death for more than two decades.Many had blamed fellow rapper the Notorious B.I.G , also known as Biggie Smalls , and the infamous East Coast/West Coast rivalry between their record labels.Others believed it was really Knight , then the CEO of Death Row Records , who was supposed to die that night.Some even claimed it was Knight himself who had put a hit on Tupac.But , in the end , it all came down to gang rivalry . 'It was simple retaliation , ' an LAPD insider told People . 'You mess with one of ours , we will mess with one of yours . 'If Orlando had never been jumped in the hotel , they never would have killed Tupac that night . 'While Tupac 's death has long remained a mystery , some have always believed that both he and Knight knew who was responsible.When a police officer asked Tupac who pulled the trigger , the rapper simply replied ' F * * k you ' as he lay bleeding on the Las Vegas Strip.Some have theorized that Tupac , who had survived a shooting just two years before , thought he would live to see the day he could get revenge his own way . 'My belief is they both knew , ' Dan Long , a Las Vegas Police Department detective , told People . 'The cars were two or three feet apart when the shooting occurred . Tupac was the passenger and he would have been right up against him in an extremely well-lit part of town . 'No one has ever been charged in Tupac 's death .

ISLAMABAD - The CPEC project ( China-Pakistan Economic Corridor ) is significant for Azerbaijan , due to fact that thanks to this project Azerbaijan can export goods to China .
Ambassador of Pakistan to Azerbaijan Sajid Khan Mohmand said that the goods can be sent to China from Astrakhan via Azerbaijan , Iran and Pakistan .
`` We are also expanding the main seaport of Gwadar . By 2025 , the port can accept more and more large vessels , and there are transport corridors within the Lapis Lazuli project and the Ashgabat agreement that connect Azerbaijan with Pakistan and Central Asia , all of which can be of great importance for Azerbaijan , '' the ambassador was quoted as saying by Azerbaijani newspaper `` AzerNews '' on Tuesday .
CPEC is a collection of infrastructure projects that are currently under construction throughout Pakistan . Originally valued at $ 46 billion , the value of CPEC projects is now worth $ 62 billion .
CPEC is intended to rapidly modernize Pakistani infrastructure and strengthen its economy by the construction of modern transportation networks , numerous energy projects , and special economic zones . Trade and economic contacts occupy a significant place in bilateral relations between China and Azerbaijan .
The process of interaction between the two countries was marked by constant tendencies of expansion and strengthening of cooperation .
The cooperation between China and Azerbaijan strongly contributes to the realization of the Great Silk road program .
China became Azerbaijan 's 4th largest trading partner in 2017 . Customs data of Azerbaijan estimated bilateral trade at a record close to $ 1.3 billion in 2017 , up 33 percent from the previous year . Exports of Azerbaijani goods amounted to $ 433.8 million ( 3.21 percent of total exports ) , while imports of Chinese products to Azerbaijan reached $ 854.5 million ( 9.73 percent of total imports ) .
This morning , an Eater article with more than 60 sources revealed four separate allegations of sexual misconduct against chef Mario Batali , restauranteur and co-host of ABC 's The Chew . Accounts from those who came forward include multiple allegations of groping and forced contact . In response , Batali is stepping away from the day-to-day operations of his many businesses , as well as his gig on The Chew .
“ I apologize to the people I have mistreated and hurt , ” Batali said in a statement . “ Although the identities of most of the individuals mentioned in these stories have not been revealed to me , much of the behavior described does , in fact , match up with ways I have acted . That behavior was wrong and there are no excuses . I take full responsibility and am deeply sorry for any pain , humiliation or discomfort I have caused to my peers , employees , customers , friends and family . ”
Though he seems contrite , none of the women have revealed their identities out of fear of retaliation . One former employee of Batali 's says the chef has a history of intimidating behavior . “ He has clear intent on being threatening when he is wronged . And the level of vindictiveness is very chilling . So , it never occurred to me to share tales out of school . ”
Batali was reprimanded for inappropriate behavior by his company , Batali & Bastianich Hospitality Group , just two months ago , though the article notes that it was the first formal complaint against the chef . His behavior , however , was written about in Bill Buford 's 2006 book , Heat , in which Batali harrassed a female server at one of his New York City restaurants . “ It 's not fair I have this view all to myself when you bend over , ” he said . “ For dessert , would you take off your blouse for the others ? ”
Chatter regarding harassment allegations against a famous chef began circulating on Twitter night , with Anthony Bourdain himself stoking the flames .
According to three sources , a famous chef will be the subject of a story about allegations of sexual misconduct…likely out tomorrow . — Yashar Ali 🐘 ( @ yashar ) December 11 , 2017
No . Trust me . Monday is really gon na suck . — Anthony Bourdain ( @ Bourdain ) December 11 , 2017
There was much speculation as to who the chef in question would be , but among those in the industry , apparently , it was a no-brainer .
And no one should be surprised https : //t.co/DCLvDzNYwO — Tom Colicchio ( @ tomcolicchio ) December 11 , 2017
“ I know my actions have disappointed many people , ” Batali continued in his statement . “ The successes I have enjoyed are owned by everyone on my team . The failures are mine alone . To the people who have been at my side during this time — my family , my partners , my employees , my friends , my fans — I am grateful for your support and hopeful that I can regain your respect and trust . I will spend the next period of time trying to do that . ”
A recent article by SportsNet columnist Mark Spector pointed out something very interesting about young defenceman Darnell Nurse that is worth noting . When asked what type of defenceman Nurse believes he could become in his wildest dreams , he answered the question with undoubtedly one of the best answers anyone could ever give to a question of that nature .
“ I do n't have dreams . I have goals . ”
It 's an answer that wraps up what Nurse has become for the Edmonton Oilers in one sentence . The still-young blueliner has taken on loads more responsibility this season and in a year that has been anything but positive for the Oilers ' franchise , Nurse might be the one shining light . He 's become arguably the second-most important piece ( Connor McDavid being the first ) on the Oilers ' roster and his attitude and poise at a young age may be a large reason for his success .
Developing at Nurse 's Pace
Spector also correctly points out that Nurse is developing at a pace that works for Darnell Nurse . A seventh-overall draft pick in 2013 , it 's taken Nurse a few seasons to really grow into his own . Perhaps fans of the Oilers had hoped he 'd have impacted the game on a more significant level earlier in his career , but not all defensemen are Drew Doughty or Victor Hedman . Strong defenders often take time and Nurse needing a few seasons to get used to the speed of the NHL is n't terribly abnormal .
That said , this season , he 's been eating minutes like PacMan and used in all situations . He 's averaging over 21 minutes per game , has six goals and 18 points and is seeing time on special teams in an effort to turn a horrid penalty kill and power play around . He leads the team in plus-minus and has produced more offensively than any other Oilers ' defender .
Some would suggest he 's been the Oilers the best defenseman this season by a mile .

Future No . 1 Defender ?
The question is , does Nurse 's results this season mean he 'll one day be a No . 1 ?
Coming into the 2017-18 season , few expected Nurse to be the difference-maker on the Oilers . Oscar Klefbom and Adam Larsson both played unbelievably well the previous season , but neither has been able to refind the magic that helped lead the team to their first playoff appearance in over a decade .
So too , Andrej Sekera has n't rebounded from his injury the way the Oilers might have hoped and as a result , a large load has been placed upon Nurse 's shoulders . He 's carried it well . Moved up to the first pairing on a regular basis , Nurse has been asked to lead the way in many ways . He 's jumping up in the rush but adding sound defensive play , and his decision-making has improved tremendously .
“ In an ugly year for our hockey club he 's having a pretty solid individual year , ” said head coach Todd McLellan . “ His game has n't wavered much from night to night regardless of how the group is playing . He 's an evolving young defenceman in our organization , obviously something we need . If we can keep his confidence level up we feel we have a good one . ”

Goals , Not Dreams
There 's nothing wrong with being a dreamer . But , Nurse has the right idea here when he says he has goals and not dreams . The Oilers wo n't get back into contention by dreaming they can . This is n't The Secret and the “ Law of Attraction ” wo n't cut it here . Setting smaller goals that eventually become bigger goals signifies the team is willing to chip away at their deficit in the standings a little bit at a time .
Nurse has done the same with his career . He wanted to be seen as a trusted defenseman who could play a well-rounded game . He wanted to be known as a teammate who would stand up for his players . He wanted to be counted on to produce offensively . He wanted his coaches to know he could play relatively mistake-free hockey . At every turn and with each objective , Nurse has taken things one step at a time .
Setting goals are how Nurse has achieved and succeeded when others have faltered . And , he 's not done . He believes he 's only scratched the surface of what he 's able to offer the Oilers and there are plenty of goals left to achieve . Fans are hoping he 's right .
The Edmonton Oilers need to tear a page out of Nurse 's playbook . With 32 games left in the season , there 's still time , but not much . The Edmonton Oilers need to have goals and not dreams of making it to the playoffs this season . But to do so , means winning one game at a time , then a run of games , then a massive winning streak . Anything less than that means the Oilers season is toast .

It 's hard to believe that Sir Stirling Moss never claimed an overall title , but he certainly claimed all sorts of other motorsport victories before his retirement at 88 . Moss won major races at nearly every level of competition during his racing days , including Le Mans , Sebring , the Mille Miglia , Monte Carlo , and a number of Formula One grands prix races . One of the cars Stirling piloted during his career is this gorgeous road-racing Jaguar E-Type . If you like it , you should say so with your wallet because the car is now for sale .
This E-Type Roadster was transformed into a race car at the hands of Jaguar expert Jeremy Broad , according to AutoClassics . To complete this transition , Broad utilized a number of parts found on the amazing E-Type Lightweight cars . Under the hood sits a full race-spec 4.2-liter inline straight-6 . It 's backed up by a 5-speed Getrag manual .
H & H Classics of England will auction off this 1965 E-Type on June 5 . Pre-auction estimates peg the value somewhere between $ 145,000 and $ 170,000 . That almost seems a bit low to us . Sure , the car is n't known as a highlight race winner , but it was piloted by Sir Stirling Moss , and it 's constructed in a similar fashion as the colossally collectible and expensive E-Type Lightweights .
In January 2017 , a 1963 E-Type Lightweight earned $ 7,370,000 at a Bonhams auction . Just 12 original Lightweight cars were built , so the excitement and price make ( some ) sense . This Moss-raced car is n't in the same league , of course , but it does have sentimental value for any well-heeled motorsport lover . Furthermore , we would n't be surprised if the car is invited to compete in all manner of vintage road racing events .
If a smart collector can pick this up for under $ 200,000 , they could have quite a healthy investment machine in their midst . Plus , it 's one they could drive now in those vintage races and garner ever more interest and attention for a future sale .
OTTAWA—Liberal Jean Yip declared victory to keep the Scarborough-Agincourt riding in the family Monday night , with a win in a seven-person field . The Liberals were on track to retain a second safe seat and the Conservatives on course to hang onto a safe seat of their own in three of four federal byelections held Monday . The Scarborough-Agincourt riding was left vacant by the death of Yip 's husband , Arnold Chan , of cancer in September . Her nearest competitor was banker Dasong Zou , running for the Conservatives . But the outcome was widely expected : the Liberals have held Scarborough-Agincourt for three decades . “ I 'm happy and I know Arnold would be happy with the kind of campaign we ran , ” Yip said . “ I 'm never going to stop meeting the residents of Scarborough-Agincourt . I 'll continue to knock on their door , hear their concerns , and work very hard for them in the constituency , as well as in Ottawa . ”

Chan had held the seat for only six months when his cancer diagnosis was made in 2014 . He underwent radiation and chemotherapy , but in March 2016 , the cancer was back . He lived another 18 months . Yip said her first priority would be to seek federal funds for the Bridletowne Community Hub and funding for senior spaces and youth programs . This byelection would not be a one-off , she promised . “ I plan to run again . You do n't put in this hard work and say ‘ thanks very much . ' I am totally committed to representing the residents of Scarborough-Agincourt . I do n't do things half way . ”
In Newfoundland and Labrador , the Liberals easily retained Bonavista-Burin-Trinity , the safest Liberal seat in the country . With all polls reporting , Liberal Churence Rogers captured 69.2 per cent of the vote — 46 percentage points ahead of his nearest competitor , Conservative Mike Windsor , who nevertheless managed to double his share of the vote from the 2015 general election . Read more : Jean Yip to vie for late husband Arnold Chan 's seat Trudeau pays tribute at funeral for Liberal MP Arnold Chan Judy Foote resigns cabinet to help family face cancer As impressive as Roger 's margin of victory was , he did not meet the standard set by his popular Liberal predecessor , Judy Foote , who retired from cabinet and federal politics citing family health concerns . She won the strongest majority in the country during the 2015 election , taking a whopping 81.8 per cent of the vote . With 90 of 138 polls reporting in the safe Tory riding of Battlefords-Lloydminster in Saskatchewan , Conservative Rosemarie Falk enjoyed a commanding lead with 68.8 per cent of the vote , more than 50 points ahead of any of her competitors . Battlefords-Lloydminster was left vacant following the retirement of veteran Conservative MP Gerry Ritz , who had held the riding for 20 years . The B.C . contest was the only one where the seat could change hands . Results were just starting to trickle in the one riding — British Columbia 's South Surrey—White Rock — where the Liberals were hoping to score an upset over the Conservatives . With 75 of 199 polls reporting , that contest was still too close to call . Liberal contender Gordie Hogg had an early lead with 47 per cent of the vote , just five percentage points ahead of Conservative Kerry-Lynne Findlay , a former Harper-era cabinet minister who represented a neighbouring riding for one term before being defeated in 2015 . South Surrey—White Rock was left vacant after Conservative MP Diane Watts resigned to run for the leadership of the B.C . Liberals . Watts , a high-profile former mayor of Surrey , narrowly won the seat in 2015 with 44 per cent of the vote , less than 1,500 votes ahead of the Liberal contender . This time , the Liberals are running Hogg , a former White Rock mayor and B.C . MLA , against Conservative Kerry-Lynne Findlay , a former Harper-era cabinet minister who represented a neighbouring riding for one term before being defeated in the 2015 election . Should Hogg prevail , it would be the second byelection loss in as many months for newly minted Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer . The four byelections mark the second electoral test for the newly minted leaders of the Conservative and New Democratic parties , Scheer and Jagmeet Singh . Neither fared particularly well in their first test . In October , the Liberals scored a stunning upset in a byelection in Quebec 's nationalist heartland , stealing the riding of Lac-Saint-Jean away from the Tories . The NDP , which had come a close second in the riding in 2015 , wound up a distant fourth . At the same time , Scheer found some consolation in another byelection in an Edmonton Tory stronghold , easily hanging onto Sturgeon River—Parkland with an increased share of the vote , while both the Liberals and NDP saw their vote share decline slightly .

Iran Focus
London , 9 Dec - The Iranian Regime has voiced their support for the assassination of former Yemeni president Ali Abdullah Saleh , indicating that their expansionist tendencies in the Middle East enjoy the support of all Regime members .
Iran regime 's president Hassan Rouhani , the chief commander of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps ( IRGC ) Mohammed Ali Jafari , and the editor-in-chief of Kayhan , a newspaper close to Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei , all condoned the December 4 assassination , which was carried out by the Iranian-backed Houthi terrorist group .
Jafari even said that he saw Saleh 's assassination as a step towards fulfilling the goals of the Regime 's 1979 takeover of Iran .
He told Tasnim , a news agency close to the IRGC : “ Iran 's allies in Syria , Yemen and Bahrain have taken inspiration from the experiment of the Iranian revolution . ”
He even claimed that this foiled a plot against the Houthis , citing Saleh 's plans to reach out to the Saudi-led coalition for talks .
While Ali Akbar Velayati , a close ally of Khamenei , and Rouhani both painted this as a victory for the people of Yemen .
Velayati said : “ The Saudi Emirati conspiracy ( after the Saleh assassination ) has failed in Yemen . The Yemeni people have resisted for two years Saudi barbaric bombing . ”
Rouhani said : “ The dedicated people of Yemen will make aggressors regret their actions . ”
Of course , they failed to note that the Yemeni people vastly do not support the Houthis , who they see as Iranian puppets , and that there would be no Saudi-led coalition to support the internationally-recognised government had the Houthis not seized power .
Geneive Abdo , an Iran expert , wrote on National Interest that this instance showed a departure from normality within the Regime 's ranks as generally some members of the Regime- wrongly labelled moderates by the West- show a more measured response .
Abdo wrote : “ In the past , the president and foreign minister generally offered more measured opinions and reactions on issues regarding violence and extremism associated with Iran and its proxies in the Middle East . But a combination of factors converging at the same time has shifted Iran 's posture . The regime has chosen to put forward a united front and no longer believes it is in its interest to either downplay its support for Shia militias and societies in the region or to renounce violence that works to its strategic advantage . ”
Of course , it is important to note that the measured responses were really just acting as a mask to trick democratic governments into working with them . It 's the good-cop , bad-cop routine but where both the cops would kill you if they got the chance .
The abandonment of this routine is likely a result of changing global attitude to the Regime- what 's the point in pretending like you can play nice if everyone else sees through you ?
Other factors include the worrying potential victory of Iran ally Bashar al-Assad in Syria ( whose dictatorship has been propped up by Iranian proxies for over seven years now ) , and the perceived victories against Saudi Arabia in proxy wars in Lebanon , Yemen , Syria and Iraq .
This destabilisation of the Middle East- mainly as a direct result of Iran 's policies- has certainly worked to the Regime 's advantage .
NEW YORK ( AP ) — A pipe bomb that was strapped to a man went off in the New York City subway near the Times Square area of Manhattan on Monday , injuring the suspect and another person on the platform at the height of the morning rush hour , law enforcement officials said .
The person on the platform was being treated for non-life-threatening injuries .

The officials spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the incident .
The explosion , which happened around 7:30 a.m. , triggered a massive emergency response by New York police and fire both above and below ground , tangling subway and bus service at the nearby Port Authority bus terminal .
White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders has tweeted that President Trump has been briefed on the explosion .
Video from above the “ Crossroads of the World ” showed lines of police and emergency vehicles , their lights flashing , lining the streets and no other vehicle traffic moving .
Everything around the Port Authority in the 42nd Street area was shut down — a surreal scene of still at what would ordinarily be a bustling rush hour .

`` The sell-off was around the North Korea risk and escalating rhetoric . It seems to have died down a bit now , '' said Caroline Simmons , deputy head of the UK investment office at UBS Wealth Management .
`` This week we 're seeing a return to fundamentals which are quite good , '' Simmons said . `` ( Company ) earnings have been in line or slightly above expectations , global growth seems OK . ''
Last week 's equity losses - and yen gains - were sparked by a war of words between Pyongyang and Washington after U.S. President Donald Trump warned North Korea it would face `` fire and fury '' if it threatened the United States .
That prompted North Korea to say it was considering plans to fire missiles at the U.S.-held Pacific island of Guam .
While North Korea 's Liberation Day celebration on Tuesday to mark the end of Japanese rule could see tensions rise again , markets are relieved that the weekend passed without more rhetoric . U.S. officials also played down the likelihood of a nuclear conflict with North Korea .
Tokyo shares failed to partake in the region 's gains however , slipping 1 percent to three-month lows .N225 even after data showing robust 1.0 percent second quarter growth in Japan , the sixth straight quarter of expansion .
That was due to worries over the potential impact of the yen 's recent surge against the dollar . .N225 . The Japanese currency , which firmed around 1.4 percent last week , tends to benefit during times of geopolitical or financial stress as Japan is the world 's biggest creditor nation .
Japanese investors also repatriated cash held overseas .
The greenback rose 0.5 percent to 109.70 yen JPY= after slipping to 108.720 on Friday , its weakest since April 20 . Against a basket of currencies it firmed 0.2 percent , rising off last week 's 10-day lows .DXY .
It also firmed 0.6 percent against the Swiss franc , another currency which is favored during times of stress and touched two-week highs last week CHF= .
`` Easing regional geopolitical tensions are taking a toll on the yen , with the currency being the key underperformer ( along with safe haven peer Swiss franc ) globally , '' ING Bank analysts told clients .
`` As long as the geopolitics ease , we look for dollar/yen to gradually grind higher along with gently higher U.S . yields . ''
RECOVERING ECONOMY
The Japanese data was interpreted by some as another sign that the global economy is indeed on the mend , with possible consequences for central banks ' easy-credit policies .
While Japan is not expected to dismantle its stimulus program any time soon , analysts reckon that signs of global recovery gives euro zone and U.S. central banks a reason to start rolling back some of their asset purchases .
The data helped push U.S. 10-year yields US10YT=RR higher from Friday 's six-week lows , touched after showing that U.S. consumer prices rose just 0.1 percent last month , below economists ' forecast of a 0.2 percent gain .
The yield on Germany 's 10-year government bond DE10YT=TWEB , the benchmark for the euro zone , was up 3.8 bps to 0.42 percent , a move mirrored by most other euro zone debt . The yield had hit the lowest since end-June on Friday .
`` The question becomes how Japanese growth could impact the very expansionary stance of central banks , '' said Daniel Lenz , a strategist at DZ Bank .
Markets could glean some clues on that from minutes of the latest U.S. Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank meetings , due on Wednesday and Thursday respectively .
Earlier in the day , Chinese markets were largely unfazed by a slew of activity data which was softer than forecast , though still largely solid .
The world 's second-largest economy had been widely expected to lose some steam after a surprisingly strong first half of 2017 . But economists do not expect a hard landing , with the government keen to ensure stability ahead of a Communist Party leadership reshuffle in the autumn .
However , the weak Chinese data hit oil prices , with Brent crude futures LCOc1 down 42 cents at $ 51.68 a barrel .

The former Aston Villa defender misses three games as a result and Lee Johnson could look to reshuffle at the back .
Callum O'Dowda , Milan Djuric , Eros Pisano , Gary O'Neil , Jens Hegeler and Matty Taylor are all unavailable due to injury , while Johnson has the likes of Lois Diony - the loanee signing from St Etienne - to showcase further after his decent cameo against QPR .
City currently sit fifth in the table ahead the Bolton game and a win would shift them up to third if only until Saturday when the likes of Cardiff , Aston Villa and Derby County all play .

Barcelona deny buying Abidal illegal transplant liver
Barcelona , Jul 4 ( AFP ) Barcelona denied today that they illegally bought a transplant liver for their former defender Eric Abidal .
Contacted by AFP , a Barcelona court said it had investigated a possible crime of organ trafficking for more than a year before deciding not to proceed because of a lack of evidence .
`` FC Barcelona roundly deny any irregularity in the matter , '' the club said in a statement in English on their website .
Abidal , a former France international , received a liver transplant in April 2012 at the Hospital Clinic in Barcelona and resumed his playing career a year later before retiring in 2014 .
On Wednesday morning , online newspaper El Confidencial reported that a telephone tap of former club president Sandro Rosell , suggested that the club illegally acquired a liver for the player .
Rossell is due to face trial on charges of money laundering in connection with Brazilian TV rights sales and was also investigated for the deal which brought Neymar to Barcelona . Abidal , who is 38 , was named Barcelona 's sport director in June .
`` The club are saddened by the lack of rigour in the spreading of such information about such a sensitive issue , '' said the Barcelona statement .
The clinic and the Spanish organ donation organisation ( ONT ) both issued statements denying any wrong-doing , although ONT added that it had opened an internal investigation

Statistics show more than 40 per cent of Coffs locals rent
Statistics show more than 40 per cent of Coffs locals rent monkeybusinessimages
WETHER by choice or not , a vast section of the Coffs Coast rent their homes . In some areas as many as two out of every five locals are living in rental accommodation .
CoreLogic Market Trends show 40.3 per cent of Coffs Harbour city 's population rents their home .
At the opposite end of the scale , almost one-third of Coffs locals own their home outright and just under a quarter own with a mortgage .
The 40.3 per cent result for the city is the highest rate of renters anywhere on the Coffs Coast .
Toormina has the second highest rental rate of 36 per cent , followed by Nambucca Heads at 34.9 per cent and Sawtell at 33.4 per cent .
The reasons for these results vary .
Some are suburbs where rents are cheap and plentiful like Toormina , while suburbs like Sawtell are places where people want to live , but may not be able to afford to buy .
With so many renters , the rental market can become tough to crack when looking for a place to call home , but for the time being there is relief from what has been an incredibly tight rental market in recent times .
New figures show the rental squeeze on the Coffs Coast eased during the past month .
According to the monthly REINSW Survey , Coffs Harbour 's vacancy rate increased to 3.8 per cent in February , up from 2.5 per cent in January and 1.8 in December 2017 .
With so many renters in the market , the Coffs Coast remains a popular spot for property investors who can achieve strong returns on their investment , unlike some other markets .
The CoreLogic Market Trends show that in Coffs Harbour the gross rental yield for houses is 4.6 per cent and 5.2 per cent for units .
Rental hotspot Toormina offers a strong return of 4.9 per cent for houses and 5.8 for units .
Nambucca Heads returns a gross rental yield of 5.5 per cent for units and 4.9 per cent for houses .
The Coffs Coast 's strongest rental yields are 6.5 per cent for units at Sapphire Beach where the median sale price is a mere $ 288,500 .
Coffs Harbour 's highest rents are for Sapphire Beach houses at a median of $ 495 a week and the cheapest is $ 320 a week for Toormina units .
Of course , having no mortgage is the ultimate dream , and the vast majority of Arrawarra locals are already there - 77.1 per cent own their homes outright .
Mike Golic and Trey Wingo question how long Dolphins head coach Adam Gase has to turn around his Miami team before getting fired . ( 2:01 )
DAVIE , Fla. -- Assistant head coach and longtime special-teams coach Darren Rizzi has seen hundreds of players come and go during his eight seasons with the Miami Dolphins .
According to Rizzi , he has n't coached anyone quite like two-time Pro Bowl wide receiver Jarvis Landry .
“ He 's an unbelievable competitor , and no matter where I 've coached -- college and the NFL , this is my 25th season -- I do n't know if I can say I 've had a more competitive guy than Jarvis on game days , ” Rizzi said . “ He brings a lot of energy to the team , to the sideline . He 's really into the game . That 's really contagious . ”
Where does Landry get his competitiveness ?
“ Just growing up , I was always just taught to win , ” Landry said . “ Always compete to win . Never settle for second or less . I think it 's just always been will . I 've always believed and approached it with pure confidence and with the understanding and knowing that I wo n't quit until they do or he does . That 's got me through everything . ”
Dolphins receiver Jarvis Landry had eight catches for 70 yards two weeks ago against the Patriots despite facing constant double-teams -- which he 's likely to see again Monday night against New England . Adam Glanzman/Getty Images
Landry , who is making $ 893,850 this season , is one of the NFL 's biggest bargains . With 80 catches so far , he is well on his way to leading the Dolphins in receptions for the fourth consecutive season . Landry has also set an NFL record for the most receptions ( 368 ) in the first four seasons of a career and still has four games to go .
All of those skills will be on display on Monday Night Football ( 8:30 p.m . ET , ESPN ) when Landry leads Miami ( 5-7 ) against the defending Super Bowl champion New England Patriots ( 10-2 ) .
If the Dolphins have learned anything during this roller-coaster season , it 's that Landry is part of the long-term solution . He is arguably the team 's most consistent player and on pace to surpass 100 receptions for the second time in his career .
Landry will become an unrestricted free agent in March , and the Dolphins would be foolish to let him walk . Landry certainly wo n't come cheaply . Receivers with his level of production could make anywhere between $ 12 million and $ 17 million per season .
But the Dolphins must find a way to keep one of their pillars or risk taking a further step back . In addition to his team-leading 80 receptions , Landry has 699 receiving yards and six touchdowns despite a revolving door of quarterbacks that began with Ryan Tannehill in training camp and continued with Jay Cutler and Matt Moore during the season .

Entering a contract year , Landry worked hard on shaking the label of slot receiver and has run more outside routes .
“ We had a big emphasis of it this offseason where I know he always wants to do more and wants to be put in different spots , ” Dolphins coach Adam Gase said . “ He 's done a good job of learning all those different positions . We 're just going to keep trying to find ways to get him the ball and get it in his hands quickly so he can make some plays after he catches the ball . ”
Monday presents an opportunity for a national audience to see Landry against one of the NFL 's best and smartest teams . Despite facing constant double-teams , he had eight receptions for 70 yards two weeks ago in a 35-17 loss to the Patriots .
Patriots coach Bill Belichick was seen on video via NFL Films saying how important it was to double Landry throughout the game . That shows just how much respect the future Hall of Fame coach has for Landry .
The Dolphins expect to see more of the same Monday night since the strategy worked .
“ They 're going to double Jarvis . They 're going to take away what you 're doing well and make you try to beat them left-handed , ” Dolphins offensive coordinator Clyde Christensen said . “ That 's what they 've always done , and they do it in a lot of different ways so you never have a beat going into the game . ”
Perhaps the biggest error Landry made this year happened in the offseason .
Landry made a bold prediction in April that the Dolphins would sweep the Patriots and close the gap in the AFC East . New England already foiled that proclamation and has a chance sweep Miami for the second straight season .
Landry realizes it will take a near-perfect game by Miami 's offense on Monday night to split the season series .
“ They are a good team . They 're a great team , ” Landry said of the Patriots . “ You ca n't have turnovers and you ca n't play behind the chains against these guys . They 'll make you pay for it . Also , we had opportunities there to take that game from them . For us , we 're trying to put another game together , one at a time . ”
It will forever be known as the `` Lap of the Gods '' .
Yet Greg Murphy 's legendary 2003 Bathurst 1000 time would have finished second-last in Friday 's qualifying after Scott McLaughlin led an assault on the Mount Panorama record books .
Series leader McLaughlin sent an ominous warning when he clocked the fastest-ever lap in a Supercar at Mount Panorama - a scorching two minutes , 04.14 seconds - in Friday 's final practice before qualifying .
He obliterated Holden great Jamie Whincup 's 2015 mark by a whopping 0.76 of a second .
McLaughlin vowed to do it again in qualifying .
In the end he fell an agonising 0.08 of a second short ( 2:04.22 ) of his mark but still emerged as the driver to stop in Sunday 's Great Race by grabbing provisional pole .
McLaughlin 's DJR Team Penske 's race engineer Ludo Lacroix went nuts in the garage after the Ford ace registered the record mark .
The rest of the pit lane dropped their shoulders after looking up at the timesheets and there was little wonder why .
To put McLaughlin 's achievement in perspective , it is best to turn to fellow Kiwi Murphy 's landmark time 14 years ago that has gone down in Bathurst folklore .
Murphy may be a four-time King of the Mountain but he will always be remembered for that lap .
He clocked a new lap record of 2:06.85 in a single flying lap in the Top 10 Shootout to stun the Bathurst crowd .
Murphy 's milestone is still much adored by the Supercars faithful despite being left behind after six-time Bathurst champ Craig Lowndes first eclipsed it in 2010 on a resurfaced Mount Panorama .
But McLaughlin did his best to ensure it may become a distant memory after his scorching practice effort .
All but one of the 26-strong field went faster than Murphy 's famous lap in Friday 's qualifying .
McLaughlin , 24 , now has a maiden Bathurst title - and perhaps another record - in his sights after topping qualifying ahead of Holden cult hero David Reynolds ( 2:04.47 ) and Ford star Chaz Mostert ( 2:04.53 ) .
McLaughlin admitted the portents were good for a record assault on Friday after watching a support category scorch the track in overcast conditions .
But the master of understatement admits he was surprised after looking at the time as the Bathurst crowd erupted .
`` Looking at the ( support category ) Dunlop race before practice I knew the pace would be pretty decent , pretty fast , '' McLaughlin said .
`` But it ( record time ) was a bit better than we thought . ''
And he did n't rule out the prospect of shattering the 2:03.00 barrier if everything had clicked on Friday .
`` Maybe . But if I could tell the future I would be rich , '' McLaughlin said .
No one is ruling out another record plunge by McLaughlin in Saturday 's Top 10 Shootout , especially after hearing how he would approach it .
`` Have a go , '' he said .
`` The car is really good so we will try to make the most of it . ''
Michigan State guard Miles Bridges ( 22 ) and forward Gavin Schilling walk off the court after the team lost to Syracuse 55-53 in a second round game in the NCAA college basketball tournament , Sunday in Detroit . Carlos Osorio  The Associated Press
DETROIT > > Tom Izzo walked into his final news conference before a game this season and saw Michigan States interim president conducting interviews .
The Hall of Fame coach sat down and gazed toward the back of the room , essentially expressionless , as John Engler was with a handful of reporters .
Izzo had plenty on his plate at the time , trying to prepare the third-seeded Spartans for Syracuse . Izzo wasnt particularly concerned with the conversations Engler was having with a handful of reporters and said he wasnt bothered by it , figuring he was there to show his support .
But it was another sign , showing the crisis on campus related to Larry Nassar has affected Izzo and his basketball program . And perhaps the next sign played out for all to see on Sunday afternoon when the 11th-seeded Syracuse eliminated Michigan State with a 55-53 win in the second round of the NCAA Tournament on Sunday .

The toll of the turbulent season likely led to Izzo tearing up as he talked about perhaps the toughest season of his career when it seemed set up to potentially end with his second national championship .
While an ESPN report raised questions about how Izzo and Michigan State football coach handled sexual assault allegations within their program , their faces were on display on a TV set alongside Nassar , a former doctor at the school , who was sentenced to decades in prison for molesting young women and girls under the guise of medical treatment .
As part of the fallout , Lou Anna Simon resigned as school president and Mark Hollis , who is very close to Izzo , retired .
Izzo felt compelled to tell his team before a game he wasnt going anywhere as questions swirled about who might also be caught up in the wake of the scandal .
Instead of being frank at news conferences , Izzo repeatedly said he always cooperated with investigations and always would relate to allegations made against his players . He would grit his teeth and stayed largely silent when pressed with non-basketball questions at postgame news conferences .
The usually frank coach appeared to be in a no-win situation , getting criticized for not addressing allegations made in ESPN reporting and knowing he probably wouldnt have all the answers wanted if he did choose to say more .
Miles Bridges , meanwhile , went from being hailed for staying in school instead of making millions in the NBA to being ruled ineligible briefly before the final regular season game . The school found out his family had a meal with an agent last winter without his knowledge , committing an NCAA violation . Bridges was reinstated and bounced back to play well at times , but the pressure of performing and the off-the-court issues may have had something to do with him missing 14 of 18 shots against the Orange .
Everything that was thrown at us , we still had fun ,  Bridges said after what was likely his last college game . And , I love every guy thats on my team . Thats why Im so hurt right now.
Freshman Jaren Jackson is projected to be a high pick  even before Bridges  if he chooses to leave college as expected .
The Spartans may have three juniors to depend on next season led by point guard Cassius Winston , shooting guard Joshua Langford and forward Nick Ward along with seniors Matt McQuaid and Kenny Goins . Xavier Tillman worked his way into the lineup as a freshman and next years class will have plenty of opportunities to play .
Michigan State signed five standouts in November : Six-foot point guard Foster Loyer , Michigans Mr. Basketball ; 6-10 forward Marcus Bingham Jr. , 6-7 forward Gabe Brown and 6-8 forward Thomas Kithier .
Izzo insisted he will be back for a 24th season as coach to help the school and community bounce back even though he could probably land an NBA job if he wanted one after turning down at least a couple offers to jump to the league in the past .
I took too many bullets this year not to be here ,  he said . So , Ill be here and well be back knocking to win a championship.
By this time next year , though , Michigan State may not be in the clear and the lingering effects could continue to carry over onto the basketball program . Between Michigan States NCAA Tournament games , Engler was talking to reporters about his desire to reach a financial settlement with Nassars victims , adding the passage of sweeping child abuse legislation in the state is interfering with the process . State Attorney General Bill Schuette is reviewing how Michigan State handled the allegations against Nassar and the candidate for governor said the investigation would put a bright light on every corner of the university .
Even though his title is basketball coach , Izzo is a leader on campus and vows to stay to help it heal .
If somebody would give me a chance to bring Michigan State back , I cant think of anything I would rather do ,  Izzo said . I think its been punched and kicked . Some of it for mistakes , rightfully so . Some of them , not rightfully so . Im going to be hopefully part of the solution , not part of the problem.
Claxton High School will release at 12:15 on Friday in preparation for homecoming themed , “ Walk on the Wild Side ” this year . The parade will begin at 2:30 p.m. with line up at 1:30 p.m. From lineup on Clark Street , the parade will turn left on Hwy . 280 , left on Church Street , left on Rosemary to Goodge Street and back to the high school on Clark .
A pep rally is set for 11:30 a.m. in the CHS gym on Friday . The homecoming dance will be held Saturday , Oct. 7 , at 7 p.m. in the gym as well .

Fire breaks out at Mexico 's top refinery , 9 people hurt
2017-06-15 07:04 | www.trend.az | 1
A major fire broke out at Mexican state oil producer Pemex 's Salina Cruz refinery on Wednesday after a crude spill , injuring nine people and extending the shutdown of the plant into a second day , the company said , Reuters reported .
The blaze began in the pump house of Salina Cruz , Mexico 's largest refinery , on Wednesday morning , and the company was working to put it out , a Pemex spokeswoman said .
A Pemex spokesman said the fire had not yet reached the refinery 's nearby massive storage tanks , adding that efforts were under way to prevent that from happening .
Eight of the injured have been released from the hospital , the company said on its Twitter page .
Images sent by local emergency workers showed a tall , thick plume of black smoke spewing from towering flames at the refinery on the Pacific Coast in the southern state of Oaxaca .
An official at the Oaxaca state emergency services said some of the local neighborhoods near the refinery had been evacuated .
The fire occurred a day after heavy rains prompted the refinery to suspend operations and evacuate personnel .
Tropical Storm Calvin provoked flooding that busted though dams meant to contain a form of heavy oil , causing a spill that later ignited , the company statement said .
It added the blaze had been contained . However , it was unclear when operations might resume .
The refinery has a capacity of 330,000 barrels per day .
For over a year Pemex has been searching for investment partners to boost the aging facility 's productivity , but with no takers to date .
On Saturday Night , Vancouver-native Evander Kane joined CBC host Scott Oake on After Hours . Fresh after helping his Sharks claim victory 5-3 over the Canucks , Kane was fed question after question regarding his childhood in Vancouver , time with the Vancouver Giants , and even tweets referring to the possibility of him joining the team he grew up cheering for .
Kane , who recently had his first career four-goal performance , is up to 10 points in nine games with his new club . Acquired at the trade deadline from the Buffalo Sabres , the 6-foot-2 left winger is hoping to play in the playoffs for the first time in his career .
Is Kane a Fit ?
The 26-year-old will be an unrestricted free agent at the end of the season . He has garnered attention from the Canucks in the past , but the Sabres ' asking price was believed to be too much . With Daniel and Henrik Sedin 's contracts expiring come July 1 , there will be a huge void in Vancouver 's top-six forward group . There will be a plethora of cap space available for the Canucks this offseason , and Jim Benning has longed for more speed , size , and skill in the Canucks lineup . If there 's anything that the left winger is , it 's all of the above .
Fact is , Kane would immediately step in and become the best left-winger on the Canucks . As of today , he is third from the 2009 draft class in even-strength points , trailing only Matt Duchene and fellow UFA John Tavares . His 25 goals this season matches his total from last year , and is only five shorts of his career-high of 30 . For a team that again is among the league 's worst in putting pucks in the net , a player like Kane could be exactly what the Canucks need .
What About the Off-Ice Issues ?
Of course , it is n't Kane 's on-ice abilities that people question . As a matter of fact , Kane was basically exiled out of Winnipeg , with a timeline of indiscretions with the franchise that can make you shudder . Yes , he was talented , very young , and making millions in the NHL , but with his trade to the Sabres in February 2015 , there was hope that he was going to take the next step in his development . He has long been a vocal character on social media , and has definitely rubbed some people the wrong way . But after witnessing his one-on-one with Oake , it seems Kane has matured , and perhaps is ready to take on a larger role with a new team .
As a nine-year veteran in the NHL , Kane should be more than capable to become a locker-room kind of guy and big-time performer . Perhaps the best thing to happen to him is that he was traded to the Sharks at the trade deadline . In being surrounded by A-class veterans such as Joe Thornton , Joe Pavelski , Logan Couture and Brent Burns , Kane should be able to learn how to be a professional hockey player both on and off the ice .
Does It Make Sense to Sign Kane ?
At the moment , the Canucks have nine forwards signed in to next season , four restricted free agents , and five unrestricted free agents . That also does n't include some of the notable prospects waiting in the pipeline . Therefore , the Canucks should already have some competition up front for next season .
That being said , Kane is an affordable and skilled 26-year-old power forward who is coming into his prime .
The opportunity to add such a player does n't come by every day . Yes , some teams will be scared to acquire Kane 's services due to his reputation . For Kane , this could be a tremendous opportunity to prove people wrong and do it in his hometown , of all places .
Truthfully , the Canucks do need help up front . If the Sedin twins decide to retire , there are two massive openings in the top six forward groups , as well as on the top power-play unit . A guy like Kane would immediately bolster the team at even-strength , however , would not necessarily require the power play time to go with it . That massive opportunity could be given to another young player – say an Adam Gaudette or Elias Pettersson – if they are worthy of making the Canucks roster next fall .
The Verdict
I may take some heat for this , but I do believe Kane would be worth going for come July 1 . As mentioned earlier , to be able to acquire a 26-year-old top six forward via free agency is a rare opportunity to have . It 's not like chasing a certain 30-year-old named Loui Eriksson .
The bigger and more important point I have to make is it would take pressure off guys like Bo Horvat , Brock Boeser , and any other potential young guys to make the roster to try to score goals . If the Sedins retire , Kane should be capable of filling the void , as well as help answer any questions that the media may pose . Of course , that comes with a risk , but at this point for the Canucks , it may be a risk worth taking .

Virat Kohli lauds Mohammed Shami after a successful Test series against Sri Lanka
Virat Kohli was full of praise for the 27-year-old .
Shami in action
What 's the story ?
It seems as though Indian skipper , Virat Kohli , is in awe of his prime pace bowler , Mohammed Shami , as the Jonagar-born 27-year-old took three wickets in the second innings – and five in the match – to help India to an emphatic victory .
Kohli 's men absolutely razed the Sri Lankan batters as they could n't muster even 200 runs in any of the two innings that they batted on in the third Test . When asked about what he thought of Shami , Kohli showered praises on him .
“ I certainly rate him top three for sure because of his wicket-taking ability and the kind of impact he has on games . When he makes up his mind to come out and give it his 120 % , then he can bowl like this - 145 , 140 clicks on a regular basis and troubling the batsmen .
It is not just reckless bowling . So he is a quality bowler , he has all the ingredients of becoming a consistent world-class bowler , provided the fitness factor can be maintained and hopefully he is not hampered with any more injuries . ”
In case you did n't know ...
India played Sri Lanka in three Tests and won all of them in a comprehensive manner . While they won the first Test by 304 runs , they handed Sri Lanka embarrassing innings defeats in the next two Tests .
The details
And the Indian bowlers did a fabulous job at subduing the Lankans in their very own backyard , with Shami leading the pace attack with 10 wickets from three games .
Captain Kohli was adamant that Shami is a very valuable bowler for the team and that he is a joy to watch when he is in form before concluding that the 27-year-old is a very special bowler .
What 's next ?
India takes on the hosts in a 5-match ODI series that begins on the 20th of August at Dambulla . India are fully expected to continue their fine form and inflict further torment on a much-maligned Sri Lankan team .
Author 's take
It seems absurd that the finalists of the 2011 World Cup are having to face such a plight at the hands of the nation that were not entirely known for their Test outings away from home under MS Dhoni . Sangakkara 's fine form in England just makes it all the more befuddling as to why the former captain retired so early when he definitely had so much to give to the team .
A Union Springs man was killed in a single-vehicle crash in Bullock County Friday night .
According to Senior Trooper Reginal King with the Alabama Law Enforcement Agency , Benjamin Gordon Main , 45 , was killed when the 2006 Toyota Camry he was driving left the roadway , hit an embankment and overturned .
The crash happened on Highway 110 about three miles west of Fitzpatrick .
According to King , Main was n't wearing a seat belt . He was pronounced dead on the scene .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - A White House official said on Friday that there has been no discussions or considerations about firing Deputy U.S. Attorney General Rod Rosenstein .
President Donald Trump had appeared to raise that possibility earlier on Friday when asked whether he retained confidence in Rosenstein in the fallout over a Republican memo about the ongoing Russia probe . “ You figure that one out , ” Trump had replied .
Hong Joon-pyo , the presidential candidate of the conservative Liberty Korea Party , vowed Tuesday to reduce fine dust pollution by strengthening cooperation with China and expanding the use of environmentally friendly cars .
Announcing his environmental election pledges , Hong 's campaign said he would launch joint efforts with Beijing to study and curtail fine dust , and push to establish an international organization to improve air quality in Northeast Asia .

Fine dust has been a major source of health concerns for city dwellers here . Fine dust particles , known to cause various respiratory problems , are thought to originate from both the western deserts of China and domestic smog sources.To allay public concerns over air pollution , the prosecutor-turned-politician pledged to increase the number of air purifiers in public facilities , such as schools and hospitals , and reduce pollutant emissions from coal-fired power plants.He also said that if elected , he will push to expand restrictions on old diesel-powered cars in all metropolitan cities and extend fuel subsidies for buses that run on compressed natural gas.His pledges also include increasing the proportion of environment-friendly vehicles to 35 percent of the country 's new car sales by 2022 . The 35 percent represents 350,000 new vehicles to be sold annually.Hong also unveiled his earthquake safety plans , including tax incentives for those that make private buildings quake-resistant.In recent opinion polls , Hong has ranked a distant third with his support ratings boxed in woeful single digits . The election race is increasingly seen as a duel between front-runner Moon Jae-in of the liberal Democratic Party and runner-up Ahn Cheol-soo of the center-left People 's Party . ( Yonhap )

LONDON - M Amir claims bowling Pakistan to a Test series win in England would be `` the best memory '' of his life . Fired-up Amir was a key figure in Pakistan 's nine-wicket win over England in the first Test at Lord 's .
The 26-year-old pace bowler took five wickets in a triumph that put Pakistan on course for a series victory . The second Test of the two-match series begins at Headingley on Friday and Amir has his sights set on completing a success that would rank as the finest achievement of his career .
`` It 's a big achievement winning in Test cricket in England against England at home , '' he said on Wednesday . `` If we win the series I think it will be the best memory of my life . ''
Amir was delighted with Pakistan 's dominant display at Lord 's but he expects England 's wounded pride will ensure the hosts push them much harder in Leeds . `` Winning games at Lord 's - the home of cricket - it is very hard to win ( in England ) . We did well at Lord 's , but it 's passed now , '' he said .
`` Everybody knows England is a very good side - I think one of the best sides in Test cricket - and they will come harder at us here . But we are ready for that challenge . ''
Mohammad Abbas was Pakistan 's most potent seamer at Lord 's , with eight wickets , while Hasan Ali took four in the first innings . Amir believes they all have Pakistan bowling coach Azhar Mahmood to thank for the damage they caused to England 's creaky batting line-up .
`` Credit goes to all the bowlers , especially Mohammad Abbas . He 's bowling very well - and Hasan Ali , '' Amir said . `` But credit goes to Azhar Mahmood as well . He 's working hard with us and keeps telling us , 'Pitch the ball up , pitch the ball up ' . I think that was the main difference at Lord 's . `` We are looking for the same here , and I always give the credit to Azhar Mahmood because he is working so hard - and he is the man behind this . ''
Meanwhile , Keaton Jennings says he must make the numbers stack up this time after being given a second chance to prove himself as a Test match opener .
In six Tests before being dropped in favour of Mark Stoneman nine months ago , the left-hander could muster only 294 runs at an average of 24.50 despite a century on debut in Mumbai . Against Pakistan at Headingley this week , the 25-year-old will become the first of the 12 openers tried since 2012 as Alastair Cook 's partner to be given a second shot at what Jennings describes as “ one of the toughest jobs in Test cricket ” .
Long before he was first called up for England , Jennings began a university accountancy degree as a teenager – and he is still working towards his graduation , between cricket assignments . Asked if he can make a success of his Test aspirations as England bid to battle back from their nine-wicket defeat at Lord 's , he said : “ I suppose that 'll only be answered at the end of the week .
“ You will only get judged on the amount of runs you score . With cricket , you can do everything right and things just do n't work out sometimes . ( But ) I 'm really excited about this week – I want to play with a happy heart and a big smile on my face . ”
Jennings hopes his move from Durham to Lancashire will help him handle his return to Test cricket . “ I 've moved away to address those issues , not only technically but in my life and the way I was going about things , ” he said . “ At the end of the week I 'm sure there 'll be more talk about whether the changes have worked . If there are runs on the board then great – if not , I guess there 's more addressing to be done . ”
In a BBC interview , he made it clear he will not invite extra pressure . He added : “ I want to enjoy this week . It might be the last Test I play – so I really want to enjoy the feeling . It 's one of the toughest jobs in Test cricket , especially in England . That 's what makes Cookie one of the most valuable players around . He 's the only player to score 10,000 Test runs as an opener ( Cook has 11,472 ) , he averages 45 , he 's played 153 Tests on the bounce – and that 's also why there 's been a lot of guys rotated around him . ”
Jennings ' brief is to ensure he does not become the first to be ‘ rotated ' twice – and to that end he will rely on relevant knowledge already acquired . “ You try and lean on your support structure , lean on people you trust , anybody at the time that you feel is going to make a difference and pull you through that dark period , ” he said , recalling the circumstances preceding his omission last summer . “ This is huge . I feel privileged , honoured and I hope I can make an impact . ”

ALEXANDRIA , Va. ( AP )  A rifle-wielding attacker opened fire on Republican lawmakers at a congressional baseball practice Wednesday , wounding House GOP Whip Steve Scalise of Louisiana and several others as congressmen and aides dove for cover . The assailant , prepared with a lot of ammo ,  fought a gun battle with police before he , too , was shot and later died .
Michigan resident Matt Mika , current director of government relations at Tyson Foods , was shot and critically injured . He previously served on congressional staff for Rep. Tim Walberg , R- MI 7th , and former Rep. Dave Camp , R- MI 4th .
Scalise , 51 , the No . 3 House Republican leader first elected to the House in 2008 , was in critical condition and had undergone surgery at a nearby hospital as of 2:30 p.m. Wednesday . He was shot in the hip .
Two other people wounded were in critical condition at the George Washington University Hospital , a spokeswoman said , but the condition of the two others was not immediately known . Texas Rep. Roger Williams , who coaches the GOP team , said a member of his staff was shot and was receiving medical attention .

Scalise dragged himself off the infield leaving a trail of blood as colleagues rushed to his assistance .
The shooter was identified as James T. Hodgkinson , a 66-year-old home inspector from Illinois who had several minor run-ins with the law in recent years and belonged to a Facebook group called Terminate the Republican Party.
Shortly after the shooting , Bernie Sanders , the former candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination , said on the Senate floor that the shooter apparently was a volunteer for his campaign last year . Sanders said he denounced the violence in the strongest possible terms.
Capitol Police officers who were in Scalises security detail wounded the shooter , who was taken into custody . He later died of his injuries , President Donald Trump told the nation from the White House .
Everyone on that field is a public servant ,  Trump said . Their sacrifice makes democracy possible.
Scalise , 51 , the No . 3 House Republican leader first elected to the House in 2008 , was in stable condition and undergoing surgery . The popular and gregarious lawmaker is known for his love of baseball and handed out commemorative bats when he secured the No . 3 job of House whip several years ago .
Texas Rep. Roger Williams , who coaches the GOP team , said that one of his aides , Zack Barth , was shot , but is doing well and is expected to make a full recovery. Two Capitol Police officers were also injured but were expected to recover , along with a former congressional aide who was hospitalized .
Rep. Jeff Duncan of South Carolina said he had just left the practice and encountered the apparent gunman in the parking lot before the shooting . The man calmly asked which partys lawmakers were practicing and Duncan told him they were the Republicans . The man thanked him .
The gunman had a rifle and a lot of ammo ,  said Sen. Jeff Flake of Arizona , who was at the practice .
The shocking event left the Capitol horrified and stunned . The House canceled proceedings for the day . Speaker Paul Ryan of Wisconsin and Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi of California both spoke on the floor issuing calls for unity . An attack on one of us is an attack on all of us ,  Ryan said .
The shooting occurred at a popular park and baseball complex in Alexandria , Virginia , where Republican lawmakers and others were gathered for a morning practice about 7 a.m . They were in good spirits despite the heat and humidity as they prepared for the congressional baseball match that pits Republicans against Democrats . The popular annual face-off , which raises money for charity , is scheduled for Thursday evening at Nationals Park across the Potomac River in Washington , and will go forward as planned .
The team was taking batting practice when gunshots rang out and chaos erupted .
Scalise was fielding balls on second base when he was shot , according to lawmakers present , then dragged himself into the outfield to get away from the gunman .
Rep. Mo Brooks , an Alabama Republican , said his colleague crawled into the outfield , leaving a trail of blood.
We started giving him the liquids , I put pressure on his wound in his hip ,  Brooks said .
Texas Rep. Joe Barton , still in his baseball uniform , told reporters a shooter came out to the practice and opened fire , shooting at Rep. Trent Kelly , R-Miss. , who plays third base .
He shot at Steve Scalise , our second baseman . He hit Steve Scalise ,  Barton said , Scalises security detail and the Capitol Hill police immediately returned fire , and Alexandria Police also immediately came and began to return fire . They shot the shooter . The security detail saved a lot of lives because they attacked the shooter.
Barton said the shooting lasted 5-10 minutes , and there were dozens or more of shots fired .
It was scary ,  Barton said .
Lawmakers took cover in the dugout . Barton said his son , Jack , got under an SUV .
Texas Rep. Mike Conaway , who was at the game , described what sounded like an explosion , then lawmakers scattering off the field as police roamed in search of the gunman and engaged him .
The guys down to a handgun , he dropped his rifle , they shoot him , I go over there , they put him in handcuffs ,  Conaway said , adding that if the shooter had gotten inside the fence , where a bunch of guys is holed up in the dugout , it would have been like shooting fish in a barrel.
FBI special agent in charge Tim Slater said it was too early to say whether it was an act of terrorism , or whether Scalise was targeted .
Speaker Ryan identified the wounded Capitol Police officers as David Bailey and Crystal Griner . Also wounded was former congressional aide Matt Mika , who now works for Tysons Food in its Washington office . Mikas family said the lobbyist was shot multiple times and was in critical condition and in surgery .
After the gunfire stopped , Sen. Flake , of Arizona , said he ran onto the field and also tried to come to Scalises aide . After medical personnel arrived , he said he retrieved Scalises phone and made the first call to Scalises wife to notify her of the shooting . He said he did so to ensure that Mrs. Scalise would not find out about the shooting through the media .
Falisa Peoples was just leaving the YMCA next to the ball field when she saw the shooter open fire .
He was just very calm . He was just walking and shooting ,  she said of the man , whom she described as white and wearing a T-shirt and shorts . She said he was using a long gun and exchanging fire with law enforcement officers , one of whom yelled for her to get down .
Lawmakers were stunned in the aftermath of the event , which raised questions about the security of members of Congress . While the top lawmakers , including Scalise , have security details , others do not and regularly appear in public without protection . The last time a lawmaker was shot was when Democratic Rep. Gabby Giffords of Arizona was hit in the head and grievously injured while meeting with constituents at a supermarket parking lot in 2011 .
Following the Giffords shooting , lawmakers have held fewer open town halls and have been advised to increase security at such events .

The Iowa Department of Transportation employee who designed the new license plates posted on social media about the criticism she 's received since they were unveiled last week .
Graphic designer Christina Andersen says in a post on Facebook that some 5,000 people have made negative comments on-line in the 48 hours since the three designs were unveiled last Thursday and she says they indirectly told her that her work sucks , she has the talent of a third grader and should be fired .
Andersen says she was restricted from designing a full color plate that Iowans wanted because the numbers on the plate have to be easily read by police . And cost constraints do not allow for embossed letters to be used on the plates .
Andersen says the criticism “ ranges from stinging to an absolute gut punch that leaves me short of breath and tears flowing uncontrollably. ” She says artists know their work will be criticized , but asks that people be more thoughtful .
You can see the plates and vote on your favorite plate design at the Iowa State Fair or online .
What worries me the most is why people tend to get very irked when we present them good news . I will keep asking questions and keep researching issues deeply . I like to see where the trouble is and not to be told `` Shut up ! You have to believe because the world believes it ! ''
Penguins , Polar bears and Whales : Why are they flourishing ?
These are all the latest reports . Why is questioning such obvious successes considered environmental blasphemy ? The only thing one can not question today is climate projections and sacred holy books . If you can not openly question , you have a problem . ( # globalwarming # environmentaldegradation # antartica )
1 . King Penguins breed on the subantarctic islands at the N reaches of Antarctica , S Georgia , and other temperate islands of the region . Their total population is estimated at over 2.2 million pairs and is increasing…
3.6 million more Penguins live in Antarctica than thought : New research estimates roughly six million Adélie penguins live in East Antarctica . These pictures contradict the heart-rending painting of polar bear and penguin balanced on a small patch of ice surrounded by ocean that created a lot of noise .
http : //news.nationalgeographic.com/…/adelie-penguin-popula…/
2 . Even global polar bear population is larger than previous thought – almost 30,000 !
This means the adjusted 2015 global estimate for polar bears should be about 28,500 ( average ) , a marked increase over the official estimate of 26,500 ( average ) for 2015 — and an even larger increase over the 2005 estimate of about 22,500 ( average ) , despite the dramatic loss of summer sea ice since 2007 that we hear about endlessly .
It is increasingly obvious that polar bears are thriving despite having lived through summer sea ice levels not predicted to occur until 2050 – levels of sea ice that experts said would wipe out 2/3 of the world 's polar bears ( Amstrup et al . 2007 ; Crockford 2017 v3 ) .

3 . For the first time in a century , humpback whales have returned to the waters of New York harbor . And not just occasionally , either . They 're coming in enough numbers that a company can reliably trot tourists out to the ocean—within sight distance of Manhattan 's skyscrapers—to see them .
“ Because of the improvement of the water quality , algae and zooplankton have multiplied , giving good food for the menhaden [ a small oily forager fish beloved by whales ] , which have returned in numbers that the fishermen say they have not seen in their lifetimes , ” Paul L. Sieswerda told PopSci .
http : //www.timesunion.com/…/humpback-whales-have-returned-t…
4 . I was also actively researching without any clear explanation as to why The North Pole is losing about 30,000 square miles of sea ice per year .
Please read here : Opposite Behaviours ? Arctic Sea Ice Shrinks , Antarctic Grows . https : //www.nasa.gov/…/e…/features/arctic-antarctic-ice.html
Over the past century , average global temperatures have climbed by 1.5 degrees Fahrenheit . And yet , over the past few years , the sea ice that surrounds the South Pole has steadily been growing .
This past September , at the end of the Southern Hemisphere 's winter , the extent of Antarctica 's sea ice reached 19.51 million square kilometres , breaking a 35-year record that dated back to the start of data being collected in 1978 .

MITCHELL TRUBISKY IS beginning his pre-combine workout on the football field at Santa Margarita Catholic High School in Orange County , California , and his attention is divided . The footwork drills are important , sure , but he 's more concerned about Ricky and Jake , who are about 50 yards away , behind the end zone , just out of earshot . The road to the NFL draft is fraught with peril for a top-rated quarterback -- the general weirdness of the combine , the linguistic complexity of NFL playcalls , the mysteries of team workouts . But nothing compares with the sight of your buddies from home talking to a reporter .
Trubisky warned me beforehand . `` They 're degenerates , '' he said , in the kindest way possible . `` They 're great , they 're the life of the party , but they have no filter . ''
They arrived from Ohio two nights earlier for a spring break visit with their now-famous friend . Ricky Dexter attends Bowling Green State , Jake Curtis Ohio U . They were planning on going to South Padre Island , Texas , before being invited here , where they can catch passes from future NFL quarterbacks and swim in the ocean off Laguna . They grew up with Trubisky in Mentor , Ohio , and they 've been friends as long as they can remember . They know almost everything about the 22-year-old , projected by most to be the first quarterback taken in the NFL draft . They played on opposite teams in youth football and on the same team for a time in high school . They hung out at the Trubisky house , read the plaque above the fireplace -- do what is right/not what is easy -- ate Jeanne Trubisky 's cabbage rolls and played every kind of ball with Trubisky and his three siblings in the wide , fenceless yard that backs to the woods .
In other words , at the precise moment when Mitchell Trubisky ( or Mitch , up to you , does n't matter , but it 's Mitchell when you 're with those who 've known him this long ) is most aware of how he is perceived in the outside world , when image control is most closely aligned with self-preservation , Ricky and Jake enter the scene . They are among his best friends ; they infect him with marrow-deep dread .
And so he keeps an eye on them . Before the workout , on one of the first truly warm days of Trubisky 's two-and-a-half-month stay in Southern California , he pulled Ricky and Jake aside and spoke in a manner that could be described as pleading . He bore down on them with those brown eyes , irises nearly as dark as pupils , while Ricky and Jake nodded . No problem . It 's their buddy 's future at stake . They get it . They 're adults . They 'll behave .
Adopting their best adult tones , they rummage through the moments they remember from their friend 's career . Mostly , Trubisky spent a lot of time `` wrecking people '' on his way to becoming Mr. Football in Ohio as a senior , which made it even more perplexing when he did n't start a game until his fourth year at North Carolina .
`` That made me mad , '' Jake says . Says Ricky : `` It just took a long time , a long process . He understood what was going on . He knew what he was walking into . ''
`` Just remember , '' Trubisky calls from across the field . `` They have no filter . ''
`` What 's he yelling about ? '' Jake asks .
`` Us , '' Ricky says , and then bellows : `` Dude , you 've got no filter right now . ''
`` Your life can change in one year , '' Trubisky says . `` That 's where I am . That tells me : Why ca n't I win a Super Bowl a year from now ? '' Jeremy M. Lange for ESPN
THE STORY OF Trubisky 's time in Chapel Hill , which ended with a 3,700-yard , 30-touchdown season , has gone from largely unknown to forensically dissected in the months since he decided to forgo his senior year and declare for the draft .
`` 'Why did n't you play sooner ? ' That 's the No . 1 question for him right now , '' says former NFL and current CFL quarterback Ryan Lindley , Trubisky 's predraft quarterbacks coach . `` That 's a testament to him too . There 's not a whole lot else you can pick apart in his game except that he only had 13 starts . ''
All 13 came this past season , and he threw just 572 passes in his college career , fewer than the Eagles ' Carson Wentz did . ( Clemson 's Deshaun Watson threw 1,207 . ) But everyone from Trubisky to his parents to UNC coach Larry Fedora to agent Bruce Tollner finishes any sentence that begins `` He only started 13 games '' with `` ... yeah , but he played in 30 . ''
Fedora expands : `` It 's not always the most talented guy who gets the job . Sometimes it 's the guy who fits best with the other guys . '' The explanation feels unsatisfying , not only for Trubisky but for his predecessor , two-year starter Marquise Williams . Trubisky , for his part , manages to say he should have started sooner -- `` the 13 starts were out of my control '' -- without offending anyone . It 's a nifty trick , like parallel-parking a big rig . `` Not playing right away taught me that you have to take advantage of every snap , '' he says .
Trubisky attempted to shed his frustration by getting a few receivers together for late-night throwing sessions at the Tar Heels ' indoor facility or on a lighted intramural field . `` We 'd throw our tennis shoes on , throw out a speaker and go for two and a half hours , '' says Trubisky 's roommate and top target , Ryan Switzer . `` The best thing was it was behind closed doors . We did n't tell anybody , we did n't tell the coaches , we did n't put it on social media . ''
The wait was difficult . Failure is its own kind of torment ; never getting an opportunity might be worse . There were times when Trubisky doubted -- `` It brought him to tears , '' Switzer says -- but he never seriously discussed transferring .
`` There were definitely days I wondered , 'Man , is this really for me ? ' '' Trubisky says . `` But then I 'd wake up and realize this is what I want . I want to be the starting quarterback . I definitely questioned why I was n't playing , but I never said it to anyone but my roommates . I never complained to the coaches . ''
`` Not playing right away taught me that you have to take advantage of every snap , '' Trubisky says . Jeremy M. Lange for ESPN
Not even Ricky and Jake know the story of the only time Trubisky wanted to quit football . He was 7 years old , in his first year in pads , and he quickly tired of being hit by older kids . Jeanne , who runs the Trubisky household with legendary efficiency , shot down that idea . `` If you do n't want to get hit , '' she told him , `` run faster . '' She talks so fast , a trait she ascribes to growing up one of 10 children , that when she 's asked what advice she gave her oldest child while he was waiting his turn in Chapel Hill , the words rush out like they 're sprinting toward a finish line : `` Do n't complain about it . Do something about it . Change it . Bebetterplayharderbeabetterleaderbenoticed . ''
`` My mom 's a character , '' Trubisky says . `` My dad was my coach , but my mom was the one who was hard on me . I would come home from a game in high school after throwing five touchdowns and she would say , 'Oh , you played all right . You can do a little better . ' ''
So with his mom 's advice a constant soundtrack , Trubisky could be found at least once a week tapping on Fedora 's office door . The question was always the same : What can I do to get better this week ? And the answer invariably bent its way toward one word : presence .
`` I heard that word so much , '' Trubisky says . The coach 's enduring , and often exhausting , quest was to convince Trubisky that quarterbacks ca n't lead by example . Being the man means being loud and forceful and sometimes arrogant . None of those qualities , especially the last one , comes naturally to Trubisky .
`` I almost lost my voice every practice because I 'd be yelling , '' Trubisky says . `` I 'm more of a quieter person , and I think if everyone works hard and does their own job , we should be rolling on the same page . But there are some guys who need that kick in the butt , and that 's what [ Coach Fedora ] needed to see more from me . It made me a better leader . ''
Trubisky has a smile that nearly swallows his eyes and a personality that 's best described with a nonfootball adjective : sweet . There is none of the bro-ness that radiates from Ricky and Jake . He veers toward simplicity , which is why he still drives the '97 sedan his grandmother gave him , and his dry sense of humor can go undetected by the unobservant . Says his mother , `` He 's a little flat sometimes , '' but it 's easy to project that face onto billboards somewhere -- in Cleveland , for instance , for his beloved Browns .
On the field , he 's acknowledged to be the most accurate passer in the draft , and his ability to throw from every angle while on the run -- with force -- has invited comparisons to Aaron Rodgers . Scouts like that he moves and thinks quickly . When he was asked in a combine interview how well , on a scale of 1 to 10 , he is at dancing the NaeNae -- a question of irrefutable relevance -- he says he answered without hesitation : `` I 'd grade myself a 2 , which means you wo n't be seeing me do it . ''
At Trubisky 's pro day at UNC on March 21 , a line of scouts and coaches watched like private investigators as he changed his shoes , stretched his legs and joked with his ex-teammates for more than two hours before he began throwing . An NFL quarterbacks coach , without taking his eyes off Trubisky , said , `` I 'm not looking so much at how he throws but how he handles the day . ''
Back on the high school field in Orange County , Ricky and Jake are running out of compliments .
`` I 'll say this , '' Ricky says . `` He 's better at interviews now than he was in high school . ''
`` Oh , he was terrible , '' Jake says . `` We used to make fun of him so bad . One interview he said 'execute ' probably 20 times . ''
The memory triggers a fit of laughter . The interview in question took place after the homecoming game during Trubisky 's sophomore year at Mentor High School . The camera 's light went on , the reporter started asking questions , and Trubisky -- making his debut on the 11 o'clock news -- indulged in what he endearingly calls his tendency to `` overtalk and repeat the same thing . 'Execute ' was the thing I kept repeating . ''
Ricky is doubled over . The memory of the interview is funny enough on its own , but the laughter is multiplying , becoming its own joke , because Trubisky is staring across the field , shaking his head . He has no idea what they 're talking about , but he seems to possess an innate understanding of this uncontrolled , unfiltered , very nearly degenerate ( in the kindest way possible ) brand of laughter .
`` This is probably the stuff he does n't want us to say , '' Ricky says . `` Here 's the thing , though : There are no skeletons in his closet . There 's literally nothing . There 's just not . He 's boring . ''
Trubisky 's concern does seem unwarranted . His closest brush with controversy , aside from the time he almost got a speeding ticket in high school , came at the combine , when he unwittingly instigated what he calls `` the whole Mitch/Mitchell extravaganza . ''
`` They asked me what my mom calls me , '' he says . `` Mitch , Mitchell -- I do n't care , but my mom prefers Mitchell . I 'll answer to either one . Now it 's like I 'm having an identity crisis or something . I did n't change anything -- call me whatever you want . ''

AT A FANCY juice bar near the high school , Trubisky places his post-workout order and goes outside to take a call . When he comes back , Ricky is taking a picture of his biceps with his sleeve rolled up to his shoulder . `` Just showing off my farmer tan for everyone back home , '' he says , poking the demilitarized zone where pink meets scarlet .
Suddenly , Ricky 's tone changes .
`` Hey , '' he says , reading his phone , `` the Browns just traded for Osweiler . Dude , what 's that all about ? ''
Trubisky says nothing .
`` Did you know that ? ''
`` Yeah , I just got a call . ''
`` What 's that mean for you ? ''
Trubisky shrugs . It 's happening in another world , a world he 's not yet a part of , and the look on his face says it will take some time before he gets used to the idea that things like this are relevant to his life .
`` I really do n't have a reaction , '' he says . `` I mean , I do n't know . ''
The conversation moves on . Brock Osweiler , who , it turns out , was essentially purchased by the Browns for a future draft pick , may or may not impact Trubisky 's life . He 'd love to play for his hometown Browns , who have the first and 12th picks , but there 's no sense worrying about it .
A brand-new Porsche Carrera pulls up in front of the shop . Ricky and Jake take the opportunity to tell Trubisky they expect him to be driving something similar very soon .
`` That 's another thing , '' Trubisky says , `` I 'm going to have to step up my car game , I guess . ''
He squirms . `` It 's just weird to think about , '' he says . I suggest that being a first-round pick , and a quarterback , comes with certain demands . Symbolically , rolling up to the first day of minicamp in a 20-year-old car might be a problem .
`` I 'd be fine just keeping it , '' he says . `` It 's weird to think about money and all that other stuff . I really just want to play football . ''
Trubisky is between worlds , in a postcollege , pre-NFL purgatory . It 's an uncomfortable , exciting place , with rules he 's not entirely sure he understands . `` Your life can change in one year , '' Trubisky says . `` You can go from a nobody , not even getting any playing time on a college team , to being one of the most highly touted quarterbacks coming out of college for the draft . That 's where I am . That tells me : Why ca n't I win a Super Bowl a year from now ? ''
Toward the end of that afternoon 's workout , Trubisky finished a sprinting drill and looked across the field to see Ricky and Jake , still laughing . He dropped his arms in disgust -- what could possibly be so funny ? -- and turned away in surrender . What else could he do ? His stay in purgatory is nearing its end , and a new world beckons . Forgive him for wanting to bring the old one along .
LAHORE , Aug 14 ( APP ) : Former prime minister Muhammad
Nawaz Sharif on Monday vowed to ensure the sanctity of vote
and supremacy of the Constitution .
“ Pakistan Muslim League-N will bring necessary amendments
in the Constitution for the respect of public mandate , ” he told

Day of Pakistan .
The former premier said Pakistan came into being
under the leadership of Quaid-i-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah
after democratic and legal struggle .
During the last 70 years , he said , the Constitution was not followed
in its true spirit which was why the country could not make tangible progress and that lesson should be learnt from the past mistakes .
He said , the country was making progress by leaps and bounds
and called his removal as a setback for the country .
Nawaz Sharif said , he brought prosperity during his
four years of tenure and fulfilled all the promises . He said
the economy was growing with a pace , energy projects were being
accomplished and law and order was improving especially in
Karachi .
He said a large number people especially youth had
accompanied him from Islamabad to Lahore .
He also pledged to bring reforms in the judicial
system , as he said , in the present system , a grandson fight
case filed by his grandfather .
“ Provision of speedy and cheaper justice will be the top
agenda of PML-N 's next government , ” he said , adding , the state
would be responsible for fighting court cases of the poor .
“ Pakistan is not of a few people but of 200 million people ” ,
he added .
Earlier , the former prime minister Muhammad nawaz Sharif
visited the mausoleum of Poet of the East Allama Iqbal and laid
a floral wreath on the grave and offered fateha .
Special prayers were offered for the progress , prosperity
and integrity of the country .

The Amazon series “ Sneaky Pete ” is relocating production for its third season from New York to California , and has been approved conditionally to receive a $ 9.2 million tax credit from the Golden State .
The California Film Commission made the announcement on Monday , noting that “ Sneaky Pete ” will employ nearly 250 casts , 220 crew , and 2,510 extras . The series plans to spend more than $ 53 million in qualified expenditures — defined as the portion of total expenditures allocated for wages to below-the-line workers and payments to in-state vendors .
The relocation makes “ Sneaky Pete ” the 13th TV series to relocate to California under its three-year-old expanded tax credit program . It 's also the third show to come to California from New York following Showtime 's “ The Affair ” and Netflix 's “ The OA . ”
“ Our success with these relocating projects shows how the tax credit is working to affirm California 's status as the preferred choice for TV production , ” said California Film Commission executive director Amy Lemisch . “ From the earliest days of TV , shows set in other locales have been filmed in California . We 're excited to welcome another series from New York that will generate long-term employment and economic activity here at home . ”

“ Sneaky Pete ” was co-created by Bryan Cranston and stars Giovanni Ribisi . Its first two seasons were set in upstate New York , with much of the action also in and around New York City .
The commission noted Monday that many TV series set in New York have been filmed in California , including “ 2 Broke Girls ” ( CBS ) , “ Brooklyn Nine-Nine ” ( Fox ) , “ CSI : NY ” ( CBS ) , “ Castle ” ( ABC ) , “ Gossip Girl ” ( The CW ) , “ Good Girls Revolt ” ( Amazon ) , “ Mad Men ” ( AMC ) , “ The Mindy Project ” ( Fox/Hulu ) , “ The Newsroom ” ( HBO ) , and “ Will & Grace ” ( NBC ) .
“ One of the many advantages to filming in California is our unique ability to match the look of just about any other locale — from New York City to other planets , ” Lemisch added . “ No other production center has our diversity of locations , as well as weather , talent , and infrastructure . ”
The 2015-16 fiscal year marked a major expansion of the eight-year-old tax credit program , aimed at halting the erosion of California-based production to states with bigger incentives , such as Georgia and New York . The annual allocation rose from $ 100 million to $ 330 million , and applications are ranked on how many jobs they will produce , rather than being selected by lottery .
The credit is set at 20 % , but producers are eligible for an additional 5 % “ uplift ” if they relocate a TV series from another state , shoot outside the L.A. zone , commit to music scoring or music track recording in the state , or do visual effects in California .
Other series that have relocated to California include Dwayne Johnson 's HBO series “ Ballers ” from Florida ; “ Mistresses ” ( which returned to California from Vancouver ) ; “ Scream Queens ” and “ American Horror Story ” ( which moved from Louisiana ) ; “ Veep ” ( from Maryland ) ; “ Secrets and Lies ” ( from North Carolina ) ; and ABC 's “ American Crime ” ( from Texas ) .
The commission said Monday that a total of 67 television projects — including new TV series , relocating TV series , pilots , movies of the week , and miniseries — have been accepted into its Program 2.0 since it launched in July of 2015 . It explained that due to its ongoing success drawing long-term TV projects , the latest TV application period ( held Feb. 12 to Feb. 16 ) was open only to relocating series and recurring series already accepted into the tax credit program , including 31 recurring TV series in various stages of production .
The 31 programs were unveiled on Monday with the caveat that the list is subject to change , as series may withdraw and their reservation of tax credits would roll over into the pool of funds for the next TV allocation period . In addition to “ Sneaky Pete , ” the list includes Showtime 's “ The Affair , ” Fox 's “ American Horror Story , ” A & E 's “ American Princess , ” Horizon 's “ Animal Kingdon , ” HBO 's “ Ballers , ” ABC 's “ Code Black , ” CBS ' “ Crazy Ex-Girlfriend , ” Horizon 's “ Famous in Love , ” Viacom 's “ Heathers , ” Weirdo 's “ Here and Now , ” and Showtime 's “ I 'm Dying up Here . ”
Also on the list — Universal 's “ Law & Order True Crime : The Menendez Murders , ” Minim 's “ Legion , ” WB 's “ Lucifer , ” Fox21 's “ Mayans MC , ” Lunar Mining 's “ The OA , ” Fox 's “ The Orville , ” BET 's “ Rebel , ” ABC 's “ The Rookie , ” Sony 's “ S.W.A.T , ” HBO 's “ Sharp Objects , ” Paramount 's “ Shooter , ” Fox 's “ Snowfall , ” CBS ' “ Strange Angel , ” Fox 's “ This Is Us , ” Sony 's “ Timeless , ” Disney 's “ Untitled Peacock Project , ” Second in Command 's “ Veep , ” and HBO 's “ Westworld . ”
Two men who stole more than £32,000 from Crich Post Office have been jailed .
Dwain Tainton , 29 , of Mill Lane , Codnor , was given 69 months in prison for his part in the robbery , while Ian Armstron , 35 , of Grangewood Road , Meir , Stoke-on-Trent was jailed for 61 months .
Ian Armstrong .
The pair appeared before Derby Crown Court on Friday December 8 . Tainton changed his plea to guilty on the second day of his trial while Armstrong had pleaded guilty at an earlier hearing .
The pair went into the post office , in Market Place , on the afternoon of April 26 , wearing motorcycle helmets . One threatened the postmistress while the other emptied the safe .
They escaped on a stolen motorbike , which was later recovered in the River Derwent .
Detective Sergeant Simon Cartwright , who oversaw the investigation , said : “ This robbery was distressing for the postmistress , who was working alone that day .
“ The investigation team worked tirelessly to bring this pair to justice and we 're pleased with the sentencing , which reflects the severity of the crime .
“ I hope the victim can get some form of comfort from the knowledge that these men are now behind bars . ”
MEXICO CITY ( Reuters ) - The United States ' top diplomat landed in Mexico on Thursday with debate swirling over the government 's efforts to win favour with Washington and save the NAFTA pact from collapse , sparking concerns it is ceding sovereignty to its northern neighbour .
Mexico has been at pains to prove itself a good ally to the United States on combating drug trafficking and immigration , in hopes this would help efforts to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement on as favourable terms as possible .
Those secret efforts sprang into view this week , when Reuters exclusively reported that Mexico is considering allowing U.S. air marshals aboard commercial cross-border flights , igniting a debate over what lengths Mexico should go to in order to win favour with its top trade partner .
“ The question is , what else is ( Foreign Minister Luis ) Videgaray giving to Trump and his collaborators in exchange for preserving NAFTA ? ” Salvador Garcia Soto asked in his El Universal newspaper column , decrying Videgaray 's “ opaque ” manoeuvring .
U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson landed in Mexico City on Thursday afternoon and was due to have dinner with Videgaray and other senior Mexican government and national security officials at U.S . Ambassador Roberta Jacobson 's residence .
Although Tillerson has not been a prominent player in the NAFTA discussions , the future of the treaty is certain to loom over his visit , especially at a trilateral meeting with Canada 's Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland on Friday .
Mexico 's government , and particularly the foreign ministry , has pushed hard to defend NAFTA , a lynchpin of its export-led economy , ahead of a July 2018 election in which the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party is currently polling third .
“ All our efforts right now are based around NAFTA and making sure the pact does n't collapse , ” said a senior Mexican diplomat .
Videgaray has said closer cooperation with the United States is the best way to achieve Mexico 's foreign policy aims .
“ Obviously that would be something that we strongly want to avoid , ” Videgaray said at an event in New York late last year , reffering to NAFTA collapsing . “ We realize that we could achieve much more by being constructive and by approaching the relationship looking for common ground ... with very active cooperation . ”
Quizzed by ruling party lawmakers on Tuesday , Videgaray denied the air marshals were part of any NAFTA quid pro quo , but said the government was studying the plan .
CLOSER TIES
Tillerson 's Mexico City visit is the first leg in a week-long Latin America trip in which he hopes to keep up pressure on Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro over his restrictions on domestic political opposition .
Earlier on Thursday , in a speech at his alma mater University of Texas at Austin , Tillerson raised the prospect that the Venezuelan military could decide to oust President Nicolas Maduro but said he did not know whether that would happen .
Tillerson insisted the Trump administration was not advocating “ regime change ” in Venezuela but said it would be “ easiest ” if Maduro chose to leave power on his own .
In his most important regional policy statement since his appointment , Tillerson also warned Latin American countries against excessive reliance on economic ties with China , while sounding alarm over Russia 's growing presence .
Tillerson is due to meet with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto , and Videgaray for a second time , on Friday , and they are certain to discuss Central American migration and drug trafficking , two areas in which Mexico has sought to work more closely with the United States since U.S. President Donald Trump took office .
Videgaray , who flew to Washington earlier this week ahead of Tillerson 's arrival , is Pena Nieto 's most trusted adviser , and has forged close ties with Trump 's son-in-law , Jared Kushner , who serves as a senior advisor to the president .
The influential foreign minister has stepped to the fore of regional Latin American efforts to condemn Maduro 's government and has also proved a good friend to the Trump administration on sensitive foreign policy issues including North Korea , Israel and Honduras .
Former Mexican diplomat and intelligence official Gustavo Mohar said it would be foolish to assume such efforts could yield a positive NAFTA result .
“ The priority of Mexico 's foreign policy in the short-term has been to reach an agreement with the Trump government on trade , ” he said . “ But that does n't guarantee you anything , because this guy ( Trump ) is very unpredictable . ”
BOSTON -- Well , that did n't take long .
Skating in his first career NHL game , Boston Bruins forward Ryan Donato made the most of his debut with the Black and Gold -- scoring his first career goal -- and point -- of his professional career Monday night against the Columbus Blue Jackets .
Donato lit the lamp at 5:41 in the second period , taking a feed from Torey Krug and rifling home a one-timer from the right circle that beat Blue Jackets netminder Joonas Korpisalo to tie the contest up at 1-1 .
RYAN DONATO 'S FIRST AS A BRUIN AND IT 'S A LASER ! Whooo ! pic.twitter.com/JCPdV8oz0d -- Colin Beswick ( @ CBeswick ) March 20 , 2018
Donato has seen his stock rise as the Bruins top prospect due to his potential as an elite scorer . In his final season with Harvard , Ryan Donato scored 26 goals in just 29 games with the Crimson .
Midway through the second period , Donato has already fired five shots on goal while logging 8:29 of ice time .
You get two for the price of one with the Creagh/Carr Review – the opinions of seasoned hackette Bev Creagh and flamboyant newshound Stewart Carr . Here 's what they thought of Love From a Stranger , playing at Milton Keynes Theatre until Saturday , July 7 .
CREAGH SAYS .... When I was a little girl , my mother told me if I could n't say anything nice , not to say anything at all . That 's all well and good – unless you happen to be writing a review .
Well , let 's see – the music was dark and menacing , setting the scene . The set was stark and effective , with strip sections that moved from side to side .
But oh dear – the story . And the casting . Came out wishing I 'd stayed home and watched England beat Colombia , even though I 'm no footie fan .
Because the play was written by Agatha Christie ( and Frank Vosper ) , I mistakenly thought I was in for an entertaining whodunit in a glamorous country-house setting with loads of posh-speaking suspicious characters .
Should have done my homework ! It 's billed as a ‘ chilling and tense psychological thriller ' but you could have fooled me .
Girl ditches fiancé of five years after winning stash of cash , takes up with dodgey American who comes to rent her flat . But there 's a twist in the tale – and no doubt you 've sussed that too .
Helen Bradbury as Cecily Harrington , the upper class gel craving excitement after her big win , looks more like someone 's maiden aunt than a young ingenue , although she does do a good line in flirtatious archery . But Sam Frenchum simply does n't cut the mustard in the role of suave American Bruce Lovell , the shady photographer allegedly swept off his feet by simpering Cecily .
There is no chemistry whatsoever between them , in spite of several raunchy scenes bordering on the pornographic .
Jilted fiancé Michael Lawrence ( Justin Avoth ) is one of the few believable characters in this clunky tale while Gareth Williams is magnificent as Hodgson the gardener .
Ethel the maid may have raised a few laughs but Molly Logan 's performance was more suited to farce than serious theatre .
The only truly Christie characters were Alice Haig as Mavis and Nicola Sanderson as Auntie Loulou .
All I can say is no wonder this particular offering from the pen of the doyenne has stayed on the shelf for so long .
CARR SAYS .... Oh Agatha , this was not your finest moment !
The classic talespinner is usually a safe pair of hands for an evening of whodunnit murder mayhem , but this early attempt is one that deserved to moulder away in the archives .
An obscure short story first adapted into a play in 1936 , Love From a Stranger is a melodrama that lumbers between female awakening and old-fashioned misogyny .
Young Cecily Harrington ( Helen Bradbury ) is in a flutter of hormones , having recently won £25k on a sweepstake while awaiting the return of her erstwhile fiance Michael ( Jason Avoth ) , whose genuine love just is n't enough to keep her in tow .
Beardman and D'Avoth 's cutglass accents hit all the right notes and the stilted romance and tension between them is palpable . It uplifts a soap opera subplot into something with a more meaningful spark .
Into Cecily 's life steps the phoney American Bruce Lovell ( Sam Frenchum ) in a performance so ham-fisted , it 's hard to ride along with it .
Bradbury and Frenchum jarr whenever they 're on stage , missing altogether the ingredients of seduction .
Director Lucy Bailey revels in the contradictions that lie at at the heart of Love From a Stranger . We occasionally depart from the tweed and greenery of postwar England into a world of red flashlights and seedy erotic conflict , awkwardly transitioning between the two .
Nicola Sanderson channels To The Manor Born as the eccentric Aunt Loulou , easily scoring the biggest laughs of the night , and Alice Haig adds in her own comedic irony to the part of Cecily 's straightlaced friend Mavis .
Indulgent and predictable but with a few great performances to boot - Love From A Stranger plays at Milton Keynes Theatre until July 7 . See here for tickets .

A prominent Major League Baseball agent said Friday that a `` fight is brewing '' over the lack of free-agent activity in the game this offseason , and said a spring training boycott might be on the horizon if teams do n't begin signing players soon .
Agent Brodie Van Wagenen of Creative Artists Agency stopped short of using the word `` collusion '' but said the behavior of owners `` feels coordinated , rightly or wrongly . ''
`` There is a rising tide among players for radical change , '' Van Wagenen said in a Twitter post Friday . `` A fight is brewing . And it may begin with one , maybe two , and perhaps 1,200 willing to follow . A boycott of spring training may be a starting point , if behavior does n't change .
`` Bottom line , the players are upset . No , they are outraged . Players in the midst of long-term contracts are as frustrated as those still seeking employment . Their voices are getting louder and they are uniting in a way not seen since 1994 . ''
Commissioner Rob Manfred , addressing the slow hot stove market at the quarterly owners meetings in Beverly Hills , California , on Thursday , cited a number of factors that have contributed to the lack of activity this winter .
`` Every [ free-agent ] market is different , '' Manfred told reporters . `` There are different players , different quality of players , different GMs , different decisions , a new basic agreement , different agents who had particular prominence in a particular market in terms of who they represent .
`` Those factors , and probably others that I ca n't tick off the top of my head , have combined to produce a particular market this year . Just like there 's been some markets where the lid got blown off in terms of player salary growth , occasionally you 're going to have some that are not quite as robust . ''
Although MLB declined to respond to Van Wagenen 's statement directly , the commissioner 's office has said privately that a spring training boycott would be a violation of baseball 's collective bargaining agreement .
Van Wagenen represents such prominent players as Ryan Zimmerman , Robinson Cano , Jacob deGrom , Yoenis Cespedes and Ian Desmond . The CAA group also represents current free agents Todd Frazier , Andrew Cashner , Jon Jay , Jason Vargas , Chris Young and Matt Belisle -- all of whom remain unsigned .
Van Wagenen joins Scott Boras as the second high-profile agent to publicly question the lack of activity in a dormant winter for baseball free agency . Outfielder Lorenzo Cain 's five-year , $ 80 million contract with the Milwaukee Brewers is the most lucrative deal of the offseason . Meanwhile , Yu Darvish , Jake Arrieta , J.D . Martinez , Eric Hosmer , Mike Moustakas , Lance Lynn and Alex Cobb are among dozens of free agents still looking for work .
More than 90 players from this year 's initial free-agent crop are still unsigned , according to the Major League Baseball Players Association .
`` Many club presidents and general managers with whom we negotiate are frustrated with the lack of funds to sign the plethora of good players still available , raising further suspicion of institutional influence over the spending , '' Van Wagenen said in his statement . `` Even the algorithms that have helped determine player salaries in recent years are suggesting dramatically higher values than owners are willing to spend . ''
At a charity luncheon in Boston on Friday , Red Sox president of baseball operations Dave Dombrowski said he has never seen an offseason as slow as this one .
`` This is by far the most unusual situation , '' Dombrowski reportedly said . `` You usually have a player or two who might be out there in a particular year , but never the number of free agents that we have .
Dombrowski was filling in on a panel for Boras , who reportedly canceled his scheduled appearance at the luncheon , which benefited Paul and Theo Epstein 's Foundation to Be Named Later and the Red Sox Foundation . Bora represents some of the most high-profile agents , who have not yet signed , including outfielder Martinez .
Red Sox president Sam Kennedy acknowledged the inactive free-agent market has `` somewhat '' hurt business for the team .
Kennedy said that ticket sales are down `` a few percentage points '' from the same time last year . He said he figured it would pick up when the Patriots season ends , and if the Red Sox sign a big name .
Rhetoric from the players ' side has grown increasingly more combative as spring training approaches . Los Angeles Dodgers closer Kenley Jansen told reporters , `` Maybe we need to go on strike , to be honest with you , '' during the team 's recent fan festival . Van Wagenen , similarly , said owners are testing the players ' resolve with their lack of offseason spending .
`` I would suggest that testing the will of 1,200 alpha males at the pinnacle of their profession is not a good strategy for 30 men who are bound by a much smaller fraternity , '' Van Wagenen said . `` These 1,200 players have learned first-hand that battles are won through teamwork , and they understand that championships ca n't be achieved by individuals . They are won by a group united by a singular focus . Victory at all costs . They are willing to sweat for it ; they are willing to sacrifice for it ; they are willing to cry for it ; and most importantly , they are willing to bleed for it . ''
In a statement on Friday afternoon , MLB Players Association executive director Tony Clark said players will continue to defend themselves if `` attacked . ''
Baseball has not had a work stoppage since 1994-95 , when the owners ' threats to impose a salary cap prompted players to go on strike in August 1994 . After then-commissioner Bud Selig canceled the World Series , the dispute was settled in late April of 1995 , and MLB has enjoyed a run of labor peace in the 23 years since .
Looking at the current depth chart of the Denver Broncos , the team suddenly seems to have a bevy of defensive linemen , more than one of which is an undrafted free agent .
In the most recent edition of our ongoing series spotlighting the undrafted rookies of the Denver Broncos , the focus was on defensive tackle Tyrique Jarrett . Here , the focus will be on his college teammate , Shakir Soto .
Soto put together a solid career in high school and was a top 25 college prospect across the entire state of Pennsylvania before signing with Pittsburgh .
Soto played in 42 games during his college career , but did n't earn a full-time starting job until his senior year . He finished his time at Pitt with 7.5 sacks and 18 tackles for a loss .
Overshadowed by Jarrett while playing on the same defensive line as him , Soto was n't high on anyone 's draft radar and likely figured he 'd have to take the undrafted route to the league . Now that he 's there , he 'll have to really shine in practices and preseason games if he is going to be anything other than a practice squad player or a guy just happy to take part in a training camp .
Below is a video of Soto and his family celebrating his signing with Denver . Like all players , he 's happy for the opportunity . If he can translate that happiness into success on the field , there 's no telling what kind of summer he could have .
Soto will have plenty of competition in front of him . In fact , if you were to rank each of Denver 's defensive linemen , there 's a good chance you 'd have Soto at the very bottom .
Soto did n't receive an invite to the scouting combine and he did n't post hugh numbers at his pro day either , which included just 18 bench press reps of 225 pounds . Still , he may be able to show enough athleticism to convince coaches to invest time in developing him .
My Take
I feel fans should be happy with the work John Elway put into improving the defensive line this offseason . Domata Peko and Zach Kerr are both solid additions and second-round pick DeMarcus Walker could be an early difference maker .
The team still has Derek Wolfe , Jared Crick , Adam Gotsis and Billy Winn . I just do n't see any room for Soto .
In addition , I feel that Jarrett may have a better chance than any undrafted player on the roster to make the team and it 's highly unlikely that both players will be kept .
Soto 's best bet will be to earn a spot on the practice squad but I do n't even see that happening . He 'll end up being let go before the season starts .

My Fair Lady turns 95 : by Marie Pietersz Gwen Pietersz ( née Bertus ) , the matriach of the Pietersz family , celebrated her 95th milestone birthday recently , choosing a private party in Ringwood to share with her heritage of four generations of Pieterszs . Her cake was a tribute to her long life and relationship with her family , the message reading , Queen Gwen , 95 Years Loved . Gwendoline Amelia Bertus was born in Colombo ( Ceylon ) on 27 October 1922 to parents Llewellyn ( Lula ) Bertus and Emma James . Gwen is the oldest sibling of a family of eight children , Pam Koch ( dec ) , Cynthia Pereira ( dec ) , Herbert Bertus ( dec ) , Dickie Bertus ( dec ) , Ron Bertus ( dec ) , Dulcie Namasiyavan ( dec ) and Bernard Bertus . Growing up in Sri Lanka , Gwen attended St Matthew 's College , Baseline Road , Borella , and on completing her education worked as a stenographer in legal firms until this quiet , demure lady met and fell in love with Lloyd Pietersz , a dashing , swashbuckling young policeman , much to the surprise of her family . They say opposites attract and after a whirlwind courtship they were married in 30 October 1943 at Holy Cross Church , Slave Island . Husband , Inspector Lloyd Pietersz , was stationed at the Kalutara Police Training School and the family lived in Kalutara where Gwen brought up her family of five boys and one girl , Randy , Cheryl , Tregartha , Desmond , Geoffrey and Glenn . In later years when Lloyd secured the prestigious job of Bodyguard to the former Prime Minister of Sri Lanka , Mrs Sirimavo Bandaranaike , the family moved to Colombo and lived in Police accommodation opposite Parliament House ( where the Intercontinental Hotel now stands ) . Gwen and Lloyd migrated to Melbourne in 1974 and lived for many years in Bayswater in a staff bungalow when Lloyd found employment in security at Fibremakers Bayswater , and then moved to Ringwood when they purchased their home . While she did n't work in the corporate world in Melbourne , Gwen had the reputation of being a gracious host , busy with house duties , keeping a nice home for her husband , unmarried sons and mother . She always had food on hand when family or friends dropped by and nobody left hungry without a taste of her delicious Sri Lankan home cooked meals or hidden treats for grandchildren . She would wake up early each morning before the household stirred to cook meals for “ whoever may visit ” , she used to say , and by the end of the day , that food had disappeared because she would have fed so many family members or friends who visited . A pint-sized lady , she ruled her male dominated household with a firm but fair hand – a much-loved mother , mother-in-law , grandmother and later great–grandmother . In the tradition of old , one could always find her dressed immaculately – nothing casual with how she presented herself to the world , whether in the home or in public . Every occasion was an excuse to buy a new outfit , do her hair and paint her nails , and everybody knew this and indulged her , the end result being that there was always a beautiful ‘ my fair lady ' at the parties she attended . Even as she grew older and her family expanded , she maintained her position as matriarch and the pivotal point of contact for her family – one could always be sure to find a visitor at the meeting place , her home . Her family Christmases was , and still are , big and extra special events when furniture has to be moved to make room for the new generations who do not want ( or dare ) to miss their mum/nana/gran-gran 's Christmas Eve family celebrations . When the modern way appears to be to give combined presents or reduce present-giving at Christmastime , even at her ripe old age , she makes it a point to shop herself ( in later years with the help of her daughter ) for a present for each and every child , grandchild and great-grandchild , and even close friends who come to her home on 24th December . She loves Christmas and still keeps the traditions of old , giving everybody and her Australian-born family , an insight into how Christmas was celebrated in Sri Lanka , or Ceylon , as she wants to remember it by . When she could no longer live in the family home on her own , Gwen moved to live with her daughter in Ringwood and now resides with a son in Wantirna , still sharp of mind , still able to laugh heartily at a joke her sons make of her funny traditions , and still busy watching old western movies , completing crosswords ( and winning ) in magazines like That 's Life , buying Tattslotto without fail each week ( and winning ) and always playing the machines at the pokies ( and winning ) . The family 's long-standing mirthful recollections which bring a hearty laugh from Gwen is when they remind her of her ability to forget her aches and pains and difficulty moving fast the minute she gets an offer from a son or friend to go to the pokies . Her speed automically picks up and she is virtually jumping into the car , with her departing laughing comment ” have car , will travel ” and off to the pokies goes this winner to come back with a heavier handbag than the one she set off with . Gwen 's one desire it to reach the grand old age of one hundred , just so she can get a letter from the Queen ( she is such a die-hard Royalist ) and everyone wishes her this heart 's desire . The family laugh that the congratulatory letter might be from King Charles , to which Gwen smiles knowingly . We know she 's thinking “ who cares ” as long as it is from Royalty . Family , friends and in-laws wish Gwen a happy and healthy life and her dream to be one hundred . God bless this much loved lady !

“ Forcing people of Kashmir into submission by using dictatorial and oppressive means is only daydream of Indian leaders and their Kashmiri stooges , ” said the joint resistance leadership ( JRL ) on Saturday .
The JRL comprising Syed Ali Geelani , Mirwaiz Umar Farooq and Muhammad Yasin Malik in a statement said “ the spree of arrests , nocturnal and day time raids , imposition of curfew and restrictions and other oppressive tactics are glaring example of the farce Indian democracy in Jammu Kashmir ” .
The gruesome killings in south Kashmir 's Shopian district and a complete ban on mourning are not only inhuman but the acts of state sponsored terrorism , ” the leaders said . Authorities on Friday foiled the Shopian Chalo programme announced by the JRL by preventing Syed Ali Geelani and Mirwaiz Umar Farooq to march from their residences . Both leaders defied house arrest and tried to march towards Shopian . However , Muhammad Yasin Malik succeeded in reaching Shopian where he addressed people at Jamia Masjid . He was arrested outside the grand mosque .
In a statement , Geelani , Mirwaiz and Malik said , “ The farce of Indian democracy in Jammu Kashmir yet again stands exposed before the international community and people of India as ( New Delhi ) and its Kashmiri stooges chose to choke people 's voices by military might . ”
“ This was a peaceful protest against crackdowns , hooliganism and oppression unleashed by Indian occupational forces in Shopian , Kulgam , Islamabad ( Anantnag ) , Pulwama , Tral , Qazigund , Bijbehara and many other places in southern parts of valley ; Bandipora , Hajin , Sumbal , Naidkhai in Sonawari , Kupwara , and Handwara in northern parts ; Ganderbal , Budgam and Srinagar in central Kashmir. ” —KR

Thankfully , to this point , our area has been fortunate . And , radar and short range model trends are encouraging , too ! The latest runs of our high resolution model output are trending farther northward with the line of storms . We 've said all along this was an all or nothing forecast , and evidence is growing that for at least MOST of our area , this will be a whole lot of nothing .
I 've adjusted our forecast maps to reflect our latest thinking .
We 'll maintain a risk over our northeastern counties - Coosa , Tallapoosa , Chambers . South of there , the risk is n't zero - but it 's low and getting lower with each passing hour .
Stay weather aware - this is n't an all-clear . But , it IS an encouraging trend ...
Make sure you know where to go when severe weather strikes . Have a plan , know your plan and go over your plan . Remember in the event of a tornado , go to the lowest floor of your home , the innermost room away from winds . Have a helmet , pillow or anything else that would protect your head . If you live in a mobile home making plans to wait out the storms in a storm shelter or a site built structure . Continue to stay updated as we continue to provide updates and tweaks to the forecast .

New Delhi : The country 's second largest IT services firm Infosys on Wednesday said it has completed the acquisition of US-based WongDoody .
In April , Infosys had said it will acquire WongDoody Holding Company , a US-based digital creative and consumer insights agency , for a total consideration of up to $ 75 million .
“ Infosys has concluded the acquisition for a consideration up to $ 75,040,000 including conditional deferred consideration and employee retention amounts , ” Infosys said in a BSE filing on Wednesday .
It added that the acquisition—which is in accordance with the terms set out in the agreement announced by the company in April—brings globally recognised creative talent and deep marketing and brand engagement expertise to Infosys .
“ Through this acquisition , Infosys enhances its digital experience services ecosystem with services ranging from strategy , design and user experience , to creative and digital marketing across the customer experience value chain , ” it said .
It added the transaction will also help Infosys further expand its worldwide network of digital studios . Founded in 1993 , WongDoody is headquartered in Seattle and has an office in Los Angeles .
Its has clients across industries like telecommunications , consumer electronics , healthcare and consumer packaged goods .
SAN FRANCISCO — Amazon 's annual shareholders meeting began at 9 a.m. in Seattle 's funky Fremont neighborhood today , with about 150 people inside and another 50 or so outside protesting .
After the shareholders entered the building , drag queens outside prepared to stage a flash dance as they agitated for Amazon to only consider states with strong gay rights laws for its second headquarters , while busloads of pilots for Amazon freight flights arrived to protest low staffing levels .
The event is generally fairly low-key on the inside , with CEO Jeff Bezos giving an overview of the previous year to around 100 shareholders .
The protests are expected to be raucous enough that the Washington State Department of Transportation listed two potential traffic issues in the region in its Wednesday morning tweet — the Amazon demonstrations in Seattle and band Maroon 5 performing in Tacoma .
This year the No Gay , No Way group , which is pushing the company to only place its second headquarters in states with strong gay rights laws , has local drag queens strutting outside while airplane-drawn banners float through the sky above the meeting .
Pilots for Amazon Air cargo , who fly Amazon cargo jets for Atlas Air and ABX Air , are attending to protest inadequate staffing levels , which they say makes for difficult working conditions .
Air cargo pilots for Amazon Air arrive by bus at Amazon 's 2018 annual shareholders meeting to protest what they describe as understaffing issues .
Conor Gaughan
An activist group called SumOfUs is also waging a campaign in support of a proposal to separate the roles of CEO and chairman of the board at Amazon . Jeff Bezos holds both positions .
More : How to listen to what Amazon 's Alexa has recorded in your home
It plans to hire a plane to fly over the meeting trailing a banner that reads , “ Bezos Needs a Boss . ”
It 's not uncommon for one person to hold the position of both CEO and board chair in a company , especially in the case of companies that have grown quickly and in which the founder is still serving in those positions , as is the case with Amazon .
However , it 's becoming more common for companies to separate the jobs of board chair and CEO , especially when the CEO owns a large stake in the company as Bezos does .
The concern is that if the roles are both filled by the same person , there is no one tasked with focusing on the will of the non-stake holding shareholders . A board led by an independent chair is presumed to be better able to focus on the mandate of the corporation to serve the needs of shareholders .
Other groups protesting at the shareholders meeting include the Service Employees International Union , climate justice group 350 Seattle , the Socialist Alternative socialist political party and community members angry at the negative impacts they say Amazon has had on their communities also plan to demonstrate .
Another proposal being put forward at the meeting asks that Amazon commit to a version of the Rooney Rule and include women and minorities when it interviews for open board positions . Currently Amazon 's board is made up of seven men and three women , all white .
Amazon had originally opposed the measure but two weeks ago the board shifted course , adopting as policy the inclusion of a diverse slate of candidates for director openings .
Jesse Jackson was in Seattle for the board meeting . Reached by USA TODAY , he said , `` leadership comes from the top down , '' and that he was eager for Amazon to make sure its board was n't all white .
Amazon declined to comment on the protests .

MONTREAL—The Montreal International Jazz Festival is cancelling the remaining presentations of a show that has been criticized because it features a white woman singing songs composed by Black slaves . The festival says it is apologizing to anyone who was hurt by the decision to put on the shows .
Renowned Quebec playwright Robert Lepage directed the controversial SLAV , all performances of which have been cancelled by the Montreal International Jazz Festival . ( René Johnston / Toronto Star )
“ Since the beginning of SLAV performances , the festival team has been shaken and strongly affected by all comments received , ” it said in a statement Wednesday . “ For the Festival international de Jazz de Montreal , inclusion and reconciliation between communities is essential . We made the decision with the artist Betty Bonifassi to cancel all performances of the show at the festival. ” The decision comes a day after U.S. musician Moses Sumney cancelled a gig at the jazz festival to protest the SLAV shows .

At the premiere last week , about 75 protesters staged a demonstration outside the theatre that was hosting the performance , which was directed by renowned Quebec playwright Robert Lepage . Police had to form a cordon to block protesters in order to allow people to enter . Bonifassi , a Montreal-based singer known for her Oscar-nominated work on the soundtrack of Les Triplettes de Belleville , was the main performer . Lepage and Bonifassi earlier released a joint statement on Facebook in which they said , “ Yes , the history of slavery , in all its various forms , belongs first and foremost to those who have been oppressed and to the descendants of those people . “ Diversity and its artistic potential are at the heart of SLAV as much as the legacy of slavery . Do we have the right to tell these stories ? Audience members will have the opportunity to decide after having seen the show . ”
Travel writer Jan Henderson appreciates a welcome return to the popular Italian ski resort .
NEVER go back , they say – but whoever “ they ” are , I suspect they have never been skiing in Sestriere . I 've been back to the Italian resort three times now – it 's been great each time , and I 'll go back again if I get the chance .
My most recent visit was in early February this year , courtesy of Crystal Ski Holidays and the Vialattea tourist office – and in a season blighted by a lack of good early snow , our visit was blessed with an abundance of the white stuff , with a big dump of snow just before we arrived . Fresh snow and clear blue skies will obviously make any ski resort look its best , but I have skied Sestriere and the Vialattea ( Milky Way ) when snow conditions have been less than great , and the resort 's north-west facing runs and high position ( 2040 metres , with the highest lift at 2840 metres ) usually mean that there 's still plenty of good skiing to be enjoyed .
The recent snowfall meant that our coach struggled to reach the resort , as the driver was reluctant to put on the snow chains after the two-hour or so transfer from Turin airport – but we eventually slithered through to arrive at the welcoming Hotel du Col . The low-rise hotel must be the best placed in the resort for skiers as it is literally at the foot of the slopes , with a selection of chairlifts just a short walk from the boot room .
The recently-refurbished hotel has stylish , modern and comfortable twin , triple , quad and single en-suite rooms to suit a variety of group needs , while the large self-service restaurant offers regional and Italian specialities to suit every taste . The bar downstairs is a congenial place to while away an hour or two and swap ski stories with your friends and other guests .
If you are looking for serious nightlife , Sestriere is probably not the place to be – Souze d'Oulx , pretty much next-door in the Vialattea ski area , is famous/notorious for that – but that 's not to say Sestriere has no après ski or places to go when the lifts shut for the day . Liveliest is GFC ( Gargote Fashion Café ) , accessible by ski or a short walk up the slope from the resort , which aims to be an Italian-style Folie Douce après ski party/music venue , and gets very busy indeed as the day 's skiing draws to a close , but also has themed events in the evenings .
However , if you prefer your après ski a little more restrained , a stroll around town will show plenty of bars and restaurants . The Italians love their food , and the restaurants reflect this , with destinations to reflect most tastes and budget . Our group was fortunate to eat out one evening at the splendid Principe di Piemonte hotel on the edge of town – also available on Crystal 's hotel roster – where the food for guests is a cut above , and that 's without venturing into their gourmet Belle Epoque restaurant .
The passion for good food extends to the slopes themselves , where there are plenty of places to stop off for anything from a hot chocolate or a beer to a full lunch . The Refugio Aquila Nera , easily accessed in the centre of the Bancetta Bowl above Sestriere , and the Ristorante Monte Triplex in Sportina both did our little group proud with extensive arrays of local and traditional delicacies – fuelling us up for a few more hours of afternoon skiing .
Which leads me neatly to the skiing itself – after all , that 's the main reason you 'll be spending your hard-earned cash to visit the resort . The majority of British skiers heading to the slopes each winter fall into the intermediate category – and Sestriere , and indeed the whole Vialattea area , is intermediate heaven . The area lift pass covers the massive 400 kilometre Milky Way area , with 109 of the 200-plus runs designated intermediate , and these range from the high , open Olympic runs well above the tree line at the top of Sestriere to long wooded pistes down towards the Borgata area . There 's a similar mix of terrains across the whole area , and an average intermediate will have no trouble skiing across to the other main resorts of Pragelato , Sansicario , Cesan , Claviere and the aforementioned Souze d'Oulx .
The far reaches of the Vialattea even stretch across the border to the French resort of Montgenevre – well worth a visit , but includes a number of long , often chilly chairlifts . A better option is to take advantage of the away-day Crystal excursion – a 45 minute coach ride that gets you to Montgenevre as the lifts open and gives you a full day on their pistes , rather than spending a good part of the day trekking there and back .
For more advanced skiers the huge Amfiteatro bowl offers excellent skiing , and the black runs at the top of Motta and Sises provide a challenge for experts . The famous Kandahar Slalom and Kandahar Banchetta runs are used in World Championship races . I 'm no off-piste skier myself , but am reliably informed that Sestriere has plenty of off-piste opportunities . The Monginevro Pass has a lot of easily accessible bowls from the lifts or with a short hike on skins , while the route down to Pragelato involves a lovely open bowl at the beginning followed by some exciting lines through a larch forest .
For beginners , slopes fan out in an arc from the ski school meeting place in the centre of Sestriere – right next to the Hotel du Col - with easy runs from the two baby lifts and the Jolly , while to the right of the area are two drag lifts , ideal for first timers .
A six day high season area pass , which covers all lifts on the Italian side of the Milky Way area plus one day skiing in Montgenèvre , is £166 for adults and £31 for a child under seven – actually pretty reasonable for 400-odd kilometres of piste when you compare it with about £250 for a six day Tignes/Val d'Isere pass or £265 for the Trois Vallees in France .
Add the relaxed , genuinely welcoming Italian atmosphere to the fantastic skiing , comfortable hotels coupled with great food and drink and you 'll quickly see why so many Brits – myself included – are happy to keep going back to Sestriere .
Jan Henderson travelled to Sestriere with Crystal Ski Holidays ( www.crystalski.co.uk ; 020 8610 3123 ) , who offer a week 's half board at the four-star Hotel du Col in Sestriere , Italy , from £689 per person ( based on two sharing ) including flights from Gatwick to Turin and transfers ( price given is for departure on 8 April 2018 ) . Direct flights available from all major UK airports .

Exploitation of wind , solar power
Islamabad
The Pakistan Economy Watch ( PEW ) on Sunday said we have matchless potential to produce electricity with the help of solar and wind but it is not getting due attention . Pakistan can not only produce electricity sufficient for national needs but also export power saving oil import bill and earning foreign exchange .
The world has entered in the golden era of gas therefore the share of gas in the energy mix should be enhanced , said Dr. Murtaza Mughal , President PEW . He said that government should take steps to keep at least twenty percent difference in the prices of petrol and CNG while all the projects to generate electricity from gas should be completed on a fast track .
Dr. Murtaza Mughal said that we highly value the efforts and vision of Minister for Petroleum Shahid Khaqan Abbasi who has been working hard to tame energy crisis .
He said that cost of producing electricity through gas is six cents per unit while hydel power costs three times which is eighteen cents per unit . Moreover , hydel projects take a lot of time and it costs 4.5 million dollar per megawatt . Government should not ignore the potential of renewable energy as we can generate 50 thousand megawatts of electricity by harnessing wind power while the potential of solar power is matchless , he added .
He said that these sources of energy can satisfy all the needs of energy while surplus power can also be exported to save oil import bill and earn foreign exchange .
He said that some estimates suggest that share of renewable energy in global energy will rise by 100 percent during the next 14 years but the pace of work inPakistan is not satisfactory.—INP
KARACHI : Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah on Monday said that under the National Water Policy ( NWP ) no new water storage/dam on River Indus would be acceptable until and unless a consensus was developed among all the stakeholders , particularly the lower riparian .
This he said while presiding over a preparatory meeting for Council of Common Interest ( CCI ) 's scheduled meeting to be held in Islamabad in which National Water Policy would be discussed .
Briefing the CM , Secretary Irrigation Jama Shah said that the amendment proposed by the Sindh government had been incorporated in the proposed NWP .
The distribution as elaborated shall be proportionately adjusted and distributed to provinces accordingly , said the chief minister adding that he would take up the issue again in the CCI meeting .

The secretary irrigation said that the amendment proposed by Murad Shah that ‘ provinces are responsible for routine repair and maintenance of flood protection dykes , flood fighting and drainage . However , in case of cataclysm like 2010 flood , the federal government will provide supplementary funds , ' has not been incorporated in the revised draft policy . On this the chief minister said that the proposed amendment was necessary and he would again take it up .
The CM was also told that his amendment ` Build large dams for system augmentation in consensus with all federating units , ' has not been incorporated . On this he said that he was writing a letter to the prime minister requesting to formulate a policy under which new storage/dams would not be allowed without the consensus , particularly of the lower riparian .
He said that the preface of the NWP should be “ This National Water Policy recognizes the internationally accepted right of lower riparian on water . Any diversions/intervention in the smooth flow of water would not be allowed until and unless the consensus of all federating units , particularly the lower riparian is achieved , ” he dictated the note to the secretary irrigation .
Murad Ali Shah said that Sindh and Balochistan had already faced serious water issues . The construction of new storages/dams would further cause devastation , he added .
“ We would not accept the new water policy until and unless our proposed amendment is incorporated in the new policy , ” he said .
Another amendment as proposed by the Sindh government is as follows : “ A National Water Council ( NWC ) shall be established with the composition : the prime minister in the chair , the federal water & power minister , federal minister for climate change , federal minister of national food security & research , deputy commission planning & commission , chief ministers of provinces , provincial irrigation ministers , private sectors members from water related disciplines as members and advisors/chairman Federal Flood Commission would be secretary of the council . The prime minister of Azad and Jammu Kashmir ( AJK ) and chief minister of Gilgit-Balitistan along with their irrigation or agricultural ministers will be invited to the meeting of NWC as observers . ”
The functions of the NWC will be as follows :
a ) Review and coordinate implementation of national water policy and national water sector strategy in the country and periodic updating of the same .
b ) Recommend legislation , policies and strategies for water resources development and management in the country ;
c ) National planning and coordination for water resources , development and management activities among concerned organizations at federal as well as provincial government level to achieve objective of NWP ;
d ) Create an enabling environment that shall promote broader multi stakeholders participation and integrated water resources management with due consideration for environment and ecology .
e ) Coordinate with concerned organization responsible for controlling pollution of water bodies , including rivers , streams , lakes and ground water .
f ) Managing centralized water resources database service ; and
g ) Any other functions , which the ICC may assign to the council .
Murad Ali Shah said that all the suggestions should be incorporated in the NWP . “ I would take up all these issues in the meeting with the objective to safeguard the rights of smaller provinces , particularly the lower riparian . ”

Waterloo Regional Police said they were called to the Charles Street school at 11:30 a.m. because of a note that pointed to `` an act of violence . ''
Police said no evidence was found to support the threat .
Police , along with the school , are attempting to find the author of the note .
Amazon 's AWS cloud computing service hosted its annual NY Summit today and it used the event to launch a new service : Amazon Macie . The idea behind Macie is to use machine learning to help businesses protect their sensitive data in the cloud . For now , you can use Macie to protect personally identifiable information and intellectual property in the Amazon S3 storage service , with support for other AWS data stores coming later this year ( likely at the re : Invent conference in November ) .
The company says that the fully managed service uses machine learning to monitor how data is accessed and to look for any anomalies . The service then alerts users of any activity that looks suspicious so that they can find the root cause of any data leaks ( whether those are malicious or not ) . To do all of this , the service continuously monitors new data that comes into S3 . It then uses machine learning to understand regular access patterns and the data in the storage bucket .
The service also automatically detects certain data types like full names , addresses , credit card numbers , IP addresses , driver license IDs ( US only ) , social security numbers and birth dates , but it can also automatically detect different content types ( email , SEC forms , data logs , database backups , source code , etc . ) .
All of this data then flows into a central dashboard that highlights high-risk files and other information about how users and other applications are accessing data .
As with all AWS services , pricing is complicated , but mostly based on the number of events and data the service processes every month . Because a lot of cost are bound to the initial classification of the data , the first month of usage is also likely the most expensive .
For now , Macie is only available in AWS 's US East ( Northern Virginia ) and US West ( Oregon ) regions , though this footprint will likely expand over time .
It 's worth noting that Amazon also announced that Glue , the company 's service for preparing and loading data into its various database and storage services , is now available to all customers . In addition , the company used today 's event to launch a new migration hub for enterprises that want to migrate some of their workloads to the cloud , as well as updates to the Elastic File System ( now with encryption at rest ) , AWS Config and AWS CloudHSM for better key management .
The government says U.S. airlines canceled fewer flights in 2016 than any year on record while also posting record-low numbers for lost bags and passengers getting bumped off oversold flights .
And it says airlines had one of their best years for on-time arrivals , although it was n't a record and December was worse than the same month a year earlier .
The Transportation Department reported Tuesday that the 12 leading U.S. airlines canceled 1.17 percent of flights last year , the lowest rate among comparable figures going back to 1995 . The previous best was 1.24 percent in 2002 , when travel decreased after the terror attacks of Sept. 11 , 2001 .
So you might think it 's all upgrades and free snacks in the air . Travelers know better .

Airlines have added extra fees for many things that used to be included in the ticket price . Changing a ticket ? That will cost you up to $ 200 , depending on the airline , and even more for international flights .
Average legroom has been shrinking for years . To squeeze in more seats , the cushions are getting thinner . Air travel is less egalitarian  the biggest airlines boast about fancy new seats and other amenities for passengers in the premium cabins , but they are also introducing `` basic economy '' fares that in some cases do n't let coach passengers use the overhead bins .
Still , air travel is first about getting quickly from one place to another . And the airlines seem to be doing a better job of that .
The Transportation Department says 81.4 percent of domestic flights arrived on-time , which the government defines as within 15 minutes of the scheduled time . That was the fourth-best year since 1995 . But December 's on-time rate of 75.6 percent was down from 77.8 percent in the previous December .
Hawaiian Airlines , Alaska Airlines and Delta Air Lines had the best on-time rates for the full year . December 's leaders were Hawaiian , Delta and American Airlines . Spirit Airlines ranked last for 2016 , but rival budget carrier Frontier Airlines was last in December .
The bad news was that there were more long delays in any year since 2013 . There were 84 domestic flights last year that sat on the ground for more than three hours , and 36 international flights that waited at least four hours  long enough on all those flights that the government could fine the airlines .
The airlines reported that one bag was lost , stolen or delayed for every 370 passengers , the best rate since the Transportation Department started tracking the figure in 1987 . Virgin America had the lowest rate of mishandled bags in 2016 , while ExpressJet mishandled bags most often .

The white cloud juxtaposed next to a wondrous blue sky would make this a pretty picture on its own , add this most dramatic setting and it becomes even more impressive .
The fist-shaped rock resembles some kind of giant sculpture carved from the earth and those of you who have been here before will instantly recognise this striking landscape as Brimham Rocks , in North Yorkshire .
Situated on a hill overlooking Summerbridge and Lower Nidderdale , Brimham Rocks are a series of weird and wonderfully shaped millstone grit outcrops , sculpted by erosion during the last ice age .
Balancing like circus artists frozen in time , the rocks stand up to 30 metres tall in places and create a labyrinth of paths through the landscape . As befits such an unusual sight these rock formations have equally intriguing names , so next time you 're there try and spot the Dancing Bear , the Smartie Tube and the Camel .
At this time of year the stark , barren landscape can appear even more striking and is an ideal place to blow the cobwebs away and help walk off some of that post-Christmas excess while enjoying some of our finest countryside .
The land , part of the Nidderdale Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty , is owned by the National Trust and generations of families and climbers have travelled here over the years to enjoy the soaring views out across Nidderdale .
The allure does n't stop there . Brimham Rocks were the inspiration behind an artwork shortlisted for a place on the Fourth Plinth in Trafalgar Square back in 2013 .
Artist Marcus Coates created the piece , entitled Unmade Monument , as an exact model of the Eagle , one of the rocks here . They have also made some unlikely cameos over the years having appeared in a couple of children 's TV shows and featured in the Bee Gees ' video for their number one hit single You Win Again – a grand , if slightly incongruous , location for a pop song .

“ Despite this , the committee was informed by the government that there were few takers and in view of the scheme 's lack of popularity with the intended beneficiaries , it was felt there was little point in continuing with it . The Committee reluctantly noted the Government 's decision , ” Dr Shashi Tharoor , head of Parliamentary Standing Committee on External Affairs , told Gulf News .
An Indian newspaper reported on Monday that the scheme attracted less than 300 subscribers in four years . A social worker said both the previous and present governments did not make enough efforts to popularise the scheme . “ It was the best scheme introduced by the Indian Government for the workers because government also contributed money for each worker joining the scheme , ” K. V Shamsuddin , Chairman of Pravasi Bandhu Welfare Trust , a welfare organisation for expatriates , told Gulf News on Monday . He said the government had to make efforts to reach out to workers and educate them about the benefits of the scheme . “ Unfortunately , it did not happen , ” Shamsuddin said . An executive of a financial firm , which was entrusted with enrolling workers , said certain moves were already there in 2015 to discontinue the scheme . “ One part of the scheme was withdrawn in 2015 . Then it was not possible to market the scheme in that shape , ” he said . Mahatma Gandhi Pravasi Suraksha Yojana ( MGPSY ) MGPSY was attractive with Government 's contribution in the scheme . For a minimum annual contribution of Rs5,000 ( around Dh275 ) from a worker , the government was supposed to contribute Rs3,900 and Rs2,900 for female and male workers respectively . Indian Government offered to provide a contribution of up to Rs2,000 ( Dh110 ) per year for male workers and Rs3,000 ( Dh165 ) per year to women workers for up to either five years or until the worker returns home , whichever is earlier . The proposed contribution would flow to the individual account of each eligible subscriber . The workers have to contribute between Rs1,000 ( Dh55 ) and Rs12,000 per annum towards pension fund and Rs4,000 towards return and resettlement fund . They would derive corresponding benefits when they go back home and during their old age Workers between the age of 18 and 50 who hold a Emigration Clearance Required ( ECR ) passports are eligible to enrol in the scheme .

MEXICO CITY ( Reuters ) - Mexico 's Foreign Minister Luis Videgaray told a news conference on Friday that Mexico 's relationship with the United States is tighter with Donald Trump 's government than previous administrations .
“ I think in many ways the relationship today is more fluid , it 's closer than it was with previous administrations , which might be surprising to some people but that 's a fact of life , ” said Mexico 's top diplomat .
Videgaray spoke alongside U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Canada 's Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland in Mexico City .
Freeland said that uncertainty around renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement was not good for business , but that it was important to get it right .
As Videgaray , a former finance minister and longtime aide of President Enrique Pena Nieto , put a good face on U.S.-Mexico relations , he also acknowledged some tensions .
“ We do have some differences , as every other country does , but we 've been working very closely , ” said Videgaray . “ We 're looking to the future . ”

AMSTERDAM ( Reuters ) - Daimler 's new Mercedes A-Class , unveiled on Friday , includes the German automaker 's own machine-learning and voice recognition technology in one of the industry 's boldest attempts so far to take on Silicon Valley 's finest .
The Mercedes “ MBUX ” dashboard system to be rolled out across the lineup is about as capable at understanding what you say - and more importantly what you mean - as Amazon 's Alexa , Apple 's Siri or Alphabet 's Google Assistant .
Its debut comes as carmakers are embroiled in a tech arms race , raising questions about the ultimate profitability of new services that often duplicate those available on smartphones . Daimler itself warned on Thursday that 2018 profit growth would be dampened by technology investment .
Carmakers , especially premium manufacturers , are resisting the encroachment of tech giants on several fronts including autonomous driving and connected services - whose commercial potential multiplies with voice recognition and assistance .
“ It 's fine to have Google or Amazon voice apps sitting alongside the main one , but no car company wants the voice activation that controls the air con to be Alexa , ” said Mike Ramsey , a Detroit-based analyst with tech research firm Gartner .
The Daimler system “ narrows the gap with tech , ” Ramsey said . “ If it works as advertised , Mercedes will have set a new standard and given hope to other automakers that they can build a voice interface that actually works like Siri or Google . ”
Mercedes is updating its A-Class with a new look and engines , roomier interior and semi-autonomous driving features that can help pilot the car in highway traffic .
But its biggest draw is the MBUX system , presented on two large horizontal touch-screens that dispense entirely with dashboard instruments .
It uses artificial intelligence to make sense of commands and even anticipate them by learning the preferences and habits of up to eight different users . Spoken instructions can command everything from navigation to infotainment .
Other auto brands have taken a more affordable approach , often using “ mirroring ” , which grants access to smartphone apps via a touch-screen interface . Some also route vocal commands straight to Siri , Alexa or Google .
‘ NO CHOICE '
Daimler hopes customers already used to voice assistants wo n't miss Siri or Alexa when they climb aboard and must remember to preface requests with “ hey Mercedes ” instead .

The A-Class could be a test of whether carmakers can make bespoke voice assistants a selling point that customers are prepared to pay more for .
Daimler Chief Executive Dieter Zetsche rebuffed that idea .
“ We 've tested it already , ” he told reporters at the Amsterdam launch . “ We do n't test on our customers . ”
Unlike its cloud-based rivals , available only when online , the Mercedes assistant uses embedded software from Nuance Communications , a Massachussets-based voice recognition specialist , to continue functioning when data connections fail .

Mercedes declined to say whether the current A-Class starting price of 24,000 euros ( $ 30,000 ) would rise with the new model . But its profitability will , Zetsche insisted - citing axles among mechanical components where savings had been found to offset higher tech spending .
Carmakers now have “ no choice ” but to put their best technology into their smallest cars , Evercore analyst Arndt Ellinghorst said . “ Otherwise those cars would be uncompetitive . ”
“ Everyone 's using Waze for navigation on their mobile phones because onboard navigation systems are so outdated , ” he said . “ These things need to change . ”
The technology giants are pushing harder for dashboard space . Apple 's CarPlay mirroring service includes Siri and is now available on more than 200 vehicle models , while a three-year effort by Amazon has placed Alexa in Ford and Toyota cars .
Suppliers are also jostling . At the CES tech show in Las Vegas , Panasonic showcased an upgraded infotainment system based on Google software , allowing drivers to use voice commands to pull up directions or access some vehicle controls .
The growing interest among suppliers , and Nuance 's embedded software technology , may open the way for other carmakers to follow Daimler 's lead , Gartner 's Ramsey predicts .
“ Really slick integration of voice activation systems is the big tech thing we 're going to see in cars over the next couple of years , ” he said .

Cops hunting the killer of little Alesha MacPhail have urged families to keep a close eye on their kids and secure their homes .
`` Smiley '' Alesha , six , was reported missing from her grandmother 's home on the Isle of Bute , Scotland , at 6.25am on Monday .
Her body was found less than three hours later in woodland on the site of a former hotel in Rothesay by a member of the public .
Last night , police revealed the schoolgirl 's death was being treated as murder , following a post-mortem , the Daily Record reports .

Officers have asked people on the island to be `` vigilant '' about their children and household security as the murder inquiry continues .
Area police commander , Chief Superintendent Hazel Hendren , said yesterday : `` Our absolute priority is catching the person responsible for this horrendous act as quickly as possible .
`` I understand that there will be a high level of concern among people living in this close-knit community , but I want to reassure people that everything possible is being done .
`` Incidents such as this are extremely rare , but we are still in the early stages of this investigation and we would ask people to be vigilant about their children and also their household security .

`` The island community needs to pull together at times like this and we need their help - anyone with any information , please come forward . ''
Detective Superintendent Stuart Houston confirmed police were `` treating Alesha 's death as a murder investigation '' .
“ This has obviously progressed over the last couple of days in relation to our investigations , '' he said last night .
“ Alesha 's family are utterly devastated by the news we have had to give them this evening . We are continuing to provide them with support at this incredibly distressing time .
“ Alesha had lots of friends who will no doubt find it very difficult to comprehend why they will never see their friend again .
( Image : Daily Record )
( Image : Daily Record )
“ Like any other six-year-old , Alesha was looking forward to enjoying her holidays from primary school and was only a few days into a three-week summer break visiting relatives on the island .
“ For such a young girl to have her life taken away is incomprehensible . ”
Det Supt Houston said officers were trying to piece together a timeline from when Alesha went missing from her grandparents ' home near Rothesay to the discovery of her body .
The schoolgirl , a `` very friendly '' and `` considerate '' child , was found on the site of the derelict hotel in Ardbeg Road at around 9am .
Formal identification of the body was confirmed by Police Scotland .
Earlier yesterday , the youngster 's devastated mum Georgina Lochrane , 23 , sobbed uncontrollably as police escorted her to see tributes that had been laid for her daughter outside the flat .

Georgina , whom Alesha lived with in Coatbridge , placed a school photograph of her little girl beside the flowers .
It is understood the mum carried out a formal identification of her daughter 's body after it was taken to the mainland .
Alesha 's dad Robert MacPhail , who is estranged from Georgina , also went to see the tributes to his daughter yesterday .
He was supported by his girlfriend , Tonii Mclachlan .
Yesterday afternoon , forensic teams were working at Alesha 's gran Angela King 's flat in Port Bannatyne . Another team of officers in white suits removed a vehicle from the island on a recovery truck .
Meanwhile , part of the beachfront in front of Angela 's home was cordoned off with police tape .
Robert 's brother Calum MacPhail , 26 , paid tribute to his niece .
He wrote on Facebook yesterday : “ I have been up all night thinking of how to word this as I have received many messages in the last 20 hours or so .
“ Alesha was the most wonderful niece I could have asked for . She always brought happiness to my day and anyone she was around . ”
Wendy Davie , head of Chapelside Primary School in Airdrie , where Alesha was a pupil , described her as “ considerate ” and “ popular ” .
She said : “ Alesha started with us at Chapelside Primary in August 2016 and had just finished primary two .
“ She loved being at school and enjoyed all aspects of literacy , in particular writing .
“ She was such a perfectionist in her handwriting and was very proud of her work .
“ Alesha was very friendly and she welcomed everyone first thing in the morning at breakfast club .

“ She was a very considerate child who loved being part of a group and she was popular with all the other children and was a smiley and happy young girl . She was part of the family of Chapelside Primary and she will be greatly missed by everyone . ”
Police said a significant amount of information had been gathered by officers working on the investigation and many people had come forward with information .
Det Supt Houston added : “ While we have had a very encouraging response from our appeal , I would continue to appeal to those who took part in the search for Alesha when she was reported missing . Those individuals may have critical information . ”
Alesha went missing while she was staying with her dad and Angela , 46 . On Monday , her grandmother shared an appeal on Facebook saying Alesha was missing and urging people to look for her .
At home in Coatbridge , Georgina reacted to initial reports of the discovery of a body on Facebook .
She wrote : “ Someone tells me what 's happening . That 's my daughter . ”
CHARLOTTESVILLE , Va. ( Reuters ) - A gathering of hundreds of white nationalists in Virginia took a deadly turn on Saturday when a car plowed into a group of counter-protesters and killed at least one person in a flare up of violence that challenged U.S. President Donald Trump .
The state 's governor blamed neo-Nazis for sparking the unrest in the college town of Charlottesville , where rival groups fought pitched battles using rocks and pepper spray after far-right protesters converged to demonstrate against a plan to remove a statue to a Confederate war hero .
A car slammed into a crowd of people , killing a 32-year-old woman , police said . Video on social media and Reuters photographs showed the car hit a large group of counter-protesters , sending some flying into the air .
Federal authorities opened a civil rights investigation into the death .
Two Virginia policeman died in a helicopter crash nearby after assisting efforts to quell the clashes .
Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe , a Democrat , declared an emergency and halted a white nationalist rally , while President Donald Trump condemned the violence .
`` I have a message to all the white supremacists and the Nazis who came into Charlottesville today . Our message is plain and simple : go home , '' McAuliffe told a news conference .
`` You are not wanted in this great commonwealth . Shame on you . ''
As midnight approached , the streets of Charlottesville had gone quiet .
The clashes highlight how the white supremacist movement has resurfaced under the `` alt-right '' banner after years in the shadows of mainstream American politics .
Trump said `` many sides '' were involved , drawing fire from across the political spectrum for not specifically denouncing the far right . The violence presented Trump with perhaps the first domestic crisis of his young administration .
`` We 're closely following the terrible events unfolding in Charlottesville , Virginia , '' Trump told reporters at his New Jersey golf course .
`` We condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred , bigotry and violence on many sides . ''
Trump made no reply to a reporter 's shouted question whether he had spoken out strongly enough against white nationalists .
Police held a man from Ohio on charges relating to the car incident , including second-degree murder , said Martin Kumer , Albemarle Charlottesville 's regional jail superintendent .
The suspect was James Alex Fields , Jr. , a 20-year-old white man from Ohio , Kumer said . It was not clear why he was in Charlottesville , home to the University of Virginia 's flagship campus .
After hours of clashes , a silver sedan driving at high speed plowed into the crowd before reversing along the same street . The incident took place about two blocks from the park displaying the statue of Robert E. Lee , who headed the Confederate army in the American Civil War .
Five people suffered critical injuries and four had serious injuries from the car strike , officials said .
A civil rights investigation has been opened into the crash death , the U.S. Attorney 's Office for the Western District of Virginia and the FBI 's Richmond field office said late on Saturday .

`` The FBI will collect all available facts and evidence , '' they said in a joint statement .
Attorney General Jeff Sessions also condemned the violence in Charlottesville , vowing `` the full support of the Department of Justice '' for the U.S. Attorney 's office in a statement .
Three more men were arrested , Virginia State Police said late on Saturday night . Two 21-year-olds from Tennessee and Virginia were charged , one with disorderly conduct and the other with assault and battery , while a 44-year-old Florida man was arrested for carrying a concealed weapon .
'DOMESTIC TERRORISM ? '
Prominent Democrats , civil rights activists and some Republicans said it was inexcusable of the president not to denounce white supremacy .
`` Mr. President - we must call evil by its name , '' Republican U.S . Senator Cory Gardner wrote on social network Twitter .
Slideshow ( 12 Images )
`` These were white supremacists and this was domestic , '' said Gardner , chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee , the group charged with helping to get Republicans elected to the Senate .
Nancy Pelosi , the Democratic leader in the U.S. House of Representatives , said in a tweet directed at the president : `` Repeat after me , @ realDonaldTrump : white supremacy is an affront to American values . ''
Fighting broke out on Saturday in the city 's downtown , when hundreds of people , some wearing white nationalist symbols and carrying Confederate battle flags , were confronted by a nearly equal number of counter-protesters .
The Charlottesville City Council voted unanimously to allow the police chief to declare a curfew . No action on the move has been taken as midnight approached , Mayor Mike Signer said on his Facebook page .
The confrontation was a stark reminder of the growing political polarization since Trump 's election last year .
`` You will not erase us , '' chanted a crowd of white nationalists , while counter-protesters carried placards that read : `` Nazi go home '' and `` Smash white supremacy . ''
Scott Stroney , 50 , a catering sales director at the University of Virginia who arrived at the scene of the car incident just after the crash , said he was horrified .
`` I started to cry . I could n't talk for a while , '' he said . `` It was just hard to watch , hard to see . It 's heartbreaking . ''
The violence began on Friday night , when hundreds of white marchers with blazing torches appeared at the campus in a display that critics called reminiscent of a Ku Klux Klan rally .
David Duke , a former leader of the white supremacist Ku Klux Klan , was in Charlottesville for the rally , according to his Twitter account .
The rally was part of a long debate in the U.S. South over the Confederate battle flag and other symbols of the rebel side in the Civil War , which was fought over the issue of slavery .
The violence is the latest clash between far-rightists , some of whom have claimed allegiance to Trump , and the president 's opponents since his January inauguration , when black-clad anti-Trump protesters in Washington smashed windows , torched cars and clashed with police , leading to more than 200 arrests .
About two dozen people were arrested in Charlottesville in July when the Ku Klux Klan rallied against the plan to remove the Lee statue . Torch-wielding white nationalists also demonstrated against the decision in May .

WATFORD 3 LIVERPOOL 3
Aug 12 ( Reuters ) - Watford defender Miguel Britos scrambled in a stoppage-time equaliser to grab a 3-3 draw against Liverpool in an absorbing Premier League encounter on Saturday .
Britos stabbed home at the death after Liverpool had come from 1-0 and 2-1 down to lead 3-2 thanks to a three-minute blitz in the second half , when new signing Mohamed Salah made an impact .
Former Chelsea winger Salah , who joined Liverpool from AS Roma during the close season , won a penalty converted by Roberto Firmino in the 54th minute and then bundled in the Brazilian 's lofted pass from close range .
Liverpool 's Sadio Mane scored a classy equaliser to cancel out striker Stefano Okaka 's early header for Watford , but midfielder Abdoulaye Doucoure put the hosts 2-1 up in the first half after sloppy defending by Liverpool . ( Writing by Zoran Milosavljevic ; Editing by Toby Davis )

Naia Izumi is a 34-year-old musician from Columbus , Ga. who now lives in Los Angeles and busks on that city 's streets . With a plethora of self-released music on Bandcamp and a skilled , soulful Tiny Desk Contest submission , he impressed our Contest judges enough to stand out from nearly 5,000 entries .
Izumi 's submission for the contest , `` Soft Spoken , '' showcases both his undeniable talent and charismatic personality . Izumi was assigned male at birth and — though he currently identifies as male — identified as a woman for about seven years ( and originally titled the track `` Soft Spoken Woman '' ) . The song of his winning entry was written in order to try to address dealing with prejudices both social and artistic .
`` I was experiencing a lot of people [ who would ] just kind of over-talk me , or downplay my abilities because of how I presented myself , '' Izumi says .

Izumi got his first guitar as a child — he estimates he was between eight and 10 years old — and began to experiment immediately . Though he quickly became obsessed with making music , Izumi says was n't always encouraged to pursue his passion . While his mother , a part-time choir director , supported it , his father did n't want him to play . `` I had to hide that guitar in my closet , '' he remembers .
He now prides himself in making declarative music , writing songs that are a stark contrast to his timid personality — but Izumi , who has openly discussed living with autism , says that music is his refuge .
`` [ It 's ] having all this power that I can use to express myself , '' Izumi says , citing that he is a multi-instrumentalist and producer as well as a performer .
Having gone through so much for the love of music , Izumi welcomes the idea of being seen as a role model for young musicians in the wake of winning the Tiny Desk Contest .
`` Honestly , I 'm kind of ready for it , '' Izumi says . `` I get comments sometimes like , 'You 're so talented . ' It 's not talent , it 's work . It 's something anybody can do , you just have to put in the hours . ''

Union Minister of Textiles Smriti Irani stated that the country has achieved a lot of development in the last three years of the Narendra Modi-led government at the Centre .
She was speaking during her visit at Sankhali on Wednesday to address a programme ‘ Sabka Saath Sabka Vikas , ' organised by state BJP unit .
It was also attended by Union Minister of State for AYUSH ( independent charge ) Shripad Naik , Speaker Dr Pramod Sawant and other dignitaries of BJP Sankhali mandal .
The Textiles Minister lauded the Modi government for commissioning a railway line at Uchahar in Amethi district , the constituency of Gandhi family within just three years , which was never done by Congress despite ruling the nation for over last 60 years .
She said that around 10 crore poor people have got the benefit of LPG facility due to efforts of the Prime Minister Modi who has been appealing to middle-class families to give up LPG subsidy .
Shripad Naik , in his speech , stated that the AYUSH ministry has implemented innovative health-related programmes that will help people to live a long and disease-free life . He also made an announcement of constructing a 50-bed Ayurveda hospital in Velguem village under AYUSH ministry , the land for which has been donated by Speaker Dr Pramod Sawant .
Speaker Dr Sawant lauded Prime Minister Narendra Modi for implementing insurance scheme through which poor people can get natural or accidental death benefits by paying just Rs 12 and Rs 235 respectively . He added that the prime minister never compromised the safety and security of the country .
Instead of learning from their first-round playoff exit last year , the Montreal Canadiens have bottomed out as one of the worst teams in the league from day one of the 2017-18 season . They need a long hard look in the mirror and should n't like what they see . The fans do n't .
Is this year 's incarnation of the Habs the worst in franchise history ? That was a question on TSN 690 's morning show with Conor McKenzie , Rick Moffat , and Shaun Starr . To ask the question is to concede what we all know : this is a bad team with a terrible record . But is it really the worst team in franchise history ?
Yes .
The Case for the 2017-18 Team
The Canadiens started the season with a 1-6-1 record , matching their worst eight-game start in 76 years . Not since 1941-42 has the team started a season so poorly . They have been shut out 11 times this season , the most in franchise history . Last week , against the rival Toronto Maple Leafs , the team allowed 26 shots in one period , again the most in franchise history . They have lost 23 road games in regulation , another franchise record . In a league where scoring is at a premium , the team 's scoring differential is abysmal with 180 goals for and 224 goals against , which is on pace to be the worst in franchise history .
The stats provide one view , of course . An honest assessment of the roster provides another . The Canadiens lack talent at center and are slow on the blue line and there is no silver bullet in the pipeline .

Injuries and poor player management mean that the organization 's best prospects , like Victor Mete , are in the Habs lineup .
Things are so bad , the Brampton Beast of the ECHL may be regretting their affiliation with Montreal . It has turned into a one-way deal with the Laval Rocket taking players to replace those called up to the Habs . The Rocket have not sent a skater to the ECHL since October and , as a result , the Brampton Beast are at the bottom of the North Division outside of the playoff picture .
Other Contenders
There are only two other teams in recent memory that could compete with this team for the dubious distinction of being the worst in franchise history .
2000-01
The 2000-01 team was another horrendous team . They finished in last place with a 28-40-8 record . They scored 206 goals and allowed 232 . The franchise missed the playoffs for the third consecutive season while Saku Koivu and Oleg Petrov led the team with a measly 47 points each .
This is the team that many consider the worst in history and in terms of wins and losses it was . Like this year , the team suffered through injuries to key players with more than 500 man-games lost . The Habs dressed 42 different skaters and four different goalies in that season .
Unlike this year , however , injuries were not used as an excuse . Poor performance led to organizational changes . General Manager and Coach Rejean Houle and Alain Vigneault were fired early in the season and Andre Savard was made the new general manager and Michel Therrien became the head coach .
1994-95
In the shortened NHL lockout year , the Canadiens struggled and ended the season with an 18-23-7 record . Worse than that , they won only three of 24 games away from the Montreal Forum . The lack of offense was a key problem that season , prompting two significant trades .
The first , on Feb. 9 , 1995 , the Habs acquired forward Mark Recchi from the Philadelphia Flyers for Eric Desjardins and John LeClair . While Recchi was good , LeClair went on to become an All-Star power forward alongside Flyers superstar Eric Lindros .
The second occurred when Kirk Muller and defenseman Mathieu Schneider were traded to the New York Islanders for Pierre Turgeon and Vladimir Malakhov . It did n't work out . That year , the Habs missed the playoffs for the first time since 1970 .
The Early 1980s ?
Martin LeMay on TSN 690 suggested the early 1980s were tough years . While the Canadiens went from best in the league to merely average , these were far from bad teams . Despite the retirement of several key players , the Canadiens still won the Norris Division in 1980 amassing 107 points with a 47-20-13 record but lost in the second round of the playoffs .
In 1981 , the Canadiens won their 7th straight division title with a 45-22-13 record but were beaten by an up and coming Edmonton Oilers team led by Wayne Gretzky . In 1982 , the Habs again made the playoffs and again exited early . This was also the case in 1983 , 1984 and 1985 before the Habs made the Stanley Cup Finals in 1986 . They beat the Calgary Flames in 5 games to claim their 23rd Stanley Cup setting a professional team sports record for most championships won .
The idea that a team that makes the playoffs five years in a row is considered bad is laughable compared to today 's rendition of the Canadiens franchise . I would laugh but I 'm too busy crying .
2nd Half Schedule Undid Redskins

James Hawkins of The Detroit News breaks down Sunday 's Lions-Panthers game at Ford Field ( 1 p.m. FOX/760 WJR ) .
PANTHERS TO WATCH
Luke Kuechly , LB : Concussions have robbed him of playing time the past two seasons but he 's still one of the league 's most complete defenders . Kuechly can read an offense like few others and seemingly is always in position to make a play . He 's tied for ninth in the league with 34 tackles to go along with three passes defensed , a fumble recovery and an interception .
Kawann Short , DT : His numbers through four games do n't stand out , however , they understate his real value and impact on Carolina 's defense . Short has been the team 's most dominant interior force the past two seasons and this year is no different . He makes life difficult for opposing offenses with his ability to clog running lanes and consistently collapse the pocket .
Christian McCaffrey , RB : The do-it-all rookie is just as much a slot receiver as he is a running back . McCaffrey leads the team with 22 receptions and ranks fourth in the league in receiving yards by a running back with 206 . He 's averaging 73.8 total yards of offense ( 51.5 receiving , 22.3 rushing ) per game and is also deployed as a punt and kickoff returner .
INTANGIBLES
■ Contain Cam : Panthers quarterback Cam Newton appears to be shaking off the rust after missing most of the preseason with a shoulder injury , which coach Ron Rivera said contributed to his early struggles . While he 's averaging a career-low 5.5 rush attempts , Newton ( 6-foot-6 , 260 pounds ) is still a load to bring down and a threat to rip off a long run off a read option .
■ Trench war : Another game , another imposing front seven . After being overrun and allowing six sacks against the Vikings last week , the Lions ' offensive linemen must do a better job winning their one-on-one battles to protect Matthew Stafford and allow passing plays to develop downfield . If not , it 'll hamstring the passing attack and could lead to an ugly offensive showing against Carolina 's fourth-ranked defense .
■ Battle of strengths : It 's no secret that the Panthers will pound the rock with bruiser Jonathan Stewart ( 5-10 , 240 ) and shifty Christian McCaffrey leading their 13th-ranked rushing attack ( 116.2 yards ) , which is averaging 29.2 attempts per game . The Lions have stood tall against the run , ranking seventh in the league ( 86.3 yards ) , and will receive a boost with middle linebacker Jarrad Davis slated to return .
■ Limit deep shots : So far , the Lions ' secondary has only allowed three completions on 19 passing attempts that have traveled at least 20 yards . If the Lions are forced to stack the box and are n't putting pressure on Newton , it could open up plenty of downfield chances for big-bodied receivers Kelvin Benjamin ( 6-5 , 245 ) and Devin Funchess ( 6-4 , 225 ) .
FACTS AND FIGURES
■ The Lions are tied for the league lead in total takeaways ( 11 ) and points off turnovers ( 47 ) .
■ Jim Caldwell is the fastest Lions coach to reach 30 career wins since Buddy Parker ( 1951-54 ) . Caldwell reached the mark in 52 games and Parker in 41 games .
■ Cam Newton is the first quarterback in NFL history to reach 50 career rushing touchdowns .
■ Through four games , the Panthers are the least penalized team in the league with 13 penalties for 118 yards .
■ Carolina 's offense leads the league in drives over six minutes with seven and third-down efficiency at 51.9 percent ( 27-for-52 ) .
■ The Lions rank first in turnover differential at plus-nine ( 11 takeaways , two giveaways ) and the Panthers are tied for 29th at minus-five ( two takeaways , seven giveaways ) .
■ After throwing a pick-six on his first pass attempt of the season , Matthew Stafford has n't thrown an interception in his last 137 attempts .

Konta broke Buyukakcay in her opening service game and then again in her third to go 4-1 up .
Although the Turk broke back to make it 4-2 , Konta immediately returned the favour for a 5-2 lead , and she was never troubled again .
Konta looked in ruthless mood throughout the second set , and Buyukakcay finished the match having saved only two of the eight break points against her .
Konta will now face American Vania King in the second round .

Dr. Who fans might recognize a familiar structure while walking on Water Street in Chatham .
Formerly a garden shed , the blue TARDIS - or 'time and relative dimension in space ' - police call box sits on Peter Barlow 's property . It 's now decked out with Christmas lights .
“ I wanted something different , ” the retired cabinetmaker said on Saturday , noting it was a project he thought about for years .
The TARDIS is an iconic image for viewers of the British science fiction series , which first aired in 1963 . Numerous actors have played Dr. Who over the decades .
Barlow , who founded Leeds Cabinets , began the TARDIS a month ago , working on the full-sized replica of the time-space vehicle for about 100 hours .
“ There are different variations of it , ” he said , admitting he 's not a hardcore fan of the show but does enjoy watching it .
The shed was disassembled , sprayed and put back together .
His friend and neighbour Jim Brodie assisted with the roof of the structure .
Barlow said there has been some curiosity among passersby and expects to decorate the call box depending on the season .
“ We 're going to put some Halloween stuff on it when it 's time , ” he said .

LONDON ( Reuters ) - Britain is aiming to secure a comprehensive free trade deal with the European Union and wants it to be signed shortly after it leaves the bloc in 2019 , Brexit minister David Davis said on Sunday .

After securing an initial agreement on Friday to move Brexit talks to a second phase , Prime Minister Theresa May is keen to start discussing future ties with the EU , and especially the type of trading agreement to try to offer greater certainty for businesses .
But despite Davis striking a confident tone , EU officials say they will only launch negotiations on a legally binding treaty after Britain leaves and becomes a “ third country ” , according to draft negotiating guidelines .
“ It 's not that complicated , it comes right back to the alignment point ... We start in full alignment , we start in complete convergence so we can work it out from there , ” Davis told the BBC 's Andrew Marr show .
“ The thing is how we manage divergence so it does n't undercut the access to the market , ” he said , describing his preferred deal as “ Canada plus plus plus ” .
The EU has been considering a post-Brexit free trade deal with Britain along the lines of one agreed last year with Canada .
But the UK economy is nearly twice the size of Canada 's and British officials have said that their current alignment with EU standards and much closer trading links with the continent give them scope for an even deeper relationship .
LIMITED RESPITE
May has been hailed by many in her deeply divided Conservative party for rescuing the agreement to unlock the Brexit talks by offering EU member Ireland and her allies in Northern Ireland a pledge to avoid any return of a hard border .
By playing with the wording , May agreed that if the two sides failed to agree an overall Brexit deal , the United Kingdom would keep “ full alignment ” with those rules of the EU 's single market that help cooperation between Ireland 's north and south .
Davis described the commitment as more of a “ statement of intent ” than a legally binding measure -- something that might reassure hardline Brexit campaigners who fear that it could imply that Britain was leaving the EU in name only .
Despite last week 's progress , May will enjoy little respite . The second phase of talks is expected to expose the rifts in her top team of ministers over what Britain should look like once it leaves the EU .
On Saturday , environment minister Michael Gove , a Brexit campaigner , opened up the possibility of changing the terms of any agreement with the EU after Brexit if Britons felt that the deal had not reflected their demands to “ take back control ” .
“ If the British people dislike the arrangement that we have negotiated with the EU , the agreement will allow a future government to diverge , ” Gove wrote in a column in the Daily Telegraph .

Over the next five years the County will need to dip less into its rainy day fund and will have a balanced budget by 2022 . Thats according to L. Brooks Patterson , Oakland Countys executive as outlined in his five-year budget plan distributed to the countys leadership .
A growing tax base means the county will collect more money and wont rely as much on other county resources to balance the budget .
Property values are rising and the taxes collected are rising as a result . Thats true even as expenses , such as those in the Circuit Court and Economic Development/Community Affairs , increase . The difference between the two means the county doesnt need to rely on the General Fund Balance to make ends meet .

The Pattersons plan serves as the foundation of the countys budget for fiscal years 2018 through 2020 , which will be presented to the Board of Commissioners by July 1 .
The Long-Range Fiscal Plan Summary report identifies and discusses potential financial issues facing the county and proposes means to resolve those issues ,  said Patterson in an email to county officials April 10 . Our challenge is not yet over .
Given our proven track record as a team of committed leaders and our focus on long-range proactive planning , I am confident that together we will achieve structural balance within the next few years ,  he said .
In 2018 , according to Patterson , the county will need $ 28.5 million from the General Fund Balance . That shrinks to $ 18.6 million in 2020 , the end of three-year budget cycle . Currently , there is roughly $ 204 million in the countys rainy day fund . That shrinks to $ 118 million in 2020 .
Patterson has proposed budget increases of two to three percent a year from 2018 to 2020 .

2022 - $ 464.7 million
Patterson said that , overall , there is a decreasing reliance on planned use of available General Fund balance for ongoing operations .
Use of fund balance should be considered to be a one-time resource that once spent is no longer available and is only replenished when there is an annual operating surplus ,  he said . It is projected that fund balance will be available to fund some limited one-time projects , primarily capital in nature.
The county determined its five-year plan using :
 2016 fiscal year financials records ;
 2017 fiscal year first quarter forecasts ;
 2016 fiscal year property valuations ;
 2018 fiscal year state budget recommendations ;
 Recent economic reports ;

Daniil Kvyat insists Toro Rosso does not need to make any changes to its approach in order to improve its form in the second half of the 2017 Formula One season .
The Faenza-based outfit occupies sixth in the constructors ' standings , having scored 39 points in the first 11 races of the year . Toro Rosso is currently on course to beat its tally from 2016 and improve on its championship position , despite only registering two top ten finishes in the last five races .
Kvyat believes Toro Rosso 's biggest weakness so far this season has been in finding the strongest set-up on both its cars . Kvyat was particularly puzzled during qualifying in Spain , as he ended up 20th and last , while teammate Carlos Sainz made Q2 and claimed 12th . The Russian reckons getting clean weekends between now and the end of 2017 would solve such issues .
`` No changes are necessary as the only thing we really need is a clean weekend , without any issues , '' Kvyat explained . `` If all the pieces of the puzzle are in place , it 's quite simple in fact . I 'd put it like that : it 's much easier than it may seem to someone , who 's not involved . Everything works well , so yeah , no need for significant changes . Our pace is good , and results would be good as well .

`` Talking about my side of the garage , I believe we show some good pace in qualifying . Especially during the weekends , when we managed to get the car into the optimal performance window . Setting up the car is a real challenge this year because of the very sensitive aero , which is now a major component .
`` That is something we fail to do properly on some occasions , and it may lead to dramatic consequences . But in general , whenever we have a clean session , the pace is high on both Saturdays and Sundays . And this is something that makes us feel optimistic . Again , we just need to try and have a clean weekend , and the rest will be there . ''
Kvyat has come under-fire for a number of misdemeanours , as well as for causing two opening-lap incidents in the first half of the campaign , though it looks likely he will remain on the grid in 2018 . The Toro Rosso driver got tangled up with McLaren 's Fernando Alonso at the first corner in Austria , before crashing into Sainz at Silverstone . Kvyat , who has failed to finish in the top ten since his home race in Russia and has scored just four points compared to Sainz 's 35 , feels his results will improve if he remains patient .
`` The season opening was quite promising , '' he said . `` I believe that in general , we had many promising weekends , but we just did n't manage to get the maximal outcome . It was either technical issues , or I got in trouble during the first lap , which happened twice , what prevented us from scoring more points . Many times we had minor issues here and there which damaged us big time .
`` But in situations like that , you just need to be patient . Sooner or later , the result will come : we have all the necessary ingredients . So , we just need to continue doing our work , trying to have cleaner Saturdays and Sundays and the reward will be there . Everything is under control , and you need to be pleased with your job , enjoy doing it . That 's the recipe . ''
CLAIM
Before his death , physicist Stephen Hawking declared his Christian faith after a visit with Pope Francis .
False
RATING
False
ORIGIN
The renowned physicist Stephen Hawking died in March 2018 at the age of 76 , prompting a wave of tributes from the world of science , as well as reflections on his inspirational life story .
On 14 March 2018 , the “ Catholics Online ” Facebook page posted a photograph of Hawking meeting Pope Francis alongside a fabricated claim :
Before he died , Stiph [ sic ] Hawkins [ sic ] who did not believe in God requested to visit the Vatican . “ Now l believe ” was the only statement he made after the Holy Father blessed him .
Hawking was a longstanding and prominent atheist who often wrote and spoke about the origins of the universe and his views on the notion of a divine Creator ( or rather , a lack thereof ) . As the Washington Post documented after his death , Hawking told the Guardian in 2011 that he did not believe in an afterlife or heaven :
I regard the brain as a computer which will stop working when its components fail . There is no heaven or afterlife for broken down computers ; that is a fairy story for people afraid of the dark .
In 2010 , he told ABC News : “ One ca n't prove that God does n't exist , but science makes God unnecessary . ”
There is no evidence that Hawking deviated from those lifelong views before his death , and he did not make any declaration of faith after a meeting with Pope Francis.The photograph in the Facebook post shows Hawking and Francis together at the Vatican in November 2016 , the last time the two men met . Contrary to the claim , Hawking did not request a private visit with the pontiff ; rather , he travelled to Rome for a scheduled meeting of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences .
Hawking was a valued member of the academy , having been appointed to it by Pope Paul VI in 1968 . The Pontifical Academy of Sciences listed has among its aims “ fostering interaction between faith and reason and encouraging dialogue between science and spiritual , cultural , philosophical and religious values. ” After his death , the academy honored Hawking , tweeting a series of photographs of the physicist meeting Popes Paul VI , John Paul II , Benedict XVI , and Francis .

However , notwithstanding his decades-long commitment to fostering dialogue between science and faith , Hawking remained an unbeliever himself .
Hawking 's phony deathbed conversion is one in a long series of similar hoaxes of opportunity . For example , after the 2011 death of the writer Christopher Hitchens — an outspoken atheist and critic of organized religion — American evangelical Christian writer Larry Alex Taunton published a controversial book in which he claimed Hitchens had reevaluated his religious faith while he was dying of esophageal cancer . The book was widely dismissed and fiercely criticized by friends of Hitchens . Before that , there were debunked eleventh-hour “ conversions ” to Christianity by Charles Darwin , the father of the theory of evolution , and astronomer Carl Sagan .
This Facebook post is just another in a litany of fabricated claims about famous non-believers . The source is a Facebook page associated with the disreputable web site FrancisMary.org , which appears to have no formal affiliation with the Catholic church and routinely posts clickbait articles touting videos of Jesus Christ appearing in the flesh during a church service , or as an “ angel on a white horse fighting in Israel . ”
DAYTON — Legendary aerobatic pilot Sean D. Tucker will make his final solo appearance at the 2018 Vectren Dayton Air Show .
Tucker is retiring from solo performances at the end of the 2018 air show season and his famous red biplane , the Oracle Challenger III , will be retired to the Smithsonian Air and Space Museum for display .
Tucker plans to form an aerobatic team for future performances which is less physically demanding than performing solo .
The 44th annual air show will be held June 23-24 in the skies over Vandalia and feature the U.S. Navy Blue Angels .
The addition of Tucker to the show was announced with the addition of the Jack Link 's Beef Jerky “ Screamin Sasquatch ” Jet Waco . The plane is a highly modified 1929 Taperwing Waco with a conventional engine . However , the plane also has a jet engine underneath that allows the plane to fly vertically using a combined 4,500 pounds of thrust .
“ Sean and the Jet Waco are two incredible additions to the 2018 show , ” stated Scott Buchanan , Chairman of the United States Air & Trade Show Board of Trustees , the governing body of the show . “ Sean 's last solo performance is a must-see and the remarkable Jet Waco is a thrill to watch . Add the Blue Angels , the F-22 Raptor and others , and you have a world-class show . ”
Tickets for this summer 's show are available at www.daytonairshow.com or can be bought beginning May 14 at area Kroger stores .

Beds Senior Trophy , second round : Totternhoe 4 Queens Park 0
Totternhoe cruised into the second round of the Bedfordshire Senior Trophy after a comfortable 4-0 win against Bedfordshire Premier Division side Queens Park Crescents .
The hosts started the game well and raced into a 2-0 lead after early on as firstly Andy Cleere finished well on two minutes , before Daniel Dyer headed home a Ash Farmer corner on the 10 minute mark .
The Totts then took their foot off the gas and the game became very scrappy , as it was n't netted the third .
Chris Golding wrapped up the scoring five minutes from time when he finished a Farmer cross at the back post to earn a second round tie with SSML Division One side Bedford Saturday , November 4 .
Speaking afterwards , Totts boss Chris Robson said : “ It was important to get a win today after three games without one .
“ We started very well and completely blew them away in the first 10 minutes , however I was slightly disappointed after that as we became very complacent and started to overcomplicate things with our play .
“ Up until the last 10 minutes the game became very untidy , boring , and stopstart with a lot of fouls , but we came back to life with 10 minutes to go and wrapped up the game .
“ I am very pleased with the win as we needed it after a tough couple of weeks , and although the performance was n't vintage , in cup football the only thing that matters is that you are in the hat for the next round . ”
Totternhoe host Park View in the league this weekend .
Meanwhile , boss Robson has been named the SSML Rep Side Manager for their upcoming FA Inter League National Cup campaign .
The FA Inter-League Cup is a national competition run by The Football Association . The winning team goes on to represent England & the English FA in the UEFA Regions Cup , a European competition .

Live music , food and arts will be featured all day during the 42nd annual Locust Street Festival this June 10 in Riverwest . Vendors and stages will line the street between Holton and Humboldt , with 35 different bands playing throughout the event . The main attraction is the annual Beer Run , a 1.8-mile walk or run through the Riverwest neighborhood .
Names like Keith Pulvermacher , Sigmund Snowpek 's Beer Show and Chicken Wire Empire will be jamming out on the festival 's stages . The air will be filled with the sounds of different country , rock and Latin bands as they rotate through the fest 's six different stages from 11 a.m. to 8 p.m .
Most of the stages are based out of local Riverwest businesses , like Klinger 's East and Linneman 's Riverwest Inn .
On top of the large variety of music , there will be an astounding number of vendors lining Locust street for the festival . Most of these vendors specialize in food , art and crafts . Sixty of these vendors have attended for the past 13 years , specializing in lotion and soap .
“ People like to come here for the Riverwest vibe , ” said Linda Maslow , organizer of the festival for the last 13 years . “ If we did no advertising for the event , people would come anyway . ”
This year 's Beer Run will be set off at 11:30 a.m. by Alderman Nik Kovac with the help of the Tripoli Shriners , who the festival has partnered up with for the first time this year . The race lasts for an hour , starting at Locust street and passing through Weil , Center , Fratney and Chambers before finally ending at Locust again .
Participants must be 21 or older to register .
Registration can be done online at $ 23 or in person for $ 25 during the day of the event before 11 a.m .
Proceeds from the run go to the Tripoli Shrine Center .
“ I am looking forward to meeting new and old vendors alike , ” said Maslow . “ I am also excited about some of the bands that are playing and mingling with our Riverwest neighbors . ”
Gabe DeVoe scored 24 points and No . 20 Clemson beat Wake Forest 75-67 on Saturday .
Marcquise Reed added 10 of his 22 in the final six minutes to help the Tigers ( 19-4 , 8-3 Atlantic Coast Conference ) win their third straight and claim sole possession of second place in the league standings , a half-game ahead of No . 4 Duke .
Bryant Crawford scored 16 points and Keyshawn Woods added 13 for the Demon Deacons ( 9-14 , 2-9 ) . Wake Forest went 5 minutes without a field goal down the stretch while Clemson finally took control of a tight game that had 20 lead changes and 12 ties .
Reed put the Tigers ahead to stay with a free throw with 3:39 to play , and his jumper with about 90 seconds left put Clemson up 69-65 - the first time since early in the second half that the margin was greater than two possessions either way .
Doral Moore added 13 rebounds for the Demon Deacons . Shelton Mitchell finished with 10 points for the Tigers .
BIG PICTURE
Clemson : The Tigers did enough to sidestep a letdown that could have come following their victory over No . 19 North Carolina five nights earlier . The result was a leg up on the rest of the conference in the race for second in the ACC behind No . 2 Virginia , which has a three-game lead on everyone else .
Wake Forest : This one will go on the lengthy list of ones that got away for the Demon Deacons - who also struggled down the stretch in losses to Tennessee , North Carolina and N.C. State . They missed nine of their final 10 shots in this one .

NEW YORK ( AP )  Stock markets around the world downshifted into neutral on Tuesday , and U.S. indexes were close to flat in early trading . Bond yields were also steady , while the price of oil rose .

YELLEN WATCH : Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen will testify before a Senate committee on Tuesday , and investors are hoping for clues on the direction of interest rates . The central bank raised rates in December for just the second time in a decade . Most investors expect more increases in 2017 , but only at a modest pace .
The economy continues to strengthen , which gives the central bank more leeway to raise rates .
INFLATION GAUGE : Inflation has been low across the world for years , but a sharp pickup could force the Federal Reserve into raising rates even more quickly . A government report on Tuesday showed that inflation at the wholesale level was 1.6 percent in January , compared with prices a year earlier . That was in line with economists ' expectations , who say overall inflation appears to still be in check .
BOND YIELDS : The yield on the 10-year Treasury note held steady at 2.43 percent , while the 30-year Treasury yield ticked higher to 3.04 percent from 3.03 percent late Monday .
GLOBAL MARKETS : Stocks were relatively steady across the world . In Europe , the German DAX index dipped 0.1 percent , while the French CAC 40 and British FTSE 100 each edged up by 0.1 percent . In Asia , the Hang Seng index in Hong Kong was close to flat , while the South Korean Kospi index dipped 0.2 percent and the Japanese Nikkei 225 index fell 1.1 percent .
COMMODITY REBOUND : Benchmark U.S. crude oil rose 64 cents to $ 53.56 per barrel . A day earlier , it had lost 93 cents . Brent crude , the international standard , rose 75 cents to $ 56.33 per barrel .
Natural gas fell a penny to $ 2.93 per 1,000 cubic feet .
Gold rose $ 8.20 to $ 1,234.00 per ounce , silver added 16 cents to $ 17.98 per ounce and copper slipped a penny to $ 2.77 per pound .
CURRENCIES : The dollar held steady at 113.62 Japanese yen . The euro rose to $ 1.0616 from $ 1.0600 late Monday , and the British pound dipped to $ 1.2471 from $ 1.2529 .

LOS ANGELES-Lady GaGa is expanding her charity organisation to help orphaned children and teenage mothers .
The ‘ Poker Face ' hitmaker - who has tried to promote human rights and social issues for years - has reportedly filed legal documents to trademark ‘ Channel Kindness ' through her non-for-profit Born This Way Foundation so that she can expand her charitable services and cultural awareness .
According to the documents , obtained by The Blast , Channel Kindness will provide food and furniture to needy persons , child care services for the children of teenage mothers , temporary housing accommodations for teenage mother and their children , and food to destitute children .
The project will also provide meals to qualified recipients after they are discharged from the hospital , give monetary grants to individuals and local community groups who provide acts of kindness , services and activities for persons in need and help arrange fundraising events to encourage intercollegiate athletic programmes as well as many other things . The 32-year-old singer launched Channel Kindness in 2016 as a media platform that saw youth reporters cover acts of kindness in their communities . The Born This Way Foundation was set up in 2011 , and aims to help young people build a ‘ 'kinder and braver world '' for the future .
A description of the charity on its website reads : ‘ 'Born This Way Foundation is committed to supporting the wellness of young people and empowering them to build a kinder and braver world . Focusing on fostering kindness and mental wellness , the foundation leverages innovative programming , quality research , and authentic partnerships in order to : demonstrate the potential of kindness to transform lives and communities , validate the emotions of young people , and eradicate the stigma around mental health . ''
In 2016 , Gaga herself revealed she suffered from PTSD after allegedly being raped at the age of 19 by a man who was 20 years older than her .
After visiting youth centre in November 2016 , she said : ‘ ' I told the kids today that I suffer from a mental illness . I suffer from PTSD . I 've never told anyone that before , so here we are . But the kindness that 's shown to me by doctors as well as my family , and my friends , it 's really saved my life . I have a mental illness , and I struggle with that mental illness every day . ''
The Culture Guard group has helped Hells Angels in the past , said its executive director .
Members of the Soldiers of Odin group attended the anti-SOGI rally . ( Black Press files )
The organizer of an anti-SOGI123 rally in Vancouver Monday said she invited members of the Hells Angels to attend .
“ We invited the Hells Angels , we invited anybody who has children and who has a stake in education that is opposed to SOGI is welcome to stand with us , ” said Kari Simpson of the Culture Guard group .
She said some accepted the invitation and attended .
“ They 're also fathers , and mothers , and they do n't often get involved in these things , ” said Simpson , who is based in Langley . “ We 've had their support in the past when we 've helped their members with child apprehensions years ago . ”
“ Parents are parents and everybody has a stake in education , ” Simpson said .
“ They give really good protection , unlike the VPD [ Vancouver Police Department ] , ” she added .
The VPD was not aware of any Hells Angels attending the event , said Const . Jason Doucette , a media spokesperson for the department .
A pro-SOGI protester from Langley said she and her fellow rally members did n't spot anyone wearing Hells Angels colours or clothing at the rally .
“ I find that really alarming , ” said Stacey Wakelin , a parent who has been among the organizers of local pro-SOGI events .
She said the presence of Hells Angels members wo n't stop her from attending future rallies .
“ I 'm past the point of being afraid , ” Wakelin said .
However , she worried what effect it could have on others , particularly vulnerable people in the LGBTQ community .
SOGI stands for sexual orientation and gender identity .
SOGI 123 was introduced as a pilot project last year and was rolled out B.C.-wide in September . According to the program 's website , it provides tools for teachers to create inclusive classrooms where students of all sexual orientations and gender identities feel safe .
The program has generated controversy , and pro- and anti-SOGI rallies have been held in Langley and other Lower Mainland communities .
Rallies were held Monday in Vancouver and Victoria , with each side represented .

“ It was truly diverse , unlike the other side , ” Simpson said , citing the participation of Sikh and Muslim anti-SOGI protesters .
Also among those taking part were the controversial Soldiers of Odin . The group is an offshoot of an anti-immigrant group in Europe . The Canadian offshoots say they do not share an ideology with the European groups , and accept people of all origins .
However , they have clashed with anti-racism demonstrators locally , with three Soldiers of Odin arrested by the VPD in March of 2017 following a scuffle with marchers organized by the Pacific Coalition Against Bigotry .
Simpson dismissed concerns about the group .
“ I think those are probably overplayed , like us being called a hate group , ” she said .

The PSNI 's latest agricultural and rural crime statistics show a 11 % fall in the number of crimes recorded in rural communities .
However the Ulster Farmers ' Union have been cautious in their response claiming the figures may not ‘ paint the full picture ' believing that some crimes in rural areas go unreported .
PSNI Supt . Brian Kee said that while they take the position that one crime against the rural community is one too many , it is encouraging to note that , according to the latest quarterly update , there has been a 11 % reduction in agri crime in 2017 compared with 2016 and a 47 % reduction since 2010/11 .
He added : “ Statistics only tell part of the story . They do not account for the severe impact theft can have on a farming business , family and community . There is no acceptable level of crime in the rural community or indeed elsewhere . And for PSNI , one victim is one too many .
“ We know from our work with victims of crime that every incident has an impact on individuals , families and the community as a whole . Police remain committed to keeping people safe and we will work hard with the community and partner agencies into the future , including the Rural Crime Partnership , PCSPs , An Gardaí Siochana and a number of other agencies . We remain committed to working with the farming community to drive this figure down even further .
“ We are not complacent , we continue to seek ways in which to disrupt and detect criminals who target rural communities . For instance , we are concerned at an apparent increase in the theft of quads in the first few weeks of 2018 . We would ask members of the public to report anything suspicious to police as soon as possible , ” he added .
“ We understand thefts such as these can have a detrimental effect on a farming business . Spending a bit of time reviewing your security will go a long way to helping reduce your chance of becoming a victim of crime . We also want to work with you to prevent thefts , and offer free advice from your local crime prevention officer . Ring 101 for more information .
“ If possible please keep quads etc . out of sight and kept in a secure shed and apply locks and chains to ensure they are secure . Always remove the keys . GPS systems can also be fitted to quads .
“ We would ask that if you notice something which does not look right , are aware of machinery or equipment being moved at odd times phone police on the 101 number as soon as possible . ”
In its response to the latest figures , the Ulster Farmers ' Union said they were ‘ encouraging ' but urged the PSNI not to become complacent .
UFU legislation committee chairman James O'Brien said : “ Rural crime is often underreported so while the PSNI 's figures are encouraging , they may not paint the full picture of what is actually happening on the ground . I would urge the PSNI not to become complacent and to make rural crime and rural communities a priority .
“ Rural crime is unacceptable in any capacity and the impacts are devastating for any farmer and rural family . Victims are often left feeling vulnerable and demoralised and there is also the financial cost to consider as well .
“ I would encourage farmers to remain vigilant and to review the security arrangements on their farms . The UFU will continue to work with farmers and the PSNI to ensure that rural crime continues to be addressed as a matter of urgency . ”
The Union also issued details of a number of simple things farmers can do to protect their livestock , machinery and equipment .
These include reporting all incidences of theft and any suspicious behaviour to the PSNI ; ensuring premises are well lit ; and gates and doors are securely locked . UFU members can avail of discounts on a number of security products such as Tracker ; Data Tag ; Block Stem and Guard Cam , which can help protect property , livestock , equipment and machinery from thieves .

Robert Skidmore was born in Flint , raised a family there and lived his entire life in and around the blue collar town that -- next to Detroit -- was synonymous with manufacturing of cars and trucks .
But his December 2015 death has been blamed on Legionnaires ' disease and linked to a tainted water crisis that on Wednesday led to involuntary manslaughter and other charges against five officials , including the director of Michigan 's Health and Human Services department .
The 85-year-old Skidmore was one of 12 people to die from the disease and nearly 100 cases of people being sickened from it .
Wednesday 's charges are part of the criminal investigation into how Flint 's water system became poisoned after officials tapped the Flint River in 2014 .
The 48-year-old Nick Lyon is accused of failing to alert the majority-black population about an outbreak of Legionnaires ' disease in the Flint area , which has been linked by some experts to poor water quality in 2014-15 .

It is 2017 , and shortly the White House will be inhabited by an unscrupulous , corrupt narcissist who has shamelessly mobilized the Neo-Nazi fringe of the Republican Party to get into power .
Despite all the cries of ‘ no ' to normalization on the left , Trump will be normalized by the same corporate media that virtually boycotted Bernie Sanders . He will be respectfully called “ the president ” and his wishes and goals will be praised on cable news , and not just on Rupert Murdoch 's Fox Fake News . He 'll flash a smile and be friendly and anchors will treat him like a buddy ( despite his having threatened their colleagues with bodily harm at his rallies and despite his having pledged to weaken the first amendment and sue reporters for libel ) . Rupert Murdoch 's Wall Street Journal is already pledging never to call Trump out when he is obviously lying . Since Trump is , like Dick Nixon , a pathological liar , this is like pledging not to cover his presidency .
A THOUSAND OAKS , Calif. — Sean McVay will often take a few minutes to collect his thoughts before the Los Angeles Rams ' next offensive possession , the first-year head coach sitting on the sideline and sequestering himself to prepare to call plays for the top scoring offence in the NFL and second-best in yards per play .
The television cameras have taken notice of McVay 's ritual , making those moments the image of the Rams ' sudden turnaround from a coaching standpoint . However , offensive co-ordinator Matt LaFleur plays an equally important and overlooked role in the offence 's success by making sure everything is ready for McVay on Sundays , especially communication .
`` So thankful to have him here , '' McVay said Friday . `` He 's as responsible as anybody for the success our offence has had . In terms of organizing the game plans , being able to run the meetings , making sure that everything is in alignment on the same page , he does it all . Ca n't say enough about the contribution he has made to our team . ''
LaFleur joined the Rams after serving as quarterbacks coach for the Atlanta Falcons the past two seasons , a position he has also held at Notre Dame in 2014 and in Washington from 2010-13 . McVay and LaFleur first worked together during those three seasons , developing a common understanding of offensive systems and philosophies that made LaFleur a natural choice to serve as McVay 's top lieutenant on that side of the ball .
It is that shared language that allows LaFleur to convey McVay 's ideas even if the head coach is n't in the room , backup quarterback Sean Mannion said . When they are together with quarterbacks coach Greg Olson , the offence truly flourishes .
`` They are good at communicating in a way that it makes sense to everybody in the room . Just the fact they all have sat in our shoes at one point or another kind of helps them understand how best to communicate what they are thinking on a play to us cause , really , sometimes all it is is saying it a certain way and it hits our brain right , '' said Mannion , snapping his fingers to emphasize the last few words .
As a former college quarterback at Saginaw Valley State who reached the Division II playoffs in three straight seasons , it makes sense that LaFleur can easily explain concepts and provide explanations to young quarterbacks Jared Goff , Mannion and Brandon Allen . Although it was n't in the NFL , LaFleur has practical game experience with whatever situations can happen on the field . That makes him a powerful voice in the room , Mannion said .
`` I think that 's great to be a quarterback with that type of coaching , where they really understand the way we see the game ands also have the ability to see it as the big picture for the whole offence , '' Mannion said . `` It 's huge . ''
Game day is when the conversations between LaFleur , McVay and the quarterbacks are the most urgent . Mannion is always listening in as McVay shares the play with Goff in the huddle , benefitting from what LaFleur sees up in the press box to inform his calls , and hears an extremely smooth relaying of information .
`` One thing that 's important to know about that it is worked on throughout the whole week , '' Mannion said . `` It 's not just a product of doing it well that one day . ''

LONDON ( Reuters ) - It will be the end of an era for athletics on Saturday when Usain Bolt races for the last time in the men 's 4x100 metres relay at the World Championships .
The Jamaican is hoping to step away from the track having won his 20th global championship title , something he was denied last week when he finished third in the 100m behind American Justin Gatlin .
Fans flocking to the London Stadium on Saturday will probably be treated to a double dose of the 30-year-old sprint legend as Bolt plans to take part in the relay heats in the day 's first session .
There will be a fair amount of emotion from the stands as Mo Farah also runs in his last track race - the 5,000 metres final .
The Briton is aiming to complete an unprecedented World Championship triple-double , having retained his 10,000m title on the first day - the home nation 's only medal .
The penultimate day of the championships also has former 100 metres hurdles champion Sally Pearson of Australia going up against world record holder Kendra Harrison of the U.S. for the title .
The decathlon reaches its climax with the traditional 1,500m to close the multi-discipline event .
There are also gold medals to be won in the women 's high jump and the men 's javelin .
In 2015 , NASA 's satellite data revealed that 21 of the world 's 37 large aquifers are severely water-stressed . With growing populations , and increased demands from agriculture and industry , researchers indicated that this crisis is only likely to worsen .
Rajendra Singh , known as the “ water man of India , ” believes that critically depleted aquifers around the world can be revived with community effort . For the past 32 years , through his NGO Tarun Bharat Sangh ( Young India Organization ) , Singh has led community-based water harvesting and water management initiatives in the Alwar district of Rajasthan , an arid , semi-desert state in the northwest of India . For his work , Singh was awarded the Ramon Magsaysay Award for community leadership in 2001 , and the Stockholm Water Prize in 2015 .
The following interview with Singh has been edited for clarity :
You 've often criticized states for taking a top-down , infrastructure-led approach to water management . Are governments generally supportive of alternative community-led initiatives ? Is political and corporate support necessary ?
RS : Governments usually do n't support community initiatives—they support contractors , not communities . The government always likes big projects in the name of combating desertification or rejuvenating the landscape : big dams , big canals , centralized irrigation water systems , pipeline drinking water systems . They create new canals even when the old canals are dry . There is no community participation in these projects . Every type of work is given to a contractor now . It is a contractor-driven democracy , not a people-driven democracy .
Last year , you launched the World Water Peace Walks . What is the role of water in fostering world peace ?
RS : The third world war is at our gate , and it will be about water , if we do n't do something about this crisis . These walks are to raise awareness—this year we covered 17 countries , and in nine of them there were displaced people . Where terrorism is active , there is usually a scarcity of water . So many people in the Middle East and African countries are moving to places like Europe , in part because of water scarcity—after forced migration comes , tension , conflict , and terrorism . Where terrorism is active , there is usually a scarcity of water . Look at Syria—a long time ago , it had very good agriculture , but then Turkey built a dam that changed things . It 's a similar story with Libya . If we want a safe future , we need to start conserving water .
California 's Water Wars After 5 years of drought , California has finally had a deluge of rain . But with much of the state 's water supply being sent to LA , people in drought-affected areas feel they 've been left high and dry .
What role can regulation play in conservation ? Do you think privatizing water is a good way to promote its efficient use ?
RS : If we really think about legal changes , we have to first think about river rights , or the rights of nature , and only then about water rights for humans . This type of thinking does n't exist today but we need this kind of legal framework that assures that the land of the river is only for the river , that the flow of the river is kept clean , and that the river has greenery on both banks to prevent erosion and silting . Only with all these factors can we ensure that rivers are healthy and only then that we are healthy .
Powerful corporations have created a water market—they pollute our rivers and make us pay money for drinking water . They say that only with a high price for water can we get disciplined use , but this is not right . In my region , for the last 19 years our river parliament has made the rules and regulations that everyone follows , and everyone has enough water . Sustainable community-led water management has existed for thousands of years without anyone putting a price on water . So why do we need it today ? Because the corporate sector is making the rules . Privatization is not the answer , charging more is not the answer .
Is This Campaign Aiming To Control Ugandan Women 's Bodies ?
The Ugandan government released a circular from the Ministry of Public Service that imposed a stricter dress code for male and female public servants . Under these guidelines , men may not wear tight trousers , must wear a jacket and tie and keep their hair short and well-groomed . The dress code for women is much more detailed .
Wishing harm on President-Elect of the United States Donald J. Trump on Twitter is one of the hottest new trends here in 2016-17 .
The latest to get in on the inappropriate action ?
His favorite old nemesis , Rosie O'Donnell !
Less than a week after Charlie Sheen pleaded with God to kill Trump , O'Donnell threw out a ( slightly ) less overt request on her account .
“ DONALD TRUMP IS MENTALLY UNSTABLE . LESS THAN 3 WEEKS TO STOP HIM AMERICA , ” read her tweet that linked to CNN .
No , the cable news network did n't report on people trying to off Trump ; CNN 's story was about Trump booting a biographer off a golf course .
Why Rosie chose that of all Trump stories , we can not say , but trying to apply any logic to Rosie O'Donnell is like trying to explain Trump .
In general . These two deserve each other .
Obviously , some vocal members of the 46 percent of America who elected Trump in a self-proclaimed landslide were n't happy about this :
Rosie 's call for America to “ STOP HIM ” can be perceived as a veiled threat , and one that is sadly no shock given the entertainers ' history .
They 've …read more

Another visual for you . China 's liquidity is now “ growing ” ( actually shrinking ? ) at the lowest level in over 20 years . Please remember this , ALL Ponzi schemes must grow , and GROW exponentially over time to survive . The Chinese are well aware of this and why they have stocked up on real money ( gold ) over these past years . Could it be “ they ” are pulling the plug and will end up with all the marbles ( gold and infrastructure ) ? The Chinese are very smart people and know history as well as anyone , Mao called it correctly on August 15 , 1971 !

June 14 , 2017
The Federal Reserve approved its second rate hike of 2017 even amid expectations that inflation is running well below the central bank 's target .
In addition , the Fed provided more detail on how it will unwind its $ 4.5 trillion balance sheet , or portfolio of bonds that includes Treasurys , mortgage-backed securities and government agency debt .
As financial markets had anticipated , the policymaking Federal Open Market Committee increased its benchmark target a quarter point . The new range will be 1 percent to 1.25 percent for a rate that currently is 0.91 percent .

You Wo n't Believe This Stupid New Law Against Cash And Bitcoin
June 14 , 2017
This one is almost too ridiculous to believe .
Recently a new bill was introduced on the floor of the US Senate entitled , pleasantly ,
“ Combating Money Laundering , Terrorist Financing , and Counterfeiting Act of 2017 . ”
You can probably already guess its contents .
Cash is evil .
Bitcoin is evil .
Now they 've gone so far to include prepaid mobile phones , retail gift vouchers , or even electronic coupons . Evil , evil , and evil .
These people are certifiably insane .

Bundesbank 's Weidmann : Digital Currencies Will Make The Next Crisis Worse
June 14 , 2017
When global financial markets crash , it wo n't be just “ Trump 's fault ” ( and perhaps the quants and HFTs who switch from BTFD to STFR ) to keep the heat away from the Fed and central banks for blowing the biggest asset bubble in history : according to the head of the German central bank , Jens Weidmann , another “ pre-crash ” culprit emerged after he warned that digital currencies such as bitcoin would worsen the next financial crisis .
As the FT reports , speaking in Frankfurt on Wednesday the Bundesbank 's president acknowledged the creation of an official digital currency by a central bank would assure the public that their money was safe . However , he warned that this could come at the expense of private banks ' ability to survive bank runs and financial panics .
As Citigroup 's Hans Lorenzen showed yesterday , as a result of the global liquidity glut , which has pushed conventional assets to all-time highs , a tangent has been a scramble for “ alternatives ” and resulted in the creation and dramatic rise of countless digital currencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum . Citi effectively blamed the central banks for the cryptocoin phenomenon .

Is The Global Gold Price Really Headed To A Jaw-Dropping $ 20,000 – $ 150,000 ?
June 13 , 2017
June 14 ( King World News ) – Despite having been officially outlawed as money decades ago , gold still remains the primary monetary reserve asset of all major central banks . Based on our remarks in this report and the 10 preceding reports , it should be clear that we believe that gold must be regarded as a monetary asset .
We first presented the so-called “ shadow gold price ” calculated by Paul Brodsky and Lee Quaintance in 2011 . This way of looking at the gold price is by no means a mere intellectual game . Rather , it is in line with how the exchange rate between paper money and gold was determined according to the Bretton Woods agreement ( US monetary base divided by US gold reserves ) . As Brodsky and Quaintance explain :
“ The Shadow Gold Price extrapolates forward the Bretton Woods model for valuing US dollars ( USD base money/US official gold holdings ) , used from 1945 to 1973 . Rather than fixing the gold/USD exchange rate ( at 1/35 of an ounce , which assumed a static quantity of base money ) , it uses the actual quantity of base money vs. actual gold holdings .

This is typical Gibbons thinking . He does not have an agent to represent him , relying on serendipitous circumstance to steer his way through MLB life . As a manager in the Mets ' farm system , he was blocked from a promotion to the big-league coaching staff and quit rashly without having another job lined up .
“ Really , it was his first full-blown off-season ( as GM ) and there were some big decisions . I said , we 'll just wait on my thing and if we get a chance this winter to get it done , great . If not we can go down to spring training and hopefully get something done . He wanted to sit down and I said , ‘ Listen , you 've got too much going on . ' ”
“ We had talked about it , and really what it came down to — and I told Ross this — with a lot of free agents it 's going to be a busy off-season , ” Gibbons recalled of his preliminary discussion following the AL championship series loss to the Indians .
As for Gibbons , who is under contract for one more year , he seems quietly confident he will be taken care of by general manager Ross Atkins before opening day .
DUNEDIN , FLA.—Just another Valentine 's Day at Blue Jays training camp , and while manager John Gibbons waited patiently to feel the love from his bosses with a multi-year extension , right-hander Marcus Stroman learned he had won his arbitration case in the form of a one-year , $ 3.4-million deal . The club had been offering $ 3.1 million .
He laughed when chided about the meandering route he has taken to his office at Florida Auto Exchange Stadium — feet up on the desk , smiling , waiting for camp to officially open on Wednesday with a workout for pitchers and catchers .
“ I 'm comfortable where I 'm at , ” Gibbons shrugged . “ Everybody likes the rewards . The rewards of the game are huge , and I would like that , but that 's never been a driving force . I think we 'll get something done . . . but either way . ”
That led to Gibbons the job seeker , with Mets minor-league teammate J.P. Ricciardi offering to help him out . Ricciardi became Jays GM and gave his buddy a bullpen catcher position in 2002 . His knee gave out in the 'pen after one month , though , so Ricciardi suggested a move to first-base coach . Manager Carlos Tosca gave out soon after , leaving Gibbons standing in the middle of the clubhouse at Yankee Stadium as the new manager . On it goes . He has managed twice , applying for neither job .
“ I 've been blessed , ” the 54-year-old Texan admitted . “ I 've been sitting around many times thinking a lot of things have fallen in place for me . That 's why you do n't burn bridges . There 's something to that .
“ When I walked away from the Mets to get a job closer to home , J.P. had n't been named the GM yet . Next thing you know he 's named GM , so he took care of me . Of course he had to fire me ( in 2008 ) , and the bench coaching job in Kansas City opened up with another friend of mine , Trey Hillman . When I got cut loose there , the ( Double-A ) San Antonio job just happened to be open and that 's my hometown . ”
Somehow , Gibbons ranks 103rd in MLB history with 644 career wins . In two separate stints with the Jays he has accumulated nine seasons as a manager and is now one of the veteran skippers . When he started out in 2004 , the Tigers ' Jim Leyland and the Yankees ' Joe Torre were kind to him . He is especially close to Leyland .
Gibbons is one of the last of the pre-analytics managers , and young managers who have followed him do not look to seek his council . He spoke about the most important lessons he has learned since taking over in 2004 .
“ How a big-league game works — it 's different , ” Gibbons said . “ There 's a lot at stake . You 're dealing with veteran superstars and you do n't get that in the minor leagues . They all have different personalities , come from different parts of the world . The game happens fast at the big-league level . It has slowed down for me , no doubt . You 've been through so many different things . Mistakes here and there , so if you make them again it 's not going to destroy you because , hell , you 've done it before . I think overall it 's like any profession . Experience does wonders . ”
Gibbons has spoken with admiration in the past about how the Tampa Bay Rays always construct a solid bullpen using mostly veteran parts , and understand that you have to keep moving forward when it comes to relief . The Jays have never come closer to using that model than this year .
“ It 's tough to gauge what your bullpen 's going to look like because year-to-year you never know , ” Gibbons said . “ Very rarely do you get a certain bullpen and it sticks with you for years . Somebody falters . Somebody gets hurt . There 's constant turnover , but I like the shape of our bullpen . I do n't think anybody 's done it better than Tampa does . With veterans , there are not as many guys out there that you 're guessing on . Veteran guys have all been through it before . ”
As for Stroman , the pitcher refused to enlighten writers regarding his arbitration victory , but the exchange of numbers was so close that it ca n't really be deemed a loss for the Jays .
For those wondering why the Jays did n't just settle at Stroman 's number and keep him happy , the club has had a policy for at least a decade that arbitration-eligible players are expected to reach agreement before the numbers are exchanged , or else the club will follow through with the process all the way . Players know that . The Jays likely did not play dirty in the hearing room last week , held before a panel of three independent arbitrators . They may even have thrown in a box of chocolates .
All signs point to Neil Young finally releasing his long-lost 1976 album Hitchhiker this summer . And now the fan site Thrasher 's Wheat has uncovered more details about the album via a commenter by the name of Shakeyjrc , who shared what appears to be a press release announcing Hitchhiker for 8/4 release and providing its full tracklist . According to the apparent press release , the album largely features new versions of previously released material but contains two unreleased tracks : “ Hawaii , ” described as “ a soaring ballad and unlike anything else Young had recorded at the time , ” and “ Give Me Strength , ” which Young occasionally performed live in the '70s but has never seen studio release . Read the potential PR announcement below .
Neil Young will release a new studio album — which he originally recorded in 1976 . The disc , dubbed Hitchhiker , is set for an August 4 release via Reprise Records and will be available on vinyl , CD and digitally .
The 10-track acoustic album was recorded live in the studio August 11 , 1976 , at Indigo Studios in Malibu , California . It contains some of Young 's best-loved songs plus two previously unreleased tracks .
The original session was produced by Young 's longtime studio collaborator David Brings with new post production by John Hanlon , who has worked with Young since 1990 and produced his most recent works , including Peace Trail , Earth , The Monsanto Years , etc .
As these songs were recorded in a single session , the resultant performances are breathtaking and passionate . The simplicity of a single voice and guitar captured here are as pure and powerful as the creator intended with only Young and Briggs in the room at the time of recording .
Many of the songs would not appear on vinyl until years later . The title track , for example , did not officially appear until 2010 's Le Noise and naturally sounds worlds apart from the original . The version herein of “ Captain Kennedy ” has certain raw spontaneity compared to the slightly gentler version that would eventually surface on Hawks & Doves in 1980 .
Perhaps the most noticeable jewels in the crown of Hitchhiker are the two previously unreleased tracks that have remained in the vaults since 1976 : “ Hawaii ” a soaring ballad and unlike anything else Young had recorded at the time . Side one closes out with “ Give Me Strength , ” which would be occasionally performed live in the mid-Seventies but now available here for the first time and may well be considered one of Young 's best long lost gems .
Hitchhiker Track Listing :
1 . Pocahontas
2 . Powderfinger
3 . Captain Kennedy
4 . Hawaii
5 . Give Me Strength
6 . Ride My Llama
7 . Hitchhiker
8 . Campaigner
9 . Human Highway
10 . The Old Country Waltz
ST. JOHN 'S , N.L . -
It was likely not what police expected to find when they pulled over a Newfoundland driver for a routine traffic violation : a car held together by rope .
Officers say they stopped the car in St. John 's at about 4:30 p.m. Sunday after noticing it was unregistered .
But Const . Geoff Higdon of the Royal Newfoundland Constabulary said that when a tow truck arrived and was lifting the car up on the rack , an officer spotted a strand rope on its underbelly .
He said that when they took a closer look , officers discovered a rear control arm — which links the chassis to the hub that carries the wheel — was tied to the frame with a piece of rope .
Officers say the 40-year-old man driving the car was ticketed for operating an unregistered vehicle .
The car was also seized after police deemed it a “ road safety concern ” for the public .
One passenger was killed and over a dozen others were injured when an interprovincial bus rammed at the rear of a parawood truck on the Friendship Highway known as Mittraphap in Pak Chong district of Nakhon Ratchasima province before dawn Monday .
The bus which belongs to Roong Prasert Tour Co Ltd was on the way from Ubon Ratchathani province to Bangkok , while the truck was from Udon Thani to deliver the parawood to factory in Kaeng Koi district of Saraburi .

After spending three years in Finland with the TPS Turku organization , Russian goalie Alexander Georgiev was signed to an entry-level contract in July by the New York Rangers . In this exclusive interview , Georgiev talks about his move to North America , his prospects in New York and his early career .
The Hockey Writers reached the Russian goalkeeper in Turku where he is practicing for the upcoming season .
“ I just started practicing on ice , earlier it was just off-ice training , ” Georgiev explained in his native Russian . “ I am not sure about the exact date that I will fly to New York . Most likely in late August . ”
He was also open about his plans for the summer : “ Before leaving for New York , I will practice with my personal trainer . Many Finn players from the NHL practice in Turku . But not only , also players from the Finnish Elite League . For example [ Rasmus ] Ristolainen , [ Patrik ] Laine , [ Lauri ] Korpikoski , [ Mikko Rantanen ] . More or less everyone who is willing to pay ( laughs ) . ”
First Steps in Hockey
Georgiev liked to talk about his childhood . “ I was born in Bulgaria , but my parents left almost right away for Russia . When I was five , my parents decided to get me involved in sports , and they chose hockey. ” The goalie recalls very well his first reaction to the sport : “ It was love at first sight ! ”
He started playing hockey for the local team Penguins , the same team that developed Tampa Bay prospect Alexander Volkov . He did n't play goalie at the start though . “ At first , we just skated all together , no one had a true role . Then when we were six or seven years old the coaches asked each kid who wanted to play in goal , and I wanted to give it a try . ”
The goalie then moved to Voskresensk and started playing for the local Khimik junior team , once a strong team that has n't managed to get back to its heydey ( their alumni include Andrei Markov , Vladislav Namestnikov , and Slava Kozlov ) . After playing in kids leagues , Georgiev spent a full season in the MHL without being iced a single time . “ It was very hard for me . The team had two older goalies , one older than me by four years , the other one by three and the coaches decided to bet on them. ” ( Note : both already quit playing ) . At the end of the season , Georgiev left his native Russia to start a new chapter in his life and career .
Moving to Finland
“ At the end of my season in MHL , I had a chance for a tryout in Finland . I was very happy about it and decided to try. ” The Bulgaria-native said that at those times he was n't interested in seeking other opportunities in the domestic market .
In his new home , he found differences almost right away : “ In the training process , there were some obvious differences . In particular , a different approach to the offseason . And also , there are different exercises in the off-ice practice . For example , I first met the ‘ power clean ' practice in Finland . In Russia , we ran a lot more during the offseason . Each morning we would be ordered to run for eight kilometers . And that was just the warm-up . ”
There were many things to adapt to in hockey , but for his off-ice life he had some helping hands : “ I had three persons in the main team who knew Russian , two Czechs and one Lithuanian . In the junior team , however , no one was talking in Russian . But I talk a good English , therefore , I had no problems . ”
After playing three years in Finland , and representing Team Russia at the 2016 WJC in Finland , Georgiev was signed by the New York Rangers to an entry-level contract . But rather than an achievement , this is a new starting point for the netminder : “ [ Signing with the Rangers ] I got a lot closer to fulfilling my dreams , ” he said .
During the July rookie camp , Georgiev had a chance to work directly with the team 's goaltending coach Benoit Allaire . “ I worked with him only a few days , but he managed to give me some good precious advice regarding my technique . I ca n't wait to start working with him again , I 'm sure that he 'll have a lot of interesting stuff to teach me . ”
Georgiev and the New York Rangers
Georgiev is truly thrilled about being part of the Rangers organization . “ On the one hand , it 's maybe better not to get drafted at all , as you can freely choose the team to play for . But on the other hand , if you get drafted the team is somewhat expecting you and will then try to prepare you to fit their team . ”
Playing in the AHL does n't scare Georgiev : “ I will start next year playing in the AHL . I 'm ready to play in that league , play well and waiting for my chance in the NHL. ” The goalie also said he did not have any offer from KHL teams . “ I have n't heard from [ KHL teams ] . And also right now I 'm only thinking about the Rangers . ”
Earlier , the New York-based team signed the defenseman Alexei Bereglazov , and the lineup also features Russian forward Pavel Buchnevich and defenseman Sergei Zborovskiy . “ I befriended Alexei Bereglazov during the development camp . And I also knew Sergei Zborovskiy , with whom I played at the WJC . He is also under contract with the Rangers . I have n't met Buchnevich yet . ”
At this point , Georgiev is probably just a couple of years from making the Rangers ' lineup . As King Henrik is getting older , it 's vital for them to explore new goaltending options .

The Michigan Department of Education confirmed on Monday it approved a preparation and certification program by Teachers of Tomorrow , which allows the company to begin offering potential educators a license through the Michigan Alternative Route to Interim Teacher Certification . ( Photo : Clarence Tabb , Jr. / Detroit News file )
A new teacher certification program approved in Michigan to address critical teacher shortage in the state is not supported by the state 's largest teachers unions .
The Michigan Department of Education confirmed on Monday it approved a preparation and certification program by Teachers of Tomorrow , which allows the company to begin offering potential educators a license through the Michigan Alternative Route to Interim Teacher Certification .
The program allows candidates who have a bachelor 's degree but have not completed a teacher preparation program to be hired as a teacher while completing the certification requirements . Candidates also must have passing scores on the Michigan Test for Teacher Certification .
The state legislature created the alternative route to licensing in 2009 but no teachers have been certified through the new route so far , officials with Teachers of Tomorrow said .
Officials at the Michigan Department of Education said the department works in close partnership with several alternate route programs that all are focused on addressing the need for well-trained and passionate teachers to serve the state 's K-12 population .
“ We are proud to enter into a new partnership with Teachers Of Tomorrow to address that need . We support their efforts to attract more teachers to the profession , ” said Martin Ackley , a spokesman for the Michigan Department of Education .
An official with the state 's largest teachers union , the Michigan Education Association , says the organization is against the move .
“ MEA opposes this pseudo-certification route , ” MEA spokesman David Crim said Monday .
“ This appears to be another way to turn education over to for-profit corporations . Would you want your child 's third grade teacher to have received their ‘ certification ' from an online program , or would you rather they go through a five- year program at one of our colleges of education , which would include a year of student teaching in a classroom under a certified , mentor teacher ? ” Crim said .
“ Reducing the qualifications to become a certified teacher is yet another attempt to deprofessionalize the teaching profession and is certainly not in the best interests of Michigan students or parents , ” he said .
David Hecker , a spokesman with the American Federation of Teachers in Michigan , said Michigan already has alterantive teacher certification programs and it does n't need any more .
“ It 's totally unnecessary . If you want to address the teacher shortage , let 's have fair school funding , let 's pay teachers fair compensation , let 's have smaller class sizes , let 's restore teacher voices that the Republican-controlled Legislature has taken away , let 's return retirement security for teachers – that 's how you address teacher shortages , ” Hecker said Monday .
Teacher shortages vary by district and are not tracked by the state , Ackley said . The number of teachers in Michigan dropped from 102,208 in 2012-13 to 98,481 in 2016-17 , he said .
There has been a significant decrease in enrollments in educator preparation programs , according to Michigan education data . Enrollment dropped from 14,372 in 2012 to 11,099 in 2014 and at the same time , retirements continue to grow .
Vernon Reaser , CEO of Teachers of Tomorrow , said while some districts are not seeing a teacher shortage , many subject areas such as science , math , special education and English as a second language have extreme shortages . Many rural and urban schools struggle to find the talent they need .
“ Michigan , like many states , is now seeing the impact of declining education school enrollment and we are excited to help school districts quickly address a growing teacher shortage , ” Reaser said . “ We are honored to be one of the first MARITC programs to be approved to help Michigan schools find the talent they need , and we do it at zero cost to the school and districts . ”
A teacher shortage at Detroit Public Schools Community District persists as the start of school nears Sept. 5 .
The district is holding two teacher recruitment fairs this month – one on Thursday and another on Aug. 31 – but school will begin regardless on the day after Labor Day for an estimated 47,950 students .
District officials said a district-wide teacher shortage has left 260 teacher vacancies . The district has about 2,700 teachers .
At the fairs , applications are being accepted for all teaching positions , but a critical need for teachers exists in math , science , English language arts , special education , music , Spanish , K-5 elementary , social studies and career technical education .
The district also is hiring retirees for special education , science , math and Spanish classes .
A $ 617 million state bailout for DPSCD gives local officials the option to allow noncertified teachers in the district .

Teachers of Tomorrow has waived the $ 295 initial program fee so that potential teachers can get started at no cost through Nov. 30 . Those interested in applying to become a certified teacher in Michigan can call 866-441-7076 for more information .

Montgomery is the new home of Alabama 's first U.S . Citizenship and Immigration Services Field Office .
Acting Director James McCament cut the ribbon on the new office and administrated the Oath of Allegiance to five individuals during a naturalization ceremony Wednesday .
McCament said Flag Day was the appropriate holiday for Wednesday 's event , celebrating the fabric of the United States and its rich history that would be incomplete without the efforts of immigr ants .
The new office will employ 34 workers , who will address all issues related to those seeking citizenship , refugee and asylum status .
“ It was an exciting opportunity to use this former Social Security site , and rehab , ” McCament said . “ We took it down to the bare structure and rebuilt the office inside . It 's important to have access to our customers . ”
The new facility was dedicated to the late James Avery , a Medal of Honor recipient , who served in the Union Army in the Civil War . Avery was described as a hero and immigr ant who made a great contribution to the United States .
“ Today is the culmination of the immigration journey , ” McCament said . “ Immigration and our efforts go back to the founding , and there are always questions and folks have opinions . But no one would disagree when you come to the end of the immigr ant journey , and you see folks become citizens and see the same level of effort that helped them leave their home country , take a very big risk in many ways in starting over . That same drive in contribution lends to the day after they become a citizen , which is why we have so many immigr ants who have contributed to the fabric of this country for so many generations . ”
The USCIS Office is located at 3382 Atlanta Highway .

AWE , in its application , said that CERCG 's bid fails to address a rival offer by Mineral Resources and does not sufficiently disclose whether funding is available for CERCG to carry out its bid , the panel said .
AWE believed shareholders did not have enough information to properly assess the merits of CERCG 's bid and sought an interim order to restrain the despatch of CERCG 's bid statement .
The Takeovers Panel said it had not made a decision on whether to conduct proceedings over AWE 's application .
CERCG is the lowest bidder in a three-way bidding war for the oil and gas explorer . Earlier this week , AWE gave Mineral Resources till midnight Friday to match a A $ 594 million ( $ 480 million ) takeover offer from Mitsui & Co , or it would back the Japanese bid as a superior offer .
AWE 's stock has risen more than 80 percent , since it received CERCG 's takeover bid in late November .
HONG KONG - Thousands of protesters , chanting `` Sovereignty belongs to the people ! '' marched through Hong Kong on New Year 's Day to protest at the government 's legal bid to unseat some pro-democracy lawmakers . The four popularly elected legislators , who led the rally , were the latest targets of a government move which pro-democracy parties describe as a witch hunt .
It came after the city 's courts ousted two pro-independence lawmakers for failing to swear their oaths of office correctly , a move backed by Beijing . The Hong Kong government now wants to bar the other four legislators for alleged breaches in their swearing-in ceremony and in their oaths of allegiance . `` We can see that under Hong Kong 's rule of law , the government , with its unlimited resources , will use legal procedures to bully leaders and representatives with fewer resources , '' Joshua Wong , a prominent student leader , told AFP at the rally .
`` This has shown that 'One Country , Two Systems ' is a failure and we should use the 20th anniversary of the handover to reflect on our political situation . ''
Britain handed Hong Kong back to China in 1997 under a deal which gives it broad autonomy and preserves its freedoms and the rule of law for 50 years . But there are fears these freedoms are being eroded by Beijing .
`` The four lawmakers are genuinely concerned about the future of Hong Kong to ensure that our core values will be maintained , '' Peggy Ng , a retired civil servant , told AFP at the rally . `` Particularly , that our next generations will enjoy the freedoms that I have enjoyed before . ''
Court proceedings against the four are scheduled to start in February . Organisers of the march said 9,150 people attended , while police estimated an maximum attendance of 4,800 . A 1,200-strong pro-Beijing committee will elect Hong Kong 's next leader in March . The current unpopular chief executive Leung Chun-ying has announced he will not seek re-election , citing family reasons .
Banners at the march caricatured the likely election candidates and highlighted their pro-establishment positions .
Sunday 's rally also sought to raise funds for the four lawmakers to fight the government 's challenge in court . The two ousted pro-independence lawmakers separately announced last week they were making a final legal bid to overturn their exclusion from the legislature .

Peterborough United defender Andrew Hughes is looking to put the blow of a defeat to Blackburn behind him as Posh gear up for a “ massive ” FA Cup replay against Woking .
Posh will earn a trip to Championship side Aston Villa if they win the second round replay at the ABAX Stadium on Tuesday ( December 12 ) against non-league Woking .
Jack Marriott of Peterborough United challenges for the ball with Paul Downing of Blackburn Rovers - Mandatory by-line : Joe Dent/JMP - 09/12/2017 - FOOTBALL - ABAX Stadium - Peterborough , England - Peterborough United v Blackburn Rovers - Sky Bet League One
They will hope for a better result in front of their home fans than yesterday 's result ( Saturday , December 9 ) after Charlie Mulgrew and two goals from Bradley Dack early in the second-half earned Blackburn a 3-2 win .
Steven Taylor had headed Posh into a 11th minute lead , while Jack Marriott tapped in a late consolation , although Posh played the final few seconds with 10 men after Baldwin received a second yellow card for fouling Dack .
Left-back Hughes said : “ I think once we conceded we just needed to keep doing what we were doing beforehand .
“ We 've shown we are a good team . Blackburn is no mugs , so to go out and play the way we did and take the game to them at times is credit to us .
“ We 've got a massive game Tuesday . All the boys are in a good mindset and I think we 've just got to switch to that .
“ It is a big game - individually and for the club - and it will be good to get into the next round .
“ It 's a busy period , it comes every year . No-one 's a stranger to that . Once a game 's gone you forget about it win , lose or draw . ”
Posh have slipped to 10th in the League One table after Saturday 's defeat , but Hughes said the entire squad is convinced that the play-offs are a realistic goal this season .
He added : “ Everyone knows Blackburn is a good team , but on our day we can beat anyone . Our first-half display just goes to show that . We just needed to repeat it second-half .
“ Losing three goals was a blow , but we could have got something out of that .
“ We created some good chances , and to go in at half-time one-nil up was credit to us .
“ There 's not one player in the changing room that does not think we ca n't get in the play-offs .
“ We 've had a good pre-season under our belts , everyone is close knit and everyone 's looking forward to the second-half of the season . ”
After maintaining a quiet presence for quite a while , Magic Leap is finally feeling a bit more chatty , at least when it comes to what they 're sharing with developers .
As the Game Developers Conference kicks off in San Francisco this week , Magic Leap is opening up their “ Creator Portal ” to developers sharing their SDK , tutorials , design guidelines and forums .
After agreeing to a quick little arbitration clause you can dive into see more about what can be done on the Magic Leap One .
What Magic Leap is trying to do is still very much a new concept for game and app design in general so a decent amount of space is put into walking through basic design guidelines that it sees as useful for spatial computing . The company breaks down the basics as well as audio and animation tips , the stuff there is n't too technical , it 's more about making sure people are going into the design process realizing that this is n't just a mobile app in front of your eyes .
The Lumin SDK is designed for Magic Leap 's operating system Lumin OS which we 're now learning is a custome OS built from open source and Linux-based components . Developers building in Unity and Unreal will have access to build for Lumin OS .
It appears as though the company 's App Store will be called Magic Leap World , there 's not a ton to go off of , but the site says that using it , developer can “ create and manage your development team , then give them access to all of the tools they need to successfully share your creations with the world . ”
On the guidelines front , it appears the company will be giving developers access to tutorials that provide more details on how to get going with building for the hardware . Right now , there is only a tutorial showcasing details on setting up the positionally tracked Controller .
There is n't anything super mind-blowing here that I 've seen yet , but I 'll be continuing to scour just to be sure .

AUGUST 14 , 2017 — Built by Spanish shipbuilder Astilleros Amon , the two latest DP2 high-speed catamarans to join the SEACOR Marine fleet , the SEACOR Puma and SEACOR Panther , have significantly more horsepower than her predecessors .
The vessels are each fitted with four of Cummins Marine 's newest QSK95 marine engines , each rated at 4,000 hp ( 2.983 kW ) at 1,700 rpm , delivering a total 16,000 bhp and giving the vessels a maximum speed of 40 knots . Each 95-liters engine is matched to a MGX-62500SC-H marine transmissions supplied by Twin Disc , Inc. and quad HT-810 water jets from Hamilton Jet , to achieve a maximum speed of 40 knots .
The two forward engines will run Jason FiFi 1 class pumps off the front of the engine .
`` These engines afford us with additional horsepower over the previous catamarans propulsion machinery , '' said SEACOR 's Project Manager , Joe McCall . `` The mission of these vessels will be the same as the previous catamarans , to deliver time sensitive cargos and passengers at grater speeds than a typical crew-boat . Additionally , the sea-keeping qualities afforded by the twin hulls , ensures that the passengers will have a very fast and comfortable ride . ''
`` Another quality that is important to our customers is the reliability of the vessel , '' added Mr. McCall . `` These vessels have multiple independent and redundant systems . ''
Cummins is also providing auxiliary power ; each vessel will have two QSM11-powered generator sets rated at 290 kWe , as well as a fully enclosed QSM11-powered deck generator rated at 270 kWe .
The twin hulls allow for a huge 3,084 square foot ( 286.5 sq . meters ) clear cargo deck , capable of handling 200 tons of freight . Tankage is provided in the hulls for 25,437 U.S. gallons ( 96.3 cu.meters ) of fuel oil and 6,870 U.S. gallons ( 26 cu.m . ) of potable water .

Why Restaurant Owners Should Consider Fixed Seating Arrangements
If you 're a restaurant owner or planning to open your first restaurant , chances are that you 've thought of different seating arrangements to maximize on the space you have . From fixed seating to movable seating and banquette seating , where you use the interior features of your restaurant space to create unique seating arrangements , there are many options to consider .
Among all the options available , fixed seating is considered by most restaurant owners as the most ideal option . It 's what you 'll find across the hospitality industry , from hotels , pubs , cafes , bars to your favorite corner restaurant in your neighborhood . It 's an iconic feature of any modern interior design for restaurants , because it gives space unique character .
So , why should you consider a fixed sitting arrangement for your restaurant ?
Maximize Your Restaurant 's Interior Features
One great thing about fixed seating is that it 's designed to your restaurant 's interior design specifications . Considering that every restaurant is unique , you 'll definitely be able to come up with a seating arrangement that speaks your personal thoughts and ideas . According to a leading provider of seating solutions , you can take advantage of the interior features in your restaurant to create a stylish space with its own unique character : Click here for more .
With fixed seating options , you can easily add some extra seating in an otherwise unusable space in your restaurant . It enables you to utilize all available chair and table space near walls and in corners . With chairs , customers will normally need space to pull them out and sit down , but with fixed corner seats and wall benches , you do n't have to worry about that .
Customers Love Fixed Seating Arrangements
Most customers are more comfortable with fixed seating , because it adds a level of privacy to their dining experience . A corner booth or secluded seating bench on a wall feels more like an enclosed space that 's exclusive to dinners . The spaces you create are wholly for customers , and dinners do n't have to scoot in their chair to make way for other customers .
Privacy when dining is important to customers . With fixed seating , it 's easy to customize your seating arrangement to maximize customer privacy . For instance , you can increase the height of your seats ' back to offer some level of privacy . An online blog notes that booths represent the most efficient seating option when you want to maximize restaurant seating space .
It Makes Group Bookings Easier for You
Every restaurant owner wants to maximize bookings for large groups or parties . What better way to do that than to create some separate space for group dining with fixed seating design . A wall bench at one end of your restaurant could be a great way to make bookings easier . Fixed seating can help you create an exclusive space where groups can dine away from other customers .
Fixed seating is also a great option for children . If your restaurant serves family meals or frequently gets bookings with lots of children , you 'll be able to fit more kids on a bench or fixed wall or corner seating arrangement than you would if you had a chair for each kid . There is no doubt that fixed seating enables customers to easily adapt their seating preferences .
It Looks Great and is Completely Customizable
Simply put , a fixed seating arrangement for your restaurant looks great . The most important thing though , is ensuring that you find a good interior designer and builder who can actualize your ideas and design plans into reality . They should be able to design your furniture to suit your restaurant 's environment , while taking advantage of the key features and the space available .
One of the most unique selling points of having a fixed restaurant seating arrangement is that it 's entirely customizable . You can choose whatever design you want . From rise & fall back seats , embroidery seats , hinged seating to Chester button seats , you have different options to choose from . What matters most in restaurant design is creating a desirable space .

Once the initial shock subsides and the immediate job of calling for strength and solidarity is over , the public 's gaze inevitably turns inwards ; it asks for explanation , attributes blame and demands action .
Following yet another terror attack in Lahore , the citizenry is asking hard questions and our politicians must answer .
On the dock is also the military , which is quick to declare victory and claim credit for triumph , but stands bereft of responsibility when things go wrong .
Collectively the state must answer , why has it been unable to eliminate Jamaat-ul-Ahrar , why do religious extremists still enjoy the state 's leniency , and who is to blame for the state 's constant failure to protect its people ?
The opposition believes the government is to blame .
Almost in a single voice , most political parties have condemned the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz ( PML-N ) for failing to implement the National Action Plan ( NAP ) in its full potential , and pinned the blame for the residual traces of terrorism on them .
While this criticism rings true – seminary reform was abandoned and extremists in Punjab still move about with impunity – this automatic blaming of the government for every attack by the opposition is an overly simplistic picture .
The provinces administered by the opposition have fared no better , and in the case of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa ( KP ) , Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaaf has actually given millions to actively militant seminaries such as Madrassa Haqqania .
Seminary reform and other anti-terror laws are the responsibility of the opposition too , who has to push the government in the right direction , but it was too busy skewering the Prime Minister for the Panama scandal to care about what really matters .
However , it is difficult to sympathise with the government when its leaders maintain such a shameful dismissive attitude about their own people .
A day after the attack , with the carnage still fresh in the streets and the victims struggling for life in various hospitals , the Punjab Minister Rana Sanaullah has blamed the victims for the attack , saying “ had there been no protest demonstration , this incident would not have occurred ” .
Not only are such comments highly inappropriate and disrespectful , but also emblematic of the problem – instead of thinking how it could protect the people better , the government 's first instinct is to protect itself , by blaming the victims no less .
This is a shameful move , even by Rana Sanaullah 's standards .
The government has to own up to its responsibility as must the military .
The nation has been told a narrative of success in the military operations but attacks continue to happen regularly and effortlessly .
The military must reverse is narrative of victory , or get back to work eliminating the militants left .
The state is responsible for this senseless loss of life , and the state must answer .

* Q3 adjusted earnings fall 2 pct
* Costs rise while questions raised about growth
* BT reiterates full-year outlook ( Adds CEO comments , analyst reaction , shares )
By Paul Sandle
LONDON , Feb 2 ( Reuters ) - Steps to improve customer service and the cost of providing new premium handsets including the iPhone X squeezed quarterly earnings at BT , sending shares in Britain 's biggest broadband and mobile provider to a five-year low on Friday .
Shares in BT slid almost six percent as analysts questioned where growth would come from after a turbulent 2017 that included an accounting scandal in Italy .
Mobile brand EE was the only part of the company to enjoy sales growth as the group reported adjusted core earnings down 2 percent to 1.8 billion pounds ( $ 2.6 billion ) on revenue down 3 percent at 5.97 billion pounds in the three months to the end of December .
Analysts at Jefferies said revenue had come in 1.4 percent short of expectations , while there was a 1.5 percent miss on core earnings , reinforcing its view that it would be a challenge for the group to meet its own guidance for the year .
“ Looking across the divisions , an absence of growth remains the striking impression , ” said the broker , which has a “ hold ” rating on the stock .
BT Chief Executive Gavin Patterson said the performance in the third quarter of its financial year was broadly in line with its expectations , “ We remain confident in our outlook for the full year , ” he said .
Patterson , in the role since 2013 , has to balance a variety of demands on BT 's cash flow as well as maintaining its progressive dividend policy .
Costs include investing in fibre networks , seeking to retain Premier League soccer rights for its TV service and plugging a pension deficit .
The group 's Global Services division , the source of a profit warning in its previous financial year , is also being restructured against a backdrop of tough market conditions .
However , Patterson pointed to progress in improving customer service in its consumer business , long below the industry average according to regulator Ofcom .
“ We have seen our sixth quarter in a row of improving customer satisfaction as a result of sustained investment that we are making in service , ” he told reporters .
Complaints in BT broadband were down 31 percent down year-on-year , he said .
BT moved on to the front foot against criticism of the speed of its broadband services on Thursday , when it announced a more ambitious plan to take ultrafast full-fibre broadband to 3 million homes and businesses .
Patterson said the higher costs of the new iPhone 8 and iPhone X had increased customer acquisition costs at EE . EE added 235,000 contract customers in the period .
The company 's outlook for the full year sees broadly flat underlying revenue , with core earnings falling to between 7.5 billion and 7.6 billion pounds .
Analysts doubt it can meet its earnings target though , predicting they will come in below that range at 7.475 billion pounds , according to Thomson Reuters data . ( $ 1 = 0.7011 pounds )

From Conor McGregor 's crowning as a two-weight world champion to the unsuccessful return of Ronda Rousey , the UFC delivered again in 2016 .
While Joanna Jedrzejczyk and Demetrious Johnson remain dominant in their divisions , the women 's bantamweight crown and men 's lightweight title repeatedly changed hands .
And with plenty of questions left unanswered , 2017 promises to be another action-packed year .
Here are five fights we would like to see made .
Jon Jones vs Daniel Cormier II
It is perfectly plausible to suggest this fight is cursed . Almost two years since their first meeting , we are no closer to seeing Jones and Cormier touch gloves in the Octagon again after an injury to the latter ( UFC 197 ) and a failed drug test by the former ( UFC 200 ) . But while some have abandoned hope , if Cormier can see off Anthony Johnson is their soon-to-be-announced re-arranged rematch and Jones can keep himself out of trouble in the lead up to his summer return , we might finally see the light-heavyweights trade leather once again .

Conor McGregor vs Khabib Nurmagomedov
Whether his featherweight belt was taken away or given up , McGregor looks set to remain at 155lb for the foreseeable future , even if the next few months of his life will be taken up by nappies , not grappling . Once the Dubliner becomes a father in May , his attention will return to the Octagon and waiting for him there will likely be one of two men : Tony Ferguson or Khabib Nurmagomedov . The obvious fight in the division is between those to for the interim lightweight title , even if president Dana White ruled it out last week . If anyone can end Ferguson 's stunning nine-fight winning streak , it is the Russian , which would set up a mouthwatering meeting for later in the year .

Jimi Manuwa vs Ryan Bader
It has been a turbulent three years for the Londoner with defeat by Alexander Gustafsson followed by a year on the sidelines through injury . He returned to outpoint Jan Blachowicz - the first time Manuwa had gone the distance in his career - but was brought back down to earth five months later by a second-round KO courtesy of Anthony Johnson . Injury hit again but again he rebounded well with a stunning stoppage of Ovince Saint Preux at UFC 204 in Manchester . Meanwhile , Bader has beaten Antonio Rogerio Nogueira and Ilir Latifi since suffering his own defeat by Johnson . This match-up would be must-win for both men if they are to have a realistic shot at the light-heavyweight title .

Demian Maia vs Tyron Woodley/Stephen Thompson
The last thing Maia needed was a draw between Tyron Woodley and Stephen Thompson but that 's exactly what they delivered back in November . Assuming that rematch is made in the coming months , Maia should be announced as the winner 's next opponent , although an eliminator against the busiest man on the roster , Donald Cerrone , would be a satisfying alternative . With the Brazilian on a six-fight win streak and Cerrone just two behind , they are the obvious next challengers .
Cris Cyborg vs Holly Holm/Germaine de Randamie
After two defeats in succession following her win over Ronda Rousey , Holly Holm can become the inaugural women 's featherweight champion with victory over Germaine de Randamie . The announcement of the fight - which will headline UFC 208 in February - came as a surprise after the promotion had repeatedly insisted that Invicta 's 145lb champion Cris Cyborg boil down to 135lb is she wanted to compete in the organisation , then overlooked her . But Cyborg 's failed drugs test has cast a cloud over her future and she could face a fight just to compete again in the UFC . Assuming she does , however , she must be in pole position to challenge the first 145lb champion .

Indians star reliever Andrew Miller will make a minor league rehab appearance Wednesday at Triple-A Columbus .
Miller has been on the disabled list since Aug. 2 with soreness in his right knee that had bothered him for weeks . Indians manager Terry Francona said Monday that Cleveland could activate Miller to rejoin the Indians Friday in Kansas City if the rehab appearance goes well .
Miller took part in a bullpen session on Sunday morning , and the Indians said the 32-year-old felt good .
Other than ace Corey Kluber , Miller is the most important pitcher on Cleveland 's staff . He joined the club at the trading deadline in July 2016 and was instrumental in Cleveland winning its first pennant since 1997 . He was dominant in the postseason , going 2-0 with a 1.40 ERA and striking out 30 in 19 innings .
Miller is 4-3 with a 1.67 ERA in 46 games this season . He has 15 walks in 54 innings this season after walking just nine in 74 1/3 innings in 2016 .

A mum claims her teenage son was left `` in agony '' on the side of the road for two hours after a motorbike crash .
Kay Brown says that by the time parademics turned up , her 18-year-old son , Jamie , was `` shaking and his lips were blue '' .
The furious mother says she plans to put in a complaint regarding the actions of the ambulance service .
Jamie was going to see his girlfriend in Hemel Hempstead when he came off his bike near Swindon last weekend , the Bristol Post reports .
A member of the public found the teen , from Yate , south Gloucestershire , by the side of the road shortly after 1pm and rang 999 .

But Kay claims it then took a crew of paramedics more than two hours to reach the teenager , who was by this time suffering severely from shock .
Mrs Brown said : “ I am disgusted really , it is appalling .
“ Jamie was left on the roadside for over two hours in absolute agony because they could n't get there . When they turned up he was shaking and his lips were blue .
`` His arm looked like a slinky it was broken so bad – it was all bent at right angles out of shape .
“ Thankfully his injuries were n't too bad , but it does n't bear thinking about what could have been if they had been worse .
“ It is every parent 's worst nightmare . ”
Jamie came off his motorbike on Cirencester Road last Sunday after his back wheel skidded on some loose gravel .

The teenager crashed into a hedge and managed to flag down a passing car before collapsing in the road .
The car driver called for an ambulance and was joined by an off duty policeman about 20 minutes after the crash .
Mrs Brown claims the police officer then radioed the South West Ambulance Service ( SWAS ) to ask for an update on the status of the paramedics , only to be told that an ambulance had not been sent .
The mother says that the officer then asked for one to be dispatched , which the call handler promised to arrange .
Mrs Brown arrived on the scene shortly before 2pm after being called by the passing driver .
She said : “ It seemed to take hours to get there . When me and my husband pulled up the police officer had put a sign up to shield Jamie from the sun , but I honestly thought it was to stop the public from seeing something awful .

“ When we arrived I could only see his legs sticking out from behind the sign and I immediately thought the worst . ”
The anxious mother says she was comforted by the police officer who stayed with Jamie until the ambulance arrived .
“ He was so good to us , ” Mrs Brown said .
The mother said the ambulance crew told her , when they arrived , that they had been sent from Cinderford in Herefordshire which is more than an hour away .
Jamie , who works at Tesco , was taken to Swindon Hospital where he was found to have broken his arm in two places and broken his wrist in two places . He also sustained severe bruising to his legs and ankles .
Mrs Brown said : “ The doctor told him it was like a bomb had gone off inside his arm – his bone was shattered in to that many fragments . ”
The teenager had a three-hour operation to pin the bones back together on Monday and will likely have to undergo further surgery on his arm in the future .

Jamie is back home and coming to terms with the crash , but his family are left feeling angry at the slow response from the ambulance service .
Mrs Brown says she plans to put in a complaint to SWAS in an attempt to prevent this from happening again .
She said : “ What if his injuries had been much worse ? What would of happened then ? Two hours is not acceptable . ”
Mirror Online has contacted SWAS for a response .
This is the last Jolt until October 10 . Happy Columbus Day ! Celebrate by going someplace you 've never been before and calling it “ India . ”
Forget a Millionaires ' Tax , Virginia Has a Seventeen-Thousand-aires ' Tax
The campaign of Virginia gubernatorial candidate Ed Gillespie unveils a new ad today :
BLOCK
GILLESPIE : “ Virginia 's top personal income tax rate kicks in at $ 17,000 a year . Ralph Northam thinks that makes you rich . Maybe that 's why he 's never voted for a tax cut . My plan cuts taxes for all Virginians , increasing take-home pay for the average family by nearly $ 1,300 and creating 53,000 good-paying jobs . With a stronger economy , we can invest more in our schools and increase teacher pay . I 'm Ed Gillespie , candidate for governor , and I sponsored this ad . ”
Northam 's accusation that $ 17,000 in income makes you rich stems from this exchange at their debate September 19 :
NORTHAM : This plan , ladies and gentlemen , that you just heard , is a tax cut for the rich at the expense of the working class , and you have to look no further than Kansas to see exactly what a plan such as this would do . It almost bankrupts them . They actually had to turn around and raise taxes . It put schools in jeopardy . They went from a five day week to a four day week . Let me tell you what we need to do in Virginia . We need to invest in Virginia . Because when we invest in Virginia we can beat , as I said earlier , any other state . . . .
Northam went on to call for more transportation spending and education spending . Gillespie responded :
GILLESPIE : This is really important . This is very important . First of all , Ralph says these are tax cuts for the rich . These are tax cuts for all Virginians . And the fact is , if you paid $ 7,000 in taxes under current law under my plan , when fully implemented responsibly phased in over three years , you would have $ 700 less in tax burden , that you could spend as you see fit for your family . Virginians need that tax relief . Tax cut for the rich — the top rate in Virginia , 5.75 percent kicks in at an income level of $ 17,000 a year . I did n't say $ 70,000 ; I said $ 17,000 . And my opponent thinks you 're rich and that 's just flat wrong .
Virginia 's tax rates can be found here , and the state 's top tax rate does indeed kick in after $ 17,000 in income . As the state helpfully points out , if your taxable income is $ 54,000 , your tax is $ 720 + 5.75 percent of the amount over $ 17,000 . This comes out to $ 2,848 .
Northam spent six years in the state Senate and never voted for a tax cut at all ?
Unanswered Questions and Another Era of American Paranoia
It 's been five days since the worst mass shooting in American history , and the public still does n't know the Las Vegas shooter 's motive .
The investigation into what drove Stephen Paddock to open fire on a music festival in Las Vegas last Sunday is crawling into its fifth day with ever-mounting questions and few answers . Paddock , the lone suspect according to Las Vegas police , killed himself in the hotel suite he had rented on the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino as police closed in on his location . And along with Paddock went any clear answer for why he opened fire on the festival and killed 58 people and wounded 489 others . Clark County Sheriff Joseph Lombardo , the public face of the investigation , has had few answers for why Paddock committed the crime . Authorities did not hold a press conference on Thursday , the first day since Sunday there was none . Lombardo has said investigators are looking at a computer and multiple electronic devices found in the suite at the Mandalay Bay hotel . Authorities have also removed evidence from homes Paddock owned in Mesquite and Reno , Nevada . There have not been any revelations so far . Authorities also found a note in Paddock 's hotel room but said it was not a suicide note . The contents are unknown .
A couple of the retired law enforcement talking heads on the network assure us that the FBI knows more than they are saying . I hope the good men and women at the Bureau understand that we 're rapidly approaching a moment where the public could use some reassurance . We 're used to certain explanations for a sudden horror like this : he 's a jihadist ( Orlando ) , he 's an angry , disturbed teenager ( Columbine ) , he 's got some extreme political agenda ( the Alexandria Congressional baseball practice shooter ) .
It 's a new level of troubling to think that someone could spend months planning an elaborate massacre – perhaps an entire year ? – hide it from everyone who knew him , and not even have any discernable motive . We have a certain set of behaviors we 've consciously or subconsciously learned to be on alert for – i.e. , jihadism , angry disturbed teenagers , or extreme political views .
One of the better discussions of the week came from a fellow on Twitter who felt perplexed about Americans ' attachment to their guns and observed , accurately , I think , “ This goes beyond rights , hunting , collectors . People are afraid and preparing . It 's not a sign of a healthy society . ”
( Yesterday President Trump said to reporters , without elaborating , “ this is the calm before the storm . ” )
Trust in government has been declining for a long time , but it has n't declined steadily . It declined steeply after Watergate , rebounded healthily during the Reagan and Bush presidencies , took a steep dive a end of the George H.W . Bush presidency , gradually had a modest recovery during the Clinton presidency , jumped back up after 9/11 , and declined from about mid-Bush , throughout the Obama presidency , and into Trump 's .
Republican administrations earned their share of the blame for the erosion of public trust : Iran-Contra , the failure to find the expected weapons of mass destruction in Iraq , the difficulties in the response to Hurricane Katrina , the bursting of the housing bubble and onset of the Great Recession in 2008…
Now throw in , “ if you like your plan , you can keep your plan , ” “ jayvee team , ” the initial claim that Benghazi was a protest that got out of control , the characterization of the Fort Hood shooting as “ workplace violence , ” the initial claim that the San Bernardino attack was also “ workplace violence , ” the claims that the Orlando attack was a result of “ Republican hate ” and homophobia . The FBI initially redacted all references to ISIS in the transcript of the Orlando shooter 's call .
It is not wildly irrational to believe that there are some people out there who want to kill you , and that the United States government is n't willing to be honest with you about the situation .
But those who have long memories or who have studied history may dispute that this is the most paranoid , frightening , or dangerous moment in American life .
When you think about times when it felt like American society was coming apart at the seams , I can only imagine how Americans felt in 1974 when the long-lost kidnapped heiress Patty Hearst reappeared , only to have been brainwashed into becoming a bank robber for a cult/terrorist group , the Symbionese Liberation Army . The level of political violence in the early 1970s is jaw-dropping today :
The first actual bombing campaign , the work of a group of New York City radicals led by a militant named Sam Melville , featured attacks on a dozen buildings around Manhattan between August and November 1969 , when Melville and most of his pals were arrested . Weather 's attacks began three months later , and by 1971 protest bombings had spread across the country . In a single eighteen-month period during 1971 and 1972 the FBI counted an amazing 2,500 bombings on American soil , almost five a day . Because they were typically detonated late at night , few caused serious injury , leading to a kind of grudging public acceptance . The deadliest underground attack of the decade , in fact , killed all four people , in the January 1975 bombing of a Wall Street restaurant . News accounts rarely carried any expression or indication of public outrage .
That 's before my time , but the paranoia of the 1990s was n't . Start with the first World Trade Center bombing , then move on to Waco , Ruby Ridge , the Oklahoma City bombing , the bombing at the Atlanta Olympics , TWA Flight 800 , John F. Kennedy Jr. 's death in a plane crash , and EgyptAir flight 990 suddenly descending and crashing into the ocean with a seemingly calm pilot at the controls .
It 's not surprising that The X-Files was a hit and Art Bell was a sensation on radio during those years , because the nightly news was turning twisted and weird and disturbing . Jeffrey Dahmer ate people . That old football star who was in wacky comedies was charged with murdering two people . A Long Island teenager shot her married lover 's wife , and turned into some sort of weird celebrity . A rivalry between Olympic figure skating stars turned violent .
When things are bad , and weird , and ominous , it helps to remember . . . we 've been though variations of this before , and managed to pull through . We 'll get through this , too .
ADDENDA : A perfectly faux-inspiring slogan from my friend Lisa De Pasquale 's new book , The Social Justice Warrior Handbook : “ The only thing necessary for the triumph of good over evil is to tweet about it . ”
The royal baby might not have a name yet , but he does already have a royal baby-themed commemorative china collection available , thanks to the Royal Collection Trust . His Royal Highness Prince of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland arrived on April 23 , 2018 in the late morning , meaning he 's only a day old , and as of press time , still without an official name . But that 's not stopping Buckingham Palace from debuting the commissioned four-piece china collection in his honor , because what says welcome to the world like some elegant dishes ? Besides , the collection is really more of a gesture for his royal parents , Prince William and Kate , and surely they know how to appreciate the celebratory gesture . They 've already had a commemorative plate collection for their son George , their daughter Charlotte , and their royal wedding . Needless to say , they 're good on their decorative plate collection .
If you 're wondering just how elegant are these dishes are , I assure you they 're just about as fancy as they can get — definitely not the kind of plates you 're going to slop your avocado toast onto or use for dinner parties . In total , the range includes a plate , a tankard , a pillbox , and a bonus embroidered decorative pram . According to the Royal Collection Trust , the dishes are not safe for dishwashers or microwaving , meaning they 're more for looking and less for touching — but that 's easy to see just from looking at them .
The dishes are gilded with 22-carat gold and made in Stoke-on-Trent , the ceramic capital of the world . The methods in which the fine bone china dishes were made in Stoke-on-Trent are traditional and unchanged for over 250 years . The special town is so well known for their ceramic industries that it 's been dubbed `` The Potteries , '' and people from around the world travel there just to shop or admire the work that 's produced there . Though it 's not surprising The Royal Trust sources their ceramics from the most acclaimed workshop in the world that just so happens to be local and in England .
While the royal china range in not yet available for purchase , you can check it out and be added to a notification waitlist that will alert you once it is available , if you are interested . Some of the proceeds will go towards the Royal Collection Trust , which is a charity that is not only charge of the conservation of the Royal Collection , but also promotes publications , loans , educational programs and art exhibitions throughout the year . Here 's what will eventually be available :
Tankard

Tankard , $ 55 , Royal Collection Shop

Plate
The Royal Trust
Plate , $ 49 , Royal Collection Shop
The Royal Baby 2018 Commemorative Plate features the lion and unicorn , the `` heraldic supporters of the coat of arms , surmounted by the coronet of The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge '' according to the Royal Trust Collection 's description . And yes , I 'm just as shook as you are that the royals have a unicorn mascot . What a time to be alive .
Pillbox
The Royal Trust
Pillbox , $ 49 , Royal Collection Shop
The Royal Baby 2018 Commemorative Pillbox probably would n't be a great pill holder , but would certainly make a nice paperweight or ring holder , if I might say . Plus , who does n't want more unicorns on display at all times ?
Pram
The Royal Trust
Embroidered Pram , $ 21 , Royal Collection Shop
The Royal Baby 2018 Commemorative Pram is an embroidered decoration is perfect for the Christmas tree . It features glistening gold threads and pearl embellishments , and is just too wee and cute to resist .
No word yet on when exactly the collection will become available for purchase , but stay on your toes , everyone — at the very least , let 's hope Royal Baby # 3 gets an official name before then !
The Olympic Games are largely considered the world 's foremost athletic proving ground , both as a platform for athletes and their countries to assert dominance and as a form of legitimization for the sports they play . New sports are continuously being added to the Olympics and as skateboarding , karate , climbing , and surfing will debut at the 2020 Tokyo games , a door has also been opened for competitive gaming to make an appearance in the 2024 games .
Last August , the Paris 2024 bid team expressed interest in including esports as a medaling event and the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) acknowledged the rapid growth of competitive gaming and released a statement that said “ competitive esports could be considered as a sporting activity , and the players involved prepare and train with an intensity which may be comparable to athletes in traditional sports . ”
Competitive gaming , or esports , is not new and has been around roughly since video games themselves , although for most of its history gaming competitions were not professionally organized . Organized esports are still in their infancy . Professional leagues and tournaments for games like “ Counterstrike , ” Starcraft , ” and “ League of Legends ” only arose after 2000 , however viewership is strong and continues to grow . Blizzard 's new Overwatch League ( OWL ) draws in 100,000 to 180,000 viewers worldwide for its weekly matches and the ” League of Legends ” World Championship drawing over 70 million viewers worldwide . The “ Future-Proofing the Video Game Industry in California ” report by the Milken Institute claimed that professional esports brought in roughly $ 660 million dollars in 2017 and projected that number to grow to over $ 1 billion by 2019 . Currently , 17 colleges including UC Irvine , University of Utah , and Staffordshire University in the United Kingdom offer athletic scholarships for competitive gamers .
“ There 's a movement that 's been going on for a long time but is only now being recognized , ” said Jack Etienne , founder of the Cloud9 esports teams and owner of OWL 's London Spitfire team . “ It took things like Riot Games throwing world tournaments at the Staples Center and having Staples sell out in under an hour . Twice they 've done that , and we 've filled the Bird 's Nest in China . We 've got tens of millions watching these events . It took people watching these events where traditional venues that most people associate with sports are being completely filled up by a specific demographic of folks : young millennials all buying these tickets that are n't generally interested in traditional sports events but love esports . ”
Given this growth , linear television networks and team owners have taken notice of esports ' potential . ESPN , TBS , SyFy , and Telemundo have partnered with competitive gaming platform FACEIT to broadcast esports events . New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft , Sacramento Kings owner Andy Miller , Shaquille O'Neal , and Alex Rodriguez are among the traditional sports figures who have ownership stakes in esports teams . Etienne 's Cloud9 teams recently gained $ 25 million from investors including Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian , Tesla board members Antonio Gracias and Kimbal Musk , Golden State Warriors co-owner Chamath Palihapitiya , Creative Artist Agency co-founder Michael Ovitz , and World Wrestling Entertainment ( WWE ) .
Yet this sentiment of acceptance is not shared by all sports figures and fans . “ Physical sports belong in the Olympics . I do n't think esports belong in the Olympics , ” said two-time Olympic gold medal Alpine skier Ted Ligety in an interview with Reuters .
While competitive games agree that acceptance by fans of traditional sports would be beneficial to their sport , there opinions are divided as to whether that approval is necessary . The London Spitfire 's Jae-Hui “ Gesture ” Hong remarked that professional esports is just as competitive as any other sport and that through their actions and efforts , they can convince doubters rather than trying to force their opinions to change . Others , like Ohanian , attribute the dissent to generational differences and do n't feel the need to try to convince people .
`` What would you say to those who do n't consider esports to be of the same caliber as traditional sports ? '' @ GestureOW `` Rather than force their opinions to change , I hope that we can convice them through our actions '' @ overwatchleague @ Spitfire pic.twitter.com/THflaYNPsd — Matt Fernandez ( @ matt_fern ) February 21 , 2018
Among the prominent existing members in esports , a cult of celebrity similar to that of traditional athletes is already beginning to form , which Ohanian partially attributes to the continuous access fans have to their favorite players provided by social media , where some players have amassed followings of tens or hundreds of thousands of fans across the world .
“ As a sports fan , I followed players from my favorite teams but I never really knew them because their world was really only limited to when they were on the field , ” Ohanian said . “ I feel that a really powerful , underrated part of esports is that fans have a relationship with the players that is almost 24/7 . They can follow them on Twitter or watch them practice on Twitch . Can you imagine if fans bad been this connected to Michael Jordan ? ”
FACEIT co-founder Michele Attisani said that one of the biggest tools that esports has is its community . As young fans grow up and have children of their own , they will instill that same love in their children resulting in a generational shift of attitudes towards acceptance . While no framework is currently in place to foster young talent or provide defined path to a career in professional esports , Etienne suggested that an “ AYSO of esports ” could provide that structure .
Groundwork has already been laid for the birth of Olympic esports . Two days before the opening ceremonies of the 2018 PyeongChang Olympics , the Intel Extreme Masters Pyeongchang “ Starcraft II ” tournament was held in Korea with the support of the IOC , who broadcasted the event on the Olympic Channel . The Olympic Council of Asia has recognized esports as an official event and will be added for the 2018 Asian Games and incorporated as a full medal sport in 2022 . The Asian Games are the second largest multi-sport event outside of the Olympics .
Despite this progress , the IOC is not welcoming competitive gaming with open arms . The IOC would require the creation of an internal governing board for eSports that would set and enforce rules and regulations that ensure compliance with Olympic values . Furthermore , IOC president Thomas Bach said in an interview that Olympic eSports games would not include “ violence , explosions and killing . ”
This kind of stipulation would severely limit the sport 's potential and audience , immediately disqualifying some of the most popular games like first-person shooters ( FPS ) “ Counterstrike ” and “ Overwatch. ” Kent Wakeford , co-founder of KSV esports and chief operating officer of OWL 's Seoul Dynasty team , said that while he understands the concern , he does not believe that all FPS games should be lumped together and that the IOC should be mindful of global tastes when determining which games to include . Etienne commented that such statements by the IOC feel “ disingenuous ” when some Olympic sports “ involve real rifles and boxing , which causes actual , physical damage to a person . ”
The consensus among both players and officials in competitive gaming is that while it would be a great boon for esports to be accepted on a stage as grand as the Olympics , it 's not essential for the growth and survival of the sport . Viewership of the Olympics has declined over the years , with average viewership down 6 % since the Sochi games in 2014 .
“ The Olympics brings the highest level of competition for sports that maybe do n't have a unifying league , but the way I see it is the Olympics needs eSports more than eSports need the Olympics , ” said Houston Outlaws player Jake Lyon during a press conference at the OWL stage one final . “ We 're already building it out ourselves . Esports is so grassroots , so ground up . If the Olympics really wants it , this could happen . ”
The Overwatch League currently streams matches weekly on Twitch from Wednesday to Saturday . The closing ceremonies of the 2018 Winter Olympics will take place on Feb. 25 .

OTTAWA — Two members of the Canadian Forces have been charged with sexually assaulting other military personnel in separate incidents .
National Defence says Cpl . George MacLeod of 36 Combat Engineer Regiment reserve unit in Sydney , N.S. , was charged in relation to an alleged incident during a training exercise at Base Gagetown in New Brunswick in August .
The National Investigation Service offered no other details , saying only that the incident involved another member of the Armed Forces .
In a second case , Master Cpl . Maxime Demers of the Canadian Forces Health Services at Canadian Forces Base Borden , is also facing a charge of sexually assaulting another member at a private residence in Halifax in June 2014 when he was posted to HMCS Charlottetown .
Three people were transported to the hospital following a multi-vehicle accident in North Charleston Wednesday morning .
NCPD officials say shortly before 9:30 am , officers responded to Ashley Phosphate Road at Patriots Boulevard .
According to witnesses , the driver of a white Chevy Tahoe was traveling southbound on Ashley Phosphate at a high rate of speed , and a Ford F-150 was traveling northbound attempting to turn left onto Patriot Blvd .
Police say the Tahoe struck the Ford F-150 , spinning the Ford around striking a silver Honda Accord .
`` The F-150 then lost its right rear wheel , which traveled across Ashley Phosphate striking a Blue Ford F-150 traveling north bound , and then the grey F-150 struck a pedestrian crossing sign and came to rest , '' NCPD officials said . `` The tire from the Ford F-150 struck the trailer of a Ford F-250 causing damage . ''
According to a report , the Tahoe then struck the curb causing it to flip over on its roof , resulting in a fire then was extinguished by firefighters .
Police say the driver of the Honda was entrapped and extracted from the vehicle .

It was previously confirmed that the film producer will plead not guilty to the charges .
Harvey Weinstein will not testify before the grand jury over sex charges on the advice of his lawyers .
The film producer was charged last Friday on two counts of rape and one of a criminal sexual act for alleged incidents involving two separate women .
Weinstein was due to face the grand jury – the panel convened by the Manhattan District Attorney which will decide whether to indict Weinstein – on Wednesday , but his lawyers have advised him not to appear .
They say the former movie mogul did not have enough time to prepare to testify , and that he only learned on Friday of the identities of the two women relating to the charges .
Harvey Weinstein was arraigned on rape and other charges ( AP/Bebeto Matthews ) More
A statement issued on behalf of Weinstein 's lawyer Benjamin Brafman said : “ After being unfairly denied access to critical information about this case that was needed to defend him before the grand jury , Mr Weinstein 's attorneys decided that there was not sufficient time to properly prepare Mr Weinstein .
“ The identities of the accusers and the specific charges were provided to Mr Weinstein last Friday on the eve of the Memorial Day weekend and a deadline for his appearance set for Wednesday , 2pm .
“ Our request for a postponement of his appearance before the grand jury was denied .
“ Accordingly , Mr Brafman will inform the District Attorney today that Mr Weinstein intends to follow the advice of his attorneys and not testify before the grand jury . ”
The statement continued : “ Not having access to these materials is particularly troubling in this case , where one of the unsupported allegations is more than 14 years old and the rape allegation involves a woman with whom Mr Weinstein shared a 10-year consensual sexual relationship that continued for years after the alleged incident in 2013 .
“ Finally , Mr Weinstein 's attorneys noted that regardless of how compelling Mr Weinstein 's personal testimony might be , an indictment was inevitable due to the unfair political pressure being placed on Cy Vance to secure a conviction of Mr Weinstein . ”
Weinstein , 66 , appeared in court on Friday in New York in his first public appearance since facing numerous allegations of sexual misconduct .
He posted a one million dollar ( £751,060 ) cash bail and agreed to wear an electronic monitor which tracks his movements 24 hours a day , seven days a week .
He also surrendered his passport and agreed to stay within the states of New York and Connecticut .
Weinstein , who has repeatedly denied allegations of non-consensual sex , intends to plead not guilty to the charges , Mr Brafman said outside court .

As rescue teams are weighing options on how to take the 13 survivors out of Tham Luang cave , outgoing Chiang Rai Governor Narongsak Osotthanakorn today floated the possibility of the boys being extracted one at a time as it would be difficult for them to be brought out together at the same time .
He said the extraction plan is being adjusted because there would be difficulty bringing all the 12 young footballers and their coach out simultaneously even if they are physically healthy . The scenario is apparently based on the assumption that they may have to dive their way out of the flooded cave .

Source : Draw inspiration from liberation struggle : Tsvangirai – NewsDay Zimbabwe August 14 , 2017
MDC-T leader , Morgan Tsvangirai yesterday urged Zimbabweans to draw inspiration from the success of the liberation struggle , which ended at independence in 1980 and use it to fight the Zanu PF regime at next year 's general elections .
BY PAIDAMOYO MUZULU
In a message to mark Heroes Day commemorations , Tsvangirai said the Zanu PF government has failed to uphold the virtues of the liberation struggle , where thousands paid the ultimate price with their lives , hence , the call for a change of government .
“ There is , therefore , no longer any difference between the oppressive regime that we fought in an armed struggle and the supposed people 's government that came after it . In the words of George Orwell 's Animal Farm , we look from pig to man and from man to pig and we can not tell which is which ! ” he said .
Tsvangirai said Zimbabweans should use next year 's general elections to live to the liberation war ideals , more importantly , the right to vote .
“ On the eve of next year 's watershed election , we must ensure that the right to vote is secure and that , as a people , we turn out in our huge numbers to exercise that sacred right for which many Zimbabweans died . ”
The Lovemore Madhuku-led National Constitutional Assembly ( NCA ) also urged the electorate to use the opportunity provided by the elections to push out President Robert Mugabe 's government .
“ As we celebrate Heroes Day , NCA would like to remind all Zimbabweans that there is need for us , as a nation , to revisit the issue of the new undemocratic Constitution written by the inclusive government and supported by an unprincipled civil society , ” NCA said .
“ As NCA , we urge Zimbabweans that , as we get closer to next year general election , we should prepare ourselves to vote for a government that reflects our views and aspirations . ”
HUNTSVILLE , Ala. - Alabama Democrats see Tuesday 's special Senate election as a chance to renounce a history littered with politicians whose race-baiting , bombast and other baggage have long soiled the state 's reputation beyond its borders .
Many Republicans see the vote as chance to ratify their conservative values and protect President Donald Trump 's agenda ahead of the 2018 midterm elections .
At the center are Republican Roy Moore , a former jurist twice removed as state chief justice and now accused of sexual misconduct with teenage girls decades ago , and Democrat Doug Jones , an erstwhile federal prosecutor best known for prosecuting two Ku Klux Klansmen responsible for killing four black girls in the 1963 bombing of Birmingham 's 16th Street Baptist Church .
The winner will take the seat held previously by Trump 's attorney general , Jeff Sessions . Republicans control the Senate with 52 seats .
In truth , the matchup mixes both Alabama 's tortured history and the nation 's current divisive , bitterly partisan politics , and it has made a spectacle of a Deep South state well acquainted with national scrutiny but not accustomed to competitive general elections .
`` This is an election to tell the whole world what we stand for , '' Jones told supporters at one stop Sunday , adding that his campaign `` is on the right side of history . '' At an earlier appearance , he declared Alabama is `` at a crossroads '' and that Moore , an unapologetic evangelical populist , tries only to `` create conflict and division . ''
Jones , 63 , stops short of explicitly comparing Moore to the four-term Gov . George Wallace , whose populism was rooted in segregation . But Jones alluded Sunday to that era of Alabama politics .
`` Elect a responsible man to a responsible office , '' Jones said , repeating the campaign slogan of another Alabama governor , Albert Brewer , who nearly defeated Wallace in 1970 in a contest Alabama liberals and many moderates still lament as a lost opportunity .

Some of Jones ' supporters put it even more bluntly . `` I thought Alabama 's image was pretty much at the bottom , '' said Pat Lawrence , a retired software engineer in Huntsville . A Moore win , Lawrence added , `` will be a whole new bottom . ''
Those concerns extend even to some GOP quarters . Alabama 's senior senator , Richard Shelby , confirmed Sunday that he did not vote for Moore , saying he wrote in another `` distinguished '' party figure he declined to name .
Yet for many Republicans , Moore is a paragon of traditional values . They reject accusations that he molested two teenage girls and pursued relationships with others decades ago . Moore denies the charges .
`` Everyone has to vote their convictions , '' said Kevin Mims of Montgomery , as he held his Bible outside his Baptist church Sunday in Montgomery . `` My conviction is he 's the right man for the job . ''
Where Moore 's critics see a state judge who defied federal courts , including the U.S. Supreme Court 's decision legalizing same-sex marriage , Mims sees a stalwart who stands `` on the word of God . '' Other conservatives see an anti-establishment firebrand in the mold of Trump , who won Alabama by 28 percentage points .
Moore encourages that view with fundraising emails that urge backers to help him `` defeat the elite , '' a swipe at both Democrats and the establishment Republicans who tried to deny him the GOP nomination earlier this year .
Ultimately , Republicans from Moore to Trump himself are betting on a simple bottom line : Most Alabama conservatives simply wo n't defect to a Democrat .
`` If Alabama elects liberal Democrat Doug Jones , all of our progress will be stopped cold , '' Trump says in a robocall the Moore campaign plans to push out Monday .
The president also invokes a common fear among Republicans , calling Jones `` a puppet of Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer , '' the Democratic House and Senate leaders in Washington , both of them reviled by conservative voters . `` Roy Moore is the guy we need to pass our Make American Great Again agenda , '' the president insists .
Moore 's baggage could make it difficult to draw conclusions about what the results might mean beyond Alabama , but both parties are watching closely .
Democrats need to flip 24 GOP-held seats to reclaim a House majority , and they 're trying to dent the slim Republican advantage in the Senate and its dominance of statehouses around the country . In many of those races , they 'll need the same thing Jones must get to win in Alabama : strong turnout among young and non-white voters , along with improved performance among suburban moderates .
A Jones victory would be hailed as a potential precursor , and Democrats have indicated they have a post-Alabama strategy even if Jones loses : They 'll take Alabama 's brand national , hammering Republicans as `` the party of Donald Trump and Roy Moore . ''
BEIJING ( Reuters ) - China will open up its economy further , and its door to the outside will only get wider , with foreign and domestic firms allowed to compete on an equal footing , Premier Li Keqiang said at the close the country 's annual parliament session on Tuesday .

The familiar-sounding pledges from Beijing came as the prospect of a global trade war loomed in the wake of U.S. President Donald Trump imposition of hefty import tariffs on steel and aluminum earlier this month .
By the end of this week , according to sources in Washington , the United States is expected to unveil new tariffs on up to $ 60 billion worth of Chinese technology and consumer goods annually , fulfilling Trump 's campaign promises to get tough on China and its trade practices .
“ I hope both China and the U.S. will act rationally , and not be led by emotions , and avoid a trade war , ” Li told reporters in a televised news conference at the Great Hall of the People in central Beijing .
China will improve access to its services and manufacturing sectors while further lowering import tariffs , including those on cancer-related drugs , Li also said at his once-a-year press conference . He did not give more specifics .
“ China 's economy has been so integrated with the world 's , that closing China 's door would mean blocking our way for development , ” Li said .
“ China 's aim is to ensure that both domestic and foreign firms , and companies under all kinds of ownership structure , will be able to compete on fair terms in China 's large market . ”
When President Xi Jinping 's top economic adviser Liu visited Washington recently , the Trump administration pressed him to find ways to reduce China 's $ 375 billion trade surplus with the United States .
“ We are unwilling to see a big trade deficit , not only with the U.S. , , ” Li said . “ We hope trade will be balanced . ”
In his remarks , Li said that as China widens access to its markets , there will be no forced transfers of technology , and China will better protect intellectual property rights .

Trump says Beijing has forced U.S. companies to transfer their intellectual property to China as a cost of doing business there , though China has insisted that technology transfers are not a condition of gaining market access .
A source who had direct knowledge of the Trump administration 's thinking told Reuters last week that the tariffs expected to be announced this week would chiefly target information technology , consumer electronics and telecoms and other products benefiting from U.S. intellectual property .
But they could be much broader and hit consumer products such as clothing and footwear , with a list eventually running to 100 products , this source said .
The U.S. currently restricts exports of items for military use to China , which could potentially cover a wide range of dual-use technology products .

The situation is also complicated by the fact that many Chinese firms are active in both civilian and military industries .
“ We hope the U.S. could ease restrictions on high-tech or high value-added product exports , ” Li said .
“ We will strictly protect intellectual property . We hope this important means for balancing China-U.S. trade will not be missed , otherwise we will lose a chance to make money . ”
Li said China was confident of achieving its 2018 economic targets . The government aims to expand its economy by around 6.5 percent this year , having easily surpassed the same target in 2017 .
China 's financial sector were in good shape and banks have enough provisions , Li said , adding that regulators would take “ resolute measures ” to tackle financial risks .
The Chinese central bank was being given responsibility for drafting important laws covering banking and insurance sector , with regulation over the $ 42 trillion sector becoming more streamlined and tighter .
Before the press conference , Li introduced China 's four new vice premiers , though they neither took questions nor spoke . Among them was Liu He , widely regarded as China 's new economic tsar .

In his inaugural speech , Cyril De Souza , assistant director , WTC , Goa , said that , past industrial revolution did lead to loss of jobs but the good and challenging part of it was that it also created new opportunities that covered up for the loss . He said , that previous industrial revolution also improved the standard of living , quality of life and medical care among others . Giving his views on the day 's theme he suggested that the fourth industrial revolution which is going to be digital based although destructive would create new avenues for investment and trade .
Speaker D Kumar Pillai , managing director , Oriyon Plastics and Packaging Products , spoke on the issue of artificial intelligence focusing on virtual assistants like Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant 's latest feature Google Duplex . He also discussed the pros and cons of the forth industrial revolution with the advent of artificial intelligence in various fields .
The World Trade Day is an international event that celebrates the significance of international trade in economic development and discusses the challenges for connecting SMEs to global markets . The event was at the EDC House .

A spinoff of “ The Middle ” could be coming to ABC .
The broadcaster is said to be developing a new series that would center around socially awkward Heck daughter Sue , played by Eden Sher . The news of the potential spinoff comes just over a week after “ The Middle ” aired its series finale after nine seasons , though there were rumblings that such a project could be in development that started earlier this year . In final season , Sue was in college studying hotel management . “ The Middle ” creators Eileen Heisler and DeAnn Heline are attached to the project , along with Warner Bros. TV , though deals for Heisler , Heline , and Sher are not yet final .
ABC declined to comment .
A spinoff of “ The Middle ” could help fill the hole in the fall schedule left by the cancellation of “ Roseanne. ” Both “ Roseanne ” and “ The Middle ” centered on Midwestern families trying to make ends meet . ABC was hoping to use “ Roseanne ” to launch the new fall family comedy “ The Kids Are Alright , ” as well as anchor its entire Tuesday night lineup . While “ The Middle ” never approached “ Roseanne ” numbers in the ratings , the show remained a stable performer for ABC throughout its run . The final season averaged a 1.4 in adults 18-49 and 6 million viewers per episode in Live+Same Day .
Should the project move forward , it would become the second comedy spinoff on ABC 's 2018-2019 schedule . The network previously ordered a spinoff of “ The Goldbergs ” titled “ Schooled , ” which will star Tim Meadows , Bryan Callen , and AJ Michalka and debut at midseason . ABC also currently airs “ Station 19 , ” a firefighter-centric spinoff of “ Grey 's Anatomy . ”

A brave second half display was the main reason behind Luton ending Town 's boss Nathan Jones ' ‘ pre-occupation ' over his side 's poor recent home form with a 3-1 victory over Barnet on Boxing Day .
The Hatters chief had seen his side win just one of their last six League Two matches at Kenilworth Road , but a strong start , plus a rare first half goal , with Alan Sheehan 's wonderful free kick breaking the monopoly of Danny Hylton and Cameron McGeehan goals since September 24 , made it 1-1 at the break .
I was delighted , as our home form has n't been a worry but little pre-occupation , and I thought we were excellent . Nathan Jones
In the second period , McGeehan was on target once more , before Alex Gilliead sealed a much-needed victory from range , as Jones said : “ It 's good to get a home win .
“ A lot was said about the Boxing Day performance and the failure at home , but I thought we were excellent at times .
“ We started well , we could have got something , then we got a goal from an excellent free kick .
“ Then they had a spell to be fair to them Barnet where they played and we did n't get to grips with that .
“ So probably at half time it was a fair result and then what we said was we just need to lift it , be braver in possession .
“ We 'd gone back to our favoured shape and I thought they were braver second half .
“ They got on it , we started really well , after 12 seconds could have scored . The goal that Jordan Cook scored is onside and we 've had that back , then he 's in again and he 's given offside , and he 's onside , so we could have had four early on .
“ After scoring again , I thought we saw out the game really , really professionally .
“ I was delighted , as our home form has n't been a worry but little pre-occupation , and I thought we were excellent . ”
One thing that Jones was n't overly enthused with was the performance of referee Mark Haywood after Bira Dembele 's goal was allowed to stand , despite the visiting defender appearing to clearly bundle the ball over the line with his arm .
There were a host other decisions queried too as the Hatters boss continued : “ There was a lot of appealing going on for handball so I do n't know .
“ I have seen it , I did n't see anything untoward , and I thought we could have defended from the throw-in better , which we 've worked on this week ironically , as we feel we have n't been as good from them .
“ If I 'm going to be ultra critical and I do n't want to get into trouble , I thought some of the decisions were strange to say the least .
“ I think he could have managed it better , some of the things he did n't give led to other stuff .
“ The free kick for Scott Cuthbert heading it back to the goalkeeper first half was utterly baffling . Then the way where James Justin runs across the pitch and he 's brought him down and that leads to Alex Gilliead 's booking ironically .
“ Just manage the game and I just felt he did n't do that . ”
HTC is back at E3 this year for its sophomore turn at the gaming expo , after its first show in 2016 following closely on the heels of the Vive VR headset 's consumer launch . I spoke to HTC VP of VR Dan O'Brien at this year 's E3 , to find out a bit about how the company sees the market , its role therein and the state of VR in general now that it 's not the newest kid on the block .
We talked a bit about how important it is to see big games embrace the platform , including Bethesda 's Doom and Fallout VR titles ( it was n't yet public that Mario Kart would also be making its way to the Vive via Tokyo arcades , but the same conclusions apply ) . O'Brien was candid about how despite strong indie support , which HTC continues to prize , big name games coming to VR are sure to help it continue to mature as an industry , and attract new gamers who might 've been content to otherwise stay sat on the fence .
The Vive has also evolved from a hardware perspective , and O'Brien pointed out that both the new Deluxe Audio Strap , and Intel 's upcoming WiGig wireless adapter kit for Vive are going to be on display and available for testing this year at the show . The Vive Tracker , which brings other objects into the gaming world , is likewise on display with some new game integrations . The headset itself may not have changed since last year , but we 've learned a lot about user experience , on both hardware and software fronts .
VR might not yet be a breakaway smash hit , even when it 's tied to a console and with a lower barrier to entry than the Vive , as with PS VR . But O'Brien does n't seem under any illusions about the work that still needs to be done in the space , and as proof he points to recent partnership announcements , including with Google , on different approaches to broadening the appeal of VR in general .
HTC did n't get have anything as grandiose as its own Vive keynote at its second E3 , necessarily , but it did see the VR pioneer incorporated in big announcements from Sony , Bethesda and Nintendo – not bad for a relative gaming expo novice .

Initial reports indicate that Sylvester was the victim of a road accident but no foul play is suspected to date .
A post mortem examination was conducted on the body by Dr. Heather Emmanuel last Saturday , which revealed that Sylvester died as a result of traumatic brain injury with global subarachnoid haemorrhage due to base of skull and right temporal bone fracture .
This incident brings to 10 the number of road fatalities recorded for the year 2017 .
Nick Cave is one of our greatest working live performers , but you might not expect his particular form of burning intensity to translate to late-night TV . That 's doubly true when you consider that Cave and his Bad Seeds are currently touring their stark , stunning , death-haunted Skeleton Tree album . And honestly , you 'd be right . In the band 's performance on Stephen Colbert 's Late Show last night , the band did n't go for burning intensity . Instead , Cave did his sort of lounge-lizard slam-poet thing , performing the Skeleton Tree track “ Rings Of Saturn. ” And it was still incredible . Things might get more real at a Bad Seeds show , but for a late-night performance from someone who does n't do them too often , you ca n't ask for anything better than this . Watch it below .
Skeleton Tree is out now on Bad Seed Ltd .
I always thought that when I eventually found the love of my life , they would be ... well , human . Sentient , even . But as Sheryl Crowe so wisely once sang , `` Every day is a winding road , '' and apparently mine has led me to true love in a most unegg-spected way ( sorry ) : with the Dash Rapid Egg Cooker on Amazon that everyone has been freaking out over for the past few months .
You see , I was once an ordinary mortal . I boiled water and dumped a dozen eggs in there on Sundays , crossed my fingers , and prayed to whatever meal prepping gods Gwyneth Paltrow descended from that they would cook to a precisely medium-ish boil , because apparently my mouth is very bougie about the consistency of my eggs . I got perfect eggs maybe 50 percent of the time , but 50 percent is not the kind of life I want to lead . Not for me , or for my egg-eating brethren , or for my future egg-eating children .
Enter : the egg cooker that changed my life and redefined the meaning of love . Odds are you have seen this contraption making the rounds ; it 's been written up by other egg stans on other websites multiple times since it first crossed my eyes in a Mashable article in December . It 's affordable , at $ 19.99 a pop , but even more affordable considering everything it 's capable of — it has the capacity to soft , medium , and hard boil six eggs at once , and can also poach , scramble , or make omelettes . Literally all you have to do is find an egg , pour some water into the egg cooker , and let 'er rip .
Rapid Dash Egg Cooker , $ 19.99 , Amazon
I bought it on a whim around Christmas of last year , and ever since I started using it I have not been able to shut the heck up about it . My coworkers have purchased them . My coworkers have gifted them to their significant others . So life-changing is this egg cooker , that I sent one to my parents ' house so they could bask in its glory , too .
The reason I personally am so obsessed with it is that it takes about seven minutes for eggs to boil , and the measuring tool they give you is so precise that you never have to worry about how your eggs are going to turn out — the measuring cup shows you exactly how much water to put in depending on the kind of boil you want , and it has yet to disappoint . Every now and then you 'll get an egg with a slightly weaker shell and it 'll crack and leak some egg out , but it 's a fairly rare occurrence ( and even when it does happen , cleanup is super easy , since it tends to cook and harden even when it `` leaks '' ) .
The upside of the egg cooker , though , is also its downside : your eggs never overcook because it turns itself off automatically . But when it does that , it lets out the most unholy wail you will ever hear in this or any of your other nine lives . If you can handle that , though , it 's well worth the mental `` AGHAKGJADFKLGJADFGJ ! '' you get every time the timer goes off to enjoy some sweet , sweet , lazily cooked egg .
Other people I 've talked to that I 've either forced this machine onto or happened to own it themselves also enjoy it because it can steam other foods for you , like vegetables and fish . This is far too advanced for my liking , but the egg cooker comes with instructions for how to attempt it yourself .
Other uses for your egg cooker include , but are not limited to :
Reenacting the scene from Call Me By Your Name where Armie Hammer butchers the living bejeezus out of a soft-boiled egg
Reenacting the scene from Shape of Water where Sally Fields engages in barely veiled foreplay with a sea monster using hard-boiled eggs
Wondering why two critically-acclaimed , award-winning movies in 2017 felt the need to sexualize eggs , while consuming your own eggs
Bringing cooked eggs to your therapist after you realize you are now , in fact , hung up on eggs in a Real Weird Way
And so much more !
And apparently , if six eggs are TOO FEW for your and your egg-static heart , apparently there is now a version that cooks 12 eggs at once . I ca n't vouch for this as I 've never tried it and am personally not convinced human beings deserve this kind of power , but here it is , if you want to risk flying too close to the sun .

Anyway , all this is to say , I now eat two to three eggs a day on the reg , my skin is clear ( ish ) , my crops are thriving , and if I eventually turn into an egg I will walk away from human life without so much as a wistful glance back . Life is eggsquisite .
KASUR-It seems dacoits rule the roost in Kasur district despite tall claims of the police regarding success against the outlaws .
The report of a survey conducted by The Nation reveals that dacoits have been carrying out their criminal activities without let or hindrance across the district . In fact the police incapability to deal with the outlaws has made them bold to conduct robberies even in broad daylight . Citizens , on the other hand , have been restricted to their houses as the robbers rule the roost . The trading community is the worst victim of dacoity incidents as there is no market left in the city where the traders have not been threatened or robbed .
The recent robbery with Kasur Press Club Haji Sharif Mehr , exposed the police incapability to overcome the crime . During the robbery attempt , the cops remained hidden in their vehicle instead of securing him from dacoits ' attack . The incident sparked panic among citizens as now they consider themselves more vulnerable to the robbery attempts .
According to residents of different localities of the Kasur city , they have submitted numerous complaints regarding rising robbery incidents and the cops ' reluctance to go after criminals . `` But the police high-ups have turned a deaf ear to the public woes , '' they regretted . `` The police claim to have many dacoits killed in shootouts but the robberies are on the rise with each passing day , '' they questioned .
Citizens demanded Punjab Chief Minister Shehbaz Sharif to look into the matter and take stern action against black sheep in the police department who , they said , left the public on the mercy of dacoits .
MOTORCYCLIST KILLED
A man was killed in collision between a motorcycle and van . According to the Chunian Police , Amir was travelling on Changa Manga Road on a motorbike when he collided with a Sheikhupura-bound van . Resultantly , he was killed on the spot .
SALESMAN ROBBED
A salesman was robbed of cash and a cellphone near Phoolnagar Bypass . Abdul Haseeb was on the way back after the sale of bread in Kasur on a pickup van . As he reached near Phoolnagar Bypass , two unidentified dacoits intercepted the van and snatched Rs50,000 and cellphone from him .

SURPRISE , Ariz. — The Texas Rangers have claimed first baseman Tommy Joseph off waivers from the Philadelphia Phillies .
The Rangers made the move Monday , a week after the Phillies designated him for assignment when they signed free agent pitcher Jake Arrieta .
The 26-year-old Joseph hit over 20 home runs in each of his two seasons in the majors . He batted .240 with 22 homers and 69 RBIs while starting 125 times at first last year .
Philadelphia signed power-hitting free agent Carlos Santana to play first this season .
Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf ( PTI ) Chairman Imran Khan on Monday said Chief of Army Staff General Qamar Bajwa expressed his support for democracy .
Imran was referring to a meeting between him and General Bajwa , the details of which were not disclosed to media and the general public , which took place on April 1 .
“ He ( General Bajwa ) clearly said that he supports democracy . He also said that as an institution the army supports free and fair elections , ” the PTI chief said in a talk show .
Imran said he had conveyed to the Army chief his party wo n't let the 2018 elections get rigged as the same happened in 2013 . “ I told General Bajwa that free and fair elections are a cornerstone of democracy , ” he added .
The PTI chief said that he also discussed Pakistan-Afghanistan border tensions and the merger of Federally Administered Tribal Areas ( Fata ) and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa with the Army chief .
“ Both the issues are directly affecting KP and after the closure of the border by the Army , I thought it was important to discuss the issue with General Bajwa , ” he added .

Special Assistant to Prime Minister on Revenue Haroon Akhtar Khan has said that it is the endeavour of government to spur growth in the manufacturing sector and is willing to work with the business sector to strengthen the manufacturing sector through a realistic and consensus-based plan of action based on viable proposals advanced by the business community .
“ The government believes in facilitating the business community by providing them a level-playing field and an investment-friendly environment , ” he said while talking to a delegation of Pakistan Business Council led by Council founder Ali Habib and Chairman Ahsan Malik . Member IR Policy FBR Dr. Muhammad Iqbal and other senior FBR officials were also present .
The delegation briefed the Special Assistant to Prime Minister on Revenue on the issues and concerns of the business community with particular focus on challenges facing the manufacturing sector and presented a set of proposals and recommendations for their solution .
Haroon reiterated that the government was keen to work with the business community and requested the Pakistan Business Council to prepare a comprehensive and realistic plan of action for the resolution of issues facing the manufacturing and other associated sector . “ The government has for the past four a half years taken a number of initiatives in the regard and we would welcome any suggestion and input from the relevant stakeholders to further consolidate our efforts to strengthen the manufacturing base , ” he said .
OnePlus 's new flagship shines with Android 7.0 — a phone that 's almost as good as the Pixel for a whole lot less cash .
I have a confession to make : I 've had a OnePlus 3T for the past month or so , but for most of that time it 's been collecting dust on my desk . The main reason for that has been software ; I 've been spoiled by phones like the Google Pixel and Huawei Mate 9 , which have shipped with the new Android 7.0 Nougat , while the 3T arrived running the increasingly dated Marshmallow .
The new version of Android is , in essence , a collection of smaller upgrades which combine to form an experience greater than the sum of its parts . In a phone that I 'm going to use as a daily driver , a lot of this has to do with information density — I much , much prefer Nougat 's more compact , bundled notifications , and the ability to scale the entire UI to a size of my choosing , letting me see more on screen . Then there are added features like split-screen multi-window , which I do n't use every day , but are immensely useful on phones with larger displays .
And the lack of all this stuff was what made using the 3T really difficult for me — until now .
OnePlus left it until the very last possible moment before starting to roll out Nougat for the OnePlus 3T and its predecessor , the 3 . The update promised `` by the end of the year '' landed in the afternoon ( UTC ) of December 31 , just hours after the company ( bizarrely ) released the first 3T Nougat beta build on its forums . But whatever — just over a month on from release , the 3T has the software experience it felt like it was supposed to ship with .
If you passed on the 3T at launch because it shipped with Marshmallow , now 's the time to take another look .
The update to Nougat is important to OnePlus 's core customer base of phone nerds . ( If you 're reading an article like this on Android Central , chances are that 's you . ) It also highlights the 3T 's place a top-tier competitor to the Google Pixel — a product which has left some fans of the more affordable Nexus series feeling excluded . As much as OnePlus sometimes says pricing is secondary , all of its phones have , in some way , been defined by their cost . The 3 and 3T both delivered superb value to begin with . Now , the arrival of Nougat augments a package which , at its peak 128GB configuration , is still $ 290 cheaper than a 32GB Pixel XL .
And although it 's based upon Android 7.0 at present , not the newer 7.1.1 release , OnePlus 's OxygenOS 4.0 has all the important headline features in place , bringing with it performance and battery life to match the Pixel XL . Sure , the Pixel will always get new updates first , but in the meantime , the two are on similar footing . ( The extra padding on the Pixel 's price tag gets you unlimited photo storage , Google Assistant , live support and other Googly bits that you may or may not feel are worth it . )
Meanwhile , changes to OxygenOS itself — many of them small and cosmetic in nature — bring some needed polish to the experience .
We 've already named the Pixel the best Android phone overall , and software updates for other devices wo n't change that — mainly the because of the excellent Pixel camera , and the fact that it 'll always be first with new stuff from Mountain View . But let 's face it , $ 769 is a lot of dough . If you 're not inclined to splash that much cash on a new phone ( or , hell , even if you are ) , the OnePlus 3T is a compelling rival — and more tempting than ever thanks to its latest update .

PACHU MENON , MARGAO
THE ‘ Jana Gana Mana , Noman Tuka Goenkara ' tour of the Congress leaders through all the 40 constituencies to highlight the BJP-led government 's failures in the state is giving an opportunity for the Congress to reestablish contacts with the ‘ aam aadmi ' and understand their problems . In the haste to set developmental milestones , the Congress is well aware that when it comes to the issues that assail Goans vis-à-vis their day-to-day sustenance , the present dispensation has been unsuccessful in effectively addressing them . There are so many fields where the contribution of the government has been found wanting , and the problems requiring a political will to resolve them continue to linger on . Quite unlike the manner in which politicians have efficiently made use of the social media to woo the urban electorate , one-to-one contact with voters still continues to be the best way to endear themselves to those from the remotest corners of the state . Many claim that it was only by mingling with people and taking the party 's election campaign to the doorstep of each and every house that Chief Minister Manohar Parrikar could ensure a landslide victory for the BJP in 2012 assembly elections . With approachability and accessibility being the key words for building up confidence amongst locals , the rapport thus created should pay rich dividends for parties in ensuing elections . In this respect , the tour of constituencies undertaken by Congress leaders is a promotional campaign more than anything else . As a strategy this could not have come at a better time ! In the meanwhile , the state unit of the BJP has decided to hold ‘ Jan Sampark Abhiyan ' across the state to mark completion of four years of BJP-led government at the Centre . But having come so closely on the heels of the Congress ' ‘ yatra ' , which has been receiving an overwhelming public response , the decision does give indications of the BJP 's wariness over the whole exercise . However , having overcome its reticence to take the ruling to task over many of its inconsistencies , the Congress in Goa does give suggestions of a revitalised party !
The long lineup of vans , cars and SUVs idling in front of schools every morning and afternoon speaks to a chronic problem .
For years , school and community groups have tried , with limited success , to have more kids walk , cycle or take public transit to school , instead of being driven by mom or dad .
But now , two Western University researchers have started a two-year study on how to turn the trend around with the help of a $ 197,550 grant from Ontario 's Environment Ministry .
Jason Gilliland and Andrew Clark , will be running the Active and Safe Routes to School program through Western 's Human Environments Analysis Laboratory .
They will study 12 London-area public and Catholic schools to determine ways to remove barriers , change habits and come up with school travel plans to encourage more kids to walk , cycle or take public transit to school .
Gilliland said it is believed to be the most rigorous project in Canada on the issue .
While school boards and council and health officials have worked at the problem for years , and set up programs such as Walking School Bus , much of the work has been done by volunteers rather than research professionals .
Clark said the issue is complex and involves perceptions of safety , personal fitness , concern for the environment and busy schedules .
“ You have to take a multi-pronged approach . Changing parents ' perceptions and kid 's behaviour is difficult , because they are set in their routines , ” said Clark .
The researchers are surveying a range of schools — urban , suburban , small town — in high- and low- income areas .
School boards do n't bus elementary pupils who live less than 1.6 km from a school , or 3.2 km for high schoolers .
Studies show about 75 per cent of kids sometimes walk to school , but much fewer walk all the time . Students are more likely to walk home from school than walk to school , and boys are 1.5 times more likely to walk than girls .
In some cases , there are physical barriers , such as lack of sidewalks or snow removal . In other cases , education programs can deal with concerns about safety .
But the solutions have to be tailored to individual schools .
“ What we do n't know is what interventions will be effective in a specific school environment , ” said Gilliland .
The schools in the study have a total enrolment of 5,000 to 6,000 and the program aims to boost the number of students walking , cycling or taking public transit by 10 per cent
Gilliland said even a 10 per cent change can benefit the environment . An environmental study of school parking lots showed air pollution levels spiked dramatically in areas where vehicles were idling .
Ontario Environment Minister Chris Ballard hopes professional academic research will provide some solid answers .
“ This is going a deeper dive into people 's concerns and how they might be motivated to change their behaviour . What is really stopping them having their kids walk , cycle or take public transit ? ”

Democrats Ca n't Turn States Blue Without Black Voters
By Jeffrey L. Boney
( NNPA Newswire Contributor )
This November , all 435 seats in the United States House of Representatives and 35 of the 100 seats in the U.S. Senate will be up for grabs , making this one of the most crucial midterm elections in recent memory . Thirty-three of the 100 seats in the Senate will be regular elections , while the other two seats will be special elections , where the winner will serve a six-year term from January 3 , 2019 , to January 3 , 2025 .
If Democrats can successfully flip 23 Republican-held House seats , while holding on to all their current seats , they will take back the House in 2018 . Things are a lot closer in the U.S. Senate ; Democrats only have to successfully flip two Senate seats to take the Senate back .
Every major election cycle there are always discussions about turning battleground states that have traditionally been “ red states ” into “ blue states . ”
Here in the U.S. , a state is referred to as a “ red state ” or “ blue state ” depending on the party that those voters in that state traditionally choose during elections . If the majority of voters consistently choose the Republican Party , then that state is deemed a “ red state , ” whereas if the majority of voters consistently choose the Democratic Party , it is considered a “ blue state . ”
For Democrats to turn traditional “ red states ” into “ blue states ” in November , they will need increased voter registration and strong voter turnout in the Black community to make that happen . Focusing on these two important factors could effectively flip battleground states like Texas , Nevada , Tennessee , Utah , Arizona , Mississippi , and others from ‘ red states ' to ‘ blue states ' . More importantly , there are 39 gubernatorial elections and many other local , county and statewide races that will also be impacted by this 2018 election .
While there are many U.S. House and Senate races that already have a clear-cut favorite before the race even begins , there are many other races in battleground states that could significantly change the overall look of Congress .
Take the state of Texas for example .
U.S . Congressman Beto O'Rourke ( D-Texas ) has become a formidable opponent in his extremely competitive race to unseat Republican incumbent U.S . Senator Ted Cruz in November . According to a recent Quinnipiac University poll that was conducted in mid-April , the Senate race shows O'Rourke trailing Cruz by only three percentage points , which is well within the margin of error . O'Rourke is also beating Cruz on the fundraising end , hauling in a reported $ 6.7 million in the first quarter of 2018 alone .
A win by O'Rourke would completely change the political dynamics in the state of Texas and would energize the Democratic Party in other states across the nation .
Currently , Republicans have control of both the House and Senate in the Texas state legislature , as well as control of all the statewide offices , making Texas one of the most influential and consistently dominating ‘ red states ' in the U.S .
The last time voters in the state of Texas got behind a Democratic candidate for president was back in 1976 when Jimmy Carter defeated Republican Gerald Ford . Since that time , Texas voters have overwhelmingly supported the Republican candidate for president .
The same thing has happened relative to the governorship in Texas and all other statewide races ; Democratic Governor Ann Richards lost her bid for re-election against Republican George W. Bush in 1994 . Prior to her loss , Democrats had controlled the governorship for all but eight out of 120 of the prior years . No Democrat has won the governorship since , and the other statewide races have experienced the same results .
The only way to change these outcomes in Texas and other battleground states is to properly engage and mobilize Black voters . The National Newspaper Publishers Association ( NNPA ) , which is a trade group that represents over 200 Black-owned media companies across the U.S. , recently launched an initiative to register 5 million new , Black voters before the midterm elections , with the hopes of turning many of these traditionally “ red states ” into “ blue states ” in November .
However , the Democratic Party must engage and motivate this strong and loyal voting bloc of Black voters to make this a reality as well .
According to the Pew Research Center , 87 percent of Black voters identify with the Democratic Party or lean Democratic , with Black women being the driving force behind this high percentage of Black registered voters .
In Texas , many statewide Democratic candidates failed to invest significant financial resources during the March Democratic Primary or the May run-off election with Black media outlets , such as newspapers , radio or cable stations such as BET , OWN or TV ONE , to introduce themselves to these committed Black voters and share their policy positions and commitments . Failing to invest in Black voter outreach could end up costing some Democratic candidates the election .
The Beto O'Rourke campaign did , however , just make a major commitment to Black media outlets in Harris County to do Black voter outreach across Harris County starting in mid-May and continuing through November . The campaign stated that they plan to invest more in Black media and expressly stated that they know they can not win in Texas without the Black vote .
According to Carroll G. Robinson , an associate professor at Barbara Jordan-Mickey Leland School of Public Affairs at Texas Southern University and the former General Counsel of the Texas Democratic Party , in order to generate strong Black voter turnout and to increase awareness about the midterm elections in November , the Democratic Party and candidates like Beto O'Rourke are going to have to make a significant investment with Black media outlets to get their message out .
“ Black voters , like many other voters , are going to need more than just being against Trump to turnout in record numbers in November , ” Robinson said . “ Black voters must know that their issues and concerns are being addressed and that they , their communities and the candidates of their choice are being respected , included and invested in . ”

DUBLIN ( Reuters ) - The agent at the centre of an alleged scheme to illegally pass Ireland 's tickets for the 2016 Rio Olympics to touts was `` not genuine '' and was used to hide the involvement of banned ticket reseller THG , a Irish government report said on Monday .
The Olympic movement was rocked during the Rio Games when Europe 's top official , head of the Olympic Council of Ireland ( OCI ) Patrick Hickey , was arrested in a dawn raid on a luxury beachfront hotel by police investigating the alleged scheme .
Police in Brazil accuse Hickey of operating the ring with Dublin-based PRO10 Sports Management to funnel tickets intended for use by the Irish Olympic committee , and not authorised for resale , to international sports hospitality company THG Sports .
Hickey was released on bail in December . All involved deny wrongdoing .
A report commissioned by the Irish government in the wake of the scandal said on Monday it believed that PRO10 was effectively a front for THG , which had been banned by the organisers of the Rio Games .
`` It appears that Pro10 was not a genuine Authorised Ticket Reseller ( ATR ) but its involvement disguised the continuing role of THG and Marcus Evans as the real or de facto ATR , '' Judge Carroll Moran said in the report .
Evans is a British businessman whose namesake company controls THG .
The report cites Hickey 's personal assistant Linda O'Reilly , as saying it `` would appear that PRO10 was effectively a front or cover to allow Marcus Evans and THG to remain in the picture . ''
THG said in a statement it was satisfied that , at all times , it had `` acted lawfully in connection with the Rio Olympics , or any Olympics , '' but declined further comment .
Hickey , 72 , said in a statement he had received legal advice not to cooperate with the report in order to avoid prejudicing himself in relation to the criminal investigation in Brazil , but said the report contained `` significant inaccuracies . ''
He added that he was `` totally confident '' he would be cleared of all charges .
Hickey 's replacement as OCI president , Sarah Keane , told journalists the report `` did not make easy reading '' but that it neither confirmed nor refuted the possibility that criminal activity took place .
THG REJECTED
THG had been Ireland 's official reseller of tickets for the Olympics in London in 2012 and at Sochi in 2014 .
But the Rio Organising Committee rejected the application of THG to act as reseller for the 2016 Summer Games , saying the fact it was already offering hospitality packages in Brazil breached its rules .
Police last year said they had uncovered emails between Hickey and Evans in which the pair discussed tickets , which police said the ring planned to sell at inflated prices and earn as much as 10 million reais ( 2.42 million pounds ) in profit .
Reuters could not independently verify the authenticity of the emails .
Monday 's report noted that THG paid $ 1 million ( 771,247.88 pounds ) to be appointed as Ireland 's ticket reseller for the Olympic Games in London in 2012 and at Sochi in 2014 `` without an explanation being given at the time as to how it would recoup this sum or earn a return on such a large outlay . ''
The report was highly critical of the service provided by PRO10 , particularly to the friends and family of athletes , saying it was `` inadequate and chaotic '' and that PRO10 's services were `` unfit for purpose '' .
The judge said the refusal of THG , PRO10 and Hickey to participate in the preparation of the report was a `` major impediment '' to its work .
On Monday , the OCI 's Keane said a contract was signed with THG to retain its services until the 2026 Winter Olympics and that it was possible THG would take legal action to enforce it .
The organising committee of the 2018 Pyeongchang Winter Games in Korea had rejected THG as Ireland 's authorised ticket seller , she added .
Ireland has been unable to find sponsors for the 2018 Games and will have to fund uniforms from its own resources , she said .

LOS ANGELES ( AP )  A tennis commentator dropped by ESPN for a remark about Venus Williams during the Australian Open sued the sports network Tuesday for wrongful termination .
Former tennis pro Doug Adler maintains he was describing Williams ' aggressive style last month as `` guerrilla '' tactics and not comparing her with a `` gorilla . ''
He apologized for his poor word choice but was let go from ESPN mid-tournament .
Adler claims `` emotional distress '' in the filing in Los Angeles Superior Court , alleging he was wrongly branded a racist and has lost other TV opportunities because of the controversy .

The lawsuit calls for punitive financial damages , but does n't name an amount .
ESPN spokesman Mike Soltys said Tuesday the network had n't seen the lawsuit and had no comment .
The suit points out that `` Guerrilla Tennis '' was the name of a Nike TV ad from the 1990s featuring Andre Agassi and Pete Sampras .
`` Obviously , ( Adler ) saw that commercial many times and the phrase became widely used by those who actually understood tennis vernacular and followed the sport closely , '' the lawsuit said .
Peter Bodo , senior editor of Tennis magazine , used the term in a 2012 profile of Agnieszka Radwanska , according to court papers .
Adler was doing play-by-play commentary on ESPN for Williams ' Jan. 18 match against Stefanie Voegele , saying Williams was playing more aggressively after Voegele missed serves . When Voegele faulted on a serve , Adler described Williams as moving in and charging with a `` gorilla effect '' or `` guerrilla effect . '' Because the words gorilla and guerrilla are pronounced similarly , it 's impossible to say for certain which word Adler spoke .
Offended viewers called for Adler to be fired for comparing Williams , who is African-American , with a gorilla .
At the time Adler said he was speaking about Williams ' tactics and strategy and `` simply and inadvertently chose the wrong word to describe her play . ''
In a statement emailed in January to The Associated Press , ESPN said it had pulled Adler from broadcasts .
`` During an Australian Open stream on ESPN3 , Doug Adler should have been more careful in his word selection . He apologized and we have removed him from his remaining assignments , '' the statement read .
Adler was an All-American player at the University of Southern California who went on to play on the pro circuit . He was hired by ESPN in 2008 and covered tournaments including the U.S. Open , French Open and Wimbledon
Williams declined to comment on the remark or the ensuing controversy .

Denver Taste of Ethiopia Festival Features Food , Culture and Role Models

Taste of Ethiopia brings together food , culture and role models in the immigrant community
Denver is n't in the dark about Ethiopian food .
In some cities , Ethiopian cuisines are a niche market for adventurous foodies . But Colorado has become a hub for African-inspired restaurants serving the country 's famous spicy-sour mix of injera bread and stews .
That why for the last five years , thousands of locals have flocked to the annual Taste of Ethiopia…
The food is n't the only thing that draws people to the festival and keeps them coming back . The rich culture does as well .
“ We 're bringing the community and culture to those who have left Ethiopia and it 's our way of passing our heritage to the next generation of kids who are born here in American society , ” said . Neb Asfaw . “ We want to preserve our heritage and also bring it to the local community . ”
Most important to the festival and the Ethiopian community was to take the time to honor model citizens who are involved with and supporting the immigrant community .
Investment manager and business owner Mel Tewahade said he moved to the U.S. from Ethiopia 35 years ago with little more than $ 20 in his pocket .
“ I help people in the community to get acclimated to American way of life and adjusting to cultural differences , ” Tewahade said . “ Making life easier for newcomers . How should they dress themselves and cut their nails and present themselves to have opportunity in labor market .
Tewhade said he sees a lack of role models in the black community and is trying to fill that void .

Russian intelligence officials made repeated contact with members of President Trump 's campaign staff , according to new reports that cite anonymous U.S. officials . American agencies were concerned about the contacts but have n't seen proof of collusion between the campaign and the Russian security apparatus , the reports say .
Law enforcement and intelligence agencies intercepted the calls at the same time as they investigated Russia 's attempts to tamper with the presidential election , according to The New York Times , which first reported the contacts .
According to CNN , `` The communications were intercepted during routine intelligence collection targeting Russian officials and other Russian nationals known to U.S . intelligence . ''
Both CNN and the Times cite multiple current and former U.S. officials as the sources for their stories .
Reporter Matt Apuzzo , part of the Times team that broke the story , tells NPR 's Morning Edition that while officials said they have n't seen proof of collusion — `` just the flurry of contacts was enough , and the timing of the contacts , was enough to get them very concerned . ''
U.S. agencies are still working to determine the reasons behind the contacts , officials tell both news outlets .
President Trump called the reports `` conspiracy theories '' early Wednesday , in response to the stories :
`` The fake news media is going crazy with their conspiracy theories and blind hatred , '' the president wrote . He then added that MSNBC and CNN are `` unwatchable , '' while the Fox News program Fox & Friends `` is great . ''
The Kremlin had a similar response , with Russian Presidential Spokesman Dmitry Peskov saying , `` Let us not believe in what media say , for nowadays it is very difficult to tell actual news from fake ones . ''
That 's according to state-run Tass media , which adds that Peskov also criticized the use of anonymous sources by the media .
Allegations about Trump 's involvement with Russia have ranged from reports last month of a dossier that alleged collusion between the then-candidate and Russian President Vladimir Putin to a public call from the candidate himself last July , when he urged Russian agents to `` find '' Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton 's emails and release them .
The FBI has been investigating contacts between Trump aides and Russia ; in Congress , there are also calls for public investigations . Last month , the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence announced it would investigate allegations that Russia meddled in the U.S. elections .
But there is resistance among Republicans in Congress to go after one of their own , particularly as the new president is settling into the White House .
Republican Rep. Mike Johnson of Louisiana , who 's on the House Judiciary Committee , tells Morning Edition , `` I do n't think we need an independent investigation here , I think we need to let the Intelligence and the Judiciary committees do their work . ''
That work , he said , includes receiving classified briefings about the new allegations . Johnson also raised questions about leaks in the government — particularly of information that 's drawn from surveillance that swept up the communications of U.S. citizens .
`` There are some serious legal implications here , '' Johnson said , `` but it has nothing to do with partisan politics . I mean , the leak of highly classified information by what is apparent here — a number of individuals inside our intelligence community — is the illegal act that I think we need to review . ''
Johnson also faulted intelligence agencies for not doing more to protect the identity of Americans — such as former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn — whose communications with a foreign national were monitored .
New reports of contacts between the Trump campaign and Russia follow the exit of a third member of Donald Trump 's inner circle in the past 12 months amid allegations of inappropriate contact with the country :
Michael Flynn resigned as national security adviser this week over the handling of his contacts with Russia 's ambassador to the U.S. ;
Paul Manafort , resigned as Trump 's campaign chairman last August amid reports of his attempts to align Trump 's policies with Russian interests ;
Carter Page removed himself as a foreign policy adviser last September , as reports emerged about a visit to Russia and other potential contacts .
Manafort and Flynn were among the senior Trump team members who were `` regularly communicating with Russian nationals , '' CNN reports .
In an interview with the Times , Manafort called the officials ' account `` absurd '' and said he had never had anything to do with Putin 's government .
Manafort told the newspaper , `` It 's not like these people wear badges that say , ' I 'm a Russian intelligence officer . ' ''

Barça looked set for a third consecutive league draw as they created scant opportunities but they were presented with the advantage of an extra man when Villarreal midfielder Daniel Raba was given a straight red card for a wild , studs-up challenge on Sergio Busquets on the hour mark .
Barça did not take long to cash in and Suarez broke the deadlock in the 72nd minute , rounding goalkeeper Sergio Asenjo to complete a move of quick passes by Messi , Jordi Alba and substitute Paco Alcacer .
The visitors stretched their lead 11 minutes later with the help of a haphazard backpass from Victor Ruiz to Busquets , who played in Messi for his 14th league goal this campaign .
Barça leads the standings on 39 points , five clear of second-placed Valencia and six ahead of Atletico in third , while champions Real Madrid are fourth on 31 .
Villarreal coach Javi Calleja said the red card was unfair on his side .
“ We were playing well and managing the periods of the game but everything changed with the red card , ” he told reporters .
“ From the sidelines it did n't look like a red card and I ‘ m certain that if it had been the other way round it would n't have been a sending off . Raba has been punished for being a young guy . ”
Barça coach Valverde said the red card was fair and praised his side for taking advantage .

“ It looked a strong challenge to me and I think the player ( Raba ) realised it was an excessive challenge . The player was shocked and did n't protest , ” he said .
“ They were well positioned and closed down all the spaces . They were dangerous on the counter , it was a game that could have gone uphill for us but we got the job done . ”
Earlier , a goal by Saul Niguez racked up a third straight victory in La Liga for Atletico , who got an unconvincing win at Betis .

The Spanish midfielder slid in at the back post to meet a low cross from Sime Vrsaljko to score the only goal of the match in the 30th minute , netting for the second game in a row .
Atletico , who were eliminated from the Champions League on Tuesday after a 1-1 draw at Chelsea , were without talismanic forward Antoine Griezmann and had only two shots on target and 26 percent of possession .
Diego Simeone 's side survived a huge penalty appeal for a shove by Angel Correa on forward Cristian Tello shortly before Saul 's goal while Atletico goalkeeper Jan Oblak pulled off an impressive save from former Barça forward Tello in the home side 's best attempt of the second half .
“ Today we had very few chances and we were much more efficient . Our play was good , the result was better , ” said Atletico coach Diego Simeone .
“ Betis forced us to play three different systems to get more comfortable on the pitch . The good thing is that we are tactically versatile and showed our defensive strength . ”
Midfielder Koke added : “ Betis play spectacular football but we took advantage of the one shot we had and that 's football . We had a very intense week with our trip to London and it was important we won today so we can stay near the top . ”

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his public safety minister are delivering messages of sorrow — but not panic — in the aftermath of a Toronto man 's deadly rampage through city streets in a van .
In an early morning statement , Trudeau said there is no apparent link to terrorism , adding that all Canadians are standing with Toronto as it continues to reel from the attack .

“ The events that took place yesterday in Toronto were a senseless attack and a horrific tragedy , ” Trudeau said , extending condolences to the victims and thanks to the first responders on the scene .
“ They handled this extremely difficult situation with professionalism and bravery . They faced danger without a moment of hesitation , and there is no doubt that their courage saved lives and prevented further injuries . ”

But while Trudeau says the investigation into the incident is still underway , he says there is no evidence to suggest there is a “ national security element ” to the situation .
“ All Canadians are with Toronto today — in our hearts , in our prayers and in our thoughts . ”
Meanwhile , Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale , who happens to be in Toronto for a meeting with other G7 national security ministers , says the attack has led to “ a very large homicide investigation , ” with city police at the helm and every level of government taking part .
Goodale thanked other countries , especially the United States , for their condolences and offers of help . And he , too , commended the first responders .
Like Trudeau , he reiterated that the investigation “ what happened and why ” has only just begun , but sees no reason to draw any links to a national security risk or organized attack .
The @ TorontoPolice and first responders faced danger without hesitation today , and I want to thank them for their courage and professionalism . We 'll continue working with our law enforcement partners as the investigation continues . — Justin Trudeau ( @ JustinTrudeau ) April 24 , 2018
The attack began Monday afternoon when a man allegedly drove a van down a busy stretch of sidewalk on Yonge Street in the city 's north end .
Toronto police have arrested 25-year-old Alek Minassian in the incident .
Minassian is due to appear in court later today .

St. Pius X Church and Arte Divine , in conjunction with the Diocese of Lafayette , today announced that a life-size marble casting of Michelangelo 's ‘ Pietà ' will be in place at St. Pius X Church , 201 East Bayou Parkway , Lafayette , Louisiana on October 5 , 2017 in conjunction with the dedication of the newly constructed church.Five hundred years ago Michelangelo unveiled what would come to be regarded as one of the world 's great masterpieces of inspired art and perhaps the most beautiful sculpture ever created . The Pieta was both the consummate expression of Michelangelo 's artistic abilities and an embodiment of the divine inspiration that guided his work.This famous work of art depicts the body of Jesus on the lap of his mother Mary after the crucifixion . The Vatican Observatory Foundation has authorized and licensed the creation of only 100 Pietà marble castings from a mold derived from the original Pietà that sits inside St. Peter 's Basilica , Vatican City , Rome . While some have been acquired by private collectors , most of these castings are being acquired by generous private or corporate benefactors and then donated to Catholic cathedrals , churches , hospitals , and academic settings as legacy gifts.The Pieta is the only piece of art Michelangelo ever signed . Arte Divine has created this magnificent sculpture in cast Carrara marble from moldings derived from the original Pieta . The result is a precise , exact casting that is faithful to the original Pieta in every detail. “ Our church , school , parish and community are so very blessed to have Michelangelo 's greatest work of religious art ever created , placed here at St Pius X Church , ” said Fr . Steve LeBlanc , Pastor of St. Pius X Church . “ Being able to share this iconic image of our Christian faith with our parishioners and the community of Lafayette is beyond all our expectations. ” Fr . LeBlanc also announced that the Most Reverend J. Douglas Deshotel , Bishop of the Diocese of Lafayette will celebrate the dedication of the newly constructed church at the official ceremony on October 5 , 2017 at 6:30 pm. “ We are truly grateful to the Matt Stuller Family for the opportunity to place Michelangelo 's masterpiece at St. Pius X Church and School . Without their generous donation , the placement would not be possible , ” said Pat Kerivan of Arte Divine. “ It is Arte Divine 's mission to place Michelangelo 's Pietà in 100 sacred and secular settings around the world . In so doing we hope to elevate the hearts and minds of millions of the faithful who may not have the opportunity to travel to Saint Peter 's Basilica in Vatican City , Rome and personally experience the transcendent beauty of this divinely inspired work that is Michelangelo 's Pietà , ” Mr. Kerivan added.For information regarding the upcoming events contact : Barbara Abshire @ 337-232-4656 .

Politics may be at play in the appearance of a draft presidential order that could revive the CIA 's `` black site '' prisons , one former CIA director says .
The appearance of the document , first reported by the New York Times , drew an immediate outcry from both Democratic and Republican lawmakers , as well as CIA veterans .
The draft order calls for a review of the interrogation practices permitted under current U.S. law and whether the CIA should reopen its once-secret network of overseas prisons . But former CIA Director Michael Hayden says he thinks it is more about sending a message than laying serious plans .
`` My instinct is this is a way of reflecting the tough language from the campaign , not a commitment to change anything , '' Hayden told NPR . `` I can not imagine a CIA director saying , 'It 's going to be OK to open a future black site . ' I mean , we 're not doing this again . ''
President Donald Trump endorsed outlawed interrogation methods during the presidential campaign , telling a crowd in South Carolina : `` Torture works , OK , folks ? Believe me . It works , OK ? And waterboarding is your minor form , but we should go much stronger than waterboarding . ''
Trump repeated his support for waterboarding in an interview with ABC News scheduled to air on Wednesday evening , according to previews released by the network . But he also told anchor David Muir that he would defer to Defense Secretary James Mattis and CIA Director Mike Pompeo about whether to use it .
Lawmakers who oversaw the CIA 's previous interrogation and detention programs were quick to criticize the proposals .
`` The president can sign whatever executive orders he likes , '' Arizona Republican Sen. John McCain , chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee , said in a statement . `` But the law is the law . We are not bringing back torture in the United States of America . ''
Sen. Dianne Feinstein , a California Democrat who oversaw the production of a 6,700-page classified report on CIA detention and interrogation programs during her tenure as chairwoman of the Senate Intelligence Committee , also offered a scathing response .
`` Reconstituting this appalling program would compromise our values , our morals and our standing as a world leader — this can not happen , '' she wrote . `` I encourage President Trump to not sign the damaging and dangerous executive order that has been circulating . Read the [ Senate ] report , declassify it and let the American people see for themselves how the program failed to work — I believe they will never want to go there again . ''
Rebuilding the CIA 's network of secret prisons would very likely meet resistance from the agency itself , where many officers feel they were hung out to dry after being asked to take on the job of detaining and interrogating terrorism suspects after the attacks of Sept. 11 , 2001 .
At Pompeo 's Jan. 12 confirmation hearing , senators grilled him , demanding to know whether the CIA was definitively out of the torture business .
`` If you were ordered by the president to restart the CIA 's use of enhanced interrogation techniques that fall outside of the Army Field Manual , would you comply ? '' asked Feinstein .
`` Absolutely not , '' Pompeo replied . `` Moreover , I ca n't imagine that I would be asked that by the president-elect or then-president . ''
But in written answers to follow-up questions by the Senate Intelligence Committee , Pompeo steered a somewhat different course .
Pressed — again by Feinstein — on whether he would commit to refraining from any steps that would bring back waterboarding or other so-called enhanced interrogation techniques , Pompeo wrote :
`` I will consult with experts at the Agency and at other organizations in the U.S. government on whether the Army Field Manual uniform application is an impediment to gathering vital intelligence to protect the country or whether any rewrite of the Army Field Manual is needed . ''
In other words , Pompeo says he will confer with the CIA officers who now report to him on whether the current interrogation rules work . And if not , he 's open to changing them . That review could get underway if Trump signs the draft order revealed on Wednesday .
The president argues that U.S. national security officials have their hands tied . On his visit to CIA headquarters on Jan. 21 , he told the assembled intelligence officers and analysts that `` we 're going to do great things . ... We have not used the real abilities that we have . We 've been restrained . ''
Supporters say the time is right for the U.S. to take another look at the restrictions Congress imposed during the tenure of President Barack Obama , which limit soldiers , intelligence officers and other interrogators to the techniques spelled out in the Army Field Manual .
`` I support very much the idea that we 're going to review — and that 's what the executive order does , '' said Liz Cheney , a Wyoming Republican in the House and daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney .
Her father was a key member of President George W. Bush 's administration when it ordered the use of torture after the 2001 destruction of the World Trade Center . Terrorism suspects were jailed in secret in foreign countries — including Afghanistan , Thailand and Lithuania — and chained , beaten and subjected to other such treatments as interrogators demanded information .
`` I do support enhanced interrogation , '' Liz Cheney told reporters in Philadelphia . `` I think that it 's something that clearly has helped us in the past to prevent attacks and save lives and so I was glad to see President Trump take that step . ''
People still caught up today in the aftermath of the Bush-era decisions , however , called that a bad idea . James Connell , an attorney for alleged Sept. 11 plotter Ammar al-Baluchi , said at the Guantanamo Bay detention center on Wednesday that one reason the trials there are taking so long is the complications caused by the use of brutal interrogations .
Defendants like Baluchi argue the government can not use evidence it extracted from them by torture , but U.S. national security officials say such men are too dangerous to let go . So they have languished in limbo in Guantanamo for years .
`` What this case has demonstrated , if it 's demonstrated anything , is that torture makes criminal cases virtually impossible to prosecute , '' Connell said . `` In fact , it 's fair to say that torture and due process are mutually exclusive . ''

In just a few days from now , it will be fifty years since the Silver Bridge of Point Pleasant , West Virginia crashed into the cold waters of the Ohio River , drowning dozens of people . It 's an event that many researchers and locals have suggested was connected to the presence of the legendary Mothman . There can be few people reading this who have not at least heard of the legendary Mothman of Point Pleasant , West Virginia , who so terrorized the town and the surrounding area between November 1966 and December 1967 , and whose diabolical exploits were chronicled in John Keel 's 1975 book , The Mothman Prophecies .
A winged monster with red eyes , the Mothman appeared out of nowhere and , some say , provoked high tragedy and death . Others , however , suggest that the Mothman is a creature that warns of tragedy and disaster , rather than being the cause of it . But , what was the Mothman of Point Pleasant ? How did the legend start ? And , how did it all end ? Has it even ended ? To answer those questions we have to go back to the dark night of November 12 , 1966 . That was when five grave-diggers working in a cemetery , in the nearby town of Clendenin , were shocked to see what they described as a “ brown human shape with wings ” rise out of the thick , surrounding trees and soar off into the distance .
Three days later , the unearthly beast surfaced once again . It was late at night when Roger and Linda Scarberry and Steve and Mary Mallette – two young couples from the area – were passing the time away by cruising around town in the Scarberrys ' car . After a while , the foursome decided to head out to the West Virginia Ordnance Works , which was basically an abandoned explosives factory that had been used to make TNT during the Second World War , and which was situated a few miles north of town in the McClintic Wildlife Management Area .
As they drove around the old area , the four were puzzled to see in the shadows what looked like two red lights pointing in their direction . These were no normal lights , however . Rather , all four were shocked and horrified to discover that , in reality , the “ lights ” were the red eyes of a huge animal that , as Roger Scarberry would later recall , was “ shaped like a Mothman , but bigger , maybe six and a half or seven feet tall , with big wings folded against its back . ”
They fled the area at high speed . Unfortunately for the four , however , the beast seemingly decided to follow them . As they sped off for the safety of Point Pleasant , the winged monster took to the skies and shadowed their vehicle 's every movement until it reached the city limits . The four raced to the sheriff 's office and told their astounding story to Deputy Millard Halstead , who later stated that : “ I 've known these kids all their lives . They 'd never been in any trouble and they were really scared that night . I took them seriously. ” And even though a search of the area by Halstead did not result in an answer to the mystery , the Mothman would soon return .
Early on the morning of November 25 , yet another remarkable encounter with the mysterious beast took place , as John Keel noted : “ Thomas Ury was driving along Route 62 just north of the TNT area when he noticed a tall , grey manlike figure standing in a field by the road . ‘ Suddenly it spread a pair of wings , ' Ury said , ‘ and took off straight up , like a helicopter . It veered over my convertible and began going in circles three telephone poles high . ' ”
Keel reported that Ury quickly hit the accelerator . Nevertheless , Ury added : “ It kept flying right over my car even though I was doing about seventy-five. ” Over the next few days more sightings surfaced , including that of Ruth Foster of nearby Charleston – who saw the winged monster late at night in her garden , and who said : “ It was tall with big red eyes that popped out of its face . My husband is six feet one and this bird looked about the same height or a little shorter , maybe . ”
Not surprisingly , the local media had a field day with the story . Tales of what were referred to as the “ Bird-Monster ” hit the headlines . Both the skeptics and the police ensured that their views and opinions on the matter were widely known . Dr. Robert L. Smith , Associate Professor of Wildlife Biology in the West Virginia University 's Division of Forestry , expressed his firm opinion that Mothman was nothing stranger than a large sandhill crane . This hardly satisfied the witnesses , however . In response to Dr. Smith 's assertion , Thomas Ury said : “ I 've seen big birds , but I 've never seen anything like this . ”
As for the local police , they offered stern warnings to any and all would-be monster hunters contemplating seeking out the mysterious creature , as the Herald Dispatch newspaper noted : “ Sheriff [ George ] Johnson said he would arrest anybody caught with a loaded gun in the area after dark [ and ] warned that the scores of persons searching the abandoned powerhouse in the TNT area after dark risked possible serious injury . ”
In the months that followed , further encounters with the bizarre beast were reported ; however , they were overshadowed by a tragic event that occurred on December 15 , 1967 . It was on that day that Point Pleasant 's Silver Bridge , which spanned the Ohio River and connected Point Pleasant to Gallipolis , Ohio , collapsed into the river . Tragically , the disaster claimed forty-six lives . And while a down-to-earth explanation most certainly circulated – namely , that a flaw in a single eye-bar in a suspension chain was the chief culprit – many saw , and still continue to see to this very day , the cause as being directly linked with the ominous and brooding presence of the accursed Mothman . Although there is an assumption that the Mothman was not seen again in Point Pleasant , the fact is that reports still surface ; albeit not to the extent that they did back in the sixties .
Finally , for those who want to find out more about Point Pleasant 's Mothman , check out the newly-published book from Loren Coleman , Mothman : Evil Incarnate , which I will be reviewing here at Mysterious Universe in a few days .
WASHINGTON ( AP ) - The Supreme Court appeared divided Tuesday over Texas ' appeal to preserve congressional and legislative districts that a lower court struck down as racially discriminatory .
The justices heard arguments in the latest round of court action over Texas electoral districts that began in 2011 .
At issue are two congressional districts and statehouse districts in four counties , and what the challengers say are efforts by Texas Republicans who control the state government to restrain the political influence of a growing Hispanic and African-American population .
The liberal justices seemed favorable to minority voters and civil rights groups that sued over the districts . The court 's conservatives appeared to lean toward the state , which also has the support of the Trump administration . Justice Anthony Kennedy said nothing to indicate where his potentially decisive vote would fall .
The justices last year kept the challenged districts in place , even after the lower court ruling . Texas held primary elections in those districts in March .
Max Renea , Hicks , a lawyer for the plaintiffs told the justices Tuesday that even if his side wins at the high court , it is unlikely that new districts would be used before the 2020 elections , the last voting cycle before the next census .
The case is the third major dispute this term that is focused on redistricting , the drawing of electoral maps following the once-a-decade census . The high court 's other cases , from Maryland and Wisconsin , focus on the drawing of political districts for partisan advantage .
The Texas situation is unusual . Based on the 2010 census , Texas was awarded four new congressional districts , attributable mainly to the influx of Hispanics .
After the state 's original electoral maps were found to be probably unconstitutional , a three-judge federal court produced interim districting plans that were used in the 2012 elections .
In 2013 , Republicans rushed to permanently adopt those maps to use for the rest of the decade .
But opponents criticized the adopted maps as a quick fix that did n't purge all districts of the impermissible use of race .
In 2017 , the same judges who approved the interim maps in 2012 agreed with the challengers that the maps were the product of intentional discrimination .
Scott Keller , the Texas solicitor general who urged the court to reverse the 2017 ruling , said it is unfair to punish the state for adopting districts the federal judges themselves had agreed could be used . `` This was not the legislature trying to pull a fast one on anyone , '' Keller said .
Justice Department lawyer Edwin Kneedler backed Keller up . Kneedler said Texas should be commended for trying to end the litigation `` so the state could move on . ''
Chief Justice John Roberts suggested that was a reasonable approach . If a state was looking for a way out of a lawsuit with districts that would withstand judicial scrutiny , `` would n't you take a plan the district court drafted ? ''
Hicks said Texas Republicans acted because they were happy with the results of the 2012 election . `` What it had intended to do had in fact happened , '' Hicks said .
The liberal justices also spent a lot of time discussing whether the court had intervened in the case too early . That could allow the court to avoid some of the potentially difficult issues about racial discrimination .

Saftu : National strike will be peaceful

The South African Federation of Trade Unions ( Saftu ) has distanced itself from messages doing the rounds on social media warning that Wednesday 's nationwide strike against the proposed minimum wage will be violent .
Saftu is leading the one-day industrial action in protest to a raft of draft labour laws , which includes a bill on the national minimum wage .
The message says South Africans not participating in the mass action should stay off the roads , public transport and keep their children out of school .
Saftu 's Patrick Craven says the message is malicious .
“ People have nothing to fear . We 'll do everything we possibly can to make sure that the events we organise are peaceful and orderly . We do n't want these messages to distract people from joining the strike . ”
The union 's marches against the proposed R20 per hour minimum wage will be in Johannesburg , Cape Town , Port Elizabeth , Bloemfontein and Polokwane .
‘ IRRESPONSIBLE GRANDSTANDING '
Meanwhile , the Congress of South African Trade Unions ( Cosatu ) and the Federation of Unions of South Africa ( Fedusa ) have distanced themselves from a national strike on Wednesday .
“ Irresponsible grandstanding ” , that 's how Fedusa has described the Saftu-led strike .
It 's rebuffed a call from the federation to back Wednesday 's strike .
Fedusa 's Frank Nxumalo says : “ The strike is highly irresponsible . It is a cheap grandstanding by Saftu . At the moment , the country 's unemployment rate is 26.7 % , according to Stats SA . ”
Nxumalo adds that Fedusa , along with two other labour federations Cosatu and the National Council of Trade Unions , has worked hard during the ongoing national minimum wage negotiations .
Cosatu says it supports the national minimum wage and has no reason to strike over something that will benefit workers .

Bryant first came to notice as second runner-up in the Miss America beauty pageant and became a pop singer with hits including “ Paper Roses , ” “ In My Little Corner of the World , ” and “ Till There Was You. ” Bryant began campaigning against anti-discrimination ordinances on the basis of sexual orientation as the head of the Save Our Children coalition in the late 1970s .
Bruce Cohen , who produced “ Milk ” and “ American Beauty , ” is producing the project along with Allison Sarofim , Stuart Parr , and Hunter Hill . Kasdan will also produce .

CASTING
James Ivory , who won an Academy Award in March for the screenplay for “ Call Me by Your Name , ” will narrate the Italian fantasy film “ Dance Again With Me Heywood ! ” and appear as himself .
The film tells the story of a lonely man living in New York who becomes friends with a young woman through a shared love of dancing . Both suffer from Moon 's Butterfly syndrome , which makes them invisible to everyone — except carriers of the disease .
Michele Dioma is producing and directing the English-language film , which will star Italian actors Giorgio Arcelli Fontana and Ottavia Orticello . The movie is currently in production and will be shot in Brooklyn and Manhattan . Filming is expected to wrap at the end of July .
Ivory will turn 90 on June 7 . He was nominated for directing Oscars for “ Howard 's End ” and “ A Room With a View . ”
Iowa is no longer one of the most lenient states when it comes to people caught texting and driving .
Lieutenant Governor Kim Reynolds kicked off a bill-signing event outside the Iowa Department of Public Safety headquarters this morning .
“ The bill elevates the act of sending a message while driving to a primary traffic offense , ” Reynolds said , “ and that means that if you 're engaging in sending a text and email or video message of any kind , you can be pulled over and issued a citation . ”
The fine for a texting-while-driving ticket will be $ 30 .
“ I 'm confident that this bill will help send the message to drivers in our state : eyes on the road while driving , ' ” Reynolds said .
Governor Branstad was joined at the event by legislators and public safety advocates who lobbied for two bills , both of which Branstad signed into law today . One sets up a new monitoring program for repeat drunken drivers and toughens the penalty to a felony for people caught using their smart phones behind the wheel and killing others on the road . The other bill will let police pull a vehicle over if they suspect the driver is using their smart phone for anything other than navigation or to make a phone call .
“ We were one of the last states to make it a primary offense to text and drive , ” Branstad said . “ I think there 's only four states that had n't done that , so this is certainly a good step in the right direction . I think it 's going to make a difference . ”
The governor , however , had recommended a “ Hands Free ” law that would have completely barred the use of a smart phone while driving .
“ We are pleased that we saw this progress this year and , obviously , we 'll see how this works , ” Branstad said . “ …But a number of states have gone beyong this . Going further with the ‘ hands free ' law is something that should be considered in the future . ”
Iowa Department of Public Safety director Roxann Ryan said with today 's bill signing , Iowa has gone from having one of the weakest to one of the toughest laws on texting while driving .
“ We cover anything that you 're doing on the internet , anything on your phone , anything on any another electronic device , ” Ryan said . “ We truly are making a difference and I think when people begin to realize how distracted they are when they 're driving and they 're using electronic devices , hands free is going to be much easier argument to make in the future . ”
“ Lane departures ” were cited in 68 percent of recent traffic fatalities . Ryan said drivers who are distracted with their smart phone tend to drift out of their lane and drive too fast . Branstad says distracted driving , drunk driving and excessive speed are all contributing to the recent increase in traffic fatalities in Iowa .

ISLAMABAD - Imran Tigers lifted the Insaf Twenty20 Talent Hunt Cricket Tournament title after defeating Imran Fighters in the final played here at Diamond Cricket Ground on Sunday .
PTI chairman Imran Khan was the chief guest on the occasion . It was a completely messed up affair , as Imran Khan 's supporters , women wing officials and so-called Imran Tigers were occupying the stage , while journalists were left high and dry , as no one was allowed to even have a glance of Imran . It was n't looked like a sports event , but a political activity .
After this mess , the match was played in comparatively better way and after a tough clash , it was ended with Imran Tigers finishing as winners . The chief guest awarded trophies and certificates among the teams and individuals .
Addressing the media , Imran Khan congratulated the winning team and lauded the efforts of PTI Sports and Cultural Wing for organising the event for youth of the country . Imran termed departments as cancer to Pakistan cricket and main reason behind Pakistan domestic cricket failure . “ The mafia sitting at the helm of affairs is not ready to let genuine and deserving players get the nod of approval . I still believe Pakistan has most talented youth and can beat any given side at any given pitches , not only at subcontinent or UAE tracks . ”
He said : “ If voted to power , I will introduce system , which will enhance our domestic structure and our bowlers and batsmen can easily compete with any given team . There is no system exists in Pakistan , which can bring talent to mainstream . We will bring international teams to Pakistan and make Pakistan team a force to be reconned by producing quality fast bowlers . “ We will continue to organise events like these in future too and ensure youth involved in healthy positive activities rather than wasting their talent , ” he added .

Minister for Water and Power Khawaja Muhammad Asif Sunday said elevation of the judges of superior judiciary was made purely in accordance with the constitutional mandate and command .
The minister , in a statement here , said certain quarters known to be notorious in maligning others in order to justify their existence had now started to malign the highest judicial office of the state .
‘ The smear campaign is rampant on the social media designed specifically to undermine certain offices whose sanctity is sine qua non for the independent functioning of the justice system of the country , ' he added .
Khawaja Asif , who is also Minister for Defence , said Justice Mian Saqib Nisar was elevated to the position of the Chief Justice of Pakistan ( CJP ) strictly on merit and in accordance with Article 175A ( 3 ) of the Constitution which provided that the senior most judge be appointed as the CJP .
‘ The government or the PM ( Prime Minister ) has no role in his appointment . The appointment of any other person would have been unconstitutional , ' he maintained . The minister said after the decisions in the Al Jehad Trust and Sajjad Ali Shah cases and the 18th Amendment to the Constitution , only the senior most judge of the Supreme Court could be appointed as its chief justice .
Justice Saqib Nisar , he said , being the senior most judge alone could have been appointed as the chief justice , which was the constitutional mandate .
The appointment of anybody else would have been a violation of the constitution , he added . The minister said Chief Justice Mian Saqib Nisar was indeed the law secretary but appointed as the first non-judge after Sir Edmund Nelson for three reasons . 1 . The Al-Jehad decision appeared to suggest that judges should not be appointed to such positions . 2 . Chief Justice Sajjad Ali Shah made it clear that no judge would be made available for this post . 3 . Khalid Anwar , a lawyer of great eminence was the Law Minister and Saqib Nisar was his choice as the law secretary.—APP

Vancouver art rockers Blessed have joined forces with Winnipeg noise punk trio Tunic to put together an extremely loud , incredibly fast split . Today , we 've got two killer tracks off their upcoming collab . Completely distinct from one another in virtually every sonic sense , these two songs demonstrate just how broad the umbrella of post-punk can span .
Though they do n't fit neatly into any one genre , Blessed are known for their sprawling , off-kilter tracks . In their seven minute opus , “ Sound , ” angular math-rocky rhythms spill into zig-zagging guitar riffs , all alongside Drew Riekman 's vocals . On this track , Blessed 's sound feels at once unpredictable and instinctual , similar to their art-rock contemporaries Palm .
Riekman offers some background :
We tracked “ Sound ” during a session in Montreal with a new producer , Jace Lasek . It evolved from a scratch take we did ; wherein the drums came out sounding how we wanted immediately and we were able to use the extra time to experiment sonically and build on top of the initial demo . We invited our friend , Ola Kado , into the session to track violin pizzicato , which we ended up blending into the last half of the track . The song grew into itself over an amalgamation of new ideas we all brought to it , and we 're excited with where it ended up from where it began .
Whereas Blessed 's last EP , II , came in at around 24 minutes , Tunic 's Boss was around 10 , if that 's any indication of how much the two bands differ . Tunic 's jagged noise punk comes in like a hammer striking a glass door , shocking but nonetheless satisfying . When you finish listening to a Tunic song , you 'll feel like you 're out of breath . “ Teeth Showing ” is an apt title for their high-speed , serrated track off the upcoming split . On their Bandcamp , the Winnipeg natives succicntly self-identify as “ fast noise and loud shouting , ” which is just about right .
Here 's more from Tunic 's David Schellenberg :
“ Teeth Showing ” was one of the last songs we wrote in 2017 . It 's one of those songs that just sort of fell out of us . We had just wrapped up about half a dozen other songs , so we knew what ideas were working , so we just went with it and we created what we jokingly called our “ Rock Song ” . Lyrically , this song continues to explore my dissatisfaction at the time with some of my more recent life choices . I describe things about a former partner that I miss , and that use to be really important to me .
Blessed and Tunic both have knack for bending time and sound in a way that will make you question what post-punk really even means . Check out the songs below , where you can also find Blessed and Tunic 's tour dates together .

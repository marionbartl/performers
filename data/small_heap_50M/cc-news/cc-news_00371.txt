In the latest installment of the ongoing saga of Russia-based cybersecurity firm Kaspersky Lab and the U.S. government , the company has a new date with Congress . Rescheduling a hearing originally set for last week , the House Committee on Science , Space and Technology has set a new hearing for October 25 , Reuters reports .
News of the rescheduled hearing comes a day after the company was linked to successful Russian efforts to hack the NSA , though the Kaspersky software in question could have itself been hacked through a vulnerability .
Kaspersky Lab founder Eugene Kaspersky was expected to appear in the previous hearing , and it sounds like he 'll probably plan on being there in late October to defend his company in his own words .
“ I look forward to hearing from the committee and having the opportunity to address their concerns directly , ” Kaspersky said in a statement to TechCrunch .

AMMAN - United Nations agencies have expressed `` deep concern '' for the safety and security of nearly 50,000 Syrians stranded in the desert near their war-wracked country 's southern border with Jordan .
A statement issued on Sunday in Amman said an estimated 4,000 people at Hadalat and 45,000 mostly women and children at Rukban were stuck on the frontier . A suicide bombing claimed by the Islamic State militant group in June last year killed seven Jordanian soldiers in no-man 's land near the Rukban border crossing .
Soon afterwards , the army declared Jordan 's desert regions that stretch northeast to Syria and east to Iraq `` closed military zones '' .
Jordan is part of the US-led coalition fighting IS .
`` Airstrikes have been reported in the area in the last few days , causing serious distress and panic amongst the population fearing for their lives with the heightened risk of escalated hostilities , '' Sunday 's statement said .
It said that although no casualties have yet been reported among the stranded Syrians , `` the area is increasingly unsafe '' , prompting some people to leave the area . This exposed them to `` further danger and deprivation in an inhospitable desert location , unsure of where to go in search of safety '' . The UN said the most vulnerable , mostly women and children , were unable to return home because of the war in Syria .
More than 330,000 people have been killed in Syria and millions displaced since the country 's conflict erupted in March 2011 with anti-government protests . Jordan shares a desert border of more than 370 kilometres ( 230 miles ) with Syria .
The UN refugee agency says it has registered more than 650,000 Syrian refugees in Jordan since the conflict began . Amman says it is hosting 1.3 million Syrian refugees .

Chevrolet this week revealed that its 2019 Corvette ZR1 blasted around Virginia International Raceway 's Grand Course West in a time of 2:37.25 during routine testing last month , beating the previous record set by a Ford GT by a full 1.37 seconds . Now , if the front-engine Corvette is already this fast , we can only imagine what the presumably faster mid-engine Corvette will muster .

Speaking of the '90s , British sports car marque Lister , which has n't launched a new car since the decade , this week came out with a new Thunder sports car . We use the term “ new ” lightly , however , because the car unveiled by Lister is actually a modified Jaguar F-Type with 666 horsepower on tap .

A new Cadillac sedan was spotted testing this week . It will go by the name CT5 and should be the closest embodiment of Cadillac 's stunning Escala concept we 're likely to see . Set to replace both the ATS and CTS , the CT5 will be sized like a BMW 5-Series but priced like a 3-Series when it debuts in 2019 .

Tim Hortons called the lawsuit “ unfounded , ” in a statement by its media relations team
The legal battle between a group of Tim Hortons franchisees and their parent company escalated Friday as the corporate-unsanctioned association filed a lawsuit alleging that Restaurant Brands International , its subsidiary and several executives continually subvert their right to associate .
The defendants have engaged in conduct that “ seeks to interfere with , restrict , penalize , or threaten franchisees from exercising their rights to associate , ” according to a lawsuit filed in an Ontario Superior Court of Justice on behalf of two franchisees who belong to the Great White North Franchisee Association . None of the claims have been proven in court .
Tim Hortons called the lawsuit “ unfounded , ” in a statement by its media relations team .
“ We have always been clear that we will not interfere with our franchisees ' right to associate and that remains true today , ” it read , adding the lawsuit is the latest tactic of the group 's “ disregard for the brand and our restaurant owners . ”
The GWNFA , which incorporated in March to raise franchisee concerns over the management of the brand , alleges the defendants systematically stymied their group .
The claim alleges this pattern includes the defendants denying future store opportunities to franchisees because they are “ not aligned ” with Tim Hortons 's interest and setting aside a $ 2 billion fund to buy out franchisees who have joined the GWNFA or may do so in the future .

“ It is happening . We know it 's happening , ” said GWNFA president David Hughes , one of the lead plaintiffs .
He hopes the lawsuit , which is seeking about $ 850 million in damages from RBI and its subsidiary , will force the parent company to reconsider legal action it commenced late last month .
RBI subsidiary the TDL Group Corp. served default notices to all of the GWNFA 's board members , including Hughes , on Sept. 18 . The company accused them of providing confidential information to Tim Hortons former CEO Don Schroeder , who then allegedly gave it to a Canadian newspaper .
Schroeder and the GWNFA deny these claims , and the association included the legal action in its statement of claim as proof of the company 's efforts to hamper its operations .
This is the group 's second lawsuit against the company .
In June , a $ 500-million lawsuit filed on behalf of franchisee and GWNFA member Mark Kuziora alleged RBI improperly used money from a national advertising fund . The allegations have not been proven in court and RBI said at the time that it vehemently disagrees with and denies all the allegations .
The lawsuit is currently in the preliminary stages , said Hughes , and the GWNFA hopes it will move before a judge in early 2018 .
While the two sides are now mostly communicating through lawyers , Hughes said the association is willing to sit down with executives and work out a fair deal for franchisees .
Until that deal is achieved , it does n't appear Hughes will back down .
“ I 'm the guy that started . I 'm the guy that 's going to stand . If I 'm the last man standing , so be it . ”

SIALKOT-The Punjab government has failed to establish 5.5 kilometre protective dyke along the River Chenab near village Maahiwal to save dozens of the surrounding villages and national infrastructure from floods .
The monsoon is starting from June 15 , 2018 . Besides hundreds of nearby villages , the Sialkot International Airport and Sialkot Tannery Zone are also situated near the river . Due to this critical condition , dozens of the surrounding villages including Rakh Nowshera , Khasa , Chhani Gondal , Gaggar Mughalaan , Dheengowal , Maahiwal , Dor R.B. , Bhakhreywali , Kulluwal , Majra Kalan , Sambrial , Suraj , Kot Maha Raj , Hambokey and Kaliyaar were left at the mercy of the recurring floods in the River Chenab .
Leader of the local affected people Mirza Ajmal Baig , a resident of village Gaggar Mughalaan , told the newsmen that there was a dire need of early establishment of the protective dyke along the banks of River Chenab . But instead of constructing the dyke , the 5.5km area has been left at the mercy of floods . The flood in River Chenab would wash out 31 villages of Sambrial tehsil completely and 71 other villages would partially be affected by the coming flood .
He said that if a flow of 200,000 cusec floodwater in River Chenab at Head Maral-Sialkot , passes through the river , the floodwater would badly affect the 200 villages in Bela Area , all the villages in Sambrial tehsil .
Ajmal Baig said that the protective dyke was to be constructed under the ongoing project of establishment of a bridge over River Chenab near Shehbazpur to connect the both Sialkot and Gujrat districts .
On the other hand , the bridge over River Chenab at Shehbazpur has already been completed , but the certain areas in both Sialkot and Gujrat districts have been left at the mercy of the circumstances . No practical steps have yet been taken by the Punjab government 's Communication and Works Department to ensure the construction of the protective dyke at this area from where the flood will badly affect the dozens of the villages of Sambrial tehsils , and more than 200 villages in the Bela Areas along the banks of the River Chenab , added Mirza Ajmal Baig .
The local people said that the coming floods in River Chenab would badly affect the rural population of both Sialkot and Gujrat districts .
Hundreds of people belonging to the dozens of the surrounding villages staged a demonstration against non-construction of 5.5km protective dyke under the new design of River Chenab .
They said that the fast flow of floodwater in River Chenab will kill them . The affected people urged the government to save their lives as well .
Meanwhile , the managements of Sialkot international airport and Sialkot Tannery Zone have also appealed to the government to save these projects from coming flood disasters there .
When contacted , the district administration said that the entire situation was already communicated to the Punjab government for further action or any go ahead in this regard .
A few days ago , Deputy Commissioner Farrukh Naveed , Chairperson of Sialkot District Council Hina Arshad Warraich , MPA Arshad Javaid and officials of the Punjab government visited the spot and examined the situation . They said that there was a dire need of the early establishment of the protective dyke .
BOSSES at a West Berkshire Council-run care home failed to report suspected abuse of residents , a damning new report has revealed .
Inspectors from the Care Quality Commission ( CQC ) found residents “ were not safeguarded from abuse ” and “ not kept safe ” during a recent visit to Birchwood Care Home in Newbury .
The inspectors ' report details instances of potential abuse at the home , including one resident being force-fed medication and another receiving an unexplained fracture to their arm – neither of which were reported to the CQC .
The home has been placed in special measures by the CQC after inspectors rated the service “ inadequate ” .
West Berkshire Council , which took over the running of the care home in June , said it was “ disappointed ” with the findings and that an action plan to improve the service was being implemented .
The health watchdog was prompted to carry out the two-day inspection at the 60-bed care home after being tipped off about potential abuse and a number of other safety concerns by family members , health professionals , staff and also the local authority .
During the visits , on September 29 and October 1 , inspectors said they identified “ several ” breaches of the Health and Social Care Act .
At one point , inspectors had to intervene to stop a resident accessing an un-attended and unlocked medicine trolley .
In another instance , one family member told the inspectors how they had had to clean their relative 's en-suite bathroom themselves after staff failed to notice another resident had used it and left it in a mess .
They also said the service was “ not responsive to people 's needs ” and did not have “ adequate management or leadership ” .
New management had been put in place when the care home was taken over by the council .
The care home was also criticised by the inspectors for not keeping adequate records and paperwork relating to the care of its elderly residents .
The situation was particularly critical , said the CQC , because of the high number ( 55 per cent ) of agency staff used at the home .
Improvements must now be made before the next inspection which will take place in the next six months .
The care home , in Birchwood Road , is one of four managed by the local authority .
The other three , Notrees Care Home in Kintbury , Walnut Close Care Home in Thatcham and Willows Edge Care Home in Newbury , are all rated “ good ” by the CQC .
West Berkshire Council spokesman Martin Dunscombe said : “ The council took over Birchwood in June when it had ‘ requires improvement ' status and promptly identified further areas of concern which also needed tackling .
“ We are already implementing a clear action plan to not only bring standards at Birchwood in line with our other care homes , which are all rated ‘ good ' , but also to offer 10 step-down beds to help speed the recovery of people who would otherwise have to stay in a hospital .
“ However , this will take longer than the four-month period on which the CQC have judged .
He added : “ We look forward to the next inspection and we expect many of our planned improvements to be well established by then . ”
Chief officer at Healthwatch West Berkshire Andrew Sharp said the organisation was very concerned about the findings .
He said : “ This is very much now on our radar with a view that the service makes the improvements necessary so that residents who use the facility can do so in confidence and have faith that they will receive the level of care they expect .
“ I 'm hoping that West Berkshire Council can improve things in a way that the previous management were unable to do . ”
2017 F1 : Drivers unhappy with extra Halo weight
Posted by : Admin on Aug 14 , 2017 - 06:53 AM 2017 F1 : Drivers unhappy with extra Halo weight
While most focus on the aesthetics , it is another feature of the controversial 'Halo ' system that might actually have a more significant impact on F1 . The fact the carbon-titanium cockpit protection system will be mandatory on all cars next year has sparked a furious debate .
But while some rail against the questionable aesthetics of the 'flip flop'-like addition over the traditional open cockpit , another major consideration is the 10-plus kilograms that 'Halo ' weighs . Indeed , the Swiss newspaper Blick reports that with the cars already weighing a hefty 728kg this year , the mandatory minimum weight will only increase by 5kg next year to accommodate Halo . `` Does that mean the drivers will have to lose the other 5 kilograms ? '' the report wondered . Lewis Hamilton admits : `` You can not ignore Halo if it improves safety by 17 per cent . It just does n't look good and the extra weight is n't good either . '' Carlos Sainz added : `` We should not have to be as slim as cyclists just because of the cars . '' F1 legend Niki Lauda even thinks Halo `` destroys the DNA '' of formula one , but Valtteri Bottas does not quite agree with his Mercedes boss . `` I do n't think Halo will hurt formula one , '' said the Finn . `` It is a safety improvement like so many others in the history of the sport , which is good for us drivers , '' he told Auto Bild . `` The only drawback is the extra weight , because the heavier the cars are , the less exciting they are . ''

CLEVELAND ( AP )  The new prosecutor in Cleveland says over 70 cases involving sexual assaults of children went unattended for months or years as that office failed to properly track the cases or bring charges .
Cuyahoga ( ky-uh-HOH'-guh ) County Prosecutor Michael O'Malley says a review by his office has prompted changes to its tracking of such cases and could lead to potentially hundreds of new charges .
Three lawyers who handled most of the dormant cases have been forced to resign . Four more were disciplined .
Prosecutors tell Cleveland.com that some of the cases involved suspects who confessed or who later committed other crimes .

The office also is reviewing more than 1,900 cases categorized as `` inactive '' in the past few years to see whether assistant prosecutors wrongly labeled those and stopped receiving computer alerts about them .

The accountability court , hearing the Avenfield reference against the Sharif family , has reserved its verdict in the case , which will be announced on July 6 .
Nawaz Sharif and his family are facing three corruption cases in the accountability court after the National Accountability Bureau filed references against them in light of the Supreme Court 's verdict in the Panama Papers case last year .
The accountability court resumed hearing of the case on Tuesday , where Maryam Nawaz and Captain ( retd ) Safdar 's counsel presented his final arguments . Judge Mohammad Bashir , during the hearing on June 29 , had directed Maryam 's counsel Amjad Pervez to conclude his final arguments on July 2 in any case .
However , the hearing on July 2 was adjourned until Tuesday after Pervez failed to conclude his arguments .
The accountability court has heard the case for nine and-a-half months and reserved the verdict against Nawaz Sharif , Maryam Nawaz and Captain ( retd ) Safdar .
Nawaz 's sons , Hasan and Hussain , have already been declared absconders in the case . Nawaz and other accused were asked 127 questions in the case , while no witness appeared before the court on behalf of the defence .
Authorities also recorded statements of two witnesses through a video-link from London . The court conducted 107 hearings of the case over the past nine and a half months .
Nawaz and Maryam attended 78 hearings , whereas defence counsels cross-examined Wajid Zia , head of Panama case joint investigation team , for around two weeks . On the whole , 18 witnesses recorded their statements in the case .
Last week , Nawaz 's counsel , Khawaja Haris , had also concluded his final arguments in the case . The former premier and his daughter are in London on account of Begum Kulsoom Nawaz 's ailment . On Monday , the court had granted them two-day exemption from proceedings .
The trial against the Sharif family had commenced on September 14 , 2017 . The corruption references , filed against the Sharifs , pertain to the Al-Azizia Steel Mills and Hill Metal Establishment , offshore companies including Flagship Investment Limited , and Avenfield properties of London .
Nawaz and his sons , Hussain and Hasan , are accused in all three references whereas his daughter Maryam and son-in-law Safdar are accused in the Avenfield reference only . The court originally had a deadline of six months which ended in mid-March but was extended for two months after the judge requested the apex court .

Charlestown hockey standout Matt Grzelcyk secured a major step in his professional career on Tuesday when he secured a roster spot on the Boston Bruins team – making complete his journey from the Emmons Horrigan O'Neil Memorial Rink in Thompson Square to over the highway at the TD Garden on Canal Street .
The news traveled fast in the Town on Tuesday , when the Bruins unveiled their opening night roster in the afternoon , and Grzelcyk was on it as a defenseman wearing # 48 .
That came after a very competitive camp for Grzelcyk and several young players who have given Bruins fans a tremendous amount of hope for this year and the future of the team .
Grzelcyk grew up in Charlestown , and his family still resides in the Town . He got his start in the Charlestown Youth Hockey Association ( CYHA ) , which has been a point of pride for the organization as Grzelcyk has moved from Belmont Hill to Boston University and now to the Bruins .
“ Congratulations to Matt Grzelcyk on being named to the Boston Bruins roster for the 2017-2018 season , ” said Al Carrier of the CYHA . “ Matt is such an amazing young hockey player of upstanding character , and he has worked so hard to get to this pinnacle in his young hockey career . We wish him the best of luck and ca n't wait to see this new Charlestown Hockey hero take the ice . ”
Grzelcyk faced stiff competition during camp and pre-season this year , having spent the bulk of last year in Providence , and also competing against a new crop of budding Bruins stars . In the end , he won out over some very talented defensemen and hopes to continue on the roster for the rest of the year .
Last year , he came up from Providence during the season for two games , and made a very good showing .

Earnell Lucas , candidate for Milwaukee County Sheriff has a new vision . A vision to restore trust between the Sheriff department and the community .
“ I 've seen the changes that have occurred at the sheriff 's office and I feel Milwaukee deserves better , ” Lucas said .
“ My vision is a department that respects human life whether it 's with our interactions with the public that we serve , whether it 's with those detained in our facilities or whether it 's the interaction between one another and how we treat each other , ” said Lucas .
A Marquette University graduate , Lucas has over 40 years of law enforcement experience . His experience includes 25 years at the Milwaukee Police Department and after a nationwide search , Lucas was recruited to serve as Major League Baseball 's Head of Security . He believes his local , national and international experience prepares him uniquely to become the next sheriff .
Lucas was taught hard work , honor , integrity and dedication from his grandmother who raised him after the death of his mother . Those lessons made a positive impact on his life .
“ I 'm a product of this community , I was born in Hillside housing project . We lived on the upper west side until the disturbances in 1967 , then we moved to the Harambee neighborhood . I 'm from this community , I still attend St. Matthew C.M.E . Church and still have friends that I had as a boy . I know this community very well and we got a lot of work to do . I 'm ready to roll up my sleeves on day one to help restore this communities trust in law enforcement again .
When asked about the series of wrongful death claims filed for those who lost their lives while being detained at the Milwaukee County Jail , Lucas believes accountability seems to be lacking .
“ There 's been approximately seven deaths in the last 18 months that the previous sheriff , even the acting sheriff are accountable . They 're accountable for what transpired , and accountable for those people who were detained in their facility , ” Lucas said . “ The jail is a facility to detain persons who have not been adjudicated in a courtroom and in this case and every case that should not be a sentence to die . ”
Lucas maintains moving forward that policies and procedures for the care and upkeep of the facility need to be put in place . There also needs to be proper healthcare for people in custody . He says that a lot of the programs for people detained at the facilities were removed by the previous administration .
“ I do n't think that was the right decision for the people who are detained . Give them something to do , give them something to read , some alternatives and have them have at least some hope of never having to return there , ” Lucas said .
In a politically divisive environment , Lucas separates himself from his predecessor by focusing on what is important for the community and restoring the trust . Sheriff Clarke , who resigned in August 2017 , was regularly scrutinized for the mismanagement of the department .
“ One of the things that I made very clear at the onset when I announced my candidacy was this race is not about person , it 's not about party , it 's about the people of Milwaukee County , ” Lucas said . “ I feel somewhere along the way the former sheriff said and made some transgressions against this community and some got perpetuated by the national media . ”
There will be three Democrats running for Milwaukee County sheriff in the Aug. 14 primary . Lucas , Acting Sheriff Richard Schmidt who took over the post after serving as deputy to Clarke , and Deputy Robert Ostrowski .
The general election is Nov. 6 .
Plenty of people love to spend the holidays at a ski resort ― and it looks like this lynx is no exception . The cat was spotted last week by Airrick Hix at the Purgatory Resort in Durango Colorado , and the footage was shared on Facebook by Colorado Parks and Wildlife . Lynx-spotting quickly became almost as popular as skiing and snowboarding at the resort . It was seen again on New Year 's Eve by snowboarder Christian Dufresne : And on New Year 's Day by‎ Jeremy Rowse : “ Lynx pose no threat to humans , ” Colorado Parks and Wildlife said on Facebook . “ But people should not approach any wildlife. ” The department also said it does n't want the animals to become habituated to humans . The Canada lynx , which is considered threatened , is protected under the Endangered Species Act . The U.S . Fish and Wildlife Service said “ timber harvest , recreation and their related activities ” are the main threat to the habitat of the lynx as well as its main prey , the snowshoe hare .

People with anxiety disorders often face a sense of worry or dread and spend hours ruminating over worst case scenarios , which can get in the way of professional goals , personal relationships and a good quality of life . But there are ways to cope . Here , experts offer their best techniques to work through situations that might drum up anxiety , which may help you or someone you know keep worry or fear at bay : 1 . Put your worrisome thoughts on a schedule . If you are going about your day and notice anxious thoughts , identify the thought stream and then postpone thinking about it until later , Ricks Warren , a clinical associate professor of psychiatry at the University of Michigan , told The Huffington Post . Warren calls this technique “ worry postponement ” or a “ worry scheduling ” skill , which can be very effective . For example , you might be at a movie and find yourself becoming anxious about an upcoming work presentation . To postpone and schedule , pause and metaphorically put that whole worry on a shelf . Say to yourself , “ I 'm not at work right now . I will think about this tomorrow at the office. ” Later on , when it is time to consider what was making you feel anxious , you might consider discussing the issue with someone you trust . Monica Rodriguez via Getty Images 2 . Develop a “ catastrophe scale. ” Draw a line on a piece of paper . Write the number zero at the beginning of the line , 50 in the middle and 100 at the end . This is what Warren calls a “ catastrophe scale. ” Then ask yourself , “ What are the worst possible things that could happen ? ” Write those things down on the side with the highest values . “ When you think about a child dying , or a terrible accident , it helps people put things in perspective , ” Warren said . “ Not everything gets a 100. ” Being late for a job interview or a blunder at a party are unfortunate events . But , as Warren hopes you 'll come to believe , they 're not scenarios you should be terribly hard on yourself about in the scheme of things . The goal for the rating system is that you eventually break down what you 'd need to do in order to cope with it . This could be rallying a supportive group of friends , making a phone call or simply working out to reduce your stress and let it go . 3 . Break big projects into small tasks . Worry and anxiety can find their way into the workplace , showing up in the form of procrastination , says Keith Humphreys , professor of psychiatry at Stanford University . “ [ People with anxiety ] often want to show up on time , wanting to complete the work . Anxiety is what paralyzes them , ” Humphreys told HuffPost . Humphreys suggests breaking down overwhelming projects into the smallest possible task . Small goals are effective for those dealing with social anxiety as well . If going to a party feels overwhelming , do n't worry about becoming the life of the party . Just set one small goal such as greeting the host , or talking to one person you do not know . Shannon Fagan via Getty Images 4 . Prove your anxiety wrong . Research from the University of California , Los Angeles ' Anxiety and Depression Research Center found that when people with anxiety expose themselves to their anxiety trigger , it actually helps them cope better . By showing yourself that the worst did n't happen , you 'll minimize the fear you experience . For example , say you are afraid of riding the subway and your worst fear is that you 'll get stuck for ages without help . Head underground with your worst fears in tow . After you ride the subway , without getting stuck , you successfully disprove your worst hypothesis . This can be an empowering exercise , Warren says . 5 . Force your body into a state of calm . Your body already has a built-in stress reliever , it 's just a matter of tapping into it . “ Focus on your breathing , put your feet flat on the floor . Smile even if you do n't feel like smiling , ” Humphreys advised . “ Tense your muscles then let them go , then tense them again and repeat . Relax your body and a lot of people will find your emotions will follow. ” Ascent/PKS Media Inc. via Getty Images 6 . Cultivate acceptance about your anxiety . According to Warren , there 's a big difference between accepting your anxiety and accepting yourself as someone who experiences anxiety . “ People put themselves down for being anxious , ” he explained . “ Accept yourself with anxiety and notice that you 're not alone. ” And it 's true : An anxiety disorder is the most common mental health condition in the country , with nearly 40 million American adults experiencing it over their lifetime . It 's critical to cultivate self compassion about your condition . “ Support yourself with anxiety , just as if a friend was there supporting you , ” Warren said . 7 . Remember that anxiety disorders are highly treatable . “ If it 's serious and you 're paralyzed with anxiety everyday , there are mental health treatments that really work , ” Humphreys said . And if you are not experiencing this condition , but know someone who is , try to be as empathetic as possible to what he or she is going through . According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , only 25 percent of people with a mental health disorder feel like others are understanding about their experience . Above all , it 's important to remember that you deserve to feel calm and healthy . Despite what your anxious thoughts might lead you to believe , the stakes are a lot lower than you think . “ We would worry a lot less what other people thought of us if we knew how rarely they did , ” Humphreys said .

Dubai - A meeting has been scheduled between star all-rounder Shahid Afridi and PCB chairman Shahryar Khan and PSL chairman Najam Sethi in Dubai .
Afridi had requested the PCB officials for meeting during which important decision regarding farewell is likely to be taken . The sources said that the meeting will be held on April 23 or April 24 as Shahryar Khan and Najam Sethi will be in Dubai to participate in International Cricket Council ( ICC ) session . It is to be mentioned here that Shahid Afridi announced retirement from international format on February 20 , 2017 and ending an illustrious and sometimes controversial 21-year career .
Nicknamed Boom Boom , Afridi had been a fan favourite since he burst onto the scene in 1996 , striking a 37-ball one-day century against Sri Lanka in only his second match to set a world record that was unbeaten for 18 years . He became known as a leg-spin bowling all-rounder in the second half of his career and was instrumental in Pakistan s early successes in Twenty20 , including their 2009 victory .
Afridi finished his international career having played just 27 Test matches which yielded 1,176 runs with the highest score of 156 and 48 wickets .
He played 398 one-day internationals with 8,064 runs , the highest score of 124 while taking 395 wickets with his leg spin . His Twenty20 international CV saw him play 98 matches with 1,405 runs and a career-leading 97 wickets .

The answer is no , we 're still doomed to die on this planet by a combination of rising sea levels and a Trump-launched nuclear war , but there is some good news : Grimes has collaborated with K-pop outfit Loona yyxy ( a sub-unit of the 12-member collective Loona ) on a new song .
Titled “ love4eva ” , it 's a hyperactive and bubbly track , streaked with colorful synths and a jarring , twisted dubstep breakdown around the bridge . It 's both unexpected for Grimes yet also totally in line with her philosophy of pushing the boundaries of pop music . I say bring it on .
Take a listen below .
“ love4eva ” appears on Loona yyxy 's latest EP , Beauty & the Beat . As for Grimes , she 's been steadily working on new music , which she hopes to release soon . 2015 's Art Angels was her last full-length .
Oh , yeah — and , at the encouragement of music , she 's also legally changing her name .
Iran Focus
London , 15 Feb - The Iranian Regime 's supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , recently made a brazen statement about not ‘ fearing ' the new US President , but they should be scared .
Turki Aldakhil , the General Manager of Al Arabiya News Channel , wrote an op-ed for Al Arabiya regarding Khamenei 's comments and how meaningless they are .
Khamenei said : “ I do not fear Drumpf . We must thank the new American president because he showed the real face of America and because he exposed what we have been saying for decades about the political , moral and economic corruption in it . ”
Aldakhil warns that America has returned to its roots “ in terms of engaging with world crises and contributing to managing its development ” , and that Iran should be wary of engaging with Trump in the same way that it engaged with Obama .
He wrote : “ The current US administration is convinced that its predecessor 's legacy on Iran weighs heavy on its shoulders . Development of ballistic missiles is the result of the Obama administration 's complete negligence . The major reason of terrorism in the region is Iran . The latter 's involvement in Syria has awakened sectarianism in the region and it is time to discipline this political rebellion represented by the Iranian regime . ”
Indeed , in the first three weeks of the administration , so much has happened to shake Iran :
• Defence Secretary James Mattis announced at a press conference that Iran was the world 's leading state sponsor of terrorism
• The White House announced that all options , including military action , were on the table
• The White House put Iran “ on notice ” following a ballistic missile test
Hamid Reza , the media and cultural consultant of the Revolutionary Guards , tried to tell the press that Trump was merely aiming for media
attention , but if that were true , would Reza really have been so angry ?
Aldakhil notes that the Trump administration may be harkening back to the George W Bush era of foreign policy .
He wrote : “ The Iranian regime is passing through a different phase amid domestic unrest . It is faced with a suffocating economic crisis , which is leading to growing poverty and unemployment . Meanwhile , it is spending tens of billions on the leaders and commanders of terrorist groups . The commanders of the Revolutionary Guards receive wages that are enough to support an entire state . Iran has engaged in absurd wars which it will not exit from until after it 's broken – in Yemen or Syria or even Iraq . ”
Ultimately , Iran should be scared , even if it wants to lie to the rest of the world about it .
ISLAMABAD - Minister of State for Information , Broadcasting and National Heritage Marriyum Aurangzeb on Wednesday directed the authorities concerned to augment children content in the programmes of all PTV channels .
Chairing a consultative meeting on the launch of Children Entertainment Channel here , she asked PTV to submit a detailed and comprehensive time-wise plan for the embedment of children content in the running PTV channels .
The Minister said that separate children entertainment channel was the need of the hour as no work had been done so far for children entertainment and boosting the broadcasting industry , said a Press release .
She said that indigenous content was quite imperative to connect future generations with our culture and heritage .
Our children need a kind of content that could educate them and build their character by generating feelings , of goodness , modesty and inquisitiveness about the world around them , she added .
Marriyum Aurangzeb directed PTV management to utilise all possible resources to produce quality content for kids , which can help to inculcate in them the cultural and religious values as well as make them aware of the traditions of our society .
The meeting also deliberated upon various fast-track options with the least cost for the launch of a dedicated children entertainment channel .
The meeting was attended by Secretary IB & NH and senior officials from the Ministry and PTV .

Disney Research has been working on a way to turn natural language scripts into virtual reality ( VR ) pre-visualizations . While currently focusing on VR story creation , the tool could ultimately be used for traditional filmmaking as well , said Disney Research digital platforms group lead Sasha Schriber during a talk at the Virtual Reality Developers Conference ( VRDC ) in San Francisco Monday .
Pre-visualizations , rough draft animations that give directors an idea of how their characters behave in a space , and how changes to the script might affect the scene , are a key step in movie-making . But previs , as it 's also called in the industry , can take time . “ This is a very lengthy process , ” said Schriber about both previs and storyboarding . “ Some animation films take sometimes up to two years to finalize the story . ”
Disney Research 's Project Cardinal wants to speed up that process by automatically turning scripts into storyboards and then previs films . “ It goes from script to storyboard to animation in real-time , ” said Schriber .
Project Cardinal 's software can ingest scripts and turn them into simple animations , which can then be manually manipulated by filmmakers . Creatives can also integrate voice recordings on the spot , and then preview scenes directly in VR while wearing a headset , giving a vantage point that 's similar to being on scene with the actors of a movie .
Related International VR Experiences to Compete at Paris ' NewImages Festival Andy Bird Out as Head of Walt Disney International ( EXCLUSIVE )
Characters can even be moved around from within a headset , and Disney 's researchers ultimately want to add the ability to do more advanced editing directly in VR as well .
Cardinal is currently being tested with a handful of VR filmmakers , but Schriber readily admitted that there is still a lot of work to be done . For one thing , natural language processing has proven to be challenging . “ Each scriptwriter writes in his or her own way , ” she said .
That 's why Disney Research has developed a simplified markup language for scripts , and is currently advising writers to streamline their work to make it easier for computers to understand , for example by sticking to the present tense .
However , Schriber said that ultimately , Disney Research was looking to turn Cardinal into a more potent tool , which also includes potentially making it available outside of the world of VR filmmakers . Her group had already shown Cardinal to traditional filmmakers , she said : “ They asked us : what about us ? ”

Attention , brides- and grooms-to-be — in February , some of the top wedding specialists will be in the state .
It 's all part of Inaugural Wedding Week Hawaii , hosted by The Modern Honolulu hotel .
The event runs from Friday , Feb. 17 to the 24 , and will showcase local vendors . There will also be live entertainment , fashion shows and workshops .
Among the highlights will be a two-day social affair known as The Experience Feb. 18 and 19 , which will bring a boutique approach to wedding planning . The fashion shows will feature some of Hawaii 's renowned designers , including Kini Zamora , Amos Kotomori and Anne Namba , with pieces from their bridal collections and local bridal salons and their ready-to-wear fashions .

ERIN , Wis. > > Dustin Johnson wrapped up his final day practice round for the U.S. Open just as the sky began to rumble and the horn sounded to stop play at Erin Hills .
The timing couldnt have been better for the worlds No . 1 player , as it has been the past two weeks .
As much as he hates missing cuts , the Memorial two weeks ago was a good time for Johnson to have a weekend off . It allowed him to spend two days in Wisconsin getting to know the longest course in U.S. Open history , realizing that he would be a late arrival to Erin Hills because of some important family matters .
River Jones Johnson , his second son , was born on Monday .
Advertisement
He finds out Thursday whether his game is in shape for Johnson to become the first back-to-back U.S. Open champion in 28 years , but his mood couldnt be better . About the only thing to fear , outside of the thick fescue that frames the fairways at Erin Hills , is the house where he is staying .
It has a double-spiral staircase .
I sit down when I go down the stairs now ,  Johnson said with a smile . I slide down on my butt.
Stairs were the only thing that could stop him earlier this year . A winner of three straight tournaments  against the strongest fields of the year  Johnson slipped in his socks going downstairs to move his car in the rain on the eve of the Masters and bruised his back so badly that he had to withdraw the next day .
He hasnt won in four starts since then , and his game hasnt looked as sharp as it once did . He concedes he lost some momentum .
Even so , he is the betting favorite at the 117th U.S. Open on a course that would appear to suit his game perfectly , especially with more rain Wednesday afternoon and a forecast for occasional storms on Friday and Saturday . The greens are soft enough that Johnson is getting yardages to the hole , knowing his shots wont bounce away too far .
I hope they play it all the way back on every hole ,  he said . Why not ? Its going to be soft . I hope its windy . I hope its long , but it doesnt matter.
Johnson isnt one to feel much pressure  he doesnt show much , anyway  even playing his first major as the No . 1 player in the world .
If anything , the pressure is on the USGA in how they set up the golf course , and the meteorologist to give an accurate forecast of the wind . There are a few holes at Erin Hills where if the tees are all the way back and the wind shifts into the players , some wont be able to reach the fairway or will face blind shots .
Its nerve-wracking , honestly , more than most Open sites ,  USGA executive director Mike Davis said .
Johnson isnt the only long hitter whom Erin Hills favors . Rory McIlroy , who crushed U.S. Open scoring records on a rain-softened course at Congressional in 2011 , was delighted to feel the soft turf under his feet .
Jason Day is starting to turn his game around , finally . Along with his power , Day is an expert with the short game , which should come in handy around the greens that feature shaved slopes instead of dense rough .
Johnson , however , is such an intimidating figure that even Curtis Strange is a little nervous .
Strange , who now works for Fox Sports as the on-course analyst , won the 1989 U.S. Open at Oak Hill to become the first player since Ben Hogan ( 1950-51 ) to win the U.S. Open in consecutive years . Move over , Ben ,  Strange famously said after his second title .
Ive got to tell you , its tailor-made for Dustin Johnson ,  Strange said after his first look at the course .
The Masters ( three times ) and the PGA Championship in stroke play ( twice , by Tiger Woods ) have fewer back-to-back winners than the U.S. Open , but its the major that has gone the longest without a repeat winner .
The closest call for Strange was in 2005 when defending champion Retief Goosen had a three-shot lead at Pinehurst No . 2 . He shot 81 in the final round . Four-time champion Jack Nicklaus never went back-to-back . Neither did Woods .
Youve got to be lucky , have it be the right time ,  Strange said . Dustin is more dominant than anybody who has ever done it back-to-back because of his length and the whole bit . But you still have to do it.
Johnson starts out Thursday morning with the last two U.S. Open champions , Martin Kaymer and Jordan Spieth . Its a comfortable group , especially with Spieth , a close friend , his partner from the Presidents Cup and his regular pro partner in recent years at the AT & T Pebble Beach Pro-Am .
Plus , he has the personality for the U.S. Open . Its a mental test , and Johnsons brain is not very cluttered . Paulina Gretzky gave birth to their second child on Monday in Los Angeles . He flew to Wisconsin on Tuesday and got in 18 holes . He played nine holes Wednesday .
Asked how he handled the range of emotions for such a whirlwind week , Johnson shrugged .
You just do it ,  he said . I wish I had an explanation on how I do it , but I dont . ... But now Ive got to play golf . This is why Im here . Im here to play golf . Im here to compete.
WWE News : Enzo Amore name-drops Mahatma Gandhi , other political leaders ; goes on wild political rant
Enzo Amore name-dropped Mahatma Gandhi and a few other renowned political leaders .
@ johny_payne by Johny Payne News 14 Aug 2017 , 17:00 IST
Enzo Amore goes on a wild political rant !
What 's the story ?
Enzo Amore recently took to social media to post a political rant much like he did last year , name-dropping Mahatma Gandhi , Thomas Jefferson and a few other renowned political leaders .
With most of his speech uttered at a ridiculously high speed , professional wrestling fans have been attempting to decipher what the Certified G actually wanted to convey in his latest political rant . Fans can watch the video below :
Politics UN-u-sual ..... A post shared by Enzo Amore ( @ real1 ) on Aug 9 , 2017 at 6:34pm PDT
In case you did n't know…
Enzo Amore , whose real name is Eric Arndt , has been performing for the WWE since 2012 .
The 30-year-old is widely regarded as one of the best talkers in the professional wrestling business today .
The heart of the matter
Much like most of my fellow pro-wrestling fans , I slowed down the speed of the video , trying my best to jot down Enzo 's political rant , and make sense of the same .
Nevertheless , again , much like most of you guys , I did happen to run into a few phrases that were either inaudible or simply did n't add up in the context of his rant . Regardless , the audible parts of the Bonafide Stud 's latest off-screen promo are as follows-
`` And I get excited even talking about it . Speaking of sides , you 've got your left , you 've got your right . They could be matching up different angles , could be acute , could be obtuse , could be perpendicular . I mean sure , you 've got your Mahatma Gandhi ( and ) you 've got your Ayatollah Khomeini . ''
`` You 've got your Thomas Jeffersons and you 've got your George Jeffersons . And I 've sat way up top , high . Deluxe apartments in the sky and ranting on political jargon -- the best I 've done today -- so without further adieu , allow me to call the performing artist . Please let me get home… if you like I can break this down in layman 's terms , How are you doing ? ”
What 's next ?
Enzo Amore is set to be locked up in a Shark Cage and suspended above the ring for his friend Big Show 's match against his former buddy Big Cass .
The matchup goes down this August 20th at WWE 's SummerSlam pay-per-view .
Author 's take
Bravo , Enzo ! Bravo !
The Certified G sure does know how to rile people up and get a reaction out of them . Well , given the fact that he seems to have genuine backstage heat in the WWE , these self-promotional antics of his may in fact aid him to stay relevant and cement his place in the WWE .
If Flowers is traded , the Giants are going to have to draft a tackle or sign one as a free agent .
Odell Beckham Jr. , who missed most of last season with a broken ankle , and defensive end Olivier Vernon were both at the minicamp . They skipped the minicamp a year ago .
`` I think the big thing for us is our game is very simple — it 's about the ball , it 's about negotiating the ground and it 's really about man whipping man , '' Shurmur said .
The minicamp , which does not entail any hitting , is more about making sure players get to know the new systems , with some throwing and receiving mixed in . The defences can work on stripping the ball .
There was speculation that Shurmur wanted to use the minicamp to see what quarterback Davis Webb could do . The third-round pick did nothing last season , so the Giants really do n't know what they have with their backup to Eli Manning .
`` I do n't think there needs to be any anxiety on his part — get trained up , come on out here , let it rip and mistakes happen in practice and you learn from them , '' Shurmur said . `` I think that 's why you practice , so I think you have to be careful about making a final evaluation on a guy in a three-day period here . He just needs to come out here and get as good as he can be . ''
Most players said they felt they were entering this season with a clean slate .
Cornerback Janoris Jenkins , who was suspended for a game last season after missing a practice , intends to be on his best behaviour this season .
`` I promise y'all that Jackrabbit says it wo n't happen this year what happened last year , '' he said . `` There wo n't be any animosity between players , no disrespecting the coach . There will be none of that . New York Giant football is back . ''
Jenkins also believes fellow cornerback and 2016 first-round draft pick Eli Apple , who also was suspended for a game , will be a different player this season .
`` You have to understand that he was young , '' Jenkins said . `` It 's a clean slate , new coaching staff and for him it 's guys like me that have to push him and help him out because I 've been in the league so long and just help him understand that adversity is going to hit you and when it hits , you 've just got to keep it going . ''
Beckham did not take part in the afternoon practice , but fellow receiver Sterling Shepard said that was a precaution .
`` I 've been with him and have been training with him a bit and , to be honest , I forget that he got hurt sometimes , '' Shepard said .

OTTAWA — The federal government has agreed to give the provinces and territories a 75 % share of the tax revenues from the sale of legalized marijuana , a portion of which will be meted out to cities and towns to help them defray the cost of making pot legal across Canada .
Finance Minister Bill Morneau announced the two-year agreement today after a day-long meeting with his provincial and territorial counterparts .
Morneau says Ottawa will retain the remaining 25 % share to a maximum of $ 100 million a year , with any balance over and above that limit going to the provinces and territories .
Finance Minister Bill Morneau , centre , speaks as he meets with his provincial and territorial counterparts on Parliament Hill in Ottawa on Monday , Dec. 11 , 2017 . THE CANADIAN PRESS/Sean Kilpatrick
The larger share , he added , will allow the provinces to “ fairly deal with their costs and so they can work with municipalities , ” which had been asking for at least a one-third portion of the revenue to help ease the burden of costs like law enforcement .
Morneau said that over the first two years , the federal government expects legalized pot to generate only about $ 400 million in tax revenues , adding that the ministers are scheduled to gather again a year from now to assess how the framework is working .
“ Our expectation is that by keeping prices low , we will be able to get rid of the black market . However , that will happen over time , ” Morneau said during a closing news conference , his counterparts lined up behind him .
Federal Finance Minister Bill Morneau holds a news conference after meeting with his provincial counterparts in Ottawa on Monday , Dec. 11 , 2017 . THE CANADIAN PRESS/Sean Kilpatrick
“ Our estimates suggest that the size of the taxation revenue is roughly ... about up to $ 400 million for the first couple of years . What we 've agreed at our table today is that we need to come back together ; we 're going to come back together in December 2018 to look at how the market 's working , and how the federal government , provinces and municipalities are dealing with this change .
`` Of course , we 'll stay very much on top of this , but after two years it 's time to rethink the approach to make sure we 're getting it right . '' - Bill Morneau
All 14 jurisdictions at the table agreed to the key principles reached at the meeting , Morneau said , calling it a “ very good outcome . ”
The original model put forward by the federal government proposed an even 50-50 split , a plan that was immediately shot down by the provinces , many of which wondered aloud what sort of costs Ottawa would be incurring to deserve such a share .
Earlier today , Ontario Finance Minister Charles Sousa said the federal Liberal government had successfully made the case that it , too , would have costs , but was showing flexibility on related revenue and cost-sharing questions .
After a meeting with his Atlantic counterparts in Halifax , Nova Scotia Premier Stephen McNeil let slip that a two-year deal had been reached , and that provinces would have the ability to include a markup above and beyond existing taxation levels .

THE CANADIAN PRESS/Andrew Vaughan
Ottawa 's initial estimates suggested the total pot of tax revenue from marijuana sales could eventually reach $ 1 billion per year .
“ If there is a markup that a respective province wants to do it would be outside of that taxation model , so that was the flexibility that we as a province were looking for and I would say indeed it was what we were hearing across the country , ” McNeil said .
“ The two-year window will give each of us the time to go back to the table and say this is actually what policing is costing and this is what the education component is . ”

The Federation of Canadian Municipalities has said it wants a third of the revenues earmarked to help municipal governments handle administrative and policing costs , but how that share of the pot is divvied up will be up to the municipalities and their provincial or territorial counterparts .
`` Of course , the provinces will work with their municipalities , but it 's for us to decide what that percentage will be . '' - Quebec Finance Minister Carlos Leitao
The federal government has already committed more than $ 1 billion over five years towards pot legalization in areas like policing and border security .

When asked about the federal push to ensure enough money goes to cities and towns , Quebec Finance Minister Carlos Leitao said each province will do it their own way .
“ Of course , the provinces will work with their municipalities , but it 's for us to decide what that percentage will be , ” he said . “ And every province is different , every city is different , so there is no preconceived amount for the provinces . ”
During the meetings , the ministers also discussed the federal government 's proposed tweaks to the formula behind equalization payments , as well as the three-year review of the Canada Pension Plan . They also explored the state of the global economy and heard a presentation from Bank of Canada governor Stephen Poloz .

Talks also took place on a national strategy to improve the sharing of information on corporate ownership between jurisdictions , a measure designed to clamp down on tax avoidance , tax evasion , money laundering and terrorist financing .
“ We agreed to take concrete steps to make sure that we had knowledge of who owns companies across our country so that we can do a better job at ensuring that we do n't have tax evasion , that we do n't have money laundering , that we do n't have terrorist financing in any part of our country , ” Morneau said .

Long Island fire districts hold elections Tuesday for more than two dozen commissioners ' races and propositions authorizing building renovations , equipment purchases and pension eligibility .
There are about 30 contested commissioners races in both Nassau and Suffolk counties . Commissioners set policies and control budgets that total more than $ 300 million across the Island .
About six fire districts are offering propositions , including referendums related to the state Length of Service Award Program , or LOSAP , which allows volunteer firefighters to receive pension-style benefits . Also among the propositions are an Elmont referendum seeking approval to purchase more than $ 927,000 for radios and communication equipment .

Larry Bull 's eyes were laser focused the moment he stepped into the ring . Though it was only the second battle on the docket , it was the main event and one the rap battle community had been waiting all week to go down .
Illa , a veteran battle rapper , had traveled from Peoria , IL to out-rap the rookie on his home turf .
Although , Bull was fairly new to the rap battle scene , he had been making waves coming off of his fifth battle .
Days before the battle , the two took to social media to host their own impromptu , pre-fight press conference for their followers to see . It ended up getting shared 68 times and racked up 2,200 views just on Facebook .
Minus the flashing lights , reporters and microphones , the two smack-talked back and forth for nearly 15 minutes . They made personal jabs as if they were about to suit up and enter the octagon .
The tension was real and the battle was set .
Local Milwaukee music artists , promoters , DJ 's and fellow battle rappers circled around to witness the battle of the night at the Say Mercy Battle League : Piff or Die 2 event at Rookie 's Lounge on May 19 .
3 Days Before the Battle
Rhythmic shouts and syllabic roars could be heard from outside Bull 's north side Milwaukee home .
He trains for every battle : physically , mentally and lyrically .
He resembled a boxer preparing for a fight , as he posted up on his back porch taking a quick breather from training .
“ I had those bars written three weeks ago , ” Bull said . “ Smart battlers do their homework . ”
For this particular battle , each rapper was allotted three rounds to lyrically demolish their opponent and impress the crowd in-house and online . Most battle rappers , research their opponent by reviewing old battles and stalking social media for anything that could be used as ammo .
As a lyrical artist , Bull said he worked tirelessly on perfecting his bars , schemes , performance and punchlines .
Bull explained how battle rap 's competitive nature made the art Hip-Hop 's steroid-infused cousin . Just like boxing or MMA , there were different styles and strategies that came with it .
“ A part of being a good battler is more than just barking on the guy and rapping at him , ” Bull said .
“ Another thing is defense . ”
Whether it be smirking at a weak bar while staring into his opponent 's soul , or interacting with the crowd , Bull said that when he was not rapping , he was on defense the entire time .
“ When I rap , I want the place popping off , ” Bull said . “ When they rap , I want them to choke . I want them to forget everything they wrote and have them fighting with the crowd . ”
12 Hours Before the Battle
Bull wakes up early before the battle . He meditates and eats light .
The day before he gets a fresh cut and a new pair of shoes , otherwise known as “ the pre-battle essentials . ”
He showers right before the battle to feel relaxed and puts on his battle gear : camo pants and a grey Villeside Entertainment sweatshirt .
He had a scarf wrapped around his wrist . The frayed shadowy floral cloth was a piece from a dress that belonged to his “ mother. ” Though she was not technically his mother , she had walked Bull along the right path when he needed her most .
On the day of the battle , exactly two years earlier , she had passed away . As he was about to step in the arena , he said the battle was dedicated in her honor .
“ This guy does n't know it yet , and he does n't know the meaning behind it , but today , I 'm going to murder this man , ” Bull said like a boxer ready to hop into the ring .
1 Hour Before the Battle
Bull arrives with his entourage with a game face on . He shakes up with league promoters and other battle rappers .
Although , Bull said that he never talked to his competition before the battle . This one was different after Illa walked in actually greeted him .
“ See that 's him trying to get in my head , ” Bull said . “ I 'm not gon na let it happen . ”
5 minutes Before Battle
After an unplanned performance by Milwaukee 's own , MT-Marshall Twins , and a lukewarm first round battle , the two were finally about show and prove .
The Battle
Illa won the coin toss and Bull went first .
He was explosive and had no shame ripping into Illa 's girlfriend and his “ street cred. ” There were a few punchlines and ribs that had the crowd rolling .
Illa came out swinging with a few bars , but it took a turn for the worst after sitting for what felt like an eternity , while he tried to remember his verse . He eventually dug himself out of his own grave .
The second-round Bull went no holds back and straight for the throat . Illa fired back with a solid rebuttal and punchlines , but stumbled over a couple of slip ups .
As the final round approached , Bull had the momentum , but Illa had a chance if he could come back with impeccable punchlines and a flawless round .
Bull put it all on the line for the third round , and the crowd went nuts as people screamed “ FIRE ! ” left and right .
As it was Illa 's turn to step up and finish the battle , he turned to the camera and tapped out .
Illa 's claim shocked the room as he said , “ It 's a wrap , ” and slipped back into the crowd .
The room went ecstatic .
“ Up in this league , either you 're going to do it to the fullest , or you 're not going to do it at all , ” said Great Britton , Say Mercy Battle League owner , into the camera closing out the second battle .
Post Battle
The crowd went on a five-minute intermission .
“ You know who we did this for out here today , we did it for her , ” Bull said as he pounded his chest in a warrior fashion .
Bull 's next battle is scheduled for June 19th against Bum Life YP ( Milwaukee ) .

Actress Brie Larson is getting some grief for her tweet , “ I merely smiled at a TSA agent and he asked for my phone number . To live life as a woman is to live life on the defense . ”
A few folks on Twitter asked why she did n't say anything about the allegations of decades of sexual harassment by Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein , although I think her tweet from last night is pretty clearly a response to that news : ” As always , I stand with the brave survivors of sexual assault and harassment . It 's not your fault . I believe you. ” Also she retweeted several women 's comments about their own experience with sexual harassment , including one asking , “ When did you meet YOUR Harvey Weinstein ? ”
It 's fascinating that all a TSA agent has to do to get some people to come to his defense is offended a Hollywood actress . Whatever you think of Larson , the agent who asked for her phone number during the screening was unprofessional . We hire these guys to keep weapons and hijackers off airplanes , not to pick up women . Asking for the number is arguably an abuse of power if Larson thought she was at risk for additional screening if she refused .
Having said that , the life of a Hollywood starlet probably includes a lot of upsides and some downsides . The upsides are clear ( fame , money , glamour , opportunities , travel , enthusiastic fans ) and one of those downsides is probably going to include the fact that many men who you do not find attractive will want to go out with you . Out of all the ways this TSA agent could have expressed his interest , asking her for a phone number is probably the quickest and most polite . Because Larson did n't elaborate on the story , it seems safe to presume she turned him down and proceeded to her flight . Unprofessional , but minimal harm , minimal foul . ( If there 's more to the story , like the TSA agent following her throughout the airport and continuing to pester her , this is dramatically different . )
Some people in life rarely have to turn down unwanted suitors ; some experience it regularly . Turning down an interested person seems like a low bar for “ living life on defense . ”
The secret to Luc Eymael 's success with Free State Stars is hard work‚ plain and simple‚ says the club 's veteran centreback Rooi Mahamutsa .
Stars lost 1-0 away to Chippa United at Sisa Dukashe Stadium in East London on Saturday‚ but remain in fourth place in the Absa Premiership on the back of six wins‚ three draws and just one defeat going into that game .
Former Orlando Pirates defensive stalwart Mahamutsa would not be drawn on the tactics that flamboyant Belgian coach Eymael has brought to Stars to turn them from surviving by a point in 2016-17 to a top five team this season .
But he did say that Eymael 's workaholic ethic has rubbed off on Stars .
“ Our team has not changed . It 's basically the same players who are there‚ except maybe for one or two‚ ” Mahamutsa said .
“ Obviously‚ look he ( Eymael ) has got his own tactics . Mostly though it 's hard work . That 's all he 's doing .
“ If you do n't put everything that you have you wo n't win games .
“ But if you put everything‚ and focus on what you are doing‚ you will win more and achieve what we are achieving . ”
Mahamutsa said even at a ripe age of 36‚ he has had plenty of new tricks taught to him by Eymael .
“ If you are a player‚ or a teacher or a principal‚ or whatever‚ you still want to study further‚ ” the defender said .
“ You want to go further than your studies . The way he is doing things we do n't say that because we have been long in this game we wo n't listen to him .
“ It 's like‚ I 'm a student‚ he 's the teacher . I have to listen to him .
“ I think that 's the reason why we are in the position we are in at the moment . Because if you listen to instructions you achieve more .
“ Last season we fought relegation and now we are in position four . But we really need to dig deep so that we can finish maybe No.2 . ”
Stars return to action with their Nedbank Cup quarterfinal against Ubuntu Cape Town at Athlone Stadium on March 31 .
Watching online video on your TV is n't easy : Amazon 's Fire TV device does n't have a full-featured YouTube app . Google 's Chromecast adapter does n't have Amazon Video . Anyone wanting to use services from competing companies — say Amazon and Google — necessarily needs to rely on patchwork solutions .
Keeping track of multiple remotes and TV inputs is hard enough . Explaining this to anyone else in your household , or even the occasional house sitter , can be a nightmare . “ If you have a complicated TV setup , you are gon na get support calls , ” quipped Caavo CEO Andrew Einaudi during a recent meeting with Variety .
Einaudi knows first-hand what he is talking about : As a Director of Sling Media , he had a hand in creating and selling the Slingbox , which added one more device to people 's TV setup . Now , Einaudi wants to help people make sense of the jungle of adapters , boxes and cables connected to their TV sets , ironically by adding yet another device : Caavo .
Caavo directly integrates with apps from major media services , and abstracts them from the devices used to run them . Courtesy of Caavo
Caavo is a $ 399 device that essentially combines the apps from multiple streaming devices in a unified interface , complete with the ability to search for content and then have it launch on the device of your choosing . Consumers simply plug their streaming devices , game consoles and more into Caavo instead of their TV , and then use the Caavo remote for anything and everything they want to watch going forward .
Caavo 's remote control comes with an integrated microphone , with the device 's voice recognition being powered by Google 's text-to-speech smarts . Consumers can use this to voice search for a movie , or show , or even an episode of a show , and Caavo automatically fires up the right streaming app on any of the connected devices . Caavo also lets users browse apps like Netflix , Amazon Video and HBO Go on screen , and makes it possible to switch between apps on different devices without having to change the remote control .
Caavo lets users search directly for shows and episodes . Courtesy of Caavo
The device is 4K-capable , offers enough HDMI inputs to connect up to 8 streaming devices or game consoles , and there 's also a bunch of other techs integrated under the hood that could be turned on later to incorporate additional functionality , including Zigbee — a wireless technology often used for internet-connected appliances . At launch , it will integrate directly with a handful of big content apps , but users will be able to browse other apps with the remote as well .
Einaudi co-founded Caavo in 2015 with the late Sling co-founder Blake Krikorian , as well as Ashish Aggarwal , whose work history includes multiple years at audio systems maker Harman International , and Vinod Gopinath , who previously led the online TV guide Shufflr . The group has raised some $ 15 million in funding from DMC , Greylock Partners , Sky and Hearst , and now wants to use the money to slowly roll out Caavo to the masses .
As part of this roll-out Caavo aims to only sell 5000 units of its original device to consumers with high-end home entertainment setups later this year , and then learn from these first customers to eventually build a more affordable version with fewer HDMI inputs .
At launch , Caavo supports up to 8 external HDMI devices . Next year , the company may launch a cheaper version with fewer inputs . Courtesy of Caavo
During a recent demo for Variety , Caavo 's device worked well , save for a few initial hiccups . The Caavo team even showed off some remarkable feats — disconnect one streaming device , and Caavo 's hardware can automatically switch to another device running the same app to keep you watching .
Still , one has to wonder whether the device ultimately is n't too focused on a pain point that may eventually go away on its own . “ We continue to see consolidation efforts , ” acknowledged Einaudi , admitting that even cable boxes are increasingly carrying online video apps . However , he also argued that the core problem wo n't disappear any time soon .
Of course , this does n't mean that others wo n't get the same idea ; one could , for example imagine that TV manufacturers could embrace a similar solution to have their TV sets work better with connected streaming devices . However , Einaudi said that his company was n't interested in licensing its technology . The goal was to build its own hardware , he said .

Pomona , CA — Virun NutraBiosciences video series STATIC premiers Episode 2 on Wednesday , February 15 , 2017 with a review of probiotic and omega supplements on the market , making stinky discoveries . Probiferrin™ is made available through Wholefoods for manufacturers looking for a non-refrigerated , shelf stable probiotic emulsion or powder aimed at increasing the survivability of probiotic bacteria .
“ What do dead bacteria and dead fish have in common ? ” said Virun CEO and Co-founder , Philip Bromley , in an incredibly deep , Darth Vader-esque voice , thanks to Sulfur Hexaflouride . “ They stink ! And this is typical in supplements currently on the market . ”
STATIC™ Episode 2 finds the Virun team in a nationally recognized grocery chain well known for its supplements offerings . A review of several supplements present , however , reveals the shortcomings of many products ; namely a lack of stability on the shelf , resulting in products with inconsistent quality .
“ If you read the fine print on many probiotics , there is a caveat that the billions of probiotics are only claimed as of the date of manufacture , ” Bromley said . “ This means that when the consumer takes the product , there is no guarantee that there are any probiotic bacteria left . We intend to let that proverbial cat out of the bag . It 's the same with Omega EPA DHA . If you ate salmon at a restaurant that tasted like most of the fish oil in soft gels , you would return it to the kitchen immediately . ”
STATIC™ is Virun 's ongoing video series which exposes the inadequacies of the nutrition , beverage and supplement markets . The intent of the series is to educate the masses while entertaining with irreverent humor . Episode 2 and the STATIC series can be viewed at www.virun.com .
Virun aims to make probiotics stable on the shelf and during use , instead of just at the time of manufacture ; which is one of the issues addressed through STATIC . This endeavor is partly made possible through Virun 's release of its new Probiferrin™ , now available to manufacturers through Wholefoods : ( http : //www.wholefoodsmagazine.com/suppliers/new-products-suppliers/probiotic-powder/ ) .
Probiferrin™ is Virun 's patented and patents-pending technology that conjugates probiotics to Lactoferrin . Probiferrin™ is natural , shelf stable without refrigeration , and is available in powder and liquid emulsions containing probiotics of 1 to 50 billion CFU per gram . Probiferrin™ can be added to shots , beverages , multi-serving emulsions or smoothies , and can be further processed into capsules , tablets or chewables . Probiferrin™ allows for a significant increase in the survivability of probiotics at extreme temperatures and also assists with bypassing stomach degradation and targeting the gut mucosa . Probiferrin™ comes in a variety of flavors . Meet Virun and find out more about Probiferrin™ at Ingredient Market Place in Orlando , Florida on April 18-20th , booth number : H28 .

TORONTO -- The Maple Leafs ' first home playoff game of their much-hyped second century belonged to the kids .
And now , so does the lead in their series against the Washington Capitals . Led by their boy band , which in turn was inspired by energizing physical shifts right before two key goals , the Leafs came back from down two to tie and eventually win 4-3 , taking a 2-1 series edge before almost 20,000 fans at the Air Canada Centre .
They killed off a two-minute 5-on-3 and put Alex Ovechkin and the Presidents ' Trophy winners behind the 8-ball in a series that Capscoach Barry Trotz called all-out “ David vs. Goliath ” .
In their first series since 1951 to open with three overtimes — anyone heard of Bill Barilko ? — the winner came from veteran Tyler Bozak on the power-play at 1:37 . Standing in the slot , he redirected Nazem Kadri 's feed from the left boards past Caps goalie Braden Holtby . Lars Eller was in the box , the second penalty drawn by rookie Zach Hyman , one of seven freshmen in the lineup Monday and three to get their first series point .
“ It 's been crazy for them , but this is where you want to be , ” said Leo Komarov of the rookies . “ They 'll get a lot of experience from ( these overtime games ) and it 's cool for everyone .
“ I 'm surprised how much energy they have ( the Leafs are headed towards the 90-game mark ) . It has been a whole season where you come into the locker room with a smile because you have those guys . Their jokes maybe are n't the best , but it 's nice to be around them . ”
Five Leafs have scored their first playoff goal so far in this series with Auston Matthews and William Nylander connecting on Monday .
Leafs goalie Frederik Andersen , after the first two Washington shots found their way in , stood tall on the two-man-short penalty-kill and stretched his right pad to deny Evgeny Kuznetsov , just before Nylander 's last-minute tying goal in the second period .
“ You win games like this , not only tight games , but games where you come back with poise , ” Andersen said . “ It 's just good to be comfortable in these situations . It 's high-pressure , but we 've been able to handle it . We had a nice power play to start this overtime and we want to go in with the attitude to get it done , even though the power-play had n't been running well ( it was about to go 0-for-3 when Bozak scored ) . ”
“ We knew we had fresh ice and the power play and there 's not much more you can ask for at the start of a period , ” said Bozak . “ We 're confident in here , so we 've just got to stick to it . There 's a lot of hockey left and they 're a great team , so we 've got to be ready ( Wednesday for Game 4 ) . ”
There was little to get excited about early when the Caps scored twice before the game was five minutes old .
During 4-on-4 play , Nate Schmidt jumped into the rush to set up Nicklas Backstrom with the defensive pairing of Jake Gardiner and the returning Nikita Zaitsev looking flat- footed .
Then came an opening for Ovechkin to step into his second goal of the series , a full bore drive with no one picking him up .
The Leafs , meawhile , could not bury some fortunate bounces in Washington 's zone and were starting to fire away in desperation . But a take-charge shift by Kadri and Komarov changed the tone of the game , a healthy run by Kadri at Brooks Orpik .
“ There was steam coming out of my ears at that point , ” Kadri said of the growing intensity .
Komarov decided he 'd had enough of KHL buddy Ovechkin throwing his weight around , giving him a jolt and a few whacks for good measure . The next line over the boards was Matthews , Nylander and Hyman , all without a point through about nine periods when OT was factored in . Matthews jumped into the slot where he knocked in his own rebound .
After Kuznetsov made it 3-1 , Kadri banked in a shot off Orpik and Hyman bulldozed two Caps behind the net to clear for Nylander , who buried his own rebound .
“ Once you get into the playoffs , the seeding does n't really matter , ” Matthews said . “ It 's who wants it more . ”
'THERE 'S A LOT OF CRAP GOING ON '
Leo Komarov gave a world-weary smile when asked how much he 's enjoying knocking helmets against Alex Ovechkin every second night .
“ Not at all , ” said the Leafs winger , who bumped with his KHL buddy in the course of eight combined hits for the pair in Game 3 .
At one point , he was sitting on top of the perennial all-star Ovechkin and getting a warning from the officials .
“ I do n't know , there 's a lot of crap going on out there , ” Komarov said . “ I do n't know if I want to talk about it , it seems like every shift is a battle . So you just have to be ready . It 's a new day tomorrow . ”
Ovechkin , whose team will now face further scrutiny about its string of playoff failures , did not hide after the 4-3 overtime loss .
“ It 's on us , we play the game , we 're out there and we have to do better , ” the Washington captain said . “ If we get the lead , we have to manage the puck and manage the game and be more simple out there . ”
The hits as the series has gone on have raised the temperature on both benches .
“ We started pretty slow today , but finished strong , ” Komarov said . “ It 's hockey , you get excited . You ca n't play dirty , but when you have a good hit , it 's fun . They do the same thing . ”
Caps coach Barry Trotz can see where the series has turned so far .
“ We had some looks tonight , but they 're capitalizing on their moments and we 're not . It does n't mean it ca n't happen next game . ”

WASHINGTON : More than 50 female Democratic lawmakers in the U.S. House of Representatives called on Monday for a congressional investigation into allegations by various women of sexual misconduct against President Donald Trump , who has denied the accusations .
“ We can not ignore the multitude of women who have come forward with accusations against Mr. Trump , ” the lawmakers wrote in their letter , though a formal inquiry was unlikely to result because Republicans control the agenda in Congress .
The letter , spearheaded by the Democratic women 's working group , which is composed of all the party 's female members in the House , was signed by 56 lawmakers . It followed a call earlier on Monday by three women who have accused Trump of sexual misconduct for a congressional investigation into his behavior .
The lawmakers ' request for a probe was sent to leaders of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee , the main investigative committee in the House .
Over the past two years , more than a dozen women have accused Trump of making unwanted sexual advances against them in the years before he entered politics . Monday 's letter from the Democrats said there were at least 17 accusers and listed names .
“ The president 's own remarks appear to back up the allegations , ” the letter said , saying Trump had boasted “ that he feels at liberty to perpetrate such conduct against women . ”
“ The president should be allowed to present evidence in his own defense , ” said the lawmakers .
The letter was addressed to oversight panel Chairman Trey Gowdy , a Republican , and top Democrat Elijah Cummings .
Trump last year apologized for talking about groping women in a 2005 tape recording that surfaced weeks before the presidential election , and said he had not done the things he talked about .
More recently , Trump has told allies that the voice on the recording was not his , The New York Times reported recently .
Trump and White House officials have denied the sexual misconduct allegations against him , some of which date back to the 1980s .
“ These false claims , totally disputed in most cases by eyewitness accounts , were addressed at length during last year 's campaign , and the American people voiced their judgment by delivering a decisive victory , ” a White House spokesperson said in a statement on Monday .

A Vernon orchard has a unique way of keeping the birds away from its bumper cherry crop . ( Submitted Photo )
VERNON , B.C . — You usually see them on the side of the road , wiggly arms and tube body bouncing around trying to attract people to a sale .
But a B.C . farmer has found a great use for the air dancers ( or air rangers ) , which have protected his crop from pesky birds .
Peter 's U-Pick Orchard has rescued a bumper crop in large part thanks to the fun inflatables he used to protect his cherries .
“ They are working great compared to previous years where we would have flocks of birds on the early cherries now we just barely see a Jay or two in there compared to flocks of 20-40 at a time , ” said owner Peter Sidorczuk .
“ I got the idea from our neighbour , the Krugers , they tried one last year in their grapes and she said it is working . So I did a bit of research online and bought three of them to try this year and am impressed .
“ It is a great idea . ”

The BX orchard , which opened for the season Saturday , also used a device called bird guard to protect the early cherries . Designed in Australia , the bird guard randomly emits bird distress calls .
Combined with the air dancers , there are plenty of cherries available at the farm this year . Plus the devices have helped keep pesky birds from the Peter 's peaches and apricots .
Peter 's U-Pick , on Rimer Road , is open seven days a week from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m .

The aftershocks of trauma can take many forms , as Katherine ( Katherine Waterston ) learns following the death of her famous husband in “ State Like Sleep , ” writer-director Meredith Danluck 's unsettling first feature . Aided by Christopher Blauvelt 's sumptuous cinematography , this consistently surprising film slinks along with melancholic dreaminess , matching the fugue state that plagues its grief-stricken protagonist . With Michael Shannon and Luke Evans also upending expectations in supporting roles , it 's a confident debut that should reap considerable attention from distributors , and opportunities for Danluck , following its premiere at this year 's Tribeca Film Festival .
“ Without stories , the truth is too random , ” opines Danish actor Stefan ( Michiel Huisman ) during a TV interview at the start of “ State Like Sleep. ” Though the thespian comes off as full of himself ( and also something decidedly odorous ) , it 's an insight that defines Danluck 's tale . Via eerie shots through Stefan and wife Katherine 's messy Brussels flat , as well as oblique glimpses of a gunshot and blood pooling around Stefan 's head , the subsequent drama is set in motion . Before audiences can settle in , however , the film leaps forward a year in time , to find Katherine — a photographer who has since abandoned her home — receiving news that her mother ( Mary Kay Place ) is in Denmark , and in the hospital . Thus , Katherine 's long-delayed return trip to the scene of the crime begins .
With a look of perpetual misery plastered across her face , Katherine is soon dealing with not only her mother 's fragile brain-related condition , but also her nasty mother-in-law Anneke ( Julie Kahner ) , who resents Katherine for stealing away the affections of her beloved boy . Back in the residence she fled , Katherine is compelled to confront the marital messiness that immediately preceded Stefan 's death , including a tabloid scandal involving leaked pictures of him with a mysterious woman . Wracked by questions about Stefan 's fidelity , as well as whether foul play was to blame for his demise , Katherine transforms herself into an amateur sleuth , trawling the darker corners of Brussels — and her memory — to solve what she suspects may be a whodunit .
That endeavor leads Katherineto an underground nightclub run by Emile ( Evans ) , a live-wire who was Stefan 's best friend since childhood ( unbeknownst to Katherine ) , and who attempts to bed her by tricking her into snorting heroin . While eying Emile as a potential suspect , she strikes up an unlikely rapport with Edward ( Shannon ) , a hotel neighbor who first introduces himself by drunkenly trying to enter her room . In “ Rear Window ” fashion , Katherine uses her camera to watch Edward through their adjacent windows . Yet despite a guilelessness that verges on bluntness , Edward is anything but a Raymond Burr-ish villain . Before long , their shared feelings of dislocation and longing — for connection , understanding , and relief from their loneliness — draws them into a tentative romance .
Using Waterston 's changing hairstyle as a way to identify where different scenes fit in the film 's chronology , Danluck cross-cuts between past and present with stream-of-consciousness fluidity , creating a hypnotic mood in harmony with her hazy metropolitan milieu and Katherine 's dazed-and-confused headspace . To that end , “ State Like Sleep ” is bolstered by Jeff Wingo and David Mcilwain 's piano-and-electronica score , and moreover , by DP Blauvelt 's rapturous work . His woozy imagery is awash in reflections and light flares , filtered through streaky windows and translucent barriers , and marked by unexpected compositions that lend the action a striking , disorienting edginess .
Waterston embodies Katherine as a lost soul consumed by delusional sorrow , and around the edges of her morose expressions , one can spy the woman 's marrow-deep desperation . Just as assured are Evans and Shannon , both of whom initially come across as neo-noir archetypes — the volatile underworld scumbag and the charming but untrustworthy stranger , respectively — and then skillfully develop surprising angles to their characters . Seething with irrepressible resentment , Khaner steals every scene she 's in , including a climax that plays like a startling slap to a slumbering face .
ANN ARBOR ( AP )  Jabrill Peppers perhaps played out of position at Michigan last season , lining up as a linebacker even though he seemed most suited to play safety in the NFL .
He made enough plays to become a Heisman Trophy finalist as a junior and to determine he was ready to play in the league .
Timing might work against Peppers , though , because hes projected to be taken after LSUs Jamal Davis and Ohio States Malik Hooker . Those two safeties are expected to be among the top selections next week , and no one appears to be sure when Peppers will be taken .
FIVE THOUGHTS ON WHETHER PEPPERS SHOULD BE DRAFTED BY LIONS

Its unfortunate that hes coming out in a year where there are so many good safeties ,  NFL draft consultant and former Dallas Cowboys general manager Gil Brandt said . Under normal conditions , hed probably be the No . 1 safety , but the Ohio State and the LSU guys are so good .
Hes a tremendous football player . He finds a way to makes things happen . Even though he only had one interception at Michigan , he finds a way to make a big play , whether its a sack off a blitz or on a punt return.
Brandt believes Peppers is talented enough to potentially be drafted in the middle of the first round , but wont be surprised if hes available early in the second round . Even though Peppers was pushed out of his comfort zone last season , Brandt does not think it affected his value to NFL teams .
The only thing that hurts him a little bit is he doesnt have very good hands ,  Brandt said . At pro day , he dropped about three passes.
Bleacher Report NFL analyst Chris Simms said Peppers was the most overrated ,  prospect in the draft last week and the proud player fired back the next day on Twitter .
I played out of position ( LB ( at ) 200lbs ) pounds , and still became an American ,  Peppers tweeted . How many players can/ARE WILLING to do that for their team ? 
The 5-foot-11 , 213-pound Peppers declined an interview Saturday while walking up the tunnel out of Michigan Stadium after the schools spring game . But he acknowledged last month that it is fair to question where he will play in the league because there isnt a lot of tape of him at safety . Peppers was primarily used as a nickel cornerback as a sophomore in 2015 .
Coach Jim Harbaugh had him return punts and kickoffs and play on offense , putting him in as a wildcat quarterback , running back and wide receiver .
Ive had one team tell me they want me to play linebacker ,  Peppers said in March at Michigans pro day . One team told me they thought I should play offense . Other than that its , youre a safety. ... No ones come into a room and said , Jabrill , we dont know what to do with you. 
Speed , it seems , will be an asset for Peppers .
He ran a 4.46 40-yard dash at the scouting combine , showing off the form that helped him in high school become a New Jersey state champion in track . In games , whether returning a punt for a touchdown or a fumble on a 2-point conversion , he simply looked like a blur at times .
Peppers didnt play in Michigans 33-32 loss to Florida State in the Orange Bowl because of an injured left hamstring , but has proven hes healthy during a string of visits with NFL teams .
He led a team stacked with NFL-caliber players with 16 tackles for losses last season and ranked third with 72 tackles . He also had four sacks , one interception and forced a fumble . On offense , Peppers had 27 carries for 167 yards , caught two passes and scored three touchdowns . He returned a punt for a score in a win over Colorado , averaged a Big Ten-best 14.8 yards on punt returns , and gained 26 yards per kickoff return .
He won the Hornung Award as the nations most versatile college football player , and the Lott Trophy , which honors a defensive player for character and performance .
Whatever team takes me , its going to be a steal ,  Peppers said . I dont care what the draft experts  and things like that  what they have to say . I only care about what these GMs and coaches think about me . I just need the opportunity . Thats it .
I didnt play safety , but Im going to be a safety.
ISLAMABAD - The Supreme Court on Wednesday said it will not tolerate hurdles in the way of the investigation being carried out by a team of the offshore business dealings of the prime minister 's family .
The three-judge bench formed for the implementation of Panama case judgement reserved judgment on Hussain Nawaz petition regarding video recording of witnesses ' statement .
The court directed the Attorney General for Pakistan ( AGP ) to file reply on the JIT objections that the state institutions were creating hurdles in their way .
“ Creating obstacles and impediments are just like to subvert the apex court judgment [ delivered on April 20 in Panama Papers case ] , ” head of the bench , Justice Ejaz Afzal said during the hearing .
“ We have directed the JIT ( joint investigation team ) to investigate , therefore , if someone did this [ created obstructions ] then he is not subverting the JIT but the court order , ” he remarked . The JIT is bound to complete the investigation within 60 days , he reiterated .
On the issue of video recording of witness statements , AGP Ashtar Ausaf told the bench that he was in complete agreement with the arguments of petitioner 's counsel Khawaja Haris .
He said that the JIT had been doing video recording on its own , without getting court permission . Also , he said that video recording has a negative psychological affect on witnesses .
Justice Ijazul Ahsan remarked that the video recording instead of causing harm would protect the witnesses .
Earlier , Khawaja Haris , representing PM 's son Hussain Nawaz , contended that the video recording seemed to be sinister rather keeping accurate transcription .
He argued that when the law ( CrPc 1898 ) did not require a witness to sign on the statement given to the investigative officer then why there should be camera on their face to record his statement .
The lawyer said that if a witness photograph could be leaked to the social media once , it could happen again . He asked what was the guarantee that leak would not happen again .
Haris said that “ tomorrow ( Thursday ) ” Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif was going to appear before the JIT and what was the guarantee that his picture would not be leaked .
If that happens , who will be responsible as it would damage the image of the country in the whole world .
The lawyer said that the JIT has said about the Hussain photo leak that the person responsible for it has been sent back to their parent department .
“ No one can be judged for his own cause , ” he said , and demanded that the judicial commission should be constituted to probe the leaking of Hussain Nawaz ' photo to the media .
Haris also submitted a rejoinder to the JIT 's reply on Hussain Nawaz application .
He said that it was confession on the part of the JIT that they could not control the leak .
The counsel questioned whether the video recording of witness statement was permissible under the law .
He pointed out that under Section 161 ( 1 ) of CrPC 1898 a police officer might examine orally any person supposed to be acquainted with the facts and circumstances of the case , while in Section 161 ( 3 ) the police officer may reduce into writing any statement made to him in the course of examination .
Haris said that under Section 162 of CrPC the statement to the police not to be signed and used in evidence . He said that there was a rationale behind the century-old developed law .
The lawyer stated that when under Section 162 of CrPC the statement could not be signed then why the JIT was doing video recording . He argued that the JIT was given mandate to investigate in accordance with the judgment of the Supreme Court , but no procedure was prescribed .
The implementation bench subsequently passed an order in this regard that the JIT would exercise power under CrPc , the NAB and the FIA Act .
Haris contended that according to it , the JIT has to exercise power under the CrPC .
Justice Ejaz said that the status of video recording of the statement would remain as that of oral statement and the video could not be produced as substantive evidence under Section 162 of CrPC and the Section 151 of Qanoon-e-Shahadat , and it is also not for corroboration . It could only be used to confront the witness .
“ Nothing terrible lies in the video recording , ” Justice Ejaz said . He said that if the technology was used for accuracy then what was bad about it .
Haris said that let the legislature decide about the accuracy and the means to secure it , and the Supreme Court could not make the law on video recording .
It would affect the freedom of witness , adding the witness has to be unhampered in stating what he has to say , he added .
Hussain 's counsel raised objection that if the video recording could not be used as substantive evidence then why it was needed in the first place . The JIT was not conferred power for video recording of statement , he held .
Haris referred the judgments of the Supreme Court of Pakistan and Indian courts and also the Privy Council . He said that in India they had amended the law to permit video recording , but in Pakistan the legislature had not done so .
The lawyer said the video recording could not be permissible unless the legislature make law in this regard .
Justice Ejaz again said that the video recording could not be used in the court , adding what would be used was the written statement of the witness .
Haris said that there would be psychological affect on the witness of the video recording . He questioned what would happen if the video recording was tampered with .
Before the conclusion of the case , Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf spokesman Fawad Chaudhry at the rostrum said he had filed an application regarding the alleged derogatory campaign against the higher judiciary .
Fawad said that he had brought media comments into the notice of court .
The bench observed that it was in their knowledge that what comments were being made on media .
“ We have been hearing comments through newspapers , ” Justice Ejaz said , and added that the media had already commented over judgments and “ we know about the campaign ” . “ But we are proceeding in accordance with law and we do n't care who says what , ” he added .
Justice Ejaz further said that they believed that comments even negative should have some solid substance .
Justice Ijazul Ahsan observed that they would look into it as data was being collected regarding the media comments over the matter . “ Once we are done with this case then we would sort it out , ” he said .
The AGP stated that he has been reiterating that the apex court should restrain the politicians and parties concerned in the matter in hand from giving comments over the case in media .
At this , Justice Azmat asked the attorney general why he does not advise the government and its ministers against making comments on the court proceedings .

The mayor of Surrey says she will ask the federal government for $ 10 million in funding for anti-gang programs in British Columbia 's fastest-growing city , where people are dealing with “ emotional upheaval ” after recent acts of gun violence .
Linda Hepner said Tuesday the money would be spent over five years after a task force aimed at preventing gang violence issued a report with six recommendations , including an expanded gang exit and outreach program that has been led by a combined police and border services unit for about 18 months in the province .
“ We first piloted it and it 's the only one in the country that I know of , ” Hepner said .
“ In less than two years , it 's actually worked with more than 100 people that are in gangs . They 've actually now got a chance to be part of a gang free future but that is in jeopardy because we need funding for that . ”
Hepner said “ dozens ” of people have left gangs because of the program , which the province has committed to funding until the end of the year .
Surrey residents have held anti-violence rallies calling for action , including more RCMP officers , after two teenage boys were recently found shot to death on a rural road and a father and hockey coach was gunned down outside a home .
The task force , which Hepner led after launching it last October , also recommended more police enforcement and the launch of an initiative that would allow nightclubs and other businesses to ban alleged gangsters .
The expansion of early intervention programs to deter children from entering the gang lifestyle was among the recommendations , and Hepner said some kids lured into gangs are as young as 10 and come from a range of backgrounds .
“ The profile is so different in British Columbia than anywhere else in North America , ” she said . “ They could be affluent , they could be poor , they could be middle income . They run the gamut here . ”
Hepner said youths are joining gangs for difference reasons .
“ Generally , those that are more affluent are out for glory and glamour , ” she said . “ The ones that are in more vulnerable economic circumstances have often been subject to trauma . Lots of them are subject to seeing domestic abuse , some of them not feeling that they fit in culturally and do n't feel part of the community . ”
Other recommendations include the development of strategies to help at-risk children and their families , as well as stronger neighbourhood-based and culturally appropriate programs .
The mayor is also calling for more funding from the provincial government .
The Public Safety Ministry announced $ 1.12 million in funding Tuesday to expand an anti-bullying program based in schools called Expect Respect and a Safe Education , or ERASE , in communities across the province where gang-affiliated behaviours have been identified . It said the strategy is designed to prevent , identify and stop harmful behaviours , whether they occur in school or online .
The task force in Surrey included citizens , people from the business community , police and a local member of Parliament . It said RCMP statistics suggest gang members involved in conflicts between 2014 and 2016 were age 23 on average and had committed their first criminal offence at the average age of 16 .

CHONBURI , Thailand - The most senior US officer to visit Thailand since a 2014 coup emphasised the importance of restoring democracy on Tuesday as he launched the annual Cobra Gold military exercise .
The United States scaled down its presence at Asia 's largest annual multinational military exercise as one of the former US administration 's steps to pressure the junta .
With ties improving even before President Donald Trump took office , activists had voiced concern that Washington would put less focus on democratic change in a region where it faces an increasingly forceful China .
`` We look forward to Thailand 's re-emergence as a flourishing democracy because we need Thailand to be a strong and stable partner , '' said Admiral Harry Harris , head of US Pacific Command , which covers about half the earth 's surface . `` We need Thailand to get back to being the regional and global leader that it always has been . ''
Harris later met Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha in Bangkok . Speaking after the weekly cabinet meeting , the junta leader said the United States accepted Thailand 's strategic plans and just wanted to see fair and honest elections .
`` Our politics is our business , and we must proceed towards our democracy . Today we 're marching towards reconciliation , '' Prayuth told reporters , referring to Thai political rivalry .
Harris 's attendance at Cobra Gold was planned before the inauguration of Trump , whose policy moves on Asia are closely watched after signals of potential confrontation with China over trade and territory .
In the face of the US measures to push for democracy , Thailand has strengthened military cooperation with China .
New York-based Human Rights Watch said the change in relations with Thailand marked a worrisome shift given the military 's grip on power and the arrests of activists and opponents of army rule .
`` It appears Pentagon policymakers are intent on using Cobra Gold as a way to reboot US military engagement with their Thai counterparts , '' wrote John Sifton of the advocacy group in an opinion piece that first appeared in the Washington Post .
The Thai junta held a referendum last year on a constitution to allow a general election . It is expected next year .
The military government is also due to start meetings with political groups on national reconciliation ahead of the election . Parties have welcomed the idea , but questioned whether the generals can be fair .
Thailand has hosted the Cobra Gold war games since they began in 1982 . This year 's event will be attended by more than 8,300 personnel from 29 countries . Among them will be about 3,600 from the United States .
More than half a million pounds worth of damage has been caused by a series of fires in Harrogate , says the officer leading an investigation into the 'mindless and dangerous ' offences .
At Cow Dyke Farm two cases of arson and criminal have been confirmed , with further fires since occurring out at Know Hill Farm and most recently on farmland near Cow Dyke Bridge on Wednesday , January 31 .
DC Paul Smith of the Harrogate Investigation Hub is leading North Yorkshire Police 's efforts and has urged for witnesses to come forward and help bring those responsible to face the 'full force of the law ' .
He said : “ We urge anyone who has witnessed suspicious activity in the area , or who has seen the fires , to get in touch .
“ The total cost of the damage caused by the fires is more than five hundred thousand pounds . But fires can also cost lives . The people causing these fires are putting not only others , but themselves in grave danger .
“ These crimes are mindless , dangerous and can have catastrophic consequences . We are doing all we can to find out who is responsible , and when we do we will ensure they face the full force of the law . ”
A derelict bungalow was set on fire on the Cow Dyke Farm site last year , while the most recent incident in January saw 70 per cent of a derelict barn damaged .
Firefighters from both Harrogate and Boroughbridge responded to the most recent fire near Cow Dyke Bridge , which was initially reported as a barn on fire . However it was found a small amount of rubbish had been set on fire inside a shed .
The blaze however destroyed the shed , spreading to a nearby hedge . Crews were able to extinguish it with a hose reel jet .
A spokesperson for North Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service said : `` We have been to a number of deliberate fires in the area of Cowdyke farm , and are working alongside North Yorkshire Police and other agencies .
`` We would advise members of the public to report any suspicious behaviour or activity to North Yorkshire Police , and to ensure that outbuildings and properties are secure . ''

WYNNEWOOD , Pa. ( AP )  Two teachers at a Quaker school outside Philadelphia have been suspended over fallout from a Palestinian speaker 's invitation to a school club they supervised .
The controversy is highlighting an issue for many Quaker schools : While the American Friends Service Committee supports putting economic pressure on Israel to end the occupation of Palestinian territories , many students at Quaker schools are Jewish .
Teachers Ariel Eure and Layla Helwa were put on administrative leave Monday from Friends ' Central School in Wynnewood , a lawyer representing the two women told the Philadelphia Inquirer ( http : //bit.ly/2lfT6J8 ) .
The lawyer , Mark Schwartz , said the teachers were told they were suspended for disobeying a supervisor and for having a `` single-minded approach to a complicated issue for the community . ''

The teachers supervised the school 's Peace and Equality in Palestine club , and invited Swarthmore College professor and Quaker Sa'ed Atshan to speak last week at the club .
Some parents complained about Atshan 's involvement in a movement that advocates punitive measures against Israel , and school leaders canceled his speech .
The administration says the teachers are on paid leave while an extensive review is conducted .
`` As a Quaker school , we have long-standing expectations for all members of our community  especially for our teachers , who have the responsibility of guiding young minds , '' it said . `` There are very real concerns about the conduct of Ariel Eure and Layla Helwa for their disregard of our guiding testimonies , which include community , peace , and integrity . ''
About 65 students and Eure and Helwa walked out of a school meeting to protest the speech 's cancellation . The teachers also attended a student meeting where the students discussed their concerns . Afterward , some students marched with signs reading `` My voice will not be silenced '' and `` Bring back my speaker . ''

Theis-Sponsored Bill Package Would Eliminate Automobile No-Fault Insurance
February 2 , 2018
A local lawmaker is co-sponsoring a new auto insurance reform bill .
Michigan residents over recent years have consistently been at or near the top of the list for paying the most for auto insurance . Republican State Representative Lana Theis of Brighton Township is working with five others in the House on the package . Theis , who chairs the House Insurance Committee , says the new bill package would eliminate the no-fault system and move Michigan to a tort system similar to that which 40 other states are currently using . Theis says the legislation would lower costs for drivers and bring noticeable savings .
“ I 'm just excited about the opportunity to solve a very significant problem , ” Theis told WHMI . “ This is a problem that 's been going on for decades . This is the single thing that we can do for Michigan where we can save our citizens thousands of dollars , not just $ 100 or $ 50 . If you could change somebody 's pocketbook $ 1,000 a year , that 's a major deal . ”
Theis said that drivers would still be required to have insurance but this would provide greater choice and flexibility by eliminating the requirement to buy unlimited medical coverage . Accident victims under the legislation would have the ability to sue drivers found to be at-fault for economic and non-economic damages like pain and suffering . Theis pointed at savings around 35 % in other states that have abandoned no-fault insurance and said that Michigan drivers could see that number here grow even higher . The bill package will be formally read into the record next week .
This marks the second attempt to get auto insurance reform legislation through the GOP controlled House . House Bill 5013 , sponsored by Theis , was voted down 45-63 after hours of behind-the-scenes arm twisting and an extensive floor debate last November . Critics countered that the measure would gut quality benefits for the injured , shift costs to Medicaid and not stop insurers ' discriminatory practices by which urban drivers pay more due to factors that have nothing to do with their driving history . They also contended that the rate reductions would not be guaranteed . ( MK/JM )

As well as fundraising events and use of volunteer days , staff and members of the society will have the opportunity to assist in raising awareness of the work the trust undertakes .
A senior manager for the Newbury Building Society , Jane Bosher , said : “ We 're delighted to announce our new partnership with Newbury District Cancer Care Trust .
“ This is a fantastic charity providing support and information to local people who have been diagnosed .
“ The support can range from being there to listen to family 's worries and concerns , to making sure that people have a way of getting to their appointments . ”
NDCCT chairman , David Ball , said : “ We 're delighted the Newbury and Thatcham branches of Newbury Building Society have announced their support .
“ As a local charity supporting local people we are entirely dependent upon the generosity of the local community for our income . ”
He added : “ We have embarked on a major project – The Rosemary Appeal – to fund the construction of a new dialysis and cancer care centre at the West Berkshire Hospital .
“ Newbury Building Society has been supportive of The Rosemary Appeal and has set up the necessary account for donations . ”
The Newbury and Thatcham branches of the building society have a number of volunteering and fundraising events planned , including selling calendars and helping out at the car boot sale stall run for the charity .

Charleston product signs with Gamecocks
COLUMBIA , S.C. – South Carolina head women 's basketball coach Dawn Staley announced that Elysa Wesolek ( pronounced uh-LIS-uh WES-uh-lick ) has signed a financial aid agreement to attend the University and play for the Gamecocks . Initially signing a National Letter of Intent to play at Western Kentucky , Wesolek re-opened her recruitment following a coaching change at that institution . Her eligibility for 2018-19 is pending her enrollment at the University of South Carolina .
“ Elysa is a dynamic player who can play multiple spots on the floor , ” Staley said . “ Her ability to rebound and shoot the ball from both the paint and the perimeter with complement our team . What excites us equally is that Elysa is a proven winner with three state championships under her belt ; and we look forward to her bringing that championship mindset to Gamecock Nation . ”
A 6-foot-1 forward out of Charleston , S.C. , Wesolek helped Northwood Academy to three 3A state championships . Scoring over 1,000 points in her career , she has earned South Carolina Independent School Association ( SCISA ) 3A Player of the Year honors , first-team All-Lowcountry recognition and was a three-time SCISA All-State selection . As a senior , she posted 19.5 points and 9.2 rebounds per game .
Wesolek joins point guard Destanni Henderson ( Lehigh Acres , Fla. ) and forward Victaria Saxton ( Rome , Ga./Model HS ) in Staley 's 2018 signing class .
Carolina Panthers training camp is over for this year and practices will now become private affairs in the fields behind Bank of America stadium as the team gears up for its remaining preseason games .
There 's a lot to talk about when it comes to camp , but we will widdle it down to just a few .
Here are five awards from training camp at Wofford .
Offensive MVP – WR Devin Funchess
Funchess came into the league making plays . His rookie season he caught 31 passes for 473 yards and five touchdowns . Last year was a disappointment for him statistically , but all signs point to him skyrocketing in 2017 . At camp , Funchess made more plays than his counterpart Kelvin Benjamin , and altogether showed more ability against second year cornerbacks Daryl Worley and James Bradberry .
Working with the first-team offense , there was no receiver Derek Anderson depended more on than Funchess . With Benjamin more of a red zone target and Russell Shepard being new to the offense , Funchess was effectively the team 's true number one receiver .

Allen Park — When the Detroit Lions drafted A'Shawn Robinson in the second round last year , most saw the selection as a value pick , but there were understandable questions about the defensive tackle 's scheme fit .
No one is asking those questions anymore .
After an impressive rookie season , which saw Robinson go from a rotational piece to a starter the final four games , he 's on track to have an even bigger impact his sophomore campaign . He flashed his massive potential in the preseason opener , despite playing just 17 snaps .
“ You know , it is kind of hard to believe with a guy that big , that strong , that he 's stronger , ” coach Jim Caldwell said . “ He had a pretty solid game the other day and did some of the things he 's accustomed to doing . He put pressure on the quarterback by knocking his guy back into the pocket . ”

During the second series of the game , Robinson batted down a pass on second down — a skill he exhibited a knack for as a rookie — and bullied guard Jack Mewhort on third down , driving the Colts offensive lineman deep into the pocket and forcing the quarterback to tuck the ball and scramble , resulting in a sack for teammate Alex Barrett .
Robinson is making it look easy , but the transition to Detroit 's scheme — which centers around an aggressive , attacking front — from the read-and-react style he played at Alabama did n't come easy . Thankfully , he had Haloti Ngata , a veteran with an impressive resume , willing to help bring him along .
“ He 's been very important , ” Robinson said . “ Working with him , him helping me with my technique , getting off the ball and stuff , making sure my pad level is down and everything , it 's been really cool . ”
Ngata , one of the best interior lineman of this era , had made a similar schematic switch during his career . And after a year mentoring Robinson , Ngata could see the results entering the youngster 's second season .
“ A lot of it I think is just confidence , ” Ngata said . “ A'Shawn , coming out here , his offseason was great . You can see his confidence is there . ”
The ceiling for Robinson is tantalizing . He 's only 22 years old and is likely only scratching the surface on his abilities . That should be a scary thought for opposing offenses .
“ All my game is the next step , honestly , ” Robinson said . “ ( I 'm ) working on getting better in the run , and of course getting after the quarterback play in and play out . It 's getting off those blocks , making those plays . ”
Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh implored lawmakers to bridge the gap between the haves and have-nots when it comes to access to legal representation as he spoke during a congressional hearing Wednesday on behalf of Legal Services Corporation . ( Photo : Facebook )
Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh implored lawmakers to bridge the gap between the haves and have-nots when it comes to access to legal representation as he spoke during a congressional hearing Wednesday on behalf of Legal Services Corporation .
Harbaugh , a member of LSC 's leadership council , was one of nine speakers discussing the LSC 's latest report : The Justice Gap : Measuring the Unmet Civil League Needs of Low-Income Americans .
“ Many of you are probably wondering why a football coach is doing an event like this , ” Harbaugh said in his opening remarks at the hearing . “ I may be a football coach , but I am an American first and foremost and all Americans should care about equal access to justice .
“ It 's not just Michigan Go Blue , it 's Go Red , White and Blue . ”
Joseph Kennedy III , a U.S . Congressman from Massachusetts , was among the speakers , most of whom acknowledged Harbaugh 's presence at the hearing .
“ Thank you for lending your voice to this cause , ” Kennedy said to Harbaugh . “ And as my in-laws would proudly say , ‘ Go Blue'. ” Kennedy 's in-laws , Jim and Marta Birchfield , grew up in Ann Arbor .
Harriett Miers , former White House counsel , thanked Harbaugh in her opening remarks saying , “ Your voice does make a difference . ”
Harbaugh shared during the hearing his admiration of lawyers and added how he 's a big fan of Judge Judy and attended a taping of her television show . That drew laughs from the group .
In discussing the inequalities in access to legal representation , Harbaugh made a football analogy , saying he believes in team and said he also thinks “ of our country as a team . ”
“ Fairness on a football team is probably what you strive for the most , ” he said . “ You want to be fair to everyone on the team , and it would be like if you gave 20 percent of the team helmets . The rest of the team does n't get helmets , you do n't get protection . Then we 'll see what happens . ”
He stressed the lack of fairness for low-income individuals who do n't have the funds for proper legal representation .
“ I learned how many people who are being left out of the justice system because they ca n't get a lawyer , ” Harbaugh said . “ Did n't seem fair then and does n't seem now . That 's why I became a member of LSC 's leadership council and why I 'm here today . The issue is about fairness , fundamental fairness , because as I see it , if you have money , you have access to justice . If you do n't have money , you have less access to our justice system , and that 's not the way it should work . ”

A privately-educated model who glassed a woman and slapped a police officer was spared jail to volunteer at an animal charity in South Africa .
Sophia Brogan-Higgins , 22 , smashed a glass into Justina Liutkute 's forehead at The Box Soho nightclub , London , where guests have included Prince Harry , Kate Moss , Emma Watson and Keira Knightley .
Brogan-Higgins , who broke her false nails during the incident , then kicked and slapped PC Alistair Skelton before she was dragged away from the scene at 4am on July 21 .
The former private schoolgirl - educated at £12,190-a-term St Edward 's School in Oxford - lives in an eight-bed detached home worth £6.75m in Wandsworth , with her wealthy parents William and Joanna Brogan-Higgins .
Shortly after her arrest , she told police she would not answer questions until her dad arrived .
Judge Susan Baines handed Brogan-Higgins a 20-week suspended sentence after her defence barrister Andrew Moxon told a court his client was planning to fly to Cape Town , South Africa , to work for an animal charity .
The case comes just two months after another young woman was spared a custodial sentence by a judge who ruled she was `` too clever for jail '' .
( Image : central news )
Lavinia Woodward - an Oxford medical student who hoped to become a surgeon - admitted stabbing her Tinder lover Thomas Fairclough but escaped with a suspended sentence .
Sentencing Brogan-Higgins , Judge Baines said : `` It is very sad to see someone like you in front of a court for the offences that I heard about at the trial .
`` Obviously I had the ability to see the CCTV footage and it was of great concern what I saw because you were completely out of control on the night .
`` The situation for people who were simply doing their jobs is unacceptable - your behaviour was simply not acceptable .
`` I am obviously prepared to accept that you have obvious mental health issues , had the court found that the assault was a deliberate , intentional assault you would be going straight to prison because she could have been injured very seriously .
`` I am going to impose a custodial sentence , 20 weeks suspended for a year .
`` I can tell from what I have read about you that you are an intelligent person , now I hope that you reflect on your behaviour because it is very serious . ''
( Image : central news )
Mr Moxon said : `` She is due to do that work for two and a half weeks and her family will be going out to South Africa to join her , her father works in Dubai and they felt this was an opportunity for them all to meet halfway .
`` If she was required to do an RAR [ Rehabilitation Activity Requirement ] , the issue would be that tag would n't work in South Africa .
`` What I am being told by the probation officer is that if you impose this order on her then it would begin immediately and she would expect to do an induction course within the next three days . ''
The suspended sentence allowed Brogan-Higgins to jet off to Cape Town .
The judge added : `` I hope the trip to South Africa goes really well and sets you off on a good path . ''

Brogan-Higgins was convicted of assaulting Ms Liutkute and PC Skelton after a short trial at Hammersmith Magistrates ' Court last month .
Ms Liutkute had told the model she `` was not allowed in a certain VIP area '' at the Box Nightclub .
Brogan-Higgins told the security guard : `` B * * * * , you do n't know how to do your job , do n't touch me because it 's like sexual harassment . ''
Ms Liutkute , 33 , was escorting Brogan-Higgins out of the club when the clubber punched her in the face holding a glass .
In a statement , she said : `` The lady tried to throw a punch at my face with the hand that she was holding the glass in .
`` She thrusted it with real force . ''
( Image : Central News )
Ms Liutkute received first aid for a two-inch wound above her left eye and took two weeks off work after she was stitched up in hospital .
Brogan-Higgins was then detained by three male security guards and taken into a holding room where she continued to lash out .
Prosecutor Umar Ali said : `` PC Skelton located Higgins within the club and asked Higgins to give an account of what happened .
`` Higgins refused to make any comment until her dad arrived .
`` PC Skelton noticed dried blood on Higgins hands and left forearm .
`` Higgins would not respond as to where the marks had come from
`` Higgins then accused PC Skelton of being rude to her .
`` PC Skelton then noticed Higgins picks up a packet of wet wipes and took one from the packet .
`` Suspecting Higgins might try to wipe off the areas of dried blood PC Skelton took hold of her forearms to stop her .
`` Higgins then started struggling and without warning kicked PC Skelton in the stomach followed by a slap to his face . ''
( Image : central news )
PC Skelton told the court : `` She kicked me , she struck me in the lower abdomen .
`` What I remember is I grabbed hold of her leg and then she struck me in the face with her right hand in a slapping motion . ''
PC Skelton 's body camera filmed Brogan-Higgins kicking and screaming on the floor and telling officers `` you 're hurting me '' as she was arrested .
The officer said : `` She picked up a wipe , she 's holding it in front of her body , she has blood on her hands and on her arms so I thought it was most likely what was going to happen .
`` My opinion was that she was trying to wipe her hands and destroy what could be forensic evidence . ''
Brogan-Higgins denied assaulting Ms Liutkute and told the court : `` All I can remember is that I felt scared of her being close to me , I would never want to hurt someone I just needed some space .
`` I do not remember ever touching her face , it would be completely out of character for me to ever touch someone 's face . ''
( Image : central news )
She also denied assaulting PC Skelton and said : `` I did not mean to kick him or hurt him . I was n't trying to hurt physically , I just needed to get him away from me .
`` I was n't in a fit state , I think he could clearly see that because I had been drinking and I had been in a nightclub and I was having a panic attack . ''
Brogan-Higgins , of Wandsworth , lost false nails from her hand and was left with blood on her hands after the altercation .
She was convicted of assault by beating and assaulting a police constable in execution of his duty last month .
Earlier the judge said she took the time to review the CCTV footage and was `` satisfied '' Brogan-Higgins was acting aggressively and became enraged at being refused entry .
`` There is no evidence to suggest that Ms Liutkute was pushing or shoving the defendant .
`` I am persuaded that Ms Liutkute was attacked and I find the defendant was not remorseful in the slightest .
`` I do not accept that the defendant was acting in self-defence - I am satisfied that the glass did strike Ms Liutkute and caused the injury prescribed . ''

Brogan-Higgins did not accept that she was intoxicated and described , on a scale of one to 10 that she was a `` six or a seven drunk '' .
But the judge added that she was confident that Brogan-Higgins `` continued to struggle '' when she was lawfully arrested by PC Skelton .
Brogan-Higgins appeared in the dock at Westminster Magistrates ' Court wearing a smart black skirt suit , grey roll-neck , black overcoat and a gold banded belt .
Judge Baines sentenced her to 20 weeks jail , concurrent on each count , but suspended the terms for a year .
Brogan-Higgins must pay £250 compensation to Ms Liutkute , £50 to PC Skelton and costs of £920 .
She was also ordered to serve 100 hours unpaid work , a 15 day rehab activity requirement and banned from the Box Nightclub for six months .
The case comes just two months after another posh beauty was spared a custodial sentence by a judge who ruled she was `` too clever for jail '' .
Lavinia Woodward - an Oxford medical student who hoped to become a surgeon - admitted stabbing her Tinder lover Thomas Fairclough but escaped with a suspended sentence .
It has emerged Woodward is now appealing her sentence .
“ Jurassic World Alive , ” out Wednesday on the App Store and Google Play Store , is a dinosaur-flavored take on games like “ Pokémon Go , ” letting players use their smartphones to track , capture and later fight a variety of dinosaurs from the upcoming movie “ Jurassic World : Fallen Kingdom . ”
The game is a sequel to 2015 's “ Jurassic World : The Game . ”
In “ Jurassic World Alive , ” players will encounter and collect a variety of dinosaurs while exploring their neighborhoods and cities . The game 's overview screen looks a lot like “ Pokémon Go 's , ” with a top-down map of real surroundings peppered with images of dinosaurs and supply drop boxes that can be spun to collect items . When a player taps on a dinosaur , the game launches a virtual drone , Players use the touchscreen of their device to aim and fire a tranquilizer dart at the dinosaur . The better the shot and the more a creature is hit with darts , the more DNA a player collects . That DNA is then used to eventually unlock and later genetically modify dinosaurs in a lab .
Once a player collects enough dinosaurs , they 're granted access to a mode that pits the creatures against one another in a real-time player-versus-player arena battle . A player can also view their collection of dinos in their real-world surroundings using the game 's augmented reality tech . In this mode , a player can take pictures or video of their dinos roaming around in a living room , out in the front yard , or wherever they 'd like .

The game offers a slightly more skill-based take on the popular “ Pokémon Go ” augmented reality title and is sure to be a big hit with fans of dinosaurs .
“ With Jurassic World Alive , our goal is for audiences to be fully immersed in a world with living dinosaurs in a way that 's never been possible until today , ” Alex Thabet , president and CEO of developer Ludia , said in a statement . “ Players will have the opportunity to connect with fellow ‘ Jurassic World ' fans who can search for dinosaurs together , as well as challenge each other in a unique real-time PvP battle mode accessible anywhere , anytime . ”
To celebrate the game launch , Walmart and AMC Theatres will offer players more ways to unlock valuable in-game content , according to the developer . From June 6 to July 31 , players who visit participating Walmart retail stores in the U.S. and Canada and open the game on their devices can locate an enhanced Walmart-branded supply drop with in-game rewards . Players can also head to any AMC location to track down rare AMC-branded incubators , which are capsules that contain valuable resources , such as dinosaur DNA .
“ Jurassic World Alive ” is now available to download for free , with in-app purchases , on the App Store and Google Play Store . “ Jurassic World : Fallen Kingdom ” arrives in theaters on June 22 .
( Reuters ) - South Carolina 's Charleston International Airport was evacuated for about two hours before dawn on Friday after screeners found a suspicious package that turned out to be an iPad , the airport 's top official said .
The iPad was spotted shortly after 5 a.m. EST ( 1000 GMT ) by U.S. Transportation Security Administration screeners as it went through an x-ray unit , airport Executive Director Paul Campbell said . He previously said the package was a laptop .
After TSA screeners determined that the iPad “ did n't look exactly right , ” the building was evacuated and the bomb squad called in , Campbell said . He did not explain why the iPad appeared suspicious to TSA personnel .
“ We erred on the side of caution , ” Campbell said at an airport news conference , a video of which was posted on the airport 's Twitter page .
The bomb squad determined that the iPad posed no threat , and its owner , after being questioned by law enforcement authorities , was released and rebooked on a flight , Campbell said .
The airport reopened shortly after 7 a.m. , with passengers lining up at security checkpoints , ticket counters and gates .
“ We apologise for the delay , but we 're not going to sacrifice safety for any reason , any reason at all , ” Campbell said .
Researchers Develop AI To Identify Depression In Instagram Photos
Trending News : Your Instagram May Be Able To Reveal If You 're Depressed
Long Story Short
When you 're blue , so are your Instagram photos . Researchers have developed a new AI driven technique that can tell .
Long Story
Depression is one of the most pernicious diseases the modern age . Or at least , we 're getting much better at detecting it . One 2012 study estimated that one in 20 Americans were currently suffering from depressive symptoms .
Young people ( and that includes young men ) are getting better at identifying the signs of depression , and also better at talking about it . But now science is helping out . Earlier this year , a new suite of mini-apps called IntelliCare was developed by Northwestern University that proved helpful in alleviating the symptoms of depression and anxiety .
Now , researchers from the University of Vermont and Harvard University have developed a technique of machine learning that can detect depressed people with 70 % accuracy . How ? By looking at their Instagrams .
If on the face of it this sounds like sorcery , the basic premise at least will go some way to convincing you . Essentially , when you 're feeling blue , your photos turn bluer too . They 're also inclined to be darker and use more greys , and not feature people nearly as often . Just like people signalling their sadness through body language and behaviour , depression can reveal itself through what you choose to post to social media .
The results of the computer learning test were published on August 8 in the data-science journal , EPJ Data Science . `` This points toward a new method for early screening of depression and other emerging mental illnesses , '' Chris Danforth said in a news release . Danforth is a professor at the University of Vermont and co-led the new study along with Andrew Reece of Harvard University .
The research called upon 166 volunteers to share close to 44,000 Instagram photos along with their mental health history . Then they analysed the photos using insights from established psychology research to look at people 's preferences for brightness , colour and shading . Pixel analysis showed depressed individuals posting photos that were bluer , darker and greyer than non-depressed individuals . They also tended to choose filters like Inkwell , making their photos black-and-white ( as opposed to healthy individuals , who tended towards filters like the eye-popping Valencia ) . Researchers also found that the depressed individuals were more likely to post photos without faces .
Interestingly , though , these pixel analysis techniques were far more effective than another set of volunteers attempting to distinguish between Instagram posts made by depressed people versus healthy . Their ratings also had no correlation with the features detected by the computer results . As researchers point out , you know your buddy better than a computer ; but when it comes to dealing with strangers , that 's when the difference could be felt — particularly when the computer model could detect signs of depression pre-diagnosis . `` This could help you get to a doctor sooner , '' Danforth says . `` Or , imagine that you can go to doctor and push a button to let an algorithm read your social media history as part of the exam .
`` This study is not yet a diagnostic test , not by a long shot , '' he continues , `` but it is a proof of concept of a new way to help people . ''

Ask The Big Question
What other areas of mental health could machine learning potentially help ?
Drop This Fact
Among Americans 12 years of age and over , a greater percentage of females report depression than males . Almost 10 % of US adults aged 40-59 reported current depression .
Federal health officials writing in a medical journal on Monday urged doctors to be on the lookout for Zika-related seizures and epilepsy among infants born to mothers infected with the virus while pregnant .
Citing recent studies that found seizures and epilepsy reported in some infants exposed to Zika while in the womb , Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned that cases of epilepsy caused by the virus may be misdiagnosed or underreported .
Health officials have known that Zika increases a pregnant woman 's chances of having a fetus or baby with a brain abnormality , such as microcephaly , and other neurological disorders associated with the virus , which attacks neural tissue .
Zika 's effects on a developing brain are similar to those of other central nervous system infections associated with epilepsy , according to the CDC , whose article cited two research reports conducted in Brazil in 2016 that suggest a link .
By increasing awareness and surveillance of seizures and epilepsy where active Zika transmission is occurring , the article states , health officials may better identify associated cases and improve their understanding of the virus 's impacts .
Zika is primarily transmitted by the bite of infected Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes , though the CDC has also reported cases of the virus spreading through blood transfusions , from pregnant mothers to their newborn children , and through sexual contact .
There is no treatment or cure for Zika , whose symptoms include fever , joint pain , red eyes and a rash , though only about one in five people with the virus experience symptoms . However , scientists have been working to develop a vaccine and have launched clinical trials in some areas with confirmed spread of the virus , including Miami .
In 2016 , Florida health officials confirmed 1,440 Zika infections , including 292 pregnant women .
But Zika has been nearly dormant in Miami-Dade this year , with two locally acquired cases confirmed and no zones of active transmission identified . In total , state health officials have reported 37 Zika infections statewide , including 20 pregnant women , for 2017 .
In addition , state officials have vowed a more robust response to Zika .
Florida Gov . Rick Scott 's budget proposal calls for new funding for the health department to hire more scientists and conduct more research to combat the spread of Zika , and Surgeon General Celeste Philip said in March that the state 's bureau of public labs has “ increased capacity greatly ” for testing .

NEW YORK ( AP )  The telecom industrys lobbying muscle pushed a consumer privacy measure to a swift death in Congress .
Republicans struck down Obama-era rules that would have imposed tight restrictions on what broadband companies such as Verizon , AT & T and Comcast could do with their customers personal data . Digital-rights and consumer-advocacy groups such as the Electronic Frontier Foundation supported keeping the rules . But they were outmatched by telecom trade groups and lobbyists .
These guys spend a fortune in D.C. , theyre very plugged in on the Hill and this was clearly their priority ,  said Craig Aaron , the president of consumer-advocacy group Free Press .
Former AT & T lobbyist Steve Billet , now on the faculty at George Washington University , said the telecom industrys willingness to spend big on lobbying marks the difference between them and the Electronic Frontier Foundation guys.

ROLLING IN THE CASH
The overall lobbying tab for telecom services and telephone companies exceeded $ 123 million in 2016 , the money-influence research group Center for Responsive Politics says . That makes them among the top-spending industries in Washington . By contrast , some of the most active privacy and consumer groups on the other side spent just over $ 1 million , according to the nonpartisan groups data .
The lobbying on both sides goes far beyond privacy . Other issues on the agenda included immigration , taxes , cable boxes and cybersecurity . But the disparity in the spending totals shows that when it comes to politics , industry can wield a lot of power with its pocketbook .
Telecom has also given more in political contributions to the House Republicans who voted to repeal the rules ( about $ 138,000 on average over their careers ) than to the 15 Republicans who voted to keep them ( $ 77,000 ) , according to the Center for Responsive Politics . In the Senate , the Republicans who voted to undo broadband privacy received more from telecom ( $ 369,000 ) than the Democrats who voted to keep the rules ( $ 329,000 ) .
Rep. Marsha Blackburn , R-Tenn. , who heads the House subcommittee on communications and technology , received more than $ 125,000 from telecom for the 2016 elections , while the ranking Democrat , Mike Doyle of Pennsylvania , got about $ 88,000 .
In the Senate , Jeff Flake , R.-Ariz. , chairman of a privacy and technology subcommittee , received some $ 59,000 , compared with nearly $ 27,000 for the ranking Democrat , Al Franken of Minnesota .
To be sure , money does not guarantee a favorable vote . Rep. Steny Hoyer of Maryland , the second-highest ranking Democrat in the House , received more than $ 1.3 million from telecom over his career and nearly $ 190,000 for the 2016 election . Yet he joined every other voting Democrat in opposing the industrys repeal efforts .
GETTING HEARD
The repealed rules would have required companies to get customers permission before offering marketers a wealth of information about them , including health and financial details , geographic location and lists of websites visited and apps used .
Republicans and industry officials complained that the restrictions would have unfairly burdened internet providers , as advertising rivals such as Google and Facebook dont have to abide by them .
The rules had been scheduled to take effect later this year . Congress used an obscure 20-year-old law to scrap this and numerous other regulations that Republicans consider costly , burdensome or excessive . President Donald Trump signed the privacy repeal into law early this month .
Although this repeal came as part of a broader deregulatory rush , the money that large corporations and their employees are able to spend on lobbyists and give to lawmakers helps get such issues on the agenda .
Individuals concerned about privacy would probably chat with an intern or low-level aide ; corporate executives giving a lot of money would have lawmakers ears at fundraising events , if not on Capitol Hill . The same goes for lobbyists for those companies .
Its the classic story where the side with more money has more influence here ,  said Dallas Harris , a policy fellow at Public Knowledge , which organized a campaign against the privacy repeal .
Comcast and Verizon did not respond to emailed questions . AT & T , when asked about lobbyings role in the repeal , pointed to a blog post saying its privacy protections have not changed . The cable trade group NCTA said it doesnt comment on specifics of lobbying .
A BIGGER FIGHT
Internet service providers and the rest of the telecom industry also had help . Groups representing the online advertising and broader consumer technology industries also wanted the rules gone . Google itself criticized them before the Federal Communications Commission approved them last year . This wasnt the net neutrality fight of 2014 , when telecoms squared off against tech companies .
I dont know that the ISPs themselves could have gotten the attention this issue got ,  said Bennett Ross , a telecom lawyer at Wiley Rein , which has a large telecom industry practice thats home to many former government staffers . I think it absolutely helped to have a number of different constituencies coming to Congress and saying this is a problem.
Plus , Free Press Aaron said , There were no citizens raising their voice saying this was a great idea . The lines were dropped pretty clearly here and Congress went with the companies . This was one of those instances that there wasnt an industry counterweight.
Expect fiercer lobbying  and more spending  as Republicans target a repeal of net neutrality rules , which prohibit ISPs from favoring their services over rivals . That battle is being waged at the FCCs offices as well as Congress .

KARACHI - Thar coal mining and 660 MW power project in Thar block II will be completed ahead of the schedule .
The commissioning date is set at June 3 , 2019 . This was unveiled by Sindh Engro Coal Mining Company ( SECMC ) Chief , Shamsuddin Ahmed Shaikh while speaking at an Iftar dinner programme at Mithi town of Tharparkar , says Engro statement here on Wednesday .
“ Despite declaring Gorano reservoir project technically and environmentally sound by the judicial committee of Sindh High Court , we are ready to talk to the protesters to remove their concerns which were created by misinformation , ” Shaikh said .
Sharing the details of the coal mining project , SECMC Chief said the company had completed 40 percent of the mining and 33 percent progress on the power projects in 15 months after the financial closure achieved in April 2016 .
The total duration envisaged for completion of the project was set at 42 months , but the pace of the work ensured of its completion in 38 months instead , he added .
Shamsuddin Shaikh said that he strongly believed , the benefits from the coal projects in Thar should go to the local people of Thar before the rest of the country . That 's why , he added , the company had started interventions in education , health , livelihood , and drinking water sectors for the people of the area and the schemes had already started benefiting the locales . Member of Sindh Assembly from district Tharparkar , Dr Mahesh Malani said that Thar coal block II project was one of the largest energy schemes of the country .
By many measures this should be the best of times for Andrea Horwath and the Ontario NDP she leads.She 's ranked as the most popular and the most trustworthy of the three major party leaders in Ontario , faring better in public opinion polls than either Liberal Premier Kathleen Wynne or Conservative leader Patrick Brown.She 's also an experienced campaigner , having led the NDP in the last two elections , and has survived the storms that face any leader during an intense election battle . In addition , she has a relatively strong team of veteran MPPs who can deliver votes in their respective ridings . Add in the fact Wynne is highly unpopular right now and Brown is still widely unknown and it 's easy to see why you 'd expect Horwarth and the NDP to be riding high just one year away from the June 7 , 2018 , provincial election.But instead , these may be the worst of times for Horwath and the NDP.Article Continued BelowWhile the mantra of “ time for change ” is strong after 14 years of Liberal rule , voters unhappy with Wynne are shifting to the Conservatives — not the NDP . Indeed , the party is mired in third place in the polls behind the Conservatives and Liberals and has been almost since the last election in 2014 . Its popular support is stuck in the 22-to 24-per-cent range , virtually unchanged from the 23.7 per cent it received in the 2014 election , while the Tories have surged at the expense of the Liberals.At the same time , barely 44 per cent of voters can identify Horwath as the party leader even though she 's held that job for eight years .

RIYADH ( Reuters ) - Saudi Arabia aims to generate 35 billion to 40 billion riyals ( $ 9 billion to $ 11 billion ) in non-oil revenues from its privatisation programme by 2020 and create up to 12,000 jobs , according to a document published by the official Saudi Press Agency on Tuesday .
The initiative targets 14 public-private partnership investments worth 24 billion to 28 billion riyals . It includes the corporatisation of Saudi ports and the privatisation of the production sector at the Saudi Saline Water Conversion Corp ( SWCC ) and the Ras Al Khair desalination and power plant , the document showed .
The government has said it plans to raise about $ 200 billion through privatisation in coming years as part of “ Vision 2030 ” reforms that aim to transform the economy of the world 's top oil exporter . It separately wants to raise another $ 100 billion through the sale of a five percent stake in Saudi Aramco ( IPO-ARMO.SE ) .
The new implementation document released on Tuesday charts the way forward for the period ending in 2020 , during which the government plans to privatise the national football league , flour mills at the General Silos and Flour Mills Organisation and part of SWCC .
It will also work on corporatising ports , privatising some services in the transportation sector , and transforming King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Centre into a non-profit organisation .
Most of these processes will be limited to corporatisation and preparatory procedures , with full privatisation not expected before 2020 , according to the document .
The government also plans to introduce a new indicator to evaluate the privatisation process in each target sector based on the number of bids submitted by the private sector and their value compared with the original financial value .
The full programme has over 100 potential initiatives in more than 10 sectors

In what was widely considered a down lead guard draft coming into the NCAA season , Alabama 's Collin Sexton and Oklahoma 's Trae Young have quickly emerged as the clear-cut leaders of the 2018 point guard pack .
Young 's Stephen Curry-esque deep pull-ups and Sexton 's explosive downhill dashes to the rim have taken college basketball by storm through the first quarter of the season , infusing a level of enthusiasm among NBA scouts regarding this big-heavy draft class . Although this year 's group still does n't feature the point guard depth of last year 's historically loaded crop , Sexton and Young are budding stars at the collegiate level with exciting , yet drastically different , skill sets and styles of play .
Peter Cvjetanovic did n't anticipate that a photo of him marching at a white nationalist rally in Charlottesville , Virginia would go viral . But that 's exactly what happened .
Since he was caught on camera , the University of Nevada , Reno senior has been facing condemnation and calls for his expulsion and firing from his campus job . But the university said today they are resisting those calls .
Following the “ Unite the Right ” rally in Virginia , Cvjetanovic spoke to multiple media outlets about the photo , which depicts him chanting and holding a lit torch as he marched across the University of Virginia campus on Friday with a group of white nationalists .
This angry young man is Peter Cvjetanovic , a student at @ unevadareno pic.twitter.com/7rLGJkcT3o — Yes , You 're Racist ( @ YesYoureRacist ) August 12 , 2017
The events were organized in response to the city 's planned removal of a statue of Confederate general Robert E. Lee and dissolved into violence both Friday night and Saturday .
“ I understand the photo has a very negative connotation . But I hope that the people sharing the photo are willing to listen that I 'm not the angry racist they see in that photo , ” Cvjetanovic , who is studying history and political science , told Channel 2 News in Nevada .
According to the Reno Gazette-Journal his given name is Cytanovic , but he uses the name Cvjetanovic . That 's the spelling that has appeared in most news stories about him .
Cvjetanovic went to the march because he supports the message that “ white European culture has a right to be here just like every other culture ” and wanted to “ honor and respect ” what Lee “ stood for during his time , ” he told Channel 2 .
“ As a white nationalist , I care for all people . We all deserve a future for our children and for our culture . White nationalists are n't all hateful ; we just want to preserve what we have , ” Cvjetanovic said .
After Twitter users , including Cvjetanovic 's classmates , identified him as a UNR student , university president Marc Johnson issued a statement Sunday acknowledging that one of the Charlottesville marchers did , indeed , attend UNR . The statement did not name Cvjetanovic directly .

“ Racism and white supremacist movements have a corrosive effect on our society , ” Johnson said . “ These movements do not represent our values as a university … As an institution , we remain firm in our commitment in denouncing all forms of bigotry and racism , which have no place in a free and equal society . ”
Johnson added that violence “ has no place on our campus ” and that greater understanding of others will come through “ open , honest , non-violent discussion and exploration of all ideas . ”
And @ PresMarcJohnson put out this statement in response… `` Racism and white supremacist movements have a corrosive effect on our society .. pic.twitter.com/7bMjz0fMGP — Benjamin Margiott ( @ BenMargiott ) August 13 , 2017
This afternoon , Johnson held a press conference responding directly to the calls for Cvjetanovic to be disciplined , expelled or fired from his on-campus job .
“ We 've had many suggestions of what the university should do with Peter Cvjetanovic , ” Johnson said . “ Most of those say that we should expel him , and terminate his employment at the university . However , in review [ with ] law enforcement and our legal team … we have no legal or constitutional basis upon which to expel him from studies or terminate him from employment , and we will not . ”
A Change.org petition demanding that Cvjetanovic be expelled and fired from his university job has earned over 16,000 signatures and counting in just over 24 hours . The petition 's author did not immediately respond to a request for comment .
And students have said they are reporting Cvjetanovic to the university 's student conduct office .
Alumni are also calling for Cvjetanovic to be expelled , including Johanna Jacobson , an alumna who penned an open letter to Johnson in the Reno Gazette-Journal . She wrote that Cvjetanovic remaining a student “ devalues ” her degree .
“ I am not a disinterested member of the public stirred up by sensationalism , calling for blood , ” Jacobson wrote . “ I am an alumna and a concerned citizen , calling for the expulsion of a student who has brought shame upon our university , who casts doubt upon the effectiveness of the history and political science departments , and who brings unnecessary liability to the UNR campus . ”
Cvjetanovic , perhaps anticipating the position the university would take , had told Channel 2 that he does not think administrators have the right to expel him from a public university .
“ I went to a legal political rally to express my freedom of speech , ” Cvjetanovic told Channel 2 . “ I committed no acts of violence , and dispersed when told that the rally had become illegal . Therefore I did nothing illegal at that rally . I am allowed to express my political beliefs , and if UNR does expel me , then it is a clear violation of my First Amendment ( rights ) . ”
But Cvjetanovic also told KRNV News 4 that he was not confident he would hold his campus job much longer , which , he said , requires a “ lot of human interaction . ”
In addition , Cvjetanovic told the Reno Gazette-Journal that he has received death threats that have been “ violent and graphic. ” He plans to report at least five of them to the Reno Police Department . Savidge did not respond to a question about how the university would handle conflicts between Cvjetanovic and other students , who are due to return to campus on August 28 .
Classmates and student groups have spoken out about their experiences with and ties to Cvjetanovic .
Bethanie Cooper , the president of UNR 's College Republicans , issued a statement after a photo of Cvjetanovic at a College Republicans event with Sen. Dean Heller ( R-NV ) circulated on social media .

Heller later responded to the photo by stating he did not know Cvjetanovic .
I do n't know this person & condemn the outrageous racism , hatred and violence . It 's unacceptable & shameful . No room for it in this country . https : //t.co/6yQqKZRowb — Dean Heller ( @ SenDeanHeller ) August 13 , 2017
Cooper said her group is “ working diligently ” with the university community to address allegations that a member — presumably Cvjetanovic — was involved in the rally at UVA . Cooper did not immediately reply to a request for comment on whether Cvjetanovic will be banned from her organization .
“ These dangerous beliefs will never have a place in the College Republicans or at the University of Nevada , ” Cooper wrote . She added that the group 's leadership “ has not and never would be involved in such violent and hate fueled demonstrations . ”

Cvjtanovic 's freshman year roommate , Ed Donofrio , told KRNV News 4 that Cvjtanovic “ once told a person of color that they deserve to be discriminated against. ” Donofrio expects Cvjtanovic to have a rocky start to his senior year due to his participation in the rally .
“ He 's not going to have a fun time when he comes back to campus , though , I can promise you that , ” Donofrio said . “ A lot of people are very angry at him . ”

BUENOS AIRES ( Reuters ) - The world 's financial leaders were seeking on Monday to clearly endorse free trade and renounce protectionism amid concern that U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum and looming actions against China could trigger a trade war that would hurt global growth .
Finance ministers and central bank governors of the world 's 20 biggest economies are meeting in Buenos Aires to discuss the economic outlook , capital flows , cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin , and how to prevent tax avoidance by international companies .
But since the unilateral decision by U.S. President Donald Trump on March 8 to impose tariffs of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminum , trade has become the focal point of the meeting .
“ I am seriously concerned that the foundation of our prosperity - free trade - is being put at risk , ” German Finance Minister Olaf Scholz told German mass-selling daily Bild .
“ Protectionism is not the answer to the difficulties of our time . The situation is serious , ” he said , adding he would be cautious yet about using the term trade “ war . ”
On Sunday Scholz said he would seek to dissuade Washington from imposing the planned punitive steel and aluminum tariffs which only come into effect on March 23 .
Others at the G20 meeting , which will conclude on Tuesday with a joint communique , shared Germany 's concern .
“ There is a solid understanding among the global community that free trade is important , ” Japanese central bank governor Haruhiko Kuroda told reporters upon arrival for the talks . Brazilian Central Bank governor Ilan Goldfajn also called on the G20 to work to keep global trade flows open .

The U.S. import tariffs on steel and aluminum have raised alarms among trading partners that Trump is following through on his threats to dismantle the decades-old trading system based around World Trade Organization rules in favor of unilateral U.S. actions .
Potentially broader anti-China tariffs and investment restrictions under consideration as part of a U.S. intellectual property probe have raised concerns that retaliation could seriously diminish global trade and choke off the strongest global growth since the G20 was formed during the 2008 financial crisis .
Morgan Stanley economists said in a report to clients late on Sunday that a broad-based application of U.S. “ Section 301 ” remedies resulting in a 20 percent tariff on Chinese manufactured goods , coupled with a commensurate response from China , would slash annual growth rates in both countries by a full percentage point within a year .

An early draft of the G20 communique seen by Reuters contained the phrase “ international trade and investment are important engines of growth . ”
It also said that G20 finance ministers stood by an agreement reached by their leaders in July last year in Hamburg .
A G20 official said discussions now centered on whether that language on trade would remain in the communique , which has to be endorsed unanimously , including by the United States .
The agreement from Hamburg , to which the Buenos Aires draft referred , said : “ We note the importance of bilateral , regional and plurilateral agreements being open , transparent , inclusive and WTO-consistent , and commit to working to ensure they complement the multilateral trade agreements . ”
Unilateral decisions by the United States to impose tariffs are seen as going against negotiated , or “ multilateral ” measures that would be part of the WTO .
The draft G20 communique also said that while the global economic outlook has been improving , “ a retreat to inward looking policies ” - suggesting protectionist trade practices - was a risk to growth .
President-elect Donald Trump takes the stage with vice president-elect Mike Pence during a rally in Orlando , Fla. , on Dec. 16 . `` Trying to measure Donald Trump 's likely moves from his past actions is a formidable challenge , '' writes Michael Coren , adding : `` Pray , though , that the vice-president never comes to power because unlike Trump , Mike Pence is a true believer , and those beliefs will unleash even more of the genuinely frightening forces in American society .

Britain 's former security minister , an old and good friend , once said to me , “ Predicting the future is not only useless but dangerous ; understanding the present and using that understanding to prepare for the future , however , is useful and vital. ” So how do we prepare for 2017 ? The details may be obscure but the trends are obvious . The Middle East will continue to be a fulcrum of foreign policy and international diplomacy but not within the traditional and somewhat stale , even banal , assumptions of the past . To see the situation through the prism of Israel and Palestine or Moscow and Washington simply wo n't do anymore and is the stuff of student politics . The sides are different now , the ambitions changed . A new Sunni world alliance is being formed , with the regional superpowers of Egypt , Saudi Arabia and Turkey binding together to combat Iran , Shia extremism , and also the threat of Sunni but unhinged and nihilistic Daesh , also known as ISIS . The latter may be horrific and cruel but while it can kill people it ca n't destabilize major Muslim governments , and there will be no caliphate . Iran and its junior siblings remain the main threat to the politicians in Ankara , Riyadh , Amman and the Gulf states , and it 's Persia , not Palestine , that is spoken about incessantly . To perfect a regional alliance these Arab states need Israel , and their traditional , if often cosmetic , hostility to the Jewish state is now little more than a façade . Hence the reality that Israel is closer to Egypt than at any time since the rule of President Sadat ; that Saudi diplomats are making conciliatory noises about peace in numerous international conferences ; and that Turkey has restored full diplomatic relations with Jerusalem and was one of the first countries to send aid when arson attacks ravaged Israel . Russia is the great winner in Middle Eastern foreign policy , being seen as a defender of Arab Christians , a bulwark against Daesh and an honest broker between Israel and the Arab states . That 's an immensely flattering view of Moscow , of course , but the fact is that Israel now has a conduit to Syria — and even Iran — through Russia and for the first time since the late '40s and early '50s the Israeli leadership is relatively close to the Kremlin .

What this means in the coming year to the West is unclear and , as a consequence , fascinating . Barack Obama 's regional policy was flawed largely because it was inconsistent . Confuse enemies but always reassure friends . Donald Trump may not have a grasp of the issues , but in the new secretary of state he does have a relatively clean sheet and that 's no bad thing . Rex Tillerson is a deeply worrying figure but his close relationship with Russia and knowledge of oil economics could be productive , whether we like it or not . When it comes to climate change , however , the Trump administration may well oversee a disastrous year , at a juncture when time is of the essence and we simply ca n't procrastinate and postpone any longer . If the political right is worried about immigration and refugees now , wait until weather conditions become even more disturbed and watch as the greatest migration in human history takes place . Reactionary platitudes , walls and violence will be like flatulence in the wind . I have no idea what Justin Trudeau will do and I 'm not sure it matters that much . Let me qualify the statement . This is , thank God , a country of privilege and stability . We need to expand care for the poor and marginalized , deal properly with the shameful way we 've treated indigenous people , introduce a carbon tax and keep our distance from Washington , but I will not pretend that I care passionately about electoral reform , the tiresome cliché of “ Justin 's honeymoon ” or who becomes the next Conservative leader . Trudeau has done very little , but even very little is preferable to what preceded him . Canada works , and our most pressing problems are challenging but relatively mild compared to almost every other country in the world .
As for the Tories , the contest winner can hold the trophy high but if they look closer it 's a poisoned chalice . If Kellie Leitch does manage to win she will throw her party into the wilderness of the clumsy , the malign and the shallow . For all of her verbiage about “ elites ” and “ Canadian values , ” no informed commentator believes a word of it and they know that this is political vulturism . The more people suffer and are frightened , the more the exploitative screams and shouts from the Leitch camp have resonance , and that 's a shameful legacy , indeed . The NDP has been largely anonymous since the tragic death of Jack Layton but if Charlie Angus becomes the new leader there is hope of something fresh , new and exciting in the Canadian body politic . It 's unlikely the party can ever form a federal government but as the conscious of the people it 's imperative it grows and has more clout in Ottawa . In Europe , the French will elect a new president and it 's likely going to be a choice between soft fascism and rock-hard conservatism . Marine Le Pen of the National Front may not adhere to the crypto-Nazism of her father , who led the party before her , but she 's still the champion of the angry and the xenophobic . François Fillon is the leader of the mainstream conservatives in France but he 's to the right of the party and is as popular as he is outspoken . If Le Pen wins — unlikely but not impossible — France will leave the European Union ; if Fillon triumphs , a Gallic version of Brexit will be urged by many of his supporters . If France did leave , the EU would collapse . The Germans could n't continue without the British and French economies and Italy is far from secure in its membership . Trying to measure Donald Trump 's likely moves from his past actions is a formidable challenge .

Mark Shuken , an experienced hand in the operation of regional sports networks , has been named president of Pac-12 Networks , the various TV outlets operated on behalf of Western universities including UCLA , USC and Arizona State University . He is set to join the Pac-12 officially on September 6 .
“ I have a lot of experience in sports-content creation ” as well as in working with the needs of cable and satellite distributors , said Shuken , in an interview . He has created and marketed regional sports network for the Los Angeles Lakers , Los Angeles Dodgers and LA Galaxy , and worked for Time Warner Cable Sports Network and DirecTV Sports Networks , and served as president and CEO of Liberty Sports Group .
Shuken fills a post previously held by Lydia Murphy-Stephans , the former Olympic speed skater who became the first woman to head a national sports network . She stepped down from the job in June to launch her own media consultancy .
Pac-12 has agreements in place with both ESPN and Fox Sports to carry some of its games through 2024 , said Larry Scott , the Pac-12 Conference 's Commissioner , in an interview . That gives Shuken some time to focus not only on beefing up advertising and sponsorship revenue , but also to explore digital distribution . “ We are dipping our toe in the water , delivering content on twittera and with Facebook Live , ” said Scott . “ I think you will see us do more of that with some of the new companies that are going to make more of a priority around live video . ”
Launched in August of 2012 , Pac-12 Network is the first of its kind : a regional sports network devoted to a particular collegiate athletic conference that is owned outright by the universities that supply its content . Fox , CBS and ESPN had a hand in similar outlets , such as Big Ten Network or SEC Network . As such , said Scott , “ we are able to follow our own decisions on production and generating additional income and eyeballs . ”
Pac-12 Networks incorporates one national and six regional television networks , plus digital content that is made accessible through social media , university websites and Pac-12 Now , a streaming service for authenticated subscribers to cable or satellite service . Each year , Pac-12 Networks offers live coverage of 850 sporting events
Pac-12 also wants to work on developing audiences around some sports that may not always get national attention , such as swimming or soccer . Shuken said he sees an opportunity to engage alumni and work fan bases to create communities around various sports . “ You 'll see some data saying sports that one might find obscure – wrestling , for example – you have passionate audiences around . Every sport has its passionate audiences . ”
With the 2018 NHL Draft less than a month away , Montreal Canadiens ' fans are buzzing with the enthusiasm of a team with a top five pick . Choosing third practically guarantees a player who is NHL ready , and after a season where the team finished third to last in the NHL in goals scored , there is hope that their top selection will move right into the lineup and contribute both at even strength and on the powerplay .
Current rankings still suggest sniper Filip Zadina will be the likely candidate for their first round pick ; his knack for goal scoring and maturity in international competition will be felt as soon as he joins his new team . The Canadiens also have four second round picks . If their draft history is any indication , this round can be quite lucrative , as past selections featured stars such as P.K . Subban , Jose Theodore , Patrice Brisebois and Mike Ribeiro .
Part of the reason for the Habs ' wealth in this round stems from the often liberal way second round picks are almost given away by general managers of other teams . This year their selections are the result of trades with the Washington Capitals , Toronto Maple Leafs and Chicago Blackhawks and all involving centres – a position where the team has been weak for some time . With many gaps to fill in their roster , here are some of the team 's best options for June .
Focus on Defense
For general manager Marc Bergevin , a big challenge in the coming years is to continue to develop NHL ready defensemen . With the prospect of Victor Mete and Noah Juulsen becoming regulars next year , the Canadiens are beginning to address the offensive holes in the lineup left by the recent departures of P.K . Subban , Alexei Emelin , and Andrei Markov . However , their weak performance on the penalty kill last season is a good indicator they are still thin on the back end , especially from the left side .
Jonathan Tychonick is quick , mobile , and solid on the power play . He 's heading to the University of North Dakota but if he continues to develop he can become the highly coveted defender who can play the point and make that first pass out of his zone . Mattias Samuelsson is another tempting prospect . If the last name sounds familiar , he 's the son of former NHLer Kjell Samuelsson but is more mobile and offensive-minded than his father , and almost as big . There is something to be said for drafting a kid who knows the professional hockey world more intimately at the outset . There 's no doubt he 's been educated on the life of a successful athlete , which will speed up his maturation process .
Quebec Players at Centre
Jean Beliveau , Henri Richard and Jacques Lemaire were three iconic centres who were part of the Canadiens ' glory years when they won 16 of their 24 Stanley Cups . They were also Quebec-born players who were a great source of pride for local fans . The team has always placed an emphasis on trying to build around French-speaking players and when the Habs failed to select Quebecer Denis Savard in the 1980 draft , many saw this as the beginning of their decline from perennial champions to a team that has won only two cups since 1979 .
Savard 's return to the club in a controversial trade a decade later served only to illustrate the problems the team was facing in finding and developing talent , appearing as a shallow attempt to right a wrong from years earlier . Luckily , the current draft offers them an opportunity to find homegrown talent that could have an impact on the team in the short and long-term .
Benoit-Olivier Groulx
While the team is not likely to draft a local centre in the first round , some interesting prospects are available further down in the draft . An obvious choice for their 35th or 38th pick is Benoit-Olivier Groulx of the Halifax Mooseheads . Although born in France , “ Bo ” grew up in Gatineau , Quebec and is the son of the AHL Syracuse Crunch coach Benoit Groulx . Selected first in the 2016 QMJHL Draft , he has matured into a solid two-way centre or winger who plays a 200-foot game and is continuing to work on his skating .
If drafted he gives the Habs a potential centre to replace Tomas Plekanec and Lars Eller , and could possibly mature into a top six forward . If anything , he will fit well into a team that places a priority on defense over offense , and his performance in the playoffs indicates a player who can deliver in the clutch .
Gabriel Fortier
Gabriel Fortier could also be a great find in the second round . A speedy two way players with the Baie-Comeau Drakkar , Fortier has great skills around the net and with his tireless energy and enthusiasm , the Lachine-native 's on-ice play reminds me of Brendan Gallagher , who himself was n't even drafted until the fifth round . His success in international play has probably also increased his value and some are comparing him to a local centre who is likely to be picked in the first round this year , Joe Veleno . Again , he presents Habs fans with a local talent who could be NHL ready in a couple of years .
Finding Success All Through the NHL Draft
If the Edmonton Oilers recent struggles are a good indicator , a team can not expect to win based solely on obtaining a high first-round draft pick every year . Many successful teams in recent years were particularly adept at finding talent all through the draft and developing them in their farm system . This requires the cooperation of a coaching staff who understand the fragility of teenage egos , especially among players who are used to excelling at every level and who are away from home for the first time . A good coach has to be both parent and psychologist , and sometimes looking no further than a draft pick 's family is a good place to uncover a few clues for potential rapid development .
The Canadiens success with Brendan Gallagher is a prime example . Drafted in 2010 , there was little buzz around a forward that – at five-foot-nine – seemed to be another small player on a team desperate for size in a league where bruising power forwards were still the norm . His father Ian , a conditioning coach in the WHL , kept his son close to organized hockey , acting as his personal trainer and coach . When he was drafted by the Vancouver Giants , the young Gallagher was also able to rely on the strength of his family to stay on track , living at home while playing for the Giants .
While this kind of arrangement is optimal , many young players have to travel long distances and remain far from their family and friends while developing their talent . Still , if finding a few more homegrown stars and NHL legacy players helps to overcome this , the Canadiens could surprise us with their success in the upcoming draft a few years down the road .

But in his newest video where he professes his love for Beyoncé — in all good-natured fun , of course — things just got far more strange with Mr. Gnarles Barkley/ Davidson .
From hoaxing everyone with an exploding phone to stepping out at the Grammys in literally all gold , CeeLo Green has kept us all scratching our heads lately .
The video is fittingly titled “ Jay-Z 's Girl , ” and features an adolescent boy , assumingly a young CeeLo , in a bedroom fixed with dozens of Queen Bey posters , both old and new . In the beginning , he tucks away a poster of Jay-Z as we see his room scattered in Bey regalia , including her B'Day album , as well as a drawing of her and her husband , Jay-Z .
“ Sorry , Jay , ” he says as the track begins . “ But I love her , too — what am I supposed to do ? ”
Paying homage to King Jay as his “ biggest fan , ” the kid bounces around different scenery as he agonizingly proclaims how bad he wishes to be the lucky man in Bey 's life . Even the stars say so , as he makes his way to the balcony where the Houston songstress 's face appears in the array of stars .
“ He wears his hat down over his eyes , ” he sings in the chorus . “ And he 's smooching her with those lips , I just know it . And he 's driving around in his Maybach late at night . Do n't you know I want Jay-Z 's girl ? ”
We understand , CeeLo . At least you 're not alone .
Check out his undying love for Queen Bey in the `` Jay-Z 's Girl '' video below .

Sioux Falls police say a 5-year-old Iowa girl who drowned in a river in a Sioux Falls park had reached out to touch the foam near some waterfalls when she slipped into the water .
Police spokesman Sam Clemens said Monday Maggie Jo Zaiger , of Audubon , Iowa , fell into the Big Sioux River in Falls Park near a pedestrian bridge Sunday , a spot not far from where two others drowned in 2013 .
Sioux Falls parks and recreation director Don Kearney says after the 2013 deaths , the city upgraded its caution signs to warn adults to keep close watch on young children , among other things . Kearney says the foam is a naturally occurring phenomenon created by phosphorus and the agitated water .
He says the city considered installing barricades near the falls , but felt that would create a false sense of security .

Lung cancer remains Iowa 's top cancer killer , but there 's a new type of lung cancer screening for people considered high-risk .
The low-dose CT scan can detect lung cancer in the early stages , before symptoms arise . Harold Wimmer , national president and CEO of the American Lung Association , calls the scan groundbreaking and a potential lifesaver .
Wimmer says , “ The high-risk category profile is individuals who are current smokers or former smokers that have a 30-pack year history of smoking and are between the ages of 55 to 80. ” The term “ 30-pack year history ” means they 've smoked an average of one pack a day for 30 years , or two packs a day for 15 years .
Studies find 84-percent of lung cancer cases are detected in the late stage when it 's very difficult to treat . When detected earlier , the survival rate is increased by more than five times . Wimmer says anyone can get lung cancer , especially people who smoke and those around them .
“ There 's also other risk factors , such as radon exposure , family history , other environmental impacts that can be a risk factor , ” Wimmer says , “ but the use of tobacco products is still the number-one risk factor for lung cancer. ” In Iowa , 42-percent of the population is considered “ ever smokers , ” meaning they 're either current or former smokers , and they may benefit from the scan .
“ Individuals can go to SavedByTheScan.org to take a quiz to see if they may fit into that high-risk category , ” Wimmer says . “ We also encourage individuals to talk to their doctor about having this scan done . ”
The scan is typically a covered benefit under most insurance plans , according to Wimmer . There were more than 2,400 new lung cancer cases diagnosed in Iowa last year and nearly 1,800 deaths . Nationwide , lung cancer kills an average of 421 people daily , that 's about 18 deaths each hour , or one death every three-and-a-half minutes .

NAIROBI ( Reuters ) - Former U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan told political leaders in Kenya on Saturday to be `` careful with their rhetoric and actions '' and urged opposition leader Raila Odinga to pursue any complaints over the vote in court .
The warning from Annan , who mediated during a post-election crisis a decade ago , came as the death toll from violence since Tuesday 's vote rose to at least 24 .
Odinga 's coalition has rejected the results , claiming massive fraud , and said it will not go to court to challenge them .
ANKARA - Turkey 's opposition Monday called for the annulment of a referendum giving President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan sweeping new powers , as international monitors voiced concern over the campaign and vote count .
The referendum was seen as crucial not just for shaping the political system of Turkey but also the future strategic direction of a nation that has been a NATO member since 1952 and an EU hopeful for half a century . Showing no sign of pulling his punches after the referendum victory , Erdoğan sparked new alarm in EU capitals by saying Turkey 's next plebiscite could be on re-introducing the death penalty .
The 'Yes ' camp won 51.41 percent in Sunday 's referendum and 'No ' 48.59 , according to complete results released by election authorities .
Erdoğan , who opponents fear could now assume one-man rule , returned to Ankara from Istanbul , welcomed by thousands lining the roads as he drove in triumph aboard the presidential bus .
In a brief speech from the airport , Erdoğan congratulated cheering supporters for `` standing tall '' in the face of the `` crusader mentality '' of the West .
But the opposition immediately cried foul over alleged violations , claiming that a clean vote would have made a difference of several percentage points and handed them victory .
The main opposition Republican People 's Party ( CHP ) and the pro-Kurdish Peoples ' Democratic Party ( HDP ) said they would challenge the results from most of the ballot boxes due to alleged violations .
`` There is only one decision to ease the situation in the context of the law - the Supreme Election Board ( YSK ) should annul the election , '' the Dogan news agency quoted CHP deputy leader Bulent Tezcan as saying .
The opposition was particularly incensed by a decision by the YSK to allow voting papers without official stamps to be counted , which they said opened the way for fraud . The referendum has no `` democratic legitimacy '' , HDP spokesman and MP Osman Baydemir told reporters in Ankara .
The opposition had already complained of an unfair campaign that saw the 'Yes ' backers swamp the airwaves and use up billboards across the country in a saturation advertising campaign .
The referendum campaign was conducted on an `` unlevel playing field '' and the vote count itself was marred by the late procedural changes that removed key safeguards , international observers said .
`` The legal framework ... remained inadequate for the holding of a genuinely democratic referendum , '' the OSCE Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights ( ODIHR ) and the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe ( PACE ) monitors said in a joint statement . `` Late changes in counting procedures removed an important safeguard , '' said Cezar Florin Preda , the head of the PACE delegation , referring to a move by the election authorities to allow voting documents without an official stamp .
But Turkey 's foreign ministry his back at the assessment , saying it was `` biased '' and `` prejudiced '' and adding it was `` unacceptable '' to say the poll did not reach democratic standards .
Erdoğan 's victory was far tighter than expected , emerging only after several nail-biting hours late Sunday which saw the 'No ' result dramatically catch up in the later count . Turkey 's three largest cities - Istanbul , Ankara and Izmir - all voted 'No ' although 'Yes ' prevailed in Erdoğan 's Anatolian heartland .
`` The 'Yes ' was victorious but the people have sent messages to the government and opposition that need to be carefully considered , '' wrote pro-government Hurriyet columnist Abdulkadir Selvi .
The new system is due to come into effect after elections in November 2019 although Erdoğan is expected to rapidly rejoin the ruling Justice Development Party ( AKP ) he founded but had to leave when he became president .
In a bid to get back to business , Erdoğan was on Monday to chair a cabinet and security meeting at his presidential palace that could extend the nine-month state of emergency brought in after the July 15 failed coup .
The new system would dispense with the office of prime minister and centralise the entire executive bureaucracy under the president , giving Erdoğan the direct power to appoint ministers .
- Reviving the death penalty ? -
In an indication more strife with Brussels could be in the offing , Erdoğan said he would now hold talks on reinstating capital punishment , a move that would automatically end Turkey 's EU bid .
If the opposition failed to support such a bill , he said another referendum could be held on reinstating the death penalty .
German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel said that if Ankara were to bring back the death penalty , the move would be `` synonymous with the end of the European dream '' and mark the end of decades of talks to enter the European Union .
In an interview in the Bild mass circulation daily to be published Tuesday , he warned Turkey that `` joining would not work right now '' .
If Turkey were to hold a referendum on bringing back capital punishment it would be a break with European values , the French president 's office warned .

CHICAGO - Missouri Governor Eric Greitens - once a rising Republican political star – has resigned amid expanding investigations of a sex scandal and potential violations of campaign finance laws .
It was a stunning fall from grace for the military veteran and Rhodes scholar once rumored to be considering an eventual run for the presidency .
The Midwestern US state 's legislature , controlled by the governor 's own party , was in the midst of a special session to consider whether Greitens should be impeached , when the governor announced his resignation would be effective Friday evening .
`` This ordeal has been designed to cause an incredible amount of strain on my family , '' said the defiant governor , who had repeatedly called the investigations against him a `` witch hunt , '' borrowing a favorite phrase of President Donald Trump .
`` I have not broken any laws or committed any offense worthy of this treatment , '' he added at a brief news conference , at one point clearly holding back tears .
Greitens 's troubles had mushroomed over revelations of a 2015 extra-marital affair and charges , which he vehemently disputed , that he attempted to blackmail his mistress into silence with a compromising semi-nude photo .
The state legislature 's investigation had expanded to probe potential campaign finance violations , as questions swirled about whether the governor 's campaign illegally coordinated with a non-profit organization to conceal the identity of political donors .
The governor 's decision came after a judge compelled Greitens to release information about A New Missouri and any communications or coordination between the group and his own campaign fund , according to the St Louis Post-Dispatch newspaper .
A former Greitens campaign adviser also told a state House investigative committee that the campaign had considered soliciting donations from foreign nationals , according to the newspaper .
The former US Navy SEAL and nonprofit founder , who swept into power in the 2016 election , had alienated many in the Midwestern state 's political establishment by casting himself as an outsider and criticizing lawmakers of both parties who disagreed with him .
The 44-year-old married governor was hobbled when an extramarital affair from two years ago became public in January , including allegations that he attempted to coerce his mistress into silence .

Aug 11 , 2017 ; Charlotte , NC , USA ; Louis Oosthuizen tees off on the third hole during the second round of the 2017 PGA Championship at Quail Hollow Club . Mandatory Credit : Kyle Terada-USA TODAY Sports
CHARLOTTE , North Carolina ( Reuters ) - Louis Oosthuizen looked in trouble after swinging down onto a tree root with an approach shot at the second hole but the South African shook off the injury scare as a momentary jolt and said it did not impair him during the PGA Championship third round .
Oosthuizen , who shook his right arm in discomfort after hitting the shot with his back against a tree , walked down the fairway with a physio working on him .
The 2010 British Open champion parred the hole and went on to register a level-par 71 for a five-under 208 total that left him two shots behind leader Kevin Kisner going into Sunday 's final round .
`` It 's fine . It was n't hurting at all . I did n't feel like it was painful or anything . It was just it got tight really quickly , '' he told reporters .
`` I could feel it all over . I thought it would be good to get the physio and release it . He just did a proper release of it . There was no pain . I could hit my shots , no worries . ''
More worrisome for Oosthuizen was the condition of his eight-iron .
`` I was going pretty steep on it . Took a big chunk out of it . Bent my eight-iron properly , '' said Oosthuizen , who had to go with his seven-iron instead on two approach shots in the closing holes including the 16th , which he bogeyed .
Oosthuizen tried to bend the club back but to no avail .
`` I tried to fix it , but obviously I 'm not good at that , '' he said . `` I got it to the club and they tried to fix it , but it was just right in the hozzle where the shaft goes in . Ping is already building me a new one and getting it to me . ''

“ Star Wars ” producer Gary Kurtz and British crime film director Greg Hall are teaming on an untitled feature film about iconic British poet and playwright Christopher Marlowe .
Kurtz and Hall announced the project on Wednesday , the 425th anniversary of the death of Marlowe at the age of 29 . Marlowe is best remembered as William Shakespeare 's friend and rival , but the film will explore the aftermath of his role as a spy for the British crown while a student at Cambridge University .
Marlowe wrote “ The Jew of Malta , ” “ Edward the Second ” and “ Doctor Faustus. ” His death has long been assumed to have been as a result of a fight between friends over a bar bill . But , according to the filmmakers , he was assassinated as a matter of state policy because of his involvement in secret affairs .
The script , by Francis Hamit , details Marlowe 's career as a spy as part of the early English Secret Service , which fought a bitter war with Catholics , who wanted Elizabeth I assassinated and Mary , Queen of Scots , placed on the throne instead . Even after Mary was executed , the threat persisted and resulted in Elizabeth 's seeking to control every aspect of English life and culture through , in part , an extensive system of spies and censorship .
Marlowe 's own rebellion included preaching atheism and openly bragging about his own homosexuality at a time when other men were burned at the stake for it . As he was the most famous playwright of his day , he was too well-known and popular to be tried and executed publicly , so , according to the filmmakers , he was secretly assassinated by his fellow secret service agents .
“ Marlowe is a tragic figure , undone by his own fatal flaws , ” Hamit said . “ Despite the passage of time , it is a story which will resonate with today 's audiences . ”
Hall said , “ The storyline is quite dynamic . It 's more about the secret underworld of spies and criminals that Kit Marlowe embraced at the same time he was social climbing with very prominent men , such as Sir Walter Raleigh and Sir Francis Walsingham , the Secretary of State and most powerful man in England . It is going to be a very exciting production and we are casting it now . ”
Plans are to make the film mostly in Wales this fall . North American distribution has been assigned to Lightyear Entertainment in Los Angeles . Arnie Holland , Lightyear 's CEO , is an executive producer along with Michael John Donahue and Craig Miller , CEO of Wolfmill Entertainment .
Besides the original “ Star Wars , ” Kurtz ' producing credits include “ American Graffiti , ” “ The Empire Strikes Back , ” “ The Dark Crystal ” and “ Return to Oz. ” Hall 's breakthrough debut drama was “ The Plague ” in 2006 , followed by “ Kapital , ” “ Communion ” and “ Bonded by Blood 2. ” Hamit is a graduate of the Iowa Writers Workshop , has published two historical spy novels set at the time of the American Civil War , and is working on a memoir about military intelligence during the Vietnam War .

ISLAMABAD : Finance Minister Ishaq Dar in Wednesday 's National Assembly ( NA ) session said that the state institutions were not creating any hurdle in the proceedings of the joint investigation team ( JIT ) formed to investigate Panamagate .
“ I am fasting and Allah knows no attempts were made to create any hindrance in proceedings of the JIT . The cooperation with the JIT was not denied at any stage , ” said Dar , strongly denying the claims made by the opposition .
The minister said that there was no reason to bar any of the department “ under my ministry from cooperating in investigations . ”
“ We have respect for courts . Opposition members should also avoid issuing verdicts only on the basis of news stories , ” he said , mentioning the PML-N always believed in supremacy of the constitution .
Earlier , opposition leader Khursheed Shah the report of the Joint Investigation Team ( JIT ) was very alarming from various aspects .
“ As tempering , forgery and change in evidence was mentioned in the report , ” he said , adding that nobody would trust constitution , law and judiciary if such things happen . PTI 's Shah Mehmood Qureshi claimed that government institutions were creating hindrance in the JIT proceedings .

Hunter Greene walks off the stage after being selected No . 2 by the Cincinnati Reds in the first round of the Major League Baseball draft on Monday . ( Julio Cortez / The Associated Press )
He has yet to sign a contract , yet to take his first steps as a professional and yet to experience the toll of the unique brand of intense fan and media scrutiny that is likely to meet his first extended slump , but already this much is clear about Hunter Greene : He may be the most intriguing , most important baseball prospect to arrive in years , if not ever . Greene , the 17-year-old Los Angeles prep superstar taken by the Cincinnati Reds with the second overall pick of this week 's amateur draft , possesses the sort of electrifying ability one might expect of someone so young taken so high in the draft . But Greene 's potential impact goes well beyond that . In many ways , he could be — as the headline of the Sports Illustrated cover story on him this spring put it , in all-caps — “ THE STAR BASEBALL NEEDS , ” and he is arguably the most marketable baseball prospect to come along since another former teenage SI cover boy , Bryce Harper , arrived in 2010 , selected by the Washington Nationals with the first overall pick . Like Harper , Greene has the requisite combination of generational talent , preternatural charisma and indefinable star power to become an iconic player of his era . Both have compelling family backstories : Harper 's father , Ron , was a Las Vegas steelworker who helped build some of the city 's iconic casinos ; Greene 's father , Russell , is a renowned private investigator whose clients include Justin Bieber , Kanye West and the Kardashians . But there are elements of Greene 's overall package that even Harper ca n't match .

Most significantly , Greene is African American , and comes along at a time when the sport 's effort to retain a foothold in the black community has reached a crossroads : Despite a massive expenditure in money and manpower on the part of Major League Baseball , fewer than eight per cent of big leaguers are African-American , down from a peak of around 20 per cent in the 1980s . ( Royce Lewis , the Orange County prep shortstop taken with the first overall pick by the Minnesota Twins , also has an African-American father . ) As a Little Leaguer , Greene attended MLB 's Urban Youth Academy in Compton , California — one of the initiatives the sport has introduced in recent years in an attempt to grow the game in African-American communities . When he was 13 , he won an essay-writing contest , the prize for which was an audience with Jackie Robinson 's daughter , Sharon . He clearly understands and embraces the responsibility that comes with having his stature and platform . “ This is huge for our game , ” commissioner Rob Manfred , who announced each pick from the MLB Network studios in Secaucus , New Jersey , told reporters . “ We hope these programs will continue to produce players like Hunter . ”
But Greene has a chance to be a baseball trailblazer in another way that has nothing to do with race . As a legitimate two-way prospect — a right-handed pitcher whose fastball has been clocked at 102 mph and a slugging shortstop with elite power — he is in position , under the right development plan , to blow away the baseball norms that hold that top prospects and impact big-leaguers are either pitchers or hitters , but never ( or at least not since the days of Babe Ruth ) both . ( In this endeavour , he could be beaten to the history books . Louisville left-hander/first baseman Brendan McKay , another two-way star , is closer to being big-league-ready ; he was taken fourth overall by Tampa Bay . Or perhaps by Shohei Otani , a legitimate two-way superstar known as “ the Babe Ruth of Japan , ” who is considering playing in America in the next two years . ) When he was asked by reporters Monday night , following his selection by the Reds , whether he considers himself first and foremost a pitcher or a shortstop , Greene replied , “ All of the above. ” “ On the mound , I consider myself a monster , ” Greene told reporters , describing his different approaches to pitching and hitting . “ I pound the zone . I get ahead . I stare guys in the eyes . I just like the whole competitive edge . At shortstop , showing my range and having smooth hands and footwork and firing across the diamond . Then hitting , just having good pitch selection and crushing balls , that 's me . . . . “ I still love doing both , and I think the ball club is excited for getting two players for one . So I think they 're pretty pumped for that. ” That may not be exactly true . While the Reds have said they will have an open mind to allowing Greene to continue pursuing his hitting career , they made it clear they drafted him as a pitcher . “ Playing at the highest level is very difficult , ” Reds general manager Dick Williams told reporters following the selection of Greene , “ and I would n't want someone to focus on both to the detriment of one . We think Hunter 's got a great chance to be a major-leaguer as a pitcher . We think the potential is there as a position player . I think at first we will focus on pitching , [ but also ] allow him to take at-bats . We 'll keep the door open to playing in the field . This is a very unique situation , something we 've never been confronted with before. ” Greene has n't pitched since April , so assuming he signs quickly — with a bonus expected to be in the high seven figures — and is able to begin his professional career in a developmental league this summer , he will be brought along slowly . And even if his development as a pitcher goes perfectly , it is likely to be years before we see Greene in the major leagues . Only five pitchers this century , most recently the Los Angeles Dodgers ' Jose Urias last season , have appeared in a big league game as a teenager . But if and when he arrives , on a pitcher 's mound or in a batter 's box — or perhaps in both — Greene is likely to have an immediate impact on the sport , one that will rise in direct proportion to how well he performs on the field . Already , before his pro career has even begun , it is safe to say baseball has never seen a prospect like him .

ISLAMABAD , Feb 15 ( APP ) : Minister of State for Information , Broadcasting and National Heritage Marriyum Aurangzeb Wednesday condemned the terrorist attack in Hayatabad , Peshawar .
In a statement issued in the aftermath of the attack , she said she was appalled to learn about this tragic incident that had claimed two lives and injured dozens of people .
The second attack within three days indicated that the terrorist outfits were under tremendous pressure due to the persistent and unflinching efforts of the country 's security forces and law enforcing agencies to eliminate the scourge of terrorism and were making last ditch efforts to break the resolve of the government and the people of Pakistan , she added .
The minister said the terrorists would not succeed in their nefarious designs to harm the country .
“ Such incidents further strengthen and reinforce the determination of the nation , government and the law enforcement agencies to up the ante against the terrorists , ” she said .
The government had an unfaltering commitment to defeat the cancerous
ideology of the terrorists and make them pay for their heinous crimes , she added .
Strongly condemning the attack , she expressed heart felt condolences with the bereaved families and prayed may Allah rest the souls of the martyrs in peace and grant courage to their families to bear their
losses , the minister said .
WASHINGTON , Feb 2 ( Reuters ) - U.S. President Donald Trump accused the FBI and the Justice Department of politicizing its investigations on Friday , just as the White House is expected to approve the release of a secret Republican memo alleging FBI bias against him in its Russia probe .
“ The top Leadership and Investigators of the FBI and the Justice Department have politicized the sacred investigative process in favor of Democrats and against Republicans - something which would have been unthinkable just a short time ago . Rank & File are great people ! , ” Trump wrote in a post on Twitter . ( Reporting by Susan Heavey ; Editing by Peter Graff )
Hundreds of students clashed with government forces in Indian-held Kashmir during protests Monday against a police raid on a college , as tensions ran high in the restive region .
At least 100 students were injured as Indian police used batons and tear gas to try to quell the protests , which broke out in the main city of Srinagar before spreading to other parts of the Kashmir valley .
Teenagers in school uniform and women students wearing white headscarves were among the protesters , who chanted anti-India slogans and threw stones at government forces .
A student union had called for protests after police on Saturday tried to raid a college in the southern district of Pulwama to round up suspects in recent violent demonstrations , sparking clashes in which at least 60 students were injured .
“ Students are protesting in a few colleges . We are dealing with a situation , ” a senior Indian police office told AFP on condition of anonymity .
Indian-held Kashmir has been tense since April 9 , when eight people were killed by police and paramilitary troops during election day violence .
Footage apparently showing a civilian tied to the front of an army jeep to deter protesters from throwing stones at the vehicle has also caused outrage after it was circulated on social media last week .
The army has launched an investigation into the incident and police have registered a case although no arrests have yet been made .
The Kashmir University Students Union , a banned student body , had called for protests in all colleges and universities following Saturday 's incident .
Government forces are not supposed to enter college or university premises without special permission , and on Saturday , the union said the police action was designed to help the state “ rule by repression and fear ” .
Kashmir has been divided between India and Pakistan since the end of British rule in 1947 . Both claim the territory in its entirety .
Armed encounters between separatists fighting Indian rule and government forces have become more frequent since the killing of a popular separatist leader by security forces last July sparked widespread unrest . Police and army officials say dozens of local youths have joined the rebel ranks since then .

Amid Citibank Korea 's recent decision to close down 80 percent of its physical branches nationwide , industry insiders are waiting to see how this bold push for non-face-to-face banking will stir the domestic banking industry.Citibank said slashing 101 branches is part of the company 's next generation of consumer finance strategy that emphasizes enhanced digital channels.In lieu of physical bank branches , the local unit of the US corporation will be introducing its new Client Engagement Center , which is said to utilize diverse nonphysical channels such as internet phone , mobile applications and ATMs . The dramatic shift toward information technology convergence means only 32 Citi branches will remain nationwide.According to a press statement by the company Thursday , more than 95 percent of all its customer financial transactions already happen via non-face-to-face transactions . The move is purportedly intended to help minimize the “ hassle of visiting a branch and waiting. ” “ In today 's world , the approach where we ask customers to come to a branch between 9 and 4 to get service no longer works , ” said Brendan Carney , Consumer Business Head at Citibank Korea , in the statement. “ We need to extend banking services to be more accessible to customers wherever they are , ” he continued . “ Through our Client Engagement Center ( Client Relationship Deepening Center ) that is being introduced , we 're aligning our professional financial talent towards digital channels -- mobile and internet -- not simply creating a call center. ” The decision to slash its local branches comes amid controversy , however , as the company 's labor union is accusing Citibank of falsely claiming its restructuring initiatives are for digitization expansion . Members of the union , however , have publicly denounced the company as merely searching for a veiled avenue to reduce its workforce.Citibank Korea had previously shut down 56 retail branches in Korea in 2014 following lackluster domestic profits that also resulted in the loss of 650 jobs under a voluntary retirement scheme.Carney , however , reiterated that Citibank Korea does not have any plans for personnel downsizing during the digitization restructuring and claims the hundreds of discontinued-branch employees will be relocated to its Client Engagement Center or to its face-to-face Wealth Management and lending centers.Regardless of the bank 's pledge not to lay off staff , the labor union has continued to criticize the company for plans to relocate employees to call centers , adding their doubts as to whether the company has enough openings to transfer hundreds of staff members. “ We will not be downsizing any personnel , ” a Citibank official told The Korea Herald . “ Citibank Korea will reinforce both non-face-to-face and face-to-face channels and our branch employees will go to ( either ) of them. ” “ Face-to-face channels include three more big-sized Wealth Management centers staffing more than 100 financial specialists in one branch ... they will also go to non-face-to-face channels such as the Customer Engagement Center and Customer Relation Deepening Center , ” she added.The Citibank official also stressed the company 's stance that the new service centers are not merely call centers and assured high-ranking personnel members and financial experts who previously worked in physical branches would not be reduced to answering phones , but rather be tasked with a similar job description via a non-face-to-face platform.Following Citibank 's bold move to weed out branches , industry experts are predicting the digital banking trend is likely to continue to spread across the country as domestic banks have also been ramping up their digital financing avenues.On April 3 , the country 's first branchless and internet-only bank , K bank , launched and attracted more than 100,000 new accounts in its first three days of operation.Looking to remain competitive in the expanding digital banking market , many major Korean banks have been strengthening their mobile capabilities . Last year , KEB Hana Bank introduced a text banking service , while Shinhan Bank established its “ Sunny Bank ” mobile platform in 2015 that allows customers to open a bank account without ever having to visit one of its branches using mobile-identification technology. “ Going digital is not just a push that is occurring the banking industry , it 's the entire field of finance , ” an official from Shinhan Bank told The Korea Herald . “ Going completely digital is the way of the future , there is no avoiding it . Our CEO continues to stress the importance of online platforms and going more and more digital , so going offline is only a matter of time. ” “ At this point it is not a choice , it 's a necessity ( to remain competitive ) , ” he added.However , not all commercial banks are jumping on the bandwagon of Citi and Shinhan . According to KB Kookmin Bank officials , while the company is certainly striving for greater growth in the digital banking market , they have no immediate plans to make nonphysical banking its biggest priority. “ Everyone in the finance industry is going digital and has been for the past several years , ” a Kookmin official told The Korea Herald , adding that banks ' policies and priorities differ depending on their customer base. “ Going digital or mobile is a way for us to provide more convenience to our customers . For those who can not stop by the bank physically , there are many other options , ” he added. “ But for us , we still stress the importance of offering our customers both offline and online banking options so right now we have no plans of focusing all of our attention on digital-only platforms. ” Kookmin currently operates more than 1,000 branches nationwide.By Julie Jackson ( juliejackson @ heraldcorp.com )

Jaroslav Halak has struggled through the first half of the 2016-17 season . The 31-year-old goaltender has fallen down the New York Islanders depth chart and was waived by the organization this past week . ( Jayne Kamin-Oncea-USA TODAY Sports )
51 SHARES Share Tweet Linkedin Reddit Mail
When the New York Islanders waived veteran goaltender Jaroslav Halak , media outlets made an automatic link to the Edmonton Oilers . It 's rumored Oilers head coach Todd McLellan has lost confidence in backup Jonas Gustavsson and thus relied heavily on starter Cam Talbot . However , making an acquisition for Halak is not the right move .
The 31-year-old Slovakian goaltender became the odd man out in the Islanders three-headed crease conundrum with Thomas Greiss emerging and a desire to keep the younger J-F Berube . The Islanders are currently 15-15-6 and eight points out of a playoff position .
Season GP W L OT SA GA GAA SV % SO MIN 2016-2017 21 6 8 5 669 64 3.23 .904 1 1,189 Career 388 206 123 42 10,809 904 2.42 .916 40 22,379
Halak was n't the whole reason for this , but his underwhelming statistics proved he 's part of the problem . However , there 's a lack of logic in a Halak acquisition for the Oilers .
Fiscally Irresponsible
It would be fiscally irresponsible to make a commitment to Halak , even if Oilers general manager Peter Chiarelli got creative and convinced Snow and the Islanders to take defenseman Mark Fayne .
The 29-year-old defender has one more year remaining at $ 3.62 million and is currently assigned to the AHL Bakersfield Condors . A likely buyout candidate this summer , the Oilers would be on the hook for two years at $ 1.16 million each if Edmonton went that route .
By acquiring Halak and his $ 4.5 million cap hit in a straight across deal for Fayne , the Oilers would be adding another $ 880,000 . They 'd have Halak on the books for another year , which means allocating $ 4.5 million towards a backup and a total of $ 8.66 million in the crease .
The Oilers need to move away from making irresponsible financial decisions . There 's a looming cap crunch coming to Edmonton with Leon Draisaitl , Connor McDavid , Brandon Davidson , Darnell Nurse and even Matt Benning needing new deals in the next two years .
There 's also the Kris Russell negotiations — whether you 're in favor or opposed . The point is , Edmonton needs the money they 'd allocate to Halak more than they need Halak .
Unnecessary Roadblock for Brossoit
Another issue in acquiring Halak is the unnecessary roadblock it creates for NHL ready prospect Laurent Brossoit .
The 23-year-old has been sensational for the Oilers AHL affiliate in Bakersfield and has been pushing for NHL minutes for two seasons now .
Brossoit struggled down the stretch last spring when the team traded Anders Nilsson and thrust him into the backup job .
It cast doubt and Chiarelli opted to sign a veteran backup , Jonas Gustavsson , to improve the team 's chances at moving up the standings over going with an unproven rookie . When training camp rolled around , Brossoit gave Gustavsson an honest run for the backup job .
GP MINS W L SOL SO GAA SV % 19 1068:23 7 8 2 2.75 0.908
Gustavsson has since struggled and there 's a clear lack of confidence from the coaching staff by continually going back to Talbot . There is a natural transition this summer when Gustavsson 's one-year deal expires for Brossoit to be promoted to the Oilers backup job .
Signing Halak only hampers this natural evolution and pushes Brossoit back down the depth chart . It 's an unnecessary evil when the youngster is clearly ready for NHL duty . If the team is n't sold on Brossoit , there are better options than an inconsistent goaltender with a cap albatross like Halak .
Look at Expiring Contracts
Talbot has proven himself this year to be a capable NHL starter and is on pace to play 73 games for the Oilers . Talbot has not played more than 56 games in a season and the last time an NHL goalie played more than 70 games was two seasons ago .
Last year 's leader , Jonathan Quick , played 68 games and was one of just six goalies to play 65 games or more . Starting goalies are starting to play less and the value of a reliable backup is rising .
If not Gustavsson , then the team should look for another backup with an expiring contract .
Goaltender GP GAA SV % SO CAP HIT Anders Nilsson ( BUF ) 11 2.47 0.925 1 $ 1.00M Scott Darling ( CHI ) 18 2.39 0.921 1 $ 600K Keith Kinkaid ( NJD ) 10 2.83 0.918 $ 725K Mike Condon ( OTT ) 17 2.41 0.916 2 $ 575K Al Montoya ( MTL ) 11 2.74 0.909 1 $ 905K Darcy Kuemper ( MIN ) 7 3.11 0.904 $ 1.55M Jonathan Bernier ( ANA ) 15 3.07 0.897 $ 4.15M
The last time an Oiler goaltender played more than 70 games was Curtis Joesph in 1997-98 ( 71 games ) .
If Edmonton truly is in the market for a backup , going after Halak is the wrong choice . There are plenty of other options that 'll cost nothing more than a mid-round pick to acquire .
BENGALURU : The state cabinet 's decision to accord minority status to Lingayats has triggered a debate in political circles , whether it will yield political dividends or boomerang on the Congress , amid allegations that the ruling party is driving a wedge in the community . The community constitutes 17 % of the total population in Karnataka , and is the largest chunk.The Lingayat community , particularly in North Karnataka , has distanced itself from the Congress ever since the party unceremoniously removed Veerendra Patil , a Lingayat , from the CM 's post in 1990 . For some time , they aligned with the Janata Parivar under the leadership of Ramakrishna Hegde , before moving over to the BJP , which they saw as an alternative force to the Congress. “ The issue was hanging fire for seven decades , and no government had dared take a call . Now that the Congress has taken a firm stance , I do n't see any reason for Lingayats not to support the Congress in the election , ” said a senior Congress leader who was associated with the movement.The party is also hoping that its decision to lob the ball into the Centre 's court will leave the BJP in a bind . “ Now , the onus is on the Centre . If it does n't give minority status to the community , it will definitely antagonize it . If it does , then we will claim the credit , ” said another leader , adding that inclusion of Veerashaiva-Lingayats in the recommendation has also doused discontent among Veerashaivas to a large extent . However , BJP leaders feel that though the decision may have pleased the Lingayats , it may not translate into votes since its benefits may take time to reach the community.Moreover , the state government has not been able to spell out the reservation benefits the community is likely to enjoy under the new status . On the ground too , Lingayats are not very concerned about the issue as they think it 's a gimmick by the Congress before the polls.However , water resources minister M B Patil , who spearheaded the separate religion movement , said Lingayats will continue to be under Category 3B and any increase in quota for Lingayats will be decided only after the Centre accords minority status to them , and considers the impact of this on existing quotas.Lingayat ministers in the state government have planned a mammoth rally in Bengaluru , where they plan to felicitate chief minister Siddaramaiah for according religious minority status to the community. “ The rally will be held within 15 days and we are planning to mobilize around 5lakh Lingayats . This apart , districtlevel conventions are also planned , especially in North Karnataka . This is to keep the issue alive till the elections , ” said a party insider.Though it looks like a carefully drawn strategy of the Congress , I do n't think it will stand to gain much in terms of electoral benefits . In fact , the party might lose some votes as there is a feeling among common voters among Lingayats that the Siddaramaiah government has divided them.—Harish Ramaswamy
8 BIG Mistakes Entrepreneurs Should NOT Make in 2017
Budding entrepreneurs – fancy starting a business in 2017 ? If so , let 's start 2017 a bit differently ; instead of looking into the future by predicting what 's going to be the trends in 2017 , I think it 's a better idea to look back and learn NOT to make the same business mistakes that many entrepreneurs made last year .
Here are eight big mistakes entrepreneurs should n't make this year . All can lead to failure or at the very least : failures that could have been avoided had the startup team planned more effectively , and took the time to listen and learn from those who knew better than them .
1 . Failing/refusing to plan
I 'm not talking about creating a bulletproof investor-style business plan that your bank or investors would expect . Maybe you 're starting a small business that does n't require you to go to such lengths . However , you must plan for success or suffer the inevitable failures caused by your own laziness .
Quite simply , you need to know who your customers are , where to find them , how much they 're willing to pay for your product or service , and finally : have the basic marketing worked out . And not just how you 'll market , but how much it 'll cost you .
2 . Lacking focus on the big picture
You want to move your business to the next level . Then the next level beyond that . And so on . Do n't worry about things like how your Yellow Page spread will look a few months down the road ( does anyone still use them ? ) Or the paper stock used for your business cards . These are small time decisions and worries that will curb your online business in its tracks .
As in the last point , focus on the customers and where the money 's going to come from . Without both , nobody 's going to give a lick about the background used on your social media profiles , or how pretty the vinyls are on your company SUV .
3 . Ignoring the MONEY
Or worse , dreaming about all the money you 're going to make instead of nailing down the first two points mentioned . MONEY is your biggest concern , but not about how you 're going to go for a swim in your massive money vault like Scrooge McDuck every morning starting a year from now !
Know how much money you 've got , how fast you are and are going to burn through it , and where you can find more ( ie. , investors ) if you run out or something comes up all of a sudden ( ie. , lawsuits , bills , etc . )
4 . Pricing products too low
This one is utter insanity . Undervaluing your product to get it out to market is a big mistake . Worse , undervaluing it when sales are rushing in like gangbusters , thinking that upping the price point will halt those sales in their tracks is utter sacrilege ! Better to overvalue and have to pivot in a month or two , than to not make a profit and be forced to go out of business .
This is business 101 . Pricing is psychological . Sometimes crappy products sell for a lot of money . And your product is n't even crappy , right ? So do n't undervalue it . Learn more about the psychology behind setting price points for your products and remember to always harness the power of the number 9 !
5 . Thinking bad reviews about your service are just par-the-course
Nobody should have to tell you about the value placed by customers on the service they receive – before , during and after the sale . Usually , the biggest customer service blunders happen when the customer becomes unhappy and voices their issue – only to get stifled by a bad CSR or owner with too much arrogance for their own good .
Remember that your customers are everything . Without them , your business 's failure is imminent . Give them whatever they need to be happy with your product or service , without being a patsy of course !
6 . Being overconfident ( ie. , ignoring sage advice from mentors and experts )
Listen… You do n't know everything . And even those whose advice you covet most do n't know everything ; regardless of how highly regarded they are . You need to listen and not cover your ears saying “ la , la , la , la ! ” until they walk away every time someone tries to help .
Therefore , when someone who 's been where you are already tells you that you 're doing something wrong – that you 're missing a key element – that you 're going down the wrong path – that the market you 're trying to enter has dished out its last sawbuck – you need to listen .
You might not follow their advice , heck some of the greatest achievements have been born from those who ignored their naysayers . But , you have to listen and weigh whatever advice/criticisms they 're giving – very carefully !
7 . Over-advertising ( $ $ $ )
Spreading your advertising budget too thin is a key ingredient to business disaster . Unless you have a million dollar app being backed by investors , your advertising budget has to match your current profits . Period .
There 's more to developing an ad budget than a simple 10 or 15 % of current or projected sales . Follow this formula and do n't overstep your reach !
8 . Emulating the competition
We 've all heard it a million times . “ There 's no need to reinvent the wheel. ” While this is true , just because something 's working really well , or appears to be working well , for someone else does n't mean it 's going to work for you . Worse , maybe your competitor , who was successful for a long time , has started doing something really stupid lately such as lowering their prices way too low , or offering a buy one , get one free when their margins wo n't cover such a deal .
Only copy something that someone else is doing after you 've performed an exhaustive analysis , taking all potential pitfalls into account . There are graveyards full of businesses who tried to usurp the need for creativity by copying another business 's bad ideas .

Even after nearly everyone condemned the white supremacy rally in Charlottesville , Virginia , and have discussed ways in which to tackle America 's problem with racism , Fox News will continue to deny the fact that we do not live in a post-racial society . What 's more , one Fox News host in particular rejected the idea that America is racist while doing something incredibly racist .
On Sunday 's edition of Watters World , host Jesse Watters included some commentary in defense of Trump 's controversial silence immediately following the “ Unite the Right ” rally in Virginia , which resulted in the death of one woman . According to Watters , Trump did not need to address the issue of white supremacy because the “ left-wing radicals who have terrorized this country , ” were the bigger problem . To finish his segment , Watters said , “ America is not a racist nation , it 's time we stop acting like it is , ” while then looking straight into camera and teasing two incredibly racist segments which stereotype Black people .
The first segment accuses Congresswoman Maxine Waters and former National Security Adviser Susan Rice of “ siding with a North Korean dictator. ” Then , footage of Black men appears while Watters sets a segment about “ guys with guns threatening President Trump over food stamps. ” This may not come as a surprise , as Watters was once in hot water for an extremely racist segment that involved him walking around Chinatown and asking Asian people the most offensive and stereotypical questions , even for Fox News .

“ Hundreds and thousands of such display boards have been removed on the directives of ECP and the operation is still going on in every nook and corner of the ” . An official of ECP told APP that they have issued strict directives to all the political parties to cooperate with the district administration . He said that the District Monitoring Officers have fined Rana Amir Shahzad , the candidate contesting the upcoming elections from NA 147 for taking out a rally without informing the district administration and also for committing aerial firing in the rally . ECP monitoring team in Rawalpindi district had also removed illegal publicity material from nearly 140 points . To another question , he said the ECP had appointed as many as 592 monitoring teams throughout the country to monitor the election campaign .
He said that 99 , 297 , 130 , 51 , 12 and 3 teams have been constituted in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa , Punjab , Sindh , Balochistan , FATA and federal capital respectively to monitor election campaigns of the candidates both for the national and provincial assemblies . “ These teams will monitor election campaigns being conducted by the candidates and political parties to ensure strict compliance of the code of conduct , ” he added .

The developer of a proposed apartment complex with an affordable component at 553 West Ave. plans to challenge the Planning and Zoning ( P & Z ) Board 's Oct. 3 approval with conditions .
The board voted 6-2 to approve the project 's special permit and site plan with the conditions that the required number of affordable units be 40 % , instead of the 30 % maximum required under the state 's 8-30g law that regulates such projects . Plans call for two buildings containing a total of 342 units and two parking garages with 512 total spaces .
Another condition requires the developer to install two traffic lights on Schoolhouse Road , one at each of the I-95 ramps , as recommended by the state Department of Transportation , and the Traffic Division of the Milford Police Department .
A third condition was meeting any requirements suggested by City Engineer Gregory Pidluski . A fourth condition was requiring installation of sidewalks along the property 's West Avenue frontage .
The final condition was suggested by City Planner David B. Sulkis and incorporated into the motion . Sulkis said the project needed to undergo a “ hydraulic and hydrological analysis for equal convergence and compensation storage ” as required by Section 5.8 “ Flood Hazard and Flood Damage Prevention Regulations ” of the city 's zoning regulations .
The motion requires the project to “ demonstrate that the encroachments shall not result in any increase in flood levels and the compensating volume of water displaced by construction in the flood area be comparable and incrementally equal when the base flood elevation is established at the 500 year flood level , as required by the state Department of Energy and Environmental Protection ( DEEP ) , and the Connecticut Department of Housing , ” said Sulkis .
Sulkis said both the Federal Emergency Management Agency ( FEMA ) and the Army Corp of Engineers also have a requirement that flood impacts be measured at this level .
These requirements are detailed in a DEEP document entitled “ Hydraulic Analysis Guidance Document , ” which may be read at ct.gov/deep/lib/deep/Permits_and_Licenses/Land_Use_Permits/Inland_Water_Permits/iwrdhydraulicguidance.pdf
According to the document , the DEEP requires a hydraulic analysis to be done , “ in any case where changes are proposed in a floodplain or in a watercourse which may affect the conveyance of flood flows , hydraulic information as outlined in this report is required. ” Among the conditions that would trigger such an analysis are bridge or any combination of fill and excavation in a floodplain .
Project engineer Alfred J. Mascia said at the Aug. 15 public hearing that said the project would require a FEMA permit because Beaver Brook , which crosses the site , is in the floodplain .
The main road will cross Beaver Brook and the floodplain on a 100-foot long bridge that he said would be designated for highway loading . The bridge would require a permit from the Army Corps of Engineers .
Since the project would be disturbing more than 10 acres of land , it also required a stormwater construction activity plan to be filed with DEEP . Mascia said DEEP would also have to issue a water quality certificate . The state Office of Traffic Administration would also have to issue a permit .
The 57.3-acre site is roughly cut in two by the Iroquois gas pipeline easement , which extends from I-95 to the Metro North railroad tracks . A total of 42.1 acres of the site , most of which is wetlands , have a conservation easement , leaving 15.2 acres of land that is not deed restricted .
The law overrides local zoning regulations , and allows the board to deny a project only if it can prove the project would pose a threat to public health , safety , or welfare , which would override the need for affordable housing .
Prior to the vote , board member Thomas Nichol asked Sulkis to explain to the approximate 40 neighbors opposed to the project who were attending the meeting and had spoken out at the three public hearings , the implication of the 8-30g law .
Sulkis said the city 's Design Office 25 zone does not permit housing , but under the 8-30g law , developers can put affordable housing in any zone , except for industrial zones that prohibit housing .
In making the motion to approve with the five conditions , board member John Grant said that all city departments approved the project and that the 8-30g law overrides local zoning regulations .
Speaking against the project , board member Rick Varrone said , “ I think this project is the wrong project for Milford and the wrong project for the area…I think this is an abuse . ”
Varrone and board member Thomas Panzella were the two votes in opposition . Board Chairman Scott Marlow recused himself from the application process because he is presbyter with Kingdom Life Church , which owns the property .
Following the vote , audience members expressed their displeasure . As he did at the public hearings , Frank Ellison , co-owner of the 8 Lucius Court , at Gloria Commons condominiums , shouted at the board , this time saying , “ You are going to put so much hardship on a 55 plus community . ”
Grillos to Challenge Decision
In an email response to the board 's decision , Attorney Thomas Lynch , representing applicants Michael and Lawrence Grillo , wrote that the requirement for 34 additional units to be rented at affordable rates “ is a huge financial hit . ”
Lynch wrote that the Grillos can resubmit the project on the grounds that these conditions “ affect the financial viability of the project ” and can attempt to negotiate a “ middle ground ” with the board .
If these negotiations are not agreeable to the Grillos , then they could appeal the conditional approval to the Superior Court . Lynch wrote that the 8-30g statute permits an applicant to appeal an approval with condition to the court if such conditions have a “ substantial adverse impact on the viability of the development . ”
At the close of the public hearing on Oct. 2 , Lynch said the city 's professionals from the police and fire departments , and the Sewer Commission all approved their portions of the project , demonstrating that the project meets the public health and safety standard of the law .

SYDNEY ( Reuters ) - There will be no Australian federal financing of a loan facility for Indian conglomerate Adani Enterprises Ltd to build a rail line to its proposed Carmichael coal project , a government frontbencher confirmed on Sunday .
Assistant minister for vocational education Karen Andrews told Sky News Speers on Sunday that financing a loan facility for the Adani rail line would not proceed .
“ Given the position that the Labor state government actually took to the last election and their election , there wo n't be financing from the Federal Government , ” Andrews said in the televised interview .
Adani planned to use a A $ 900 million ( $ 713.34 million ) government loan to help build a 400 km ( 250 mile ) rail line to connect its long-delayed Carmichael coal mine with a Pacific Ocean port in Queensland .
The loan was to come under the federal government 's Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility ( NAIF ) programme but was vetoed by the newly elected Queensland state premier in December .
There had been media speculation that funding may have flowed to the project via legal work-arounds , but in a further blow to the proposed Carmichael coal mine project it was made clear on Sunday that this will not happen .
Resource Minister Matt Canavan 's office confirmed there is no funding proposal other than the NAIF loan application which will not proceed .
Adani could not be immediately reached for comment , but told Reuters in December that it would develop the mine on an owner-operator basis .
It then cancelled an agreement with Downer EDI Ltd worth a reported A $ 2 billion to outsource the mine 's operation .
The proposed A $ 16.5 billion Carmichael project , which would be the largest coal mine in Australia if built , has attracted protests from environmentalists .
A number of lenders including Deutsche Bank AG , Commonwealth Bank of Australia and two Chinese state banks , have said they will not provide funding for the Adani coal mine project , given the opposition to investment in fossil fuels .

It 's official - Boxing champion Floyd Mayweather will come out of retirement to face UFC star Conor McGregor in a fight that has already attracted big bets in Las Vegas .
The fight will be held Aug. 26 in Las Vegas
Mayweather is currently an -1,100 favorite at the Westgate SuperBook , with McGregor paying back +700 .
The Westgate posted odds on the fight in February , with Mayweather opening as a -2,500 favorite . The early action was almost all on the underdog McGregor , driving the price down on Mayweather to as low as -800 .
On May 30 , the Westgate took a $ 50,000 bet on Mayweather at -800 , two weeks before the fight was made official . That bet would net a $ 6,250 profit with a Mayweather win .
As of Tuesday afternoon , 92 percent of the bets placed on the fight at the Westgate were on McGregor , including multiple $ 1,000 bets .
`` There 's going to be a lot of McGregor support , '' said Jeff Sherman , assistant manager at the Westgate , who oversees the boxing odds . `` A lot of tickets , a lot of probably $ 20 bets , $ 100 bets that might keep the price down , but I know you 're going to see , once the fight is officially announced , larger wagers come in and support Mayweather . ''
Las Vegas sportsbook operator CG Technology also had seen primarily McGregor money before the fight was announced .
`` The ticket count is a lot ( on McGregor ) to three ( on Mayweather ) , '' Jason Simbal , vice president of risk for CG Technology told ESPN on Tuesday .
The fight had already generated close to $ 100,000 in betting handle at the SuperBook .
`` Usually , you put these up in anticipating of a marquee event to try to draw some handle , but it 's usually the smaller variety , '' Sherman said Tuesday . `` We 've seen some dime wagers ( $ 1,000 ) on McGregor and the support that we saw on Mayweather . There are people who are betting a little more than usual for a fight that has n't been announced yet . ''
BeaconUnited , a New Jersey-based service sales and marketing agency for the CPG industry , recently announced that Arena is joining it to deliver branding and sales solutions for Walmart and Sam 's Club .

Democratic Candidate for Governor
We need a governor who will look out for everyone 's interests . The last eight years have been devastating to Milwaukee , the economic engine of our state . With rising crime and gun violence , struggling schools , income inequality , high infant mortality and incarceration rates , and streets filled with potholes , Milwaukee faces unique challenges that deserve the attention of our next governor .
The fact is Milwaukee has been ignored . Politicians in Madison , like Scott Walker , have abdicated their responsibility . They 're happy to take our tax dollars but not deliver for us . They focus on pleasing wealthy donors and special interests rather than addressing the needs of working families and their communities .
As a resident of the City of Milwaukee for most of my life , I have seen these issues first hand . Milwaukee sends more than $ 400,000,000 more to Madison than it gets back . I will make sure Milwaukee gets the fair and adequate funding it needs .
I will also change the culture of law enforcement in Milwaukee to stop the killing of young black men in our city . As governor , I will not tolerate it .
As governor , my primary focus will be to show respect and to listen to what communities are saying . I will work with them as a partner and collaborator . I will make sure that the city gets the proper attention from the governor 's office and that issues get addressed .
Several of the other policies I have proposed throughout the campaign will also address the problems Milwaukee faces . By investing in more health care , education , and infrastructure , while raising the minimum wage and reversing Walker 's anti-union laws , I will create the conditions for economic prosperity .
We also need to reduce mass incarceration . We need a criminal justice system that works for everyone , not just the wealthy and well connected . That is why I support the legalization of cannabis . Right now , two possession charges equal a felony , which effectively bars an individual from most employment for the rest of their lives . That 's ridiculous , and it 's why I will pardon everybody in Wisconsin jails , prisons , probation , or parole who had been convicted of a possession offense that does not involve violence .
Scott Walker and Madison Republicans have deliberately ignored the needs of Milwaukee .
Enough is enough . It 's time to vote for change . Together we can make sure that Milwaukee is one of the great cities in America , that works for everyone . I ask for your vote on August 14 and November 6 .
Matt Flynn is running against Scott Walker for Governor in the 2018 election . He is a Navy veteran , attorney , and a former Chair of the Democratic Party of Wisconsin . Learn more about him and his campaign at www.ForwardWithFlynn.com .

It 's a win for conservation this month , after researchers revealed that more than 4,000 online volunteers have completed more than two years of conservation work in the span of only two months . The volunteers are taking part in a giraffe tracking project through San Diego Zoo Global 's crowdsourcing conservation website WildwatchKenya.org , which launched in June .
Since then , volunteers have made more than 1 million classifications and retired almost 100,000 individual images from motion-activated trail cameras in Kenya—providing researchers with enough data to allow them to explore “ giraffe hotspots ” ( areas that are showing high volumes of giraffe activity ) , as well as identifying areas with no signs of giraffes . Conservationists said they are happy with the site launch , but a lot more work still needs to be done—and Wildwatch Kenya is expected to become even more valuable moving forward .
“ This crowdsourcing tool has been a critical component in our giraffe conservation work , ” said Jenna Stacy-Dawes , research coordinator for San Diego Zoo Global . “ With cameras still in the field and more data being collected , there are still over 600,000 images that need to be classified . We would not be able to do that amount of data analysis or find these trends in the images so quickly if it was not for our volunteers on the site . ”
The data is expected to help research teams determine which areas may need more protection , as well as investigate areas that giraffes are avoiding and what is causing them to avoid these areas . While the primary focus of this research is to study giraffes , the data also provides insight into the abundance and diversity of species present at the research sites—at times surprising scientists with never-before-seen evidence of other animal species .
“ We all believed that honey badgers did not venture within the Loisaba Conservancy area ; but through our past batch of photos , we found an image of a honey badger roaming the area , ” said Stacy-Dawes . “ It was a great find that may have taken us a very long time to notice without the help of our website volunteers . ”
The Wildwatch Kenya site was created using Zooniverse 's free Project Builder tool at zooniverse.org/lab , the largest online platform for crowdsourced volunteer research . Anyone wishing to participate can do so by visiting WildwatchKenya.org . Volunteers will be asked to identify what is pictured in trail photos—normally only seen by conservationists—by choosing from an animal list or indicating that no animal is pictured . Each image is viewed by multiple volunteers , to ensure that photos that are not needed are filtered out .
The crowdsourcing project is part of an overall effort by scientists to gather more information on giraffes . Earlier this summer , a team of conservationists made up of personnel from the Giraffe Conservation Foundation , Northern Rangelands Trust , Kenya Wildlife Service , The Nature Conservancy , Loisaba Conservancy , the Smithsonian Institution , Lewa Wildlife Conservancy , Senckenberg BiK-F , Goethe University and San Diego Zoo Global fitted 11 reticulated giraffes in the region with small solar-powered GPS tracking devices made by Savannah Tracking . This unprecedented project is now providing real-time data on giraffe movements , the size of their home ranges , where they travel during seasons and the travel corridors they use . This information could assist community conservancies in developing better strategies for managing their lands and livestock , while also expanding the frontiers of giraffe science .
Scientists hope this project , as well as other conservation efforts , will slow and eventually stop the continued decline of giraffe populations worldwide . Currently , there are fewer than 100,000 giraffes left in their native habitats—a decrease of more than 40 percent over the last 20 years . These numbers have alarmed conservationists , leading the International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) to change giraffes ' status last year to Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species . Scientists believe the startling downward trend is due to poaching , habitat loss , habitat fragmentation and disease . In fact , certain giraffe subpopulations have decreased so rapidly , they are now extinct in seven African nations . San Diego Zoo Global has partnered with the Giraffe Conservation Foundation , Northern Rangelands Trust , Kenya Wildlife Service and The Nature Conservancy , as well as other conservation organizations , to help reverse this trend in East Africa through the creation of community-based conservation projects with Kenyan pastoralists .
Bringing species back from the brink of extinction is the goal of San Diego Zoo Global . As a leader in conservation , the work of San Diego Zoo Global includes on-site wildlife conservation efforts ( representing both plants and animals ) at the San Diego Zoo , San Diego Zoo Safari Park , and San Diego Zoo Institute for Conservation Research , as well as international field programs on six continents . The work of these entities is inspiring children through the San Diego Zoo Kids network , reaching out through the internet and in children 's hospitals nationwide . The work of San Diego Zoo Global is made possible by the San Diego Zoo Global Wildlife Conservancy and is supported in part by the Foundation of San Diego Zoo Global .

Manchester United legend Gary Neville has blasted Liverpool for their 'crazy ' decision to allow Daniel Sturridge to leave for West Brom .
The England striker has joined the Baggies on a loan deal until the end of the season as he bids for a run of games and goals ahead of the World Cup in Russia this summer .
It means Danny Ings and Dominic Solanke are left as back-up strikers should first-choice frontman Roberto Firmino pick up an injury .
And Neville believes it was a short-sighted move by Jurgen Klopp and the Anfield hierarchy to let someone with Sturridge 's experience depart .

“ I 'm looking at that list of ins and outs and it 's gone under the radar , ” Neville said on Sky Sports ' The Debate show .
“ And I look at Sturridge . People are saying ‘ Sturridge is n't playing anymore , it 's not a big loss ' .
( Image : REUTERS )
“ Firmino gets injured for two months . Liverpool is in the Champions League and are trying to get into the top four… Danny Ings and Solanke .
“ Were they wise to let him go ? It just seemed a crazy one for me for a massive risk . ”
ABU DHABI - Influential Iraqi Shia cleric Moqtada al-Sadr has visited the United Arab Emirates , its official news agency said Monday , his second trip in weeks to a Gulf country after Saudi Arabia .
Late Sunday , Sadr met Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed , who congratulated Iraq on its victory against the Islamic State group in Mosul last month , WAM said . Sheikh Mohammed said he hoped Iraq would “ regain the role it deserves among Arab countries ” . “ The prosperity of Iraq reinforces the security of the Arabs , ” WAM reported Sheikh Mohammed as saying .
“ Experience has taught us to call for what unites us as Arabs and Muslims , and banish partisans of discord and division , ” he said . Earlier this month , Sadr called on the Baghdad government to dismantle the Hashed al-Shaabi paramilitary group , which is dominated by Iran-backed Shia militias and has played a major role in the fight against IS . He has also called on the authorities to “ seize the arsenal of all armed groups ” .
Sadr 's visit to the UAE comes after he made a rare journey to Saudi Arabia at the end of July .
Saudi Arabia and Iraq went a quarter century without diplomatic relations , which were cut following Saddam Hussein 's 1990 invasion of Kuwait .
But both countries hailed an improvement in ties in June when Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi visited the kingdom .
Sadr led a militia that fought against the US occupation of Iraq .
He is now seen as a nationalist who has repeatedly called for protests against corruption in the Iraqi government . His supporters have staged huge demonstrations in Baghdad calling for electoral reform .
General Motors CEO Mary Barra 's decision to put the company 's European operations on the block marks a turning point for the automaker that once prided itself on being the No . 1 vehicle maker in the world . If Barra succeeds in concluding a deal with French automaker Peugeot SA -- and people familiar with the discussions cautioned on Tuesday that many details are yet to be settled -- she will have delivered in an unexpected way on her promise to have GM “ disrupt ourselves ” rather than wait to be jolted by outside forces .

JACKSONVILLE , Fla. -- Jacksonville Jaguars left tackle Branden Albert , whom the team acquired in a trade in March , did not report for Monday 's start of the voluntary offseason conditioning program , a league source confirmed to ESPN .
The NFL Network reported that Albert is holding out for a new contract .
Albert has two years remaining on the five-year contract he signed with the Miami Dolphins in 2014 . That contract included $ 26 million guaranteed , all of which was paid in 2014-16 . Albert is due a base salary of $ 8.875 million in 2017 and $ 9.575 million in 2018 .
The Jaguars sent their 2018 seventh-round pick to Miami for Albert , 32 , who has n't played a full season since 2011 when he was with Kansas City . Albert , who signed as a free agent with Miami in 2014 , has missed 20 games over the past five seasons , including four last season .
Players are not required to attend the offseason conditioning program or organized team activities . The first two weeks are limited to strength and conditioning activities , and only strength and conditioning coaches are allowed on the field . Players are only allowed to be on the field for 90 minutes and can only be at the facility for a maximum of four hours each day .
There have been plenty of surprises to come from Cobra Kai , the new YouTube Premium series that reboots the Karate Kid film series launched in 1984 . First and foremost , it 's surprising just how good the web series is : It has drawn an overwhelmingly positive reaction from fans , strong reviews , and impressive metrics ( so far more than 36 million viewers have streamed the first episode , which you can watch for free ) .
The show also re-enters the lives of the original film 's main characters , not through the point of view of hero Daniel LaRusso ( Ralph Macchio ) but of his high school nemesis , Johnny Lawrence ( William Zabka ) . And much like a viral video from two years ago called “ Daniel Is the REAL Bully , ” Cobra Kai makes you sympathize with Johnny ( now a struggling handyman ) in the present day and rethink his character 's entire past . Take , for instance , the fact that it was Daniel who moved in on his girlfriend ( Elisabeth Shue ) or that Johnny was being emotionally tormented by the wicked sensei Kreese ( Martin Kove ) .
“ I think everyone polishes their past and sees it through their own lens , and we 're seeing it through Johnny 's lens , which I think is skewed a little bit , ” Zabka , 52 , told Yahoo Entertainment ( watch above ) this week when he dropped by our studios with Macchio and Kove . “ But I think coming in through Johnny 's eyes this way has been a fun approach into the universe of Karate Kid . It 's a smart way in . ”
Through Johnny 's eyes , Daniel is the villain . LaRusso , the former teen champ whose questionably legal crane kick defeated Lawrence , is now a wealthy car dealership magnate , a clever twist on the “ wax on , wax off ” training methods of his late mentor , Mr. Miyagi ( Pat Morita ) .
Macchio , 56 , admits he was surprised by the direction in which the show 's creators — Jon Hurwitz , Hayden Schlossberg , and Josh Heald — took his iconic character .
“ There was a decent amount that felt like not necessarily where I would have gone if I wrote it , ” Macchio said . “ Fortunately , I did n't write it , and Jon , Josh , and Hayden did .
“ So I had to let go and trust the fan fiction of it all . As far as being the auto king of the San Fernando Valley and doing these car commercials , I probably would n't have gone in that direction . I said , ‘ I see it 's funny , we just need to make it real . ' And we found that balance together . ”
Cobra Kai is now streaming on YouTube Premium .

BRISBANE - Frenchwoman Alize Cornet battled back from losing the first set to overcome seventh seeded Russian Elena Vesnina in the opening round of the Brisbane International on Sunday .
Playing in ferocious heat on an outside court where the on-court temperature climbed above 40 degrees Celsius , the tenacious Cornet wore down Vesnina 3-6 , 6-4 , 7-6 ( 7/5 ) in two hours , 37 minutes . She will now play Christina McHale in the second round after the American beat Italian Sara Errani in straight games 6-3 , 6-3 . Canadian Eugenie Bouchard 's hopes of turning her form slump around were dashed when she was bundled out by US player Shelby Rogers 6-2 , 2-6 , 6-1 . Bouchard reached a career-high world ranking of five in October 2014 but has slumped to 46 after a run of disappointing results in 2016 . She said earlier this week she wanted to use the Brisbane tournament to relaunch her career but she found the big-hitting Rogers too tough on Pat Rafter Arena .

Iran Focus
London , 6 Oct - A team of Iranian hackers used Facebook to target Deloitte , one of the world 's biggest accounting firms , according to Forbes .
One Deloitte employee fell victim to the scam in late 2016 at roughly the same time as a separate hack which affected Deloitte data in Microsoft 's Azure cloud-hosting service .
The hacking group known as OilRig , which as Forbes pointed out in July were believed to have been working for the Iranian Regime , created a fake Facebook profile for a beautiful , charming woman using the name Mia Ash .
In July 2016 , the creators of the fictitious Mia began getting a Deloitte cybersecurity employee and engaging him in conversations about his job via the website 's chat function .
As their relationship grew , the unnamed employee offered to help set Mis up with a website for her alleged business and then eventually , she convinced him to open a document containing malware on his work computer .
Though this malware did not infect the wider company network , it shows how easily the hackers were able to manipulate a security worker , who helped clients to defend themselves against similar digital attacks , and how they could do it again .
James Lewis , a former U.S. diplomat and cybersecurity expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies , said : `` This kind of thing is effective because men ca n't help themselves apparently . ''
Lewis continued by saying that we should ask why the employee was targeted and whether it was because of his job role or the company , although either option is worrying .
Lewis said : `` In a couple instances the Iranians have been really clever : they do n't go after the primary target , they go after the secondary ... the Deloitte guy might have been interesting only because of who he was connected to . ''
Although OilRig does n't do a lot of hacking outside the Middle East , this latest breach is very worrying .
Lewis said : `` It 's been a steady upward path for [ the Regime ] , starting a decade ago . They test on their citizens , they practise every week against Israel . They 've relationships with the Russians , Chinese and North Koreans , and in at least two of those - Russia and North Korea - we know they 've exchanged tactics tools and procedures for cyber . ''
Mia 's profile was creates using images and information stoled from a real-life photographer , Cristina Mattei , from Romania . The hackers also created multiple social media profiles for her so that a Google search would n't show up anything suspicious .
Indeed , SecureWorks cybersecurity researcher Allison Wikoff said that this was one of the most developed fake personas she 'd ever seen .
Mia was also used to befriend an Asia-based cybersecurity professional at Deloitte until February 2017 , when she also sent him a file- supposedly of photos of her- to open on his work laptop . Thankfully , this was caught by a malware detector .
MOSCOW-Google on Monday agreed to pay a nearly $ 8 million fine and open its Android mobiles to competing search engines in Russia in an antitrust settlement reached after two years . The deal with Russia 's anti-monopoly service ( FAS ) came after Yandex , the country 's biggest search engine , complained Google had an unfair advantage by pre-loading its search engine on Android phones .
“ We are pleased to announce that we have now reached a commercial agreement with Yandex and a settlement with FAS that meets the interests of all parties , ” said Google in a comment emailed to AFP .
For Android devices already in use in Russia , Google will work out a way for consumers to choose a default search engine after an update via a new widget that will be developed , the watchdog said .
The FAS in September 2015 considered Google in breach of a competition law after the complaint by Yandex of the competitive advantage for Google on Android phones . In August 2016 , FAS fined Google 438 million rubles ( over $ 7.8 million ) which was part of the settlement reached on Monday .
The arbitration court in Moscow approved the deal which lasts for six years and nine months , Russian news agencies said .
Yandex CEO Arkady Volozh called the settlement “ an important day for Russian consumers ” as “ millions of Russian Android users will be offered a choice of search engines . ”
If you ca n't get enough of the former FBI director Trump famously fired , you might be wondering how to watch James Comey 's CNN Town Hall interview coming up on Wednesday . Journalist Anderson Cooper is scheduled to interview Comey , who 's been giving one candid interview after another since his book was released earlier in April . Cooper and Comey should have plenty to talk about during the hour-long Town Hall , which airs Wednesday , April 25 at 8 p.m. EST .
Comey and Cooper will chat in front of a live audience at Comey 's alma mater , the College of William & Mary , in Williamsburg , Virginia . And luckily for you , there are a few ways to watch Comey 's CNN Town Hall interview . You can watch it live on television , or view it online via CNN.com/go . If you have the CNNgo app on a device , you can also watch it there . And , of course , if you do n't have access to those resources , you can keep up with how viewers respond to the Town Hall on Twitter . Video snippets will surely be posted on the social media site as well .
Among other topics , Cooper plans to ask Comey about his very public firing , CNN reported . He will also ask Comey about his new book A Higher Loyalty : Truth , Lies , & Leadership , which was released April 17 . The book details Comey 's upbringing , his law career , and his tenure at the FBI . While critics gave the Comey memoir mixed reviews , users on Goodreads have so far rated Comey 's book more than 4 out of 5 stars overall .
Book reviewer Dan Sinker wrote for A.V . Club about what might be one of the most controversial sections in the book :
Comey 's commitment to ethical leadership gets muddied in the Clinton chapters . Reading about the decision-making process that led to his infamous letter that reopened the investigation into her email servers a week before Election Day is like watching a slow-motion train wreck you 're powerless to stop .
The FBI 's handling of the Hillary Clinton email investigation is a sore topic for many Democrats who believe the email distraction derailed Clinton 's campaign and potentially cost her the presidency . You can expect Cooper to grill Comey on this topic .
During the CNN Town Hall , Cooper may also ask the former FBI director about some of the truth bombs Comey dropped in the last quarter of the book — or as Sinker calls them , `` dunks '' on Trump . That 's the part about Russian prostitutes , `` golden showers , '' and Trump 's loyalty pledges , all of which were revealed to Congress and the public on April 19 in the Comey memos .
According to the memos Comey wrote , Trump denied the now infamous allegation that he hired prostitutes in Moscow in 2013 and watched them perform sex acts involving peeing . The Trump `` pee tapes '' are `` fake news , '' the president insisted , according to Comey . Russia also denounced the dossier as an `` absolute fabrication . '' You 'll have to wait until Wednesday to see if Cooper brings it up .
In response to the memos , Trump claimed they cleared his name from the Russia collusion allegations ( which they did n't ) and called the memo revelation a `` witch hunt . '' Trump tweeted on April 19 :
James Comey Memos just out and show clearly that there was NO COLLUSION and NO OBSTRUCTION . Also , he leaked classified information . WOW ! Will the Witch Hunt continue ?
CNN reported that Cooper will also discuss with Comey the Russia collusion allegation , which accuses the Trump campaign team of working with Russian intelligence to interfere in the 2016 U.S. election . Both Trump and Russia continue to deny the allegation . The news agency reported that Trump said at a press conference on January 11 , 2018 :
... there has been no collusion between the Trump campaign and Russians or Trump and Russians . No collusion . When I watch you interviewing all the people leaving their committees , I mean , the Democrats are all running for office , trying to say this that — but bottom line , they all say there 's no collusion .
Now that Comey is no longer employed by Trump , the ex-FBI director is pursuing other work . The Daily Press reported that next fall , Comey will teach a course in ethical leadership at William & Mary . Ethical leadership , as it turns out , is main theme in Comey 's memoir . Tune in Wednesday to the CNN Town Hall to watch Cooper interview Comey .
New Delhi : Commerce Minister Suresh Prabhu on Tuesday appealed to the WTO members to identify common ground for strengthening the multi-lateral trade body amid challenges being faced by it following the deadlock at the Buenos Aires ministerial in December .
Delegates from as many as 52 countries , including the US and China , are participating in the informal meeting of the WTO called by India amidst increasing protectionism in global trade .
India has called this meet to explore options to reinvigorate the World Trade Organization ( WTO ) .
Addressing the representatives , Prabhu said the meeting is happening at a time when WTO is facing multiple challenges including a deadlock which happened at Buenos Aires , Argentina , and systemic issues .
`` Most of you present here would agree that the multilateral trading system has contributed significantly to economic growth , international trade , development and employment ... If you value WTO and its contributions , then you should collectively agree to make all efforts to strengthen it . Inaction should not be choice for any one of us , '' he said .
There is an urgent need for reflection and political engagements on all such matters which are likely to have implications on the multilateral trading system , he added .
`` Our meeting today is an initiative by India to facilitate free and frank exchange of views on all issues of common interest as well as seeking to address the challenges , '' Prabhu said .
The objective of this meeting is to reinvigorate the WTO and `` we need to work together for achieving this objective , '' the minister said , adding , `` let us find the ways to identify common ground for strengthening the organisation '' .
He called upon the participants to focus on issues like providing political guidance to further work in the WTO and the way forward on development .
He said that in the absence of guidance at the last ministerial conference , the highest decision making body of the WTO , in Argentina , there is a need to provide collective political guidance on aspects such as matters where there are no work programmes .
The meeting comes against the backdrop of imposition of import duties on steel and aluminium by the US administration , and Washington dragging India to the WTO against export incentive programmes .
Although India has invited Pakistan for the meeting , it has decided to skip the conference .
WTO Director General Roberto Azevedo , who is here for the meet , has said : `` We are facing many challenges in the WTO and outside . Trade environment globally is very risky at this point of time . We will try to have an open and honest conversation at the informal WTO meeting here '' .
The meeting would also discuss the issue of appointment of members of the appellate body of the WTO 's dispute settlement body . The US has blocked appointment of these members , which would hamper its functioning .
The meeting has been convened by India in the aftermath of failure of the trade talks at Buenos Aires last year on account of differences among the members of the WTO .
The rich nations are forming groupings to prepare ground for pushing new issues such as investment facilitation , preparing rules for e-commerce , promoting gender equality and reducing subsidy on fisheries .
India has been keenly pushing agriculture issues at the WTO . It has also been raising its voice against bringing new issues , especially those which are not directly linked to trade , to the negotiating table .
The talks at the WTO 's 11th ministerial conference collapsed after the US went back on its commitment to find a permanent solution to the public food stockholding issue , a key matter for India .
The four-day conference in Argentina , which ended without a ministerial declaration or any substantive outcome , did manage to make feeble progress on fisheries and e-commerce by agreeing to work programmes .

Of all the diseases and illnesses , there are approximately 200 classified mental illnesses and of those , depression is among the most common , not just in the nation but on a global scale . As such , various treatments exist for individuals with depression to improve the chemical imbalance and help people feel better .
One of the more recent treatment methods to be marked FDA approved is transcranial magnetic stimulation also known as TMS . It was originally “ cleared ” in 2008 and has been making its way across the nation .
In 2010 , Dr. Bernadette DeMuri and her business partner brought TMS to Wisconsin .
“ [ We were the ] first in the state to offer TMS therapy , ” DeMuri said . “ We pioneered it here in Wisconsin . ”
DeMuri has been treating patients with mental health issues since 1991 , in that time she 's had a private practice , worked with Outreach Community programs and currently works as the Medical Director for the TMS Center of Wisconsin in Wauwatosa .
Over the span of her career , she 's seen the world of mental health evolve as different treatment options become available and as the stigma surrounding mental health started to dissolve .
Typically , she explained , when someone is diagnosed with depression their first option is the traditional route i.e . antidepressants and psychotherapy . However , not everyone responds well to traditional treatment , and this is where TMS comes in .
“ This is more of a second line because one-third of people do n't respond to the first , ” she said .
While studies have shown that the use of TMS ends in similar results to traditional treatment , it is considered safer , is non-invasive and is not reported to have any negative side effects .
According to NeuroStar Advanced Therapy , the forerunners when it comes to TMS , the treatment is as follows . Using transcranial magnets , the areas of the brain which control mood and that demonstrate a decreased brain activity are stimulated . Treatment lasts four to six weeks five days a week , during which many patients reported feeling better , sleeping better and living better .
“ In essence , ” DeMuri said , “ areas in the brain have decreased activity and we 're taking magnets and stimulating it . ”
TMS is available for all types of depression , including chronic . According to DeMuri , many people who have chronic depression respond well to TMS , with some returning every couple of years to undergo another round .
Roughly 58 % see an improvement , DeMuri said and 37 % retain remission .
In addition to new treatments , DeMuri has also a noticed a change in the stigma surrounding mental health . She believes this is in part thanks to the number of big-name celebrities who are stepping forward and openly talking about their battles with depression .
With the stigma slowly being lifted , more people , specifically the youth , are choosing to seek treatment earlier on rather than later and the symptoms are being detected sooner .
According to DeMuri , the general symptoms of depression include a depressed mood , a change in appetite , trouble sleeping or decreased activity , low self-worth and a feeling of guilt . Women typically tend to feel more anxious and withdrawn , but are more likely to reach out DeMuri said . Men may feel more agitated and restless , and may not reach out due to feeling “ unmanly . ”
“ This [ depression ] is a brain illness , not a character flaw , ” she said .
It 's important to know , that it 's okay to ask for help DeMuri said , because , “ We all deserve to be the best versions of ourselves . ”
If you or a loved one is suffering from depression , talk to your doctor , visit the TMS Center of Wisconsin or call the suicidal hotline at 1-800- 273-8255 . And remember , just like a physical illness needs to be treated in order to heal , so does a mental one .
Former Florida wide receiver Antonio Callaway , who some personnel evaluators consider as talented as any wide receiver in this week 's draft , tested positive for marijuana at the combine , NFL sources said .
Callaway 's new agent , Malki Kawa , said Tuesday that it was for a diluted sample . A diluted sample is treated as a positive test result under the NFL 's Policy and Program on Substances of Abuse .
Kawa did not represent Callaway during the combine ; he was hired two weeks ago .
Shortly after Callaway was informed that he tested positive , he and his former agent , Melvin Bratton , parted ways .
Antonio Callaway 's agent said the positive test was for a diluted sample . Kim Klement/USA TODAY Sports
Callaway was viewed by some teams as a potential second-day pick , and that was only because of his previous incidents off the field .
In December 2015 , a female Florida student accused Callaway of sexually assaulting her , but a Title IX hearing officer cleared him of wrongdoing in August 2016 . The woman and her witnesses boycotted the hearing because the university appointed an attorney who was also a Gators football booster to hear the case . Callaway was never criminally charged in the incident .
According to the hearing officer 's ruling , Callaway testified that he was `` high on marijuana '' during the encounter with the woman and stated that he was `` so stoned I had no interest in having sex with anyone . ''
Callaway also was one of nine Florida players last season who allegedly used stolen credit card information to fund bookstore accounts , and he was cited for misdemeanor marijuana possession and possession of drug equipment during a traffic stop by Gainesville police in May 2017 .
One talent evaluator said Callaway had enough talent `` to one day wear a gold jacket . '' Now it might be a challenge for Callaway to get drafted .
Asked recently about his past mistakes , Callaway said : `` I mean , I matured . I 'm past that . I do n't dwell on it or nothing . It happened . It happened , so I ca n't cry over spoiled milk . I was young . I was dumb . I was immature . I 've grown a lot , actually . Got a beautiful girl [ his daughter , Aulani , was born in February ] to look after , so I ai n't got no choice but to be a man . ''

Pyeongchang 's obstacles were both economic and physical . It is one of the poorest places in Gangwon , South Korea 's most isolated and least developed province , which shares a long border with the North . And though it is just 130 kilometres from Seoul , getting to Pyeongchang from the capital used to take hours on mountain roads that twist like “ a sheep 's intestines , ” as the locals say .
“ The entire town was out dancing , ” Lee , 22 , said of the day they heard the news . “ Before we started our Olympic campaign , few South Koreans , much less any foreigners , even knew we existed . ”
That first bid for the 2010 Games failed , as did a second bid to host in 2014 , but the International Olympic Committee finally gave Pyeongchang , population 43,000 , the nod for the 2018 Winter Games , which open this week . It was a victory for those who never stopped believing in the obscure little town , one of the most unlikely hosts of the Games in Olympic history .
Their enthusiasm notwithstanding , the bid hardly seemed promising . Located 80 kilometres from North Korea and the world 's most heavily fortified border , Pyeongchang was known as a mountain backwater that produced potatoes and cattle . The town centre was a nondescript crossroads , going to seed with “ love motels ” and karaoke bars . The area had two ski resorts , but they struggled to muster enough snow to attract visitors .
PYEONGCHANG , SOUTH KOREA — Lee Ji-seol was in elementary school when her hometown , Pyeongchang , first applied to host the Winter Olympics . During a visit by Olympic officials , she recalled , her entire class lined up on a street to cheer and wave flags .
Despite the rebranding , a Kenyan man registered to attend a UN meeting in Pyeongchang in 2014 made headlines after he flew to Pyongyang by mistake .
Even the town 's name was a problem . Originally spelled “ Pyongchang ” in English , it was often confused with Pyongyang , the capital of North Korea . So in 2000 , the town added a letter , capitalized another and changed it to “ PyeongChang , ” though most foreign news agencies declined to use the capital C .
The provincial governor , Choi Moon-soon , called it “ the last place the government thought of when it thought of investment , ” adding , “ We hoped an Olympics would change that . ”
In time , though , South Korea embraced Pyeongchang 's bid for the Games as its own . The nation 's leaders were eager to build global prestige and saw the Winter Games as a chance to become one of only a handful of countries that have hosted a “ trifecta ” of international sports events . ( The World Cup took place in South Korea and Japan in 2002 , and Seoul hosted the Summer Games in 1988 . )
In a country where winter sports never quite caught on , only one other town with ski slopes , Maju , was interested in hosting the Olympics . Pyeongchang edged it out for national support , perhaps because it sits in a province that has been a major electoral battleground .
The government has poured $ 13 billion into the region , building a new bullet train and highway — and 97 tunnels and 78 bridges — to improve access to Pyeongchang from Seoul , as well as sporting facilities such as ice rinks and ski slopes .
While some residents worried about the impact on local forests , support for the Olympic bid has been almost universal in Pyeongchang : A poll taken at the time of the first bid showed nearly 94 per cent support , and it has not wavered .
Many believe the area 's future lies in bolstering tourism and are hopeful the Winter Games will help . The service sector accounts for 70 per cent of the local economy , in part because vacationers are drawn to the province 's scenic coast . But inland Pyeongchang has not really benefited ; it 's betting that the Olympics will change that .
In lobbying for its bid , South Korea used a potential handicap — Pyeongchang 's proximity to the North Korean border , in a region bristling with troops and weaponry — as a selling point . Holding the Games in Pyeongchang , officials argued , would promote peace between two nations still technically at war .
The North did agree to send 22 athletes to the Games , and the two countries agreed to field a joint women 's ice hockey team .
A third of South Korea 's 600,000 military personnel are based in Gangwon province . Many who were posted here as conscripts — all men in South Korea are required to serve about two years in the military — say they never want to see it again , so rugged are its hills and cold its winters .
Suspicion of North Korea is deeply etched here , as nowhere else in South Korea . The mountainous border is scarred with barbed wire , tank traps , landmines and guard posts . Hilltop loudspeakers blare K-pop songs daily toward the North , which counters by sending propaganda leaflets floating on balloons into the South .
Dreams of easing tensions and reunifying with the North one day are also more acutely felt here than anywhere else in South Korea . Many older people in the area came from the North as war refugees , settling near the border in hopes of returning quickly once the Koreas were reunified .
“ Our dream is to one day take the train to go to North Korea and all the way across Siberia and to Berlin , ” said Noh Yeon-su , curator of the DMZ Museum , referring to roads and rail lines that stop at the border , essentially making South Korea an island .
The province is also home to the Peace Dam , a towering structure built on the Han River because of fears that another dam upstream in North Korea might release a killer flood , by accident or on purpose .
But Choi , the governor , shrugs off such concerns .
“ Those of us who live here are not afraid of North Korea because the North , despite all its missile tests and bombast , does n't have an ability to fight a war , ” he said . The economic output of his province , the South 's poorest , he noted , exceeds that generated by all of North Korea .
He added , “ The happiest thing about the Olympics is that when foreigners see the Games taking place here , we can shake off our stigma as a dangerous place . ”
A THATCHAM man has been given a suspended prison sentence following a domestic violence attack .
Twenty-six-year-old Lucian Barnea , of The Turnery , denied assaulting Alana Wilkins by beating her at his home address on April 1 .
But he was convicted by Reading magistrates on Monday , May 14 .
The court ordered pre-sentence reports to be prepared and Mr Barnea was meanwhile released on conditional bail .
At a sentencing hearing on Thursday , May 17 , Mr Barnea was sentenced to eight weeks in prison , suspended for 18 months .
Mr Barnea was also ordered to complete a ‘ building better relationships ' programme and to undergo a period of supervision .
Furthermore the court ordered him to pay £150 compensation to Ms Wilkins plus £350 costs .
Finally , the court imposed a restraining order on Mr Barnea forbidding him from contacting her , either directly or indirectly .
The order will last indefinitely .

ISLAMABAD - Opposition Leader in National Assembly Syed Khurshid Shah said on Friday that he was making efforts in consultation with Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi and all political parties to soon finalize an ‘ acceptable ' name for the slot of National Accountability Bureau chairman .
Speaking to journalists here after meeting PM Abbasi , Shah said there was no deadlock over the new NAB chief and he was hopeful of consensus over a name soon . “ There is no rush . I had a detailed meeting with the PM today and we are moving positively . The issue will be resolved within days , ” he said .
Shah said the names forwarded by the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf and other parties were also being considered . “ We are aiming for consensus , ” he said .
The Pakistan People 's Party veteran has held several meetings with the premier over the appointment of a new NAB chief as the incumbent bureau chief Qamar Zaman Chaudhry retires on October 10 .
The PTI-led opposition parties have shown no confidence in Shah and have been trying to topple him as the opposition leader . Under the constitution , the opposition leader and the prime minister finalize the NAB chief 's appointment through consultations . They also consult to form the caretaker government to conduct the general election .
Imran Khan 's PTI has , however , failed to name its candidate to replace Shah . The PTI made a loose alliance with the Muttahida Qaumi Movement to elect its own leader of the opposition but several smaller opposition parties refused to support the move . The MQM had agreed to support PTI Vice Chairman Shah Mehmood Qureshi as the next opposition leader . The PTI later said they had not yet nominated Qureshi .
The smaller parties including the Pakistan Muslim League-Quaid , the Jamaat-e-Islami , the Qaumi Watan Party and the Awami National Party maintained there was no reason to change the opposition leader .
Amid all this , former president Asif Ali Zardari said Khan 's bid to change the leader of the opposition in the National Assembly will ‘ remain a dream ' .
In the National Assembly , the PTI has 32 members and the MQM has 24 seats . The PPP enjoys the support of 47 legislators of the party and also has the backing of some smaller groups . Some lawmakers of the PTI and the MQM , however , may not vote for the new opposition leader due to differences with the respective party leaderships .
There were reports that Maulana Fazlur Rehman led Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam-Fazal – a government ally – with 13 members can shift benches to save Shah in case the PTI wins enough numbers .
Shah said his meeting with PM Abbasi lasted for one hour and 10 minutes and the two seriously discussed the candidates for the NAB 's top slot .
The government has proposed Intelligence Bureau chief Aftab Sultan , Rehman Hussain Jafri and Ijaz Chaudhry as its candidates . Shah has floated the name of Muhammad Khokhar , Javed Iqbal and former secretary Election Commission Ishtiaq Ahmed Khan . The PTI has named Shoaib Suddle , Falak Sher and Arbab Shahzad as its nominees .

SHAFQAT ALI
The State Street Corporation , a financial services company that put the `` Fearless Girl '' statue on Wall Street to promote the importance of women working in corporate leadership roles , will pay $ 5 million after an investigation found that it underpaid female and black executives .
The company denies any wrongdoing , but will pay as part of a settlement with the Department of Labor . Law360 reported on the payout earlier this week , and Bloomberg posted the text of the conciliation agreement online .
The Department of Labor investigation found `` statistically significant '' differences in the pay given women and men in leadership roles at the firm , as well as between the compensation of black and white employees . The differences persisted when the investigators accounted for `` legitimate factors , '' the Department of Labor says .
A spokeswoman for the company tells NPR the investigation , which began in 2012 , examined executive pay at the company 's Boston headquarters in 2010 and 2011 . In an official statement , the company says it `` disagreed with '' the findings of the investigation but `` made a decision to bring this six-year-old matter to resolution and move forward . ''
State Street is `` committed to equal pay practices , '' the company 's statement continued .
State Street Corporation commissioned the Fearless Girl statue on Wall Street in honor of International Women 's Day this year .
The `` confident young '' girl is staring down the famous Charging Bull statue — much to the chagrin of Arturo Di Modica , that statue 's sculptor , who says it unacceptably alters the meaning of his work .
The statuary stand-off gained a new participant for a few hours this spring , when a small pug statue lifted its leg beside the Fearless Girl 's foot .
After installing the statue , State Street said the piece of art sent a `` powerful message . '' `` [ O ] ur goal was to raise awareness and drive a conversation around the need to improve gender diversity in corporate leadership roles , '' the company wrote . It also shared advice on how to increase the representation of women on corporate boards .
The statue had a mixed reaction from the start .
In March , NPR 's Rose Friedman reported that some people were charmed by it , but others — like economist Sylvia Ann Hewlett — had fundamental objections . Hewlett did n't criticize State Street itself ; she called it more progressive than many of its competitors . But the statue ...
`` Please do n't depict American womanhood as a cute 9-year-old , '' Hewlett told Rose . `` The choice of portraying the fierce female as someone who is immature , as someone who has n't tangled with the world , is a little bit of a travesty . ''
Taking Salt In Your Food
by Dr. Harold Gunatillake
Do you know how much of salt you consume daily in your food , including from sauces , salad dressings , pickles , cheeses and restaurant food among others ? There is much salt in your processed foods , canned soups canned tomato sauce , deli meats , smoked fish and dry fish , lunu miris and seeni sambol and all that . Some individuals further add more table salt at the dining table , quite a common habit we see . Do you know that one cup of self-rising wheat flour has heaps of sodium as baking soda and salt ? This means that all baked goods you eat ; including bread , pasta has a lot of hidden salt .
Your body needs salt for your muscles , tissues , nerves and circulatory system . Sodium helps to sustain your blood pressure , blood volume and required in the body fluids-intra-and extra cellular to maintain electrolyte balance .
Your body needs only 1,500 mg per day and that is less than a teaspoon of salt.Most of us get more than 3,500 mg of sodium in salt per day- about one and a half teaspoons of salt . To limit your salt requirement , the easiest way is to eat more home-cooked meals Why should you restrict your salt intake ? The commonest cause of high blood pressure in a community is caused by eating too much of salt innocently without knowing the consequences . Your blood gets thicker , increases in volume within the arteries , and the heart has to pump with more effort to distribute oxygenated blood to the body . The dangers of having high blood pressure are stroke , kidney problems , heart failure and heart attacks . Remember that high blood pressure has no symptoms till late stages and it is called a silent killer-not wrong .
Salt have an impact on your brain function . According to a 2011 Canadian Study on 1,200 more sedentary adults , those taking a high sodium diets had a higher chance of cognitive decline such as perceiving , knowing or remembering than those who took less salt in their daily food .
Those individuals who participate in physical activity sweat out more salt and they could be exempted from salt restrictions .
Some say sea salt and kosher salt have less sodium chloride , and that is not true though there texture and taste may vary . Table salt and kosher salts are obtained from rock salt , whilst sea salt is obtained by evaporating seawater . Himalayan salt is a rock salt found in the Punjab region of Pakistan . Chemically it is similar to table salt .
Look at the nutritional facts labels and check the amount of salt in the product before you consider .
You need to add more lemon , balsamic vinegar and spice up your food when reducing salt in your food to maintain a favourable flavour .
Despite some critics worrying the franchise might be running out of gas , The Fate of the Furious beat out Star Wars : The Force Awakens this weekend to give it the strongest worldwide debut of all time . Still , it 's important for any franchise , no matter how successful , to continually reinvent itself , which is why the folks over at Funny or Die decided to reimagine the series with a new star at its center .
Beefy action stars like Vin Diesel , Dwayne Johnson , and Jason Statham have traditionally anchored elevated the films , but it 's comedian Jerry Seinfeld who headlines this new trailer . Cars , after all , are his specialty these days . Watch it above .
While it 'd be great to see some of Jerry 's jalopies chugging alongside the series ' fleet of sports cars , it 's more than likely that Seinfeld wo n't be sitting down for Sunday dinner with Dom and the gang . “ What 's the deal with these Fast & Furious movies ? ” he 'd probably say . “ They used to be about racing , now they 're about heistin ' ! I ca n't keep up ! ”

SACRAMENTO , Calif. ( AP )  The agency overseeing California 's bullet train project is recommending a U.S. subsidiary of a German rail company to design and operate a Central Valley train segment in its early stages .
The California High-Speed Rail Authority 's board of directors will vote Oct. 19 on whether to approve DB Engineering & Consulting USA for the $ 30 million early operating contract . The company is the U.S. arm of Deutsche Bahn AG , which is owned by the German government .
Chinese , Italian and Spanish companies also competed .
The authority is tasked with building a high-speed train from Los Angeles to San Francisco by 2029 , a $ 64 billion project .

San Francisco Giants left-hander Matt Moore has struggled mightily this season and his job security as a starter may be in jeopardy .
According to Andrew Baggarly of the San Jose Mercury News , the Giants have considered moving Moore and his 5.71 ERA to the bullpen .
The 28-year-old owns a 3-12 record and 1.56 WHIP across 135 2/3 innings ( 24 starts ) for San Francisco , possibly the result of a dip in his velocity this season . Moore has made just two relief appearances in his 131 big league games and they both came back in 2011 when he was a highly-touted prospect in the Tampa Bay Rays organization .
Moore is making $ 7 million this year and is under team control through 2019 . His contract includes a $ 9 million team option and a $ 10 million team option in each of the next two offseasons , respectively .
The Florida native did pitch well in his most recent start on Sunday , though , striking out nine Washington Nationals while allowing two runs over seven innings .

Local musician will aim to break Guinness record at River Rock Casino Resort , starting May 7
A Vancouver-area musician named Spirit is on a mission to set a record for longest continuous guitar playing .
He 'll attempt the 116-hour marathon session at Richmond 's River Rock Casino Resort early next month , in a bid to raise $ 10,000 for the Canadian Cancer Society .
If things go according to plan , Spirit will play guitar staring at 10 a.m. on Monday , May 7 and wo n't stop picking until 11 p.m. Saturday , May 12 . Guinness-mandated rules allow for a five-minute break every hour , and Spirit can bank that time .
“ There 's no ‘ if ' here , it 's happening , ” Spirit says in a promo video posted to the casino 's Facebook page . “ I 've already completed it in my mind . ”
CLICK HERE to watch the video .
According to Guinness , the record for longest marathon playing guitar by an individual is 114 hours , six minutes and 30 seconds , a feat achieved by Irish musician David Browne at a Dublin bar in 2011 .
After seeing video of Browne in action , Spirit set out to break the record , with a charitable twist .
Both of his parents died from cancer-related illnesses , said the former Surrey resident , who now lives in Delta .
“ After witnessing ( that ) and being part of that personally , it hit me , because it ( cancer ) could lie in my genes , ” Spirit says in the casino 's promo video .

For every day Spirit plays guitar during his marathon , Great Canadian Casinos will donate $ 1,000 to the cause .
The record attempt will include some challenges for Spirit , including washroom breaks and sleep deprivation .
“ I 'll always think of myself as a fortunate person , ” he writes on a “ Spirit And The Challenge ” page on the cancer society 's website . “ Why ? Because I have the opportunity to live my passion by performing music for a living and share this gift with others . As an ‘ Acoustic Live Looping Artist , ' I am excited about performing and growing as an artist , but also feel I should give back to society and to my community on many levels as I become more successful . This event will definitely be on a new level for me ! ”
When performing , Spirit is a one-man band armed with a modified acoustic guitar , vocal mics and an array of foot pedals . His live-looping method involves music created on the spot .
“ Everything you hear is live , ” Spirit emphasized in a 2016 interview . “ At first , people usually think , ‘ OK , it 's a guy playing guitar , ' and sometimes they 'll hear other things and wonder if they 're pre-recorded . Well , no they 're not . I build the songs in front of them , and some people get that and others do n't realize what 's happening , that I 'm adding layers . There 's a lot going on , and I think it 's pretty unique . ”

MOSCOW ( Reuters ) - Russia has issued a travel warning recommending its citizens think twice before travelling abroad , saying the United States was hunting for Russians to arrest around the world .
The Foreign Ministry statement warns Russian citizens that when abroad they face a serious threat of arrest by other countries at Washington 's request , after which they could be extradited to the United States .
“ Despite our calls to improve cooperation between the relevant U.S. and Russian authorities ... U.S. special services have effectively continued ” hunting “ for Russians around the world , ” the travel warning said .
“ Considering these circumstances , we strongly insist that Russian citizens carefully weigh up all the risks when planning trips abroad , ” the Foreign Ministry said .
It said more than 10 Russians had been detained in foreign countries with U.S. involvement since the start of 2017 .
By way of example , it pointed to at least four Russians arrested on U.S. cyber crime charges in Spain , Latvia and Greece . U.S. action against suspected Russian cyber criminals surged to a record high last year .
Seven Russians were arrested or indicted in 2017 in the United States and abroad , compared to an average of two a year in the preceding six years .
The ministry pointed to the case of Stanislav Lisov , accused of creating a computer virus that targeted customers of financial institutions , causing millions of dollars of damage , who was extradited from Spain to the United States last year .
It mentioned earlier cases as well , including the detention of Roman Seleznev for cyber crime in the Maldives in 2014 , which it described as a kidnapping by American agents .
The statement , published on Thursday , also warns Russian citizens that upon extradition they will face biased treatment at the hands of the U.S. justice system .
The U.S. State Department declined to comment .
The Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz government in Azad Jammu and Kashmir ( AJK ) presented on Thursday its budget for fiscal year 2017-18 with a development outlay of more than Rs22 billion , almost double compared to the current fiscal year 's .

EARLIER :
4 p.m .
Vice President Mike Pence is giving no hint of the controversy engrossing Washington as he campaigns for a congressional candidate in Pennsylvania .
Pence is urging supporters to have faith in President Donald Trump and other elected leaders who are out there standing with the president.
But the vice president isnt mentioning the ongoing investigation of the Trump campaigns ties to Russia . He is saying nothing about a House Intelligence Committee memo intended to cast doubt on the FBIs inquiry .
Republican lawmakers on Friday released a memo they wrote alleging surveillance abuses at the FBI . Trump declassified the memo earlier Friday .

Attorney General Jeff Sessions says hell make sure Congress concerns are examined about the FBI investigation into possible cooperation between Russia and the Trump campaign .
Sessions issued a statement Friday after Republican lawmakers released a memo they wrote alleging surveillance abuses at the FBI . President Donald Trump declassified the memo earlier Friday .
Sessions says he will forward to appropriate DOJ components all information I receive from Congress regarding this. Sessions did not elaborate , but the Justice Departments inspector general is tasked with investigating employee misconduct .
Sessions says he has faith in department employees but that no department is perfect. He says heis determined that we will fully and fairly ascertain the truth.
Sessions has recused himself from the Russia probe , citing his own ties to Trumps campaign .
2:30 p.m .
The White House says a newly released GOP memo raises serious concerns about the Department of Justice and the FBIs handling of the Russia investigation .
Press secretary Sarah Sanders sent out a statement saying , The memorandum raises serious concerns about the integrity of decisions made at the highest levels of the Department of Justice and the FBI to use the Governments most intrusive surveillance tools against American citizens.
Trump allowed the memo to be released over the objections of the FBI and Justice Department .
While shes critical of the FBIs leadership , Sanders says President Donald Trump is especially grateful to the hardworking rank-and-file public servants at the agencies .
Sanders says the White House stands ready to work with Congress to consider allowing the release of a memo prepared by Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee .
2:10 p.m .
Former FBI Director James Comey says a newly released Republican-written memo doesnt add up to much .
Comey asks on Twitter , Thats it ? 
He calls the memo dishonest and misleading and not worth the damage its done to public trust in U.S. intelligence agencies .
The memo was declassified by President Donald Trump and released Friday by House Republicans . It claims the FBI abused its surveillance powers in the Russia investigation .
Trump fired Comey last May .
The White House initially said the firing was due to Comeys handling of the investigation into Democrat Hillary Clintons email . But Trump later indicated it was about the FBIs Russia probe .
Special counsel Robert Mueller has been scrutinizing Comeys firing as he investigates possible obstruction of justice .
2 p.m .
The top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee is challenging the accuracy of a memo released Friday by House Republicans .
President Donald Trump declassified the memo Friday , and Republicans released it in an effort to prove surveillance abuses at the FBI .
Virginia Sen. Mark Warner says he read the classified documents that formed the basis for the memo , and they simply do not support its conclusions.
Only two members of the House intelligence panel , one Republican and one Democrat , have read those underlying documents .
Warner says the act of declassifying information could make it harder for the intelligence committees to conduct oversight and could endanger Americans overseas .
North Carolina Republican Sen. Richard Burr chairs the Senate Intelligence Committee . A spokeswoman says hes not commenting comment on the memo .
1:20 p.m .
House Democrats are angry about the release of a classified GOP memo intended to show surveillance abuses at the FBI . They say its an underhanded effort to protect President Donald Trump and discredit the investigations into Russian election meddling .
Democrats on the House intelligence panel had tried to block the memos release . They say it mischaracterizes the motivations behind a 2016 surveillance warrant on Trump campaign official Carter Page .
They also criticized House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes for not having read the classified material that formed the basis for the memo .
House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi says that by disclosing classified information , Trump had sent his friend Putin a bouquet. Shes referring to Russian President Vladimir Putin .
Democrats on the House Judiciary committee said House Republicans are accomplices to obstruction of justice .
12:50 p.m .
Attorney General Jeff Sessions is defending his deputy in the face of criticism from the president .
Sessions broke from prepared remarks in a speech Friday on human trafficking . He praised Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein ( ROH-zen-styn ) as well as the departments No . 3 official , Rachel Brand .
Sessions says both are experienced lawyers and represent the kind of quality and leadership that we want in the department.
Thats a departure from President Donald Trump , who was asked Friday whether he has confidence in Rosenstein . Trump said , You figure that one out.
The criticism stems from a newly declassified GOP memo alleging the FBI abused surveillance powers in its investigation into possible cooperation between Russia and the Trump campaign .
Trump said , A lot of people should be ashamed of themselves.
12:45 p.m .
The White House says President Donald Trump declassified the controversial GOP memo alleging FBI impropriety because the public interest outweighs any classification concerns .

Nunes says he hopes the release will shine a light on this alarming series of events and spur reforms that allow the American people to have full faith and confidence in their governing institutions.

TOKYO-A 87-year-old Japanese woman in a wheelchair has died after being stung 150 times by hundreds of giant hornets , a firefighter said Friday , as the emergency services stood by helplessly .
A swarm of hornets swooped on Chieko Kikuchi as she was on her way back from her care centre in western Japan , accompanied by a helper . The helper called firefighters but they could not reach the woman immediately as the swarm around her was too thick and they had no protective equipment . After the ordeal , which lasted around 50 minutes , the woman was rushed to hospital but died the following day , the firefighter said . “ It was an unusual operation for us , ” he admitted . The death occurred in mid-September but was only reported on Friday , making headline news on national bulletins .
A forestry agency official said hornets often attack people when their nests are affected . “ To avoid getting stung by hornets , you should keep away from their nests , wear protective jackets and use a wasp killer spray , ” the agency official said .
Some 20 people die from hornets stings every year in Japan , according to public broadcaster NHK .

PanARMENIAN.Net - Talks on the Syrian crisis involving Russia , Iran , and Turkey that were due to start in the Kazakh capital , Astana , on Wednesday , February 15 have been delayed by one day , Kazakhstan 's foreign ministry said without explaining the reason for the delay , Reuters says .
Syrian rebels cast doubt on Monday over whether they would attend the talks , accusing Russia of failing to get Damascus to comply fully with a ceasefire or take any confidence-building steps .
Kazakhstan , Moscow 's close political ally , said last week the two-day talks , to which United Nations special envoy for Syria , Staffan de Mistura , had also been invited , would focus on consolidating the Syrian ceasefire .
Delegations of the Damascus government and the rebels attended the previous round of talks in Astana in January but refused to negotiate directly with each other or sign any documents .
A new round of U.N.-backed peace talks is due to begin in Geneva next week .
The teenager who fatally shot 17 people in a Florida high school giggled and proudly proclaimed he would become `` the next school shooter , '' according to cell phone videos he made of himself just before the attack .
“ My name is Nik , and I 'm going to be the next school shooter of 2018 , ” Nikolas Cruz said on the videos , released by prosecutors Wednesday . “ My goal is at least 20 people . ”
At least one of the videos appears to have been made on the same day as the Valentine 's Day assault on Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School . Cruz , 19 , says he wants to become a school shooter for the notoriety it would bring him .
“ When you see me on the news you 'll know who I am , ” Cruz says with a smile . “ You 're all going to die . Pew pew pew . Yeah , ca n't wait . ”
In one of the videos , Cruz outlined his plan for the massacre , saying that he intended to take Uber to the school and eventually end up on an upper floor of the building so that he could fire down on fleeing students like a sniper .
Cruz did take an Uber ride to the school that day , but for reasons that remain unclear , he aborted the last part of his plan and did not fire from an upper floor . After shooting 34 people , he fled with other people , mixing in with the crowd before getting a drink at a nearby restaurant .
Fred Guttenberg , whose daughter Jaime was one of the victims , said he read a transcript of the videos but chose not to watch them , the Orlando Sentinel reported .
“ I already know what he did , ” Guttenberg told the newspaper . “ He 's evil . Repulsive . He deserves to be dead . . . He talked about how he was going to be someone now . It 's a level of thought that I ca n't comprehend . It looks , from the words , like the kid had joy . I do n't want to see the delight he took in planning the murders of our children . ”
Andrew Pollack , whose daughter Meadow was among the dead , said Cruz can now rule out an insanity plea , the Sentinel reported .
“ It just shows this kid was competent . This whole thing was premeditated murder , ” he said . “ This kid knew exactly what he was doing . ”
Cruz suggested that he was planning the attacks in retaliation for being treated badly , although it is unclear by whom .
“ I 've had enough being told what to do and when to do . . . Telling me I 'm an idiot , '' he said . “ In real life , you 're all stupid and brainwashed . ”

It 's no secret that our grandparents are the best cooks we know , just think back to that banana loaf , all those chocolate muffins and more importantly the delicious birthday cakes - which they 've had plenty of practice at over the year .
Now it 's time to share those ideas ... and this is the perfect book for the job !
The Nashville Predators had their hands full with the Colorado Avalanche in round one of the playoffs . What should 've been an easy win turned into six games of a heated future rivalry . It all ended in Game 6 , where the Predators finally flexed their muscles and put the Avalanche away without a shadow of a doubt . Five to zero was the final score and ended the series at four games to two .
Just because the Predators won the series does n't mean they were perfect . Some forwards were just plain bad , and the defense was exposed . What was considered to be the best top-four in the NHL was turned inside out by possible Hart winner , Nathan MacKinnon and some very mediocre Avalanche depth .
A lot of the blame fell upon P.K . Subban , especially for his poor play on MacKinnon 's incredible assist in Game 5 . But this one mistake defined his image throughout the series . There seems to be an idea floating around that Subban is the third or even fourth best defenseman on the Predators , when in fact he 's their best player . That applies to this series as well , Subban was great and the stats show it .
Subban 's Offensive Contributions
The Predators ' defense had a weird start to the playoffs , as what was a strength last year took a while to get going this year . No goal was scored by a defenseman until Mattias Ekholm notched the winner in Game 6 . From there , it felt like a weight was lifted off their back and almost everything went smoothly .
Despite not scoring any goals , the defense was heavily involved in the offense . They totaled 13 points at even strength between the top four alone , as Alexei Emelin and Matt Irwin were held off the scoresheet . Subban had three of the 13 , all assists and two being primary . Other than that , he did his fair share in the offensive zone . For reference , I 'm using individual Corsi created ( ICC ) , individual Fenwick created ( IFC ) , and shots on net .
While Subban produced less than two shots per game , he produced three shot attempts . That 's awesome for any player , let alone a defenseman . While his Fenwick created is n't as great , it 's nice to know that he 's making his attempts count by not shooting into the blocking players . Overall , he had the third best Corsi created and Fenwick created and produced the second most shots by a Predators defenseman .
When accounting all strengths , including the power play , Subban 's numbers do n't jump too far . He has the same amount of points , but moves from third in Corsi and Fenwick produced to second , so that 's kind of neat . The Predators are n't exactly good on the power play , so it 's nice to see him producing something on it . As far as individual efforts go , Subban produced some of the best .
Subban Setting the Pace
Possession was a big factor in the Predators ' victory . As the series went on , their puck control left the Avalanche tired and depleted . Subban was a big part of that as he dominated shot attempts and just about every other possible metric including shot attempt percentage ( Corsi % ) , unblocked shot attempt percentage ( Fenwick ) , scoring chance percentage ( SC % ) , high danger chance percentage ( HDC % ) , and goal percentage ( Goal % ) . Once again , all stats are at even strength .
This is a coach 's dream . Peter Laviolette gave his star some easier talent matchups and Subban made the Avalanche pay . Not only are the numbers above the average 50 % , but all percentages are in elite territory . In fact , he is top five in all of these categories among defensemen who played over 100 minutes in the playoffs ( I made the cut off at 100 minutes to weed out the third pairing defensemen ) . The only player he 's second to on the Predators is Ekholm , who spent the majority of his minutes with Subban .
If Subban can keep these numbers going , with or without Ekholm , the Predators will go far . He 's so good on both offense and defense that his contributions are impossible to predict . His ability to read a play and immediately React has killed odd man rushes before they even happen . While the Avalanche were the best team in the first round in terms of creating chances off the rush , those chances rarely came against Subban because he and Ekholm used their physicality and mental edge to shut down the first pass . The pair ate tough minutes together and came out on top in no small part due to Subban 's ability .
Defensemen Have to Defend
Subban dominated every stat , yet is unfairly blamed for most of the Predators ' shortcomings despite only having the one really bad play . The fact is that he takes very calculated risks and they pay off most of the time , but when they do n't , they 're extremely visible . Subban does so much away from the puck that a lot of his contributions go unnoticed . Do you know why Avalanche fans were chanting “ Subban sucks ” ? It 's not racism but because he was constantly shutting down the Av 's best players and getting under their skin with an effective , albeit somewhat dirty edge .
Playing with this edge has given the Predators an advantage . It takes the opposition off their game and draws penalties . In fact , Subban drew the most penalties of any Predators defenseman with three while only taking two minors , good for third least on the team . So no , he was not a liability but actually a net positive in terms of penalty minutes . Very few players can claim that , but those who do are often recognized for their skill .
Besides penalties , he was great on defense . He only gave the puck away twice in the series , tied for second least on the team while also snatching Avalanche turnovers three times , the best on the Predators ' defense . He was a puck-hawk that dominated the blue line and broke up two or three zone entries per game , by my count .
Gone are the days of bone bruising shutdown defensemen like Chris Pronger and Scott Stevens and in their stead are smaller , more agile defenders like Subban . While he was n't a physically dominating presence , he threw the second most hits of any one of the defense with 11 . That 's only two behind the leader , Emelin , who 's known for his ability to hit .
All in all , he was just as effective in the defensive zone as he was in the offensive zone .
Give P.K . Subban His Due
It does n't matter whether or not you look at fancy or simple analytics , Subban shines . He 's a positive player for the Predators and does more for their success than anyone realizes . Although he was inexplicably kept away from MacKinnon for certain games , he dominated whoever he was up against .
Finding a player who does so much for a team is rare , and it 's terrible that people are not celebrating him . I suspect that no one will truly understand Subban 's impact until he 's out for a long period of time . Quite simply , he is the “ X Factor ” that pushes teams over the top , and even if his contributions are n't visible , it does n't mean they 're not there . Ekholm would probably be the best testament to that , as his stats have exploded since Subban arrived .
If you love him for his on-ice play , you 're justified . And if you hate him for crossing a line every once in a while , that 's fine as well . But to think Subban 's not as good as Roman Josi , Ryan Ellis , or Ekholm is wrong . The superstar defenseman has proved himself time and time again , and I will write as many articles as are needed to defend him and his play . I just hope that one day we can treasure him the way 30 other fanbases wish they could .

Xander Schauffele looks for repeat win in West Virginia
Associated Press FOLLOW NEWS News 5 // 05 Jul 2018 , 00:26 IST SHARE Share Options × Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Reddit Google+ Email
Decisions by most of the world 's elite golfers to skip the PGA Tour 's stop in West Virginia have been a boost for younger players like Xander Schauffele .
Schauffele had a one-stroke victory over Robert Streb at The Greenbrier resort last season , which ended with the 24-year-old from San Diego winning the Tour Championship and earning Rookie of the Year honors .
This year , nearly all of the two dozen rookies on the tour are in the field at A Military Tribute at The Greenbrier , which starts Thursday on the Old White TPC in White Sulphur Springs , West Virginia .
Chances are good that one or more of them could be near the top of the leaderboard . Four of the tournament 's seven champions have been first-time winners , including three rookies .
Schauffele likes his chances , too .
He is part of the successful high school class of 2011 that includes Jordan Spieth , Justin Thomas and Daniel Berger . Schauffele pointed out that Spieth won the John Deere Classic in 2013 and 2015 , Thomas won in Malaysia in 2015 and 2016 , and Berger at the St. Jude Classic in 2016 and 2017 .
`` I feel like I want to join that group , '' Schauffele said Wednesday .
But Schauffele has missed the cut in three of his last four tournaments after finishing tied for second at The Players Championship .
At No . 24 in the world , he 's among five players ranked in the top 30 at The Greenbrier . The others are Bubba Watson ( No . 13 ) , Phil Mickelson ( No . 20 ) , Webb Simpson ( No . 21 ) and Brian Harman ( No . 26 ) . Five from the top 15 in the FedEx Cup are competing .
Watson , a three-time winner this season , and Mickelson own vacation homes at The Greenbrier Sporting Club . The Greenbrier Classic , typically held around Independence Day , was renamed last month in honor of the nation 's active and past members of the military , who are being given free admission .
`` It would be a huge accomplishment to win here in front of my home crowd , '' Watson said . `` What a dream that would be , my dad was in the military so now we 've got the name of the tournament . It just would mean a lot for my family to honor my late dad . ''
It 's the first tournament for Mickelson since the U.S. Open , when he intentionally violated golf rules by hitting a moving ball on the 13th green in the third round . He later apologized , saying his anger and frustration got the best of him .
The West Virginia stop could see a change when the PGA Tour reveals its full schedule this month for the next FedEx Cup season . The tournament at Sam Snead 's former playground in White Sulphur Springs is under contract through 2021 .
Watson , for one , would n't mind seeing a schedule change . From a business standpoint , he said the Fourth of July holiday always is a hectic time at The Greenbrier , so moving the tournament to later in the year , especially with the area 's spectacular fall foliage on display , would give the resort yet another busy week .
`` I 've always thought that the fall would be great , '' he said .
Up for grabs this week are four spots in the British Open at Carnoustie starting July 19 . Those will go to players not already exempt among the top 12 finishers in West Virginia .
All past winners are in the field . So is Abraham Ancer , who was tied for the lead entering the final round of last week 's Quicken Loans National . He finished tied for fourth .
Nineteen-year-old Norman Xiong is playing in his first tournament as a professional . He won the Haskins Award as the nation 's top college golfer during his sophomore year at Oregon , earning him an exemption at The Greenbrier .
`` It 's pretty low-key here , so my mind 's pretty settled and I 'm just trying to prepare the best I can for the upcoming week , '' Xiong said . `` It 's a different stage . It 's kind of a new beginning . I do n't know too many guys out here . Hopefully soon I can make some friends . ''

News outlets report that passengers had already boarded the Majesty of the Seas when their Monday afternoon departure from Port Canaveral was delayed .
Coast Guard spokesman Ryan Dickinson said the delay had to do with the life-saving equipment on board , not the ship 's engine . He did not give further details .
Royal Caribbean apologized to the delayed guests on Twitter and asked for patience .

Federer looks on after his defeat in the Coupe Rogers final to Alexander Zverev ( Getty Images SportMinas Panagiotaki ) s
Roger Federer has withdrawn from the Western and Southern Open citing a back problem . The world number three played in the Coupe Rogers final vs Alexander Zverev but looked to be struggling to move at times . The Swiss lost in straight sets to the German . Federer will be replaced by Lucky Loser Thomas Fabbiano .
World Number One Implications
Due to his withdrawal , Rafael Nadal will take over world number one this week in Cincinnati and will be the top seed headed into the US Open . With Nadal opening up in the second round , he has an over 300 point lead on the Swiss after Federer lost in the Montreal final . Nadal 's lead could bloom to over a thousand points should he win the title in Cincinnati .
Draw Implications
The main draw on the men 's side has thinned out considerably this year with the number of withdrawals . Federer 's withdrawal means there are only four top-ten players in this tournament , joining the likes of Andy Murray , Novak Djokovic , Stan Wawrinka , Marin Cilic , and Kei Nishikori who have all withdrawn .
Federer was seeded second in the tournament and no doubt that his side of the draw opens up massively . The likes of Jack Sock , Tomas Berdych , Juan Martin del Potro or Grigor Dimitrov to make it to a Masters 1000 semifinal . A dark horse who could make a run is Diego Schwartzman , who is coming off of a fantastic run in Montreal , making the quarterfinals .
Robotics specialists Sewtec Automation has completed a management buyout , backed by Endless .
The £22m-turnover business designs and engineers automated manufacturing and packaging systems for a customer base of global blue chip companies .
It relies on the team of 70 engineers to solve complex production and packaging challenges and meet the constantly changing demands of consumers and regulators around the world .
Sewtec is a market leader in its field and serves sectors including confectionery , food , pharmaceutical , personal care and tobacco . Exports make up 85 per cent of its sales .
It started life at the end of the 19th century as the design and development department of the Singer Corporation , the historic manufacturer of sewing machines .
By investing in research and development and attracting , training and retaining some of the best engineering minds in the industry , Sewtec is very well placed to capitalise on the trend of increased automation in manufacturing .
Andrew Ross , Director at Endless , said : “ For a business of its size and location , Sewtec has an impressive list of multinational customers which trust and respect its team of highly skilled engineers to come up with innovative solutions to some very difficult problems .
“ It is an inspirational Yorkshire success story and as a private equity house with headquarters in Yorkshire we are delighted to be supporting the management team at Sewtec with the next stage of its development . ”
The management team of Gary Day , Karl Conqueror and Paul Johnson led the buyout with the backing of Endless to help the business grow and expand into new markets .
Paul Johnson , sales director , said : “ We are delighted to be working with Endless and look forward to an exciting future together .
“ We have developed together a sustainable growth strategy that will allow the business to flourish further , while making sure that our employees remain engaged , satisfied and aligned with our vision .
“ Working with Endless ensures the business can operate in the future with the financial security that it has enjoyed in the past . ”
The vendor Bernard Meehan , the driving force behind the growth and development of Sewtec over the last two decades , will remain as consultant . He chose Endless over a number of other potential backers .
Mr Meehan said : “ I met with the Endless team in Leeds and was impressed with their friendly and efficient approach .
“ I am confident Sewtec is in safe hands . The fact that big multinationals from all over the world are coming to Ravensthorpe in Dewsbury to solve their problems is something I am very proud of . ”
Examples of projects recently undertaken by Sewtec :
• A household name in personal care products faced some challenges around the operation and obsolescence of one of its manufacturing processes . Sewtec , working with the customer , developed a laser-etching alternative , which resolved the issues , increased productivity and reduced labour costs
• A global healthcare business needed to create a more convenient method of self-testing for patients with long-term conditions . Sewtec designed and developed highly sophisticated machines capable of manufacturing biomedical sensors to implant under the skin
• A consumer products multi-national had to demonstrate that it could track and trace goods from production through packaging and into cross-border logistics to combat counterfeiters . Sewtec engineered a system to provide a unique identification for each and every item .
For Endless , this summer has been its busiest ever period since launching in Leeds a dozen years ago . The Sewtec transaction represents the 11th Endless acquisition so far in 2017 .
Darren Forshaw , founding partner at Endless , said : “ When we raised our latest fund , we wanted to expand our strategy to include more traditional management buyouts and with Sewtec we are delighted to have completed our fourth in as many months .
“ We are also seeing a lot of activity in our core area of transformational investment and it looks like 2017 is going to be a record year for Endless both for new investments and exits . ”
Endless was advised on the acquisition by law firm Squire Patton Boggs and the tax team at KPMG .
The sale side advisors were Mazars Corporate Finance and law firm Gordons .
Islamabad-The new academic session has begun with the old challenge for students regarding securing admission in model educational institutes of the capital , belying the concerned ministry 's claims of reforms in education sector .
Talking to The Nation on Monday , principal of a model college requesting anonymity said that 20 model colleges are facing immense pressure regarding admission of students in new session . He said that total of 422 educational institutes were working under the Federal Directorate of Education ( FDE ) and out of the total , 20 institutes – ten for girls and ten for boys – are facing immense pressure for admissions . He said that these 20 model colleges offer admission in new session beginning from grade Prep or 1st .
He said that a committee has also been constituted by the Capital Administration and Development Division ( CADD ) for monitoring the admission process but it has further confused the things . “ No criteria of admission process have been adopted by the committee and only lists of selected students are being provided to colleges thus putting a question mark on transparency of the process , ” the principal added .
He said that each college among the 20 top institutes receive around 180 applications while nearly 2,500 students are accommodated in the new session and rest of the students have to seek admissions in private institutes instead in the remaining public sector colleges due to lack of facilities , ” he added .
He said the principals ' role of these colleges has been limited this year which has also affected the admission process and they are unaware of students lists finalised by the committee .
The committee constituted by the Ministry of Capital Administration & Development Division ( CADD ) compresses Joint Secretary ( JS ) Alamgitr Ahmad Khan , Director FDE Dr Tariq Massod , Abdul Waheed , College Principal Tasneem Sher Muhammad , College Principal Ghazala Bashir Khan , Deputy Director FDE Muhammad Luqman and Assistant Director FDE Anjum Zaheer .
As per admission notice available with The Nation , areas were specified for the admission in respective institutes of the sector but admission in well-reputed colleges would be provided on merit .
The boys institutes include ICB , G-6/3 , IMCB F-7/3 , IMCB , F-8/4 , IMCB , F-10/3 , IMCB , F-11/1 , IMCB F-11/3 , IMCB G-10/4 , IMCB , G-11/1 , IMCB , I-10/1 . The girl institutes include ICG , F-6/2 , IMCG F-7/4 , IMCG , G-10/2 , IMCG F-8/1 and IMCG I-10/4 .
According to the principal , the committee should have adopted a centralised system for reviewing the admission process as there is uncertainty among heads of the colleges .
Talking to The Nation , Member Admission Committee Director FDE Dr. Tariq Masood said that committee 's role is to facilitate the admission process while all the admission tests were conducted by institutes .
“ The committee has a technical task to accommodate the students who were deprived of taking admission in model institutes , ” he added .
According to Dr Tariq , admission process is being finalised for grade prep and lists are being displayed . He said that infrastructure of 391 institutes is also being improved under the Prime Minister Education Reforms Programme ( PERP ) and it will help in dealing with the pressure of admission in new session .
He also said that 16,000 students are enrolled in evening sessions and they are also trying to get admission in the morning session .
Effort from both public and private sectors will be needed to impact the costs of regional housing
Last month two events in the region celebrated the rise of the tiny home .
Portland 's fifth annual Accessory Dwelling Tour featured 24 striking “ granny flats , ” that clearly are n't just targeted to grannies anymore . Following on the heels of that event was the Tiny House Living Festival at the Clark County Event Center . The recent ruling on Accessory Dwelling Units ( ADU ) by the Vancouver City Council on Aug. 7 has made ADUs a hot topic in local politics as well .
We applaud the city for taking a step to increase the housing supply . However , ADUs are one small tool in the toolbox to impact housing affordability . Vancouver loosened some design requirements and eliminated restrictions on owner-occupancy and on-site parking as methods for encouraging ADUs .
For some context we can look across the river where ADUs have been aggressively pursued as part of Portland 's urban growth planning . Portland did not really see ADU permits take off until 2010 when they waived System Development Charges ( SDC ) . In 2016 , Portland issued 616 permits for ADUs , which is 20 times the average number issued prior to 2010 . Total number of ADUs in Portland currently is around 1,900 , which is less than 1 percent of single-family residential properties in the city .
A few ADUs popping up will make a difference to the person that can generate some much-needed rental income – the grandfather that is able to live next to family and the young person who finally finds a place they can afford to rent . These are all good things , but they wo n't make a huge dent in our community for overall housing affordability .
Barriers to affordability in Clark County include land cost , availability of infrastructure to make the dirt shovel-ready , fees and increased holding costs due to the amount of time it takes to navigate the permitting process and complete a project .
To achieve big impacts on housing affordability requires effort from both the public and private sector . Solutions include rethinking infrastructure funding , simplifying permitting processes to reduce holding time , and empowering decision makers to act rather than languishing over minutiae and political status quo .
The bottom line is that we have competing land-use interests . We work within the Growth Management Act ( GMA ) framework to ensure we do n't become like Texas and Arizona with massive sprawl and unmanageable infrastructure . More regulations have passed since the inception of the act , including complicated requirements around stormwater , wetlands , and riparian areas and community choice laws like tree preservation . Collectively , we must recognize that all of these choices put pressure on land cost from a development standpoint .
Oftentimes our industry struggles with a perception problem . When our members are cast only as wealthy builders and developers seeking personal gain , the valuable insight that these professionals can bring to the conversation is neglected . Private business and public policymakers need to listen to each other and really hear one another to drive towards solutions . Achieving balance for our land needs is a complex and difficult task . It will take collaboration and compromise ; common sense and community .
Even ADUs , which are generally thought of in a positive light , are facing some backlash within Portland neighborhoods like Eastmoreland with the advent of higher density in stately , historic neighborhoods . With any land use , reality sets in when it impacts you directly . Thus , the “ Not In My Backyard ” cry rises that we so often hear around these types of issues .
Interestingly , there 's a new movement afoot called YIMBY or “ Yes In My Backyard ” that is very well described in “ The Unexpected Solution to America 's Affordable Housing Crunch ” by Carl Alviani in Quartz ( qz.com ) . As noted in this excellent article that outlines who are driving the YIMBY movement ( and it 's not developers ) , we believe that the primary solution to the affordability issue is supply . So , ADUs are a good start , but there is much more work to be done .

Could local people build local fiber backbones ?
Necessity has led Cubans to become do-it yourself ( DIY ) inventors — keeping old cars running , building strange , motorized bicycles , etc . They 've also created DIY information technology like software , El Paquete Semanal , street nets and WiFi hotspot workarounds .
Last June the International Telecommunication Union ( ITU ) adopted a standard for `` low-cost sustainable telecommunications infrastructure for rural communications in developing countries , '' L.1700 . L.1700 cable should be of interest to both DIY technologists and ETECSA .
L.1700 is a technology-neutral `` framework standard '' for optical cable so there are multiple commercial offerings like these :
The cables are strong enough to be installed without being threaded through a protective duct and light and flexible enough to be installed by supervised volunteers or unskilled workers . The cables can be buried in shallow trenches , strung above ground or submerged . ( For an example installation in Bhutan and more on L.1700 , click here ) .
Large cities like Havana have expensive fiber rings installed in tunnels and ducts under the streets . ( Google has installed that sort of infrastructure in two African capitals ) . Could a small town construct their own fiber ring using L.1700-compliant cables and electronics — creating a network like the one in the following ITU illustration ?
What role might ETECSA play in such a network ? At a minimum , they could provide backhaul to their backbone , treating the local government as a customer , but I would hope they would take a more active role — training local people , designing the local network , making bulk purchases of cable and electronic and optical equipment , etc . ( Current street net organizers could also play an important role in this process ) .
This relatively active role is reminiscent of a suggestion I made some time back for installing local area networks in Cuban schools or another for providing geostationary satellite connectivity as an interim step on the path to modern technology .
I 've been offering suggestions like this to ETECSA since I began this blog . My suggestions might be financially , technically , politically or bureaucratically unfeasible , but I hope someone within ETECSA or the government is at least studying alternatives that go beyond today 's slow , expensive and unreliable WiFi hotspots and the timid , obsolete home-connectivity plan foreshadowed by the recently-completed Havana trial .

ISLAMABAD - A special parliamentary committee was Tuesday informed that Rs180 billion of the circular debt is being recovered from the power consumers in shape electricity surcharge .
On December 2017 the circular debt was Rs514 billion and previous government had borrowed Rs180 billion to finance it which is now being recovered from the electricity consumers in their power tariff , said an official of the Finance Ministry while briefing the Senate Special Committee on Circular Debt .
The Senate Special Committee on Circular Debt that met here on Tuesday with Senator Shibli Faraz in the chair , noted that the government has neither encouraged alternate energy sources nor supported the private sector to initiate such projects . Senator Shibli Faraz said that the government had deliberately discouraged this sector , as to provide room for the use of costly energy .
While clarifying the government position , Joint Secretary of Power Division Zargham Eshaq said that there is no ban on power generation from alternative sources and anybody can do business in this sector .
Alternative Energy Development Board ( AEDB ) Chief Executive Officer ( CEO ) Amjad Awan said that around 1036 MWs electricity based on alternative energy sources is being supplied to the national grid . Solar PV power projects are generating 430MWs and added that the Quaid-e-Azam Solar Power Plant has not been failed , it is also generating electricity .
He further said that for 16 bagasse-based power plants , tariff and generation licences have been obtained which have the capacity of 132.4MWs .
Awan said that regarding power generation from alternate sources , the masses have not been sensitized nor awareness campaign had been launched by the government .
Shibli Faraz said that to control power shortfall and circular debt , it is necessary to convert tube wells to solar system and also do effective monitoring of water table . Briefing the committee , Quetta Electric Supply Company ( Qesco ) CEO said that 74.14 percent electricity is being consumed by the agriculture consumers in Qesco .
He further said that water table in Qesco jurisdiction has dropped from 300 feet to 850 feet , due to which the agriculture tube wells owners have increased the capacity of their water pumps . There are 327000 agriculture tube wells under Qesco which is also one of the reasons of lowering the water table .
He said that Balochistan government is not paying the Qesco dues . The provincial government has paid only Rs3.4 million out of Rs12.5 million arrears . He further said that the ceiling of agriculture tube well bills is Rs75,000 , of which the owner pay Rs10,000 while the remaining amount is being paid by the federal and provincial government with the ratio of 60 percent and 40 percent respectively . The subsidy also adds up to circular debt , he added .
Earlier the farmers were paying 4000 rupees and after its increase to 10,000 , mostly farmers are not paying bills . He further said that the four grid stations have been upgraded .
He further said that electricity demand of Balochistan is 1800 MWs while it is being supplied only 1000MWs . For domestic and industrial consumption 230MWs is used , while remaining is being consumed by tube wells .
On the issue of Balochistan tube well , Secretary Zargham said that `` We have sent PC-I to the Planning Commission for converting 10,000 agriculture tube wells in Balochistan from grid electricity to solar system , '' he added .
In 2017-18 the government has paid around Rs118 billion as power subsidy . For the ongoing fiscal it would Rs150 billion was allocated for the subsidy . This subsidy is being provided to agriculture tube wells and to those domestic consumers who consume less than 300 units . For agriculture tube wells in Balochistan , nine billion rupees of subsidy would be provided .
Regarding prolong unscheduled load shedding in Shabqadar , Senator Bahramand Khan Tangi said that still there is 22 hours power outage in his constituency despite 90 percent people are paying their bills . Shabqadar grid station is lying closed , he added .
The meeting was attended by Senator Bahramand Khan Tangi , Senator Dr Sikandar Ali Mandhro and senior officers of the Ministry of Finance , Power Division , Nepra , Qesco , Kapco etc .

The threatening language resorted to by PML ( N ) Senator Nihal Hashmi , blinded by his quest to score points to prove his loyalty to PM is unacceptable , unparliamentary and against all democratic norms and practices .
Senator Hashmi must offer a public apology and resign because he has proven by his own deeds to be unworthy of holding any elected public office .
In a country which calls itself Islamic Republic of Pakistan and where no law can be made which conflicts with Quran and Hadiths , nobody including PM or his family and all paid civil , uniformed or elected public servants are above law , nor do they enjoy immunity for criminal offences and financial improprieties committed by them , this is unacceptable .
There are numerous Hadiths making it abundantly clear that in an Islamic State , those holding public offices can not have any conflicts of interest , nor can they be seen abusing their powers and must be accountable for all financial transactions .
They must be judged on a much higher moral and ethical standard than that applicable to common citizens , because their decisions impact lives and destiny of millions .
Caliph Hazrat Abu Bakr , Hazrat Umar etc had to give up all their personal and immediate family trade while holding public office , although doing business was individual right of every other citizen .
Theodore Roosevelt stated that “ no man is above the law and no man is below it , nor do we ask any man 's permission when we ask him to obey it ” .
The assets of PM Nawaz Sharif , his spouse and children are open to public scrutiny and as per law all assets held in their name are required to be declared to Election Commission and FBR .
No manmade system of governance can survive , nor can any sovereign state exist without levying uniform taxation on income generated by all citizens .
The capacity of any state to secure itself from foreign aggression , provide good governance , and cater to welfare of its citizens hinges on tax collection .
Tax evasion is the most heinous of all crimes committed against the state and those guilty have no right to hold any public office and must be given exemplary punishment to serve as deterrence for others .

High ranking PAF officers along with civil and military officials also witnessed this historic event.—APP
The operator of an Enderby kennel has pleaded guilty to an animal cruelty charge .
The operator of an Enderby kennel has pleaded guilty to an animal cruelty charge .
Shalah Dawn Nelson , born in 1978 , pleaded guilty under the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act in Salmon Arm Provincial Court Monday to one count of causing an animal to continue to be in distress in connection with an incident involving a neighbour 's dog at her Enderby property in December 2016 .
Two Criminal Code of Canada charges of killing or injuring an animal and causing unnecessary pain/suffering to an animal against Nelson were stayed by Crown counsel .
“ Based on the information received from the defence , it was determined prosecution was not required to serve the best interest of the public , ” said Crown lawyer Alex Janse on why the Criminal Code charges were stayed .
Janse said in December 2016 , Nelson 's neighbour 's dog came onto Nelson 's property and , to prevent the dog from mating with her dog or her client 's dogs , Nelson tied an elastic hairband around the visiting dog 's testicles .
The dog went back to its home where the owner found the hairband still tied to the dog . The animal was taken to a vet and required surgery . Police were called to investigate , and when they questioned Nelson , she admitted to tying the hairband around the dog 's testicles .
Judge Dennis Morgan fined Nelson $ 1,000 and put her on 12-months probation , which includes not having any contact with the victim dog 's owner . She was also ordered to pay the owner $ 850 restitution .

Watford
Tottenham Hotspur recorded an impressive 4-1 win at Watford on Sunday that sent them above Manchester City on goal difference and into the top four of the Premier League .
An injury-weakened Watford side put up little resistance as two goals by Harry Kane and another from Dele Alli gave Spurs a 3-0 half-time lead .
Alli scored again early in the second half before manager Mauricio Pochettino took off his scorers ahead of the match against leaders Chelsea at White Hart Lane on Wednesday .
“ In three days we have a very important game so if we can rest people and have the opportunity to play different players , it is very important to be fresh and competitive , ” Pochettino told Sky Sports .
“ I 'm very happy because it was a difficult game and the team responded . ”
Chelsea are 10 points ahead of Pochettino 's men , but Spurs will remember all too well that it was at Stamford Bridge that their title hopes were finally ended last season.—AFP
A Ladson company said on its Facebook page it intends to terminate a Ridgeville man photographed at a Virginia white nationalists rally standing beside a murder suspect .
Nigel Krofta has been employed with Limehouse and Sons since May of 2016 , the company said .
Over the weekend , the New York Times posted a photo showing Krofta standing next to James Alex Fields , Jr. , who is charged with driving his car into a crowd of protesters , killing a woman and injuring 19 others hours after the photograph was taken .
The Ladson business posted on its Facebook page Monday that he was `` no longer an employee of Limehouse & Sons , '' adding they `` do not condone the actions of the people involved in this horrific display that has taken place in Charlottesville . ''
`` We also do not knowingly hire criminals but when it comes to our attention that we have someone within our organization that fits this description we deal with it in a timely manner and we turn it over to the proper authorities , people like this have no place in our society , '' the post states .
Owners of the company said they had no idea Koftra was a `` self-proclaimed white nationalist '' and said Monday afternoon they had been trying to contact Koftra all day to fire him , but said he would not return their phone calls .
Krofta says he lost his phone during the protests in Charlottesville .

CLEMSON , S.C. ( WFXB ) – Following Yale 's decision to re-name its Calhoun College for a less controversial figure , students at Clemson University have re-sparked the debate to rename Tillman Hall .
The iconic building is named after Benjamin Tillman , founding trustee of the university , former governor of South Carolina , US Senator…and also , an alleged racist .
Students , alumni and faculty pressured the university to re-name the building in 2015 . The university 's Board of Trustees chose not to do so – citing that Clemson 's historical figures must be preserved .

The UFC will try to help the city of Las Vegas turn the page on last weekend 's horrific tragedy -- and resume some sense of normalcy -- with a planned event on Saturday inside T-Mobile Arena .
An interim lightweight champion will be crowned in either Tony Ferguson or Kevin Lee
And in the co-main event , flyweight champion Demetrious Johnson attempts to break former middleweight titleholder Anderson Silva 's prestigious mark of 10 consecutive title defenses .
Here 's everything you need to know about UFC 216 .
Tony Ferguson ( 22-3 ) vs. Kevin Lee ( 16-2 )
Interim Lightweight Championship
Odds : Ferguson -220 ; Lee +180
Times have changed in the UFC in 2017 , and Saturday 's main event is a perfect example of that .
For the first time in lightweight history , an interim UFC champion will be crowned . The undisputed titleholder , Conor McGregor , is n't injured or expected to miss significant time -- which is , historically speaking , the most common reason interim titles are created .
Editor 's Picks UFC 216 Cheat Sheet : Johnson vs. Borg Demetrious Johnson faces Ray Borg for the UFC flyweight championship in the co-main event of UFC 216 on Saturday . Who has the advantage ? Brett Okamoto breaks it down .
What it 's like to face Demetrious Johnson , the current UFC flyweight champion , aims to set the all-time record for most title defenses at UFC 216 . Eight of his past opponents spoke with ESPN about the challenge of facing `` Mighty Mouse '' and where he ranks in MMA history .
UFC 216 : Several streaks on the line on Saturday Tony Ferguson , Kevin Lee and Demetrious Johnson look to extend their active win streaks in Saturday 's UFC 216 2 Related
The UFC has n't promoted this weekend as a showdown to find out who faces McGregor next . UFC president Dana White has not beaten that drum . At all .
From a marketing standpoint , it would certainly make sense to do so -- as McGregor is the sport 's biggest star -- but the truth is the UFC ca n't make that guarantee .
As of today , it seems just as ( if not more ) likely McGregor will fight Nate Diaz a third time , than face the owner of an interim title .
In a sport where UFC titles have long stood for such high prestige and financial gain , this takes some getting used to . For the actual fighters involved , it 's a potential distraction they 've each handled in their own way .
`` The UFC knows where I stand as far as the Nate and Conor thing , '' said Ferguson , who has won nine in a row . `` I do n't have to talk about it much , honestly . We have rankings for a reason . If that happens , all the s -- - they stand for goes out the f -- -- -- window . ''
Lee , who is eight years younger than Ferguson , said `` from a sporting standpoint , we all know the truth . Conor has only one fight in this division . In no way do I consider him the champion .
`` This fight , hands down , is for the real lightweight championship . You can call it whatever you want but we all know it and Conor knows it , too . As far as I 'm concerned , after I win this belt , he needs to prove to me why he 's a worthy challenger . ''
For the record , in a recent public appearance in Europe , McGregor did say defending the title `` means something '' to him , and he did not rule out facing Saturday 's winner .
Even so , it 's still surreal to see the UFC crown an interim champion under such circumstances . Ferguson ( 22-3 ) , especially , would seem to warrant more promotion at this point in his career . He has n't lost in more than five years and , similar to what made McGregor famous , has welcomed late opponent changes in key spots .
Just seven months ago , he was willing to take a different opponent on 24 hours ' notice in an interim title fight , when his original opponent was hospitalized during a weight cut . Whereas McGregor 's willingness to do the same thing in 2015 earned him wide praise , Ferguson 's has gone relatively forgotten .
When asked if that eats at him , Ferguson says , `` Absolutely not . '' He says he 's not interested in fame and actually avoids it . Part of the reason he trained in the seclusion of Big Bear for this fight was to be away from prying camera crews .
But what might eat at him is if Ferguson is denied future opportunities -- even with an interim belt around his waist . An interim belt used to , if nothing else , guarantee a unification fight with the division 's best . And that 's what Ferguson cares about most .
`` You 've got an amazing , marketable fighter , but if you never give him a chance because you do n't think he 's important , that 's fine , '' Ferguson said . `` I could give two f -- -- about that . But do n't rob a man of his ability to compete . If there 's an interim belt out there , the champion needs to unify that mother -- -- -- . If not , he needs to vacate . ''
Fight Breakdown
Kevin Lee and Tony Ferguson are a combined 19-1 over their last 20 fights . Brandon Magnus/Zuffa LLC/Getty Images
Nine consecutive times now , Ferguson has walked out of the Octagon with his hand raised . That 's what matters , but it 's worth saying he has n't been walking out unscathed .
Rafael dos Anjos landed 121 strikes over five rounds against Ferguson last year . Lando Vannata rocked him with a head kick that nearly knocked him out . Edson Barboza blooded him up , inside two rounds .
Again , Ferguson went on to win all of those , but it illustrates something about him : He takes risks . He invites a fight , and usually wears the results of one .
There are good reasons for him to do so , by the way . Chin . Heart . Cardio . The ability to mentally break an opponent . Those are great qualities to have in a relentlessly-paced fight , and Ferguson has all of them .
Is Lee the lightweight to make him pay for his approach ? On the feet , perhaps not . Lee 's striking is ever-improving , but the nuts and bolts of his game remain wrestling . Is he capable of knocking out a super-aggressive Ferguson ? Sure . But the more likely route for Lee is to take him Ferguson down .
And on the ground , Lee is a real problem . He 's basically finished his last four opponents in the exact same way . Slamming them to the mat , taking their back and choking them out . One of the four was actually a TKO ( the only knockout of Lee 's career ) , but it was a TKO on the floor . He took Jake Matthews ' back , flattened him and rained down strikes .
Lee is a gifted grappler , but he 's still figuring out how to seamlessly work from striking to takedowns . It 's not perfect yet . According to Fightmetric , his takedown success rate is a middling 41 percent . And although Ferguson may be defensively reckless at times , he 's not easy to corral . He 's active in scrambles and actually quite dangerous . He set up a choke on Vannata that began with a standing guillotine . He hit a choke on Barboza while they were in the middle of a scramble .
For Lee to win , there 's a good chance he 'll need to earn Ferguson 's respect on the feet first . As dominant as his grappling can be , he 'll need to set it up with strikes against a well-rounded Ferguson -- and he 'll also need an answer for the constant pressure . If he 's slamming into too many failed takedown attempts early on , there 's just no way his cardio will hold up .
Prediction : Ferguson via submission , fourth round .
MOSUL/HILLA - Islamic State attacked an Iraqi police checkpoint near the southern city of Najaf on Sunday , killing seven policemen as government forces in the north made more gains against the militants in Mosul , their last major stronghold in the country .
The Najaf attack , which involved gunmen and a suicide car bomb , followed blasts a day earlier in Baghdad that left 29 people dead , a reminder of Islamic State 's continued ability to operate away from territory under its control .
The recapture of Mosul would probably spell the end for the group 's self-styled caliphate in the areas it seized in 2014 , but the militants would still be capable of fighting a guerrilla-style insurgency in Iraq , and plotting or inspiring attacks on the West .
Since the U.S.-backed offensive began on Oct. 17 , elite forces have retaken a quarter of Mosul in the biggest ground operation in Iraq since the 2003 U.S.-led invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein . Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi has said the group would be driven out of the country by April .
The second phase of the campaign launched on Thursday following weeks of deadlock has pushed Islamic State out of several more areas despite fierce resistance . The fourth day of the renewed push saw incremental advances on the eastern and southeastern fronts .
A military statement said the counter-terrorism forces had retaken part of Karama district . A federal police officer said Iraqi forces had taken near total control of Intisar and Siha neighbourhoods , and were clearing Salam .
`` For the fourth day in a row , federal police units supported by the army are on the offensive , '' he told Reuters at a forward base in Intisar .
An artillery strike on Sunday by the U.S.-led coalition supporting the Iraqi forces struck a mortar position next to two empty school buildings in eastern Mosul . A U.S. military statement said no civilians were in the area and minimal damage was reported to the buildings , which like hospitals and mosques , are protected under international law .
`` While the Coalition takes extraordinary effort to protect civilians and strike appropriate military targets , we will continue to strike ISIL wherever and whenever our partner 's lives are in danger in accordance with the Law of Armed Conflict , '' it said , using an acronym for Islamic State .
FLEEING CIVILIANS
The attack near Najaf , 500 km ( 310 mile ) south of Mosul , happened when two vehicles travelling through the desert were stopped at a police checkpoint around al-Qadisiya town , local police sources said .
The driver detonated an explosive load and the second vehicle fled . Police pursued it and killed the two militants inside . In a statement distributed online by supporters , Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attack , which also wounded 17 people including civilians . It said four gunmen had opened fire before detonating explosive vests and then a fifth assailant launched a suicide car bomb . It was not immediately possible to reconcile those accounts . Although the militants are vastly outnumbered in Mosul , they have embedded themselves among residents , hindering Iraqi forces who are trying to avoid civilian casualties . Despite food and water shortages , most civilians have stayed in their homes rather than fleeing as had been expected .
Thousands more people have fled their homes since the military 's new push began , many under the cover of darkness to avoid detection by Islamic State .
Families leaving Mithaq district on Sunday had to climb over earthen berms the military has built across roads to block car bombs .
One resident reached by phone in eastern Mosul said he had never seen such heavy bombardment . Several civilians were wounded when a mortar fell in his street , but they could not be ferried to the hospital on the western side of the city because air strikes have taken all the bridges out of service .
`` One of them is my friend . His stomach is bleeding badly . We found a doctor in the neighbourhood to treat him but I fear he will die if he stays like this for long , '' he said . A resident of Karama district said Islamic State had begun forcing residents out of some areas , burning the cars of residents who refused to move . `` They want to clear out the neighbourhood before the Iraqi forces enter , '' he said .

PanARMENIAN.Net - Government forces and their allies advanced Monday , April 17 in the central province of Hama under the cover of intense airstrikes , approaching the outskirts of a rebel-held town a day after capturing a strategic town from opposition fighters and militants , Syria 's state media and opposition activists said , according to The Associated Press .
The push toward the town of Tibet al-Imam came a day after troops and pro-government militiamen captured the town of Soran , a month after Soran was lost in a rebel offensive . The government appears to be aiming to secure areas north of the city of Hama , the country 's fourth largest .
Insurgents , including members of al-Qaida-linked Levant Liberation Committee , launched a wide offensive on parts of Hama province last month capturing several villages and towns . The government launched a wide counteroffensive under the cover of Russian and Syrian airstrikes regaining control of the whole area lost and pushing ahead toward other villages .
The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said Syrian air force jets had conducted nearly 25 airstrikes on Tibet al-Imam and nearby villages since midnight .
Syrian state news agency SANA quoted an unnamed military official as saying that troops are now at the eastern entrance of Tibet al-Imam after capturing nearby hills under the cover of intense bombardment .
Earlier on Monday , the Observatory and Syrian-based opposition activist Taher al-Omar said that members of the Levant Liberation Committee captured several army checkpoints near the central town of Salamiyeh . The Observatory and state media said government forces regained control of the checkpoints hours later .
Take Note : 6 Expenses for New Businesses
Businesses have to spend money before their doors even open . Startup expenses can be defined as those expenses that are incurred even before the business is up and running . Many people have a tendency to underestimate what those startup costs will be and this means that when their business starts , it is in an unplanned and haphazard way . While it is possible for it to work out even when started this way , it is more difficult .
Let 's take a peek at what some of these costs might be . You might even want to take a peek at a sort of guide for startups that tells you how to do things without a lot of money .
1 . Marketing
All businesses need marketing if they want to be a success . Without marketing , how would your target demographic know that your business even existed ? There are many ways to market – some traditional , and some are more newfangled . One of those newfangled ways to market is with SEO digital marketing . Why would you invest in this type of marketing , though ? One reason is because it gives you a high ROI or return on investment . Another reason is simply because it works . SEO is n't going anywhere anytime soon either . It is here to stay , so you might as well get used to it . Also , your competition uses it . Are you going to let them get ahead of you because they use SEO and you do n't ?
Marketing is one of the things that you will need to take into account when you are estimating your startup costs .
2 . Planning
Creating a business plan is absolutely essential to starting a new business . This plan should be akin to a detailed map of what you are trying to create . Business plans force you to consider all of the various costs of starting your business . Underestimating these expenses can lead you to falsely increase your expected net profit and this is a situation that is n't good for any owner of a small business .
Each business is different and as such , can require different types of costs to get started . Brick and mortar businesses will have different costs than online businesses just as bookstores will have different startup costs than coffee shops .
With that being said , there are a few typical costs that can be common to all types of businesses . They include but are not limited to things like :
Expenses for research .
Permit , license , and insurance fees .
Supplies and equipment .
Promotion and advertising .
Borrowing costs .
Expenses for employees .
Technological expenses .
Let 's take a look at a couple of these .
3 . Expenses for Research
Carefully researching the industry and the consumer makeup has to be done before you start a business . Sometimes , business owners make the choice to hire a market research firm to assist them in this process of assessment . For those business owners who decide to take this route , they need to figure market research expenses and fees into their business plan .
4 . Supplies and Equipment
Each type of business will require some type of basic supplies and equipment . Before you add the cost of this equipment to your list of costs for the startup , you need to decide if you will lease or buy this equipment . Your state of finances will necessarily play a huge part in this decision . You might have enough in the budget to outright buy the equipment , but then again , you might come into unexpected and unavoidable expenses , and this might make leasing an option that is more attractive .
Whatever the case , it is critical to remember that whatever your cash position is , leasing might not be the best option either , depending on what type of equipment you need and what the lease terms are .
5 . Expenses for Employees
Businesses that plan to hire employees have to make specific plans for salaries , wages , and benefits – if benefits will be offered . Failing to adequately compensate your employees can end up with morale being low , eventual mutiny , and publicity that is n't good . All of this can be bad for a business .
6 . Technological Expenses
This can include the cost of having a website designed and hosted , registering a domain name , software and information systems , and more . This includes software for payroll and accounting . Sometimes , small business owners will outsource these things so that they can keep their expenses to a minimum .
According to a report from Autocar , Nissan has given a thumbs up for a 370Z successor , reportedly called the 400Z . Further , the next Z car , internally referred to as Z35 , will be twinned with the next Infiniti Q60 , per unnamed senior Nissan officials . The cars would , therefore , share a rear-wheel-drive platform , an engine lineup , and an electrical system .
Motor Authority reached out to Infiniti for comment on the next Q60 in an effort to shed light on the rumored 400Z . Kyle Bazemore , Infiniti 's U.S. director of communications , told us the brand has no comment on future products . He added , `` The Q60 was all-new last model year , so it 's quite early to be discussing its replacement . ''
2018 Infiniti Q60 Enlarge Photo
Should the information prove true , the next Nissan Z will be larger in all dimensions to match its Q60 twin , though the wheelbase could also be shortened for the Z . Under the hood would be a 3.0-liter twin-turbocharged V-6 engine . The current Q50 and Q60 employ the engine , which makes 400 horsepower and 350 pound-feet of torque .
The report goes on to allege an even hotter 400Z Nismo is in the works with a tweaked 3.0-liter twin-turbo V-6 engine good for 475 hp and 451 lb-ft of torque . Supposedly , it will also boast an all-wheel-drive system and arrive in 2021 after the standard 400Z hits the market for 2020 .
Autocar claims the 400Z will arrive in concept form at the 2018 Tokyo motor show . However , there is no Tokyo motor show for 2018 .
It 's possible such a car shows up at the 2018 Tokyo auto salon , though a new Z car seems like a pretty high-profile debut for the auto salon , which focuses more on performance and aftermarket vehicles . Should it show up , the report claims the production version will arrive at the 2019 Los Angeles auto show to celebrate the Z car 's 50th birthday .
2018 Nissan 370Z Enlarge Photo
After numerous suggestions from Nissan pointing to the Z car 's death march , a source told Motor Authority last January that Nissan will update the 370Z to meet regulatory guidelines for safety . Our source added there 's `` strong interest within the company for the Z to live on . ''
In response to rumors surrounding a 370Z successor , Nissan director of U.S. communications , Dan Bedore , told Motor Authority , `` We have not announced any plans beyond the 2018 model year 370Z , and as a policy do not comment on speculation regarding future product plans and partnerships . ''
WILLIAMSBURG , Va. — Tramaine Isabell scored 23 points , grabbed eight rebounds and dished out eight assists to help Drexel slip past William & Mary for a 91-79 win Saturday .
Drexel ( 11-14 , 5-7 Colonial Athletic Association ) trailed most of the game but stayed close , overtaking William & Mary for good on Alihan Demir 's layup with 3:44 remaining to go up 72-71 . The Dragons then scored 11 of the next 13 points and hung on .
Kurk Lee added 22 points for Drexel , which got 20 assists on its 32 baskets and finished with 62 per cent shooting , including 11 for 22 from long range . Sammy Mojica and Lee finished with 12 points apiece and Austin Williams had 10 as the Dragons extended their win streak to four .
William & Mary ( 15-8 , 8-4 ) entered the game tied for first with Charleston atop the conference standings . David Cohn led the Tribe with 26 points , including 10 for 10 shooting at the free throw line , and nine assists . Justin Pierce added 15 points , Matt Milon had 12 and Nathan Knight 11 .
Head coach , Simon Hewitt , said : “ The popularity of women 's football is growing dramatically , not only in the UAE but globally and we want as many young girls to get involved in the games as possible . We already have female-only sessions in our programme but we want to ensure we are giving as many opportunities as possible to girls in the UAE to get involved .
SUKKUR : Opposition leader , Syed Khursheed Shah spoke out against Nawaz Shareef for staging a rally that was “ against state institutions ” on Monday .
Shah recalled Benazir Bhutto and Asif Ali Zardari 's removal from office addressing an event earlier today .
“ Nawaz and Shehbaz played a big role in disqualifying Shaheed Benazir Bhutto and Asif Zardari , do they not remember that time ? ” he said .
“ When we were trying to [ abolish ] Articles 62 , 63 Nawaz Sharif had ‘ conspiracy ' on his mind , ” Shah alleged , adding , “ Nawaz was thinking of applying those articles against Zardari in the memo scandal . ”
Shah called out wastefulness at PMNL-N 's ‘ show of force ' rally , estimating a cost of “ atleast Rs . 40-50 crore ” .
“ Mian sahib , be silent now . Come back when you are restored , ” the opposition leader said .
Former Prime Minister Nawaz Shareef took out a four-day rally , setting out from Islamabad and making several stops along GT Road before reaching Lahore on Sunday .

When it comes to picking the best Legend of Zelda game out there , the top contenders typically are Ocarina of Time and A Link to the Past. With the release of Breath of the Wild on the Wii U and Nintendo Switch there is now a new challenger to stake its claim as best Zelda ever .
Its also the freshest Zelda game to date , taking cues from the one that started it all on the NES  The Legend of Zelda. Link wakes up from a 100-year slumber in the Shrine of Resurrection to the voice of Princess Zelda , who has sealed Calamity Ganon inside Hyrule Castle and asks for Links help in defeating him . After a tutorial-like sequence in the Great Plateau that introduces you to the all-important Sheikah Slate tool , shrines , and skills Link will use on his journey , you can leap off the plateau and safely paraglide down onto the rest of the world and go wherever you please . Of course , there are the main quest lines involving destroying Ganon , but the real beauty of this game is exploring the world to your hearts content .
Its a massive and lively one complete with villages , enemy camps , hot and cold environments , dangerous lightning storms and many other surprises . Even before you make the big leap , you figure out pretty quickly this is a Zelda game like never before . Theres a stamina wheel that limits your sprint , climbing and paragliding distance . Cooking dishes and elixirs are important to heal up quickly and stave off the harsh environmental elements that slowly drain Links health , so there are dozens of items across the land that can be mixed together . Unique armor sets can be collected as well to increase his resistance to hot and cold settings . Weapons and shields of varying strengths break over time , which forces you to experiment with different types in battle . Each section of the map can be completely revealed by climbing and activating a very tall tower , which is tedious at first but more manageable later on if you choose to have your stamina wheel upgraded . All of these popular elements from other games are blended together to make for a very memorable Zelda adventure .
This is also the most difficult Zelda game in years . Link starts out wearing raggedy clothes with barely any defense , and is in desperate need of a weapon . I found a tree branch and went to work immediately on some bokoblins , eventually using their clubs and shields and progressing from there . Because of inventory limits on bows , swords and shields , it gets frustrating in the beginning not being able to carry everything you see . Youre able to increase those limits by collecting Korok seeds from little forest creatures that are hidden throughout the land . With 900 total , you dont have to search hard to find them . One-hit kills are a common occurrence , too , even when the right armor is equipped , especially from the giant mechanical guardians that roam the land . Dying so much led me to improve my strategies and take advantage of the dodge and parry system .

Shrines play a big role in Breath of the Wild and make up for the games lack of traditional dungeons . The introductory ones on the Great Plateau unlock abilities like throwing bombs , stopping time , creating ice pillars and using magnetism to drag metal objects around . Most of the individually named shrines involve solving puzzles of varying difficulties using those abilities , while some feature a guardian-type enemy to defeat instead . Completing them rewards you with orbs , which can be cashed in four at a time at special statues to obtain either a Heart Container or Stamina Vessel to extend Links life or stamina capacity , respectively . More than 100 are in the game , and while I only found just under half before completing the main quests , those puzzle scenarios were all original . They also act as fast travel points , which makes reaching specific destinations a breeze .
After a couple dozen hours traveling the world on foot and horseback without a care in the world , it was time to get down to business and take care of Links familiar foe . For as epic as Breath of the Wild is , the narrative is pretty basic . A technology-advanced civilization created guardians and four divine beasts to defeat Ganon , and preparations began again for his return . However , he got the best of Hyrule Castle and took control of the guardians and beasts to wreak havoc across the land . While you dont have to free the beasts from Ganons control in order to defeat him , its best to do so in order to learn backstory . The beasts act as the games main dungeons , although they are nowhere near as complex as past games . They can be completed in a short amount of time through puzzle solving , but all the boss fights are a treat to play .
Playing in portable mode on the Switch is the best way to go . I noticed frame rate issues and lagging during my times in docked mode for television play , but everything was smooth sailing when playing it like a handheld . The battery life takes a hit , though , barely getting three hours on normal settings , so settle near an outlet for longer sessions if you opt this route .
In my mind , Breath of the Wild is now the best Zelda ever , although it feels a little unfair knocking Ocarina of Time  my previous titleholder  from the pedestal . Its such a radical departure from most games in the series that it probably shouldnt even be compared to the other Zelda classics . Breath of the Wild is in a league of its own .
4 stars out of 4
VENTURA , Calif. ( Reuters ) - Firefighters across Southern California made progress on Saturday battling a slew of scattered wildfires that have killed at least one person , destroyed hundreds of buildings and forced more than 200,000 people from their homes this week .
As the dry Santa Ana winds that have fueled the blazes abated slightly , officials lifted evacuation orders for parts of Ventura and Santa Barbara counties , and crews started getting the upper hand in containing some major fires .
But with the National Weather Service expecting a pickup in top wind velocity to 55 miles per hour ( 89 km per hour ) on Sunday from 40 miles per hour ( 64 km per hour ) , the 8,700 firefighters battling six fast-moving blazes were under pressure to work quickly .
“ We 're far from being out of the woods on any of them , ” Ken Pimlott , director of the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection ( CAL FIRE ) , told a news briefing in Ventura .
At an evacuation shelter at the Ventura County Fairgrounds on Saturday , fluorescent lights shone above hundreds of cots set up in rows . Outside , dust and soot made it hard to breathe .
Surah Yasharal and Yaaqub Yoshua were at the shelter with their two toddlers , stuck there since arriving by Greyhound bus from Florida on Friday . They had planned to move into a guest house owned by Yoshua 's employer , but by Saturday they still had not learned whether it had survived .
“ If it 's not there when we get there , we 'll go back to the drawing board , ” said Yoshua , 26 . “ We 'll improvise . ”
Marie Snyder was at the beach on Monday evening when the fire started . She could not return to her home in the community of Oak View , so she stayed with friends for a few days , coming to the shelter on Friday .
“ We were down at the beach and all of a sudden it got really windy and then it got really warm , ” she said . “ And then I saw the moon was red . ”
This week 's fires have destroyed nearly 800 buildings , mostly in Ventura County where the Thomas Fire , the largest blaze , erupted on Monday .

Officials said that by Saturday the Thomas Fire had charred 148,000 acres ( 59,893 hectares ) , an area about the size of Chicago . As evening approached , the blaze was the most active north of the small city of Ojai , north of Ventura , known for its classical music festival and its spas . Ojai itself was not threatened , officials said .
California Governor Jerry Brown told reporters that climate change had helped make intense fires such as these the state 's “ new normal . ”
The fires threatened Californians from Santa Barbara County down the Pacific Coast to Mexico . They have claimed at least one human casualty : Virginia Pesola , 70 , died in a Wednesday car accident along an evacuation route from the Thomas Fire .

“ The cause of death is blunt force injuries with terminal smoke inhalation and thermal injuries , ” Ventura County Medical Examiner Christopher Young said in a statement on Friday .
Brown issued emergency proclamations this week for Santa Barbara , San Diego , Los Angeles and Ventura counties . President Donald Trump issued a federal proclamation that enables agencies to coordinate relief efforts .
The fires have threatened property worth billions of dollars , just weeks after October wildfires in Northern California resulted in insured losses of more than $ 9 billion . Those fires , concentrated in wine country , killed 43 people .
At their peak , this week 's fires drove about 212,000 Californians from their homes . The lifting of several evacuation orders reduced the number of people displaced from their homes to 87,000 on Saturday .
Visibility improved in Ventura early on Saturday , with blue skies returning as strong winds blew smoke out to sea .
Throughout the area , officials reported gains in their battle to contain the fires . The Thomas Fire was 15 percent contained and the Skirball Fire in Los Angeles was 75 percent contained , while the Creek and Rye Fires in Los Angeles County were 80 percent and 65 percent contained , officials said .
North of San Diego , the 4,100-acre ( 1,660-hectare ) Lilac Fire was 20 percent contained by Saturday , officials said . Fallbrook , known for its avocado orchards , burned , and homes were destroyed in its Rancho Monserate Country Club retirement community .

The violence in Charlottesville , Virginia , is shocking , sad and simply hard to understand .
A 32-year-old woman is dead and more than 30 injured at a Civil War monument removal protest by Neo-Nazis , the KKK and other white supremacist hate groups .
A man drove his car into counter-protestors . Two state police pilots monitoring the rally were killed in a helicopter crash .
The U.S. attorney general has opened a civil rights investigation .
The suspect is a known member of a hate group . If he drove that car into the crowd with the intent to hurt and to kill , and police say the evidence indicates he did , that 's no different than the recent terrorist truck attacks in Europe .
There 's no place for that kind of hate in our country , or in our hearts .
Our thoughts and prayers are with the families of the dead , the victims and with the people and the city of Charlottesville .

LAHORE - Former Pakistan team captain Wasim Akram termed Sarfraz Ahmas as a fighter saying he needs time to adjust .
Speaking at a ceremony to launch a private company 's product , Wasim said : “ Sarfraz Ahmed is a fighter and he will fight back in the second Test . As everyone saw , the team early matches of the Champions Trophy , but under Sarfraz captaincy , the team bounced back and outclassed arch-rivals India in the final to clinch the mega trophy . This quality of Sarfraz shows that he is a good fighter and he is bound to excel . ”
Coming down hard on the critics for criticizing the Champions Trophy heroes just after one match , he said : “ We should give the team and players some time to settle down and perform well . As compared to other nations , our team played very less Test cricket as they just got two Tests in six months , while on the other hand , Sri Lanka recently played a full-fledged Test series against India , and that 's why they are in a better shape than us . ”
The sultan of swing said that Pakistan team is well balanced and they will bounce back . “ We have very balanced team as it is a combination of young and experienced players and I am hopeful that it will bounce back and succeed in winning the second Test against Sri Lanka . ”
About Misbah-ul-Haq and Younus Khan , the former captain said : “ Yes , both Misbah and Younus were missed during the first Test . They were backbone of the team and during their era , the middle order was very strong . But the team has some good players who are capable of filling the void created by these two batsmen. ” He said there is no grouping in the team . “ Only collective efforts are needed to help Pakistan win the second Test . ”
To another query about moving from Islamabad United to Multan Sultans , Wasim said : “ I love adventures and this is also part of another adventure of my life . I had great time with United players and staff but now I am with Multan Sultans and want to make it one of the best teams of Pakistan Super League . ”

Texas stays alive after pinch runner Michael Ramos ignores the third-base coach 's hold sign and leaps over the catcher to win the game in the eighth inning . ( 0:52 )
The PONY League World Series Tournament is taking place in Washington County , Pennsylvania , this week . The tournament featured an elimination game on Monday between Brownsville , Texas , and the hometown Washington City team .
With the score tied in the bottom of the eighth inning , pinch-runner Michael Ramos was n't going to be denied . Michael disregarded his coach telling him to hold up at third base and continued to run toward home . The Brownsville native avoided the tag from the catcher by leaping over him to score , giving Brownsville a 4-3 victory .
Sometimes , you 've got to take matters into your own hands . This time , it paid off for Ramos .

Internet and technology luminaries , including Web creator Tim Berners-Lee , Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak and `` Father of the internet '' Vint Cerf , have called on the FCC to cancel its planned net neutrality vote this week , arguing that it is based on a `` flawed and factually inaccurate understanding of Internet technology . ''
`` We are the pioneers and technologists who created and now operate the Internet , and some of the innovators and business people who , like many others , depend on it for our livelihood , '' the open letter , sent to key Congressmen and women , begins .
`` We are writing to respectfully urge you to call on FCC chairman Ajit Pai to cancel the December 14 vote on the FCC 's proposed Restoring Internet Freedom Order . ''
The `` flawed and factually inaccurate '' plan has been drawn up despite its flaws being highlighted in some detail back in July , the letter notes . `` These flaws and inaccuracies were documented in detail in a 43-page-long joint comment [ PDF ] signed by over 200 of the most prominent Internet pioneers and engineers , '' the letter states , adding that not only did the FCC fail to `` correct its misunderstandings '' but also `` premised the proposed Order on the very technical flaws '' that were pointed out .
It is notable that the letter is addressed to Congress , rather than the FCC , following several weeks in which FCC chair Ajit Pai and his fellow Republican commissioners have responded to widespread criticism and critiques of their plan with mockery and disparagement rather than considered responses .
A planned online protest this week has also given up on talking to the FCC and has set its sights on lawmakers in the hope that they will put pressure on Pai to abandon his plan .
For your own protection
The technologists ' letter notes that the repeal plan would remove protections `` that prevent Internet access providers from blocking content , websites and applications , slowing or speeding up services or classes of service , and charging online services for access or fast lanes to Internet access providers ' customers . ''
It would `` remove long-standing FCC oversight over Internet access providers without an adequate replacement to protect consumers , free markets and online innovation . ''
The letter also adds to calls for the vote to be delayed until several other issues are dealt with , including : the deeply flawed FCC public comment process ; the failure to hold an open meeting to hear from individuals and experts about the proposal ; and the refusal to respond to FoIA requests for information as well as an investigation by New York 's Attorney General .
`` The FCC 's rushed and technically incorrect proposed Order to abolish net neutrality protections without any replacement is an imminent threat to the Internet we worked so hard to create . It should be stopped , '' the letter concludes .
As well as Berners-Lee , Wozniak and Cerf , the letter has also been signed by a number of less well-known but equally important internet pioneers such as Postel Service Award winners Scott Bradner and Stephen Wolff , and cryptography experts Martin Hellman and Whitfield Diffie .
In total , 21 individuals that together represent a comprehensive cross-section of internet experts have signed onto the letter .
Musicians play on
In addition to this open letter , a second signed by musicians , actors and artists also calls on those in Congress to pressure the FCC not to move forward with the vote , planned for this Thursday , December 14 .
REM 's Michael Stipe , Rage Against the Machine 's Tom Morello , Graham Nash of Crosby , Stills and Nash fame , and concert violinist Joshua Bell are among the 150 signatories that make the less technical but more immediate argument that `` without net neutrality there will be less awesome art . Period . ''
Meanwhile , Ajit Pai is continuing his unusual gaslighting campaign , complaining about the lack of civil discourse and the damaging impact of misinformation sent through social media , all while refusing to engage with experts , and using his social media accounts ( and speeches ) to issue uncivil insults and misinformation .
Increasingly , observers are convinced that Pai and his fellow commissioners simply do n't understand how the internet actually works , and have formed a view of the internet built almost entirely on the cable industry 's perspective . Their failure to listen to voices outside the Big Cable bubble is , however , entirely on them . ®
Michigan head coach John Beilein yells from the sidelines during the second half of an NCAA college basketball game against Minnesota , Saturday in Ann Arbor , Mich. Carlos Osorio  The Associated Press
ANN ARBOR , Mich. > > Muhammad-Ali Abdur-Rahkman made a tiebreaking three-point play with 3.8 seconds left and finished with 17 points as No . 24 Michigan held on to beat Minnesota 76-73 in overtime on Saturday .
The Wolverines ( 19-6 , 8-4 Big Ten ) needed the extra time to win because they struggled to shoot from the field and the line . And they failed to slow down a pair of guards .
The Golden Gophers ( 14-11 , 3-9 ) were in a position to end their longest losing streak of the year because freshman Isaiah Washington had a season-high 26 points and Nate Mason scored 22 points , including a 3-pointer with 5.3 seconds left that tied the game .
Mason was just short on a shot from about 30 feet that would have forced a second overtime .

Michigans Zavier Simpson made a layup and a 3-pointer  after missing his first seven attempts beyond the arc  to give his offensively challenged team a four-point lead with 2:50 left in the extra period .
The Gophers tied the game with 11 seconds left , but couldnt keep Abdur-Rahkman from making what the game-winning play on a hard-charging drive for a layup on which he was fouled by Jamir Harris .
Moe Wagner had 16 points and 10 rebounds , Simpson scored 15 and Charles Matthews had 13 points for the Wolverines , who have won four straight at home . Michigan made just 44 percent of its shots from the field and was 8 of 32 from the 3-point line .
Minnesotas Jordan Murphy fouled out in overtime with 12 points and six rebounds .
BIG PICTURE
Minnesota : The short-handed Gophers , who played just seven players , extended their season-long losing streak to five games . Minnesota was without Reggie Lynch because of an investigation into sexual assault allegations along with Amir Coffey ( right shoulder ) and Gaston Diedhiou ( ankle ) due to injuries .
Michigan : The Wolverines will lose some games they should win if they dont shoot better at the free throw line . They were 12 of 28 at the line , an area that has been a season-long weakness .

SPOILER ALERT : Do not keep reading if you have not seen the Season 8 midseason finale of “ The Walking Dead ”
The father of a key “ Walking Dead ” character vented his frustrations with the show and showrunner Scott Gimple on social media following his son 's onscreen death in this Sunday 's midseason finale .
“ Watching Gimple fire my son 2 weeks before his 18th birthday after telling him they wanted him for the next 3 years was disappointing , ” William Riggs , father of Carl Grimes actor Chandler Riggs , wrote on Facebook . “ I never trusted Gimple or AMC but Chandler did . I know how much it hurt him . But we do absolutely know how lucky we have been to be a part of it all and appreciate all the love from fans all these years ! ”
In the closing moments of the midseason finale , Carl revealed to his father Rick ( Andrew Lincoln ) that he had been bitten by a walker . He did not die at the end of the episode though , meaning he will get one more episode to say goodbye once the show returns in February .
“ That is a bite on his side.… It will play out as bites play out on the show , ” Gimple said Sunday on “ Talking Dead. ” “ It 's very important to Carl 's story and the entire story , what happens in the next episode . I 'm just focused on the fact that Carl right now is alive and he has some business to attend to . That is a one-way ticket . But I 'd like to think that the things we see in the next episode are so important to his life and the other characters ' lives . ”
KABUL : The Islamic State group said its fighters have captured Osama bin Laden 's infamous Tora Bora mountain hideout in eastern Afghanistan but the Taliban on Thursday dismissed the claim , saying they were still in control of the cave complex that once housed the former al-Qaida leader .
Earlier , IS released an audio recording , saying its signature black flag was flying over the hulking mountain range . The message was broadcast on the militants ' Radio Khilafat station in the Pashto language late on Wednesday .
It also said IS has taken over several districts and urged villagers who fled the fighting to return to their homes and stay indoors .
A Taliban spokesman denied IS was in control , claiming instead that the Taliban had pushed IS back from some territory the rival militants had taken in the area .
The Tora Bora mountains hide a warren of caves in which al-Qaeda militants led by bin Laden hid from U.S. coalition forces in 2001 , after the Taliban fled Kabul and before he fled to neighboring Pakistan .
According to testimony from al-Qaeda captives in the U.S. prison at Guantamo Bay , Cuba , bin Laden fled from Tora Bora first to Afghanistan 's northeastern Kunar province , before crossing the border into Pakistan . He was killed in a 2011 raid by U.S. Navy SEALs on his hideout in the Pakistani garrison town of Abbottabad .
Pakistan complained the raid violated its sovereignty while bin Laden 's presence — barely a few miles from the Pakistani equivalent of Washington 's West Point military academy — reinforced allegations by those who accused Pakistan of harboring the Taliban and al-Qaeda militants . Pakistan denies such charges , pointing to senior al-Qaida operatives it has turned over to the United States .
Meanwhile , Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid told The Associated Press in a telephone interview that Taliban fighters pushed back the Islamic State group from areas of Tora Bora that IS had earlier captured .
Mujahid claimed that more than 30 IS fighters were killed in battle . He also added that a U.S. airstrike on Taliban positions on Wednesday that killed 11 of its fighters had benefited the Islamic State group .
The remoteness of the area makes it impossible to independently verify the contradictory claims .
Afghan officials earlier said that fighting between IS and the Taliban , who had controlled Tora Bora , began on Tuesday but could n't confirm its capture .
While the United States estimates there are about 800 IS fighters in Afghanistan , mostly restricted to the eastern Nangarhar province , other estimates say their ranks also include thousands of battle-hardened Uzbek militants .
Last week Russia announced it was reinforcing two of its bases in Central Asia , in Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan , with its newest weapons because of fears of a “ spill-over of terrorist activities from Afghanistan ” by the Afghan IS affiliate .
“ The ( IS ) group 's strategy to establish an Islamic caliphate poses a threat not only to Afghanistan but also to the neighboring countries , ” Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu said .
There 's an alarming degree of disingenuousness , or perhaps merely naiveté , permeating “ Be Natural : The Untold Story of Alice Guy-Blaché. ” To begin with , there 's that title , “ The Untold Story , ” which ignores a number of earlier documentaries not to mention the significant amount of scholarship on pioneering filmmaker Alice Guy-Blaché . Also omitted is any mention of the 2009 Gaumont and Kino DVD box sets that made 66 of her films available . These are what can be called inconvenient truths , for Pamela B . Green , director of “ Be Natural , ” is on a mission to discover why — supposedly — no one has ever heard of Alice Guy-Blaché .
As Green tells it , the reason is pure and simple : Because she was a woman , Guy-Blaché was written out of the history books . That 's not entirely wrong . Alice Guy , as she was then known , was present at the very start of the film industry and played a crucial role in the development of the medium both in France and the U.S. , yet in later years her contributions were downplayed or ignored . There are however two problems with Green 's assessment : First , the early years of film history are riddled with major lacunae , and sloppy mid-20th-century scholarship did substantial damage to a proper understanding of the birth of cinema . This is true for most of the medium 's pioneers , and while Guy-Blaché 's vital work was frequently ignored , so too were the efforts of a great deal of others in the fledgling industry . Second , Green 's own cavalier disregard for current research inaccurately reflects , and does a disservice to , Guy-Blaché 's status today among film historians .
Yet “ Be Natural ” is likely to get a considerable amount of attention because it savvily invokes the # MeToo movement with its tale of the first female voice suppressed by the film industry . Green 's most impressive achievement is n't the film itself but the major Kickstarter and merchandising campaign she organized to fund the documentary , as well as the list of Hollywood heavy hitters she brought in on both sides of the camera . The enterprise would be something to celebrate if the movie itself were n't so flawed , not just in scholarly terms but in her mania for visualizing seemingly every phone call she made in the hunt for Guy-Blaché material . Sadly , all these problems overwhelm Green 's noteworthy success in tracking down previously unknown documents and photos .
Just get a gander at the sheer number of people she interviewed ( over 90 ! ) , as well as the names . Most of us would be intrigued to hear Diablo Cody , or Gale Anne Hurd , or Lake Bell talk about the hurdles women in Hollywood face today , yet asking them if they know about Guy-Blaché is about as informative as person-on-the-street segments by late-night TV hosts — though not nearly as amusing . Yes , Green interviews important scholars and archivists such as Alison McMahan , Dino Everett , and Richard Koszarski , but their voices are drowned out by people with no ties to film history who all express amazement that they 've never heard of Guy-Blaché . One wonders : Have they heard of the Skladanowsky brothers , Robert W. Paul , Albert Capellani , Émile Cohl… ?
The documentary is fine at establishing the early chronology : Alice Guy was a secretary to Léon Gaumont before asking him in 1896 if she could direct a film . Gaumont said yes , and in short order she became not only a prolific director but head of production at the studio . In 1907 she married a fellow Gaumont employee , Herbert Blaché , and the two moved shortly after to the U.S. , where in 1910 she set up her own studio , Solax . World War I created major financial problems for Solax , so by the late teens she was working for other studios and then , two years following their divorce in 1920 , she returned to France , where a changed industry failed to give her opportunities for directing . In later life she stayed with her daughter Simone and died in New Jersey in 1968 .
Green organizes her film like a detective story , tracking down every U.S.-based connection she can find via Ancestry.com and the phone directory . Her tenacity paid off and to her credit she unearthed an impressive amount of material hidden in family albums and storage cartons . She also wisely relies on filmed interviews with Guy-Blaché made in 1957 and 1964 ( mostly available on YouTube ) , though tellingly Green glides over without comment Guy-Blaché 's statement that she never had a problem as a female filmmaker working in America .
Green also barely acknowledges other women working in the U.S. industry around that time , briefly alluding to Lois Weber but no one else , nor does she mention the groundbreaking work of the Women Film Pioneers Project . No one from the Cinémathèque Française or Gaumont are interviewed despite significant work both institutions have done in recent years , nor is it ever stated that approximately 75 % of all silent film is lost — which would have put into perspective Green 's presumptuous implication that Guy-Blaché 's films were allowed to disintegrate because a woman had been behind the camera .
The movie is overloaded with visual gimmicks , and for a film about early cinema , it 's more than maddening that many of the clips are shown at the wrong speed , and occasionally the incorrect aspect ratio . Curiously , the documentary 's cinematographer is not credited .

It 's a debate that you may not know exists , but in the world of social media , it has been a hotly debated topic .
So fierce is the debate over the pronunciation of Primark that some customers have even asked in stores across the UK about the proper way to pronounce Primark .
Others have submitted a written question on the ‘ help ' section of the Primark website .
Much debate has followed the brand over the pronunciation of their name , with customers debating whether it should be called “ Pr-eye-mark ” or “ Pree-mark ” .
Finally , Primark have revealed the correct way to say their store name .
In the ‘ other stuff ' segment of their ‘ queries ' page , where you can search for FAQs , they answer the question : “ How do you pronounce Primark ? ”
They responded saying : “ That 's a very good question . We like to use Pr-Eye-Mark . ”
Have you been wrong this entire time ? How do you say Primark ?
When I began fundraising for CircleUp six years ago , I encountered many investors whose eyes would glaze over when I mentioned “ consumer . ”
These investors would fidget uncomfortably or drop their gaze when I explained that our platform would only provide capital to small CPG companies . I would often hear the skeptical comments , such as , “ an energy bar company ca n't really get that big , ” “ baby food is n't scalable , ” and my personal favorite , “ I ca n't name a single consumer company ” ( real quote from a VC ) .
Today , of course , the tone is much different . Scroll through tech news and you 'll see everything from Greylock Partners singing the praises of CPG startups , Sequoia 's Michael Moritz joining the board of Charlotte Tilbury , to Lightspeed Ventures coinvesting with VMG Partners , a top mid-market consumer firm .
Alongside blockchain and AI , “ technology-enabled ” CPG startups are now a bona fide trend for Silicon Valley VCs . The uptick in tech VC dollars going to the CPG market is partly because tech investing is brutally competitive and saturated , and largely because these VCs are awakening to the strong historical returns in CPG , especially with the trend leaning towards small brands stealing market share .
Consumer is a massive market – about 3x the size of tech , as seen below .
Despite the size of the market , the early-stage has historically been underserved by investors due to market inefficiencies like the geographic dispersion of brands and a lack of structured information sources ( i.e . there is no Silicon Valley for consumer , and certainly no Crunchbase equivalents – yet ) . In theory , the recent trend of VC dollars going to fill a capital gap in CPG should result in a win-win . In effect , many of the tech VC investments into consumer are misguided , and sometimes even harmful . Investors may lose money , but entrepreneurs can lose companies they 've spent lifetimes building .
There are a few things that VC investors should keep in mind to ensure they invest in a way that benefits both them and the entrepreneurs they work with .
One company wo n't rule its market
The heart of the problem with tech investors in CPG is that they operate under the assumption that one CPG player can rule its market . They believe this because in tech , it 's largely true . When you look at Uber and Airbnb , it is likely that one or two players could own 70 % of their respective markets . Holding this assumption in the CPG space , however , in fundamentally flawed .
There has been a secular shift over the past 5-10 years where people now favor unique , targeted products catering to personal preferences . Today , even the act of selecting a beer or hand lotion is a form of self-expression . The result is a fragmentation with many brands that are more targeted in their offering . Many of these products are inherently smaller in scale and never intend to be mass market—yet do frequently get gobbled up by public consumer conglomerates . The M & A in consumer and retail was over $ 300 billion in 2017 according to PWC , vs. $ 170b for tech .
While the market grows more and more fragmented with small to mid-sized brands offering diversified products , we 're moving far away from the notion that one condiment or baby products brand can own 70 % of its category .
Too-high valuations and large raises are harmful , not encouraging
Relatedly , putting too high a valuation on a CPG company and theorizing it could rule its market is counterproductive and unrealistic . It pushes the entrepreneur to unnatural and harmful tactics to meet this valuation , or to eventually fundraise again at a lower valuation – or at a higher valuation from whatever out-of-tune investor they can find to do – then seriously struggle to exit . Some of the spiraling is obvious , including inflated marketing campaigns that force growth , often long before the product is ready , and some are less obvious , including inflated numbers in investor decks behind the scenes .
Ask anyone knowledgeable in consumer about why Unilever bought Seventh Generation instead of the similar , but far more trendy Honest Company . It 's largely because of valuation . By every account , the VCs involved in Honest Company put a valuation in previous rounds that made no sense relative to core metrics . Consumer companies should n't raise $ 30m in equity to grow , let alone $ 300m . The result : Honest Company could n't get the exit it wanted , had to cut costs , and reportedly faced tremendous unrest among employees who were upset about the direction the company was heading .
Ultimately , CPG brands do n't need that much money to grow . Capital efficiency is one of the beauties of CPG . Consumer companies can typically raise $ 4-8m to get to $ 10m in revenue , where they are often profitable . Tech companies typically raise $ 40-50m to get to the same revenue range , and often fail to make a profit even at that point . SkinnyPop , RXBar , Sir Kensington 's and Native Deodorant are great examples of the lean operations characteristic of CPG .
A great brand is n't as simple as a D2C model and a sleek website
In the past year I 've had 10-20 tech VCs call me and say some variation on this : “ we want to get into consumer , but it has to be tech enabled , because we told our LPs we 'd invest in tech companies. ” This overfocus on D2C leads VCs to put too much money into the company at too high a valuation .
D2C is a channel . Just like the convenience store channel ( i.e . 7/11 ) , club ( Costco ) , mass ( Walmart ) and grocery ( Safeway ) . Like these other channels , DTC has pros and cons . It is not a Holy Grail . Too often , we see inexperienced VCs talk about D2C as “ lower cost ” when in reality the average D2C brand raises 10-30x the amount of brands in the offline world with massive overvaluations . Tell a D2C entrepreneur that their channel is cheaper than offline , and she will quickly explain to you that the Customer Acquisition Costs in the past 3-5 years have made that no longer true . If D2C is better margins , why did Bonobos raise $ 127m , Dollar Shave Club raise $ 164m and Casper raise $ 240m ?
D2C is a channel , but it does not change the underlying fundamentals of what makes a successful CPG company . Those fundamentals , aside from margins and team , are brand , distribution and product differentiation . Product differentiation in consumer is necessary , but not sufficient , for success . The product must be unique relative to other offerings , and in a way that matters to people . Kind Bar looked like real food relative to Clif Bar , 5 Hour Energy was the only energy drink fit for on-the-go , and Halo Top gave you permission to eat a whole pint in one sitting . If those sound silly , they are all billions-dollar companies that each raised far less than the typical tech company , thus with less dilution .
The way forward
Consumer is an amazing market with massive depth and presents a wonderful opportunity for investors to help build the dreams of entrepreneurs with them . If VCs truly want to succeed in this market , they need to take the time to understand the fundamentals of consumer investing . I hope that more investors catch on to this so that wonderful consumer entrepreneurs can continue to get the capital and resources they need to thrive .

Cristiano Felicio of the Bulls gets a hand up on Raptor Kyle Lowry in Tuesday night 's game at the United Center . ( Chris Sweda / TNS )
CHICAGO—They are all accepting of blame because there are all kinds of it to go around . They all accept responsibility for this month-long freefall because everyone 's done his part to make it happen . The Toronto Raptors are saying all the right things , but not doing them . In the wake of the latest defeat , a gruesome 105-94 loss administered by the Chicago Bulls , there was much inward-looking angst emanating from a team that 's now lost 11 of its last 15 games in a plummet through the Eastern Conference standings . “ It starts with our leaders , me and DeMar , ” Kyle Lowry said after the Raptors were listless and effort-free for almost three entire quarters . “ We have to figure it out , find ways to push our teammates to be better and push ourselves to be better. ” Or maybe it starts higher up the food chain .

“ This game is tough . If you 're not ready mentally , physically ready to start the game and be in a tough mindset , the game gets away from you quick , and we were n't ready to play , ” coach Dwane Casey said . “ I take the blame for that , not having the guys jacked up and ready to play the first half. ” But no matter who accepts responsibility , the simple fact is the Raptors are playing horribly more often than not , and talking about it has n't resolved a thing . “ It feels like s -- - . What do you mean ? ” Cory Joseph said when asked what it feels like to be a Raptor today . “ It feels bad . Whoops , it feels bad . There is no other way to describe it . We want to win games . ”
They wo n't win games playing like they did in the first 30 minutes against the Bulls , who now have an 11-game winning streak against the Raptors . Some ugly unforced turnovers , some lackadaisical defence and some plodding , uninspired offence got them into a 23-point hole they could n't escape . There was an obligatory run that carved the deficit to five with about two minutes to go , but that was as close as they got . “ We just did n't play hard , obviously , in the first half , ” Lowry said . “ Small mistakes led to bigger mistakes , and we just did n't play hard . “ We let turnovers get our heads down , missed shots get our heads down , I missed a wide-open three in the corner and I put my hands up ( in disgust ) . Me , I ca n't do that , we ca n't do that . We just have to play harder. ” Patrick Patterson missed his fifth game with a bruised left knee , but he 's inching closer to a return and will be the one to decide when he 's back . “ He 's still not 100 per cent , but he has been medically cleared so it 's up to him , ” Casey said Tuesday morning . “ He has to feel his body . . . that is where it is right now. ” Jakob Poeltl started his second game in Patterson 's place , but with the imminent arrival of Serge Ibaka , a power forward hole has been filled . Poeltl was replaced to start the second half by Norm Powell as the Raptors tried to change the tempo of the game — and their fortunes after a truly wretched first half . It did n't work particularly well as Chicago pulled away . Casey dug even further into his bag of lineup tricks late in the third quarter , using a tiny group of Lowry , Joseph , DeMar DeRozan , Delon Wright and Lucas Nogueira . With just over a quarter of the season left , the Raptors find themselves out of a home-court position for the playoffs — as if that would matter . “ I do n't know how many months or days that is , but 25 games is not a lot of games . They can go by in a heartbeat , ” Lowry said . “ If we lose four more , we 're only four games over .500 . I do n't know what place we 'd be in . I do n't know where we are now ; I know we 're not in the top four right now . “ We have to figure something out . We have to go on a helluva run to finish the season out . ”

Netflix has renewed its Danish sci-fi thriller “ The Rain ” for a second season , the streaming giant announced Wednesday . The news comes less than a month after the eight-episode first season debuted on Netflix on May 4 . The second season will shoot later this year for a 2019 launch .
The first Danish original series commissioned by Netflix , “ The Rain ” follows two young siblings who embark on a perilous search for safety after a brutal virus wipes out most of the population .
“ 'The Rain ' has a relatable and human story at its core and touches on universal themes everyone can identify with , ” said Kelly Luegenbiehl , vice president of international original at Netflix . “ The fact that Season 1 reached audiences all over the world proves once again that strong stories can transcend borders . ”
Created by Jannik Tai Mosholt , Esben Toft Jacobsen and Christian Potalivo , “ The Rain ” stars Alba August , Mikkel Boe Følsgaard , Lucas Lynggaard Tønnesen , Lars Simonsen , Sonny Lindberg , Jessica Dinnage , Lukas Løkken and Johannes Kuhnke .
KUALA LUMPUR ( Reuters ) - Malaysia has barred controversial Bollywood film “ Padmaavat ” from being screened in theatres , the home ministry said on Friday , citing the movie 's negative portrayal of a Muslim ruler .
The film has already attracted protests in India , after groups critical of the project accused its director , Sanjay Leela Bhansali , of distorting history by portraying the Muslim ruler as the “ lover ” of Queen Padmavati of the Hindu Rajput warrior clan .
Last month , India 's top court allowed the film to be screened nationwide , despite moves to ban it in two states .
But in Muslim-majority Malaysia , authorities have instead rejected the portrayal of Sultan Alauddin Khilji and banned the film .
“ He is portrayed as a Sultan who is arrogant , cruel , inhumane , devious with all kinds of trickery , unreliable and who does not fully practice Islamic teachings , ” the ministry said in a statement .
Malaysia 's Film Censorship Board ruled that the movie was “ not approved for screening ” , while an appeal lodged by the film 's distributors was rejected on Tuesday , the ministry said .
Bollywood films are popular in Malaysia , where ethnic Indians make up seven percent of the country 's 32 million people .
Malaysia has previously blocked the release of Hollywood movies deemed religiously insensitive , such as 1998 's “ The Prince of Egypt ” , which depicted the Biblical story of Moses , and 1995 's “ Babe ” , which featured a pig as the main character . Muslims consider pigs unclean .
Last May , the release of Walt Disney 's “ Beauty and the Beast ” was held up over a “ gay moment ” in the film .
The verisimilitude of their encounter started conversations about dating , power and consent . ( There has also been a backlash and a backlash to the backlash . )
“ Cat Person ” focuses on two characters , Margot and Robert , who begin to construct a relationship through texting and eventually go on something resembling a date .
The piece dominated attention on social media in a way that fiction rarely does . On Sunday , Roupenian 's follower count climbed rapidly as her more eager readers finished the story and set out to find its creator .
Writer Kristen Roupenian had fewer than 200 followers on Twitter before her work of fiction , “ Cat Person , ” was published in the New Yorker last week .
You told the New Yorker that the story was inspired by a nasty encounter online . How long did it take you to write ?
On Sunday , stunned by the response to her story , she agreed to be interviewed by email . What follows has been condensed and edited .
Roupenian , 36 , is on a writing fellowship at the University of Michigan , where she recently completed a master 's degree . She has only committed to writing in the past five years and is finalizing a story collection and working on a novel .
I wrote the story immediately after the encounter — within a week — and finished a first draft in a matter of days . Once the basic story was complete , I held onto it and tinkered with it for a month or so , gave it to a few trusted readers and then sent it to my agent .
That said , the themes of the story ( sex , gender , power , consent ) are ones that I 've been thinking about , and trying to write about , for years … It 's not autobiographical ; though many of the details and emotional notes come from life , they were accumulated over decades , not drawn from a single bad date .
You 've wanted to be a writer for a long time , but you said you 've only really committed in the last five years . Was there a catalyst ?
Ha , yeah . I was at a bar with my friend . I was close to finishing my Ph.D. , and I 'd made it through almost the entire process of entering the Foreign Service . I 'd had a few beers , and I was talking passionately about how , by becoming a diplomat , I was going to live my second-best-possible life . It was n't my No . 1 , absolute dream , but it was pretty great … and trying to be a writer was too risky . And she was like : “ Uh , that seems like a terrible reason to join the Foreign Service . I think you 'll regret this choice on your deathbed . You should write your novel . ”
So I did . And then there was a government hiring freeze , so I did n't get to join the Foreign Service anyway , and that novel did n't work out either , but by then I was hooked .
A lot of writers have difficulty working text messaging ( and cellphones ) into stories . Was that a challenge for you ?
I worried about being boring — text messages are hard to work into stories because it 's not easy to build a scene around someone sitting alone and staring at a phone . I dealt with that by introducing secondary characters for Margot to talk to about the texts — the stepdad , Tamara — which both helped keep the scenes from becoming static and felt true to life .
What about Robert and Margot 's exchange is unique to modern technology ?
I think conducting the early stages of flirtation via text allows us to control even more of what we present to ourselves to other people , and gives us a lot of space to imagine what kind of person exists on the other side of conversation . And the things we imagine might not always turn out to be accurate . But the gender dynamics , the uncertainty , the fear — that all predates tech , for sure .
Every so often Margot gets a flash of actual insight into Robert 's mindset . But her empathy ropes her into continuing the date . Can empathy be a double-edged sword ?
That 's exactly right . Margot 's empathetic imagination is working on overdrive here , and throughout the story . Her skills at reading other people make her socially adept , but because imaginative empathy is still , fundamentally , imagination , she is also easily misled .
She thinks she can see inside Robert ; she believes she knows more about him than she does , and that keeps the date catapulting forward when it might otherwise have come to an end . The people I know who tend to be drawn to the most troubled men are these incredibly empathetic , imaginative young women , and sometimes I wonder if that 's a piece of it : how good they are at creating a compelling backstory for men who have done nothing to earn it .
Much of the conversation about the story has revolved around the sex . A pivotal paragraph starts , “ Yeah , right , she thought , and then he was on top of her again. ” Can you talk about writing that ?
It 's an uncomfortable moment . It was uncomfortable to write , and my sense is it 's uncomfortable to read . ( It 's definitely an uncomfortable scene to know that your mom has read ! ) But it 's an aspect of the story that people are responding to , so I 'm glad I kept my gaze steady on it and did n't look away .
What is Margot wishing for when she imagines the boy with whom she could share the story of this encounter ? Why does she decide “ no such boy existed , and never would ” ?
Well , it 's an irony of heterosexual relationships , right , that you 're searching for a partner who has experienced the world so much differently than you have , and whose romantic and sexual history is so different from your own ? That 's a pain a lot of women I know have felt acutely , especially in this past year , when all of these terrible shared experiences are becoming part of the public conversation . Women try to talk about these experiences with their partners , and they find themselves failing . It 's an isolating feeling for both people involved .
But for Margot , it 's true , too , that one of the reasons she ca n't ever imagine sharing this particular experience with a partner is that she herself does n't understand it , so how can she explain it ? That 's true in a way that goes beyond gender , of course , and is maybe just a fundamental human impulse : I wish I had someone who could explain my story to me !
The story 's last exchange gives the clearest view yet of who Robert is . Did you always know how it was going to end ? Verbatim ?
Yep .
Do you hate cats ?
Nah . Cats are great . They 're a little creepy , but I like things that are creepy . I have a dog who hates cats , though , so I do n't get to hang out with them much .
Authorities say a teenager who was running from a dog accidentally shot himself in North Charleston Monday night .
Officials with North Charleston police say the 16-year-old will be charged with unlawful possession of a firearm by a person under 18 .
According to police , the incident happened on Dublin Street . The juvenile was transported for treatment .
Police responded to the 3200 block of Dublin Road , near the Pepperhill community , according to Charleston County Consolidated Dispatch .
The call came in at 7:02 p.m .
EMS and North Charleston Fire crews also responded .

When Conor Healy was a freshman at Harvard , he applied to take a freshman seminar class on free speech . Originally from Toronto , Healy chose the class because free speech seemed to be a popular topic in the United States when he arrived .
“ I took it because I thought I could learn a lot — and I did , ” Healy told USA TODAY College .
The students in the course learned about a number of issues : the First Amendment , Holocaust denialism , whether hate speech should be banned , and more .
During the class , Healy met another student , Francisco Trujillo . Inspired by their free speech class and conversations with their peers about politics , they created Harvard 's first club dedicated to free speech : The Open Campus Initiative .
“ We decided to seek out some method for advocating for the things that we learned and we realized that there was no group at Harvard interested in open dialogue , ” Healy said .
Together — Healy is president , Trujillo is vice president — they now run the club , which held their first meeting in January and now boasts 35 general members and 6 board seats . “ Word spread very quickly , ” Healy said .
In addition to holding weekly meetings to discuss free speech , the group also invites controversial speakers to campus , like Jordan B. Peterson , a professor of psychology at the University of Toronto .
Peterson is well-known for his refusal to use gender-neutral pronouns . Protesters came to Peterson 's lecture and held up signs , including some that said “ Fight Transphobia , ” but they did not interfere with Peterson 's ability to deliver his lecture .
“ I was really pleasantly surprised there were no disruptions , ” Healy told the Harvard Crimson after the event .
Natalie Bao Tram Le , a master 's degree student in government at Harvard , told USA TODAY College she appreciates the Open Campus Initiative .
“ The Open Campus Initiative is very much needed at Harvard to promote free speech and expression , ” Le said , noting that she felt like some students and faculty have been impeded from “ from expressing their thoughts and ideas ” in recent years .
Le also attended Peterson 's lecture . “ The attendees — minus the protesters , obviously — really enjoyed his lecture , ” she said .
Diego Garcia , an undergrad also studying government who also attended the Peterson lecture , noted that his attendance did not imply agreement with his views .
“ I would like to express that those students like myself who attended the event may or may not agree with what Professor Peterson had to say , ” Garcia said . “ We simply are willing to listen and learn his views . This is why we are college students , after all . The ideas these speakers bring are interesting to hear , even if I disagree with them . ”
Kent Haeffner , a junior at Harvard studying government , and the president of the Harvard Republican Club , concurred .
“ Bringing different viewpoints to campus , even if you do n't agree with them , I think is something that is still valuable , ” he told USA TODAY College . “ Free speech is something that is very important and valuable , and an organization specifically devoted to that cause is a great asset to our university . ”
Not everyone 's a fan , of course .
Dissenting opinion : the Open Campus Initiative is a move backward for # Harvard . https : //t.co/nGSsaM6sZo pic.twitter.com/GyRp1RfklK — The Crimson Opinion ( @ CrimsonOpinion ) April 14 , 2017
According to Harvard 's websites , student organizations are required to secure a faculty or administrative advisor before they can become an approved organization . The club 's advisor , Professor Harry Lewis , declined to comment on the club . He noted that he has been a symbolic advisor to many clubs in the past , without necessarily being involved in their programming .
“ I tend to think that if students want a club they should have a club , as long as it is operating within the bounds of College policy , ” he said in a statement .
Next semester , the group plans to bring even more speakers to campus . They 've already extended an invitation to author Charles Murray , and they 're working on inviting a host of other speakers to campus as well .
“ The plan is to saturate the campus with such a wide range of alternative views that people feel more comfortable challenging ideology and speaking up , ” Healy told USA TODAY College .
He noted that some students can be “ scared ” to have open conversations on campus . “ We want to improve the ability for dialogue on a wide range of subjects , using a wide range of approaches , ” he said .
This “ wide range of approaches ” includes the possibility of even starting a club newspaper he said — noting a “ dream ” future endeavor .
In all , Healy said he just wants to promote open conversations on campus . “ Discourse will not cower in the face of the shutting down mentality , ” he concluded .

CANBERRA-An Australian study has shed new light on the mystery of how the solar system formed in a cloud of gas and dust in space billions of years ago .
The joint study , led by The Australian National University ( ANU ) and the University of Crete in Greece , unravelled the mystery when examining a star-forming cloud called Musca , which appears as a needle in the southern sky .
Lead researcher Dr. Aris Tritsis , from the ANU , said the study visualised the 3D shape of Musca , which lies hundreds of light years away from Earth .
The large gas cloud , formed mainly of molecular hydrogen and dust , stretches 27 light years across the plain of the sky , with a depth of about 20 light years and width up to a fraction of a light year . `` We were able to reconstruct the 3D structure of a gas cloud in its very early stages of making new stars and planets , which will ultimately take millions of years to form , '' said Tritsis , from the ANU Research School of Astronomy and Astrophysics . `` Knowledge of the 3D shape of clouds will greatly improve our understanding of these nurseries of stars and the birth of our own solar system . ''
The study , which was part of Tritsis ' PhD thesis , has made use of data from the European Space Agency 's Herschel space telescope .
He said scientists could now use Musca as a model to learn how stars and planets formed .
`` With its 3D shape now determined , Musca can be used as a laboratory for testing star formation , astrochemical and dust-formation theories , '' Tritsis said .
`` We see , for the first time , that this cloud is not a thin , static streak of gas in space , but a vibrating , complex structure . Despite its needle-like appearance , Musca actually resembles a sheet viewed edge-on . ''
Musca is surrounded by ordered hair-like structures called striations , which are produced by trapped waves of gas and dust caused by the global vibrations of the cloud . The research team was able to determine the shape of Musca by analyzing the spatial frequencies of these vibrations , which were then converted into ringing tones to reveal the `` Song of Musca '' .
`` This is a cloud in space that is singing to us - all we had to do was listen . It 's actually quite awesome , '' Tritsis said . In addition to providing new insights into star and planet formation , the model of Musca cloud also be used to see how molecules form in gas clouds .
Co-researcher Dr. Konstantinos Tassis , from the University of Crete , said Musca was the largest structure in the Milky Way galaxy found to be vibrating as a whole . `` There 's a whole range of new things we can learn from this model , '' Tassis said . The team 's research is published in the journal , Science .
J-pop metal group BABYMETAL have parlayed their meteoric rise into tour dates alongside Metallica , Guns N ' Roses , and Red Hot Chili Peppers . Now , they 've announced plans for their very own Fire Fox Festival set to take place in Japan over nine days this summer .
In an interesting twist that could only come from BABYMETAL , there are strict conditions required to attend each of these dates . Specifically , the festival is broken down into categories by age group , gender , and dress code . For example , one date is reserved exclusively for males , another for females , and another for teenagers . Even more randomly is the day when only elementary school children and people over the age of 60 ( um , what ? ) will be granted admittance . If you 're outside that demo , you can always attend the show requiring corpse paint to be worn .
( Read : The 25 Most Anticipated Tours of 2017 )
“ Each show has its own specific conditions which purchasers must abide by , ” the band says via its website . “ Please make sure that all of the conditions are met before you make the purchase . In the case that the purchaser does not meet the specific conditions and wins the ticket , we reserve the right to refuse admittance . ”
The Five Fox Festival takes place in July and August after BABYMETAL finish up its remaining US dates . After wrapping up their support of the Red Hot Chili Peppers , the group will play a special headlining show in Los Angeles and select June dates on Korn 's tour with Stone Sour .

Escalating tensions between North Korea and President Donald Trump have prompted mixed reaction among Korean expatriates in Metro Detroit .
While threats from North Korean leader Kim Jong-un are n't new , some said the rhetoric from both sides over advances in the country 's nuclear weapons that are nearing the ability to target the United States has raised the conflict to a new level .
“ I was worried so much , ” said Denise Lee , who taught a youth group Sunday morning at the Korean Presbyterian Church of Metro Detroit in Southfield and has two siblings in South Korea . “ I have watched CNN a lot . It just seems to be more intense . ”
Lee said she 's concerned Trump 's aggressive response could push the North Korean leader into rash action .
“ You can pinch him a little but do n't go so hard , ” said Lee , who came to the United States from South Korea in the 1990s .
Others among Metro Detroit 's some 17,000 Korean or Korean-Americans applauded Trump 's bellicose behavior . While previous administrations have been more measured , Trump 's language with North Korea is more fiery , something Bruce Park of Rochester appreciates .
“ Do it ! Show him , ” said Park , who was born in South Korea and publishes a local Korean newspaper . “ That is the best way to stop ( Kim ) . Someone has to show him that threatening with nuclear weapons is not going to work . ”
Tensions grew further when North Korea announced late last week a plan to launch missiles toward Guam , a tiny U.S. territory and major military hub about 2,000 miles from the North 's capital . Trump responded , boasting that the U.S. military “ locked and loaded ” and warned that Kim “ will regret it fast ” if he takes any action against U.S. territories or allies .
Senior U.S. national security officials say a military confrontation with North Korea 's is n't imminent . But they 're also saying that the possibility of war with the reclusive Asian nation is greater than it was a decade ago .
CIA Director Mike Pompeo said there 's “ nothing imminent today ” on “ Fox News Sunday ” but said North Korea 's push to develop a nuclear-tipped ballistic missile capable of hitting the United States “ is a very serious threat and the administration is going to treat it as such . ”
Trump 's national security adviser , H.R . McMaster , told ABC 's “ This Week ” that “ we 're not closer to war than a week ago , but we are closer to war than we were a decade ago . ”
The saber-rattling was n't too alarming to other Metro Detroit Koreans and has n't risen to even a topic of social media discussions in most Korean and Korean-American communities , some said
“ We feel nervous about this but ( Kim 's ) words are pretty empty , ” said the Rev . Seung Wong Yu on Sunday while preparing for his Sunday service at Korean Presbyterian Church . “ We have experienced this so many times . ”
Yu 's father was born in North Korea and left the country for South Korea in his 20s . He said his uncle and grandfather were killed in the country .
Yu said he 'd prefer Trump tone down his aggressive response but “ I think we need something like that for North Korea . ”
“ We need to stop them from developing these atomic bombs , ” he said .
The threat comes as Koreans prepare to celebrate a holiday Tuesday commemorating the United States and the Soviet Union liberation of Korea from Japanese rule in 1945 .
Few South Koreans and Korean-Americans would agree with a military attack on Korean peninsula , said Young Rae Oum , a former assistant professor at Michigan State University who teaches at the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley .
“ Many Korean people do not believe that there is a possibility for imminent war , ” she said in an email to The Detroit News . “ Most Korean people believe that both Trump and Kim are ‘ bluffing ' because if either was really going to attack the other , it would be ridiculous to release in advance such detailed ‘ attack plans . ' North Korea is not even a topic of discussion on most Korean and Korean-American online communities . ”
She said that the current South Korean president , Moon Jae-in , has advocated gradual reconciliation with North Korea and readdressed his position with Trump during a phone conversation this month .
Meanwhile , the North Korean leader is young and worried about losing power , said Park of Rochester .
“ If Trump wanted to send in troops ... Kim Jong-un knows he would be in big trouble , ” Parks said .

One man 's botched car repair work is another man 's warning .
“ There 's nothing I can do about this and I do n't want to deal with the same guy again , ” said Addison Chang .
The 75-year-old was in the parking lot of Times Supermarket in Kahala when he was approached by a man who said he owned a mobile auto body shop and offered to fix the dents .
Before he could say no , Chang says the man started working on the car on the spot in the parking lot .
“ At that point , it was too late already , but they fixed the front , not exactly perfect , ” explained Chang .
The bill came to $ 820 . Chang was frustrated when he noticed a hole that was n't there before on the inside of the door .
“ They used this hole to pull out the dent , ” he said .
Now Chang says he has to fork over more money to fix the repairs .
Is it legal to operate a mobile auto body shop here in Hawaii ?
According to Stephen Levins , executive director of the state Department of Commerce and Consumer Affairs ' Office of Consumer Protection , “ It 's hard when you say legal . It 's not per se illegal , but the devil 's in the details on this type of thing . ”
Levins says there 's no state law forbidding mobile auto body shops . Unless they 're doing mechanical work , they are n't required to be licensed .
But they ca n't work just anywhere .
“ If you 're operating in a shopping center , the shopping center may have prohibitions against doing that , ” Levins said .
Times Supermarkets management tells us it does not allow mobile auto body shops to perform work on its property . A manager says he recently had to chase a mobile auto body shop away from the parking lot .
DCCA says while there are plenty of reputable businesses , be wary of who approaches you .
“ Do n't just give up your money because someone says they 'll do a job for you and get a good deal . A lot of times , those are n't true , ” Levins said .
Chang says learn from him : “ I want the people of Hawaii to know , if somebody approaches you in a parking lot , beware that something might happen . ”

RIO DE JANEIRO - A mega-strike by Brazilian truck drivers furious over high fuel costs entered day nine Tuesday , despite a slight easing in the transport nightmare that has paralyzed Latin America 's biggest economy and rattled the unpopular government .
With reports of some key roadblocks lifted by truckers and an increase in the flow of fuel from refineries , buses and goods vehicles slowly started to get back on the road . But significant numbers of truckers remained determined to hold on , even though their initial demands for cheaper fuel have been met .
The stubbornness of part of the truckers surprised the center-right government and even some union leaders , prompting allegations that the protests were being manipulated to try and bring down President Michel Temer .
Rio de Janeiro , where almost all gas stations have been shut for several days , saw some fuel deliveries Tuesday . A column of 300 food trucks also made it into the city , where many supermarkets have run out of fresh products , G1 reported .
Public schools in Rio reopened Tuesday after a day of being closed .
In São Paulo , the big Ribeirao Preto oil terminal was back online after the truckers ' blockade was lifted .
However , despite these partial improvements , transport remained paralyzed in much of the country , crippling the vast agricultural industry and making commutes a nightmare for millions . Ten airports remained out of aviation fuel , the Infraero airports ' administration said .
The standoff continued despite Temer agreeing on Sunday to a key demand to cut the price of diesel fuel . Late Monday , Temer said he had `` absolute conviction that between today and tomorrow '' the crisis , would finally end . Experts say that even if the strike winds down soon , the knock-on effects could take weeks to settle , dealing a severe blow to an economy struggling to grow again after a record deep recession that last two years .
The crisis comes ahead of October presidential elections where voters are in an angry , anti-establishment mood .
Temer , who is Brazil 's most unpopular president in history , is not running for reelection and some activists said the truck strike could be used to spearhead his early departure . At a road block set up by truckers outside Rio de Janeiro , an AFP reporter saw numerous signs calling for a military coup , while others spoke of ousting Temer . `` We 've had enough of all this corruption . If more people come out into the streets , the government will fall , it 's sure , '' said Tango Roxa , an electrical appliances salesman who joined the truckers to express his support . The president of the Brazilian Association of Truck Drivers , Jose da Fonseca Lopes , alluded to this hardening of opinions , saying that `` it 's no longer truckers who are on strike ... It 's people who want to bring down the government . I 've got nothing to do with these people . ''
A key Temer minister , Eliseu Padilha , spoke of unidentified groups `` infiltrating the movement with different , essentially political goals . ''
A poll by Ideia BigData found that 95 percent of Brazilians disapproved of his handling of the situation , even if 55 percent opposed the strike itself .
Temer took power in controversial circumstances in 2016 , following the impeachment and removal from office of his leftist predecessor Dilma Rousseff for breaking budget rules .
The president 's market-friendly , center-right government launched into sweeping austerity reforms that have been widely praised by investors as a bid to return Brazil to fiscal health , but proved hugely unpopular with ordinary Brazilians .
Golf - Big hitters will rule Erin Hills , says Leonard

ERIN , Wisconsin ( Reuters ) - With Dustin Johnson a distracted dad , Rory McIlroy a little rusty and third-ranked Jason Day trying to put it all together in 2017 , the door could be open for another first-time major winner in the U.S. Open at Erin Hills .
Yet former British Open champion Justin Leonard thinks the run of six successive first-time major winners is set to end at the hands of one of the big hitters .
`` I think the guys that hit it a long ways and keep it in play for the most part are going to be at an advantage , '' Leonard told Reuters on the eve of Thursday 's opening round .
`` I 'm in that Dustin Johnson , Rory McIlroy , Jason Day , Adam Scott kind of area .
`` Guys that drive the ball a very long way and hit it pretty straight . ''
The sprawling , 7,741-yard course , the longest ever to host a U.S. Open , has been softened by rain this week .
If Leonard 's crystal ball is accurate , the string of new major champions will end , following breakthrough wins by Sergio Garcia ( 2017 Masters ) , Jimmy Walker ( 2016 PGA ) , Henrik Stenson ( 2016 British Open ) , Johnson ( 2016 U.S. Open ) , Danny Willett ( 2016 Masters ) and Day ( 2015 PGA ) .
Asked who was best placed to keep that streak alive , Leonard nominated world number nine Rickie Fowler .
`` I think that the next guy that 's probably due is Rickie Fowler , just because of the talent level and the fact that three years ago he finished top five in all four majors , '' said Leonard , the 1997 British Open winner at Royal Troon and now a commentator on Golf Channel .
`` His game is showing that kind of maturity . ''
Leonard said emerging young players Hideki Matsuyama of Japan and Jon Rahm of Spain , seeking their first major , had the talent to win but their lack of experience might let them down .
He felt the USGA was already a winner , however , for choosing Erin Hills as a first-time major venue .
`` I think it 's great . I think it presents lots of different challenges . I like that it keeps the driver in the players ' hands , '' he added .
`` You can say it is not a classic U.S. Open course .
`` But credit the USGA ( U.S . Golf Association ) for going outside the box a little bit for the next great venues in the United States . ''

Christine Angeli , director of the Milford Public Library , is n't holding her breath for a state grant that would help the city fund library renovations : There 's not much funding available , and there are other contenders for the state money .
But she told the aldermen at their August meeting that the city may as well apply and see what happens .
“ We 'll put our application in and see what we can get , ” Angeli told the aldermen . “ I do n't think there will be money in the future , so this might be our last chance to get some state funds for construction . ”
The library board already has plans drawn up for renovations , which is primarily a redistribution of space within the library .
Reclaiming office and other space on the lower level would double the amount of space in the children 's department and make it ADA compliant . Today , a virtual cavern of space just beyond the children 's library is used for office space and storage , and with changes that have taken place since the library was built in 1976 , that kind of space just is n't needed anymore .
The current children 's department is 2,000 square feet , and by expanding into the office and storage space , as well as reclaiming some space now used for technical services and deliveries , another 2,000 square feet would be added .
The library has expanded its programming in recent years , and children 's story hours alone attract 50 to 60 people .
“ And that 's a great time to make a connection with families , ” Angeli said .
But when the story is over , there is n't enough room for families and children to sit and browse through the books .
“ We do n't have the space for children to lounge and read for an hour , and I think that 's really important , ” Angeli said .
There also is n't enough room for children in wheelchairs to move down the book aisles conveniently .
Creating more space would also allow the staff to create different areas for children of different ages .
Similar changes would be made upstairs in the adult department , where office and storage rooms and other behind-the-scenes space would be reclaimed to create two small meeting rooms , “ something that patrons have been requesting on almost a daily basis , ” Angeli said .
Business people sometimes request space to meet , and students sometimes want a room where they can study together , Angeli added .
“ There 's a lot of space in the library that 's not public space , ” she said .
There is $ 1.7 million in state funds available in state library construction funds .
Of that , 80 % is for libraries looking at major or vital construction , and the rest is for cities like Milford looking to fund additions or renovations to their libraries .
So that 's only $ 340,000 in total funds , which other municipalities have applied for . Milford is hoping to get $ 245,000 — it 's a matching grant so the library would have to come up with another $ 245,000 from the city or private sources . Angeli said some could come from money earmarked for roof and other improvements , if there are funds left over in that account .
The total cost is expected to be $ 450,000 to $ 500,000 .
The grant “ is going to be extremely competitive , ” Angeli said .
If the city does n't get the money , the work is n't something that has to be done immediately . However , expanding space is n't a new idea , and it 's something library officials believe will really benefit library patrons .
A study done in the year 2000 study suggested similar changes .
State Rep. Kim Rose , who attended the Board of Aldermen 's meeting , said she was in favor of the city seeking the grant and said she will work with the other legislators to support the city 's bid for the funds .
Alderman Frank Smith also spoke up , saying there are limited funds at this difficult state budget time , encouraging the city to apply for them .
The aldermen voted unanimously to apply for the grant .

EXTRA-judicial killing carried out by the Police on a daily basis in Pakistan is not only illegal , unlawful and inhuman but also highly condemnable . It negatively affects faith in our legal system and courts .It is not only violative of law but also a brutal and inhuman act on the part of the police officials which shakes the legal framework of society and which in turn loses its trust in our judicial system . Under the law , police is to arrest the criminals and to investigate the crime but they can not exceed their limits , they can use reasonable force to arrest a criminal but killing of a person in the form of fake encounters , before arresting him , is a sheer illegal act .
It is the collective responsibility of the police and the judicial Magistrates of the area to have effective control over the local Police so that they perform their duties within their powers . Magistrates are empowered by the law , to direct the Superintendent of Police to take suitable measures for the protection and detection of crime . They are also empowered to inspect Police Stations in their jurisdictions . However it is correct to suggest that majority of magistrates prefer continuing to maintain harmonious relations with the Senior Police officials instead of urging them to impress upon their subordinates to attend to their duties effectively .
It is a duty of the Inspector-General of Police of each province to check and control crime and to see that all the officers subordinate to him perform their duties in accordance with law and that the gazetted officer personally supervise the investigations to ensure that it is faithfully carried out and whether or not they check the case diaries and make inspections of the police station and post falling under their jurisdiction . The Police Rules specifically requires that every police officer shall keep his temper thoroughly under control , and shall act with courtesy on all occasions and shall not allow his composure to be disturbed by the behaviour of others towards him and while defending himself or lawfully enforcing his authority , and shall act with calmness and shall use as little violence as possible . Police should be used strictly for the purpose for which it is established and law should be enforced in its real spirit .
Section 29 of the Police Act says that a Police officer who is guilty of any violation of any duty of wilful breach or neglect of any rule or regulation or lawful order made by competent authority or offers any unwarrantable violence to any person in his custody , shall be liable to 3 months imprisonment , besides being proceeded against departmentally . Under Article 9 of the Constitution of Pakistan , no person shall be deprived of life or liberty save in accordance with law . Article 10 of the Constitution provides safeguards against arrest and detention . It provides that no person who is arrested shall be detained in custody without being informed , as soon as may be , of the grounds for such arrest and every person who is arrested and detained shall be produced before a Magistrate within 24 hours of such arrest excluding the time necessary for journey from the place of arrest to the Court of the nearest Magistrate and that he shall not be detained in custody beyond the said period without the authority of a Magistrate . If any Police official is involved in extra-judicial killing , he must be punished under the strict clauses of Police Rules 1934 , Police Order 2002 , and Pakistan Penal Code 1860 .
Extra-judicial killing are a disgrace of law and can not be condoned . If the Police itself violates the law , they have no right to be described as custodian of law . It is alleged that whenever any complaint is made to the higher police authorities about excessive use of force by it they try to shield and protect their subordinates with the result that people lose all confidence in the departmental inquiries . Hardly any serious inquiry appears to be conducted by the police to find out the truth behind the extra judicial killings .

YERUSHALAYIM -
Monday , December 11 , 2017 at 6:09 pm |
Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu speaking at the International Conference on Digital Diplomacy at the Foreign Ministry in Yerushalayim last Thursday . ( Hadas Parush/Flash90 )
Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu has often touted the advances he 's made in building bridges to moderate Arab states , but a survey released on Monday showed that whatever their leaders think of him , the peoples in those countries remain extremely hostile .
According to a survey conducted by the highly-regarded Pew Research Center , an overwhelming number of Jordanians , Lebanese , Tunisians and Turks view Netanyahu “ very unfavorably. ” Even Syrian dictator Bashar Assad , whose brutal war policies have brought death and destruction to millions , was rated higher than Netanyahu .
For example , in Jordan , with which Israel has had a peace treaty since 1994 , 95 percent of the population said they view Netanyahu very unfavorably , with only 1 percent viewing him “ somewhat favorably , ” a tie with Assad .
Similarly , in Lebanon , 97 percent view him very unfavorably and none favorably at all .
In Turkey , the attitude was milder : 63 percent view Netanyahu very unfavorably , with 7 percent viewing him favorably and 14 percent unknown . That 's a shift from 2015 , when only 44 percent in Turkey did n't like him ; 9 percent rated him somewhat or very favorably , and 25 percent did not know .
This , despite the renewal of diplomatic relations between the two countries , might have been expected to help Netanyahu 's public image .
The Pew Center did not offer any explanation for the numbers , though media treatment of Israel and its leader in those countries undoubtedly has a decisive role in shaping public opinion .
As for how Israelis view other leaders in the region : Unsurprisingly Assad and Iranian President Hassan Rouhani led the disapproval ratings , each with 92 percent of Israelis viewing them unfavorably . Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan did n't fare much better ; disliked by 83 percent of the population .
The most favorable ratings went to Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi and Jordanian King Abdullah , with 44 percent of Israelis saying they view Sissi favorably , and 43 percent liking Abdullah .
The poll was conducted via face to face interviews between February and April . The number of people polled per country varied from 1,000 to 1,500 .
“ There are obviously some critical things that comes out of ( Saturday 's ) match but one of the things that does n't really change is our need to have a steely focus on the future and a long-term vision and plan around developing those ( high ) performance athletes , ” said Rugby Canada CEO Allen Vansen .
Whatever happens Saturday , Rugby Canada acknowledges there is more work to be done to better develop present and future talent .
The organization finds itself at another crossroads Saturday in Montevideo where Canada , trailing Uruguay after a 39-28 loss last weekend in Vancouver , looks for a win of 10 points or more to convert its second chance at making the 2019 Rugby World Cup in Japan .
After stumbling at the first hurdle of World Cup qualifying last summer , Rugby Canada fired its coach and initiated a structural makeover .
Qualifying for a ninth straight World Cup would allow Rugby Canada to quietly continue those renovations , while ensuring the World Rugby funding tap remains on . It would also help attract and hold onto sponsors .
Failure would invite closer scrutiny and move rugby to the further edges of an already crowded sports table .
Should Canada fail short at the Estadio Charrua , it will have one final chance at qualification via a repechage tournament in November , likely in France . There , the 21st-ranked Canadian men would likely face several higher-ranked countries for the tournament 's final berth .
Coach Kingsley Jones ' job appears safe , however . He only came on board in the fall and has received good reviews from his Rugby Canada bosses so far .
Should Canada get past Uruguay , it could start immediate planning for the World Cup , not to mention looking forward to an immediate injection of $ 448,000 ( U.S. ) from World Rugby in World Cup preparation money .
A win would also return Canada to the top 20 in the world rankings , at the expense of Spain . Uruguay will remain No . 17 even if it wins but could fall one down to No . 18 if it loses by more than 15 points .
Saturday 's winner slots into Group D at the 2019 World Cup in Japan as America 2 , alongside No . 4 Australia , No . 7 Wales , No . 10 Fiji and No . 12 Georgia .
Canada 's loss to the 17th-ranked U.S. Eagles last summer marked the first time the Canadian men had failed to qualify at the first attempt . That prompted a “ comprehensive review , ” Rugby Canada 's second look into the men 's program since the 2015 World Cup and third including the post-mortem on the men 's sevens failure to make the Rio Olympics .
The sevens review cost coach Liam Middleton his job . Kieran Crowley quit as 15s coach soon after signing a short contract extension in the wake of what was essentially a limited vote of confidence in his 2015 World Cup review .
The latest review resulted in the firing of New Zealand coach Mark Anscombe last August , just 16 months into the job . It also called for the hiring of a high-performance director , an academy/Canada ‘ A ' coach and more technical staff as well as use of a sports psychologist .
Some but not all of those recommendations have been acted on , with several jobs still to be filled . In the wake of last weekend 's loss , Jones cited the need for a full-time defence coach .
The changes continued . In November , Rugby Canada fired its top rugby man , general manager of rugby operations and performance Jim Dixon .
Dixon 's exit was paired with a restructuring that sees Rugby Canada downsize its corporate office in Richmond Hill , Ont. , and move several departments to its centre of excellence in Langford , B.C .
Getting involved in a pro rugby league remains a key goal , although Rugby Canada is taking its time so as not to bet on the wrong horse .
“ It 's a key part of being internationally competitive , ” Vansen said of pro rugby . “ The ability to attract and keep athletes playing the game , seeing an opportunity to be able to make a living playing the game is critically important .
“ Having those role models in your back yard or being able to connect with them is an important thing . ”
Vansen says Rugby Canada continues to hold talks with pro leagues , from the fledging Major League Rugby in the U.S. to Europe 's Pro 14 and the Super Rugby circuit in the Southern Hemisphere and Japan .
“ I think there 's lots of room for multiple processional rugby leagues in North America as the game grows and gets recognition and people get exposed to it and see how exciting it is , ” Vansen said .
While Super Rugby has been in contraction mode recently , Vansen believes the league still wants to still enter new markets after putting its own house in order .
Also on the domestic front , Vansen says his organization is also boosting its support of university and college rugby .
Top-ranked Rafael Nadal moved into the semifinals of the China Open by beating sixth-seeded John Isner 6-4 , 7-6 ( 0 ) on Friday .
The French Open and U.S. Open champion has won five titles this season and is closing in on the year-end No . 1 ranking .
`` In general terms , I think I played with not many mistakes , '' Nadal said . `` I do n't remember a lot of mistakes . I went to the net very often . I think I did the things that I want to do , and I did it well , so very happy . ''
Nadal saved all three break points he faced against Isner . He will next play third-seeded Grigor Dimitrov , who defeated Roberto Bautista Agut 7-6 ( 5 ) , 4-6 , 6-2 .
Dimitrov spent time practicing with Nadal in Mallorca ahead of the hard-court season . The two also spent time fishing .
`` We went out with the boat , '' Nadal said . `` We catch a few ones ( fish ) , but not very big . But we had some good dinner . ''
Nick Kyrgios also advanced . The eighth-seeded Australian won when opponent Steve Darcis retired from the match with a neck strain while trailing 6-0 , 3-0 .
Kyrgios will next face either second-seeded Alexander Zverev or Andrey Rublev .
Earlier , second-seeded Simona Halep reached the semifinals by beating Daria Kasatkina 6-2 , 6-1 .
The Romanian could take over the top ranking from Garbine Muguruza . She needs to reach the final and not lose to third-seeded Elena Svitolina .
Halep will next face either ninth-seeded Jelena Ostapenko or Sorana Cirstea .
Petra Kvitova advanced by beating Barbora Strycova 6-3 , 6-4 . The 12th-seeded Kvitova will next face either Svitolina or Caroline Garcia in the semifinals .
São Paulo ( Reuters ) - A Brazil-based spokeswoman for Boeing Co ( BA.N ) said on Friday that the structure of a potential tie-up with Brazilian planemaker Embraer SA ( EMBR3.SA ) was “ still being studied ” and nothing about a possible partnership had yet been defined .
A Brazilian government source told Reuters on Friday that the latest proposal for a tie-up between the planemakers would include the creation of a third company , as the top economics correspondent at Globo TV first reported .
Web hosting biz DreamHost is resisting a US government search warrant to turn over data about everyone who visited a website used to coordinate anti-Trump protests .
The website , disruptj20.org , is hosted by DreamHost , and was used to organize inauguration protests on January 20 , 2017 , in Washington DC , according to court documents filed by the Department of Justice . The government wants all records related to the website and those who used it .
Authorities have already pursued legal action against about 200 protesters , and they are now seeking information from DreamHost that should allow them to identify other protest participants – and anyone else who showed an interest in the demos or simply passed by the site .
DreamHost says the demanded data includes over 1.3 million IP addresses of its visitors , plus the contact information , submitted comments , email content , and photos of thousands of people . These IP addresses can be used to unmask broadband and cellphone subscribers .
`` That information could be used to identify any individuals who used this site to exercise and express political speech protected under the Constitution 's First Amendment , '' the company said in a blog post on Monday . `` That should be enough to set alarm bells off in anyone 's mind . ''
DreamHost received the government 's warrant on July 20 , and objected to it the following day .
A week later , the government filed a motion demanding that DreamHost show cause for resisting its order . In it , prosecutors argue that DreamHost offers no basis for claiming the warrant is overly broad .
Now DreamHost has taken its battle to the court of public opinion .
Ken White , an attorney who blogs at Popehat.com , shares DreamHost 's concern about amount of data requested by the government .
`` DreamHost 's brief illuminates the key issues : the search warrant is dangerously overbroad , and implicates protected speech , '' said White . `` The Department of Justice is n't just seeking communications by the defendants in its case . It 's seeking the records of every single contact with the site — the IP address and other details of every American opposed enough to Trump to visit the site and explore political activism . ''
White sees the government 's desire for data as particularly troubling because the Trump administration has expressed hostility toward protesters , has conflated all protesters with lawbreakers , and has characterized political opposition as being anti-American .
Troubling though this may be , it 's not without precedent . The Department of Justice has a history of asking for everything , and then accepting something less if there 's resistance , which does n't happen all the time . In 2006 , for example , the DoJ sought search records from at least 34 internet service providers in a quixotic effort to uphold the doomed 1998 Child Online Protection Act ( COPA ) . ®

ONE professional golfer who found it hard to contain her joy about the opportunity to play in a pair of ALPG events at Bonville and Coffs Harbour was local product Emma de Groot .
Years of playing on the American College circuit , the Symetra Tour and even having some starts in US LPGA means she speaks with plenty of confidence when she says that when the Australian Ladies Classic and Women 's NSW Open come to the Coffs Coast , her fellow ALPG professionals are about to find out how good the local courses are .
`` You spend your whole life as a junior travelling to all of the big cities and playing in all these events but we 've had this gem under our belt the whole time that was a little bit under-appreciated , I suppose , ” she said .
`` So it 's so exciting now that Coffs Harbour has been recognised as a city that can host big events and we have two world-class golf courses right here .
`` I 'm so excited for everybody to come and see not only what the city has to offer but what the courses have to offer . ”
The 29-year-old said being a junior at Coffs Harbour will bring both advantages and disadvantages come tournament time .
`` Obviously Coffs Harbour I played growing up so I know that course like the back of my hand . Bonville I played a little less frequently but obviously I still played it , so I certainly know the course and it 's definitely an advantage for me , ” she said .
`` Also just being able to stay at home only five minutes away and not have to worry about accommodation .
`` It 's also a mental test playing at your home course as well because you have the local support but with that comes the local pressure as well , so it 's about dealing with all of those expectations as well . ”

Wilburn previously served a dozen years on the city council in Iowa City . In 2006 , he was the first African-American to be elected mayor of Iowa City .
“ We welcome people here in Iowa . That 's what we do , no matter what you do or your background , but there are some disparties that need to be addressed , ” he said .
Wilburn , who is a Davenport native , joins seven other Democrats who 've been campaigning for governor this summer . Like his Democratic competitors , Wilburn supports repeal of GOP changes to Iowa 's collective bargaining law for public sector workers as well as a $ 15 minimum wage . Wilburn said Iowa cities and counties should have the authority to enforce a higher minimum wage , too , something Republican lawmakers have forbidden .
“ I 've talked to Democrats , Republicans , independents ( and ) Greens all over the state and they 're just kind of surprised by the bills that came out of the legislature under Republican leadership , ” Wilburn said , “ so it 's for those reasons that I 'm wanting to put my name out there , to get people involved . ”
Wilburn kicked his campaign off today with a news conference at the Iowa State Fair .

We 're all familiar with the popular proverb , “ It takes a village to raise a child. ” As a 21st century society , this still holds true , literally and figuratively . For non-millennials , who grew up in a vastly different era , there is a nostalgic mindset that a diverse community of inspiring people interacting with children has a positive and sustained life-changing impact on their development . By no means should this mean the village is responsible for raising your children , but we all have a stake in their development and success .
Early exposure to career choices are often the first step in the “ What do I want to be when I grow up ? ” conversation . Although definitive decisions wo n't be made for years to come , dreams and thoughts about future careers begin early . Whether policeman , fireman , truck driver , doctor , dentist , teacher , musician , sports star , and/or whatever it is their parents and relatives do , most children are passively aware and relate to the limited pool of occupations to which they are exposed .
While teachers offer an impressionable climate for first-hand learnings and experiences , parents provide the most important impact and stimulus on a child 's early life . Early exposure to non-traditional learning environments not only creates a generation of new dreamers and thought leaders , but also provides them with an eye-opening and novel perspective on the limitless opportunities that is their future .
From elementary to middle school , efforts to prepare students for college and beyond are taking hold earlier than ever as a childhood surrounded by books , scholastic support and diverse role models leave permanent impressions on a young person 's mind well into their late teens . That 's why early exposure to science , technology , engineering , arts and mathematics ( STEAM ) fields are especially important .
Reflected in its legacy history , American industry was built on innovation . To awaken dreams and inspire the next generation of innovators , problem-solvers and leaders , it 's imperative to expose children to STEAM at an early age . If engaged , receptive and they 've developed an interest by eighth grade , they 're three times more likely to pursue careers in STEAM fields later in life .
STEAM careers are at the forefront of some of the fastest-growing industries . Conversely , they also have some of the largest gender gaps as women comprise only 26 percent of all science , tech , engineering and mathematics jobs . As they continue to grow , women are getting left behind .
Many young girls are turning away from STEAM careers during their developmental years and have completely opted out by high school . That must change and we , the village ( with torches in hand ) , must step up to lead , advocate and champion that change .
For over three decades , the Ford Motor Company has been committed to supporting innovative initiatives that encourage and inspire young people to pursue and succeed in STEAM fields—a career path many , if not most , of today 's youth ( especially African American youth ) believe are out of reach for them .
Both within and outside the village , this is an important conversation that we must have as the future of our children is at stake . In addition to sponsorships , scholarships and aligning with synergy partners such as the National Newspaper Publishers Association ( NNPA ) , Ford has demonstrated its commitment in a hands-on way , connecting with and supporting a host of STEM and STEAM focused initiatives including Girls Who Code , Tech Sassy Girlz , STEMinista project , Destination Imagination , School Retool , Michigan Technological University , Amphi Middle School 's Girl Power in Science & Engineering , FIRST® Robotics and # WomenInSTEAM , among others .
Here in the U.S. and around the world , women are severely underrepresented in STEAM fields—career fields that are expected to grow more than 9 million jobs by 2022 . No surprise , both women and men are needed to fill those jobs and we , individually and collectively , must do our part to begin to narrow the gap , especially among African American youth .
For African American communities , integrating young women in science and technology begins with planting the seed at an early age , nurturing that seed to show the impossible is possible and , cultivating girls to become a part of those fields . Ever shifting , the formative and impressionable years between teen and young adult are a principal cause for why young girls are looking away from STEAM .
Ford remains committed to inspiring young people to seek knowledge , be curious , solve problems and—like Henry Ford himself—make their dreams of a better world come true .
Whether parent , educator , leader , STEAM alum , or just someone who cares about the village and its children , you can play a role in supporting an up-and-coming generation of young girls interested and desirous to pursue a career in STEAM .
Let 's unite as one to stimulate , inspire and change a life . At the end of the day , we 're all stakeholders in the future and success of our children .

[ READ MORE : Gov . Ivey declares state of emergency ahead of Tropical Storm Nate ]
The Hurricane Hunter aircraft found winds of 75 MPH in the center of Nate , making it a bona-fide hurricane . The category 1 hurricane is also producing wind gusts around 85 MPH .
Over the next 24 hours Nate will continue to develop over the warm waters of the Gulf as it deals with little shear to deter growth . This is pointing towards a situation where we could be in for a strong category 1 or even a weak category 2 hurricane once it 's all said and done . So we must remain weather aware !
We 'll continue to post updates as we keep a close eye on Nate . This is shaping up to be a potential high impact situation for Alabama where hundreds of thousands may be without power due to Nate 's damaging winds and potential tornadoes . Make sure you , you 're family , and friends are prepared BEFORE this storm arrives .
WEATHER ALERTS : Tropical Storm Watches and Warnings will be in effect for much of the state through the weekend as we deal with Nate . The now hurricane will threaten Alabama and areas along the Gulf Coast with damaging winds , heavy rain and isolated tornadoes . A hurricane warning is in effect for portions of the northern Gulf Coast from Louisiana to Alabama , and preparations to protect life and property should be underway .
Life-threatening storm surge flooding is likely along portions of the northern Gulf Coast , and a storm surge warning is now in effect from Morgan City , Louisiana , to the Okaloosa-Walton county line in Florida . Residents in these areas should heed any evacuation instructions given by local officials .
HERE 'S WHAT WE 'RE THINKING : Nate 's eye wall is gradually coming together and the First Alert Weather Team is keeping the door open for the possibility of a stronger system than what the latest N.H.C . update provides . With low wind shear along with very warm waters across the Gulf the possibility of Nate intensifying to a category 2 hurricane is there .
Yes the chance is slim but the latest update is painting a volatile weather situation for Alabama . We are likely in for sustained winds around 70 mph impacting southwest Alabama with gusts possibly as high as 90 mph . Tropical storm force winds will look to impact more eastern areas so that will include areas like Montgomery , Prattville , Troy , Alexander City , Selma and surrounding areas . Below you 'll find we have adjusted expected peak wind gusts for central and south Alabama . This will change based on the forecast track and intensity of Nate over the next 24 to 36 hours .
PREPARE AHEAD OF THE STORM : The time is not to make sure you are prepared for this high wind , rain , and possible isolated tornado event . With the threat of 70+ mph wind gusts for our area we will likely see scattered to numerous power outages especially over west and southwest Alabama . Scattered power outages can also be expected for central counties as well .
Make sure you have a reliable way to receive weather updates even if your power goes out . A NOAA Weather Radio is one such option . You can also download the WSFA First Alert Weather App for free for your mobile device . If you 're power goes out you 'll still have access to alerts from the National Weather Service , the WSFA First Alert Weather Team and you can stream our LIVE coverage of Nate all through your phone .
WHAT TO DO : Prepare for the possibility of power outages ; have candles , batteries , flashlights and any important medical supplies close at hand . Nonperishable food items and mechanical ( non-electric ) can openers could come in handy , too . Avoid driving Sunday morning if at all possible .
TIMING : Outer bands could bring some scattered rain and storms to the state Saturday afternoon , but the chief timeframe of concern is from midnight Saturday night through noon Sunday .
RAPID INTENSIFICATION ? The key question surrounding Nate is the intensity forecast . There are three scenarios . The most likely is that Nate gradually intensifies as it moves northward . But , there is also a small risk that Nate undergoes `` rapid intensification '' in the central Gulf of Mexico tomorrow . If that happens , the impact to our area will increase .
ALABAMA AND FLORIDA BEACHES : We anticipate storm surge flooding ( 4-8 ' ) , torrential rain , hurricane force wind and isolated tornadoes along the Alabama and Florida panhandle beaches . The weather will begin to go downhill quickly Saturday and will be very rough tomorrow afternoon through Sunday morning . Conditions at the beach will improve quickly Sunday afternoon , and the weather should be very nice along our Gulf Coast Monday and beyond .

“ From a medium term perspective , we believe market is right now stable and will consolidate between current level and 11,300 level . ( We ) do n't see too much of a fall from here . ”
Financials firmed up and accounted for most of the gains on the indexes , with HDFC Bank gaining 2 percent and Housing Development Finance Corp inching 0.9 percent higher .
However , shares of ICICI Bank Ltd , the country 's third-biggest lender by assets , dropped after it said it would institute an inquiry into allegations raised by an anonymous whistleblower against CEO Chanda Kochhar .
Among gainers , shares of Reliance Communications jumped 9.1 percent after the Anil Ambani-led company said on Wednesday it expects to complete its asset sale to Reliance Jio Infocomm and Canada 's Brookfield in coming weeks .

MIDDLESBROUGH manager Tony Pulis may want to achieve plenty more with his side come May , but January at least provided him with some much-needed clarity going forward .
The Boro boss was one of the busiest Championship chiefs on deadline day and the significant movement came with outgoings , with Martin Braithwaite , Cyrus Christie and Ashley Fletcher , bought in for a combined fee of around £18m , leaving for pastures new .
While having no axe to grind with any players wishing to leave , Pulis admits that he found it surprising that players brought in relatively recently professed a desire to go , although it has definitely marked his card for the future .
The no-nonsense Boro chief , whose side visit Norwich City today where he could hand debuts to Mo Besic and Jack Harrison following their arrivals , said : “ They ( players ) either want to play for Middlesbrough Football Club or they do not .
“ There is no middle line – you are either with it or not .
“ If they want to move and the opportunity is there to move – if it is a good deal for the football club , then fine .
“ I think it is important we set in stone what we are trying to achieve .
“ This is a fantastic football club with fantastic people . You want people to come here and grow , and people who are here for the right reasons .
“ If they come in , and after three or four months , and see it right and fit and want to leave , I find it astonishing , but I just want people who want to be at the football club .
“ I have got no problems with all the lads who have left , they are all good lads .
“ We have to find players with the character , understanding and commitment that will make them want to stay at this football club . ”

islamabad - The Capital Development Authority has found National Police Foundation housing scheme in violation of several by-laws governing the urban planning , The Nation has learnt reliably .
The Authority believed that the Foundation violated the approved layout plan of the NPF Housing scheme by changing the land use as residential plots in the scheme have been converted into commercial plots . A letter written by the directorate of housing societies to Director NPF , Islamabad in May 2018 enlisted a number of violations on part of the NPF administration . It said parks in the scheme have not been developed in the scheme area and a number of residential plots have been developed in the area in violation of the approved layout plan . Furthermore , public building sites and graveyard have not been developed in the scheme area , according to the letter . The directorate further stated that the Foundation has not yet submitted complete revenue papers for the scheme area as per land ownership and land developed by NPF housing scheme . The directorate has asked the NPF administration to dismantle any construction that took place in violation of CDA 's land use percentage for planning and development of housing scheme . They have also been directed to get the approval of building plans for all building from directorate of BCS-II , CDA . The directorate has asked the administration of the housing scheme to rectify the deficiencies in the land uses in the scheme area , graveyard , open spaces/parks and public buildings .
In March 2016 , the CDA alleged that National Police Foundation was involved in China cutting as it converted eight residential plots into commercial ones raising the number of residential plots from 1,195 to 1,232 at the cost of parks , playgrounds , open space and even graveyard , according to the documents available .
According to details , NPF had converted two residential plots into commercial ones to construct ground plus 7-storey ‘ Fortune Residency ' , converted six more residential plots into commercial ones to construct ground plus 3 to ground plus 4-storey commercial plazas . Fortune Residency was constructed on two residential plots bearing number 410 and 410-A in street number 26 of NPF in sector E-11/4 of the capital .
Six plots bearing number 690 , 692 , 693 , 694 , 695 and 696 in street number 43 were converted into commercial ones to construct plazas of G+3 to G+4-storey . As per the approved layout plan , total residential plots in the scheme were 1,195 whereas in accordance to ground position , these are 1,232 . Public buildings area and areas reserved for parks , playgrounds , open spaces and graveyard is far less than the area shown in the approved layout plan of the scheme . According to the letter written by the director housing societies CDA to the M/s NPF , the change in the approved layout plan is a sheer violation of rules/regulations .

Offensive lineman Trey Hill , the No . 27-ranked prospect in the class of 2018 , has decided to stay in his home state for college .
The nation 's No . 1-ranked offensive guard committed to Georgia over Auburn on Monday in a recruitment that trended toward the Tigers for much of the season until a late run by the Bulldogs .
The 6-foot-5 , 346-pound powerful interior run blocker also included Florida and Florida State among his finalists , but this was a battle between the two programs that battled during the regular season and in the SEC Championship Game having took multiple unofficial visits to both programs during the spring , summer and season .
The Bulldogs began gaining momentum during the season on the run to the SEC Championship along with when the nations top ranked prospect overall , Justin Fields , committed to Kirby Smart and staff October 6 .
Georgia , who will play Oklahoma in the College Football Playoff semifinal , boasted the No . 5 ranked recruiting class prior to Hill 's verbal . With Hill , the Bulldogs now have nine ESPN 300 pledges , with three coming after Fields announcement in running back James Cook , pass rusher Adam Anderson and Hill .
The win over Auburn for Hill means Smart and staff is one step closer to again doing the best job locking down the Peach State as been done in many years . After signing four of the top five ranked prospects in the 2017 class , and 11 of the top 20 , the Bulldogs are now set up to do the same in 2018 .
Georgia is the favorite for five-star defensive end and recent Ohio State decommitment Brenton Cox , No . 2 ranked offensive guard Jamaree Salyer and is a threat to flip in-state ESPN 300 linebacker and Michigan verbal Otis Reese . The Bulldogs are also trending to finis has the No . 1 ranked class with ESPN 300 prospects Cade Mays , tight end Luke Ford , Micah Parsons , one-time Tennessee verbal Alontae Taylor , Channing Tindall and five-star K.J . Henry still in play , along with Cox , Salyer and Reese .
Georgia signed the No . 3 class in February , and inked a top 10 class in nine of the 13 years ESPN has ranked prospects and recruiting classes . The Bulldogs have not signed back-to-back top 5 classes during that time span , which they will do in February .
EATON — The Gasper Township Fire Chief , Assistant Chief , and a third employee were terminated from their positions on Monday , May 21 , following claims of time card fraud , according to Gasper Township Trustee Eric White . White added , trustees voted to remove Fire Chief Tyler Claybaker , Assistant Chief Andrew Bekemeier , and EMT Justin Rike after receiving claims they were submitting and approving hours they did not work .
Tim Sean Halcomb , who was a captain with the department , was promoted to Interim Chief . According to Ex-Chief Claybaker , six individuals walked out of the department during the meeting . White stated , while many did walk out of the meeting , some came back as the meeting progress . Gasper Township lost a total of three fire department employees , White said .
He explained , “ Three employees were terminated due to time card fraud . On the EMT side , they are hourly employees and it just so happened , as far as the Fire Department getting drug into this , that Tyler Claybaker , Andrew Bekemeier , and Justin Rike , we let this three go .
“ The fraud was caught mostly from complaints made by those who had to stay after to cover for these employees . Unbeknownst to us , the time clock had stopped working , mysteriously . Basically , the time sheets that were turned in were all submitted on the computer and they got paid , it was n't a whole lot of money , but it was enough that it was wrong . ”
He added , Claybaker and Bekemeier are friends , while Rike saw those two committing what White considers time card theft and asked the chiefs to “ help him out . ”
It was originally reported , the department had a walkout following the decision and many were worried 24/7 EMS and fire coverage for Gasper Township would cease , but White said those accounts are exaggerated .
“ We had a few people walk out , but we are still up and running . They wish we had a walkout , basically . Another thing , it has almost been a recruiting tool . I kept getting complaints anyways . They did n't want employees talking to the trustees , but our levy does not pay for the full time EMS and Fire Department , so the trustees supplement out of the general fund , ” he said .
They reported the situation to Preble County Prosecutor Martin Votel , who attended the meeting on Monday . They went into executive session and when they came out , White made the motion to terminate employment of the three employees , Trustee Bill Roell voted in the affirmative , and Trustee Bill Hapner voted against the motion . The motion passed .
White added , “ Everything as far as staff looks like we are going to stay 24/7 , just like we have been . We are hardly ever out of service and I think we are going to be fine . ”
Claybaker tells a slightly different story . He said , “ I knew two or three months ago that my job was on the line . The interim chief right now was under investigation two or three months ago for harassment in the workplace . [ The trustees ] have been pretty hard to work with . I think the interim chief is going to try to compromise in that way , I know we tried several times . It is just one of those things where they have one point of view and we have another . We 're trying to evolve the fire department , but they want it to stay the same . It keeps going back and forth .
” From my point of view , what they 're calling time card fraud , there is no fraud there . I went from Eaton to Gasper , was clocked out at Eaton at six and clocked in at Gasper at six . They 're calling out the 15 minute difference between the two , but what they do not understand is I have a radio and pager in my vehicle and that is also the way I was taught .
“ I was never taught any different and there is not policy that says you have to be on the premises or in the building [ to clock in ] . I was going to show up on the call no matter what happened . They also went off other people 's words , them saying their time sheets are correct and they made it a one sided argument . ”
He added , the walkout was not due to the decision to fire him and the other two employees , but rather in protest of a long history of decisions made by the trustees .
“ I believe six walked out . The reason they left was because they could n't stand to work for the trustees any longer , because of what happened months prior , leading to this point . The now interim chief being under investigation and his punishment of a 15 day suspension ( with a 90 day probation ) . At that point , the employees began to wake up and realize that we ca n't do what they want us to , because our hands are tied by the trustees .
“ It is always two trustees against one . The other trustee was n't involved in anything . When the email went to Martin Votel about the current Interim Chief , the trustee did n't even know what was going on and had to call Mr. Votel to find out what was going on . He is the current President of the Board of Trustee , so that should n't happen . It is one point of view against another . One trustee leads them all , the other follows , and the last has no legroom to get a word in .
“ I think the decision was made several months ago to find a reason to terminate our employment . I do not believe this was an out of the blue thing , I believe this has been planned for awhile . ”

Golden Globe voters stuck with the tradition of shining the nominations spotlight on a clutch of buzzy new TV series .
Amazon 's “ The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel , ” Showtime 's “ SMILF , ” USA Network 's “ The Sinner , ” and NBC 's revival of “ Will & Grace ” all racked up key nominations that bolster their status as awards contenders .
The nominations haul for the 75th annual Golden Globe kudos was a good one for Netflix , which ranked No . 2 to HBO with nine bids , up from five in 2017 . HBO grabbed 12 bids , down from 14 , while FX claimed 8 noms , down from nine last year . NBC and Showtime both received five apiece , a gain for both nets ( compared to 3 in 2017 for NBC and 1 for Showtime ) .
HBO 's dozen was paced by “ Big Little Lies ” with six bids — no surprise given the star power in the limited series toplined by Reese Witherspoon and Nicole Kidman .
Globes voters spread the wealth among Netflix series “ The Crown , ” “ Master of None , ” “ Stranger Things , ” “ 13 Reasons Why , ” “ GLOW ” and “ Ozark . ”
Other under-the-radar nominees included the acting bid for Kevin Bacon for Amazon 's “ I Love Dick , ” Jason Bateman for “ Ozark , ” and Eric McCormack for “ Will & Grace . ”

Left off the list this time around was Amazon 's “ Transparent ” and “ Mozart in the Jungle , ” both shows that Globes voters were quick to embrace . “ Transparent ” star Jeffrey Tambor , who has been accused of sexual harassment by co-workers on the show , is also out of the running for lead comedy actor the first time in three years . He won the trophy in 2015 , the show 's first year of eligibility .
The comedy series field is almost entirely remade with only ABC 's “ Blackish ” returning as a repeat nominee from 2017 . HBO 's “ Veep ” is also out of the running for the first time since 2013 .
The drama series heat , on the other hand , was a rerun of 2017 with only “ Westworld ” dropping out ( the show is not eligible this year ) and Hulu 's “ The Handmaid 's Tale ” stepping in . The reigning Globes champ , “ The Crown , ” is back in the hunt along with HBO 's “ Game of Thrones , ” Netflix 's “ Stranger Things , ” and NBC 's “ This Is Us . ”
Among comedy series , “ Marvelous Mrs. Maisel , ” the just-launched period comedy from “ Gilmore Girls ” duo of Amy Sherman-Palladino and Dan Palladino , was recognized , as was star Rachel Brosnahan for lead comedy actress . “ Master of None ” landed a bid for its second season . “ SMILF ” grabbed a comedy series slot , and creator-star Frankie Shaw also got a nod for lead comedy actress .
“ Will & Grace ” rounds out the comedy series race . The show was a frequent nominee during its original 1998-2006 run but it never took home any Globes gold .
The limited series race sets up another starry faceoff between “ Big Little Lies ” and FX 's “ Feud : Bette and Joan. ” FX 's “ Fargo ” is also a contender along with the USA Network 's sleeper hit “ The Sinner ” and SundanceTV 's “ Top of the Lake : China Girl . ”
The noms for Witherspoon and Kidman for “ Big Little Lies ” and for “ Feud 's ” Susan Sarandon and Jessica Lange probably cost Moss the chance to be a double nominee for “ Top of the Lake ” as well as in the lead drama actress race . “ The Sinner ” star Jessica Biel made the cut in a tough field .
Just like Emmy voters , the Hollywood Foreign Press Association loved “ Big Little Lies ” so much they bestowed supporting noms on Shailene Woodley , Laura Dern , and Alexander Skarsgard .
All told , the major acting categories saw some significant shuffling compared to this year 's crop . Katherine Langford was a surprise pick for drama actress for Netflix 's “ 13 Reasons Why. ” She 's up against formidable competition from Claire Foy ( “ The Crown , ” this year 's winner ) , Moss ( “ Handmaid 's Tale ” ) , Caitriona Balfe ( “ Outlander ” ) , Maggie Gyllenhaal ( “ The Deuce ” ) .
Freddie Highmore elbowed his way into the drama actor field for his work in ABC 's promising new drama “ The Good Doctor. ” Bob Odenkirk ( “ Better Call Saul ” ) and Liev Schreiber ( “ Ray Donovan ” ) are repeat nominees . Sterling K. Brown of “ This Is Us ” and Bateman for “ Ozark ” joined the fray while this year 's winner , Billy Bob Thornton ( “ Goliath ” ) , fell out , as did Matthew Rhys ( “ The Americans ” ) and Rami Malek ( “ Mr . Robot ” ) .
Comedy-wise , Issa Rae of HBO 's “ Insecure ” was the only repeat nominee for lead comedy actress . “ Better Things ” star Pamela Adlon crashed the party for the show 's second season . Alison Brie joined Brosnahan and Shaw as a frosh nominee , for her work in Netflix 's “ GLOW . ”
“ Black-ish ” star Anthony Anderson was the only repeat nominee for lead comedy actor . William H. Macy ( “ Shameless ” ) and Aziz Ansari ( “ Master of None ” ) joined Bacon and McCormack in the funny-man field .

Kris Bryant and Anthony Rizzo each homer to help the Cubs past the Reds 15-5 in the first game of a four-game series at Wrigley Field . ( 0:51 )
CHICAGO -- His teammates wanted him to `` go for it , '' but that 's not Chicago Cubs outfielder Jon Jay 's style . After a single , double and triple in his first three at-bats against the Cincinnati Reds on Monday night , the team 's latest leadoff hitter truly was n't obsessing about hitting for the cycle .
That 's just not how he operates .
`` I was n't thinking about that , '' Jay said after the Cubs ' 15-5 win . `` I really do n't pay attention to it . I 'm not worried about that at all .
`` Everyone was [ saying ] , 'Take a shot , take a shot , ' because they know how I am . ''
In other words , they knew he would n't swing for the fences unless encouraged -- and maybe not even then . If Javier Baez has flair on the field , and John Lackey is a must-quote off of it , then Jay is the complete opposite in both respects . He plays the game with a quiet professionalism and hates talking about himself afterward . He was forced to on Monday , after a huge night that included an intentional walk that denied him another chance at that cycle , despite the game being out of reach at the time .
`` There was a base open , '' Jay said nonchalantly . `` They were just playing the game . ''

Jay does n't like talking about himself , but his teammates and manager recognize his contributions .
`` Great , great professional teammate , '' Anthony Rizzo said . `` Great person , works hard , sets an example for everyone in here . ... He grinds at-bats , has professional at-bats every single night . ''
Manager Joe Maddon added : `` He 's done a great job . Good at-bats . Hitting the ball hard , not just singles . ''
Rizzo and Kris Bryant had big nights , too , homering back to back , and Baez capped the scoring with an eighth-inning home run of his own . But it was Jay 's performance that could have the most important effect on the Cubs , because it might help end a search . Maddon has looked far and wide throughout his roster this year for a leadoff hitter to replace 2016 hero Dexter Fowler , and it took him well into the second half to land on Jay .
`` He wants to play , loves to play and he 's definitely stirred our drink , '' Maddon said .
Jay was n't the first choice , but he might be the best . Even before Monday , Maddon had indicated that Jay would be his guy at the top of the lineup if the postseason were beginning . He 's come a long way from just being the Cubs ' fourth outfielder .
`` I feel comfortable in every spot , '' Jay said . `` I 've hit first , ninth , eighth . I 've done it all . Just trying to be consistent . ''
Now , before you 're critical of Maddon for reaching this conclusion only after using a major league-high nine other leadoff men this year , consider that coming into Monday 's game , Jay was hitting only .231 with a .303 on-base percentage while batting first in the order . It has n't become a clear decision until lately . The good news ? Maddon does n't have to sit him against lefties , as his .391 on-base percentage against them this season plays just fine . He just has to stay consistent and get some rest every once in a while . And Jay has been every bit the leader the Cubs knew he would be when they signed him .
`` He 's done a lot of other things , talking to younger players , mentoring , '' Maddon said .
At least Jay can take that compliment : `` Just trying to be someone that when I go out there , they know what they can get , '' Jay said . `` It 's a good feeling when your teammates can count on you . ''
Now about that cycle .
With fans standing in the bottom of the eighth inning , after a long night , Jay strode to the plate . Here was his chance to make history , but he would have none of that `` go for it '' mentality . He flied out to center field . Afterward , it was suggested to him that a Baez-type swing might have been in order . No one on the Cubs swings harder .
`` That would have been a better plan right there , '' Jay said , nodding with some approval before returning to his team-first attitude . `` We got the win , so it 's cool . ''
After cruising through a perfect first set , the 23-year-old Gavrilova needed to save a set point in the competitive second set to hand the 13th-seeded Mladenovic her third straight loss .
`` She has a history of great comebacks . She has done it at the French Open almost every match , '' Gavrilova said after the match .
`` She stepped up her game and was playing a bit loser and was not making as many unforced errors because the first set was not a great set from her . ''
Gavrilova moves on to face Italian Camila Giorgi in the round of 32 on Tuesday .
Earlier in the day big-serving Czech Petra Kvitova battled back to defeat Anett Kontaveit 1-6 7-6 ( 2 ) 3-6 .
Kvitova , the tournament 's 14th seed and a two-time Wimbledon champion , will face either wildcard American Sloane Stephens or Czech Lucie Safarova , who will play at the Lindner Family Tennis Center on Tuesday .

Didier Hilhorst is a director of design at Uber . In this episode , he shares how his graduate degree in economics helped mold him as a designer and , in turn , shape how he and his team redesigned Uber from the ground up .
It 's not every day economics and design overlap with one another . But for Didier , they do . He explains how elements usually not thought of as a design tool , such as price , can be used as part of the product experience , not just an afterthought .
Starting a redesign from scratch with a product as large as Uber is no easy task . To help facilitate better communication between designers and engineers , Didier explains how Uber built an internal tool from scratch to help design at scale .

Last night 's clash between the Houston Outlaws and the Seoul Dynasty in the Overwatch League was dire for both teams . One was trying to keep a streak alive , another recovering from two straight losses , and both still posturing for a playoff berth .
Seoul has been in a rut after falling from undefeated to 5-2 , galaxy-braining themselves out of running team captain Ryujehong against the London Spitfire and falling 0-4 . Houston , on the other hand , was trying to keep a hot five-win streak alive despite a key player watching the match from home . Both needed this game to secure their playoff chances .
Ultimately Seoul came out on top , but the win was not easy . Houston forced the match to game 5 and the third point , the last possible round to play , despite star player Jiri “ LiNkzr ” Masalin still out on sick leave .
The story of the night was Fleta , Fleta , Fleta . Byung-Sun “ Fleta ” Kim put up highlight after highlight as Widowmaker , proving difficult for the Outlaws to deal with . He snapped to targets , landed headshots , and even picked heroes out of the air with deadly precision .

With LiNkzr out , it was time for Jake Lyon to step up for the Outlaws . And across five maps , he put up a fair performance . It was , as always , his Junkrat that truly impressed . In the right situation , Jake was able to pick apart Seoul with a booming barrage of explosives , splitting them up and forcing misplays .
But when push came to shove on the final point in the final map , it was Seoul who gave a little bit more . The Dynasty hero this time was not Fleta or even Ryujehong , who had a stellar return to the team after his mysterious absence against the Spitfire . It was Joon-Hyeok “ Zunba ” Kim , on a flex Zarya pick , that absolutely had the Outlaws ' number .

Seoul Dynasty manage to keep their playoff hopes secure , while the Outlaws are now in the rat race among other five-win teams like the Los Angeles Valiant and Philadelphia Fusion . Tonight 's matches will help establish a clearer playoff picture moving into the final week of stage 1 , and you can check those out starting at 2 p.m . ET on the Overwatch League Twitch channel .

“ The most powerful and ambitious Republican-led Congress in 20 years will convene Tuesday , with plans to leave its mark on virtually every facet of American life — refashioning the country 's social safety net , wiping out scores of labor and environmental regulations and unraveling some of the most significant policy prescriptions put forward by the Obama administration , ” the New York Times reports .
“ Even before President-elect Donald J. Trump is sworn in on Jan. 20 , giving their party full control of the government , Republicans plan quick action on several of their top priorities — most notably a measure to clear a path for the Affordable Care Act 's repeal . Perhaps the first thing that will happen in the new Congress is the push for deregulation . Also up early : filling a long-vacant Supreme Court seat , which is sure to set off a pitched showdown , and starting confirmation hearings for Mr. Trump 's cabinet nominees . ”

ISLAMABAD Opposing the historic merger of then Federally Administrated Tribal Areas into Khyber Pakhtunkhwa , Jamiat Ulema-e Islam-Fazl Chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman said that bill [ 31st constitutional amendment ] had been passed without alleviating concerns of the people of FATA .
Addressing a press conference here on Tuesday , the JUI-F chief said : “ No consultations were made with us pertaining to merger of [ then ] FATA into KP . The Prime Minister had assured us that [ then ] FATA would not be merged into KP . He ( PM ) had only informed us that jurisdiction of Supreme Court of Pakistan ( SC ) and Peshawar High Court ( PHC ) would be extended . ”
“ Frontier Crimes Regulations ( FCR ) has been revoked from tribal areas without implementing new laws . People are seeking reply from public representatives ” , Maulana Fazlur Rehman said . Now FATA would be without any mechanism for governance in the absence of FCR as there is not alternate system in place to attend the day-to-day matters of the residents of these areas .
“ They came to know after 70 years that Quaid-e-Azam made a wrong decision ” , he added . He said those who approved the FATA merger did n't know what they have lost . “ Such a decision will not benefit the country , ” he added .
The 31st Constitutional Amendment 2018 for merger of the Federally Administered Tribal Areas ( FATA ) into Khyber Pakhtunkhwa has been passed by National Assembly on Thursday .
As many as 229 members voted in the favour of the bill while 11 opposed it . The bill was approved clause by clause .
With the passing of the bill , KP laws will be immediately enforceable in FATA and it would also get Rs100 billion under NFC award for next 10 years .
Last week , Geoff Molson seemed to give many fans of the Montreal Canadiens the worst St. Patrick 's Day present ever . More of Marc Bergevin .
What exactly does this guy have to do to get fired ?
Bergevin , of course , has been on the hot seat after this garbage fire of a season . Developments this year have furthered the now-common view that Bergevin has made poor trades and overseen an organization weak in player development . Perhaps the most disconcerting aspect of his tenure is his fundamental failure to outline a clear organizational plan based on realistic goals and sensible performance measures .
Related : Rebuild the Montreal Canadiens
Instead , Bergevin has careened this team back and forth , to and fro . The Canadiens spent years getting fast and then tried to get tough overnight by trading for grit . After failing to re-sign key defensemen , trading or otherwise losing others , Bergevin famously announced the Habs ' obviously depleted defense corps was “ better ” than last year . Six years in , virtually no one will defend him or the decisions he has made .
No one , of course , except the one person who matters most . Mr. Molson is the owner and has apparently made his choice . Despite the outrage of fans , empty seats at the Bell Centre and a drop in TV ratings , Molson wants more Marc and beaucoup Bergevin . Fans can like it or lump it .
Geoff Molson says he 's confident that Marc Bergevin can get the Canadiens back on track . He also said he does n't anticipate changing management structure going into next season # TSN690 — Joey Alfieri ( @ joeyalfieri ) March 16 , 2018
It does beg the question , though : What exactly would Bergevin have to do to lose his job as general manager ? Here are five ways Bergevin could still be shown the door .
1 . Stop Dressing Like a Failed Bachelorette Contestant
First of all , I am loathe to question anyone 's fashion sense . But come on . Enough with the tight shirts , tailored suits , trendy eyeglasses and gelled tousled hair . Seriously .
Bergevin seems to be auditioning for a part on TV 's worst faux reality romance show , The Bachelorette . That is not a compliment . He is like the guy on the show that gets cut alongside five other losers in one of those mass dismissals . No rose for you ! You get the feeling his specially-fitted fashion-forward zoot suit would be the most memorable part of his walk of shame .
It is by design . When asked to describe his fashion sense during a photoshoot in an elegant Outremont residence , he stated :
I do get comments about the way I dress sometimes – even at the GM meetings the other day . One GM for an American team came over and said he went to the store to find a suit like mine . When he showed me the sport coat he found I told him I used to have material like that – but it was on the welcome mat in front of my door .
Good one , Marc . Just do n't be caught wearing a pair of Walmart sweatpants . You might be a disaster as GM but at least you are looking good , no ?
2 . Stop Making Deeply Weird Statements
As GM for the Montreal Canadiens , Bergevin is in the media a lot . He is always quick with a quote . They are usually pretty strange . They are often difficult to square with reality . Just a few :
Just before the Subban Trade :
When a GM calls me I do n't know who he 's calling me about so I answer the phone . Yes , I 've received calls on P.K. , but I 'm not shopping P.K . Subban . I can tell you that…Of course you never say never . If somebody offered me half of their team well you 've got to make it work , but it 's not my intention .
On the John Scott trade :
The timing , that was the timing to make the trade with John Scott . That has nothing to do with the Montreal Canadiens with the All-Star Game . I made a trade that at the time , I had to make that trade . I have a reason that I ca n't really tell you why , but if I could , you would probably understand .
On Jonathan Drouin at Center
In the perfect world , if we had this No . 1 center , this guy that could make plays , a high-end center – no , he 'd probably be on the wing . But he still does the best for now for what we have .
Those are deeply weird quotes . There are a lot of others . A GM that makes so many gaffes might worry some owners . In Montreal , this seems to be a strength . To keep his job , Bergevin will need to keep confusing the media in both of Canada 's official languages . Bet you ca n't wait for the end of year presser . I mean , what will he say next ?
3 . Reject Character as a Central Attribute
While some NHL teams are focusing on speed and skill , in Montreal , “ character ” is an attribute that seems to be important . Character , however , defies definition . It is one of those “ I know it when I see it ” kind of things . Bergevin wants to categorize “ character ” as if it is an objective measure , not some subjective notion .
Back in 2015 , Stu Cowan described it this way :
Bergevin has built a locker room in his own image , full of character and fun . And with his own confidence , the GM has n't been afraid to surround himself with top-notch people in hockey operations . The biggest improvement in the Canadiens since Bergevin took over has been pro scouting , which has identified character players like goalie Mike Condon , defencemen Jeff Petry and Tom Gilbert , and forwards Dale Weise , Tomas Fleischmann , Brian Flynn , Torrey Mitchell and Alexander Semin ( OK , nobody 's perfect ) .
That is a rare Cowan quote that has not aged well . Only one of those “ character ” guys is still with the team . Last year , as the Canadiens were gearing up for the playoffs , they acquired Dwight King , Andreas Martinsen , and Steve Ott . Character guys . The problem is that none of these players are still playing in the NHL . Oh well . If Bergevin starts focusing on skill , he will be out . I , for one , ca n't wait for a few more depth defenseman and bottom-nine wingers . Y'know , character guys .
4 . Failing to Acquire John Tavares
Geoff Molson wants John Tavares in Montreal . He wants him so badly that he skirted the NHL 's tampering rules which forbid any team not named the New York Islanders from making any sort of approach to Tavares until July 1 , 2018 . Overtures can not be made directly , through secret channels or through the media . In the past , it has resulted in fines .
It happened in Montreal last summer .
Of note this AM at # Habs golf tourney : G.Molson saying he and GM Bergevin hold discussions regarding star players , '' including ( John ) Tavares ' — Richard Labbé ( @ Richardlabbe ) September 11 , 2017
Tavares ( 27 ) is shaping up to be the most significant UFA in NHL history . He is likely to surpass Jonathan Toews and Patrick Kane 's $ 10.5-million cap hits and become hockey 's second-richest player behind Connor McDavid . The big question is whether Tavares will leave the Islanders . Is this the promise Bergevin whispered into Molson 's ear this winter ?
5 . Be Seen Drinking a Blue
If Bergevin 's numerous failings have not been enough to justify ending his tenure as GM , it is hard to see how dressing down , being more forthright with fans or acquiring skilled players would . Even failing to sign John Tavares , this summer 's prized UFA center , might be forgiven . However , there is one thing Mr. Molson could never forgive .
John Molson founded Canada 's oldest beer brewery on the banks of the St. Lawrence River in Montreal . In 1959 , Molson Canadian was first brewed , and today it is one of Canada 's best-selling brands . Beer is important to Geoff Molson . Perhaps the only way Bergevin could be fired is if Marc was seen swigging on a libation from Molson 's chief rival , Labatt .
C'mon Marc . Just a sip . See how it tastes .
Are humans too addicted to their smartphones ? I 'll leave the question hanging and point you to an art project in chat app form : Die With Me is a ( paid ) app that can only be used for chatting when your phone ( and your interlocutors ' phones ) are at 5 % or less battery left .
The app is an “ art project ” , says co-creator Dries Depoorter — the artist half of the team behind Die With Me , along with web dev , David Surprenant .
It 's possible the pair have inadvertently stumbled on the solution for tech addiction : Apps that only function within very specific and bounded windows .
Certainly configurable time windows in which specific apps can not be accessed would be a handy OS feature for managing device compulsion and dialing down of an evening .
But why a battery-bounded chat app ? How did they come up with the idea for Die With Me ?
“ I 'm an artist working with technology . Most of my work is about surveillance , social media and privacy , ” says Depoorter . “ I always try to come up with original ideas telling something about those themes ” — flagging , by way of “ perfect example ” , another of his works : A lottery ticket vending machine where you can win up to 25,000 fake followers for your Instagram and Twitter account .
He says he got lost in a city a few times after he could n't find his way back to his hotel because his phone had died . “ I think everyone with a smartphone landed in this sort of situation once . For me this was very inspiring , ” he adds .
“ As a digital artist I really wanted to do something with this feeling . For a long time I had the technique in my head of an app that you can only use when you have less than 5 % battery .
“ But I had no idea to make the app interesting . Later I came up the idea to make it a public chat room . ”
Why did they think the idea would resonant with smartphone users ? “ I think because apps like this do n't exist and I think it 's a new feeling we all can recognize , ” he says . “ Having a low battery on your feels .. It feels like you depended on technology . ”
After you 've paid $ 0.99 to download the iOS ( or Android ) app — a price-tag is necessary to fund server costs for the project — you have to wait until you 've got 5 % or less battery left before you are able to enter a nickname into the app and be ushered into its minimalist , ephemeral public chatroom .
At this point you 'll have an average of around four minutes ' chat time — depending on your device and battery — before your phone literally pulls the plug on the conversation . ( Or , well , I guess you could have a spare battery pack on standby and keep microdosing as the battery % dips to try to maintain the connection . )
Why did they settle on 5 % exactly ? “ We tried to find a balance so you can use the app but you also have stress to use it , ” says Depoorter . “ And we know for iPhone if you go less than 10 % it can die every moment . ”
“ Most of the time you end up with around 30 people in the chatroom , ” he adds . “ They go and new people get in . Sometimes it can take a while because for some phones the prediction of the % battery is not very good . We saw people sharing tips how to stay in for a long time . ”
If no one else happens to be in dire battery straits when you are , and you find yourself alone in the chatroom , you can scroll back through earlier messages — or leave a message for a future transient user to find .
Not all messages are going to be nice , clearly , given the anonymous transience involved — much like reading graffiti left on the inside of a public toilet door — and some reviews do complain of racist and sexist language being bandied about . Others say the app can be hilarious .
Depoorter says his favorite chat message so far is the entirely on message observation that : “ this app is like the life , new people come and go away and you forget them and when you 're gone you 're forgotten ” .
This is his favorite conversation :
– Malk ( 4 % ) : actually it 's a bit sad . I need my alarm clock in the morning . So when I die I have to wait for it to charge and turn on
– Pablo ( 3 % ) : dont forget !
– Malk ( 4 % ) : yup
– Pablo ( 3 % ) : i wont you to.lost your job tomorrow !
– Malk ( 4 % ) : i have none
So Is Die With Me going to live long ( and they hope prosper ) or is the idea for the art project to be ephemeral too — and the app wink out of existence in the not-at-all-distant future ?
No straight answer from Depoorter on that but he does say they 're “ working hard on a few exiting big updates ! ” , adding : “ We ca n't tell anything : ) But we ca n't wait to share the update ! ”
Presumably , given all the exclamation marks , he meant to type ‘ exciting ' not “ exiting ” . Albeit , either word almost works given the existential context .
The US Department of Commerce 's decision to impose sanctions on seven Pakistani entities reportedly related to our missile programme is a step in the wrong direction in the US-Pak relationship .
Even if one ignores the strategic ally aspect in this equation , the fact remains that all seven institutions – from the National Engineering and Scientific Commission ( NESCOM ) to the Air Weapons Complex ( AWC ) at Wah Cantonment and the Maritime Technology Complex ( MTC ) of Karachi – are research and development bodies related to science and technology , that would greatly benefit from their dealings with the US .
Pakistan already lags greatly behind the developed world in STEM ( Science , Technology , Engineering and Mathematics ) subjects , and this is an area it needs most help in .
This is not only about defence priorities or missile programmes ; throughout history , defence research has led to scientific advancements that benefit the average citizen as well .
But Pakistan can only move forward with innovation if it is at least at par with the rest of the world to begin with .
And that is not going to happen anytime soon .
As far as missile programmes are concerned , Pakistan has always attempted to keep up pace with the defence advancements of India , but fails to do so because of the lack of scientific knowledge .
Even those that are firmly fixated on the arms race should understand that more scientific knowledge is the only real way to compete on an equal footing .
While our neighbour and rival India is busy sending orbiting missions to Mars , Pakistan is still attempting to keep pace with the missile defence systems and other technological military advances of the eastern neighbour – sending a mission to space seems like a very distant dream .
The specific reason for the sanctions being imposed has not been given , but the government of Pakistan should investigate .
The controls were placed because reportedly , all seven entities were ‘ acting contrary ' to American national security and foreign policy interests , which should not be allowed to take place , considering the fact that Pakistan can not afford losing out on learning from the countries that do have expertise in all STEM subjects .
Breaking US or international law for both state-controlled or private research entities gives Pakistan the wrong sort of attention .
The government needs to investigate and avoid such problems in the future .
Islamabad - The Higher Education Commission has decided to introduce online system for degree verification .
In a notification issued here on Sunday , Higher Education Commission ( HEC ) Executive Director Dr Arshad Ali has directed that the degrees , certificates and diplomas will be verified only by the commission whereby the universities will not be authorised to do so .
The purpose of the new system is to ease the matters regarding verification of degrees .
According to the current system of HEC , the degrees are being verified from the Karachi , Quetta and Lahore regional offices whereas it will soon be made online all across the country .
Students will upload their degrees after scanning it through HEC 's online system which will be linked to National Database and Regulation Authority ( NADRA ) .
In the first step , the student 's identity will be verified .
The commission is also making a Pakistan qualification register where the degree programme details of all government and private universities will be present .
However , a student 's degree will fail to get verified if the details of his degree programme are not in the register .
Moreover , HEC will also give access of the database to the controller examination of all universities so that the scanned degree is also checked by them .
ISLAMABAD - Pakistan on Sunday said that India was trying to hide its own terror network by hurling allegations at Pakistan for allegedly promoting terrorism .
Foreign Office spokesperson Nafees Zakaria said that the UN had rejected India 's politically motivated proposal to impose sanctions on Pakistan .
He said that the UN Security Council 's 1267 Sanctions Committee dismissed India 's baseless plea - related to Islamic State , Al-Qaeda , Jaish-e-Mohammed , Lashkar-e-Tayyaba and others .
Commenting on reports about the failure of Indian move in the UN Security Council 's 1267 Sanctions Committee , Zakaria said India 's allegations lacked substance .
He reiterated Pakistan 's commitment to continue close cooperation with the international community in its collective endeavours for elimination of terrorism .
Earlier , India moved the UN seeking “ international action ” against “ Pakistan-based ” LeT , JeM and their “ shadowy supporters ” . Pakistan denies any terror group is allowed by the government to operate .
The nation is also engaged in a fierce battle to eliminate the menace .
India 's Permanent Representative to the UN Syed Akbaruddin said at the UN Security Council that Pakistan must be stopped from “ supporting ” the terror groups .
But China blocked India 's attempts to pressurise the UN to impose sanctions on Pakistan .
India alleged JeM chief was behind the Pathankot attack that killed several Indian soldiers . They had also blamed Jamaatud Dawa chief Hafiz Mohammed Saeed of orchestrating the 2008 Mumbai attacks .
India is also misguiding Afghanistan that “ Pakistan-based ” militants were behind the unrest in their country .
Last month , at the Heart of Asia Conference in Amritsar , India had Afghanistan targeted Pakistan for allegedly “ supporting ” the militants to carry strikes in India and Afghanistan .
This came amid Pakistan 's calls to revive the dialogue process with India and support the international efforts for peace in Afghanistan .
Pakistan also held a meeting with Russia and China to discuss Afghan peace in Moscow last month and has invited Kabul to become part of the process .
In a statement , Foreign Office spokesman Nafees Zakaria said Pakistan had made significant contribution and rendered enormous sacrifices in success of the international community 's efforts against terrorism .
He said that “ replete with frivolous information and baseless allegations ” the Indian proposal had no merit and was aimed at advancing its narrow national agenda .
Zakaria said that India had deployed terrorism as an instrument of state policy , and had itself been involved in perpetrating , sponsoring , supporting and financing terrorism .
He said that Pakistan had been a direct victim of India 's state-sponsored terrorism and confessions of Research and Analysis Wing ( RAW ) 's agent Kulbhushan Jadhav about his involvement in terrorist activities in Pakistan “ proved this fact . ”
The spokesman said that more evidence of India 's involvement in terrorism inside Pakistan would also be shared with the United Nations and the international community . He said that it was clear that India 's “ unfounded allegations against Pakistan are in fact aimed at masking its own terrorist activities in Pakistan . ”
Last day , Pakistan finalised its dossier against India 's interference and Yadav 's confessions for carrying terrorist activities in Pakistan .
Pakistan 's permanent representative to the UN Maleeha Lodhi will present the case to the new UN chief Antonio Guterres this month .
India again seeks access
to Kulbhushan
Monitoring Desk adds : Renewing its demand , India on Sunday asked Pakistan for consular access to Kulbhushan Jadhav , arrested on charges of espionage , reported Indian media .
The External Affairs Ministry said India remains committed to address on `` priority '' with Pakistan the humanitarian matters , including those pertaining to prisoners and fishermen in each other 's country . `` In this context , we await from Pakistan confirmation of nationality of those in India 's custody who are otherwise eligible for release and repatriation .
`` We also await consular access to those Indian nationals in Pakistan 's custody for whom it has so far not been provided including Hamid Nehal Ansari and Kulbhushan Jadhav , '' the ministry said in a statement .

Paul Goldschmidt 's first National League Player of the Month Award came hard on the heels of one of the worst slumps of his career . While the Arizona Diamondbacks slugger led all qualified NL hitters in batting average , runs scored , home runs and extra-base hits in the month of June , that was immediately after he struggled terribly to simply get on base in the month of May .
During his first 20 games in May , Goldschmidt went 7-for-73 , seeing his batting average drop all the way to .198 . He finished the month with some of the worst monthly stats of his seven-year career , including a .144 batting average and .531 OPS ( on-base plus slugging ) .

`` First of all , in May I just did n't play well , '' he said . `` That whole month , I was trying to find what adjustments I could make , looking at video , in the cage , with our coaches here . It really did n't work . It was n't like June 1 came , and all of a sudden a light bulb went off or anything .
`` I was trying to take good swings , but I do n't think I was really getting in that great of a position to hit . I was trying to look at video . I was trying to get in the cage . I was trying to do drills . It was n't really happening . And then maybe at the end of that month , I felt like I was kind of moving in a good direction . ''
According to D-backs hitting coach Dave Magadan , Goldschmidt did have to make some minor mechanical adjustments . But the core of the work had to do with combining those adjustments with being selective at the plate .
`` There were some small mechanical things that he was working on that he started falling into last year . He came out of the spring swinging the bat OK , but not what we 've come to expect out of Paul . So it was just a matter of cleaning that stuff up , '' Magadan said . `` When you 're trying to make some changes , whether they 're significant or small , there is that period of time when you 're kind of thinking about it in the game probably more than you should . There was probably a period of time where he was probably thinking a little bit about the mechanical issues , and then it was splitting his focus in the game where he was probably swinging at pitches that he normally does n't swing at . That kind of snowballed and is part of a reason why he was going through that bad period . So it was a combination of the two : the mechanical issues along with pitch selection . ''
But it was n't exactly an easy fix . Goldschmidt continued to struggle in May , especially against fastballs coming in at 95 mph or faster . This translated to pitchers attacking him with their hardest heat .
`` When I was struggling in May , some people brought up that I was n't hitting fastballs in that velocity that well . But for me , I just felt like I was n't really hitting anything , '' Goldschmidt said .
Just three other hitters saw as many fastballs thrown that hard through the first two months of the 2018 season : Aaron Judge , Mike Trout and Matt Olson . Goldschmidt not only struggled to make contact with hard heat , but he also could n't hit it for power , despite having registered a .790 OPS against fastballs clocked at 95-plus before this year . Goldschmidt 's roller coaster at bat Month AVG/OBP/SLG K rate May .144/.252/.278 31.5 % June 1-July 3 .390/.482/.780 19.4 %
`` I am not someone that looks at the numbers , [ but ] I was like , all right , let me check out what I did in previous years because I knew I was a little off , '' Goldschmidt said . `` I looked to see if in previous years I was struggling , especially last year or the last two years . If I was struggling on fastballs or fastball over 95 or whatever it is , and I was doing it again this year , then I would feel like maybe there 's a bigger change you could make . But I feel like in the past years , I did well on fastballs over 95 . Then if I can get back to where my swing was and get back to my timing , then it would take care of itself . At least last year , I know I hit fastballs really well .
`` We 're not computers . You 're human , '' he added . `` So for whatever reason , you 're going to be off . For me , it 's about simplifying it -- trying to have a simple swing , not a lot of movement , not a big leg kick . Let 's stay simple . Let 's stick with the same stuff I was doing when I was doing well . ''
A rival 's executive described Goldschmidt 's struggles in May as `` unusual '' and emphatically stated that they `` would not last . '' Any suggestion that the now 30-year-old could be slowing down in his swing or reflexes was met by a skeptical , `` One can hope so , but it 's unlikely . ''

With the myriad injuries the Diamondbacks endured early this season , it was also Goldschmidt 's burden to carry the lineup while enduring one of the worst slumps of his career . As evidenced by Arizona 's current 1.5-game lead on the Dodgers ( with the Giants not much further back ) , the more he succeeds , the better the D-backs will be .
`` It 's very easy to put things on paper , but it 's really just about the experience of facing pitchers and dealing with failure , '' Goldschmidt said . `` Even my start to this year , using that as a learning experience and dealing with that failure and maybe learning something new about my swing or the way they 're attacking me , even though that month statistically was one of my worst . You can learn from that and be a better ballplayer from it . ''
It 's precisely that uncanny ability to turn his `` May Day '' slump into a teaching moment that is one of the reasons Magadan believes Goldschmidt will continue to be one of the game 's elite hitters .
`` He 's willing to put in the work . He knows his swing . He can make in-game adjustments like nobody I 've ever seen , '' Magadan said . `` And those are the elite hitters , the elite hitters that can get immediate feedback off a pitch or swing and then make the adjustment . That 's a big part why Goldy is so good . ''

Clinton Township — Thomas Kithier sat with his parents in the Chippewa Valley Schools Administration Building Monday night , listening to people speak on his behalf to try to persuade the school board to OK his transfer from Macomb Dakota High to Clarkston High so he could continue his basketball career .
Kithier , a 6-foot-8 senior power forward and Michigan State commit , transferred to Clarkston for his senior year , but was banned from competing by the MHSAA with Dakota administrators claiming his move was athletically motivated . The MHSAA agreed with Dakota 's assessment and ruled Kithier ineligible .
“ I want everyone to understand that this is an academic transfer and I 'm insulted that Chippewa Valley thinks otherwise , ” said Jane Kithier , Thomas ' mother , a health and physical education teacher at Grosse Pointe North . “ I am a teacher and education is very important . Dakota High School did not provide the classes he needed , it 's as simple as that , one being a math class , the other being a media production class , which is important because he 's considering majoring in communications with sports journalism being considered .
“ ( Dakota ) has let other students transfer , and they let several football players go , so why are n't they letting Thomas transfer ? ”
Added Karl Kithier , Thomas ' father : “ This is a situation that an 18-year-old high school kid should not be in . We 're very proud of him , very supportive of him . This is a very tight family unit , but this is unfair to him . They 're ( MHSAA ) using him as a pawn . If there 's a transfer rule that 's broken , fix it , do n't use a kid as a test piece . It 's not right and it 's not fair . ”
Chippewa Valley Superintendent Ron Roberts opened the meeting with a statement regarding the Kithier case . Dakota and the Chippewa Valley district have come under heavy criticism in recent days since the decision against Kithier was announced by the MHSAA .
“ This summer we were asked to sign a transfer agreement for Thomas to Clarkston High School , ” Roberts said . “ There was a lot of proof that made it clear to us that the transfer is what the MHSAA considers athletically motivated . The transfer agreement from the MHSAA requested our administrators to sign a document and attest to statements that our administrators believed were not true . We discussed the issue and agreed that signing off on the document would put us in unenviable and unacceptable position of lying to the MHSAA . We made the MHSAA aware of our reason for not signing the document and let them know of our concerns . It appeared clear to us that the circumstances behind the transfer were a direct violation of MHSAA rules . That is where Chippewa Valley 's involvement in the process ended . ”
Roberts said Dakota is not considering reversing its decision .
Jane Kithier insists that her son 's decision to transfer was motivated by academics , not athletics .
“ At no point ( Monday ) did ( Roberts ) really talk about Thomas and the academic reasons that he did transfer , ” Jane said . “ The piece that frustrates me the most is that people are not talking about the academic stuff here . They refuse to acknowledge it . He refused to acknowledge it . ”
Thomas said he plans to stay at Clarkston regardless of his playing status .
“ I 'm just going to stay positive through the whole situation , ” Thomas said after the meeting was over . “ In life things wo n't go your way , but you just have to wake up every morning with a smile on your face and just know that God will have my back . I 'm just happy with who I am and thankful I have supporting parents .
“ I just did n't feel comfortable at Dakota . Things just changed over the years for me at Dakota and academically and socially it just was n't a good fit for me .
“ Clarkston is great , academics and socially . I have a lot of friends at the school , great teachers , great principal , great vice-principal , my counselor is great . It 's an amazing community that has welcomed me and I feel like it 's that for every student . If you play sports , if you do n't play sports , they treat every student the same and I feel it 's a welcoming school for me . ”

SACRAMENTO , Calif. — Sacramento Kings rookie Harry Giles will not play until at least January while he rehabs his surgically repaired knees .
Giles is the 20th overall draft pick out of Duke . He missed summer league to rest his left knee . The team said Friday he will work with the training staff to build strength and endurance . He will participate in some `` controlled '' parts of practice .
Giles had an arthroscopic procedure on his left knee last October after a ligament tear during high school in 2013 . He also tore a ligament in his right knee in 2015 .
The Kings say they are taking a `` methodical approach '' and Giles will be `` reevaluated routinely throughout the program . ''
Dear Dr. Roach : My husband has been diagnosed with a rectal fissure . It has been a couple of months , and it is n't any better . He has been treated only with a stool softener . What do you suggest ?
A.T.S .
Dear A.T.S . : Anal fissures are painful . Although a stool softener is one part of management for people who have constipation , additional treatments also are appropriate , including a sitz bath , which is just a few inches of warm water in a basin or tub that you soak your bottom in . When I was an intern , I wondered about the origin of the term “ sitz bath. ” My resident , Dr. Lynn Brown , told me that it 's because you “ sitz ” in them , and it turns out she was right : It 's from the German “ sitzen , ” meaning “ to sit . ”
Other treatments include increased fiber and a topical painkiller ( there are many over-the-counter preparations in ointment form ) . These treatments help heal the fissure by relieving anal spasms caused by a painful bowel movement . I 'm afraid your husband has n't had adequate treatment , leading to a vicious cycle of pain , spasm and nonhealing .
In addition to these treatments , fissures heal more quickly with a medication to increase blood flow to the area : Nitroglycerin is available as a prescription ointment , and nifedipine can be compounded for topical use by a pharmacist , with better healing and fewer side effects than nitroglycerin ( but both of these work better than no treatment ) . If this is n't effective after a month , he should be re-evaluated . There are other options available before considering surgical treatment . A gastroenterologist is a good resource if his primary doctor has n't been successful .
One other concern is that occasionally anal fissures are a sign of Crohn 's disease , a serious inflammatory bowel disease . People with recurrent , atypical ( not in the midline ) or nonhealing fissures should be evaluated for Crohn 's disease .
Dear Dr. Roach : You recently wrote about exercise causing rhabdomyolysis , and I have a question about that . My 92-year-old mother-in-law fell , and was n't sure how long she laid there , but the doctors said she had no broken bones . However , she did develop rhabdomyolysis . Since she does not exercise , how did she acquire this condition ? The only medication she is on is one for blood pressure .
G.M .
Dear G.M . : Rhabdomyolysis is a very serious condition of muscle breakdown . The most common because I have seen is your mother-in-law 's : pressure on muscle in someone who is unconscious or unable to move for a prolonged period ( in normal sleep , the body changes position frequently , which prevents this ) . However , it can happen in untrained people after heavy workouts , or even in trained athletes who do extreme workouts , especially in hot and humid conditions . Some medications rarely can cause it , such as colchicine or statin drugs . Rhabdomyolysis is treated conservatively , by removing the underlying cause , and trying to prevent damage to the kidney .
For elderly or frail people who live alone , I recommend a device that can be easily carried and pressed to get help . Some of these can recognize a fall and will send a signal automatically . Falls are common in the elderly , and these devices can help prevent some of the serious consequences of falling .

Non-issuance of visas to Zaireen
Sophia Siddiqui
Islamabad
Pakistan has expressed deep disappointment over the non-issuance of visas by India for the visit of the 503 Pakistani Zaireen to participate in the Urs of Hazrat Khawaja MoinuddinChishti ( RA ) at Ajmer Sharif , India from 19-29 of this month .
“ As a result of this Indian decision , the Pakistani Zaireen have been deprived of the opportunity to participate in the Urs , which is of special significance , said foreign office Spokesperson Dr Muhammad Faisal in a statement on Monday .
He said the visit was to take place under the 1974 Pakistan-India Protocol on Visits to Religious Shrines and is a regular annual feature .
The spokesperson said earlier , 192 Pakistani Zaireen could not participate in the Urs of Hazrat Khawaja NizamuddinAulia ( RA ) in Delhi from 1-8 January 2018 , due to the non-issuance of visas by India .
The spokesperson said during 2017 , despite Pakistan 's offer to send a special train , Indian delays had resulted in Sikh yatrees from India being unable to participate in the Martyrdom Anniversary of Guru ArjanDev and the death anniversary of Maharaja Ranjit Singh .
Dr Muhammad Faisal said similarly , in February 2018 , the Government of Pakistan had made all the arrangements for the visit of 173 Katas Raj Pilgrims , who , regrettably , were forced to withdraw their applications from the Pakistan High Commission in New Delhi due to non-issuance of necessary clearance by the Ministry of External Affairs of India .
He said besides being violative of the bilateral Protocol of 1974 and the basic human right to religious freedom , such measures also undermines the efforts aimed at improving the environment , increasing people-to-people contacts and normalizing relations between the two countries .
The foreign office spokesperson said it is again ironic that this was done on the occasion of Urs of Hazrat Khawaja MoinuddinChishti ( RA ) who has for centuries been the symbol of bringing communities closer to each other .
LONDON - Barclays plans to close around 54 branches by the end of the year in an effort to cut costs , further reducing access to banking services for customers in parts of Britain .
The bank , along with other British lenders , is cutting back its network as customers turn to mobile banking . Barclays , which told customers about the planned closures in recent weeks still has around 1,300 branches across the country .
The number of branches operated by the major British banking groups has halved in the last 20 years and following political pressure a new rule was set in 2015 that requires banks to assess the impact on local communities of a branch closure .
Branch closures in Britain are disproportionately affecting lowest-income areas , taking bricks-and-mortar services away from communities where they are needed most , Reuters reported in June last year .
`` The number of physical Barclays branches will reduce overall but our branch network and the colleagues who work in them remain a vital part of our offering , '' a Barclays spokeswoman told Reuters in an email . The Barclays branch closures should not result in any net job losses , she said , with jobs set to be transferred elsewhere .
The latest round of bank branch closures , which are targeted at reducing costs , have raised concerns among small businesses as well as individuals in Britain . `` At a time of unprecedented uncertainty , the last thing small businesses need is ( the ) loss of in-person bank branch support , '' Mike Cherry , Federation of Small Businesses ( FSB ) National Chairman , said . `` When times are tough , there 's no replacement for help from a known and trusted bank branch contact . ''
RBS said in March it planned to close about 180 branches in Britain and Ireland and about 1,000 roles were at risk at the state-controlled lender .
And in April , Lloyds Banking Group ( LLOY.L ) said it planned to close a further 100 branches of its more than 2,000 in the UK resulting in the loss of over 325 jobs .
HSBC ( HSBA.L ) said in January it planned to close 117 branches this year and cut 380 roles in Britain .
In March , Barclays also decided to close a mortgage centre in Cardiff , Wales , with the loss of more than 180 jobs .
Horgan has spoken with both Trudeau and Notley in recent days to reiterate his government 's position
B.C . 's premier says his government is trying to protect the province , not be provocative , over a proposed ban on an increase of diluted bitumen shipped from the west coast .
John Horgan said Friday that his government 's announcement earlier this week is cautionary and designed to make sure B.C . does n't suffer in the event of a catastrophic spill .
“ I did not set out to be provocative , ” he said at a news conference . ” In fact , I would suggest that a press release saying we 're going to have a consultation should not be the foundation of a trade war between good friends . ”
Alberta Premier Rachel Notley suspended talks Thursday on buying B.C . electricity , and has described the proposal as an unconstitutional attempt to stop Kinder Morgan 's Trans Mountain pipeline .
The expansion project would triple capacity along the pipeline between Edmonton and Burnaby , B.C. , and increase tanker traffic off the coast seven-fold .

READ MORE : ‘ That pipeline is going to get built : ' Trudeau dismisses B.C . 's Trans Mountain move
Ottawa has already approved the expansion and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau promised again on Friday that Trans Mountain will go ahead , saying it 's an important part of Canada 's energy plans .
Horgan said he 's spoken with both Trudeau and Notley in recent days to reiterate his government 's position that expanding the pipeline would pose a significant threat to B.C . 's economy and environment .
The province is already challenging the project in Federal Court , arguing that B.C . was not adequately consulted .
The government has sought legal advice on the new proposed regulations , but that advice is confidential , Horgan said .
Talking to residents is well within the province 's rights , he added .
“ We are not putting in place regulations today , we are not putting in regulations at the end of the month . We are putting in place a consultation and an intentions paper so that the public has an understanding of the potential impact of a catastrophic spill within British Columbia . ”
B.C . is not trying to take on the rest of the country with the proposed rules , Horgan said , but does want to be an equal partner in the federation .
He noted that there are many other issues where he agrees with Notley and Trudeau , and hopes they can move forward on those .
“ I think there 's great potential for positive working relationships on a number of fronts and I prefer to focus on those , ” he said .

“ Brigada Costa del Sol ” marks what looks like an early direct involvement of Warner Bros. in primetime fiction drama series production in Spain . Though Warner Bros. has been linked to Spanish TV fiction production in the past via Eyeworks ( “ Hermanos y detectives ” ) , it is best known for its distribution and sometimes co-production of top Spanish movies , where historically , until very recently , it has ranked as the most active of Hollywood studios .
Operating in Spain for more than 15 years , WB ITVP España has mainly focused on producing non-scripted content for top free-to-air TV operators , with recent shows such as “ First Dates ” and “ Who Wants to Marry My Son , ” both for Mediaset España 's Cuatro , and “ Kitchen Nightmares ” for Atresmedia 's LaSexta .
WB ITVP also explored the local pay TV market in 2016 , teaming with Telefonica 's Movistar + to produce contest “ A cappella ” for channel # 0 .
Netflix produced in 2016 its first original series in Spain , “ The Cable Girls , ” teaming with Bambú Producciones , and has partnered with Zeta Audiovisual for its second , teen mystery drama “ Elite , ” still to be launched .
It has also agreed with Vancouver Media and Atresmedia to produce a new season of SVOD TV global phenomenon “ La Casa de Papel ” ( “ Money Heist ” ) and has co-financed RTVE 's cult series “ The Department of Time ” and Atresmedia 's “ La Catedral del Mar , ” which debuted May 23 with a standout 22.8 % audience share for in Antena 3 .
As the current heatwave continues to bring warm weather and bright skies , it also brings a surge in the demand for water .
However , Yorkshire Water has recently revealed that daily water consumption has increased by up to an extra 200 million litres , this being more water than the whole of Leeds consumes in one day .
Yorkshire Water advise customers to not water established plants and lawns
The firm has enacted its contingency plans and increased water production capacity in order to meet the anticipated spike in water use as the warm weather continues .
When temperatures surged last weekend , the firm 's daily supply exceeded 1.5 billion litres and although they have reported that reservoir levels in the region are nearly three-quarters full and there are no current water supply shortages , they are urging people to carry out water-saving tips .
With no rainfall expected this week , the firm is encouraging its five million customers to use water more wisely in order to help ensure that the huge demand can continue to be met .
The firm are also asking customers to report any leaks and cracked or burst pipes in their local areas in order to prevent water being wasted .
A garden hose can use more water in an hour than a family normally uses in two days
Director of Service Delivery at Yorkshire Water , Pamela Doherty , said : “ Despite there being no current water shortages , water is a precious resource and we would still encourage everyone to do their bit to help by using water a little more efficiently .
“ Our top tips are to limit time spent in the shower to no more than four-minutes , use a watering can to water garden plants , and to hold off on cleaning the car but if you have to wash it use just use a bucket and sponge . ”
Yorkshire Water 's top water-saving tips include :
1.Having a shower instead of a bath and trying to limit yourself to four minutes . You can even time yourself by ordering one of their sand timer plastic hourglasses .
2 . Do n't wash your car . You can get away with washing just the windows , lights and mirrors or if do you have to wash it just use a bucket and sponge and not a hosepipe .
3 . Not watering established plants and lawns as a garden hose can use more water in an hour than a family normally uses in two days .
4 . Water new plants and lawns with a watering can and do so as late in the evening as possible so that the heat does n't make the water evaporate .
5 . Cover any paddling pools and hot tubs when not in use so that the water needs changing less often . Instead of emptying and totally refilling it every time , use a fish tank net to clean out the paddling pool instead .
6 . Fix any leaking taps as this can save up to 5,500 litres of water over the course of a year .
7 . Keep a bottle of tap water in the fridge for drinking so you do n't need to run the tap until it gets cold enough to drink .
8 . Set your mower a level higher during summer as keeping grass longer shades the soil surface and reduces water lost to evaporation .
9 . Make sure your white goods , including dishwashers and washing machines , are full before being switched on . This not only saves water , but it is also more energy efficient and will help to save money on electricity bills .
Yorkshire Water are also encouraging customers to order a free water-saving pack , which contains a four-minute shower timer , save-a-flush toilet cistern bag , tap inserts and a shower regulator .

LAS VEGAS ( KLAS ) — One way people are honoring the lives lost in the shooting at the Route 91 music festival is by opening up their wallets .
MGM Resorts already donated a whopping $ 3 million to the victims and their families , and Sheldon Adelson and the Las Vegas Sands Corporation donated $ 4 million .
Zappo 's , the UFC , and Station Casinos have all pledged $ 1 million each .
Many individuals are also donating what they can , including more than $ 9 million raised in a GoFundMe campaign started by Clark County Commissioner Steve Sisolak and Sheriff Joe Lombardo .
But exactly how will the money be put into the hands of those who need it ?
The LasVegasNow.com I-Team tried to find out .
The outpouring of generosity has been inspirational and astounding . The GoFundMe effort is perhaps the best example of that .
As of Thursday evening , that fund stood at $ 9.5 million raised in just a few days from 77,000 donations . So , how will the money be spent , and who will administer the funds ?
“ We set up a GoFundMe account because the sheriff and I thought that we could maybe help some of these victims with funeral expenses , with travel expenses , ” Sisolak said .
Commissioner Sisolak 's idea to team up with Sheriff Joe Lombardo in starting a fund to help to shoot victims quickly exceeded expectations .
It is not clear how the millions of dollars in the fund will be dispersed . At Wednesday 's county commission meeting , the discussion focused on whether a third party such as the National Center for Victims of Crime could be brought in to handle the administrative duties . Those duties include getting the money into the hands of those who need it most by paying for ongoing medical treatments , travel expenses for the wounded and funeral expenses for those who died .
On Thursday , the I-Team learned another potential partner surfaced . Discussions were held behind the scenes between Commissioner Sisolak 's staff and individuals with experience in administering funds raised in the wake of a tragedy . In particular , the Boston Marathon bombings of 2013 . Three people were killed and hundreds were injured . Donations exceeded $ 60 million .
Boston 's experience could serve as a model . However , no agreement has been reached .
“ We are in the process now of deciding strategy and structure , how to give out the money . We had people today who flew in to meet with county staff to try and coordinate this . The sheriff and I are not involved with this . We started it , but that 's the extent of what we plan to do , ” Sisolak said .
It is not known how and to whom the Las Vegas money would be distributed , but a large chunk of the donated money will stay with GoFundMe , the company which hosts the fundraising webpage .
GoFundMe charges a standard 7.9 percent of all the money raised plus a fee of 30 cents per donation . As of thursday evening , 77,000 individual donations have been made from 75 countries around the world .
That means the total fee charged by GoFundMe for hosting the Las Vegas page could exceed $ 776,000 dollars .
Whether GoFundMe can be talked into cutting some slack on its fees is unknown .
Commissioner Sisolak said that in addition to a group from Boston , county staff also met with groups who managed similar funds following tragedies in New York and Orlando . Whoever administers the Las Vegas fund must agree to allow for local control in vetting which people qualify to receive some of the money .
Nigeria Loses Up to $ 100 Billion in Revenue as Attacks Cut Oil
Nigeria said it lost out on as much as $ 100 billion in revenue last year as attacks by militants in the oil-rich Niger Delta cut crude output to a record low .
Production fell by 1 million barrels a day to 1.2 million a day at the peak of the attacks , Emmanuel Kachikwu , minister of state for petroleum , said Tuesday in a video-clip on his Facebook page .
Last year , Nigeria suffered its first full-year recession since 1991 as a resurgence of armed conflict in the delta , combined with lower oil prices , blighted the economy .
While recent peace efforts have curbed the frequency of attacks on oil infrastructure , the West African nation has struggled to boost output as one of its largest export terminals remains closed .
“ We continue to engage , ” Kachikwu said , referring to peace talks between the government and local leaders from the delta . “ It is a difficult undertaking to try to embark on trying to resolve it once and for all , but we 're very bullish about this . ”

Ronny Jackson 's VA Nomination Hearing In Jeopardy Amid 'Serious Allegations '
Enlarge this image toggle caption Alex Brandon/AP Alex Brandon/AP
Adm. Ronny Jackson 's nomination to become secretary of veterans affairs appears to be in limbo amid what one key lawmaker tells NPR 's Morning Edition are `` serious '' but `` unsubstantiated allegations . ''
The comments by Sen. Mike Rounds , R-S.D. , come a day before Jackson 's planned nomination hearing before the Senate Committee on Veterans Affairs . It was not clear if the hearing would go ahead as scheduled .
The senator declined to comment on the nature of the allegations against Jackson .
`` We have been given a brief sketch of what they [ the allegations ] are , but I 'd prefer not to discuss them at this time , '' Rounds tells NPR .
Rounds said that he and other members of the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee , had received a phone call from Chairman Sen. Johnny Isakson , R-Ga. , over the weekend advising them `` that he was in consultation with the White House and that he would let us know sometime during the early part of the week what the plans are going forward . ''
`` The chairman is aware of [ the allegations ] . He 's discussed them with the White House , '' Rounds said . `` It 's really up to the chairman as to what the next step would be — whether we continue on with the nomination process or if we hold up long enough to allow this to be vetted more fully before we bring it before the committee . ''
Rounds added : `` These are serious allegations , and they are ones we 'd certainly want to get through . ''
Jackson currently serves as White House physician . He defused doubts about the health and fitness of President Trump in January , describing his medical condition in excessively glowing terms . Jackson is a former combat surgeon who served with Navy bomb disposal units and instructed underwater salvage teams .
Trump picked Jackson to succeed David Shulkin , who was forced to resign as VA secretary after an inspector general 's report uncovered inappropriate expenses .
`` Some Republican colleagues have told me that they think the hearing should be postponed , which certainly deserves consideration , '' Sen. Richard Blumenthal , D-Conn. , who is also a member of the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee , told The Associated Press .
`` I think there may well be a need for more time , in fairness to Adm. Jackson , so he and the administration have an opportunity to answer these questions fully and fairly , '' Blumenthal said .
News of the postponement came a day after CIA Director Mike Pompeo , another Trump nominee who appeared in peril , was set on a glide path to approval as secretary of state clearing a key Senate committee .

A three-month old British 'terrorist ' baby was summoned to the US embassy for an interview , after his grandfather accidentally ticked the wrong box on a visa form.Paul Kenyon was filling out his grandson 's visa waiver form before the family went to Orlando , Florida when he accidentally ticked yes for the question , `` Do you seek to engage in or have you ever engaged in terrorist activities , espionage , sabotage , or genocide ? `` Kenyon only realized his mistake when the baby was refused a visa.Kenyon was quoted as saying The baby was brought to the London embassy to meet with officials . The round trip from Cheshire to London and back took about 10 hours , longer than the flight to Florida . `` I thought about taking him along in an orange jumpsuit , but thought better of it , '' said Kenyon . `` They did n't appear to have a sense of humor over it at all and could n't see the funny side . `` `` He 's obviously never engaged in genocide , or espionage , but he has sabotaged quite a few nappies in his time , though I did n't tell them that at the US embassy , '' he said.Harvey 's new visa did n't arrive on time and he and his parents had to book new flights to join the rest of the family in Florida a few days later . `` If you were a terrorist , I suspect you 'd not be ticking yes on the ESTA form anyway , '' Kenyon pointed out .

In April , it was announced that Oakland County would be implementing new voting machines by August and now Pontiac will be the first municipality to try them out .
Pontiac is the only city in the county holding a primary election this summer on Tuesday , August 8 and the city clerks office is currently in training for how to use the new Hart InterCivics Verity Voting Systems .
The machines come equipped with optical scan tabulators , Election Management System software , accessible voting devices and features that prevent ballots from being counted twice , Lisa Brown , Oakland County Clerk and Register of Deeds told The Oakland Press earlier this year .
The old election equipment has been in use for more than 10 years , according to Sherikia Hawkins , Pontiac city clerk . Shes worked 12 elections in Pontiac thus far .

Its very user friendly with its touchscreen ,  Hawkins said . One of the good features it has is that when you enter a ballot , an American flag will come up and say Thank you for voting ,  so you know that the process is complete.
Pontiacs city clerks office will eventually train hundreds of other election workers on how to use the new machines , such as how to open and close the polls and how to troubleshoot issues with the machines themselves . Secretary of State Ruth Johnson stated in January that all cities and townships throughout the state will have the new voting equipment by August of 2018 for the next statewide election .
Were the first city in the county to implement these and were optimistic that everything will be fine ,  Hawkins said .

LAS VEGAS ( AP )  Stephen Paddock kept a cigar at hand , even though he did n't smoke . But he was quick to notice those who did .
Then Paddock , a denizen of hazy casinos , would light his cigar and aim the smoke into the faces of those whose puffing annoyed him .
`` He was the king of microaggression , '' his brother , Eric , said .
Last week , Stephen Paddock returned to The Strip , where he spent countless hours playing high-limit video poker , and eyed the fun-seekers crowding his oasis . But this time he did so from a 32nd floor casino hotel suite . Then he smashed open a pair of windows with a hammer and opened fire with a carefully assembled arsenal , killing 58 fans gathered at an outdoor concert and injuring 500 more before killing himself .

Investigators and those who knew the 64-year-old say they can not fathom what drove him to slaughter or point to any specific grievance that might have set him off .
But details that have surfaced so far about him are clues , at least , to his mindset . Most mass shooters are younger . But Paddock  a one-time IRS agent and the son of a notorious bank robber  was the product of decades of experience and rumination .
Paddock was the oldest of four brothers . When he was 7 , his father , Benjamin Hoskins Paddock , tried to run down an FBI agent during a pursuit in Las Vegas . After the elder Paddock was caught and charged with a string of Phoenix bank robberies , agents searched the family 's home in Tucson , Arizona . A neighbor took little Stephen swimming while agents looked for evidence .
Benjamin Paddock was sentenced to 20 years in prison . But he escaped and spent a decade on the run .
`` He reportedly has suicidal tendencies and should be considered armed and dangerous , '' the FBI warned .
Paddock 's mother moved with her sons to Southern California , where she worked as a secretary and raised the boys on her own .
At John H. Francis Polytechnic High School , Paddock was a brainy kid with an `` irreverence toward authority , '' said Richard Alarcon , a former classmate who later served on the Los Angeles City Council .
For a school contest , Paddock and other students were assigned to design bridges without using glue .
Paddock 's bridge `` was like a brick , he put so much glue in it , '' Alarcon said . `` He did n't care ... It was like he just wanted to build the best bridge ever , regardless of what the rules were . ''
Paddock earned a degree in business administration from California State University , Northridge , in 1977 , then spent a decade working for the federal government , including six years as an IRS agent . He married and divorced twice , remaining on good terms with both former wives , family member say , and left government for a defense contractor .
Around the same time , he began investing in real estate . Eric Paddock said that together with his gambling exploits , the investments made his brother a multimillionaire .
At Reno 's Atlantis Casino , Paddock met Marilou Danley , a high-limit hostess there from 2010 to 2013 , and they became a couple . In a statement released by her lawyer , Danley said Paddock sent her to the Philippines weeks before the shooting and described him as `` a kind , caring , quiet man ... I hoped for a quiet future together with him . ''
Danley said Paddock wired her $ 100,000 and told her to buy a house for her family in the Philippines .
But workers at a casino Starbucks that the couple frequented say Paddock often scolded his girlfriend in public . Others who crossed paths with Paddock in recent months described him as despondent .
When Paddock came into a Reno car dealership late this summer , he told salesman Scott Armstrong he was depressed and had relationship troubles .
`` When 's the last time somebody told you their life was miserable ? It sticks with you , '' Armstrong said .
Still , investigators said they are finding little to explain what drove him to mass murder . He had no known criminal record , and investigators have not disclosed any evidence that he struggled financially or otherwise .
Paddock could sit for hours in front of video poker machines , often placing bets of $ 100 or more , rarely talking with anyone else but clearly conscious of his surroundings , said John Weinreich , a former executive casino host at Reno 's Atlantis .
He said Paddock had a habit of staring at other people , as if silently challenging them to a contest .
`` It was just his demeanor . It was like , ' I 'm here . Do n't cross me . Do n't look at me too long , ' '' Weinreich said .
Eric Paddock said his brother was generous with the privileges the casinos bestowed . He recalled how during one trip to Las Vegas , Stephen ordered them a sushi meal that must 've been worth $ 1,000 , but was paid for by a casino . Soon after , though , Stephen Paddock turned abruptly and demanded that his brother go get him a sandwich .
`` That 's the cost of being with Steve , '' he said .
Eric Paddock said he knew his brother owned a few handguns . But investigators say Paddock had bought 33 firearms in the last year alone , mostly rifles .
When Paddock visited B & S Guns in Garland , Texas , last year he asked about ways to modify a gun to make it easier to pull the trigger , owner Paul Peddle said . Danley , who was walking with a cane at the time , played with Peddle 's puppies while her boyfriend asked questions . And when it was time to go , Paddock walked helped her into the car .
`` He was very charismatic with her , very sweet , '' Peddle said .
When Paddock checked into the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino last week , he requested a room on a higher floor , but was told nothing was available . Then a room freed up and managers moved him to a suite on the 32nd floor .
On the house .

Phil Parkinson admitted that the system his Bolton Wanderers side used against Bristol City was only really developed the day before the match at the Macron Stadium .
Sammy Ameobi 's strike decided the game as they saw off a City side who put in a poor performance but still stayed fifth in the Sky Bet Championship despite the loss .
A delighted Parkinson heaped praise on his team and revealed that he had to change things up before the game against the Robins after the departure of Gary Madine on transfer deadline day .
“ I 'm very pleased . We changed the system and had about 20 minutes to work on it on the training ground yesterday [ Thursday ] , ” said Parkinson
“ The lads stuck to the task well and were disciplined and we stayed in the game . And moment of quality has won us the game . ”
“ After the week we had we were delighted with the three points , '' he added in reference to a busy period of incomings and outgoings at Bolton .
Former Newcastle United player Ameobi netted his first goal since October – a superb run and strike past Luke Steele in the City goal after shrugging off Joe Bryan .
And after troubling City for much of the 90 minutes , Parkinson had plenty of praise for man-of-the-match Ameobi .
“ He 's a very talented player and has played in the Premier League . He 's been great for us and we gave him another role tonight [ Friday ] and I thought he relished it . I 'm pleased the transfer window is closed .
“ He was unlucky not to make it two for us . I also thought Zach Clough looked good when he came on and he had a good chance . You wonder when you do n't take that chance are we going to get punished . ”
Parkinson added : “ But it was great resilience in our performance . ”

Game 3 promises to be an emotional night , with Maple Leafs Square packed and the Air Canada Centre rocking with towel giveaways for Toronto 's first home playoff game since 2013 . That the series with the Washington Capitals is tied at a game apiece is almost beside the point . “ I think everybody on our team saw that and understands how big a deal it is here in Toronto , ” said Leafs coach Mike Babcock . “ We walk around the community and have a real good feel for that . We 're just going to focus on doing what we do . “ We know how big the opportunity is , we 've earned it , and we 're going to do what we can to play right and have the right amount of emotional control . We do n't want to be too wired up either . ”

A video of a man filmed apparently engaging in sex acts with another female passenger in his Ryanair airline seat is making the rounds on the Internet .
Shawn Edmondon , a 31-year-old from Cumbria , is seen in the video being straddled and kissed in his seat by a blonde woman . Described as a `` ladies man '' by his friends , Edmonson was reportedly on a one-man bachelor party to the picturesque island off the coast of Spain while his 25-year-old pregnant fiancee Jenna Ross waited for him back home .
“ You could see the girl taking off her pants and he pulled his trousers off . She started riding him , '' neighboring passenger Kieran Williams told The Sun . “ I had to get my phone out . I have never seen anything like that . ”

Edmonson can be heard in the video asking neighbors in the aisles for condoms and continued his romp with the woman now revealed to be Tracey Bolton , a 39-year-old cafe owner and mother of three . Bolton is attempting to clear the air and her name by stating that `` it was just a lap dance '' and that she was mortified that the video has now gone viral .
Apparently the Ryanair flight crew did nothing to reprimand or stop Edmonson and Bolton 's sky high tryst , even after a passenger expressed discomfort with their behavior . After the footage became social media fodder , Ryanair released a statement claiming that `` we will not tolerate unruly , disruptive or inappropriate behaviour at any time and any passengers who appear to behave in an unacceptable manner may be liable for further sanctions . ”
The expectant Ms. Ross is said to be fuming with Edmonson . No word yet on if the wedding is off .
Normally , adjusting the screen timeout option is as easy as going into the display settings and changing the value . However , MIUI does things differently , and the setting is tucked away in the lock screen menu . What 's even more annoying is that the particular setting is labeled Sleep , which means you 're not going to be able to find the option if you search in the settings menu for screen timeout .
If you 're on a Xiaomi phone running MIUI 7 or higher , here 's how to change the screen timeout setting .
PHOENIX -- It 's over . The worst of the Chicago Cubs ' schedule is behind them . They survived it . Now they 're heading home from their final West Coast trip of the season in first place . Alone .
The St. Louis Cardinals caught up to the Cubs for a day but slipped right back into second after losing to the Atlanta Braves while Chicago won its series against the Arizona Diamondbacks with a 7-2 victory on Sunday in the regular-season finale between the clubs .
This one felt bigger .
A road series win , against a playoff team , right after the Cubs lost their cleanup hitter and starting catcher .
`` The best teams out there find a way to pick up the slack or at least bridge the gap until we can get a guy like [ Willson Contreras ] back , '' said Jake Arrieta , Sunday 's winning pitcher .
The Cubs are finding ways to win , even if it 's not always pretty . That middle game against the Diamondbacks qualified as ugly . But what about this Cubs season has been pretty ? Virtually nothing .
Kyle Schwarber is still striking out a ton , including seven times in a row from Saturday to Sunday . Javier Baez is hitting huge home runs , as he did on Sunday with a three-run blast , but then making bizarre errors in the field ( see : the sixth inning of Saturday 's loss ) . Meanwhile , reliever Carl Edwards Jr. continues his Jekyll and Hyde routine but looks like he might be coming around again .
Then there 's Kris Bryant .
Tired of talking about his pinkie injury , he got on base in 13 of 15 plate appearances at Chase Field . He 's heating up at the right time .
`` [ Bryant ] is getting locked in , '' said Cubs manager Joe Maddon . `` That 's fun to watch ... 3-3 road trip , West Coast , August , I 'll take it . ''

You better believe Maddon will take it . The Cardinals still have to come out west , as do the Milwaukee Brewers . Trips like that , this late in the season , have a tendency to be difficult . But that 's all in the past for the Cubs . Consider this : Their next four series are against current last-place teams , and the two after that come against fourth-place teams .
`` It really is difficult to [ travel out west ] , '' Maddon said . `` [ But ] I do n't look at breaks at the [ game ] schedule . I do n't do that . I do n't believe in that stuff . I always prefer us playing better teams . There 's always a trap in that thought . ''
Sure , there will be a game or two the Cubs are caught napping when they take on the Cincinnati Reds , Toronto Blue Jays and Philadelphia Phillies over the next couple of weeks . But if they do n't win more than they lose , it 'll be a shock . Their offense might not be consistent , but the Cubs are now getting positive performances out of the backbone of their lineup every night . Their defense got too much credit last season , while their offense was actually shaky at times -- just as it is now .
The Cubs became the Cubs of today because of their starting pitching . It 's back . It has been back since the All-Star break . They can survive everything else .
`` Two nights in a row , '' Maddon said . `` [ Jon ] Lester was outstanding . Jake was outstanding . ''
Remember when the soon-to-be free agent Arrieta was losing money with every passing start ? It looks like he has gained a lot of it back , and then some , as suitors will like this version of the righty . He 's pitching at a lower velocity but figuring out how to get guys out . And every once in a while , there 's an uptick on his fastball , which comes in handy . But his bread and butter is still his off-speed stuff . It had movement in and out of the strike zone on Sunday , baffling Diamondbacks hitters when Arrieta needed it most . He came out after only 91 pitches because Maddon is saving him for bigger games . That is Maddon 's style .
`` There 's more left , but you still have to get to that point , '' Arrieta said . `` We ca n't assume we 're in October . I still have my best pitching ahead of me , and I think a lot of guys in this room are in the same boat . Not just from our arms but guys in the lineup . I feel like there is room to improve . ''
It 's really the same narrative the Cubs have told all season . Some individuals can play better , yet they 're in first place despite underachieving . And now everyone has a chance to max out because the schedule will allow for it . But Maddon did mention one thing in particular he would like to see stabilize .
`` We have to become a more consistent group moving the baseball , force the other team into some mistakes , '' Maddon said .
If any one player symbolizes the up-and-down nature of the offense , it 's Baez . Pitch after pitch , out of the strike zone , he 'll swing and miss -- but throw him one anywhere near the zone and you can kiss it goodbye . Sunday 's three-run blast went 463 feet and was the big moment in the game .
`` I was looking for a breaking ball this last at-bat , and he finally threw it over the plate , '' Baez said .
Maddon offered his take on Baez .
`` There are times he can be frustrating , other times he hits three-run home runs in the upper tank , '' Maddon said .
That about sums up the offense this year . But here we are in mid-August with plenty of home games left , mostly against sub.-500 teams , and the Cubs are in control of their playoff fate . The Cardinals have had it easy lately , but at least on paper it gets harder for them . Now it 's the Cubs ' turn to gobble up wins against some bad teams -- as long as they do n't have a letdown . And how could they ? Too much is at stake . Maddon might not say it outright , but he knows the tide should be turning because his team has survived the worst .
`` We 're out west , [ St. Louis is ] back home , '' Maddon said . `` I thought they would be here to the very end . It 's going to be an interesting finish to the Central this year . ''
ISLAMABAD - Following the murder of a Mardan university student , senators , Monday called for reviewing the blasphemy law to punish those who level such false accusations on others .
Taking part in debate on brutal killing of Mashal Khan in Abdul Wali Khan University , the lawmakers in Senate called for stern action against those who took law into their own hands .
Dubbing the trend of mob justice dangerous , they stressed that stern action might be a starting point to prevent such incidents along with waging a war on ideological front to change this mindset . The suggestion of incorporating tolerance as subject in curriculum also came .
Regretting that the incident happened in a seat of learning and at a university named after Khan Abdul Wali Khan , PPP Senator Farhatullah Babar stressed the need for reviewing the blasphemy law . He said by stopping the misuse of law , such incidents should be prevented .
“ A suggestion from a religious scholar is that if someone levels wrong allegations of blasphemy , he should be dealt with the same punishment of blasphemy , ” Babar said . Quoting the Senate Law Committee of 1992 headed by Leader of the House Raja Zafarul Haq that amended the law by enhancing the sentence from life imprisonment to death , while implementing the decision of the Federal Shariat Court , Babar said the committee in its report had given some observations and this report could be taken as the starting point .
When the chairman pointed out that the incident was not misuse of law but an act of mob and street “ justice ” , Babar said there was no deterrence against mob mentality and effective legislation would serve to deter this .
JI Senator Sirajul Haq endorsed Babar , saying that if there were any lapses in the Section 295-C of Pakistan Penal Code regarding punishment of blasphemy , they should be reviewed .
“ But the public view is that the state and the government are not ready to implement this law in letter and spirit that lead to such incidents , ” he viewed .
Even if somebody has committed a crime , no individual or organisation has the right to punish him , Haq said .
PML-N senator and former general Abdul Qayyum said any flaw in the law should be addressed .
ANP lawmaker Ilyas Bilour said that the decision of the university administration to display a decision on the notice board about the holding of inquiry on blasphemy charges had led to the fuelling of the incident . He stressed the state as well as the government was not visible in the whole episode .
Winding up the discussion , Minister of State for Interior Baleeghur Rehman said that there was clarity on the issue at the political level .
Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and heads of political parties have condemned the incident .
There was a need to check intolerance , he said , and added work on a new curriculum was underway in this connection .
He said as many as 22 persons had so far been arrested in the incident , which included six university employees .
Earlier , the lawmakers from both sides welcomed the Senate Chairman , Mian Raza Rabbani , by thumping their desks when he entered the house .
On Friday , the chairman , while invoking his powers had not only adjourned the house abruptly but also refused to perform his official work because of the absence of ministers in the house and some ministries ' lack-lustre response to a number of questions .
After successful negotiations with the government during the last three days , the chairman re-convened the house .
Rabbani said that his decision was a result of the series of the incidents that took place in the past .
“ I had said in my first speech as chairman that I would try to uphold the sanctity of the house , ” he said .
The chairman reminded that he had earlier suspended the entry of defence minister for the entire sitting for not taking the business of the house seriously but such practice continued after that .
“ So things continued piling up and I had been pointing out the lapses , ” the chairman said .
He said that it remained a practice that the ministries did not answer a number of questions and the ministers did not remain present in the house to answer the questions . At that day , 11 questions were not answered and four ministers were also absent .
“ And this step had neither any relation with me in person nor it was a political drama and it [ was ] only related to the respect and sanctity of the house and the members , ” the chairman added .
The chairman Senate , while taking the house into confidence said that the Finance Minister , Ishaq Dar , in his four meetings with him assured him on behalf of the prime minister to resolve the issues .
Mentioning the points on which the government had agreed , the chair said that the ministers would give top priority to the parliamentary business and the government would take up the issue to the level of secretaries of the ministers about delay or lack of response to the questions .
The finance minister has said that the discussion would also be held on the implementation of the two rulings of the chairman including powers of the speaker to summon joint sitting in case of lapse of bills and the refusal of the National Bank of Pakistan to give information about those clients whom it had given loans .
The government would also hold discussions about the resolution passed by the Senate to enhance its powers .
“ In this way , a dialogue has started to resolve the issues , ” he said .
The chair also thanked the lawmakers and the leaders of the political parties including Imran Khan , Asfandyar Wali , Maulana Fazlur Rehman and Asif Ali Zardari for giving him support on the issue .

Our country 's health care has been passionately protected and placed under a microscope in the last few months . The national conversation has made health care a top concern for more people than ever , but for nurses like me who live and breathe it , this battle for better care never has left our minds ; it 's one we wage every day . Despite our efforts , Pennsylvania nurses rapidly are approaching a crisis .
I 've been a nurse for 12 years , working in three different Northeast Pennsylvania hospitals in almost every department . And it 's the same at facilities across Pennsylvania : nurses are working tirelessly with fewer and fewer resources , and it 's negatively impacting patient care .
I was reminded of this recently when someone arrived at my hospital in stable condition , but in need of care after suffering a heart attack . After my initial visit , about an hour passed before I could check on her again , and by that time , her breathing had become labored . I immediately transferred her to the critical care unit , but if I could have spent more time on her case from the start , I may have been able to prevent her complications .
Nurses often play the most vital role in patient care and are the frontline defense to catching and addressing complications . But the United States is experiencing a nursing shortage . The Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates the country will need 1.2 million registered nurses between 2014 and 2022 . By 2024 , nearly 700,000 working nurses are projected to retire or leave the labor force—and Pennsylvania has fewer nurses per patient than the national average .
In a typical shift , my co-workers and I regularly care for seven to 12 patients each . While that may not sound like a huge number , patients with more acute illnesses , who are confused or disoriented or who are generally frightened to be in a hospital , require and deserve extra attention from nursing staff . But these nuances are forgotten when hospital administrations dictate staffing levels and ignore nurses ' input , leading to chronic understaffing .
The problem extends beyond nurses . Some nights we might only get one nursing aide , whose job it is to assist nurses with essential tasks like answering patient call bells , delivering food , emptying bedpans and helping patients to the bathroom .
Meanwhile , the responsibilities given to nurses continue to grow . I spend nearly half of my shift — about five hours — filling out charts that detail the care I 've provided to each of my patients . Keeping accurate , real-time records is critical to quality care , but it should n't come at the expense of caring for a person in his time of need . The question is n't what 's more important : recording a patient 's urine output or helping another to the bathroom . The answer is both .
Staffing decisions , clinical directives and administrative requirements often are made by hospital leadership without the input of those on the hospital floor . For example , a requirement to take patient vital signs every four hours . A nurse 's top priority is patient safety . We will check a patient 's vital signs every 10 minutes if we deem it clinically necessary , but these sweeping instructions take away the autonomy of nurses to make the decisions we are rigorously trained to make and create extra work that removes us from our patient 's bedsides , where most complications or symptoms are spotted .
That 's why nurses become nurses , after all . We want to form relationships with our patients and positively impact those we care for . But as the time we are actually able to spend with patients diminishes , many nurses are changing their career plans . A lot of newer nurses are pursuing higher degrees so they can go into private practice as nurse practitioners . I 've also known good , experienced nurses who have decided on an early retirement—both of which make the staffing crisis worse .
Much can be done to give nurses the support they need and patients the safest possible environment . Hospital administrators should have more open communication with nurses and respect the feedback they are given from the hospital floor . We know that hospitals , especially in rural areas , have stretched budgets . But when it comes to patient care , we should n't be pinching pennies .
In the past year , Pennsylvania legislators in the House and Senate have proposed bills to establish safe staffing levels and require hospitals and other care facilities share their nurse-to-patient ratios publicly . These bills could help consumers make informed decisions for their care and allow patients , workers and legislators to hold hospitals accountable for unsafe practices .
I 'm encouraged by these moves , but immediate action is necessary to strengthen the workforce and avert a health care crisis . Hospital systems should be designed with quality care , not quick profits , as the top priority . Amidst a national debate about the future of health care , I hope hospital executives and policymakers will listen to nurses ' voices and staff with patients in mind .
LAHORE : After a series of successful talks with the government of Punjab , the Young Doctors Association ( YDA ) has ended its 15-day long strike . The protesting doctors have announced to return to outdoor patient departments ( OPDs ) from today .
The protests started on August 1st when the young doctors refused to see patients until their demands of amendment in Central Induction Policy and raise in salaries and allowances were fulfilled .
Moreover , a summary of the impromptu doctors would be sent to Punjab Chief Minister Shehbaz Sharif and the notification of the dismission of young doctors during the protest days would be withdrawn . The academic councils of all colleges will review the Central Induction Policy as well .

OWINGS MILLS , Md . -- Marshal Yanda would n't say whether his surgically repaired left shoulder would be ready for the start of Baltimore Ravens training camp in late July .
The six-time Pro Bowl guard did offer one guarantee , however .
`` I can just tell you Week 1 , I 'm going to be out there , for sure , '' Yanda said after Wednesday 's mandatory minicamp practice .
Ravens guard Marshal Yanda says his surgically repaired left shoulder 'feels really good ' and he expects to be ready for Week 1 of the season . Jamison Hensley/ESPN
Yanda has been sidelined all offseason but has been lifting and getting stronger . Coach John Harbaugh said in March that he expects Yanda , 32 , to return by training camp .
`` It feels really good , '' Yanda said . `` I have n't had any setbacks . It 's been a smooth process . ''
Yanda tore the labrum in his left shoulder on Oct. 9 , and some thought the injury would be season ending . Instead , he only missed three games .
Editor 's Picks Signing with Ravens 'just felt right , ' Maclin says Receiver Jeremy Maclin said he 's ready to `` build something special '' after the veteran signed with the Ravens .
In order for him to be effective with the injury , Yanda switched from right to left guard for the final seven games . He said getting comfortable with the position change and trying to perform at a high level at it was `` one of the toughest things I 've done . ''
`` I was happy to finish it that way , rather than go IR and get the surgery then , '' Yanda said . `` It was nice to go down fighting . Obviously , we did n't finish what we wanted to do . But I , at least , wanted to die trying doing it . ''
This is n't the first time Yanda has had to miss most of the offseason while recovering from an injury . He underwent surgery on his right shoulder after the Ravens won the Super Bowl four years ago and did n't return until training camp . Yanda still went to the Pro Bowl that season .
`` We all understand that it 's a game of injuries , '' Yanda said . `` You have to fight through those if you want to have a career in the NFL . ''
Farmers across Northern Ireland are being forced to turn their properties into fortresses to protect themselves from serial thieves , it has been claimed .
And fear of having their farms staked out by criminals is causing major anxiety for people living in rural areas .
The warnings come as a new report shows that rural crime cost £2.5 million in Northern Ireland last year .
Although the 2016 figure is down 15 % on 2015 , the cost of theft from farms across the UK has risen sharply in first half of 2017 .
ATVs ( all terrain vehicles ) and power tools were among the items most commonly targeted by thieves in Northern Ireland .
The report 's authors , NFU Mutual , said countryside criminals continue to become more brazen and farmers are now having to continually increase security and adopt new ways of protecting their equipment .
“ In some parts of the region , farmers are having to turn their farmyards into fortresses to protect themselves from repeated thieves who are targeting quads , tractors and power tools .
“ They are using tracking devices on tractors , video and infra-red surveillance in their farmyards and even DNA markers to protect sheep from rustlers , ” said Martin Malone , NFU Mutual regional manager for Northern Ireland .
Newry & Armagh Assemblyman William Irwin described the report as “ deeply concerning ” .
The report reveals that being “ staked out ” is the biggest worry for country people , followed closely by longer police response times in rural areas .
The threat of becoming a victim of rural crime , and regular reports of suspicious characters watching farms , is said to be “ causing high levels of anxiety amongst farmers ” who know their rural location makes them vulnerable to attacks .
Mr Irwin , a former chairman of Stormont 's agriculture committee , said rural crime , as shown by the latest figures , “ continues to be a deeply concerning issue for the farming community and rural dwellers generally ” .
The DUP representative , whose own farm has been targeted by thieves , said : “ I had a vehicle stolen on one occasion from my farm and on another occasion thieves attempted to steal a tractor but caught the wheel on another piece of machinery puncturing the tyre . Thankfully they failed to take the tractor but I know that many others have had valuable machinery stolen and some have been repeatedly targeted by thieves . ”
Mr Irwin added : “ Rural crime is a costly crime to the victim and in particular it causes great inconvenience and distress .
“ It is vital that the PSNI immediately puts adequate resources towards stamping out rural crime and it is vital that the criminal networks actively targeting our rural community are weeded out and brought before the courts . ”
Horse boxes and tractors were also among the high value items stolen from farms .
NFU Mutual 's early theft claims statistics for the first half of this year show a UK-wide sharp rise of over 20 % , raising concerns that a “ new wave of rural crime is hitting the countryside ” .
The north east of England was the worst affected region with rural crime costing £7.3m last year , while the lowest cost of the nine main regions was Wales with £1.3m .
Scotland also fared better than Northern Ireland with a total loss of £1.6m compared to the Province 's £2.5m . The UK-wide total was just over £39 million .
NFU manager Mr Malone said : “ Our advice to people living and working in the countryside is to regularly evaluate your current security measures making improvements where necessary , remain vigilant and report any suspicious activity to the local police and local farm watch schemes . ”
In March last year , around 200 farms in the Armagh City , Banbridge and Craigavon Council area took part in a “ forensic marking ” pilot scheme in an effort to protect their property .
At the time , the then justice minister David Ford acknowledged the “ devastating impact , ” of farm thefts , and said : “ Used in conjunction with warning signs , forensic marking is an effective theft deterrent and can aid in assisting the police in tracing the rightful owners of recovered property . ”
“ It was all a blur , ” she added with a laugh . “ This time of year is a blur of activity . ”
“ We had to put a full company callout to see who would come out that late at night ( to lay out shirts ) , ” said Shannon Hosford , the senior vice-president of marketing and fan experience ( check ! ) for Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment Ltd. “ We had one employee come out with her two kids , just for fun , to be part of the experience .
In the hours between , staff furiously decorated the ACC bowl in playoff T-shirts , carefully laying a shirt over every one of the 19,8000 seats . Fans arrived for the matinee basketball game to an arena virtually painted — as if by a giant paint brush — in a camouflage pattern of black , grey and white .
The Toronto Rock were playing at the Air Canada Centre on Friday evening . The Raptors were tipping off against Indiana at 12:30 p.m. Saturday .
On one crazy night during last year 's NBA playoffs , the Toronto Raptors ' creative team pulled off a quick-change magic trick that would have made David Blaine proud .
Hosford was sitting in her office of MLSE 's fifth-floor headquarters adjacent to the Air Canada Centre on a recent afternoon . The offices were buzzing with pre-playoff energy . T-shirts , in a variety of colours and designs , spilled off desktops .
While the Raptors lost Game 1 of this year 's opening-round series against Milwaukee on Saturday night , the MLSE staff , at least , came to play . The theme around these playoffs is buffalo plaid , and the ACC was dressed in swaths of red and black to create a jumbo-sized buffalo plaid pattern .

Raptors , Lowry expect better in Game 2
Greek Freak paints Raptors into a corner
MLSE takes pride in pushing the creative envelope , and staying ahead of the league , while providing fans with that “ We The North ” feeling that is uniquely Canadian .
Other teams have tried to mimic it . The Pacers had their “ We the Gold ” campaign against the Raptors last season . Some Miami fans wore “ We the South ” T-shirts to the Heat 's second-round series against Toronto .
“ We 're fine with that , ” Hosford said . “ We take great pride when someone tries to do that . We own that . ”
Last season 's arena designs also included a giant Maple Leaf , a red and white starburst , and the letters “ 6IX ” ( a nod to Toronto 's Drake-inspired nickname ) and “ YYZ ” spelled out in black and white .
This season 's opening-round games will stick to the plaid theme . The designs are first drawn up on a computer , then blocks of the design are tested on the arena seats .
There are enough T-shirts and designs for a full seven-game series .
“ There are contingency plans for everything , ” said Dustin Rideout , MLSE 's head of brand and fan experience .
“ You do n't want to jinx yourself but we 're the department that 's talking about playoff initiatives before anyone wants to talk about it , ” Hosford added . “ We have to be ready . ”
The Raptors have arguably led the league in branding since launching their iconic “ We The North ” campaign ahead of the 2014 playoffs . The brainchild of artistic agency Sid Lee , the campaign 's launch was originally planned to coincide with the Raptors ' rebrand in 2015 . But MLSE 's front office , including Raptors president Masai Ujiri , loved the concept so much , they fast-tracked it .
“ We The North ” is like a wink between Canadians , “ like we know what this means , ” Hosford said .
“ ‘ We The North ' has been the thing for us for many seasons now , everybody has embraced it so much , so we 'd never walk away from anything like that , ” Rideout added .
“ None of it is manufactured , which I think is why people gravitate towards it outside of our borders , because we 're not trying to create some new ritual or say something about our fans that is n't true , ” he added . “ The press on the other side of the border writes about it all the time , how our fans are amazing , and crazed and have such pride . ”
They do n't look outside Toronto at what other arenas are doing , and they credit Ujiri as the engine that drives them .
“ We like to do our own . We like to set the standard and we want to be different every year , ” Hosford said . “ And frankly , that 's from Masai He 's like ‘ We 're Toronto , we 're outsiders . ' It all goes back to ‘ We The North ' and that statement .
“ Obviously with buffalo plaid being very on-trend , it 's great . But also , what else is ‘ We The North ? ' It really speaks to our statement . Masai loved that . ”
And if you walk round the hallways of Air Canada Centre , you wo n't find many photos of individual Raptors players .
“ When we showcase our players , they 're together , they 're embracing , it 's about the team , ” Hosford said . “ The whole philosophy for the front office is : this is a team , and we want to focus on the team and not just one individual . ”
Game 2 is on Tuesday in Toronto , then the series shifts to Milwaukee for Games 3 and 4 .
Ciudad Victoria , Tamaulipas — Authorities confirmed the murder of a Spanish woman visiting with her family at a local beach in this border state . The region where gunmen kidnapped her and her remains were later found is seeing a spike in cartel skirmishes for control .
Pilar Garrido Santamans was kidnapped by two gunmen on July 2 along a highway leading to the town of La Pesca , a small community by the Gulf of Mexico , Breitbart Texas reported . Two weeks ago , police found human remains in the rural community of Villa de Casas not far from the place of the kidnapping . State authorities carried out a series of DNA tests that confirmed that they belonged to Garrido Santamans

Through a short news release by the Tamaulipas Attorney General 's Office , authorities revealed that the family of the now deceased victim and the Spanish government were notified of the lab results .
The kidnapping and murder caused international media response and revealed once more the lack of security conditions in this border state . The region where the crime took place continues to be fought over by various drug cartels . Breitbart Texas reported on how the cartel faction known as Vieja Escuela Z or “ Old School Z ” is fighting with the rival faction Cartel Del Noreste over lucrative drug trafficking routes . The ongoing fighting between the two cartel factions and their allies has brought lawlessness into various areas of the state where kidnappings , extortions , and disappearances are becoming commonplace .
The Spanish visitor , her husband , and young son intended to visit the beach in La Pesca but on their drive back to Ciudad Victoria , they were intercepted by two gunmen who forced them to stop . The yet-unidentified gunmen took Garrido Santamans but left her husband and child behind . Relatives reached out to various news outlets , including Breitbart Texas , after the initial investigation proved lacking in their view . State officials remained tight-lipped about the case , only publicly speaking about the high-profile murder on few occasions . After getting intense media scrutiny for three weeks , authorities apparently stepped up efforts .
With the help of helicopters , police dogs , and search parties , authorities worked to find the remains of the Spanish victim . After traveling through the various communities between Ciudad Victoria and La Pesca , police were able to locate her remains in the town of Villa de Casas , 25 minutes away from Ciudad Victoria .
The Spanish citizens had moved to Tamaulipas with her husband three years before her murder .
Editor 's Note : Breitbart Texas traveled to the Mexican States of Tamaulipas , Coahuila , and Nuevo León to recruit citizen journalists willing to risk their lives and expose the cartels silencing their communities . The writers would face certain death at the hands of the various cartels that operate in those areas including the Gulf Cartel and Los Zetas if a pseudonym were not used . Breitbart Texas ' Cartel Chronicles are published in both English and in their original Spanish . This article was written by “ Francisco Morales ” from Tamaulipas .
SYDNEY : - A young freshwater crocodile found sunbathing on a riverbank in suburban Sydney by a family on their Sunday stroll has been returned to the zoo from where it was stolen . The weary-looking crocodile , measuring 80 centimetres ( 31.5 inches ) in length , was a surprising discovering on the banks of a river southwest of Sydney for local resident Aaron Hughes while out enjoying a walk with his family Easter Sunday . The baby reptile put up little resistance , Hughes said , when he grabbed it from behind the neck and carried it home .
“ ( I ) did n't need to sit on it or anything like that , just picked it up and walked it up to the house , ” Hughes told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation . “ Basically it did look a bit malnourished and we were n't sure what to do. ” Hughes contacted the police who have identified the young crocodile as one of two , named Snap and Crackle , who were stolen from the Get Wild Animal Experiences travelling zoo in March . “ We are so very pleased to announce today we had one of our missing crocodiles returned , ” the zoo said in a Facebook post Sunday . “ He is very cold , thin and lethargic but we are hoping with some TLC he will be back to normal in no time. ” Police hold out hope that the other stolen crocodile will be found soon .
Chicago does not have the strictest gun laws in the country . It 's time for gun lovers to stop spreading that lie .
A decade ago that was indeed a title Chicago wore proudly . We were the only major city that still had an ordinance banning residents from keeping a handgun in their home .
The handgun ban made us the primary target of the National Rifle Association and the Second Amendment Foundation , and in 2010 the U.S. Supreme Court forced Chicago to fall into line with the rest of the country .
Since then , the courts have peeled off so many layers of our once stellar gun ordinance that it 's barely recognizable . We 're still maneuvering to keep gun stores and shooting ranges from opening in the city limits . But the courts have ruled against us on that , too , so we know it 's just a matter of time .
Remember that old requirement that gun owners in Chicago register their firearms with the city and obtain a permit ? Well , that 's gone too .
And thanks to the Illinois General Assembly , which was pressured by the federal courts to pass a concealed carry law in 2013 , people can walk the streets of Chicago with a gun attached to their waist and another strapped to their ankle .
Sorry , gun lovers , your attempts to use Chicago as a prop to bolster your claims that gun control laws do nothing to curb gun violence just do n't hold up .
New York , in fact , has stricter gun laws on the books than Chicago . And guess what ? Its homicide numbers are heading toward historic lows . Los Angeles has some pretty tough gun laws too . Its homicide numbers also pale compared with Chicago 's .
Those kinds of details do n't fit the conservative , pro-gun narrative , though . To use New York as a talking point , they 'd have to admit that strict gun laws might actually have an impact on homicide rates .
We do n't make excuses for our ghastly homicide numbers in Chicago . With 762 people killed last year , no one has to remind us that we have a serious gun problem . We own it . And we have to do something about it .
But we are tired of Donald Trump and pro-gun advocates using our city to promote their political agenda .
White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders dragged Chicago into the fray again on Monday when responding to a reporter 's question about gun policy in the aftermath of the mass shooting in Las Vegas .
“ One of the things that we do n't want to do is try to create laws that wo n't stop these types of things from happening , ” Sanders said at a news conference . “ I think if you look to Chicago where you had over 4,000 victims of gun-related crimes , they have the strictest gun laws in the country and that certainly has n't helped there . ”

Sanders should listen to U.S. Rep. Robin Kelly , D-Ill. , who argues that the problem is Chicago being surrounded by red states that have completely surrendered to the pro-gun lobby .
With no gun stores in Chicago and no background check loopholes for private sales , one thing is clear . The guns being used to kill people on the streets are n't originating in Chicago . They 're coming from someplace else .
When politicians and others repeat that ridiculous statement about Chicago 's gun laws , it shows how out of touch they are with the problems urban areas face when it comes to gun violence .
When it comes to gun laws , big cities are only as strong as the states that border them . And in Chicago 's case , that 's Indiana . Thanks to Vice President Mike Pence , the former governor , Indiana has some of the weakest gun laws in the nation .
While Illinois has gone to great lengths to see that background checks are done for all gun purchases , Indiana has done the opposite . To buy a weapon in Illinois , the owner must have a valid firearms owner 's identification card , issued by the Illinois State Police .
With no permit or license required to purchase a gun in Indiana , it is incredibly easy for a trafficker to drive across the state line , obtain a gun and use it to commit a homicide on the streets of Chicago .
Those with felony convictions commonly use straw purchases , in which they enlist someone with a clean record to purchase multiple guns and bring them into the city .
Law enforcement officials say 60 percent of the guns confiscated on the streets of Chicago come from Indiana , Wisconsin and Mississippi . The other 40 percent come from suburban Cook County and nearby suburbs .
It 's tough , but we can try to sort out the bad apples in our own state and shut them down . But we 're helpless when it comes to regulating Indiana , Wisconsin and Mississippi .
Congress could do something , though . Lawmakers could pass legislation requiring universal background checks . That would close federal loopholes on background checks at gun shows and other private sales .
Congress could also limit the number of guns that can be purchased by one person in a period of time . And lawmakers could toughen penalties for straw purchases .
Military-style assault weapons already are banned in the city of Chicago , but in most other places in Illinois and in most other states , they can be purchased as easily as a handgun . If Congress really wanted to stop massacres like the one in Las Vegas from occurring , lawmakers could pass a federal assault weapons ban to replace the one that expired in 2004 .
The gun lovers in Washington do n't want to talk about these things , though . It 's a lot easier to just keep picking on Chicago .

SACRAMENTO ( AP ) _ The winning numbers in Friday afternoon 's drawing of the California Lottery 's `` Daily 3 Midday '' game were :
4-6-3
( four , six , three )
One of the ads in the big game Sunday will feature a really big western Iowa bull . A 15-second Cenex commercial features “ Albert the Bull ” , some actors , and some real Audubon residents .
Audubon Chamber of Commerce president Brandon Toft says the Albert spot is expected to air sometime around the third quarter . He says two representatives of Minnesota-based CHS Energy 's advertising branch appeared at the banquet to show the commercial and also a short documentary on Albert .
“ We are going to get more than our 15 seconds of fame . They put together this really nice , it 's about 5 minutes , short documentary on Albert the Bull featuring some members of our community who were either around then , or helped put him together . Kind of some people who everybody knows , ” Toft says .
He was impressed with the documentary . “ It 's just really nicely done , ” Toft says , ” you know you see documentaries on other things and you think that does n't look like it looks here , when it 's kind of made for TV . It was really professionally done . It was just really neat to see . ”
The City was contacted late last Summer about shooting the commercial on location . Albert , who is 53-years old and 28-feet tall , was showing his age , so the town reacted quickly to give him some much-needed repairs . He says they got a grant and got it repainted and made a new sign for Albert .
The filming took place in mid-November . Toft said the residents of Audubon County are excited to see the Cenex ad , which will make a play on the words “ Super Bowl ” and turn it into “ Super Bull. ” And , while the short version of the commercial that debuts on TV for viewers throughout the Midwest Region features mostly actors , at the end , there is a scene featuring members of the community standing in front of Albert . Toft was not present for that particular shot…he was busy with basketball that morning .

NEW DELHI : Following external affairs minister Sushma Swaraj 's confirmation today about the death of 39 Indian hostages held captive by ISIS in Iraq , Congress leaders questioned the delay in confirming the news and demanded that the government should reveal all the details related to the abduction of the Indian citizens.Criticising the government for giving `` false hope '' to the families of the hostages , senior Congress leader Shashi Tharoor was among the first to question the government over the delay in revealing information on the fate of abducted Indian citizens . `` This is saddening for every Indian , rest I would ask why this information was delayed by the government , they should tell how it happened ( and ) when they died . Also , the way government gave high hopes to the families was not right , '' Tharoor said.Congress leader and Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh extended his condolences to the family members of the hostages and alleged that the news of the death was known “ much earlier ” . `` We had expected this , it should have been announced earlier , it was known much earlier , '' he said.Most of the 39 killed were from Punjab and were working on projects near Mosul when they were kidnapped during their evacuation.Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad asked the central and state governments to extend financial assistance , including government jobs , for the family members of the people killed in Iraq . `` Congress offers condolences to families of those who were killed in Iraq . We are with their families in this painful and sad time . It is our demand that they should be given financial assistance by central and state government and also employment in government service , '' he said.Earlier today , Swaraj confirmed in the Rajya Sabha that the 39 Indian citizens who were kidnapped in 2014 by ISIS in Iraq have been killed . `` Yesterday , we got information that DNA samples of 38 people have matched and DNA of the 39th person has matched 70 percent , '' she said.In July last year , Swaraj firmly said in Parliament that she would not declare the 39 Indians dead without concrete proof or evidence . `` It is a sin to declare a person dead without concrete evidence . I will not do this sin , '' Swaraj said in a statement in the Lok Sabha in 2017 .

Should the Ottawa Senators consider trading Erik Karlsson ?
Greg Wyshynski , senior NHL writer : To set the scene : Karlsson recently told the Ottawa Sun that he 's not going to give the Senators a hometown discount when he hits unrestricted free agency in the summer of 2019 . This sparked some league-wide speculation about his future in Ottawa , with `` Hockey Night In Canada '' analyst Nick Kypreos saying Senators owner Eugene Melnyk was upset over the declaration and Elliotte Friedman reporting that the Senators asked Karlsson for his list of approved teams for a trade -- something he said was procedural , but no less intriguing .
Whether the Senators trade Karlsson is almost two different questions , depending entirely on Karlsson 's aspirations . If it seems like he 's most interested in greener pastures than being a career Senators , then Ottawa has to entertain the idea . If he wants to remain in Ottawa , and the question is whether they should flip one of the best defensemen in NHL history before he 's 30 in exchange for rebuilding blocks , then the answer is a resounding `` no . ''
As I mentioned in the Awards Watch , Karlsson has the Nicklas Lidstrom effect , in which even an average season is exponentially better than 99 percent of other defensemen 's great seasons . Karlsson 's season has been dragged down by his injury rehab and the general putridity of his team , but I do n't view it as a decline . And , again , what 's a decline for Erik Karlsson ? God to demigod ?
Karlsson is part of the solution , not the problem . He 's a foundational pillar for a rebuild ; and frankly , the timetables for rebuilds in the NHL are so unpredictable he could still be in his prime when they circle back to contention . He 's a defenseman who has several years of elite play left in him . He 's a franchise player for whom there will never be equal value returning to Ottawa ; and please recall that a player of Karlsson 's stature and financial wants has a limited trade market , because max value hinges on him signing there .
Plus , these franchise player deals rarely work for the franchise dealing them . Ron Francis , for example , was 27 when the Hartford Whalers traded him to the Pittsburgh Penguins . Ask the Whalers how that turned out . Or do n't , because they do n't bloody exist anymore .

Emily Kaplan , national NHL reporter : These are bleak times in Ottawa . A team that was among the peskiest in the Eastern Conference last season is floundering ; at 9-12-7 , the Senators are seventh in the anemic Atlantic Division . They 've lost 11 of their past 12 and their splashy early-season move -- essentially swapping venerable Kyle Turris for a younger , more talented center in Matt Duchene -- is n't panning out yet . Duchene 's stats in Ottawa : 14 games , two goals , two assists , a minus-11 rating . Join me for a resounding : woof .
Does that mean Ottawa should do something drastic ? Maybe . ( This is still a team that reached the Eastern Conference finals last season , so I would n't be too trigger-happy just yet . ) Does that mean Ottawa should trade Karlsson ? I do n't know how to be more emphatic when I say : no , no , absolutely not .
As Greg notes above , the root of the issue is n't shaking things up , but rather squeezing value from a player who might not want to stick around for the long term . Free agency is a remarkable thing because it empowers players . They are n't bound to the teams that drafted them and they can gracefully exit situations they do n't want to be in . That said , is there any indication yet that Karlsson does n't want to be in Ottawa ? No . He 's just saying he wants to make sure he can maximize his value -- which is fully within his rights . So if there 's any chance Karlsson can be manning this blue line for the foreseeable future -- which there is -- you keep him . Because , as Greg also notes , Karlsson is a transcendent , generational player . If you 're a GM with that type of talent , you do everything in your power to build around him .
Trading Karlsson would only accelerate the nosedive the Senators are in now , and why on Earth would any reasonable GM instigate that ?
Chris Peters , NHL Insider : Before I get into whether or not the Sens should trade Karlsson , can we talk about how absurd it is that the owner is reportedly miffed that one of the best players in the world made it known that he wants to be paid what he 's worth ? I get it , you 've got to look after your bottom line , and no owner really wants to spend more money , but Karlsson has been playing at a discounted rate essentially for the life of his current contract . Paying what he 's worth on the next contract is the least the Senators could do for a player of Karlsson 's caliber .
I ca n't even begin to think of the return the Sens would command if they ever wanted to entertain the idea of moving Karlsson . Replacing his minutes , his point production , his impact on possession and his star power in a market where it 's already tougher to draw is a virtual impossibility . You just ca n't get better trading away that kind of talent .
With all of that said , if the alternative is losing Karlsson in free agency for nothing , GM Pierre Dorion has to at least consider the option of trading his star defenseman , but certainly not yet . I ca n't see any reason for the Sens to let him go before exhausting all possibilities of signing him to a long-term deal . If it ever becomes clear that they wo n't be able to make it work , then you 've got until next season 's trading deadline to make this decision .
Part of that is going to be selling Karlsson on the long-term vision of the franchise and showing the path to the Stanley Cup . As close as they got last year to the Cup Final , this season has made those title chances seem a little more distant . The Sens do have some good young players in their system who should figure into both their short-term and long-term plans . Players like Thomas Chabot , Colin White , Filip Chlapik , Alex Formenton and Logan Brown , among others , have some high-end qualities that could help when this team starts transitioning away from its big-ticket veterans . That helps the recruiting pitch a bit , but only if Ottawa is willing to pay full freight for its star . This whole will-they , won't-they saga is going to be incredible to watch .
Tonight 's Laulima family has just one wish , and that 's for help in getting to the hospital to see their son , their brother , their uncle .
He 's on a long road to recovery since an accident earlier this year .
Elton Naki Jr. , 17 , is a starting corner for the Castle High School football team and a guard on the basketball team . He 's the older brother to two sisters , and a younger brother to a sister who gave birth last May .
Just three days after becoming an uncle , Naki was riding in the bed of a pickup truck and fell out .
He had brain surgery and was in a coma for 31 days , and had a stroke while in a coma . He remains at Kapiolani Medical Center for Women and Children .
“ It 's been so much to endure , ” said Naki 's mother , Arlette Naki .
Arlette Naki says Naki 's doing better . He does rehab , working on mobility , trying to get him to walk , talk , eat again . They take him out of bed and push him around in his wheelchair , but recovering from traumatic brain injury will be a long road .
“ We hang on to hope , because of how much he fights . He fights every day , ” Arlette Naki said . “ The more we see him fight , the stronger we become , and that 's what 's good about it , and that 's where our positive reaction to everything every day comes out from . ”
Arlette Naki says they 're so grateful for the doctors at Kapiolani , and just knowing people are supportive , and that 's enough , she says .
But after we kept asking , she said transportation in order to get to Naki , while also getting his sisters to their activities , is something they 're working for . Right now , they travel by bus .
“ One of our goals this year or at least at the beginning of next year is to get a vehicle that 's able to transport us to and from the hospital , ” she said .
Other than that , Naki himself is their Christmas this year .
“ This incident changed us tremendously , taught us so many things that people take for granted today , ” Arlette Naki said . “ Just for Elton living and breathing and having a second chance is basically our Christmas . ”
Wacha , 3 home runs send Cardinals over Brewers 6-1
Wacha , 3 home runs send Cardinals over Brewers 6-1
Associated Press NEWS News 30 May 2018 , 14:43 IST 11 Share Options × Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Reddit Google+ Email
MILWAUKEE ( AP ) — Michael Wacha is tweaking his delivery and getting results .
The St. Louis righty pitched two-hit ball for 6 2/3 innings and the Cardinals hit three home runs to beat the Milwaukee Brewers 6-1 on Tuesday night .
Harrison Bader , Matt Carpenter and Francisco Pena each hit solo drives to help St. Louis top the NL Central leaders .
Wacha ( 6-1 ) allowed just one run . He walked four and struck out three , and combined with two relievers to limit the Brewers to three hits .
`` They 've got a tough lineup over there . They 've got a really good team , '' Wacha said of the Brewers , who had won 10 of their previous 12 games . `` It 's all about execution out there on the mound . Guys were playing great defense behind me . ''
Wacha improved to 6-0 over his last 10 starts with a 2.31 ERA in that span .
`` He was in control all the way , '' Cardinals manager Mike Matheny said . `` He ran into a little bit of trouble late .
`` He 's not relying on just the fastball-changeup , '' he said . `` He has altered his mechanics to be able to make the high pitch and to get right back to being in the bottom of the zone when he wants to . It 's a lot harder than it sounds . ''
The Cardinals took control by scoring four times in the second inning off Zach Davies ( 2-5 ) . Bader led off with a home run , Carpenter walked with the bases loaded and Jedd Gyorko wound with a two-run single when his slowly hit grounder escaped the reach of second baseman Hernan Perez .
Davies , making his second start since coming off the disabled list with a right rotator cuff injury , allowed five runs and eight hits over five innings .
`` Everything has n't felt great the last couple games starting back , but you 're at the top level , you 've got to find it sometime , '' Davies said .
Perez got the Brewers ' first hit with a soft single to center to lead off the fifth . The only other hit off Wacha was a sharp single by Eric Sogard in the seventh , the last batter the Cardinals pitcher faced .
`` He had command of all his pitches tonight , hitting his spots well , '' Sogard said . `` You 've just got to try and get a mistake and make the most of it . ''
Milwaukee scored in the seventh on a pinch-hit double by Jonathan Villar off reliever Sam Tuivailala . Jordan Hicks finished with two perfect innings , striking out four .
STREAK STOPS
The Brewers ' string of errorless games ended at eight and a strange play was the culprit . Catcher Manny Pina was called for catcher 's interference , allowing Marcell Ozuna to reach base leading off the third inning . Milwaukee is 12-14 when it commits an error and 23-7 when it does not .
FEELING GOOD
Cardinals catcher Francisco Pena tied his career high with three hits , including a long home run off the center-field background off reliever Dan Jennings in the eighth . `` It felt great , '' Pena said . `` I 'm just trying to swing at my pitch and not the pitcher 's pitches , and when I do that I think I 'll be real good . ''
TRAINER 'S ROOM
Cardinals : OF Dexter Fowler remained out of the lineup for a third straight game after being hit by a pitch on the right knee on Saturday in Pittsburgh . Fowler is hitting .157 in 43 games this season . ... RHP Carlos Martinez is scheduled for a Thursday start with Double-A Springfield and will be limited to 50-60 pitches . He was placed on the disabled list on May with a right upper back strain .
Brewers : SS Tyler Saladino sprained his left ankle on a play in the third inning and had to be helped off the field . Saladino jammed his ankle into the second-base bag as he took a throw from Perez on a force play . Saladino , who was hitting .324 , is headed to the disabled list , Brewers manager Craig Counsell said . He added that SS Orlando Arcia would be a candidate to return from Triple-A Colorado Springs .
UP NEXT
Cardinals : RHP Alex Reyes returns after missing all of last season following Tommy John surgery on his right elbow . In four rehab starts in the St. Louis minor league system , Reyes has tossed 23 scoreless innings while striking out 44 of 82 batters faced .
Brewers : RHP Junior Guerra ( 3-3 , 2.98 ERA ) will make his 10th start of the season and second against the Cardinals .
During the opening ceremony of Multan 's Metro Bus Project , the Punjab Chief Minister Shahbaz Sharif said that 60 million dollars that belonged to the people of Pakistan were taken to Switzerland by Asif Ali Zardari as a bribe .
I would like to question why his elder brother , Nawaz Sharif , has not taken any action to recover that money as the Prime Minister of the country ? Why did they both invite a corrupt former President for a grand dinner at their residence in Raiwind ? It seems that the brothers have forgotten all the promises of recovering looted wealth made during the time before the elections .

West Baton Rouge Sheriff Mike Cazes swore in Xander Benoit as an honorary deputy after he was killed in a major crash on Interstate 10 last week .
Benoit , 5 , died after being airlifted to a hospital on Thursday , Sept. 28 . The crash totalled multiple cars and severely injured five others when an 18-wheeler plowed through stalled traffic between the Horace Wilkinson Bridge and La . Hwy . 415 , authorities reported .
The 18-wheeler , driven by Yasin Ibrahim , of Burnsville , Minnesota , created a domino effect as cars crashed into each other , driven by the weight of the truck , WBRSO traffic coordinator Lt. Ken Albarez said . Benoit 's mother and an-other passenger were also badly injured in the accident .
All of the victims of the crash became trapped and had to be extracted from their vehicles , Albarez said . The WBRSO received the call shortly after 4 p.m. Albarez said there was “ carnage everywhere ” at the scene .
In all likelihood , Ibrahim “ just did n't realize ” that traffic had slowed .
“ It just comes to an abrupt stop and he just was n't abrupt enough , ” Albarez said . “ You ca n't stop 60,000 pounds . It takes time . ”
Ibrahim was charged with careless operation of a motor vehicle and five counts of negligent injury . He was later charged with negligent homicide after Benoit was pronounced deceased on Thursday .
The 5-year-old had dreams of one day becoming a police officer himself , according to his grandfather , Lee Benoit .
Benoit 's family are well known musicians from Rayne , Louisiana , west of Lafayette . Lee Benoit also said that his grandson 's organs were donated “ so that others in need can live on . ”
His family was overwhelmed with the commission the Sheriff 's Office provided , Albarez said .
The incident marked the sixth crash between the I-10 bridge and West Baton Rouge Parish limits in 2017 , he said . “ Xander is the third person who 's been killed in that stretch of interstate this year . ”
“ Until we get this bridge fixed , until they stop I-10 from being reduced from two lanes to one lane , this is going to continue to happen , ” Albarez told TV reporters on the scene of the crash last week .
Mr. David “ Zac ” Zachariah Holcombe , 20 , passed away on Thursday , April 13 . Mr. Holcombe was born on January 13 , 1997 in Savannah . He worked as a processor for Claxton Poultry and enjoyed cars , four wheelers , painting , hunting , fishing and doing tattoo artistry work .

To witness Les Deuxluxes ' blazing live show is to experience love at first sight , but Les Deuxluxes themselves are — as brassy frontwoman and guitarist Anna Frances Meyer puts it — “ a love story. ” That 's right . The unendingly adorable , always immaculately attired Montréalais blues-rock duo is also a couple . And Meyer and guitarist/drummer Étienne Barry might have left it at that were it not for the fortunate intervention of the Quebec student strike of 2012 , which left Barry — then studying classical piano at McGill University , from whence Meyer also recently graduated with a degree in classical music and opera — with six months off school in a weird limbo where he could n't really commit to a job because classes could start up again at any time . The pair decided busking would be an easy way to make some quick cash . Meyer grabbed her ukulele ; Barry a guitar , and on a lark they headed into the metro tunnels armed with “ the fastest songs we could put together. ” Although decidedly more “ unplugged ” than the fuzzed-out electric Deuxluxes performances of today , the band 's go-for-the-throat attitude toward the stage was there from the beginning , even if the “ stage ” for the first year was a variety of subway stops about Montreal . It was n't quite as easy a way to make money as they 'd hoped , mind you . “ For it to be livable to be a busker you 've got ta do , like , eight hours a day . You 've got ta do it like a real job , ” says Meyer . “ But we 'd get tired in an hour because we just gave too much energy . We were giving the same show that we give now in the metro , acoustic and screaming . So that was bad . ”

Luckily for Les Deuxluxes , an old CEGEP friend of Barry 's chanced across them ripping it up in the underground one afternoon and invited them to play a gig in “ a sh -- -y coke bar ” — memorable for having a claw machine filled with dildos — in Terrebonne , out near Laval , the following weekend .
Montreal rockers Etienne Barry and Anna Frances Meyer , seen at the Tequila Bookworm bar , are Les Deuxluxes , whose raw sound will probably make new fans with their Canadian Music Week show at Supermarket . Rene Johnston / Toronto Star ) Order this photo
That was the first time either of them plugged in , and the first time Barry — who nimbly doubles as drummer while trading guitar licks with Meyer — supplied percussion behind a real drum kit instead of stomping on a trumpet case , yet out of that one show came an invitation to play another gig the following weekend . Since then , says Meyer , “ we 've played every week for the last three years. ” Yeah , Les Deuxluxes are that good .
“ It never stopped . It never stopped , ” says Meyer . “ We became what we are today because we were playing on a stage . We do n't really rehearse . We never had the chance to . It 's crazy . There was nothing planned . There was demand so we took it . People kept asking us to do shows so we just did them and now here we are. ” “ We 'd have school during the week and then we 'd go do shows and then we 'd come back and we 'd never have any break , ” says Barry . “ And we did that for , like , two years — school , shows , school , shows , school , shows — and it ended up that it was our job . We ended up making a bit of a living from it and that 's when it started making sense . We did n't need to find another job . We just needed to have more shows . We just needed to do what we 're doing right now. ” Les Deuxluxes remain something of a well-kept secret from English Canada at the moment , not because they sing in French — Meyer is actually anglophone — but because they 've been able to make a living as a band playing primarily around Quebec . Judging by the response they received during the South by Southwest festival in Austin last month , where Les Deuxluxes were the undisputed scene-stealers at this year 's Canadian Blast barbecue ( “ I do n't think we could have had a better showcase at South by Southwest , ” concedes Meyer ) , they 'll have no problem drawing an audience outside their home province . And now that they have a real label — Bonsound — giving their deliciously fierce debut LP , Springtime Devil , a bit of a push , they should be able to travel a bit more . To that end , the duo plays Supermarket this Thursday , as part of Canadian Music Week . “ There 's no reason why our band should have worked in Quebec , ” marvels Meyer . “ We sing in English . We did n't have access for the longest time to any of the resources that are available to artists in Quebec from the government . Our fan base is francophone . Only now is it starting to become anglophone — like , more Montreal Anglos are coming to our shows . But people who only speak French , they know our lyrics and they sing them at shows all over the province . And that 's so weird , but it 's so cool , too. ” So mixing rock 'n ' roll business with the pleasure of their relationship has been a good thing for Meyer and Barry ? “ Every band is a couple . Every band is a relationship , ” shrugs Meyer . “ The Rolling Stones are f -- -ing married . They are f -- -ing married . They 've been married for 50 years . “ We see our friends who do n't want to tour because they 're away from their loved ones all the time and we do n't have that problem . We are with our loved one . We miss our parents , we miss our friends , but the most important person is there . ”

On Sunday night , on the way to see Flaming Lips at the Colston Hall , the Bristol skies were full of balloons . It was a happy coincidence that the Flaming Lips ' appearance in Bristol coincided with one of the relatively rare successul mass ascents at the Balloon Fiesta , because the marvellous sight of the hot air balloons floating through the skies was a fitting companion to the Flaming Lips – beautiful , ethereal , joyous and a little other-worldly .
Following a brief set from support act Happy Meals , a Glaswegian synthpop duo , although the singer seemed to be singing primarily in French , Flaming Lips strolled on to the stage . It was a surprisingly downbeat casual entrance , especially given what was to quickly follow . The entire hall erupted in flashing lights , swirling clouds of smoke and confetti , and dozens of large latex balls bouncing from floor to ceiling as Race for the Prize kicked proceedings off .
Singer Wayne Coyne is very much the frontman – but the band – keyboard and/or guitarists Steven Drozd , Derek Brown and Jake Ingallis ; bassist Michael Ivins , and drummers Matt Duckworth and Nick Ley – are a formidable ensemble , powerful and at times orchestral , and at times they over power Coyne 's rather frail voice , perhaps due to a pretty bad sound mix .
But every song brought a new visual feast with it , from a huge inflatable robot for Yoshima , Wayne Coyne riding a unicorn through the audience for There Should Be Unicorns , then zorbing over the crowd 's heads for a cover of David Bowie 's Space Oddity , to inflatable rainbows and exploding glitter bursts and dazzling strobe lighting . And all the time the rubber beach balls were bouncing around the auditorium – it quickly became a favourite game up in the balcony to bat about the occasional ball that bounced its way up there , usually just before the security staff could get to it .
The constant distractions and entertainment made it feel like the wildest , most chaotic children 's party you could ever go to , and Wayne Coyne made for an ideal ( if slightly sweary ) children 's entertainer . And as he said , the audience went away feeling like they 'd been living a part of what he called his endless party .
Setlist :
1 . Race for the Prize
2 . Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots , Pt . 1
3 . There Should Be Unicorns
4 . Pompeii Am Götterdämmerung

Amazon is closing down Lovefilm , its DVD rental service in the U.K. and Germany , later this year .
The e-commerce giant said that while streaming is growing at a fast clip , the DVD business is slowing . It employs 50 people at Lovefilm and said that all of these employees would be offered new roles elsewhere within Amazon .
The Lovefilm DVD rental service , which was similar to Netflix 's original business and was acquired by Amazon in 2011 , will shutter on Oct. 31 in both countries , effectively spelling the end of the brand , which does not operate in any other market .
As well as its Prime Video streaming service , Amazon offers OTT channel packages in the U.K. and Germany , which the company launched earlier this year .
“ In the past years , a growing number of customers have made use of streaming services while the demand for renting DVD and Blu-ray discs has declined at the same time , ” Amazon said in a statement out of its office in Germany . “ We will therefore close down the Lovefilm DVD rental service on Oct. 31 , 2017 . We are planning to offer every affected Lovefilm employee another fitting role at Amazon . There are conversations about this happening at the moment . ”
Amazon 's U.K. office added : “ We have very much enjoyed delivering the Lovefilm by post service to our customers . However , over the last few years we 've seen a decreasing demand for DVD and Blu-ray rental as customers increasingly move to streaming . ”
MONTREAL - Alexander Zverev shocked second seed Roger Federer in straight sets in the Montreal Masters final to win his fifth title of the season and announce himself as an emerging star for the US Open . The 20-year-old German used his booming serve to overpower Federer 6-3 , 6-4 Sunday as the Swiss superstar never got a chance to get into the match .
`` I tried to be aggressive as I can , '' said Zverev . `` If Roger starts being aggressive with his forehand and backhand then it is not going to be an easy day for me . '' Zverev avenged a 6-1 , 6-3 loss to Federer in the Halle final in June -- his only loss in a final this season . He is now tied with Federer for the most titles this season at five . `` It 's a wonderful achievement for him , '' Federer said of Zverev . `` I wish him the best for the coming months and hope he can finish the season very strong . I 'm just really happy for him , to see that he 's taking everything not just to the next level , but the two next levels . ''
Zverev blasted six aces and won 80 percent of first serve points as he needed just 68 minutes to dominate the 19-time Grand Slam winner and reigning Wimbledon and Australian Open champion . Zverev hammered away at the 36-year-old Federer with excellent court coverage keeping him off balance throughout the 30 minute opening set . He closed out the set with serve to the backhand that an out of sorts Federer dumped into the ground .
Federer , who was broken three times , looked just as frustrated to open the second set , hitting backhands long and freezing in his tracks as aces whizzed by . Zverev capped his victory on the first match point when Federer hit a forehand long . Federer suffered just his third loss of a season and had his longest win match streak in five years snapped at 16 . Federer , who dropped to 5-1 in finals in 2017 , is undergoing a resurgence this season after it appeared to many he might be slowing down as he transitions through his mid-30s .
But he entered the Montreal event on short notice and has taken more time off this year than usual . He skipped the clay-court season from April to mid-June . He said playing a lot on the hardcourts this week caught up to him on Sunday .
`` I felt all right all week . Had a bit of muscle pain , aches and pains here and there , just because it 's back on the match courts , on the hard courts , '' Federer said . `` After vacation and practice , it 's always a bit of a shock for the body . We 'll have to wait and see now how I feel in the next couple of days . '' Federer will travel to Cincinnati Sunday night for the next tournament then see if he can play back to back events . `` I will take a decision in the next couple of days and see how I feel after five days of playing , if I 'm ready to play in Cincy next week or not , '' he said .
`` Looking ahead to the US Open , obviously I want to be in the best possible shape . Winning my third of the year , my 20th Grand Slam , would be completely insane . I just hope I 'm going to be 100 percent ready when the moment arises . '' Federer was hoping to add another milestone to his memorable season but he failed to post his 94th career title which would have moved him into a tie for second all-time with Ivan Lendl .

BEIJING ( Reuters ) - China will take action to defend its interests if the United States damages trade ties , the Ministry of Commerce said on Tuesday , after U.S. President Donald Trump authorized an inquiry into China 's alleged theft of intellectual property .
Trump 's move , the first direct trade measure by his administration against China , comes at a time of heightened tension over North Korea 's nuclear ambitions , though it is unlikely to prompt near-term change in commercial ties .
U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer will have a year to look into whether to launch a formal investigation of China 's policies on intellectual property , which the White House and U.S. industry groups say are harming U.S. businesses and jobs .
The United States should respect objective facts , act prudently , abide by its World Trade Organization pledges , and not destroy principles of multilateralism , an unidentified spokesman of China 's Ministry of Commerce said in a statement .
`` If the U.S. side ignores the facts , and disrespects multilateral trade principles in taking actions that harms both sides trade interests , China will absolutely not sit by and watch , will inevitably adopt all appropriate measures , and resolutely safeguard China 's lawful rights . ''
The ministry said the United States should `` treasure '' the cooperation and favorable state of China-U.S. trade relations , and warned that any U.S. action to damage ties would `` harm both sides trade relations and companies '' .
China was continuously strengthening its administrative and judicial protections for intellectual property , the ministry added .
China 's policy of forcing foreign companies to turn over technology to Chinese joint venture partners and failure to crack down on intellectual property theft have been longstanding problems for several U.S. administrations .
Trump administration officials have estimated that theft of intellectual property by China could be worth as much as $ 600 billion .
Experts on China trade policy said the long lead time could allow Beijing to discuss some of the issues raised by Washington without being seen to cave to pressure under the threat of reprisals .
China repeatedly rebuffed attempts by previous U.S. administrations to take action on its IP practices , and has insisted it rigorously protects intellectual property .
State news agency Xinhua said the U.S. investigation is a unilateralist `` baring of fangs '' that will hurt both sides .
Jacob Parker , vice president of China operations at the U.S.-China Business Council said Trump 's memo is only the beginning of the process , but that he expected a decision on how to move forward from the administration in 60-90 days .
`` I think it will be much faster than a year , '' Parker said .
Coming to terms on a bilateral investment treaty would be a better way to get China to address the IP issues , he added .
`` This is n't a surprise . Our companies have been honing their crisis communications and internal planning processes since the election . The rhetoric that came up during the campaign led them to take proactive action then . They are prepared , aware and ready for these types of actions going forward . ''
The investigation is likely to cast a shadow over U.S. relations with China , its largest trading partner , just as Trump is asking it to put more pressure on North Korea to give up its nuclear programm .
Trump has suggested he would be more amenable to going easy on China over trade if it were more aggressive in reining in North Korea .
China has said the issues of trade with the United States should not be linked to the North Korea problem .
Ken Jarrett , president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai , said in a statement on Tuesday that trade and North Korea should not be linked , but that the investigation was a `` measured and necessary step '' .
`` The president 's executive order reflects building frustration with Chinese trade and market entry policies , particularly those that pressure American companies to part with technologies and intellectual property in exchange for market access , '' he said .
`` Chinese companies operating in the United States do not face this pressure . ''

Mount Pleasant Police said Monday no threats were ever made to Wando High School after a reported social media post prompted a lockdown on Thursday .
Police say a woman reported seeing a Snapchat video which she says showed people were on campus armed with guns . Police say she said someone in the video threatened her son .
That report prompted a lockdown Thursday afternoon at Wando and nearby schools as police searched for a possible suspect .
`` After review of video evidence and interviews of the original complainant and subject it was determined that no weapons had been brought onto the Wando campus nor had any threats been made , '' police said in a Facebook post .
Police said a school resource officer took the report on Thursday from a woman who said her child had been having an issue with a fellow student .
The officer located the student and spoke to him privately , explaining he received information that his older brother was on campus with other people who had guns .
The student said his brother was not at the school and he did not have any guns . According to the student , his brother came to school to pick up a female who was sick and take her to the hospital .
A police report states the officer had the student call his brother and put him on speaker phone . The brother said he was in downtown at MUSC and offered to re-send a Snapchat .
The officer then asked the brother to resend it so he could see it himself .
Police say the Snapchat was of the brother inside a car , playing rap music with Wando High School in the background .
According to police , the officer told the brother that he needed to speak with him face to face and confirm that he was not at Wando 's campus and that there was no threat .
Investigators say the brother agreed to the officer 's request and told him that he was at MUSC where officers eventually met him .
Police said no charges have been filed in the incident .

Luton Town have confirmed they have sold striker Isaac Vassell to Sky Bet Championship club Birmingham City for an undisclosed fee .
The 23-year-old , who joined the Hatters from National League South side Truro City just over a year ago , has passed a medical and will move to St Andrew 's with immediate effect .
Vassell started his career with Plymouth before being scouted by chief recruitment officer Mick Harford and moved to Kenilworth Road in the summer of 2016 , enjoying a superb second half to the season , finishing with 14 goals in total , including 11 in his final 24 games .
That was enough to alert the attention of Bristol City who saw a bid rejected during pre-season , as he went on to net a brace in the 8-2 win over Yeovil Town on the opening day of the season ,
However , with Vassell out of contract at the end of the campaign , the Hatters have finally agreed to sell the striker to Birmingham , managed by Harry Redknapp , as he leaves the club with 16 goals in total from his 55 appearances .
World experts at International Urban Conference discuss the future of water supply . By Sean O'Toole for GROUNDUP .
First published on GroundUp
Why is Cape Town experiencing a water crisis ? How does one answer that without ignoring history and simplifying the facts ? Should frighten citizens of Cape Town , many now scrambling to become water literate , embrace the call to “ decolonise narratives ” around water governance in order to rescue their city ? Such questions energised debates on the first day of an international conference on urban research at the University of Cape Town .
Hosted by the African Centre for Cities ( ACC ) , the three-day International Urban Conference runs until 3 February with over 70 panels and 16 roundtables to discuss the scale and breadth of African and southern urbanism .
ACC director Edgar Pieterse invited East London-born musician Asanda “ Msaki ” Mvana to warm up the 500 conference delegates from 26 countries . Msaki gave her audience a tutorial in recent campus politics . Her strummed songs of quiet rage were accompanied by visuals registering key moments of the Fallist Movement .
“ I think I should sing a song about the rain , ” said Msaki as she neared the end of her performance .
Water was a recurring theme on the first day . Former director-general of water ( 1997-2005 ) and a commissioner of South Africa 's first National Planning Commission ( 2010-15 ) , Mike Muller , said , “ I have a problem with European perspectives brought to Africa. ” Africa 's urban population will grow by 720 million by 2050 , whereas Europe will only add 36 million new urban citizens , he said . Europe 's green-friendly capitalist solutions do not square with Africa 's needs .
Muller , who is visiting professor at the University of the Witwatersrand 's Graduate School of Governance , criticised his UCT colleagues ' promotion of various forms of water harvesting , some traditional , others like Sponge City in Harbin , China , at the forefront of new innovation .
“ What we ca n't afford in Africa is a bunch of hobby horses introduced , ” said Muller . “ The nature-based argument is a dangerous diversion . ”
Muller 's arguments are based on the belief – forcefully argued in a 2015 article for US journal Science – that built water infrastructure will remain an integral part of socioeconomic development and moderniation . He ended his talk with a slide of the Three Gorges Dam , a hydroelectric gravity dam in China . “ This is the scale of change and thinking we will need for Africa . ”
Patrick Martel , a young environmental scholar from Durban , revisited his hometown 's turbulent water history , referring to key water “ moments ” rather than “ crises ” . These moments – or as architect and UCT senior lecturer Tom Sanya clarified , “ episodic shocks in the system ” – included the ad hoc approach to water capture by early settlers and later the technocratic takeover of water provisioning by national government .
This “ hydro-modernist engineering approach ” to the supply of water ( such as those suggested by Muller ) , Martel said , fitted well with the ambitions of the apartheid state , whose “ bio-politics ” purposefully underwrote the unequal provisioning of water . Race biased rationing endures , notwithstanding the reform and social-justice agenda of post-apartheid governance .
In a panel focussing on water-smart cities , Kirsty Carden , a civil engineer and researcher with UCT 's Future Water institute , argued the case for a hybrid approach to water supply . “ We ca n't rely on one single source of water , ” said Carden . “ Cape Town has been caught out by that , relying only on water from dams . ”
She rejected Muller 's scepticism about harnessing nature as a buffer to the risks and hazards of single sources like dams . “ We need both engineering and bio-solutions , ” she said .
“ The technology is there , ” said Carden . “ We have pilot plants for desalination , which we developed. ” The principle obstacle is financing .
Neil Armitage , a civil engineer who heads UCT 's Urban Water Management research unit , chimed in : “ The issue is one of timing . We hit the perfect storm – without rain . What appeared at the time to be an extremely clever decision – to defer capital expenditure , because there was no need , because the security of water supply looked adequate until 2023 – was met by a one-in-a-thousand-years drought . ”
“ Our risk analysis has not worked , ” he said . “ Basing all our decisions on historical rainfall or data is dangerous . We have to change the paradigm and move to a more resilient city with multiple water sources and built in redundancies . ”
“ No one cares about water until it 's not there , ” said Armitage .
GroundUp asked Armitage and Carden if the Three Gorges Dam was a viable model for a water-smart city ? Our question was met with silence , then much laughter . Armitage described the project as an “ old-fashioned , supply-driven approach ” to water supply , albeit one that offered a quick fix for China 's rapid growth . “ I think they are going to have major headaches in the time to come . But China is already into the next wave of solutions , which they call ecological urbanism . ”
The water crisis has alerted a privileged minority in Cape Town to an enduring fact beyond the city and South Africa . “ It is the urban majority that experience vulnerability , ” said Bangalore-based researcher Gautam Bhan in his keynote address .
Conference delegates were given a mild taste of this precariousness ; delegate packs included a tin canister for water . It was empty . DM

INDIANAPOLIS ( AP )  Newly released federal figures show a sharp rise in child abuse fatalities in the U.S. , with the bulk of the increase occurring in two states  Indiana and Texas  where child-welfare agencies have been in disarray .
According to a report released this week by the Department of Health and Human Services , there were 1,700 fatalities resulting from child maltreatment reported in fiscal year 2016 , compared to 1,589 the previous year  a 7 percent increase . The figures encompass data from every state but Maine , as well as from the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico .
Accounting for most of the increase were Texas , where fatalities jumped from 162 to 217 , and Indiana , where the death toll more than doubled from 34 to 70 . ( Continued below . )

It breaks my heart for the kids in this state right now ,  said Juvenile Judge Marilyn A. Moores , whose Indianapolis courtroom has seen a surge in child welfare cases due to the opioid epidemic .
Traditional systems of early warning are overwhelmed . And parents , because of addiction , arent seeking intervention because their kids are going to be removed ,  she added . It allows kids to die . Its a fact.
Long festering problems in Indianas child welfare system exploded into public view in December , when the director of the Department of Child Services resigned with a scathing letter that accused Republican Gov . Eric Holcomb of making management changes and service cuts that all but ensure children will die.
I choose to resign , rather than be complicit in decreasing the safety , permanency and well-being of children who have nowhere else to turn ,  wrote Mary Beth Bonaventura , a former juvenile judge appointed to lead the agency by then-Gov . Mike Pence in 2013 .
In recent years , the number of child welfare cases in Indiana has skyrocketed , rising from about 13,000 in 2012 to nearly 24,000 last year . Funding , meanwhile , has not kept pace , said Cathy Graham , executive director of the Indiana Association of Resources and Child Advocacy .
Advocates paint a picture of an agency in perpetual triage , with caseworkers spread so thin that they have little choice but to cut corners . The agency does not have enough caseworkers to meet a minimum requirement set in state law and turnover has been a major problem , according to the agencys most recent annual report .
Holcomb launched a review in December . A preliminary report released Thursday found the state has an inadequate case management system .
In Texas , abuse-related fatalities have continued to rise despite high-level personnel changes at the child welfare agency , new legislative appropriations , and a federal judge , Janis Graham Jack , declaring in 2015 that the foster care system violated the constitutional rights of youngsters placed in long-term foster care .
In January , the judge issued her final order in the case , saying the states foster care system remained broken. She also ordered improvements in regards to record keeping and the handling of foster care placements . Texas appealed the ruling .
Two years ago , a commission created by Congress concluded that the United States lacks coherent , effective strategies for reducing the number of children who die each year from abuse and neglect . Although the number of such deaths reported by HHS has hovered at around 1,500 to 1,600 annually in recent years , the commission  citing gaps in how the data is compiled  suggested the actual number may be as high as 3,000 a year .
The commission issued an update this week noting that states across the country were moving to implement some of its recommendations for preventing maltreatment deaths .
The new report released by HHSs Childrens Bureau , formally known as the National Child Abuse and Neglect Data System , does not offer theories explaining the sharp rise in child fatalities , but it provides demographic data on the victims .
According to the report , 70 percent of the victims were younger than 3 . Fatality rates were higher for boys than for girls , and higher for African-American children than for whites and Hispanics .
Parents  acting alone , together or with other individuals  were the perpetrators in 78 percent of the deaths .
Looking more broadly at national trends , the report estimated that 676,000 children were victims of abuse and neglect in 2016 , a 1 percent drop from 2015 . Most of the cases involved neglect ; about 18 percent involved physical abuse  up slightly from 2015 .

PALM BEACH , Fla ( Reuters ) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Saturday that a controversial memo attacking federal law enforcement written by congressional Republicans vindicates him in the investigation of Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election .
Trump 's fervent embrace of the memo raised again the prospect that he may use it as justification to fire special counsel Robert Mueller , who is conducting the investigation , or Deputy Attorney Rod Rosenstein , who oversees Mueller .
Tweeting from his resort in Palm Beach , Florida , Trump said the memo “ totally vindicates ” him but added “ the Russian Witch Hunt goes on and on . Their ( sic ) was no Collusion and there was no Obstruction. ” He called the investigation “ an American disgrace . ”
The White House told Reuters on Friday there would be no changes at the Justice Department as a result of the memo 's conclusions .
The memo , written by Republicans on the U.S. House of Representatives Intelligence Committee chaired by Devin Nunes , argues the federal investigation of potential collusion between Trump 's 2016 presidential campaign and Russia was a product of political bias against Trump at the Federal Bureau of Investigation and Justice Department .
Trump approved the release of the formerly classified memo without redactions , despite objections from the FBI in a move that deepens tension between the White House and senior law enforcement that has existed since Trump first took office .
Democrats contend the four-page memo mischaracterizes highly sensitive classified information and was intended to undermine the Mueller criminal probe that was launched in May 2017 as an outgrowth an earlier FBI investigation .
Jerrold Nadler , the top Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee , said in a statement that Trump 's decision to allow the release of the memo was “ part of a coordinated propaganda effort to discredit , disable and defeat the Russia investigation . ”
Some Republicans also were critical of the memo 's release . John Kasich , the governor of Ohio and a former rival of Trump 's for the presidential nomination , released a statement on Saturday calling it “ a disservice to our country . ”
Asked by reporters on Friday whether the memo made him more likely to fire Rosenstein or whether he had confidence in him , Trump replied , “ You figure it out . ”
Dismissing Rosenstein or Mueller would trigger a political firestorm much like the sacking of FBI Director James Comey by Trump last year .
Mueller also is examining whether Trump has obstructed of justice in trying to thwart the Russia investigation .

QUESTIONS OF AUTHORITY
The memo alleges the FBI concealed the Democratic ties of a source the agency used to justify surveillance on Carter Page , a former Trump campaign adviser with links to Russia . The memo revealed the names of senior FBI and Justice Department officials , including Rosenstein , who it said had signed off the surveillance .
The document was commissioned by Nunes , the Republican chairman of the House intelligence panel . He said it laid bare “ serious violations of the public trust , and the American people have a right to know when officials in crucial institutions are abusing their authority for political purposes . ”
Mueller 's investigation so far has led to guilty pleas by two of Trump 's foreign policy advisers to charges of lying to the FBI , and indictments of former campaign manager Paul Manafort and his business partner Rick Gates .

On Friday , the Justice Department backed Mueller by dismissing a civil suit filed by Manafort claiming Rosenstein had exceeded his legal authority in giving Mueller “ carte blanche . ”
The Republican memo focused on court-approved surveillance of Page and said the FBI used a source who was strongly biased against Trump , former British spy Christopher Steele , to justify the action .
It alleged that a dossier of alleged Trump-Russia contacts compiled by Steele , and funded in part by Democrats , formed an “ essential part ” of requests to a special court to be allowed to conduct electronic surveillance on Page that began in October 2016 .
Despite the memo 's charges , neither the focus on Page nor the FBI 's investigation of Trump-Russia ties began with the Steele dossier .
Page came to the FBI 's attention as early as 2013 , when he met in New York with Russians who were officers of the Kremlin 's foreign intelligence service , sources have said .
The memo acknowledges that the FBI counterintelligence investigation began in July 2016 , three months before the request for electronic surveillance on Page , as a result of the activities of another Trump campaign aide , George Papadopoulos .
Steve Vladeck , a professor of constitutional law at the University of Texas-Austin , said it was unprecedented for the president to feud so publicly with leaders of the U.S. intelligence agencies .
“ You do long-term damage to these institutions if you convince a large swath of the American public that they ca n't be trusted , ” he said .
Rome , July 4 - INPS chief Tito Boeri reiterated on Wednesday his assertion that Italy needs migrant workers for its pension system to be sustainable , adding that perceptions of how many workers from abroad are in the country were off the mark . `` Our pension system is capable of meeting the challenge of longevity , at least as long as the automatic adaptation of the retirement age in relation to life expectancy is kept , '' Boeri said as he presented the pension and social security agency 's annual report . `` But it does not have corrective mechanisms that enable it to compensate for a fall in people arriving on our labour market ... `` The Italians underestimate the percentage of the population that is over 65 and they overestimate the number of immigrants and people under 14 . `` The deviation between perception and reality is much more accentuated that elsewhere . `` It 's not just prejudice . It is full blown disinformation . `` Our country needs to increase legal immigration '' .

In the 15 years since his ruling party came to power , Erdoğan has taken part in 11 elections - five legislative polls , two referenda , three local elections and a presidential vote - and won them all .
On Sunday , Erdoğan claimed victory in his 12t and arguably biggest ballot-box challenge since his ruling Justice and Development Party ( AKP ) came to power in 2002 : a referendum on expanding his powers . Supporters hail the new system as a historic change that will create efficient government but critics say it is a dangerous step towards one-man rule in the NATO member and EU candidate state . Fighting for votes in every corner of the country , Erdoğan kept up a punishing schedule of daily rallies seeking to woo doubters with his indefatigable campaigning .
Prowling around the stage like a rock star , a wireless microphone in his hand , Erdoğan bellows at the crowds : `` Do you want a strong Turkey ? ''
Known to his inner circle as `` beyefendi '' ( sir ) and to admirers as `` reis '' ( the chief ) , Erdoğan is supreme on stage , holding the audience with near-matchless public speaking skills .
'Balancing act '
While Erdoğan is widely seen in Western media as a near-omnipotent sultan , there are constraints to his rule , according to Asli Aydintasbas , senior fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations . To win Sunday 's referendum , Erdoğan had to perform a `` delicate balancing act '' of winning votes from both Kurds and nationalists , she added . And the result was extremely tight with major cities Ankara and Istanbul voting against him .
Erdoğan came to the referendum after the most turbulent year of his political life which saw a slew of terror attacks , worsening relations with Europe and above all a failed coup on July 15 . In a memorable image , he appeared on the FaceTime app on live TV to urge supporters to flood the streets and defeat the coup , saying he escaped being killed by just 15 minutes before returning in triumph to Istanbul . The president has courted ever more controversy as authorities jailed more than 47,000 people under a state of emergency which has lasted nine months so far . There has even been talk of fissures within the AKP and with his two other party co-founders - former president Abdullah Gul and ex deputy prime minister Bulent Arinc - both deafening in their silence by failing to endorse the new system .
'My crazy projects '
With the new constitution likely to come into force after elections in November 2019 , Erdoğan could stay in power until 2029 , by which time the energetic president , 63 , would be 75 .
He seems determined to leave a legacy at least as significant as Turkey 's modern founder Mustafa Kemal Ataturk , whose picture hangs next to his at rallies . He has embarked on a hugely ambitious drive to modernise Turkey 's infrastructure with a new bridge and two tunnels spanning the Bosphorus , high-speed trains and the construction of a third airport for Istanbul - schemes he affectionately refers to as `` my crazy projects '' .
But critics worry of a creeping Islamisation of Turkey 's officially secular society , with a surge in mosque-building , use of Islamic schools and the abolition of all restrictions on the headscarf in public life . Born in Istanbul but brought up by the Black Sea , Erdoğan is intensely proud of rising from humble origins to become Turkey 's most powerful politician since Ataturk . He gained prominence in the nascent Islamic political movements that were starting to challenge secular domination , becoming a popular mayor of Istanbul in 1994 . He was jailed for four months for inciting religious hatred when he recited an Islamist poem , a term which only magnified his profile . Founding the AKP after the previous Islamic party led by his mentor Necmettin Erbakan was banned , Erdoğan spearheaded its 2002 landslide election victory and became premier less than six months later.–AFP
It was in these early days that the AKP , lacking allies , forged an alliance with the movement of US-based preacher Fethullah Gulen that would end with the sides becoming sworn enemies and Gulen blamed for masterminding the coup bid .
Return to pragmatism ?
Protests in 2013 over plans to build a shopping mall on an Istanbul park provided a rallying cause for secular Turks but Erdoğan came out fighting , famously slamming the protesters as `` capulcu '' ( `` hooligans '' ) .
In 2014 , Erdoğan was elected president in the first-ever popular vote for the post and moved into a vast new presidential palace that opponents denounced as an extravagance .
In June 2015 elections , the AKP won the most votes but lost its overall majority for the first time . But Erdoğan swatted away any proposal of a coalition and called new elections in November where the majority was restored .
Some analysts predicted the referendum result could soften the rhetoric of Erdoğan , who enraged European leaders by frequently referring to `` Nazis '' after authorities cancelled 'Yes ' camp rallies . But the first signs suggested that yet another ballot box win had only emboldened the `` chief '' , as he called on foreign powers to respect the result and mooted a referendum on restoring the death penalty - which would sound the death knell for Turkey 's EU bid
After playing a Thursday night gig at Johnny Brenda 's and before heading down I-95 to play D.C. 's Songbyrd Music House , singer-songwriter Sophie Payten — known onstage as Gordi — stoped by World Cafe Live for a Free at Noon concert performance .
Sonically , the Sydney , Australia singer and songwriter manages to exist in numerous stylistic zones simultaneously . After opening on the majestic “ Myriad , ” a simmering spacey synth-driven track , the mood shifted with “ All The Light , ” a poppy , Paula Cole-ish number peppered with samples . After that taste of her forthcoming Reservoir LP , out August 25th , Gordi dove back to her Clever Disguise EP for “ Wanting , ” her acoustic guitar strums providing an organic counterpoint to the drumpad rhythm .
As the set progressed , “ Heaven I Know ” felt very inspired by Frank Ocean and Kanye West with is tasteful use of autotune , while “ So Here We Are ” recalled Lo Moon by way of Peter Gabriel . Gordi 's strength is bridging those worlds of heady atmospheric rock and anthemic , empowering pop , and transforming them too — a feat illustrated impressively in the closing cover of Courtney Barnett 's “ Avant Gardner , ” inverted from a stoner guitar rocker into a heartbreaking minor key piano ballad .

* MSF says it is being threatened by Libya coastguard
* Migration is dominating political agenda in Italy
* MSF refused to sign Rome 's Code of Conduct for NGOs
By Gavin Jones
ROME , Aug 12 ( Reuters ) - Doctors Without Borders ( MSF ) said on Saturday it was suspending its migrant rescues in the Mediterranean because it felt threatened by the Libyan coastguard and the Italian government 's policies have made its job harder .
The aid group 's decision is the latest development in mounting tensions between Rome and NGOs as migration dominates Italy 's political agenda ahead of elections early next year .
`` We are suspending our activities because now we feel that the threatening behaviour by the Libyan coastguard is very serious ... we can not put our colleagues in danger , '' the president of MSF 's Italian arm Loris De Filippi told Reuters .
Almost 600,000 migrants have arrived in Italy over the past four years , the vast majority setting sail from lawless Libya in flimsy vessels operated by people smugglers . More than 13,000 migrants have died trying to make the crossing .
Charity boats have played a growing role in rescues , picking up more than a third of all migrants brought ashore so far this year against less than one percent in 2014 .
However , Italy fears the groups are facilitating people smuggling and encouraging migrants to make the passage , and it has proposed a Code of Conduct governing how they operate .
Some groups , including MSF , have refused to sign the code .
They object to a requirement that Italian police officers be on their boats and that the boats must take migrants to a safe port themselves , rather than transferring them to other vessels to allow smaller boats to stay in the area for further rescues .
MSF operates one rescue ship in the Mediterranean , the Vox Prudence , currently docked in the Sicilian port of Catania .
In the last six weeks the number of migrant arrivals in Italy has slowed sharply and Rome has begun collaborating more closely with the Libyan coastguard , which De Filippi said was threatening the NGOs and preventing them from working .
He said the Libyan coastguard had demanded the NGOs should leave an area of hundreds of kilometres around its coast , whereas previously they had been allowed to conduct search and rescue operations as close as 11 nautical miles to the mainland .
`` Last year the coastguard fired 13 shots on our boat and that was in a situation that was much calmer than the present one , '' said De Filippi .
He said MSF would continue its collaboration with another aid group , SOS Mediterranee , which operates a rescue ship in the Mediterranean with MSF doctors on board .
De Filippi said the Rome government 's Code of Conduct for NGOs and its support for the Libyan coastguard showed it was now mixing the humanitarian goal of saving lives with `` a political and military intention '' of reducing arrivals .
A government spokesman was not immediately available to comment .
Last week Italy began a naval mission in Libyan waters to train and support its coastguard , despite opposition from factions in eastern Libya that oppose the U.N.-backed government based in Tripoli .
General Khalifa Haftar , a commander aligned with an Eastern-based parliament , told Italian daily Corriere della Sera on Saturday the presence of Italian military vessels in Libyan waters was unacceptable but he would not attack them . ( Editing by David Evans )
ISLAMABAD , Jul 4 ( APP ) : Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf ( PTI ) plans to establish a Centralized Knowledge Economy Authority ( CKEA )
with an objective to making Information Technology ( IT ) the top contributor to exports and job creation .
The Authority , having statutory powers for procurement ,
policies and regulations , will be headed by a CIO who would ensure
that a connected and shared eco-system is developed aligned to central
strategy in partnership with industry that can provide basis for
digitalization not currently possible due to isolated and
fragmented approach .
The CIO will also provide expert leadership
and will be from private sector . This is to ensure that
the authority works with a more agile mindset compared to
existing government bureaucracy .
The Party has introduced its official Digital Policy
under a Vision to transform Pakistan into a knowledge economy .
A Digital Policy document has revealed that strategic
guidance will be provided by a committee chaired by
Prime Minister , comprising Cabinet Members and Members
from the industry .
A centrally led hybrid governance model is proposed where
provinces will also appoint CIOs who will be responsible to align
provincial digital policies and programmes with national programme .
A Council comprising CIOs from Federal and Provincial
Governments will be established on sidelines of Council of
Common Interests ( CCI ) and will meet quarterly to review progress
and resolve conflicts/issues .
The document said PTI would leverage technology to
create jobs , increase exports and curb corruption . The party has
set an ambitious target of increasing Pakistan 's IT exports to
US $ 10 billion over the next 5 years .
It has been further proposed that to boost the IT industry
of the country , the Party would focus on National Digital
Transformation Initiative and e-Government and plans to initiate
projects worth US $ 2 billion .
The projects will focus on reducing corruption , providing
services to citizens and creating and enhancing
capacity of the industry . A public-private partnership model will
be employed to execute government projects .
E-government is going to be a core focus of the PTI and
the model will be used to increase transparency . An open
government data policy will be in effect to allow citizens to
audit the government 's performance .
As with any project that aims to increase digitalization , focus will
be placed on data privacy . In addition , projects and policies will be
launched to increase Pakistan 's cybersecurity capacity .

Deloitte says the skills shortage is part of a global problem where the cybersecurity workforce gap is expected to stand at 1.8 million by 2022 . The firm say addressing cybersecurity risks is critical as they could slow the pace of global technological innovation by as much as $ 3 trillion ( USD ) in lost economic value in 2020 . Deloitte says Canadian schools are struggling to keep up with the rapidly evolving field , while also facing competition from industry for qualified instructors .

While the prospects of lifting rural communities out of poverty look good , progress is slowed down by rapid population growth . According to the report , between 2015 and 2030 , the combined population of Africa and Asia is expected to rise from 5.6 billion to more than 6.6 billion . It further states that in sub-Saharan Africa , the number of people aged 15 – 24 years is projected to increase by more than 90 million by 2030 , with the highest rise in rural areas . The large increases in youth population will create a challenge of unemployment in the decades to come . There is low productivity in the industrial sector and agriculture , which means new job seekers will struggle to find employment . As a result , those who migrate from rural areas to the cities will likely add to the growing numbers of the urban poor .
According to the report , rural communities are therefore likely to escape poverty if they remain in rural areas and not move to urban areas . The solution is to drive investment to rural areas and create policies that support small-scale farmers . Currently , smallholder food producers have little to no access to profitable markets and value chains , which are dominated by large producers and retailers . To ensure small-scale farmers meet the food demand both in urban and rural areas , policies need to be introduced that “ reduce the barriers limiting their access to inputs ; foster the adoption of environmentally sustainable approaches and technologies ; increase access to credit and markets ; facilitate farm mechanisation ; revitalize agricultural extension systems ; strengthen land tenure rights ; ensure equity in supply contracts ; and strengthen small-scale producer organisations . ”
While industrial development in sub-Saharan Africa has been slower than other regions , rural transformations can be done by leveraging food systems to meet the growing demand for food in urban areas . The aim is to diversify food systems and create new economic opportunities in off-farm , agriculture-related activities such as trading , processing , packaging , distribution , and storage . The increasing demand coming from urban food markets is expected to be a major driver behind rural transformations . However , while the growing urban food demand creates a “ golden opportunity ” for agriculture , it may also present challenges for smallholder farmers . The extension of small pieces of farmland into larger commercial farms may lead to the exclusion of millions of smallholder farmers from taking advantage of emerging opportunities . To ensure this transformation benefits everyone , especially the most vulnerable , policymakers and governments need to understand the socio-economic links between cities , towns and rural areas and how they influence the food system .

Did “ Natasha , Pierre and the Great Comet of 1812 ” benefit from its recent casting controversy ? The musical was one of the few to report a significant rise at the Broadway box office in a week that saw most individual shows hold fairly steady , but for a new notable exception .
There are a few reasons “ Great Comet ” ( $ 981,664 ) might have jumped 12 % ( more than $ 100,000 ) last week . The show attracted a flurry of publicity following the abortive recasting of Mandy Patinkin in one of the title roles , and all that the attention may have prodded audiences to turn out in support of Okieriete Onaodowan before he exited the show Aug. 13 . Musician Ingrid Michaelson also left the cast that day , which probably added to the bump . And then there 's the fact that last week the production posted a closing notice for Sept. 3 , which might have gotten people to hustle to the theater , too .
According to one of the show 's creators , advance sales for the coming weeks had been pretty dire , which was the reason Patinkin was recruited in the first place . Whether the closing notice will help keep numbers elevated remains to be seen .
The rise at “ Great Comet ” was the one of the biggest of the week . Gloria Estefan bio-musical “ On Your Feet ! ” ( $ 1,054,473 ) got an 18 % bump , fueled by theatergoers catching the show before it shutters Aug. 20 , while “ Wicked ” ( $ 2,066,330 for nine ) stepped up with an extra performance to bring in hot-weather tourists . “ Groundhog Day ” ( $ 703,896 ) , meanwhile , got a nice lift in the same week that Bill Murray attended the show — twice in a row .
There was only one notable decline , and that was the doozy at “ Kinky Boots ” ( $ 805,897 ) , off 52 % following the departure of Brendon Urie , the frontman of band Panic ! at the Disco . Urie 's casting was , like Sara Bareilles ' turn in “ Waitress , ” one of the most successful star recastings on Broadway this season , helping revive sales at a show that had seen numbers begin to flag .
In a week that accommodated press performances and a heavily comped opening night , Michael Moore 's “ The Terms of My Surrender ” ( $ 407,527 ) downticked , as might be expected , while previewing “ Prince of Broadway ” ( $ 310,279 ) worked up to its first full week of eight previews .
Overall Broadway sales slipped by $ 1.1 million to $ 30.3 million for 30 shows now playing . Attendance also was off a notch , down to 260,456 or 88 % of overall capacity .
OTTAWA , Feb 2 ( Reuters ) - Canadian job growth in 2017 was revised slightly higher , data from Statistics Canada showed on Friday , confirming a stellar year for the country 's labor market , though economists expect the rampant pace of employment will soon start to moderate .
From December 2016 to December 2017 , the economy created 427,300 jobs on a seasonally-adjusted basis , the annual revision showed . That was modestly higher than the initially reported increase of 422,500 jobs .
The 2.3 percent gain over the course of last year was the fastest job growth since 2002 , the agency said .
The acceleration in employment , as well as unexpectedly strong economic growth in the first half of 2017 , has prompted the Bank of Canada to raise interest rates three times since last July , and many economists expect two more hikes this year .
December 's unemployment rate was revised slightly higher to 5.8 percent from 5.7 percent , while December 's monthly employment change was downwardly revised to 64,800 from 78,600 .
Nonetheless , the revisions still indicate a very strong labor market that continued to improve in the second half of last year despite slower economic growth , said Paul Ferley , assistant chief economist at Royal Bank of Canada .
While Ferley expects job growth to start to cool with the January report released next Friday , he said the low unemployment rate should still be enough to keep the Bank of Canada on a tightening path , even with the ongoing uncertainty over the fate of the North American Free Trade Agreement .
“ With the kind of momentum that we 're seeing , you become more confident that the economy might be able to withstand some negative hits and , as a result , you really do n't need rates as accommodative as they are right now , ” Ferley said . ( Reporting by Leah Schnurr ; Editing by Paul Simao )
Abraham Lincoln is remembered for leading during the Civil War , freeing the nation 's slaves , founding land grant colleges and becoming the first commander in chief assassinated in office .
Given all that , perhaps there just is n't room in the country 's collective memory to recall his seminal role in creating the country 's most despised and vilified government agency : The Internal Revenue Service .
It was 1861 . Lincoln was in a financial bind . Also , he was in a war . To raise money to fight the Confederacy , Lincoln pushed for and won passage of an income tax and , a year or so later , established the Internal Revenue Bureau to collect what was owed .
Though Lincoln 's tax was struck down by the Supreme Court in 1895 – the 16th Amendment , passed in 1913 , created the income tax we endure today – historians and legal scholars credit the 16th president , a moderate Republican , with laying the foundation for progressive taxation enforced by the tax man .
These days , the people who know that wield it as political artillery .
What almost nobody remembers is how the New York Times ' editorial page , derided by President Donald Trump and other modern-day Republicans , supported Lincoln and the income tax , particularly because the rich owed more .
People with incomes of less than $ 600 paid nothing . People who made more than $ 600 but less than $ 10,000 paid a 3 percent tax . Those with incomes above $ 10,000 paid a 5 percent tax . Luxury taxes were also imposed on tobacco , whiskey , cattle stock and other material and consumption desires of the wealthy . ( Proposed taxes on watches , pianos and dogs were eliminated before passage of the income tax law . )
Editorial writers at the Times seemed pleased .
`` The income taxes are so framed as to place the heaviest burthen upon that portion of the people who have the largest material stake in the country and the nearest interest in the integrity , public faith and lasting stability of the Government ; the men of money and of productive stocks and other income paying securities , '' the Times wrote on March 4 , 1862 , using grammar and spelling that no longer make sense .

The Times also noted that an income tax would encourage citizens ( at least the male ones ) to be less tolerant of government corruption , perhaps laying the foundation for the investigative reporting that sprang up in newspapers after the Civil War .
`` When every man in the community – every man in the United States – finds he must put his hands into his pocket and draw out a portion of his hard-earned gold and silver to deliver to a Government agent , he will not be indifferent any longer to how that money goes , '' the Times wrote . `` If it is stolen by the Collector , or squandered by Congress through lobby legislation , or sequestered by Cabinet officers through nepotism in contracts , the people who have paid will know it , and they will know how to punish . ''
The Times were not totally in the tank for taxes , though . For one thing , the editorial page opposed taxes on newspapers . `` It is certainly remarkable that republican American should impose a tax upon newspapers , the great educators in modern times , '' the paper said . That seems fairly self-centered until reading what else the newspaper opposed , such as taxes on locomotion .
`` Social intercourse between people composing a nation is essential to domestic harmony , '' an editorial said . `` To Southern soldiers captured on the battle field , the Northerners are simply monsters . The moment the two mingle , they can not possibly see what they are fighting for . People living at a distance are always , in imagination , enemies of each other . ''
Wishful thinking . Thanks , Abe .
US Open champion Stephens in good form at French Open
US Open champion Stephens in good form at French Open
Associated Press NEWS News 31 May 2018 , 01:45 IST 24 Share Options × Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Reddit Google+ Email
PARIS ( AP ) — Sloane Stephens has dropped only six games in her first two matches at the French Open .
Those victories have impressed former U.S. Davis Cup captain Patrick McEnroe , who now believes the reigning U.S. Open champion can claim a second Grand Slam title at Roland Garros .
`` Just FYI . Sloane Stephens is winning this tournament , '' McEnroe tweeted after Stephens dispatched qualifier Magdalena Frech 6-2 , 6-2 in just over an hour on Wednesday .
The 10th-seeded American player , who never got past the fourth round in her six previous appearances at the tournament , is more cautious . She missed the tournament last year and went through a stretch of poor results after winning at Flushing Meadows . She knows getting carried away would be a big mistake .
`` That 's so sweet , that was nice of him , '' Stephens said about McEnroe 's tweet . `` I mean , I ca n't predict the future , I do n't know . I would love to . We 'll see next Saturday . ''
There is a very long way to go for Stephens , who has yet to meet top contenders in Paris . She will face a more serious test in the third round against Camila Giorgi of Italy , who has lost only eight games in the first two matches .
Giorgi has beaten Stephens twice in their three meetings , including a 6-3 , 6-0 rout in Sidney this year on hard court . Stephens does not give too much importance to that result , though , as it came during her post-U.S. Open struggles following a knee injury .
`` I was coming out of an injury and tried to get my season started , '' she said .
After winning in New York , Stephens did not win a match for the rest of the season . She was beaten in the first round at the Australian Open in January and struggled with her tennis until March when she won the title in Miami .
So for now in Paris , Stephens is just happy to `` feel good . ''
As for McEnroe 's prediction , just wait and see .

MOUNT COBB — Dunmore 's John Barone worked hard to improve his short game over the summer .
Those tools came in handy at the end of Sunday 's Lackawanna County Amateur .
Heading back to Philadelphia after the final round , the Temple University senior made his swan song one to remember as he made a pair of clutch two-putts in the final three holes to win his first amateur title by two strokes over David Mecca and Sebastian Cimoch .
“ Short game has kind of been my thing this year , for sure , ” said Barone , who shot back-to-back 70s to finish at 4-under par . “ I 've put some time into it . A lot of time into it .
“ I think I 've earned the right to putt well . I have confidence and I 'm making a lot of putts . And that 's how you shoot low numbers . ”
Barone was sailing along with a two-shot lead through 27 holes when Mecca , playing a group ahead of him , began a charge that saw him make five birdies in an eight-hole stretch , beginning with No . 6 .
“ I was just making putts early in the front nine , ” Mecca said . “ Nos . 6 and 7 , I made good putts . ”
His last birdie at No . 13 pulled him even with Barone , but his tee shot on No . 14 found trouble and led to bogey . He was unable to recapture the magic .
“ The last four or five holes are always tough for me , ” Mecca said . “ Little nerves on the tee shot , knowing that I was tied with John . I put it in the bunker , hit a good chip and putt . It just did n't break .
“ I hit a lot of good putts down the stretch , but only the par ones went in . ”
The tie was short lived . While Mecca was making bogey , Barone drained his sixth and final birdie of the day , a 10-footer that put him three in front of Cimoch .
The Marywood University freshman mounted his own charge with one terrific swing , stuffing his approach shot on the diabolical , uphill 16th hole a foot behind the pin for a tap-in birdie .
When Barone missed the green left and above the hole , the champion was tested and after coming up 15 feet short on his chip , nearly holed the slippery downhill putt for par , tapping in for bogey to maintain a one-stroke lead .
“ I figured I still had a chance to make a good little comeback , ” Cimoch said . “ I think I was one back after that , but he just outplayed me . He 's a good player . ”
Cimoch 's tee shot missed the green right on the 210-yard par 3 , but Barone 's was dead in the center of the green .
Still , he faced an uphill , 55-footer with a sweeping left to right break .
No problem for someone who has worked to refine his stroke as Barone has .
“ I practice my putting all summer and I was confident in my ability to get the ball in the hole in two strokes , ” Barone said . “ I just trusted my game .
“ I knew if I made par on 17 , that was going to be a good score on that hole . ”
He lagged his approach putt within 2 feet and calmly sank it to move two ahead .
Barone split the middle of the fairway with a 320-yard tee shot on No . 18 , knocked a wedge to 8 feet and lipped out the final birdie putt .
“ It 's kind of like winning in your hometown , ” Barone said . “ It feels good to win . Like I 've said , you do n't get wins too often in golf .
“ I 'm having one of the best summers of my life , I 'm playing good golf right now . Going into my senior year at Temple , I 'm looking forward to keeping the good play going . ”
Mecca shot the best round of the day , a 3-under 69 to finish at 142 , same as Cimoch , who carded consecutive 71s for his 2-under score .

Last month , Simon Kuper wrote in his Financial Times column that he was applying for French citizenship . His wife and children , Americans all , had already done so . They live in Paris , so they are not leaving one country for another , but the column made me wonder if I could ever do anything similar . The quick answer is no , but Donald Trump has put my relationship with my own country on the rocks . Some days I think I do n't know it anymore .
Trump 's reaction Saturday to the Charlottesville hate-fest is an example of what I find so troubling . I never thought a president of the United States would hedge his bets when it comes to denouncing racists and anti-Semites . There is abundant boilerplate for these incidents , whole attics of cliches , but Trump could utter not a one . Instead , he pushed out some mush about an `` egregious display of hatred , bigotry and violence on many sides . ''
On Monday , the president toughened-up . `` Racism is evil , '' Trump said , no doubt at the urging of his aides . He denounced `` the KKK , neo-Nazis , white supremacists and other hate groups that are repugnant to everything we hold dear as Americans . '' Nice try , but three days late and many dollars short . The stain of the original statement can not be removed . It is the authentic Trump - the genuine embodiment of a president who has both identified a rage in part of the American electorate and has validated it .
America has had these moments before . The reign of Sen. Joseph McCarthy comes to mind . He was a lying opportunist who exploited a Red Scare to ruin lives and careers . But for all his villainy , he was just a senator and , in due course , the Senate took care of its own . It censured McCarthy .
Trump , however , is vastly more powerful . His tweets dominate the news cycle . His claim that 3 million to 5 million illegal immigrants voted for Hillary Clinton and deprived him of a popular vote victory has seeped into the Republican electorate . The Washington Post last week reported that about half of Republicans would support postponing the 2020 presidential election until the problem is fixed .
That the problem can not be fixed because it does not exist is almost beside the point . More important is the blatant disregard for both the Constitution and tradition . We hold presidential elections every four years . Always have . The president 's term is set by the Constitution . Look it up .
Simultaneous with the delegitimization of the electoral process has come a subversion of truth . It has been reduced to just another thing - something like an alternative to the `` alternative facts '' of Kellyanne Conway 's invention . Trump 's incessant attacks on the press have taken a toll . The so-called mainstream media has for years been a GOP whipping boy , but now it is not merely in opposition , it is corrupt . `` They 're lying , they 're cheating , they 're stealing , '' Trump said during a rally last October in Grand Junction , Colorado . `` They 're doing everything , these people right back here . '' He was pointing to the press section .
Grand Junction , in fact , is where Peter Hessler of The New Yorker found that Trump 's message of anger and intolerance has not only taken hold , it has metastasized . The local GOP , always conservative , was nonetheless taken over by even more conservative Trump supporters . The local newspaper , the reliably middle-of-the road Daily Sentinel , has lost subscribers and is under siege for its moderation . Grand Junction has its problems and it is not all of America . But it ai n't anywhere else , either .
Beliefs that used to be found only on the fringe of the far right have entered the Republican mainstream . The furious and unbalanced hatred of Hillary Clinton , the conviction that the election was almost stolen - all this and more have been given such legitimacy by Trump that neo-Nazis can march in Thomas Jefferson 's hometown , confident that they have Trump 's support . They were wrong . They only had his indifference .
The ultimate question is whether the name Donald Trump will be attached to an era - whether he will so change America that it will never be the same afterward . The answer , I think , lies with members of the president 's own party , Republicans who so far have been loath to confront the president .
Maybe Charlottesville will be a turning point . Maybe the death of counter-protester Heather Heyer will produce the realization that she may not be the last to be killed by hate . Others may follow because the president of the United States winks at hatred and responds to a hate march with a pudding of a statement . It was not what he initially said , though , that was telling . It was his total lack of outrage . Maybe that 's his America . It 's not mine .
It is the most non-traditional of major curling events .
Curlers are learning to embrace it ; fans enjoy it and London has just landed it .
The World Financial Group Continental Cup will be held at Western Fair Sports Centre Jan. 11 through 14 in 2018 .
The event will be used by some of the top curlers in the world in preparation for the 2108 Winter Olympics in PyeongChang , South Korea .
The announcement was made Tuesday at the Sports Centre and given the history of London holding successful major curling events , the excitement of bringing yet another of those events to the Forest City was obvious .
“ It will rank up there with the ( Scott 's Tournament of Hearts ) and the Brier , ” said London 's Peter Inch , chair of Curling Canada 's board of governors . “ This is a different event . It 's like the Ryder Cup of curling . It is n't just men . It is n't just women ; it 's both . We get the best of both teams , also the best of the world 's ( players . ) This will be the first time London sees the best world players . ”
The Continental Cup is a competition between Team North America and Team World over three competitions ; the traditional team games , mixed doubles and , like golf , skins . Point values are assessed to each match .
This year 's event was just held in Las Vegas .
The other noticeable difference in the competition is the crowd activity . Like stadium golf , this event encourages loud and boisterous crowds .
It 's one of the reasons the event is being held at Western Fair rather than Budweiser Gardens where the Scotties and Brier were held previously .
“ You are going to be right on top of the players which we like , ” Inch said . “ We want this noisy . We do n't want a quiet arena . We want it loud , bells , everything happening so the players feel they are in that atmosphere . We believe the Western Fair District makes that atmosphere work for us . ”
Each side has three men 's and three women 's teams . The winning side receives $ 52,000 while the losing side gets $ 26,000 . The side that generates the highest points total from the six skins ' games will receive an additional $ 13,000 .
It 's also an event that gets a lot of air time on sports networks . TSN will air a guaranteed 28 hours of the event .
The high quality of curling will be guaranteed by the selection process used to pick the participants of the event , the 14th Continental Cup .
Team North America will be Canada 's Winter Olympic men 's and women 's team . The other two Canadian teams will be the winners of the 2017 Scotties and the 2017 Briers .
USA Curling will add a men 's and women 's entry to Team North America at a later date .
“ I 'm excited , ” Inch said . “ I was the hardest one who could n't say anything . I wanted to spread the word and let 's get going . I 'll still be on the board of Curling Canada so I ca n't volunteer for this but I will be the loudest one out there spreading the word about this event . ”
Veteran , well-known curler Ted Smith is the co-chair of the event . Even though some of the “ purists ” are n't completely sold , Smith is looking forward to it .
“ I 've never tried it , ” he said . “ I 've just tried the traditional game but mixed doubles is going into the Olympics . I think it 's a great event and it 's catching on . It 's just going to take a little time . ”
London has held several high profile events and the success those events have achieved is one reason Curling Canada keeps coming back .
“ The sponsors always seem to be there ; the ticket sales always seem to be there the volunteers always seem to be there , ” Inch said . “ In a lot of places we are seeing the first two happen but have trouble with the third thing . We 've never had trouble with that in London . ”
Smith said the bid was put together through the joint efforts of the London , Ilderton and St. Thomas Curling Clubs along with the Highland Golf and Curling Club .
He also said that most of the volunteers that were involved in previous high profile curling events are involved in this one and it helped in landing the bid .
“ Many of us have been around so they know it 's not new people and they have an idea what we can offer , ” Smith said .
Tiger Shroff and Disha Patani have often been spotted at various places in town sparking rumours about an alleged relationship . Well , whether or not they come out in open about the alleged affair , here 's some good news for their fans .
After ‘ Munna Michael ' , Tiger is back to packing some punches and throwing some kicks with his next ‘ Baaghi 2 ' with Disha by his side . The actress , who is quite active on Instagram took to the photo sharing app and posted a picture of the cast and crew of ‘ Baaghi 2 ' with the caption , “ Getting ready for a new journey # Baaghi2 @ nadiadwalagrandson @ wardakhannadiadwala @ tigerjackieshroff @ khan_ahmedasas @ shairaahmedkhan # sajidnadiadwala ”
While the prequel to the film was directed by Sabbir Khan , this project would mark Tiger 's first venture with choreographer-filmmaker Ahmed Khan .
Marine Jacob Dalton Stanley was ready for his high school commencement when he was informed that he would not be permitted to walk across the stage . Why ? Because he wanted to receive his diploma in his official military dress blues .
The Indiana high school student graduated early in December 2016 and had graduated from Marine boot training camp in May . Stanley flew back to his high school for graduation — only to be told by Crown Point High School principal Chip Pettit that he must wear the traditional cap and gown .
Pettit said in an email to the Northwest Indiana Times that the school respects the Marine 's service , but honors the traditional cap and gown attire .
USA TODAY College reached out to Chip Pettit to follow up , but did not receive a reply .
Pettit told the Northwest Indiana Times that restricting graduates ' attire to the traditional cap and gown “ is not intended to be disrespectful to students , parents , or our community , but as a source of pride for our students. ” He added , “ It is also not intended to be disrespectful to our students choosing to serve in the military , our active duty servicemen and women and our veterans . We are forever grateful for the sacrifices that they make on a daily basis for our freedom . ”
Stanley declined an interview for this story , but put out a statement through the 9th Marine Corps District Naval Station Great Lakes to USA TODAY College : “ I do n't want the social media controversy that is drawing attention away from the Class of 2017 . I also do not want to make any additional statements and wish to put this all behind me so I can start my career in the Marine Corps . ”
Stanley is far from the only member of military who has tried to wear a dress uniform to a graduation ceremony — only to be told sorry , no , you ca n't do that .
Some of these graduates have expressed their frustration on social media .
“ It sucks that I ca n't wear the sash at graduation , but I 'm going to respect what the school district tell me because it 's what the Coast Guard would want me to do , ” El Dorado High School graduate Andrew Kobly told USA TODAY College in a Twitter message .
The Coast Guard gave Kobly a blue sash to wear at graduation , but he was barred from wearing it by the Placentia-Yorba Linda Unified School District in California .
I received a sash from the Coast Guard for graduation and the PYLUSD wo n't allow me to wear it please like and rt my post to spread the word pic.twitter.com/OJbCYNrbJX — Ron Swanson ( @ drew_kobly ) June 8 , 2017
“ At the beginning of each high school graduation ceremony , the Placentia-Yorba Linda Unified School District Board of Education designates time to exclusively recognize graduating seniors who have committed to serving the country in a branch of the military , ” media and public relations specialist Alyssa Griffiths told USA TODAY College in an email .
During the ceremony , armed forces graduates receive a Challenge Coin with the U.S. Department of Defense official seal and the Placentia-Yorba Linda Unified School District emblem that reads , “ PYLUSD Thanks You for Your Service and Commitment , ” Griffiths said . “ For years , this segment of each PYLUSD high school graduation ceremony has offered a powerful tribute to honor those students dedicated to serving in the United States Armed Forces . ”
Some say that the uniform detracts from the unified whole of the graduating class , and that there 's a time and place for a military uniform — but a school graduation is n't one .
While the Marine Corps does not have a governing policy regarding attire at high school graduations , the American Council on Education has recommended guidelines set forth for college graduates receiving their bachelor , master and doctoral degrees .
Currently , California , Pennsylvania , New Jersey and New Hampshire have laws that allow high school graduates who have completed military boot camp to wear their dress blues to graduation .
The California law states that “ a student who has fulfilled all graduation requirements and completed basic military training to wear the appropriate military dress uniform instead of a traditional cap and gown to his or her high school graduation ceremony . ”
Yet Harland Fletcher , a private first class reservist in the U.S. Army who wanted to walk in his uniform to graduate from Liberty Union High School in California , was informed that he would not be able to receive his diploma at the ceremony , and instead would be able to retrieve it Monday after graduation .
According to the California Education Code , “ Chapter 296 supersedes any local or school policy prescribing what constitutes proper graduation dress and grants graduates who are active members of the military the right to wear their dress uniforms at their graduation ceremonies regardless of any contrary policy . ”
Once district superintendent Eric Volta reviewed the law , he issued an apology to Fletcher through KTVU : “ I apologize to Harland for this unfortunate incident and thank him for his service to our country. ” Fletcher received his diploma in a private ceremony .
New Hampshire 's rule , nicknamed Brandon 's Law , passed in the house 292-12 in May 2016 . Then-New Hampshire Governor Maggie Hassan said she signed Brandon 's Law to honor Brandon Garabrant , who died serving the country overseas . When Garabrant graduated , he was prohibited from wearing his dress blues at graduation .
“ [ It is a ] fitting way to ensure that others like Brandon will have the opportunity to demonstrate their pride in their country and in their service during one of life 's milestones . I was proud to sign this bipartisan bill into law , ” she said to USA TODAY College in an emailed statement .
But the same month Brandon 's Law was passed , an Illinois high school graduate chose not to walk at graduation after the school said she could n't wear her uniform .
The graduate , Pvt . Megan Howerton , was denied the chance to walk across the stage at her graduation from McHenry West High School in Illinois , sparking a conversation on Twitter with the hashtag # letmeganwalk .
If you want the class the graduate as a unit with no individuality there should n't be honors or a valedictorian either # letmeganwalk — Heather Cooper ( @ hcooper84 ) May 25 , 2016
@ MCHS156 # LetMeganWalk She serves our country and should be allowed to march with the honor she deserves ! Give that lady a parade # Freedom — Southern Lady ( @ Souther16313476 ) May 24 , 2016
Still , some people agreed with the high school 's decision to deny her walk at graduation .
@ MCHS156 As a Marine , she should understand protocol . Glad you enforced your rules . # letmeganwalk # retiredUSAF — Stephanie Smith ( @ steph_lynn0401 ) May 24 , 2016
# nohate but I am with folks saying she should have worn her cap and gown , it 's high school graduation not Military Graduation # letmeganwalk — Andrew Sanchez ( @ truckershorizon ) May 24 , 2016
Still , some schools in states without explicit legal guidance do allow student graduates of the armed forces to wear their dress blues in recognition of their service .
The superintendent at the School City of Hobart who allowed First Private Ana Kritikos to walk in her dress blues , Peggy Buffington , said to the Northwest Indiana Times , “ We recognize audience members and future military in our graduates by having them stand . It is always a very special and patriotic moment where the audience roars with applause . ”
And then there 's Michael Joy , a 2016 graduate of Prospect Mountain High School in New Hamsphire , who decided to hide his military uniform underneath his gown because he did n't want to distinguish himself from his classmates .
“ I did n't want to make myself like , ‘ Oh , I 'm better than you guys , ' ” Joy told the Seattle Times . “ It could be an opportunity to celebrate patriotism and stuff . But I feel like joining and actually serving , that is my way of showing patriotism . I do n't have to wear the uniform to show people that I 'm in the service . ”

FLORHAM PARK , N.J. -- At the end of last season , Leonard Williams said his goal was to become a team leader for the New York Jets . He shared that sentiment with his girlfriend 's father , who played a little football in his day . He suggested to Williams that he enroll in a leadership program , just as he did early in his own career .
Williams did , and Hailey Lott 's dad -- the great Ronnie Lott -- approved .
`` I applaud him , '' the Pro Football Hall of Famer told ESPN on Tuesday . `` Most athletes are consumed by themselves , not consumed by trying to help others . He wants to get excited about trying to find ways to make the team better , not just himself . ''
Williams signed up for five weekend seminars at the Ascension Leadership Academy in San Diego , where he 's learning personal development with an emphasis on leadership . He 'll head back to San Diego at the end of the month to complete the curriculum .
Leonard Williams , left , is going above and beyond to become a leader on a Jets team that got a lot younger this offseason . Kelley L Cox/USA TODAY Sports
More than ever , the Jets need a few good leaders . They stripped down their roster this offseason , jettisoning veterans such as David Harris , Eric Decker , Nick Mangold , Brandon Marshall and Darrelle Revis . There 's a leadership void in the locker room , and they 're counting on Williams to become the face of the defense , a unit still reeling from Harris ' abrupt release .
`` Even before David was gone , I was ready to step into a leadership role and give back to the team as much as possible , '' Williams said Tuesday at minicamp . `` I want to bring up some of the younger guys and show more involvement as a leader . ''
Williams is the best player on the team , and he still has n't celebrated his 23rd birthday . ( That happens June 23 . ) Right now , he 's a one-man foundation , looking to get better on and off the field at ALA .
`` I 've learned that it 's all a mindset , '' he said . `` I kind of already knew that , but they harp on it a lot . Anything you think is possible , you can make possible . ''
When Lott sensed Williams was serious about this leadership thing , he suggested that he go all-in . Lott , who finished his career with the Jets in 1994 , was a respected leader on four Super Bowl championship teams with the San Francisco 49ers . He was a star at USC , as was Williams . They met through their Trojans connections and developed a strong friendship .
Just recently , Lott , Williams and USC legend Marcus Allen -- another Hall of Famer -- had a three-way phone conversation . Williams is one lucky dude ; what player would n't love to have Hall of Fame advisers a phone call away ?
`` Marcus told him , 'We do n't expect you to be good , we expect you to be the best that ever played , ' '' Lott said .
Lott believes Williams has unlimited potential .
`` You want to have a player where , every time he lines up , the opponent is afraid of him and fears him , '' Lott said . `` You want that guy . I think he has the capability of being like a J.J. Watt or Jadeveon Clowney . For him , I just hope he gets to a point where he thinks he 's the best in the league . ''
It 's a credit to Williams that he wants to be a well-rounded player , not a diva absorbed with his own greatness . That 's why he signed up for personal enrichment .
`` When you 're there , it 's not just athletes , '' he said . `` It 's everyday people , business people . You really learn a lot from each other and learn about your past and what holds you back . It 's really cool .
`` It helps me go to work every day with a purpose . Sometimes when you 're in camp , you do the same thing every day and you feel like you 're going through the motions . This helps me wake up in the morning with set intentions every day . ''
His popularity soared 11 days ago , when a video posted on Twitter showed him forcibly removing teammate Darron Lee from an apparent dispute with a woman at a music festival in New York . Both players declined to discuss the incident , which is being investigated by the NFL . His silence notwithstanding , Williams showed a take-charge attitude .
The Jets need that , especially without Harris .
`` He passed down a lot of stuff to me , '' Williams said , `` and I 'm going to try to pass it down to the younger guys as well . ''

ISLAMABAD - The Supreme Court on Tuesday rejected a bail plea of Khalid Lango , former finance adviser to chief minister of Balochistan , saying detailed judgment for delay in filing reference against him ( Lango ) would be announced later on .
The National Accountability Bureau ( NAB ) had raided the house of Balochsitan Finance Secretary , Mushatq Raisani , in May 2016 and recovered Rs650 million , foreign currency and prize bonds worth millions of rupees besides 2kg of gold .
Justice Qazi Faez Isa asked NAB Chairman Qamar Zaman Chaudhry that the Bureau has launched a media campaign with logo ‘ Say No to Corruption ' but NAB itself infested with corruption therefore it should say ‘ Yes to Corruption ' .
A three-member bench , headed by Justice Dost Muhammad Khan and comprising Justice Qazi Faiz Isa and Justice Maqbool Baqir , was hearing the bail application of Khalid Lango . The court questioned as to why the NAB had not filed reference against the accused so far .
Prosecutor General NAB Waqas Qadeer Dar tried to explain reasons . However , the court expressing dissatisfaction asked the PG NAB to take his seat and called the chairman NAB to rostrum .
The chairman also failed to justify delay in filing a reference against Lango . He , however , said that the reference could not be filed as Raisani 's application for plea bargain was pending before the NAB court .
Justice Qazi Faez said in the country 's history , a unique and important case came with the NAB wherein it had raided the house and arrested the accused red-handed with a billion of rupees , adding the anti-graft agency instead to play its active role entered into a plea bargain with the accused . “ We are answerable to the tax-payers and protectors of the money of tax-payers , ” the judge said . He questioned as to whether Chairman NAB should not be made accountable for this .
Justice Dost observed that the courts have passed judgments where the investigating authorities failed to come up to the people 's expectations .
“ Show us any law or precedent if available in this regard whereby a reference can not be filed if a mater is pending with the NAB court , ” Justice Qazi Faiz Isa asked chairman NAB .
The chairman NAB simply said that he was bound to the counselling of his chief legal advisor .
When Justice Isa asked him to show that he had been consulted . The chairman again failed to satisfy the court but said as he was advised by the Director General NAB Balochistan to inter into a plea bargain with the accused hence he accepted the application for plea bargain . “ It means you give preference to the view of your subordinates instead of applying your own mind , ” Justice Dost asked the chairman NAB , adding may be his subordinates had entered into a deal with the accused under the table .
The whole burden is now on you and being a head of the Bureau , you are not bound to listen to the views of juniors , Justice Dost said . “ We know you are a big personality but you are also not above the law , ” Justice Isa .
During the proceeding , Farooq H Naek , Counsel for Khlaid Lango , submitted that his client was seriously ill , adding NAB has so far no record that could establish that his client was involved in this case . He said there were examples that people on the basis of health problem got bail . He said Shahbaz Sharif also got bail on this ground .
Justice Dost said former President ( Pervez Musharraf ) also went abroad on health issue . He advised him to go ‘ Bari Imam ' and distribute food among the destitute . The counsel contended that the NAB after entering into a plea bargain with Mushtaq Raesani will try to make him approver in the matter and may net his client .

South Korean parties on Wednesday expressed concerns over the apparent assassination of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un 's half brother , urging the government to keep vigilant on possible provocations by the North .
Sources said Kim Jong-nam , the 45-year-old eldest son of late North Korean leader Kim Jong-il , was killed after being poisoned in Malaysia on Monday .
This undated file photo shows North Korean leader Kim Jong-un 's half brother Kim Jong-nam . ( For Use Only in the Republic of Korea . No Redistribution ) ( Yonhap )
`` The event explicitly showed the tragic reality of Kim Jong-un 's reign of terror , '' said Rep. Kim Myung-yeon , a spokesman of the ruling Liberty Korea Party . `` It has increased the possibility that Kim will seek abrupt provocations against South Korea and the international community to maintain his regime . `` The ruling party said South Korea 's government and military should take a closer look at Pyongyang and bolster security measures while working closely together with other countries to better cope with possible provocations.Rep . Oh Shin-hwan , a spokesman of the conservative Bareun Party , echoed the view , claiming the government should pay closer attention to the case and its impact on South Korea 's security.Parties also insisted the case should not have an adverse impact on the geopolitical situation surrounding the Korean Peninsula . `` The government should quickly and calmly cope with the situation so that it does not negatively impact inter-Korean relations , '' Rep. Youn Kwan-suk of the main opposition Democratic Party said.The minor People 's Party also said the incident should not lead to tension in Northeast Asia , urging the government to cooperate with Malaysia to find out details .

UNITED NATIONS - The Saudi Arabia-led coalition fighting in Yemen has been placed on a UN blacklist for killing and maiming children , drawing fresh calls from rights groups to step up pressure on Riyadh over the conflict .
The group was briefly included on the annual list of shame last year before a threat by Saudi Arabia to cut off its funding to UN programs forced a reversal .
In announcing the move , Secretary-General Antonio Guterres noted that the coalition had taken some measures to improve the protection of children .
`` In Yemen , the actions of the coalition to restore legitimacy in Yemen objectively led to that party being listed for the killing and maiming of children , '' said a report released along with the list as an annex .
In 2016 , the coalition was responsible for 683 child casualties and for 38 verified attacks on schools and hospitals , it said .
Yemen 's government forces , pro-government militias , the Huthi rebels and Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula ( AQAP ) were also cited for violations , but in a separate section of the list that said they had failed to protect children .
Guterres spoke to Saudi King Salman ahead of the release of the list , which UN officials had shared with Riyadh months earlier to avoid a repeat of the clash that followed the blacklisting by his predecessor Ban Ki-moon last year .
KSA rejects blacklisting
Saudi Arabia on Friday rejected the UN 's move to blacklist the coalition fighting in Yemen for the killing and maiming of children , calling the information cited in the international body 's annual list “ misleading . ”
“ We reject the inaccurate and misleading information and figures contained in the report , ” the Saudi Ambassador to the UN Abdallah al-Mouallimi told a news conference at the United Nations , insisting the Saudi-led coalition does everything possible to avoid hitting civilians .
Ban removed the coalition from the list and publicly complained that it was unacceptable for countries to `` exert undue pressure '' on the United Nations to avoid scrutiny . Saudi Arabia denied that it had pressured Ban and has since insisted that the coalition is respecting its obligations under international humanitarian law .
In a statement , Guterres stressed that the blacklist was `` not only to raise awareness '' but also to `` promote measures that can diminish the tragic plight of children in conflict . '' The UN chief said he was encouraged that some governments were taking steps to spare children from the horrors of conflict and voiced hope that `` more will follow . ''
The report and the list were on Thursday sent to the Security Council , which includes countries such as the United States , Britain and France that support the coalition in its war against Iran-backed Huthi rebels .
Human Rights Watch applauded the decision to include the coalition on the list but disputed the view that the military was taking measures to protect children .
`` The coalition needs to stop making empty promises to exercise caution , take concrete action to stop these deadly unlawful attacks in Yemen , and allow desperately needed fuel and aid to reach those in need , '' said Jo Becker , HRW 's children 's rights advocate .
`` Until this happens , governments should suspend all Saudi weapons sales , '' she said . The report said the coalition was responsible for 683 of the total 1,340 child casualties last year in Yemen and for 73 percent of the 52 attacks on schools and hospitals .
The council will hold a debate on the report on October 31 . Swedish Ambassador Olof Skoog , who leads the council 's committee on children and armed conflict , backed Guterres ' efforts to engage with Riyadh on the next steps and said the list should serve to `` promote change . ''
The Saudi-led Arab military coalition intervened in Yemen in 2015 to support the government of President Abedrabbo Mansour Hadi after the Huthis forced him into exile . The United Nations has listed Yemen as the world 's number one humanitarian crisis , with seven million Yemenis on the brink of famine and cholera causing more than 2,000 deaths .

A man walks by New York Stock Exchange in the financial district in New York , U.S. , August 10 , 2017 .
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Bearish stock investors are slowly coming out of hibernation , as money has begun to move into funds that aim to profit when markets dive .
U.S. mutual funds that attempt to profit in falling markets attracted $ 413 million in new investments during the second quarter , the funds ' largest inflows since the height of 2013 's `` Taper Tantrum '' selloff , according to Thomson Reuters ' Lipper research unit .
On Thursday , the S & P 500 experienced its first 1 percent-plus drop in 58 trading days , as the CBOE Volatility Index .VIX surged over 44 percent , noted Bespoke Investment Group .
The selling pressure in stocks follows a frustrating year-to-date for bearish stock investors , given that the S & P was up 10.5 percent since Dec. 31 as of Wednesday 's close . As of Thursday 's close , it is up 8.9 percent .
Markets this week were set in negative motion after the United States and North Korea exchanged threats . President Donald Trump said Thursday that his previous promise of `` fire and fury '' in response to any threats from North Korea may have not gone far enough , vowing `` trouble '' for the country if its actions do not change .
Brad Lamensdorf , portfolio manager for AdvisorShares Ranger Equity Bear ETF ( HDGE.P ) , said he has seen demand for his fund partly driven by `` people that feel like it 's time to hedge . ''
`` They 're pretty negative from a forward-looking view , '' he said . The fund targets stocks with low earnings quality or potential accounting problems ; it has attracted $ 20 million this year .
The demand for these funds comes after a long drought , and remains a mere drop in the bucket within the fund world . The funds posted outflows in nine of the last 15 quarters , according to Lipper .
By contrast , domestic stock mutual funds and exchange-traded funds have attracted $ 32 billion this year , including reinvested dividends , according to the Investment Company Institute , a trade group .
Demand for international stocks and bonds has been even stronger as investors tried to dial back exposure to U.S. stocks without the expensive costs attached to hedging strategies .
The bear funds keep a `` net short '' exposure to stocks , aiming to rise when markets fall . The cost of making that bet and the rising markets have helped the category deliver a negative 13.5 percent return this year , according to Lipper data through early August .
`` It 's sort of become almost a cliche that this has been the most hated bull market of all time , and I have a hard time buying into that , '' said Doug Ramsey , chief investment officer of the Leuthold Group LLC , whose firm offers a bear fund , the Grizzly Short Fund ( GRZZX.O ) .
The company 's tactical funds recently reduced their net equity exposure , but he said he could see another fresh top before entering a true bear market .
`` We 're only looking for a short-term setback here , '' he said .
Several major asset managers have expressed caution in recent days .
Bridgewater Associates LP 's Ray Dalio wrote on Thursday that `` prospective risks are now rising and do not appear appropriately priced in . ''
Russ Koesterich at BlackRock Inc ( BLK.N ) said in a note this week that tightening monetary policy in Europe and the United States could cause political uncertainty to morph `` from farce into tragedy '' by shaking investor confidence . Pacific Investment Management Company LLC portfolio managers Mihir Worah and Geraldine Sundstrom said U.S. equities are `` popular and crowded . ''
But some investors see the moderate U.S. equity flows and strengthening demand for bearish funds as a contrarian sign that the markets may have more room to run .
The nonprofit American Association of Individual Investors found that 36.1 percent of investors it surveyed expect the market to rise in the next six months , 2 percentage points below that gauge 's historical average . An above-average 32.1 percent of investors were bearish .
`` You do n't see the kind of euphoria that normally presents at the end of the cycle , '' said Leon Cooperman , chief executive of hedge fund Omega Advisors Inc. `` I do n't see sentiment characteristic of a top . ''
In the relatively short amount of time they 've been a band , Toronto four-piece Weaves have garnered a good amount of well-deserved acclaim . Last year , we named them a Band To Watch ahead of their self-titled debut , a collection of bright , frazzled art-rock that wound up earning Weaves a ton of buzz and a nomination for Canada 's Polaris Music Prize . You might expect that the band would be taking a little break after touring feverishly behind Weaves , but they 're already back with a great sophomore album , Wide Open . Compared to its predecessor , Wide Open finds Weaves continuing to experiment in all sorts of directions , toward songs that are less angular , songs that soar or glide and are n't afraid of being anthemic or vulnerable . It 's even better than their debut , and it is n't hard to imagine that some of the hooks on Wide Open are destined to fill slightly larger rooms than the band found themselves in last time .
We called Weaves frontwoman Jasmyn Burke and guitarist Morgan Waters at their homes in Toronto to talk about the process of finding a new weave on Wide Open . To celebrate the album coming out today , they 've also got director Zak Tatham 's new video for “ Slicked , ” where the band tries out a scuzzy classic rock groove . Check it out and read our interview below .
STEREOGUM : Weaves just played at the Polaris gala after being nominated for the prize . Was that a strange night ?
MORGAN WATERS : We played at the end so we had to keep our shit together and wait for our turn to play , so we could n't really relax . Feist was performing , and playing after her…it was humbling and it was fun to be able to play on that stage with other talented people .
STEREOGUM : Weaves has been active only a few years , and you 've done a lot already in that time . Is it weird to have gone through this process so rapidly , to put out the debut last year and get all this press buzz and a Polaris nomination ?
JASMYN BURKE : Ummm….Morgan ? [ laughs ]
WATERS : Is it weird , Jaz ? We are always confused about how old the band is . We have no concept of –
BURKE : It feels like it 's been a short amount of time . When you tour a lot you do n't really think about time . We do n't think about it much , we just keep working .
WATERS : It feels natural . It 's nice to get a little momentum and ride it . And we like each other . We 're willing to say , oh , we just toured for all this time now let 's go be creative together and spend more time together . The fact that we choose to do that is kinda crazy .
STEREOGUM : So it was n't overwhelming when you got home and jumped right into a second record .
BURKE : I think so…It 's not like our lives are completely different . We 're still working musicians , so you just have to keep pushing forward and keep being creative , otherwise you 'll be bored .
STEREOGUM : Wide Open has a lot of new sounds and structures for Weaves . Did you go into the writing thinking you wanted to explore these specific things ?
BURKE : I think we were just really excited to make new music . There was n't a pre-conceived idea of how the album would be , it just naturally happened . That 's the way we work . There 's not a lot of over-thinking to it . You tour so much and you become better performers and writers and , you know , we all were playing basically every night together , so once you do that you feel a new level of comfort in the band . Hopefully that shows in the new music .
WATERS : We listened to a lot of classic rock radio .
STEREOGUM : Did you come back from the road with some of these ideas percolating or was there a pent-up creative energy that you had n't been able to exercise on tour ?
BURKE : Yeah , more pent-up writing energy . Just ready to go . When we came back , I was nervous about writing , and I did n't think I 'd be able to actually figure out anything since I had n't written in a year . But then you realize your brain is always moving and taking in and absorbing , so it just kind of came out .
WATERS : My role was to be the cheerleader because Jaz would be like , “ I do n't know if I can still write ” and I 'd say “ What ! ? It 's good , it 's good , stop it , people do n't change. ” [ laughs ] You 're always starting from scratch and your abilities are in question when you 're starting it again but in the end you realize you were panicking for no reason .
STEREOGUM : What were some of the themes you gravitated to this time ?
BURKE : I felt more confident as a songwriter and…I feel like you evolve on the road and it changes you . I approach it in a more confident way and I did n't feel like I had to hide behind metaphors or these specific characters . I just wanted to be real . A lot of the stuff was very reactionary to our surroundings , or just hanging out getting stoned in the jam space . It 's kind of a mixture of things . I think Morgan was also ready to…I do n't know , we were ready to make things that were more direct .
WATERS : The idea was to be direct and try to achieve timeless , classic songwriting , try to do that thing . [ We were ] listening to R.E.M . in the van and other stuff like that where it can be so simple and it 's just about the lyrics and emotion and melody . So we were trying to do that world this time and keep it so that the songs…you could be 12 years old with an acoustic and still play them .
STEREOGUM : Do you think of Weaves as the sort of project where you want to take on a different sonic identity with each album or did this just sorta happen ?
BURKE : I feel like our music will always sound like Weaves in its own way , and I think especially live , the songs just become Weaves songs . But I think it 's more interesting to push yourself to try to write different music for different albums . My favorite artists are n't pigeonholing themselves to one specific type of song . Our first album was so varied in a way , as well , and it was so different from our EP . I think we would just get bored . You want to push yourself to make better music , and by way of doing that you make things that are different . But it 's all the same players . If you heard the album , you would know it 's us .
WATERS : Hopefully our personalities overcome the genre-jumping . My favorite bands , like Ween , they sounded all over the place—
BURKE : Madonna , look at her !
WATERS : Oh , yeah . We want to jump around and show different sounds . We love music so much why not switch genres when the emotion of the song makes sense ?
STEREOGUM : Yeah I can hear that , the way “ Slicked ” is like a total classic rock radio jam but still with that Weaves twist , or the way people compared “ # 53 ” to Springsteen or U2 but it does n't sound quite the same .
BURKE : Obviously you 're going to draw from the past , you ca n't help that . But creating in a way where it 's fresh and it sounds unique to your story…in particular , I 'm a woman making rock music and I 'm traveling on the road . Maybe there have n't been that many really popular artists that are females in this specific genre . I feel like that 's kinda exciting , having a different voice than those guys who wrote those timeless songs . But at the same time , yeah , everybody 's influenced by everybody so it 's about making it your own .
STEREOGUM : I also wanted to ask you about some of the individual songs — in particular , “ # 53 ” is one of my favorite songs of the year .
BURKE : That one…I did n't even think it would be a Weaves song . Initially , I just did a loop with vocals . I was doing solo shows and Morgan came to one and was like “ What 's that one ? ” So we just picked it apart .
WATERS : That was a fun one . Originally it was later in the album , and Jaz was like , that feels weird , it should start it . It became the “ opening the doors ” to the record , the grand entry to the record . Since it was taking on this anthemic “ Born To Run ” feel — we try to be simple , but on that one we took it over the top and did a bunch of overdubs and glockenspiel , so all that kinda stuff makes it that grand entry point to the record .
STEREOGUM : It 's a hell of a way to introduce a sophomore album a year later , not only as an opening track but as a lead single . It 's storming out of the gates with something that sounds new and different for you guys .
BURKE : I think we felt confident with it and it was exciting to do something outside of what we had put out previously . It has that kind of energy –
WATERS : End of the world . It 's fun flirting with being over the top and bombastic . Maybe things some bands would shy away from . We 're not snobby . We 'll be slightly cheesy and own it .
STEREOGUM : I think it 's cool when bands are still comfortable with being straightforward with that and just saying “ Yeah , we 're going to write a huge song. ” I think you 're right and some bands still feel like that 's gauche in some way . The old indie mindset .
WATERS : We like being gauche .
STEREOGUM : “ Grass ” was another one that stood out to me .
BURKE : Was that later in the process as well Morgan ?
WATERS : Oh , no , that was early remembered ? I sent you a demo and you were kinda like “ Meh ” and it sat there for a bit , but there was something about it that we were into when we returned to it .
BURKE : It almost did n't make it onto the album . We were fighting over what it should be , the tone it should take . And then it hit—it 's a groovy , chill song .
WATERS : That , to me , is the most adult-contemporary…it 's the most dangerous because of that . It freaked me out to work on it , because it was like , “ Wow , this is straight-up acoustic. ” I kinda love it the most for that . I went away to Portugal and listened to the basic tracks and thought up the guitar parts that finished it . It was one that I always thought was a straight-up , good song that was stuck in my head all the time . And it was called “ Grass , ” so , you know . [ laughs ]
STEREOGUM : I know it 's been a bit tongue-in-cheek , but you 've called Wide Open your Americana record .
WATERS : I guess we started with “ Walkaway. ” That was the first demo we had and it was like , oh , let 's go down this road . It 's timeless and classic and simple . So we were chasing that for a while , so we had a couple more songs that fell in that world . That was the start , and then as the record developed we threw in some curveballs like “ Scream ” and “ Motherfucker ” and other ones that do n't really fit that . In a way , the emotional feeling of just a straight-up record with a bunch of good songs was the end goal we had .
STEREOGUM : So by that term , are you thinking of the classic rock radio thing or how much you traveled on tour ?
WATERS : Definitely both .
BURKE : Yeah , both . We spent so much time on the road actually listening to the radio that it seeps into your head . “ Walkaway ” was the first song written off the album and that felt like it was setting a tone .
WATERS : To me , the album has the flow…It 's like a bar band for the first three or four songs and then it 's a loose concept over a night . A band playing in a bar , then Jasmyn goes outside and has an aside , and then a bomb hits basically . “ Wide Open ” is like the “ Somewhere Over The Rainbow ” before the tornado of “ Motherfucker ” and “ Scream. ” Then the back half is picking up the pieces . The album art kinda ties into that .
STEREOGUM : It seems like lightning kinda struck for Wide Open — do you feel like you 're still in that place ? Would you want to keep churning out a record a year ?
WATERS : As long as we like each other .
BURKE : [ laughs ] Yeah , I mean , you ca n't really predict if you 're going to feel inspired or have writer 's block . We 've always made music . All of us had made music since we were kids . So even though there 's people watching now it 's like , I do n't know , if you write every week since you 're ten years old , I do n't think it 's going to stop happening . We have another album 's worth of music that we have at the side now so maybe we 'll release some fun stuff this year .
WATERS : There 's not too much staring at a blank page in this band . It 's pretty fast and furious .
Wide Open is out now via Kanine , Buzz Records , and Memphis Industries . Purchase it here .

A 35-year-old man doing doughnuts in a stolen tractor at a Wyoming County baseball field struck a state trooper who tried to arrest him earlier this week , state police at Tunkhannock said .
George Zacharias Jr. , 35 , 864-Star Hill Road , Monroe Twp. , is charged with aggravated assault , resisting arrest and other counts from the Tuesday morning incident , state police said in a news release Friday .
According to a criminal complaint filed by Trooper Albert Levanavage , the tractor 's owner reported that he saw his missing machine doing doughnuts in a baseball field near Plattsburg Road in Monroe Twp .
State police found the tractor in an open field next to Hoyt Road and , lights and sirens on , tried to stop it . Instead , the tractor drove over a stone wall and into an adjacent field .
Troopers saw two people come out of the woods near a house on Star Hill Road , where they last saw the tractor , and ordered them to stop . A woman did . A man , later identified as Zacharias , ran back into the woods .
State police followed the footprints he left in the snow for 1 mile before apprehending him . Zacharias fought against his arrest and swung his elbow into the left side of Trooper Cody Scepaniak 's face .
A syringe and spoon , common items used to prepare and inject narcotics , were found in Zacharias ' pants pocket .
Zacharias is in Wyoming County Correctional Facility in lieu of $ 25,000 bail . A preliminary hearing is scheduled for Thursday .

It 's an epic adventure that has taken a New York man to 34 states , spanning over 40,000 miles in the last seven years , guided to the Hawaiian islands this week by the seams of a battered baseball that could one day end up in the Hall of Fame .
Ralph Carhart started the “ Hall Ball Project ” in 2010 , taking a baseball that he found in Cooperstown on a photographic journey to over 300 members of baseball 's hall of fame , both live and deceased , as the ball has been photographed either with the hall of famer or at the resting place of the baseball legend .
Monday morning , he took the ball to the showering grave-site at the Oahu Cemetery of the final deceased member on his mission , Alexander Joy Cartwright , considered the “ father of baseball ” as the creator of the game 's modern rules .
April 17th , 2017 marks as Cartwright 's 197th birthday , and Carhard was in attendance at the annual celebration of like for the one-time Hawaiian royalty advisor and Hawaii 's first fire chief . Serving as the perfect apex for the project in paradise .
“ It 's something that I could have never possibly imagined . When I began the project seven years ago , I knew Hawaii was on the list but I honestly was n't even sure if I would finish the project . The fact that it 's ending here in this magical place is something I could never have imagined . You know it 's the alpha and omega that the end of my journey is at the place where the man who more than anyone else in the hall of fame was there at the very beginning is certainly a symbolism that was not accidental ” said , Carhart .
When asked what the fellow baseball fans that he has met on his journey have meant to him and his adventure , the smiling Carhart noted that it has brought a similar joy that the game he loves so much provides . “ It 's great . To find out that this crazy idea I had connects with other people . That they wish that they could have gone on this journey with me , that this group of people that are here today to honor Alexander and to want to hear my story is a little overwhelming sometimes you know , that 's part of what I never could have expected seven years ago is that when I took that final photograph , that there would be a group of people here that would want me to talk to them about it when I was done , it 's pretty incredible ” said , Carhart .
Later this summer Carhart will meet with the Baseball Hall of Fame to discuss a possible home for the ball and its remarkable story . At that time he could also possibly hand the project over to the hall of fame , as the members will continue to grow each year .

Sometimes tragedy inspires change , and sometimes music can do the same .
Hawaii artist Landon McNamara was so moved by the Las Vegas massacre and all the recent violence that 's been happening around the world — that he wrote a song about it all and that song is quickly going viral…it 's called “ Loss for Words . ”
The song was written Monday on a drive into town to the studio from the North Shore as Landon and Etienne Aureilius were discussing what 's happening in the world . they released a little clip later in the day and it immediately got retweeted and posted – over 25,000 views in 24 hours on Instagram by local professional surfers , celebrities and many island fans .
The song and video is being released on Friday on iTunes , and here 's what 's amazing — proceeds from the song are going to Las Vegas victims ' families .
Landon was recently featured on KHON2 's “ Ha'ina ” special .
He was nominated for a Na Hoku Hanohano award this year and his album was number one on iTunes which went from # 30 yesterday to # 1 after the video went viral and well as # 1 on Billboard reggae charts .
Landon gained nearly 20,000 followers since the song was posted .
It truly shows the power of social media and the power of music .
Iowa legislators have begun what may be a long debate over changes to Iowa 's collective bargaining law for more than 180,000 teachers and government workers . Senator Jason Schultz , a Republican from Schleswig , opened Senate debate on the bill at about four o'clock this afternoon .
“ I 'd like to thank my colleagues in the senate for what has been and will likely be a spirited discussion about Senate File 213 , ” Schultz said . “ …I understand the people of our state are passionate about these issues . That is why there has been so much energy in this building . ”
About two hours later , Democratic Senator Tony Bisignano of Des Moines drew cheers from the crowd watching debate when he called the bill “ ugly . ”
“ The only good thing to come out of this election is that we 're getting rid of this governor who 's been a mean-spirited governor to public employees , ” Bisgnano said , in reference to Republican Governor Terry Branstad and people seated in the senate gallery erupted with cheers , whistles and applause . “ And hopefully the new governor will look at the people of Iowa as their friends and their neighbors and their family because you can not say you love Iowa and you hate Iowans . ”
Senator Nate Boulton , a Democrat from Des Moines , said workers have “ valid concerns ” about the legislation .
“ This bill and its impact on our communities will be historic , ” Boulton said . “ The debate we are having right now is about the very soul of our state . ”
Boulton and other critics say the bill will set in motion a yearly “ certification ” process that will be the “ death knell ” for public sector unions . Supporters of the bill say union wages and benefits have gotten too expensive . Schultz said the bill puts new “ accountability ” in the contract negotiating process .
“ I want the teachers , the snowplow drivers and other public employees to know I appreciate your contributions to our state , ” Schultz said . “ Your hard work is valued . You are not the target of this . We are seeking to make a better Iowa , including you . ”
Senator Bill Dotzler , a Democrat from Waterloo , noted the debate on the bill began on February 14 .
“ I find it a cruel irony that today on St. Valentine 's Day you choose to break the hearts of workers by really massacring their rights in the workplace , ” Dotzler said .
Schultz said the bill does not get rid of public workers ' pensions and it requires governments that have been offering health care benefits to continue to provide coverage .
“ There are a number of people using scare tactics to rally opposition to this bill , ” Schultz said . “ …This bill will not mean mass firings for public employees . ”
Critics say while health insurance benefits would continue , public workers may have to make significant premium co-payments . Senator Matt McCoy , a Democrat from Des Moines , called the bill “ horrendous . ”
“ Stop and think about what you 're doing , McCoy said . “ I beseech you to oppose this rubbish and return it to Wisconsin from where it came . ”
Iowa 's collective bargaining law gives public workers the right to bargain for benefits , wages and other workplace issues . In exchange , employees give up the right to strike . The Senate debated the bill until about 8:30 p.m. and is expected to resume discussions tomorrow .
The Iowa House began debating the bill shortly after 8 p.m. Representative Steven Holt , a Republican from Denison , opened by saying taxpayers are at a “ disadvantage ” today .
“ They are at a disadvantage because the current system requires an arbitrator to consider the state or local government 's ability to raise taxes as a factor in the determination of the approval of pay and benefit packages , ” Holt said , “ thus creating the potential that the heavy hand of government will plunge ever more deeply into taxpayer wallets . ”
Representative Bruce Hunter , a Democrat from Des Moines , accused Holt of describing an “ alternate reality . ”
“ I apologize that I 'm not in a too good of a mood right now because attacking the rights of 180,000 workers of the state of Iowa kind of gets me a little mad , ” Hunter said . “ And that 's what this bill does . ”
Representative Abby Finkenaur , a Democrat from Dubuque , criticized a Republican lawmaker who was wearing headphones at his desk during the debate .
“ Wake up and pay attention…This is important , ” Finkenaur said . “ Get off your computers . Get off your phones and pay attention because I know our Iowa workers and their families are paying attention to this debate tonight . ”
House Republicans announced earlier this afternoon that they intend to scale-back their proposal , but the debate has not reached a point for a vote on that alternative . The changes would let subjects like seniority rights and how to handle workplace grievances be discussed during contract talks– but only if both the union and managers agree those issues should be negotiated . In addition , Holt said the GOP 's new draft plan aims to reassure public workers that layoffs and firings should be done for “ proper cause . ”

LAHORE - A terror hit always follows a spell of condemnation , mourning , and strong resolve to deal with the perpetrators of terror with iron hands and award them exemplary punishment yet evil doers again get a chance to wreak havoc on the life of people shattering all claims of the government . The recurrence of terror hits sounds the government relapses into business as usual soon after a tragedy happens .
Every terror hit gives some clues to the lapses in the security step , and demands the government to fix those as a matter of discharging its paramount duty of protecting life of the people , for which both the common man and the security personnel are entitled to under the constitution .
A terror attack brings human tragedy , it creates panic among the people and tests their resilience , at the same time however it presents an opportunity to fix the things . The aftermath is a time to reflect , to chart a way forward , to get up and take practical measures to avert recurrence of the destructive acts .
In the Charing Cross suicide hit , it is highly painful that senior police officials among the citizens have been martyred . The reach of the terrorists to that highly sensitive part of the town which is regarded as Red Zone , is highly alarming .
The Mall is banned for the public gathering under the Lahore High Court order while the Hall Road traders also abhor the Mall being used for protest as it badly harms their business .
Since inception of this government , hundreds of protests have been staged at the Charing Cross , also know as Faisal Chowk , by the people relating to almost every class of profession and call . By the grace of Allah , no terror incident took place previously , though a terror alert had been issued months ago about terrorists hitting the Punjab Assembly .
This time round a special warning was issued some 10 days ago but flaw was left in security which the terrorists exploited to their advantage .
After the cricket board had announced to hold final of the Pakistan Super League in Lahore , the people say , the government needed to be more on its guard and alert to preclude any destructive happening – particularly when a conspiracy is being hatched by our arch rival India to isolated Pakistan in the cricket world which this country once ruled with much pride .
After experiencing so much damage and destruction for so many years after 9/11 , we have been speaking loud to have done much to deal with situation .
During the peak of terrorism in the country , Lahore was targeted at various places including FIA building , Naval War College , Elite Police Training School Manawan , Wahga Border , Gulshan Iqbal Park , Moon Market , GPO Chowk , Data Darbar , Anarkali Food Street , a church at Youhanabad and a religious place at Ghari Shahu . But hitting people outside the Punjab Assembly , at the heart of the provincial capital , shows much on the security side than what meet the eyes .
Almost every incident has been backed by beforehand intimation by the intelligent sources about the entry of terrorists and the impending action . But the terror attack has been taking place putting a big question on security steps .
After every incident , the government puts its foot down to incapacitate the terrorists through foolproof security steps . And the people take its words on the face value , thinking the government has found out the way how to deal with the situation and is moved to action with full force to ensure their security .
However , every next happening smacks the impression at the public level that masses ' security is not on the priority list of the government . These sentiments were again heard by the people after Charing Cross attack last day .
The civilian government has been claiming credit for making reducing the frequency of terror attacks , but the people at large believe that it 's the fruit of the operations carried out by the military on its own initiative and out of its own conviction .
Had there been a sincere political will making the civilian set up fully synchronize and coordinate their efforts with the armed forces to eliminate anti-peace elements from the settled areas of the country , the menace of terrorism would have completely vanished by now , they believe . The logic behind this public perception is quite simple : no terrorist groomed and launched hundreds of miles away in Pak-Afghan border areas can carry out an attack of this kind without support from local elements .
If the Punjab police , civilian security agencies and the civilian administration can show excellent performance towards protecting the most sensitive Moharram and Eid gatherings over the last three years , they can do the same on ordinary days provided the local collaborators of the terrorists are weeded out .
It would be wrong to say government has done nothing about addressing the terror problem . It has made some progress in implementing the National Action Plan ( NAP ) , setting up multiple tiers of security and evolving a high tech and coordinated intelligence network and surveillance system . CCTV cameras are being operated under billions of rupees Safe City Project spread over the whole city , and a quite strict security check has been imposed on the entry and exit points of the city . But the problem is that it 's not enough .
The provincial ministers particularly the Law Minister Rana Sana Ullah Khan have been making big claims of neutralising the terror network and tracing their route and line of action . They also claimed about reaching out to the facilitators of the evil doers and curbing the extremist sentiments which attract the innocent mind to terror related activity . A recurrence of terror incident however , puts a big question mark on these claims and makes the public feel betrayed by their own elected representatives .
Among researchers who study the potential effects of rising sea levels , and among the city planners in coastal areas who are actively trying to come up with viable plans for their communities , the idea of retreat is catching on . The alternative is to build physical defenses—costly sea walls , levees , or flood gates that might not do the job . In extreme cases , retreat might mean relocating existing critical infrastructure ; more often , though , it simply means avoiding building new things in vulnerable areas so that buildings , roads , or entire communities do n't end up in a future floodplain . That might seem like common sense , but those waterfront areas are often the most desirable real estate in the city .

In the UK , the National Trust , which is responsible for hundreds of miles of coastal property , has been advocating a policy of retreat or “ rolling back. ” The country needs to abandon its “ Churchillian ” attitude of “ holding the line , ” the organization says , and consider letting some areas go . These policies are outlined in the Trust 's report “ Shifting Shores , ” available here .
It turns out , though , that people have strong emotional responses to the word “ retreat. ” As detailed in this article , some scientists—even those whose own term for their field of study is “ climate migration ” —choose to avoid the word altogether when talking to the public . It implies that we 're losing the battle , and even if the scientists themselves believe that is exactly what 's happening , they do n't want to alienate their audience . If the situation seems hopeless , their thinking goes , people will avoid doing anything about it at all .
Others , such as Klaus Jacob of Columbia University 's Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory , use the word often and deliberately in an attempt to make people understand the scope of the problems we 're facing . He says New York City 's time is limited , at least in its present form , and that it will become “ a gradual Atlantis. ” Yet waterfront development in New York is booming . As one real estate agent says , “ Everybody 's going to build wherever they can , every inch . Unless we are permanently underwater , I do n't think there will be much change . ”
There 's a similar trend in San Francisco : Officials believe that by the end of the century permanent flooding will be 3 feet above the current high tide level , and as high as 8 feet above current high tide level during severe storms . But even while the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission has been developing those models , the city has approved development on 50 waterfront parcels , representing billions of dollars of investment . According to the article , “ The city seems to be doubling down on San Francisco 's southeastern waterfront as the place for a massive amount of new development . The Southern Bayfront Strategy encourages developers to build 20,000 new homes and up to 5 million square feet of offices on open space…on the city 's eastern waterfront . ”
Karen O'Neill of Rutgers University—one of those scientists who avoid using the word retreat—says a better solution is for cities to develop attractive inland spaces that make people want to move away from the water . That seems eminently reasonable and also highly unlikely , given most people 's focus on the near term and the popularity of the shore . What do you think—does the terminology matter ? Should we be limiting near-shore development or letting it continue ? If we let it continue , should the National Flood Insurance Program cover it ? Leave a comment below .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The United States on Friday banned the export of weapons and defence services to South Sudan , stepping up pressure against President Salva Kiir to end the country 's four-year civil war .
While the United States does not conduct arms sales with South Sudan , the move prevents any U.S. company or citizen from providing military equipment or defence services to the country 's warring factions .
The unilateral arms embargo was another signal that Washington is losing patience with South Sudan 's leaders after repeated agreements to end the violence . The war has been marked by brutal attacks against civilians , which has sparked the region 's biggest refugee crisis since the 1994 Rwandan genocide .
In South Sudan 's capital Juba , Kiir 's spokesperson Ateny Wek Ateny declined to comment .
The Trump administration has pressed neighbouring countries and African groups , such as the eight-member Intergovernmental Authority on Development ( IGAD ) , to sanction South Sudanese officials who undermine the peace process .
The State Department said in a statement it would amend the International Traffic in Arms Regulations ( ITAR ) to reflect the arms ban on South Sudan . Other countries on the blacklist include Belarus , China , Cuba , Iran , North Korea , Syria and Venezuela .
OFFICIALS SANCTIONED
Some top officials close to Kiir have already been sanctioned by the United States , including the once-powerful army chief Paul Malong , who was later fired and forced into exile when he quarrelled with the president .
The African Union on Monday said it was open to impose sanctions on leaders violating ceasefires in South Sudan , joining a chorus of officials who say those prolonging the conflict must be punished .
U.S. ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley told the U.N. Security Council last week it was time to impose a U.N. arms embargo on South Sudan . Haley visited South Sudan in late October and met with Kiir .
The Obama administration had failed to convince the United Nations to back an arms embargo in 2016 .

Any U.S. push for the U.N. Security Council to take further action against South Sudan is likely to be resisted by veto power Russia . The council , however , sanctioned several senior South Sudanese officials on both sides of the conflict in 2015 .
“ The time has come to acknowledge the hard reality that the leaders of South Sudan are not just failing their people , they are betraying them . And so this Council is at a crossroads , ” Haley told the council last Wednesday . “ We can not stand by idly as innocent civilians are murdered and raped . ”
Brian Adeba of the Enough Project , a Washington-based policy group fighting to prevent genocide and atrocities , said a weapons ban would be more effective if it was imposed by a group of countries , including some in Africa .
“ A unilateral action risks being symbolic , ” he said , adding , “ However , we believe that the United States should not just restrict this to an arms embargo , but should escalate this by enacting more targeted financial pressures . ”
WAR
Oil-rich South Sudan has been wrecked by civil war since 2013 , when troops loyal to Kiir clashed with troops loyal to then-Vice President Riek Machar .
The conflict has claimed tens of thousands of lives since then , slashed oil production and driven about a third of the population of 12 million from their homes .
The European Union imposed an arms embargo on Sudan in 1994 , which was amended to also apply to South Sudan when the country gained independence from Sudan in 2011 .
Independent U.N. experts have reported to the U.N. Security Council that South Sudan 's government has spent millions of dollars on weapons as the country slid into famine and an economic crisis .
In January 2016 , U.N. experts reported that sources had told them : “ Uganda either supplies South Sudan with its own stock or acquires the weapons and then transfers them to South Sudan , without necessarily involving or obtaining the consent of the primary seller . ”
Last year , the U.N. experts said : “ Weapons continue to flow into South Sudan from diverse sources , often with the coordination of neighbouring countries . ”

From Italy 's standpoint , it was true , Italy had been fairly royally chiseled out of any substantive World War spoils . The Allies had promised the sun and moon and then left Italy with crumbs , Eritrea and Italian Somaliland , nothing but barren desert . Some Roman Empire that was . Well , Italy had Albania , too , but of course Albania was worthless . So it was that Benito Mussolini cast Italian eyes again on the ancient cradle of the Kingdom of Abyssinia . Abyssinia was nothing but barren desert either , so far as that went , but at least there was more of it .
Italy was still relatively new to the world stage in the 1930s . Until 1870 Italy had been a medieval collection of poor duchies and poorer principalities , and its early attempts to expand across the Mediterranean into Tunis were contemptuously blocked by the older powers . The Italian armies were not particularly sophisticated , in any case : When in 1896 the dictator Francesco Crispi resolved to make a protectorate of Abyssinia , 8,000 Italian soldiers were slaughtered at Adowa by Abyssinians armed with sticks and spears . Great was this sting . Italy had been just mortified ever since .
Now , in 1935 , Mussolini was determined both to avenge the old [ Adwa ] humiliation and to stake an emperor 's claim at last to Italy 's rightful colonial place in the sun . Now the Roman legions were mechanized , bristling with tanks and warplanes , and all the world knew that Italy would storm defenseless Ethiopia the day the September rains stopped . The great powers did not approve , but the slightest diplomatic misstep could easily mean another world war ; now Haile Selassie , Ras Tafari , the Lion of Judah , came before the League of Nations to plead for deliverance , and the great powers all went deaf .
On Tuesday , the 1st of October , as Europe watched silently , Caproni bombers blasted [ Adwa ] into rubble and columns of troops poured across the border and destroyed the pathetic war-dancing spearmen who rose up to meet them . The sun had not set before the Italo-Ethiopian War came as well to the hundreds of thousands of Italians and the hundreds of thousands of blacks who sought to live together in the City of New York…
At this very moment , Col. Hubert Julian , the Black Eagle of Harlem , was in Addis Ababa , and it would have been his most glorious hour if he 'd only had an airplane . Trinidad-born Hubert Fauntleroy Julian had been one of Harlem 's most flamboyant figures for years . One of the pioneer black fliers .. and he frequently mesmerized citizens by parachuting , crimson-clad , onto 125th St .

LAHORE - Police mistakenly shot dead a teenage boy while chasing suspected car riders in Badami Bagh on Tuesday morning , eyewitness said .
Police claimed they arrested five robbery suspects following the deadly shooting which took place outside the main mosque near Mughal Bus Stop on Bund Road at 10:30am .
Fourteen-year-old Saleem was filling a water bottle from a roadside cooler when a bullet pierced through his body . The teen factory worker was rushed to a hospital but died on the way . His body was later moved to the morgue for autopsy .
Eyewitnesses said four policemen of Dolphins Unit riding on two motorcycles were chasing a suspected car . The police opened fire on the car-riders when they did not stop the vehicle at a checkpoint .
“ The policemen were firing on the car-riders but the bullet struck an innocent boy nearby , ” said Ghulam Ali , a labourer who witnessed the fatal shooting .
A fruit and vegetable vendor said the driver later stopped the vehicle after it slightly hit a tractor-trolley . “ The policemen searched the vehicle but could not recover anything from the car . No weapons , no drugs , ( and ) nothing else , ” said Zulfikar who was selling vegetables in the area when the shooting unfolded .
Eyewitnesses also rejected the police claims of crossfire . “ We saw policemen were firing on the fleeing car-riders . The men inside the car were unarmed . The police did not seize any weapon from their possession , ” said Raja Imran , who works at a nearby shop .
The CCTV footage , collected by police from cameras installed on the nearby shops , shows Dolphins motorcycle-units chasing a car . One of the policemen , sitting on the backseat of the two-wheeler , could be seen firing on the moving car with a handgun from the rear side .
Another video-clip shows the deceased boy falling on the ground immediately after receiving a bullet . A few men , who were also filling water bottles from the cooler , look at the child in a shock as he falls on the ground .
Police officer Shamas Durrani claimed the police were chasing criminals when they were fleeing in the car . “ We have arrested all the five men who were inside the car . They were wanted to police in several armed robbery cases . They were coming to Lahore from Sheikhupura to commit armed robberies , ” the deputy superintendent of the police said .
Durrani also said the police were investigating the shooting incident thoroughly and everything will be cleared after the probe . The officer claimed that one of the car-riders was also injured in the incident . He was also arrested and sent to a hospital . His accomplices were shifted to an unknown police facility for further interrogation .
According to eyewitness , the policemen badly tortured the car-riders on the road before shifting them to the lock-up . A bystander said the police fired straight fire on one of the car-riders during the search .
Dozens of locals including relatives of the victim gathered on the spot and staged a protest demonstration against the police for mistakenly killing the boy . The protesters blocked the road and continued their protest for an hour .
More police reinforcements were sent to the site to control the situation . The police managed to clear the road for traffic after holding a series of negotiations with the protesters . The officers assured the victim family that the criminals involved in the shooting would be brought to justice .
Later , the police registered a murder case on the complaint of Ameer Ali , father of the victim . The father told the police that his 14-year-old son was working as a watchman at a local factory .
Ironically , the police registered the case against unidentified gunmen and tried to exonerate the policemen . According to the FIR , the boy died during the “ crossfire ” between the Dolphins Police and the car-riders .
A police source familiar with the development said the FIR was registered on the complaint of the victim 's father but “ according to the desire of the policemen . ”
When contacted , Dolphins Police SP Nadeem Khokhar was unavailable for comments .
However , an investigator at the Badami Bagh police station said the autopsy report would help police establish the facts . He said they were investigating the killing and the culprits would be brought to justice soon .
In his press release , SSP Operations Muntazir Mehdi said an investigation into the shooting was underway . He claimed that the five men arrested after the shooting were involved in more than 100 cases of heinous crimes .
Police have recovered arms and ammunition from the arrested , he added .
Meanwhile , Punjab Chief Minister ian Shehbaz Sharif took notice of the deadly police shooting and ordered the capital city police officer to send back a detailed report of the incident within 24 hours . Further investigation was underway .
Lucknow : In quite a controversial statement , All India Muslim Personal Law Board Vice-President Maulana Kalbe Sadik has said that even if SC order about Babri Masjid in Ayodhya comes in favour of his community , in that scenario too land should be handed over to Hindus .
Sadik believes that the whole case is not the matter of Hindu-Muslim but India in general .
Shia Waqf Board has already announced in media that temple should be constructed at the disputed site . And with regard to mosque , it should be constructed at any land of high Muslim population .
The mosque was demolished by Hindu Karsevaks on December 6 , 1992 in Ayodhya .
According to Hindus , it is the birthplace of Lord Rama where a mosque was constructed in 1528-29 CE by Mir Baqi .
Since the mosque was constructed by Mughal emperor Babur , it was named Babri Masjid .

MUMBAI - At least five people were injured on Tuesday when part of a pedestrian bridge at a Mumbai train station collapsed during morning rush hour amid heavy rains , officials said , as authorities struggled to restore the busy station .
Hours after the incident , a platform at another rail station in Mumbai , India 's financial capital , caught fire due to a short circuit , police said . No casualties were immediately reported .
In the first mishap , a concrete slab fell onto empty train tracks at the Andheri station , damaging part of the platform roof and high-tension electric wires . Rescuers cut through the concrete and iron of the fallen slab , while engineers worked to restore power and train services .
Continuing rains hampered rescue and relief operations . The overpass connects the eastern and western portions of the railways station , and the collapse stranded passengers during the morning rush .
Railroad spokesman Ravinder Bhakar said no trains were passing in the area at the time of the collapse . He said the incessant rains seemed to have caused cracks in the bridge , resulting in the collapse . Aaj Tak television news channel said the bridge was more than 50 years old .
Police official Yaibhav Nigade said at least five people who were walking on the bridge were injured and hospitalized . He said all the people trapped in the debris had been rescued , but that rescue teams using sniffer dogs were still searching the debris .
Nigade did not say how many people had been trapped .
India Today TV quoted an eyewitness saying he heard someone calling out to be saved . Another witness said some people were trapped under the concrete debris .
India 's railway minister , Piyush Goyal , ordered an investigation . In a tweet , Goyal `` directed officials to speed up repair work and rapidly restore traffic in close coordination with other departments . ''
Many streets and roads were waterlogged in Mumbai as monsoon rains continued lashing the city . Weather officials forecast heavy rains in the coming days .
In the second incident , a short circuit caused a fire at a platform of another rail station , where maintenance work was ongoing . Indian broadcasters showed images of some people running for cover as the fire engulfed the platform .
Every day , millions of commuters use the sprawling train network in Mumbai and its suburbs .
Last year , at least 22 people died and 32 others suffered injuries in a stampede triggered by a rumor that a pedestrian overpass had collapsed after concrete chunks fell at another railway station .
Obamacare Is First Item On Congress ' Chopping Block

Congress is back in session on Tuesday , and leaders of both houses say their first order of business will be to repeal Obamacare .
If they do that , it will be a slap in the face to President Barack Obama just three weeks before he leaves the White House . The Affordable Care is the outgoing president 's signature achievement , marked by an elaborate signing ceremony in March 2010 at the White House , with lofty speeches from the vice president and Obama himself .
`` Today , after almost a century of trying , today after over a year of debate , today , after all the votes have been tallied , health insurance reform becomes law in the United States of America , '' Obama said that day , to long applause from the assembled crowd .
And Joe Biden famously leaned over to remind the president that it was `` a big * * * ing deal . ''
But Republicans have been vowing to repeal the law since the day it passed , and they 'll soon have a sympathetic president in the White House to sign whatever bill they send him .
`` We will repeal the disaster known as Obamacare and create new health care , all sorts of reforms that work for you and your family , '' President-elect Donald Trump vowed last month in Orlando .
That new health care plan has n't been fleshed out yet by Trump or his allies in Congress . So they say they 'll vote to get rid of Obamacare , but delay its demise until they come up with a replacement that will cover the millions of people who have insurance thanks to the law .
But insurance companies and health care analysts are worried .
`` I do n't see how you talk to any [ insurance ] carrier and give them any desire to hang around to see what they replace it with , '' says Dr. Kavita Patel , an internist at Johns Hopkins University Hospital and senior fellow at the Brookings Institution . `` Why would you stick around for that ? ''
Patel worked in the White House and helped create the Affordable Care Act . But she 's not alone in her concern .
Last month the health insurance trade group America 's Health Insurance Plans sent a letter to lawmakers asking them to keep in place many of the financial incentives that are central to the law — including subsidies for patients to help them buy insurance and cover copayments , and a provision that eliminates some taxes on insurers .
The American Academy of Actuaries also warned in its own letter that a repeal of the ACA without replacing it would be dangerous to the long-term health of the insurance market .
Still , Republicans appear determined to move ahead with the vote as soon as this week .
Some history :
Democrats rammed the Affordable Care Act through Congress in 2010 with no Republican support .
It was a huge , complicated law and , like most legislation , it was flawed . Over the subsequent six years , Republicans , who were angry at the way the Affordable Care Act was passed , refused to cooperate in any actions that would be seen as helping it succeed . Instead , they promised in speeches and television interviews to repeal it entirely . In fact , the House has voted more than 60 times over the years to do just that .
Enlarge this image toggle caption Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images
`` There 's no getting around the fact that lots of Republicans campaigned hard against the ACA and a lot of them won , including the person at the top of the ticket , '' says James Capretta , a scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute .
But even with control of both chambers of Congress and with Trump in the White House , Republicans ca n't simply repeal Obamacare . They would need the help of at least a handful of Democrats to overcome a filibuster .
Democrats ca n't , however , filibuster budget bills . So Republican leaders have decided to defund Obamacare , eliminating the tax penalties for those who do n't buy insurance and the subsidies to help people pay their premiums . Essentially , that guts the law 's main elements .
The problem for Republicans is that today , an estimated 20 million people get their insurance through Obamacare . About 10 million buy policies through the exchanges set up by state and federal governments , and most of those patients get subsidies to help pay the premiums .
And millions more are covered because the law allows states to expand the number of people who are eligible for Medicaid , the health insurance program for the poor .
So people who had pre-existing conditions that shut them out of the insurance market before the ACA passed , or people who had reached insurer-imposed lifetime benefit limits , generally like the law .
But , then there are people like Will Denecke , who is mad because his insurance costs have gone up since Obamacare passed . Before the law was enacted , he spent about $ 340 a month on health insurance .
`` Incredibly , we got a notice from my health care company , Moda , which has been having financial problems , that my premium was going up to $ 930 , '' he said last October .
He 's a self-employed urban planning consultant in Portland , Ore. , and , unlike most people in Obamacare , he makes too much money to qualify for government subsidies .
`` I 've had health insurance my whole life , but it 's just offensive in principle to think of spending $ 1,000 a month on health care insurance when there is a good chance I wo n't need it , '' he said .
He was considering just letting his coverage lapse .
And , on the other side , you 've got people like Leigh Kvetko of Dallas . She takes 10 medications every day because she 's had two organ transplant procedures , and the drugs are part of her daily regimen to survive . After Obamacare passed , she was able quit her job at a big company and start a business with her husband , because she could finally get individual insurance .
`` This particular plan , the fact that they can not discriminate against me because of how I was born , was a lifesaver , literally , '' she says .
House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady told the Washington Times last month that consumers need n't worry . `` We can assure the American public that the plan they 're in right now , the Obamacare plans , will not end on Jan. 20 , that we 're going to be prepared and ready with new options tailored for them , '' he said .
Six new silos at Naracoorte are increasing the viability of malt barley as a crop for Limestone Coast farmers .
TE Storage and Logistics owner and director Tom Hage said the six large , flat-bottomed , fully sealed silos provide local producers storage for high-return crops such as malt barley , which is needed for domestic and international beer production .
The barley is stored at the silos before being transported to Cargill Malt Asia Pacific at Port Adelaide .
There , it is malted before being delivered to brewers .
The six silos , with combined capacity of 9390 tonnes , were built after TE Storage and Logistics received a $ 250,000 Regional Development Fund grant from the South Australian Government towards the $ 2.5 million project in November 2015 .
“ The grant gave us much-needed capital that allowed us to expand and provide a foundation for the growth of the malt barley industry in this region , ” Mr Hage said .
“ Farmers can grow more and deliver more . Their grain is stored in better conditions , leading to a better product . ”
Mr Hage said the Naracoorte expansion supported local producers in a region where efficient storage and transport of produce is critical to meeting the demands of customers further along the supply chain .
“ We 're the only storage facility for malt barley between Millicent and Keith , ” Mr Hage said .
“ Our presence here allows local growers to deliver increased volumes of specialised , higher-returning crops . ”
As the storage capacity has grown , so has the workforce . Three years ago , Mr Hage was one of two people working fulltime for the company ; now , he has six full-time and three part-time staff members supporting him .
TE Storage also stores edible beans in an 8,000-tonne shed . In addition , it has 10 126-tonne upright silos in which it stores a CSIRO-developed gluten-free barley , released in 2016 , that is exported to Germany .

As the NHL 's Western Conference careens to its April finish , it is not always easy to figure out how your team is faring , where it projects and what is coming up next . At The Hockey Writers , we 're here to help .
We 've put together a quick and simple view of the eight teams locked in this close race . It 'll be updated on Thursday , to reflect the results of the Monday-Wednesday games , and it 'll be updated on Monday to cover the Thursday-Sunday games .
In this offering , all eight teams are down to 10 games or fewer left , which means its time for the countdown .
We previously conceded the Nashville Predators , Winnipeg Jets and Vegas Golden Knights are in the playoffs . We said the Edmonton Oilers , Chicago Blackhawks , Arizona Coyotes and Vancouver Canucks are n't going to make it . None of the other eight Western Conference teams found their way onto either list .
All eight teams we discussed on Thursday are still in the playoff hunt , fighting for five playoff spots . We 'll cover these eight as long as each team remains in contention .
Our table indicates the points each team has and provides a projected season total , based on each team averaging one point per game in each remaining game .
In our last edition ( results through Wednesday , Mar . 14 ) , all eight teams projected within six points of each other . The last team in the hunt ( Calgary ) was a mere three points from a playoff spot , the top teams ( San Jose , Minnesota ) a mere four points from losing their playoff spot . This has changed , especially for Calgary . The Flames remain in the mix , but barely . They ca n't afford to merely tread water at this point – they need to go on a run to stay in contention . If they fail to do so in their next few games , they 'll be dropped from the group of contenders .
Notable Events , March 15-18
In Colorado 's 4-1 win on Thursday over St. Louis , Avalanche goalie Semion Varlamov stopped 44 of 45 shots on goal , including all 22 in the third period . He followed it up by stopping 37 of 38 in the Avs win over Detroit on Sunday .
It was a disappointing overtime loss for the Stars against Ottawa on Friday , but at least goalie Ben Bishop returned after a five-game absence . Alas , Bishop 's return was short-lived . He left the Sunday game against Winnipeg with an injury and early reports suggest he 'll miss most , if not all , of the remainder of the regular season .
In the Sharks ' 7-4 win over Calgary on Friday , Evander Kane posted his first career hat trick and finished the game with four goals . In the game , Calgary was down three with over six minutes left when head coach Glen Gulutzan pulled his goalie . With their net empty , the Flames scored to cut the deficit to two . A few minutes later , Gulutzan repeated the tactic but had the opposite result when the Sharks scored an empty net goal to seal the game .
On Saturday , New Jersey Devils goalie Keith Kinkaid pitched his first shutout of this season , against the Los Angeles Kings . Kinkaid now has four career shutouts , two against the Kings .
The Sharks completed their road trip against Vancouver with a win on Saturday , but more injury news proved concerning . Defenseman Joakim Ryan was unable to play . In the first period , Melker Karlsson went down with an injury , making him the fourth Sharks forward who is hurting . In the second period , defenseman Marc-Edouard Vlasic , perhaps the team 's most important player , took a hard shot and missed the rest of the game .
St. Louis pulled off a critical overtime win over the New York Rangers , but like the Sharks , had an unwelcome injury to a star player . Vladimir Taresenko left the game late in the first period with an upper-body injury . He missed the Blues come-from-behind overtime win on Sunday against Chicago .
The Blues have 10 games remaining and , on paper , the easiest schedule of the eight teams . They play four games against teams which wo n't make the playoffs . Of course , two of the four are against the Chicago Blackhawks . The Blackhawks do n't have a ton to play for , so ruining the season of a hated rival has to be a strong motivation .
Anaheim defenseman Josh Manson left Sunday 's game against New Jersey . His injury , if he has to miss much time , is problematic in light of the surgery to fellow defenseman Kevin Bieksa . Bieksa underwent hand surgery earlier in the week and will be out several weeks .
Calgary 's uphill battle might come without defenseman TJ Brodie , who left the game against Vegas on Sunday after taking a big hit from Ryan Reaves .
Four-Point Games
There are plenty of games where the eight teams will go head-to-head , with a potential four-point swing . Six of the eight teams have at least five of these games left on their schedule ( St. Louis and Calgary are the exceptions ) . We 'll let you know what happened the previous few days and what to look for in the days ahead .
Thursday-Sunday Results
Thursday : Avalanche 4 , Blues 1
Friday : Sharks 7 , Flames 4
Saturday : –
Sunday : –
Monday-Wednesday Upcoming Games
Monday : Kings v Wild
Tuesday : –
Wednesday : Ducks v Flames

PARIS ( Reuters ) - The Roman Catholic archbishop of Lyon acknowledged shortcomings in his response to a paedophilia scandal in his archdiocese and said more rigorous checks were in place to prevent past errors in the appointment of priests being repeated .
In an interview with Le Monde , published ahead of the Aug. 15 Feast of the Assumption celebration , Cardinal Philippe Barbarin reiterated that he had never concealed acts of sexual abuse by Father Bernard Preynat , a priest under his authority .
Preynat is accused of sexually abusing Catholic boy scouts during the 1980s and early 1990s . He is due to appear before a court next month . Preynat 's lawyer has said the priest admits the abuse but that the cases have passed the legal statute of limitations when they were reported .
Prosecutors in 2016 extensively questioned Barbarin , one of France 's top Catholic clerics , over why Preynat 's activities had not been reported to civil authorities earlier before dropping their investigation into allegations of a cover-up .
Barbarin told Le Monde he became aware of Preynat 's activities in 2007 . When he `` knocked on doors '' for advice nobody gave him a satisfactory answer , he said .
`` I myself realise that my response at the time was inadequate , '' Barbarin told the newspaper .
French cardinal Philippe Barbarin looks on as Pope Francis leads a special Jubilee audience for members of the diocese of the French city of Lyon in Paul VI hall at the Vatican July 6 , 2016 . Max Rossi
No priest would again be welcomed into his archdiocese without written assurance from their bishop that there was no complaint or criminal conviction against them , Barbarin said . Compulsory training has also been introduced for priests under his authority .
Barbarin has been summoned as a witness on the request of the victims who filed the complaint against Preynat .
Barbarin said he understood their anger .
`` Their suffering is as painful today as it was 30 years ago . For them , it is appalling and unacceptable that he was allowed to carry on serving as a priest , '' Barbarin said .
The archbishop said he respected next month 's summons and urged Pope Francis to meet the victims at a later date too
Sexual abuse of children by Roman Catholic priests first made headlines in the U.S. in 2002 , when a newspaper investigation revealed U.S. bishops had moved abusers from parish to parish instead of defrocking them .
Up to 600 more units planned for Vancouver with help of $ 66 million from the provincial government
Stack them up . Take them down . Move them around . Repeat .
What could easily pass as a description of the children 's toy Lego could also be a portrait of British Columbia 's latest tool in the fight against homelessness .
The province is turning to modular housing to help with a critical lack of short-term accommodation . Temporary modular housing involves the construction of small , self-contained living quarters , which can be shipped directly from a factory and quickly assembled .
Proponents applaud the technique not only for its cost savings , but also because it slashes delivery time from years to months .
“ I liken it to being six months from idea to occupancy , ” said Luke Harrison , CEO of the Vancouver Affordable Housing Agency .
Harrison 's organization has assembled 40 units , each about 23 square metres , in Vancouver as part of a pilot project .
Up to 600 more units are planned for the city with the help of $ 66 million from the provincial government . Another 2,000 modular units are planned across B.C . over two years .
Permanent housing can take years to get approved and built , but prefabricated modules can quickly be moved to new locations and reassembled in new configurations depending on local needs . As a result , vacant sites waiting to be developed are suddenly candidates for temporary complexes that can house 50 or more people .
“ It 's not a solution for everything , but it 's a great tool that we have in our arsenal now to deal with things like the homeless population that requires an urgent and critical response that just does n't come as easily through traditional forms of construction and development , ” Harrison said .

A recent homelessness survey of Metro Vancouver communities between 2011 and 2016 found the number of people without shelter grew by 40 per cent , to 4,211 people . That 's four times faster than general population growth over that same period , the survey said .
Ethel Whitty , Vancouver 's director of homelessness services , said the initiative marks a shift in the city 's approach to helping the homeless that promotes finding accommodation as a priority .
“ Up until recent years , it was thought that you had to house people who were ready for housing . They had to be dry and sober and , say , they had to have their goals organized , ” she said . “ Actually , people who are housed are much more likely to be able to organize their life plan . ”
Where to place modular complexes depends on a number of factors , including access to health care and transit , zoning , environmental factors and community consultation , she added .
Kathleen Llewellyn-Thomas , who oversees community services for the city , said housing is only one element of a broader overall program , which will include support workers and other resources for tenants .
Part of the inspiration for the project came from temporary camps and catering facilities used in the resource industry to house workers in remote locations . Vancouver 's pilot project used expertise from Horizon North , which operated in the industrial sector for years before expanding to residential and commercial development .
Scott Matson , the company 's chief financial officer , said the key to modular housing is the timeline .
“ Imagine Lego blocks being completed in a controlled and closed environment , in a manufacturing environment rather than an outdoor construction environment , shipped to site and assembled on site , ” Matson said .
The company builds the modules in Kamloops , B.C. , transports them on site by truck and assembles them using a crane .
He estimated the typical lifespan of a module to be as long as 25 years and said the aesthetic of residential projects are “ very , very different ” from work camps .
“ Once constructed , … you 'd be unable to tell that it was anything different than a regular apartment building or hotel complex . ”

The ongoing party nominations have proved to be a revelation in several aspects , but two factors clearly stand out : First , most voters have become politically conscious of inalienable democratic rights and are ready to weed out representatives they feel do not meet their expectations . Second , parties are still bound by personal interests at the expense of the ordinary members who continue to suffer from the ineptitude being experienced in the current primaries .
Signs that the voter has become smarter in making political interpretations can be adjudged from the high casualty toll of sitting MPs in the early stages of the ODM nominations .
Experts have predicted the primaries and the forthcoming General Election will no longer be business as usual for incumbents , based on the unenviable record of the current crop of legislators who have shown they value personal interests more than those of the people they serve .
The outgoing National Assembly will go down in history for a ravenous appetite to inflate their egos and pockets , and for passing controversial legislation .
It has been said our Constitution is one of the best in Africa , principally because it has restored sovereignty to the people , decentralised power through devolution , anchored the Bill of Rights and ensured the fair distribution of resources to the grassroots . However , arguments are constantly being raised that there are some areas where the Constitution can be manipulated or loopholes exploited , especially the Chapter on Leadership and Integrity and that on the doctrine of separation of powers .
As observed from the current Parliament , it appears MPs have arrogated themselves powers beyond those envisaged by the drafters of the supreme law . In their self-styled delusion of grandeur , the legislators have often stood up to the Judiciary—the final arbiter in the constitutional triumvirate that includes the Legislature and the Executive .
Perhaps this is the reason voters are unhappy with the majority of MPs and senators who have been partisan and uncompromising on matters of national interest regardless of ethnic background , political mien or socio-economic status .
Pundits are attributing this imbroglio to many MPs ' unbridled arrogance and rapacious ways . This reputation will prove to be a political waterloo for the majority of the legislators as they face a serious backlash from angry voters more than willing to drop the axe on unscrupulous politicians .
Devolution has also seen similar tendencies displayed by legislators creeping into the counties . Again , voters at the grassroots have also become wiser and governors and MCAs may as well face the wrath of a tired electorate .
Change is in the air and the democratic space vastly expanded . Kenyans are demanding a more responsive leadership and not one based on personality cults , deceit and the kind of disorganisation being witnessed in the conduct of the party nominations .
Political leaders have succeeded in mobilising their supporters to blindly back them and their parties for selfish motives only to abandon them once elected .
This dubious distinction can be interpreted from the high turnover of political parties following the decline of the former ruling party Kanu and the advent of multiparty democracy . The headache of conducting credible and free nominations continues to haunt parties .
Parties can not afford to sweep issues under the carpet any more . Parties belong to the people , and not politicians . Leaders must organise their parties into democratic institutions that instil trust . The first step would be to the grassroots , the village and ward levels and sort out matters pertaining to party recruitment and members ' registration .

SANTA CLARA , Calif. -- Every morning when San Francisco 49ers safety Eric Reid and his teammates walk into the team facility , they can look at just about any wall and see photos of 49ers legends such as receiver Jerry Rice and quarterback Steve Young .
On Monday , Reid & Co. did n't have to settle for looking to a picture for inspiration . They got the real thing . Rice and Young attended the team 's Monday practice and also took some time to speak at the team meeting on Monday morning .
The focus of that speech ? How to re-establish the winning culture of previous 49ers glory days .
`` It was really cool because their pictures [ are ] all over this building , '' Reid said . `` They were just talking about that culture , how they did things and how everybody had each other 's back no matter what the situation was . Not like ' I have got your back because you all ca n't handle it and you all are playing terribly today . ' It 's ' I got your back because we are in this together and we are going to dig each other out of this hole if we have a bad situation or a bad game . ' So it 's pretty cool to see them talking about it . ''
Reid recounted a story Young told about how he went to the team facility three days after the 49ers won Super Bowl XXIX because he was bored only to walk on the field and find Rice running routes . The same Rice who just a few days earlier had 10 catches for 149 yards and three touchdowns .

`` [ Young ] asked him what he was doing and he said , 'Man , somebody is coming to get my job next year , ' '' Reid said . `` He 's fresh off the Super Bowl and he 's training for the next one . That 's why he 's the greatest . ''
After the team meeting , Rice and Young took in the practice , though in very different ways . Rice put on some 49ers training gear , gloves and cleats and went through a practice like he was a 54-year-old rookie trying to make the team . He ran routes and caught passes with the rest of the receivers during individual drills and went through reps in team drills from the side as though he was about to get his chance to actually play again .
Along the way , Rice stopped to give some instructions to receivers such as Marquise Goodwin and Kendrick Bourne . Rice and Bourne discussed their similar paths to the NFL , with both coming from smaller schools and having underwhelming 40-yard dash times .
`` He told me to just focus on route running , '' Bourne said . `` That 's really what it comes down to in this league is separation , getting that little bit of separation . A lot of times you are not going to be wide open like my touchdown [ against the Chiefs on Friday ] was , I happened to make the guy fall but that 's not going to happen every time , especially at the level I 'm playing at now . Just getting that little separation was what he thought was key . ''
When the 49ers hired coach Kyle Shanahan and general manager John Lynch in January , both made it clear that one of their goals was to open the door to past greats and make sure they feel welcome . Young attended some of the offseason program and other former 49ers have stopped by in the time since .
It 's something Reid believes can help the 49ers begin anew .
`` I think it does , '' Reid said . `` When you talk about culture , to have those guys here who have won the Super Bowl , who knew what it took , it 's all about the vibe . When you walk in the building and you see those faces and it 's like 'Man , that 's greatness right there ' and you ask them how they did it and they can give you little nuggets or things that you may not have thought of before that will help you with your game . To have Jerry Rice out there , standing there in cleats , it had to be cool for the receivers to see that . It was cool for me . It was huge . ''

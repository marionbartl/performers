A Canadian data expert who set off an international uproar over the alleged leak of private Facebook user data lost his job years ago in the office of former Liberal leader Michael Ignatieff , in large part because he was pushing a nascent form of the controversial data-harvesting technique , says a former senior party insider .
Christopher Wylie , a 28-year-old originally from British Columbia , has told news outlets of how the inappropriately obtained private information of tens of millions of Facebook users helped political movements score 2016 victories in the U.S. election and the U.K. 's Brexit referendum .
Wylie has said he played a pivotal role in those efforts and maintains his ideas made a key contribution to the creation of Cambridge Analytica , the company at the centre of the data-mining projects .

The outcry has sparked fresh debate about how far political parties should be allowed to go when profiling voters .
Years ago , when he was working in Ignatieff 's office , Wylie had already begun to develop strategies on how politicians could capitalize on data collected through social media , said a former senior Liberal insider who spoke on condition of anonymity .
WATCH : Facebook data misused to sway voters in 2016 election : Reports
At the time , the idea was viewed as too invasive and raised concerns with the Liberals , who declined to have anything to do with it , said the insider : Wylie 's recommended data-collection approach spooked party officials to the point that it became an significant factor behind their decision not to renew his contract in 2009 .
“ Let 's say he had boundary issues on data even back then , ” said the source , who noted that Wylie 's recent descriptions of his methods in media reports sounded familiar .
“ He effectively pitched an earlier version of exactly this to us back in 2009 and we said , ‘ No. ” ‘
Some of his ideas may not have even been fully possible at the time , but the “ whip-smart ” Wylie appears to have continued to pursue them , said the insider .

Wylie , who left Cambridge Analytica in 2014 , has not responded to repeated interview requests from The Canadian Press .
Reports by The New York Times and The Observer of London say U.S. President Donald Trump 's 2016 campaign hired Cambridge Analytica to collect private information from the Facebook profiles of more than 50 million users .
The reports say the firm exploited private social media activity to help allow the Trump campaign to better target voters by profiling their behaviour and personalities ahead of the U.S. election .
On Saturday , Trump 's campaign denied using the firm 's data , saying it relied on the Republican National Committee for its information .
In a statement Monday , Cambridge Analytica “ strongly denied ” the allegations that it had improperly obtained Facebook data . It also denied that the Facebook data was used by the Trump campaign and says it did n't work on the Brexit referendum .
The company insisted Wylie was a contractor , not a founder .
For Facebook , the controversy appears to be taking a toll . On Monday , Facebook shares fell US $ 12.53 or 6.77 per cent to US $ 172.56 on the New York Stock Exchange .
Facebook has denied the data collection was a breach because people knowingly provided their information . The company has said University of Cambridge psychology professor Aleksandr Kogan accessed the information after he requested it from users who gave their consent when they chose to sign up for his test via his Facebook app .
READ MORE : Republicans concerned about Trump 's political consultants accessing Facebook data
Facebook has also said it would ban Cambridge Analytica , saying the company improperly obtained information from 270,000 people who downloaded Kogan 's app . Facebook first learned of the breach more than two years ago , but has n't disclosed it until now .
On Monday , Facebook said it hired a digital forensics firm to conduct a comprehensive audit of Cambridge Analytica to determine if the Facebook data the company collected still exists or if it 's been destroyed . Cambridge Analytica agreed to give the auditor complete access to its servers and systems , Facebook said .
The social-media giant said it 's also asked Wylie and Kogan to submit to an audit as well . It said Kogan has given his verbal agreement to do so and Wylie has declined .
The Facebook data breach exposed by Wylie in recent days has caused a commotion on both sides of the Atlantic and has caught the attention of Canada 's privacy watchdog .
“ Recent media reports regarding the use of personal information posted on Facebook for political purposes raise serious privacy concerns , ” Privacy Commissioner Daniel Therrien said in the statement .
“ Our office will be reaching out to Facebook to seek information regarding whether Canadians ' personal information was affected by the issues raised in those reports . That will help us determine possible next steps . ”
Therrien also said his office has offered to assist an investigation into the matter already launched by the U.K. information commissioner 's office . He said his ultimate goal is to ensure that the privacy rights of Canadian Facebook users are protected .

Asked Monday about the possible Facebook breach , Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale said the government will take every step to protect the integrity of the Canadian democratic system .
“ When an issue like that emerges , we all need to take it very , very seriously , make sure we get the facts and respond accordingly , ” Goodale said in Ottawa .
“ This is a rapidly moving , rapidly evolving situation because of technology . What we know or think we know today is likely to be radically different six months from now . And we have to be alert to every twist and turn along the way . ”
On Monday , Wylie told NBC 's Today in an interview that Cambridge Analytica used data to create profiling algorithms that enabled the company to “ explore mental vulnerabilities of people. ” It enabled the firm to inject information into different forms of online content , so that people saw things that may not have been true , he said .
“ This is a company that really took fake news to the next level , ” Wylie said .
He also said he had left Cambridge Analytica before it joined the Trump campaign . But he added he knew the company met with Trump 's former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski in 2015 , before Trump had announced his candidacy .
Iowa Sen. Joni Ernst says `` it 's very frustrating '' that it took President Donald Trump two days to specifically denounce white supremacy in the wake of a deadly clash in Virginia .
The Republican freshman senator spoke to reporters after a town hall meeting of about 100 people in Fort Dodge in northwest Iowa . Trump finally condemned hate groups by name on Monday , after first offering a less specific criticism of groups involved in Saturday 's protests in Charlottesville .
Ernst credited Trump with adequately addressing the problem Monday , but wished it had n't taken so long .
She said the statement was `` strong , '' but that `` I wish he had been right out the gate with that . ''
Saline County is still under a burn ban and high wildfire danger . County Judge Jeff Arey originally issues the countywide ban on Nov. 27 .
Due to extremely dry weather conditions and the increase in probability for wildfires , a ban on open burning has been issued to protect lives and property , '' Arey said in a release announcing the ban .
Unfortunately , conditions have not changed .
Because dry conditions will continue during this week and no significant rain is expected , much of state will remain under a burn ban , according to the National Weather Service .
Wildfire danger also will likely increase until there is widespread rain .
`` This ban prohibits all controlled burns , burn barrels , open fires in campfire rings and burn pits . While outdoor cooking is enclosed charcoal or gas grills is permitted , citizens are urged to maintain supervision on these activities at all times , '' Arey said .

ISLAMABAD , June 14 ( APP ) : Prime Minister Muhammad Nawaz
Sharif , in order to revive the country 's film industry , on
Wednesday announced a special package for the artists and
workers associated with it .
“ Reviving the film Industry was our top most obligation .
It gives me immense pleasure to announce the biggest ever
special package in the history of Pakistan for the artists and
workers associated with this industry , which surely is the
fulfillment of yet another promise like our other pledges , ”
the Prime Minister said in a statement issued here on Wednesday .
He said art and artists were those trustees of the
bright traditions of the Pakistani society which had played a
significant role in keeping alive the national identity ,
culture and heritage at the global level , besides carving a
niche for Pakistan among the alive and conscientious nations .
“ Unfortunately Pakistan and its self-respecting people
have witnessed heinous acts of terrorism in the streets ,
mosques and public places during the last many years . But by
the grace of God owing to the sacrifices of our valiant forces
and security agencies and unswerving determination of the
nation , terrorism has been stopped in its tracks and incidents
of terrorism have been considerably reduced , ” he added .
The Prime Minister said the recent history was witness
to the fact how enemies of Islam and the country targeted the
innocent minds with misleading concepts , which promoted
terrorism in the country .
“ The comity of nations interpreted our distorted
identity according to their own perceptions , ” he added .
The Prime Minister said , “ The youth who are the future
of this country remained captive of a scary mindset . To
extricate the youth from that horrible situation and
terrorism , we are trying to provide alternative avenues of
entertainment to them . ”
“ We are aware of the fact that quality entertainment
revolves around availability of playing fields , recreations
parks , tourism and cultural activities , the nucleus of which
is the revival of the film industry , ” he added .
The Prime Minister said he felt proud to accord status
of industry to the amorous body of films on the
recommendations of the Ministry of Information , Broadcasting
and National Heritage , which was the continuation of the
policy that they announced in 1992 .
“ Apart from this , relaxation in financial laws
pertaining to films and exemption from taxes should also be
given . The domain of art and literature includes all those
honourbale people we call writers and poets , ” he added .
The Prime Minister said a comprehensive package will
also be prepared for these honourable personalities and fine
arts . Under this package National Film and Broadcasting
Commission , National Film Institute and an academy will be
established that will have a studio equipped with the latest
technology and gadgets compatible with the requirements of the
modern times , he added .
For the welfare and financial assistance to the artists ,
the Prime Minister also announced the establishment of Prime
Minister 's Artist Welfare Fund so that the dignity and self-
respect of those talented individuals could be safeguarded .
“ Each nook and cranny of this land of the pure testifies
to the beauty of God . In this context the foreign filmmakers
will be given special concession for making films on cultural ,
historic and tourists spots , so that through this medium
tourism at the national and international level can be
promoted , ” he added .
The Prime Minister said special concession will be given
on the import of equipment related to the film industry , so
that the bright and beautiful face of Pakistan could be shown
to the world and the Pakistani film producers had all the
facilities available at home for which they had to go abroad .
“ We have to go even beyond this with a view to ensure
that every person connected with this industry is duly
encouraged . In this context the government has decided to
accord complete exemption on entertainment tax . More
concessions will be made in regards to the income related to
film and entertainment , ” he added .
The Prime Minister said special benefits and
concessions will also be allowed on investments in such
ventures which help in introducing our dignified past ,
exemplary heritage , worth emulating culture , distinguished
literature and infallible beauty of tourism to the youth , who
are architects of our future .
“ To help the film and Broadcasting Industry and the fine
arts I announce the institution of Prime Minister 's Film
Finance Fund which I am sure is a rare step , ” he added .
The Prime Minister said he was sanguine that the
inclusion of the film and Broadcasting Industry in the
national milieu would give further boost to the Pakistan
economy which was already striding on the path of sustained
economic development .
“ I am confident that these steps taken at the level of
the government will go a long way in removing the difficulties
and impediments connected to the film Industry . I am also
proud of the fact that our land has produced such
personalities in the field of fine arts whose imprint will
help different nations to move ahead for all times to come , ”
he added .
He was hopeful that our youth , like in other fields ,
will spare no effort to make their contribution in the domain
of films to win laurels for Pakistan . In this endeavour they
will always find the elected government standing with them , he
added .
The Prime Minister directed the Ministry of Information ,
Broadcasting and National Heritage to present this package in
implementable form for the approval of the government , after
consultations with the Ministry of Finance and other relevant
institutions .
Netherlands town honours Cambridge pilot Donald Taylor 63 years after fatal crash
Supplied This plaque to honour Flying Officer Donald Taylor is on the wall of the address of the house where he crashed in Europe , in 1945 .
A piece of a glass from the cockpit of Donald Taylor 's Spitfire is all that 's left of the crash which took his life , and three others , during World War II .
People living in The Netherlands town of Haren , where RNZAF Flying Officer Donald Graeme Lane Taylor died , would not have met the Cambridge man all those years ago .
But some of the town 's older citizens still remembered the night his plane crashed and recently they honoured Taylor 's memory , joining a Kiwi relative of the pilot to unveil a plaque there .
Supplied A photo taken during World War II showing the rail yards which were the focus of Donald Taylor 's squadron attack and the water tower which his Spitfire clipped .
Taylor grew up in Cambridge around Vogel Street and attended Cambridge Primary School and Cambridge District High School .
He enlisted for service in 1942 .
Supplied Rae and Colin Holmes stand behind the headstone of Colin 's uncle , Donald Taylor .
He was a popular and well-known man about town before he set off for war . He was keen on rugby , tennis , swimming and shooting .
At the official farewell from Cambridge , at the Patriotic Committee Dance , Taylor made a farewell speech on behalf of 26 men who were leaving for active service .
It was in February , 1945 , that 21-year-old Taylor was flying a reconnaissance night-time mission over Groningen-Zwolle , in the Netherlands .
Mike Bain/Stuff Donald Lane , a cul-de-sac off Vogel Street in Cambridge was named in memory of Donald Taylor .
At Onnen , 6km southeast of Groningen , the squadron strafed a small marshalling yard which had a locomotive repair workshop adjacent .
The Spitfires attacked a departing train , pulled up , turned and came in for another pass .
It was during this manouevre Taylor took his plane low , one of its wings clipped a water tower as it passed , causing it to crash .
Supplied RNZAF Flying Officer Donald Taylor left Cambridge as a 21 year old and never returned .
In May , a plaque was unveiled by Taylor 's nephew Colin Holmes , as a memorial to the Kiwi pilot .
The journey from Taylor 's death , to the unveiling of the plaque , had taken 63 years .
Dutch researcher Dirk Munk worked on updating the details of Taylor 's death , which prompted him to search for relatives of the pilot .
His journey led him to the Cambridge Museum where he found a family photo of Taylor among its records .
Munk then contacted a now 69-year-old Colin Holmes living at Mount Maunganui .
Holmes said he was surprised as since childhood wondered what happened to his mother 's brother , who did n't return from the war .
`` Once contacted I had to find out more and we started a year-long chain of correspondence , '' Holmes said .
Holmes indicated he would like to visit the grave of his uncle .
He had an opportunity when he was in Europe and made arrangements .
`` It was very emotional for me . I unveiled a plaque in remembrance of my uncle on the wall of the address where he had crashed .
`` I spent some time speaking with four men who were in their teens in 1945 , who watched the plane clip the water tower , eventually smashing through a row of trees and crashing into a house killing three railway workers .
`` I heard how locals tried to save my uncle from the burning wreck , but it was too late , they said . ''
One of them , Peter Vos , recovered some plexiglass from the cockpit .
`` At the remembrance , Peter came up to me and gave me a piece of the glass he still had for a memento , '' Holmes said .
`` It was special to be able to speak to people who were there on that day and see with my own eyes .
`` It is unbelievable how many memories people still have of that day .
`` The fact people from all over the world were prepared to rise to the challenge the war presented and give their lives for people they had never met , will always be remembered . ''

CALGARY/LONDON ( Reuters ) - Gold rose to a one-week high on Wednesday , extending the prior session 's rebound from a seven-month low , helped by a softer U.S. dollar and smoldering trade policy tensions , though the prospect of the Federal Reserve raising interest rates further may limit gains .
The U.S. dollar index fell against a basket of major currencies , while the Chinese yuan rose for a second day with central bank support , after seeing an 11-month low this week . [ FRX/ ]
A weaker U.S. dollar makes dollar-priced gold cheaper for non-U.S. investors .
`` Gold has been trending lower for several weeks and this being ( U.S ) non-farm payrolls ( week ) the dollar is likely to remain in range , so people are taking profit on dollar and gold positions , '' said Fawad Razaqzada , an analyst at FOREX.com .
`` I 'm still not convinced we 've seen the lows so long as gold remains below $ 1,300 . The dollar is on an upwards trajectory . I do n't think ( looming U.S. interest rate ) hikes are fully priced into the dollar or gold . ''
Spot gold was up 0.3 percent at $ 1,256.20 an ounce by 1:59 p.m. EDT ( 17:59 GMT ) after touching $ 1,261.10 , a one-week high . The yellow metal has gained over $ 20 from Tuesday 's low of $ 1,237.32 an ounce , its weakest since Dec. 12 .
U.S. gold futures for August delivery rose 0.4 percent to $ 1,258.10 in a shortened session and will not have a settlement price due to the U.S . Independence Day holiday on Wednesday .
Investors are now looking to minutes of the June U.S. Federal Reserve meeting due for publication on Thursday and the U.S. non-farm payrolls and unemployment data on Friday for further cues on monetary policy . Markets are pricing in two more Fed interest rate hikes for 2018 .
World stocks were flat amid growing anxiety ahead of Washington 's end of week deadline to impose tariffs on Chinese imports .
`` Since the trade wars have been doing the rounds , if anything we 've seen gold come lower . But if it continues to escalate gold could go only one way and that 's higher , '' a Sydney-based trader said .
China is putting pressure on the European Union to issue a strong joint statement against U.S. President Donald Trump 's trade policies at a summit later this month but is facing resistance , European officials said .
Gold is often regarded as a safe haven during times of political and financial uncertainty .
Silver was 0.1 percent higher at $ 16.03 an ounce and palladium gained 0.7 percent to $ 946 .
Platinum was flat at $ 837 an ounce . The metal fell on Tuesday to the lowest since December 2008 at $ 793 .

Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu , leader of the main opposition Republican People 's Party ( CHP ) , is no stranger to controversy when it comes to his remarks about women . Retorts he blurted out to female lawmakers he was arguing with at a parliamentary session yesterday were yet another instance of misogyny which drew widespread condemnation . Female lawmakers openly targeted by the politician held a joint press conference to denounce Kılıçdaroğlu while a prominent women 's nonprofit organization issued a scathing statement with references to `` dire '' instances of his hatred and discrimination toward women .
`` Get out of here , go back home if you are going to do gossip , '' Kılıçdaroğlu told a group of female lawmakers from the ruling Justice and Development ( AK ) Party during a parliamentary debate before uttering `` Do you have a special problem ? ''
Nine female lawmakers held a joint press conference immediately after the session , criticizing Kılıçdaroğlu for `` insulting women . '' Hüsnüye Erdoğan , a lawmaker for central city of Konya , said they were discussing the transfer of CHP lawmakers to another opposition party when Kılıçdaroğlu lashed out at them . `` We did n't answer him at the time as we did not want to stoop to his level . We do n't have a 'problem ' as he says but he apparently has one and this disturbs Turkish public . This is an insult against all women , '' she said . Ayşe Sula Köseoğlu , a lawmaker for northern city of Trabzon , said that they opposed `` remarks degrading women . ''
Kılıçdaroğlu is known as a gaffe-prone politician with a history of misspelling names of his constituency and verses of national anthem but his controversial remarks on a string of issues is no laughing matter for many . The incident came a few days after the opposition politician slammed Ottomans for `` cruelty '' that drew the ire of a nation still respectful of the now-defunct empire .
His remarks about women in the ruling party in the past are deemed borderline sexist and degrading for his critics . Last year , he was ordered by court to pay compensation for his 2016 insult to then-minister of family and social policies Sema Ramazanoğlu . `` The minister of family does not talk because she knelt before someone , '' Kılıçdaroğlu has said then .
Women and Democracy Association ( KADEM ) , a leading women 's non-profit organization , said in a written statement yesterday that enough was enough with Kılıçdaroğlu 's `` discriminatory and hateful speech toward women . ''
Referring to his `` dire '' statement that `` legitimized violence towards women '' by saying unemployed men would `` of course '' beat their wives , '' activists said they did not want to `` witness the shame of [ Kılıçdaroğlu ] 'put women in their place ' again . ''
`` He almost told the female lawmakers that they should stay at home rather than serving at the parliament . He tried to degrade them by saying they were gossip mongers , '' the statement said .

As per Election Commission of Pakistan there are 396 polling stations across Kashmore .
However , PS-4 has 145 polling stations , PS-5 122 and 129 of PS-6 Tangwani .
There are no doubt that Kashmore district always have remained stronghold of the PPP .
However , a notification on Friday was issued by the returning officer Kandhkot that ex MNA of PPP Mir Shabir Ali has been declared as unopposed winner on PS-6 Tangwani .
Shabir Ali is a single candidate throughout Pakistan who had been declared unopposed winner of 2018 general election .
According to observing there will be tough contesting between two PPP candidate Mir Abid Khan and Hafiz Rabnawaz Chachar candidate of MMA PS-5 Kandhkot constituency .
However , Mir Ghalib Khan PTI candidate will be contesting the 25 July election from Sindh Assembly constituency PS-4 Kashmore . Moreover , candidates of various parties launched campaigns for the election throughout district .
Even they initiated public gatherings and corner meetings in their respective areas . It was observed that different communities of Kashmore , Kandhkot and Tangwani have announced of supporting senior politician and PPP leader Sardar Saleem 's candidates for NA-197 ex MNA Ihsan Ur Rahman and ex-MPA Abdul Rauf Khoso for PS-4 .
However they were belonged to the PPP . It is worthy to mention here that Kashmore district is the Tribal and bordering areas of Sindh Punjab and Sindh Balochistan due to this that is main district if Sindh .
Three big tribes Mazari , Bijarani and Sundrani are the powerful and strongest tribes of the area . It is fact that all those above belonging to the PPP last for several decades .
Now here a question creates that with coalition of GDA , PTI and MMA across Sindh PPP will experience huge loss and strong resistance .

Today , their main role has n't changed . They 're spread all over the globe and used by most of us to meet friends , relax and enjoy a good cup of coffee or a snack , but as well by artists and freelancers who need a more bohemian atmosphere to get inspiration for their work .

The Federal Reserve is proposing to ease a rule aimed at defusing the kind of risk-taking on Wall Street that helped trigger the 2008 financial meltdown .
The Fed under new leadership on Wednesday unveiled proposed changes to the Volcker Rule , which bars banks ' risky trading bets for their own profit with depositors ' money . The changes would match the strictest applications of the rule to banks that do the most trading .
Fed officials say that would resolve some of the uncertainty for banks . It comes amid other government efforts to loosen financial regulations , as President Donald Trump has promised .
The Volcker Rule , crafted by regulators 4 ½ years ago , is a key plank of the landmark Dodd-Frank law intended to reduce the likelihood of another financial crisis and taxpayer-funded bank bailout . Trump has blamed Dodd-Frank for constraining economic growth .
The rule is named for Paul Volcker , a Fed chairman in the 1980s who was an adviser to President Barack Obama during the financial crisis . Volcker urged a ban on deposit-funded , high-risk trading by big banks , believing that it would be an effective in averting future economic crises .
There has already been a volley of modifications that unwind the stricter regulations put into place during the Great Recession :
—Last week , Congress approved legislation rolling back the Dodd-Frank law , giving Trump a key win on a campaign promise as he quickly signed it into law . The Republican-led legislation , passed with help from some opposition votes , was aimed at especially helping small and medium-sized banks , including community banks and credit unions . It eases oversight and capital requirements ( and Volcker Rule compliance ) for about two dozen banks falling below new capital thresholds , including BB & T Corp. , SunTrust Banks , Fifth Third Bancorp and American Express .
—After Trump installed him in November as acting director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau , Mick Mulvaney has shaped the watchdog agency established by the Dodd-Frank law and urged a curb on its powers . He has dropped a lawsuit against a payday lender , targeted agency enforcement powers in anti-discrimination cases and threatened a consumer complaint database . No banks or other financial institutions have been fined or sued since he took over .
The Volcker Rule banned high-risk activity known as proprietary trading . The practice had become a huge money-making machine for Wall Street mega-banks like Goldman Sachs , JPMorgan Chase and Morgan Stanley . Proprietary trading allowed big banks to tap depositors ' money in federally-insured bank accounts — essentially borrowing against that money and using it for investments .
`` Weakening the Volcker Rule means allowing banks to play with other people 's money again . That was the casino economy before the crisis , '' says Ed Mierzwinski , a senior director at the U.S. Public Interest Research Group , a consumer advocacy organization
In the years since the rule took effect , banks have been required to trade mainly on behalf of their clients .
`` The proprietary trading desks are gone ( from the banks ) and they 're probably not going to come back , '' says Oliver Ireland , an attorney specializing in banking law at Morrison & Foerster . Ireland was an associate general counsel at the Fed .
Still , big Wall Street banks have pushed against the Volcker Rule .
The Fed is an independent regulator that asserts its separation from political pressure and the White House . Trump , of course , has had the opportunity to put his stamp on the central bank by filling positions on the seven-member Fed board .
The new Fed chairman since February , Jerome Powell , who was a board member under ex-Fed chair Janet Yellen , was an investment banker before he joined the central bank . After Trump named him Fed chief , Powell told Congress that he believes the rules put into place after the 2008 crisis could be improved , though he does n't completely support the administration 's ambition of aggressively rolling back regulations .
Another Trump appointee on the Fed board , investment banker Randal Quarles , is the Fed 's top overseer of Wall Street and the leader in seeking to ease financial regulation . He has said the package of rules under Dodd-Frank should be overhauled but not scrapped . The third sitting Fed governor is Lael Brainard , a former Treasury Department official appointed by Obama in 2014 .
Trump has named three others to fill vacancies on the board : two economics professors and the Kansas banking commissioner . They await Senate confirmation .
New Delhi : A prominent leader of the Hindu Mahasabha and the Father of the Nation . People of foreign origin , and from all corners of the country . Four women , and three leaders assassinated .
The presidents of India 's grand old party have written their own chapters in history . As the Congress gets ready to welcome its new chief , 47-year-old Rahul Gandhi , the stage is being set for a change in guard after 19 years .
Of the 15 people who led the 132-year-old party post-Independence , four belonged to the Gandhi-Nehru family . When Gandhi takes over as the president , he will be the fifth .
The Nehru-Gandhi clan was at the helm of affairs of the party after independence for 38 years : Nehru for three years , Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi for eight years each , and Sonia Gandhi for a record 19 years .
Long before Independence , his great-great grandfather , Motilal , headed the party , the first from the family to do so .
The party has been helmed by some illustrious people -- including Mahatma Gandhi , Sardar Vallabbhai Patel , Subhash Chandra Bose , Abul Kalam Azad and Sarojini Naidu .
Womesh Chandra Bonnerjee , who wore several hats as journalist , jurist and politician , was the president of the first session of the Congress held in what was then Bombay in December 1885 . Dadabhai Naoroji was the second .
Decades before questions were raised about Sonia 's foreign origin , the party had five presidents who were not born in India .
According to “ Congress and the Making of Indian Nation ” , a two-volume set edited by former Congress leader and ex- president of India Pranab Mukherjee , Scottish merchant George Yule was the president of the party in 1888 and presided over the Allahabad session . Sir William Wedderburn , a former member of the Indian Civil Service , headed the party twice -- in 1889 and 1910 .
Alfred Webb , member of the House of Commons , Sir Henry Cotton , an ICS officer and chief commissioner of Assam , and Annie Besant , who started the Home Rule Movement , headed the Congress in 1894 , 1904 and 1917 respectively .
Madan Mohan Malviya , later one of the main leaders of the Hindu Mahasabha , presided over the Congress in 1909 and 1918 . Motilal Nehru , father of India 's first prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru , was party president in 1919 and 1928 . His son first took over the reins in 1929 , when the call for 'Poorna Swaraj ' was given at the Lahore session of the party .
After independence , the party was headed by four people from the Nehru-Gandhi family , and 11 who were not .
B Pattabhi Sitaramayya ( 1948 ) was followed by Purushottam Das Tandon ( 1949 ) and UN Dhebar ( 1955-59 ) . The others were N Sanjiva Reddy ( 1960-62 ) , K Kamaraj ( 1964-66 ) , S Nijalingappa ( 1968-69 ) , Jagjivan Ram ( 1969 ) , Shankar Dayal Sharma ( 1972 ) , DK Barooah ( 1975 ) , PV Narasimha Rao ( 1992-96 ) , and Sitaram Kesri ( 1997-98 ) .
Jawaharlal Nehru was the president of the party for three spells – in 1929 , 1936 and 1951-53 .
He was among the four party presidents who also headed the government – apart from his daughter , Indira , grandson Rajiv and Rao .
Indira held the post in 1959 and 1978-84 , her son Rajiv in 1984-91 and daughter-in-law Sonia Gandhi , from 1998 till date .
Political commentator Kumar Ketkar points out that there were several occasions when the prime minister clashed with the party president or with senior leaders .
“ There was a major difference of opinion between Nehru and Patel over the candidature of Purushottam Tandon in 1949 . While Patel backed Tandon , Nehru was against his nomination . This was the time when Nehru was prime minister and Patel home minister , ” he says .
He cites the example of Nijalingappa expelling Indira in 1969 .
`` When Indira was prime minister , she was sacked as a primary member of the Congress by then party president Nijalingappa , '' says Ketkar .
Suhas Palshikar , political analyst and co-director of the Lokniti programme of the Centre for the Study of Developing Societies , says even Jawaharlal Nehru was a towering figure in the Congress , he would take decisions through compromise .
“ Nehru allowed plurality of leaders . It was only after Indira came that dynasty took root in the Congress and the mantle was passed on to Rajiv , ” Palshikar says .
But the installation of Rajiv Gandhi 's wife , Sonia , as party president was not exactly an outcome of dynasty politics , he believes .
“ She was brought in as a leader who was acceptable to all at a time when the Congress was in disarray . But it can not be denied that she had the benefit of being from the Nehru-Gandhi family , ” Palshikar adds .
For the party , Rahul 's elevation as president is the start of a new chapter .
Good morning , and welcome to the Essential California newsletter . It 's Monday , Aug. 14 , and here 's what 's happening across California :
TOP STORIES
A sticking point
Despite a strict new California law , hundreds of schools still do n't have enough vaccinated kids . At nearly 750 schools , 90 % or fewer kindergartners had been fully vaccinated last year , an analysis by the Los Angeles Times found . Experts say the rate should be at least 95 % to prevent the spread of highly contagious diseases such as measles . Los Angeles Times
Affirmative action resurfaces
A debate about affirmative action has emerged in the campaign for governor , threatening to inject a potentially volatile racial element into the 2018 contest after the issue divided California Democrats along ethnic lines three years ago . The question of whether race should be considered in admissions to California 's colleges and universities was raised in recent weeks when the state 's Latino and black legislative caucuses sent a letter to the top six gubernatorial candidates . Los Angeles Times
Plus : For Assembly Republican Leader Chad Mayes and his allies , voting for the extension of cap and trade was a bid to show voters that Republicans are serious about tackling an issue important to Californians . But for conservative critics , the entire episode was a betrayal of party principles and a tactical blunder . Los Angeles Times
Pot cases are beginning to be thrown out
In a first-of-its-kind ruling , a federal judge in San Francisco halted a marijuana case last week against two men who had already pleaded guilty to drug charges but had yet to be sentenced . The judge found he had no choice but to call off prosecutors in light of an unusual budget rule in Congress that forbids federal law enforcement from interfering with states where medical marijuana is legal . The move is being hailed by pot supporters who hope it will add a new roadblock to any attempt by the Trump administration to crack down on the drug . Los Angeles Times

IMMIGRATION AND THE BORDER
Big border story : In many ways , the story of the transformation of the U.S.-Mexico border around San Diego from a kind of lawless , latter-day Ellis Island into a forsaken backwater reflects the nation 's incendiary debate about illegal immigration — its high emotion , challenges and cost , both in resources and lives , and the inherent contradictions and misperceptions .

For two weeks a hacker has leaked stolen information from pay-TV network HBO in dribs and drabs , including “ Game of Thrones ” plot lines , un-aired episodes of “ Curb Your Enthusiasm ” and , reportedly , actors ' personal information .
The incremental data dumps have caused prolonged and widespread anxiety in Hollywood about the entertainment industry 's vulnerability to cybercrime , following recent attacks — and , occasionally , bogus threats — against the likes of Netflix and Walt Disney Co .
So far , though , it appears that the damage to HBO has been less than the hacker originally advertised . HBO says it is not negotiating with the hacker , and much of the stolen material does not appear to be easily accessible to the general public , severely limiting the impact of the breach .
In the latest round of leaks , a hacker going by the name “ Mr . Smith ” sent media outlets , including the Los Angeles Times , links to video files containing multiple episodes of the long-awaited ninth season of “ Curb Your Enthusiasm , ” which is scheduled to debut in October . Other affected shows include “ Insecure ” and “ Ballers . ”
However , it 's still unclear if people other than journalists have been able to access the pilfered material . Tech website TorrentFreak said it had scoured multiple piracy portals online and had yet to find the new episodes .
“ It appears that the various journalists who received the latest batch of ... links are not very eager to post them in public , ” the site said in a blog post .
Moreover , the new batch did not contain episodes from HBO 's flagship program “ Game of Thrones , ” which draws millions of viewers a week . In previous rounds , the hacker released preliminary outlines for upcoming “ Game of Thrones ” episodes .
To be sure , the attack is still a major headache for HBO , which acknowledged the incident last month , saying it was working with law enforcement and outside security experts . Hackers claimed to have swiped 1.5 terabytes of information , including episodes and internal documents such as emails . HBO Chief Executive Richard Plepler told employees that there was no evidence that the company 's email system has been compromised .
Stolen emails were a source of much embarrassment for top executives in the aftermath of the Sony hack . Even worse were the troves of personal data , including healthcare information , that Sony 's attackers unleashed onto the Web . In October 2015 , Sony agreed to settle a class-action lawsuit by paying up to $ 8 million to reimburse employees for identity-theft losses , preventive measures and legal fees .
HBO , in a pointed statement Sunday , said the hacker responsible for the breach is putting out material piece by piece to sustain media attention .
” We are not in communication with the hacker and we 're not going to comment every time a new piece of information is released , ” HBO said . “ The hacker may continue to drop bits and pieces of stolen information in an attempt to generate media attention . That 's a game we 're not going to participate in . ”
“ Obviously , no company wants their proprietary information stolen and released on the Internet . Transparency with our employees , partners and the creative talent that works with us has been our focus throughout this incident and will remain our focus as we move forward . ”
HBO had sent a note to the hacker offering $ 250,000 to participate in the company 's “ bug bounty ” program , in which computer experts are paid for pointing out vulnerabilities , but that appears to have been a delay tactic .
For HBO , one challenge right now may be to make sure the attack is over , and that additional material is n't vulnerable to theft , said Brian Finch , a Washington , D.C. , lawyer and lobbyist specializing in cybersecurity issues . “ You need to be prepared to … identify what was actually taken versus what was just alleged to be taken , ” he said .

“ The Legend of Zelda ” fans can soon get their hands on a lovely Hylian Shield version of the New Nintendo 2DS XL . It 's coming exclusively to GameStop stores on July 2 for $ 159.99 .
The New Nintendo 2DS XL is a streamlined version of the New Nintendo 3DS XL released in 2015 . It has most of the features of its larger brother , including its clamshell model , faster processor , and amiibo support , but it comes without the 3DS ' autostereoscopic display . It comes pre-loaded with “ The Legend of Zelda : A Link Between Worlds ” and can play the entire library of Nintendo 3DS games in 2D , along with the Nintendo DS ' back catalog .
During a recent financial results briefing , Nintendo president Tatsumi Kimishima said the 3DS family of systems has sold a cumulative 72 million units globally . But the company seemed uncertain about its fate back in February . At the time , Kimishima said he hoped consumers would embrace the system together with the Nintendo Switch , “ but as for what transpires in the future , that is uncharted territory . ”
The Nintendo Switch is a hybrid console that can be played on a big screen or in handheld mode . It sold nearly 18 million units in the last fiscal year , and Nintendo thinks it can move 20 million more in the coming year . It 's more powerful than the 3DS family of systems , but 3DS ' price point is undoubtedly more attractive to cash-strapped gamers or families with small children . A good indication of Nintendo 's continuing support will come during E3 next month , when it reveals what projects it 's working on for all of its consoles .
I had to pause and respond to the Hon . Prime Minister of Dominica , Mr. Roosevelt Skerrit , who , in my view , made some rather brazen public statements on Friday March 16 , 2018 .
The statements were given in reaction to an initiative taken by the union representing workers at Dominica 's Ports , the Dominica Public Service Union ( DPSU ) , to solicit a reaction from the authorities , the Dominica Air and Seaport Association ( DASPA ) .
Mr. Skerrit remarked that other interests might be behind the union 's move , that the workers were undertaking a lawless and selfish activity and that the country could not afford any salary interests in the wake of hurricane Maria , a category 5 weather system which had severely impacted the island . The PM also indicated , rather forcefully , that ‘ he ' would not negotiate with the union while the workers were taking “ industrial action . ”
Union members reported to work on March 16 , but withdrew their services for a brief moment . The reason for their action was blamed on the lack of response to a two-year old correspondence which the union had sent to DASPA on behalf of the members . But what really sparked the move was DASPA 's no-show at a scheduled meeting with the union earlier that week ; the union members demanded action . DASPA is a statutory corporation in charge of running Dominica 's port and Skerrit has no direct role to play in that corporation 's operations , or he should not .
In a discussion with Mr. Thomas Letang on the ongoing impasse , he advised me that DASPA 's CEO , Mr. Benoit Bardouille had assured him ( Letang ) of a meeting on Wednesday March 21 to address his union 's proposal . So , as a consequence , the union 's action was discontinued . Now , it is my view the statements were not only unwarranted , but they were untimely and probably even ill-advised .
Mr. Skerrit , based on my humble observation , continually asserts himself in such situations with the misguided illusion that he alone can move the system . And he simply can not , nor is he the system . This trend is worrying and the Mr. Skerrit deserves to be called-out as often as he does this sort of thing . It may be assumed that the Skerrit is a political actor who is consumed by his desires to maintain power “ for the next 10 , 20 , 30 , 40 years , ” to quote him directly . The question is : at what cost is he , and his enablers , willing to achieve this “ legacy ? ” I , therefore , felt the need to contribute to the ongoing debate with the view that such contributions keep the wheels of democracy turning .
It is my opinion that Mr. Skerrit tried , by this statement , to further assert himself as Dominica 's ‘ Strong Man , ' but he must be very careful not to miss the mark as to how far he can push the people . I am beginning to think that the Prime Minister 's antics might challenge him more negatively than it does his political opponents as time goes by . His move was a rather premature one which was generally aimed at maintaining prominence in Dominica 's political arena .
Bravo Thomas Letang ! I stand in solidarity with you , the DPSU , and the workers and people of Dominica . I also stand with and for they who do not believe that there is a cause to stand up for . Fear is a misconception of one 's own strength and the collective abilities of others . On the other hand , such show of resilience strengthens any democracy .

Universities were the most obviously politicized sites of generational identity in the long year of 1968 . Some campuses—Berkeley in California , Nanterre in Paris , Essex in Britain or the Free University in Berlin—became bywords for political radicalism . The occupation of university buildings was common and became associated with wider protests that were not directly linked to university matters . “ Teach-ins ” on matters of political significance , the Vietnam War in particular , were common . Some proposed the end of examinations or the abolition of the distinction between academics and students . In the United States , students demanded , and sometimes established for themselves , new courses on topics such as black studies . At Birmingham in England a “ Free University ” offered courses on , among other things , “ workers ' control , psychedelia and the theory and practice of counter-institutions. ” In London , an “ anti-university ” offered for a time courses by thinkers such as the psychologist R.D . Laing .
The growth of graduate studies fostered radicalism in universities . It created a cadre of students who remained in place for long enough to establish political movements . The Teaching Assistants Association was formed at the University of Wisconsin in 1966 to represent graduate students who earned money teaching , and soon linked the material dissatisfactions of its members to wider questions relating to race and Vietnam . The lives of graduate students were not interrupted by the inconvenient obligation to sit exams . The leisurely pace of life was captured by the jibe in John Irving 's novel The World According to Garp ( published in 1978 and set mainly in the 1960s ) that “ gradual school was where students gradually realize that they do not want to go to school anymore . ”
Graduate study expanded sharply in the 1960s . This was particularly notable in the United States—partly because of the institutionalization of research and partly because attending graduate school became a means to avoid being sent to Vietnam . The idea of graduate education , like most American educational innovations , spread to Britain and Europe . A lawyer at the trial of student activists—largely Americans undertaking postgraduate courses—who had stormed the administrative building at London University remarked briskly that “ doctorates are two a penny in the United States . ”
*
Who were students against ? Sometimes there was a mood of bitter hostility to teachers who were seen as authoritarian or complicit in some wider power structure . Equally professors were sometimes hostile to student activists whom they saw as a threat to the qualities—order , tranquility , reasoned debate—that they regarded as essential to university life . Though students often denounced their enemies as “ fascists , ” their bitterest critics were often Jewish professors—Alexander Gerschenkron , Raymond Aron , Theodor Adorno—who were old enough to have personal memories of Nazism .
However , the struggle in the universities was never a simple conflict of generations and never completely divided teachers from students . Some academics maintained good relations with their students in 68 , or even presented themselves as neutral figures in a struggle between students and “ the university ” —the rise of the professional academic administrator sometimes gave students and teachers a common enemy .
During the occupation of Columbia University in 1968 , students marked their political affiliations with various colored armbands , but members of the faculty wore white bands . Very few professors were either completely for or completely against the student protests , and some took unexpected stands . The historians Rodney Hilton and John Saville , both ex-Communists in their fifties , acted as intermediaries between protesting students and the university authorities at Birmingham and Hull . René Rémond , a senior historian of relatively conservative views at Nanterre , later remarked that he was a soixante-huitard himself in a way because he welcomed the chance to reform his university .
Sometimes there was sympathy between student radicals and professors . The sinologist and historian of science Joseph Needham was master of one of the most conservative colleges in Cambridge but also belonged to Socialists in Higher Education , whose members sought “ a critical destabilization of the system. ” Antonio Negri—born in 1933 and a professor of sociology at Bologna—was a leader of the radical Marxist Lotta Continua . He was later prosecuted for having inspired terrorist acts by the Red Brigades , and the Italian authorities denounced him as the most prominent of the “ bad masters ” —a term that implies that some Italian students listened to their professors too assiduously .
Many academics led double lives that straddled the frontier between academic authority and student rebellion . Jonah Raskin spent some of his nights in 1968 participating in the student occupation of Columbia University but by day he commuted to Stony Brook University to teach his own classes . He was Dr. Raskin to his students , Jonah to his colleagues and “ Jomo ” to readers of his articles in the underground press .
In any case , the expansion of higher education in the post-war period had blurred the boundaries between teachers and students . This was in part because university expansion brought an increase in the proportion of young university teachers . Even among academics of roughly the same age there were some sharp divisions , rooted partly in how fast they had risen up the academic ladder . Barry Supple ( born in 1929 ) was pro-vice chancellor of Sussex University in 1968 and responsible for containing much of the student revolt . Stuart Hall , three years younger than Supple , was in a more junior position and widely regarded as the most important academic to support the British student protests .
“ Very few professors were either completely for or completely against the student protests , and some took unexpected stands . ”
In the United States , the profession was divided into those who did and those who did not enjoy permanent tenure . In France , Germany and Italy , junior academics—often on temporary contracts—were expected to display ostentatious deference to the professors who controlled their careers . The number of these junior academics increased as universities expanded in the 1960s , and the increase was , of course , sharpest in those subjects , such as sociology , that grew fastest . 68 was sometimes as much a rebellion of assistants against professors as it was of students against their teachers .
Those who opposed student protest often presented it as a movement of savage philistinism—one that threatened scholarship itself as well as academic authority . The desacralization of the book was an important part of 68 . Guido Viale , a charismatic figure among leftist students in Turin , remarked that books were “ as bad as professors. ” The belief that university libraries might be threatened by disorder obsessed some academics—David Landes at Harvard said that he would fire on students if they attacked the library .
However , radical students often had a touching attachment to the written word . Members in a Danish commune admitted that books were the one form of private property that they found it hard to renounce . During his years as university dropout , political activist and leader of a London squat , Phil Cohen often found solace in the reading room of the British Museum and he subtitled his memoirs The Radical Bibliophile . Seeking potential recruits to Students for a Democratic Society , George Brosi at Carleton College in Minnesota checked library records because he knew that readers of certain books were likely to have left-wing sympathies . Access to libraries was itself sometimes a demand in 68 . Students at Trento called for an “ American-style library . . . maximum development of the man/book relation—no intermediary—all the books on the wall and within hand reach . ”
Academics sometimes felt an odd sense of renewal in 68 . Didier Anzieu at Nanterre wrote : “ My students sensed that I was preoccupied not so much with them as with the machine . They were bored of my boredom and I was bored of theirs . For the first time that year [ during the uprising of May 1968 ] the University interested me again. ” Even Barry Supple , who defended order at Sussex University , admitted that he derived a frisson of excitement from the drama that he had lived through .
For all the lurid rhetoric , much of what students wanted in 68 could be accommodated by universities . Indeed student protests were often followed by an unexpected burst of consensus . At Nanterre student radicals joined commissions to discuss how teaching might be changed . Even the most dramatic innovations of 68 yielded quite conventional results . Edgar Faure , the wily centrist politician who became minister of education after the May events in France , helped create a new campus at Vincennes—housed in prefabricated buildings and opened in 1969 . The new campus provided an intellectual home for radical thinkers—notably Michel Foucault—and took students who lacked conventional qualifications . As Faure probably anticipated , in the long term even Vincennes calmed down—partly because its relatively old , working-class students sometimes turned out to have rather conventional expectations of education .
Some left universities during or after the protests of 68—to take jobs in factories , become full-time militants or even go underground as urban guerrillas—but a surprisingly large number stayed in , or returned to , education . In 2006 Tom Hayden finally published the masters ' dissertation which he had begun in the early 1960s . Guido Viale , who had called for the destruction of books in 1968 , also became a sociologist . A study of American radical activists from the 1960s found that 30 years later 17 per cent of the sample had become professors .
Dick Flacks—who had himself been a member of Students for a Democratic Society before becoming an academic sociologist who both sympathized with and studied the radicals of the late 1960s—summed things up : “ The Academy was one of the few institutional settings where former student activists could expect a degree of career and economic stability and yet feel relatively uncompromised . ”

Fiery crash in Lehigh Acres the result of reckless driving
A serious crash that sent a family to the hospital is the result of reckless driving , according to the Florida Highway Patrol .
The incident happened around 7 p.m. Friday in the area of Lee Blvd and Curtis Ave .
Juan Alberto Luna , 41 , of Lehigh Acres , was driving a 2015 Ford Mustang along Lee Blvd . Luna 's vehicle collided with the rear of a Toyota SUV , according to the accident report . Luna was travelling at high speeds when the crash occurred .
Upon impact , the SUV caught fire and rolled over onto a surrounding lawn .
Multiple witnesses say Luna was racing other drivers that were not involved in the collision , officials say .
Luna now faces charges of reckless driving .
The SUV was carrying a family . Three adult passengers suffered injuries . There were also four pediatric patients , with the youngest being 5 years old . All were taken to local hospitals for minor injuries .
London : The trial to prove a prima facie case of fraud against fugitive liquor baron Vijay Mallya resumes here on Monday to determine if he can be extradited to India to face charges over his erstwhile Kingfisher Airlines .
The 61-year-old will be back in the dock at Westminster Magistrates ' Court in London for day four of the hearing when his defence led by barrister Clare Montgomery , is set to depose two further witnesses in its attempt to prove that the airline 's alleged default of around Rs 9,000 crore worth of bank loans was the result of business failure rather than `` dishonest '' and `` fraudulent '' activity by its owner .
Meanwhile , it has emerged that the businessman is also facing a parallel litigation in the Queen 's Bench Division of the commercial court in England 's High Court of Justice brought by a consortium of Indian banks to freeze his global assets .
The State Bank of India , Bank of Baroda , Corporation Bank , Federal Bank Ltd , IDBI Bank , Indian Overseas Bank , Jammu & Kashmir Bank , Punjab & Sind Bank , Punjab National Bank , State Bank of Mysore , UCO Bank , United Bank of India and JM Financial Asset Reconstruction Co Pvt Ltd are listed as applicants of that claim against Mallya and related concerns named as Ladywalk LLP , Rose Capital Ventures Ltd and Orange India Holdings .
Lawyers for Mallya have been granted an extension to respond to that case due to his ongoing extradition trial , expected to conclude on Thursday .
Margaret Sweeney , from the accounts team of Force India -- Mallya 's Formula 1 racing team , and legal expert Martin Lau are set to be deposed by his defence team at the extradition hearing today .
Judge Emma Arbuthnot will hear the case over some `` interruptions '' as Uber 's appeal against the cancellation of its operating license in London is expected to open in the same court on Monday .
Last week , the defence claimed that a consortium of Indian banks led by State Bank of India ( SBI ) had rejected an offer by the liquor baron in early 2016 to pay back nearly 80 percent of the principle loan amount owed to them .
While deposing a banking expert last week , Mallya 's counsel Montgomery questioned whether her client 's offer to pay back around Rs 4,400 crores of the principle debt amount on April 6 , 2016 should have been `` dismissed out of hand '' just a day later by the banks .
Paul Rex , who was described as a banker by profession who served as an independent expert in the field for over 20 years , said that banks tend to partially provision for loans unpaid over a long period and such an offer would have helped avoid `` further loss '' .
`` A commercial bank would assess such an offer against other routes of repayment . If that offer is higher than could be expected from other sources , it would be an attractive option for banks to consider , '' he said , adding that state- owned banks in particular tend to be more susceptible to `` political pressure '' .
However , the Crown Prosecution Service ( CPS ) – arguing on behalf of the Indian government – countered that assertion in its cross-examination , indicating that the reason such a repayment offer would have been rejected was that the banks knew Mallya had the means to pay back the entire amount due .
There are plenty of reasons why even a state bank may take a view to reject such an offer , such as if it comes from a `` dishonest '' person who is known to have `` plenty of money to repay '' the entire amount if he wants to , CPS barrister Mark Summers stated during his cross-examination .
He also made a reference to the `` debtor '' ( Mallya ) throwing a birthday party costing around 2 million pounds as a factor which could have influenced the banks ' decision to reject the offer .
The cross-examination of Rex was left incomplete at the end of the third day of the trial last Thursday , to be taken up again tomorrow afternoon .
In his cross-examination , Summers had highlighted a particular `` washing machine activity '' picked up by the government of India that involved sums amounting to around 10 -15 million pounds being funnelled between UB Group companies to wrongly claim obligations of equity infusions into struggling Kingfisher Airlines were being met .
Indian government sources have described its case , being presented by the CPS , as `` very strong '' .
Mallya 's legal team had claimed earlier in the trial that the case against him was `` politically motivated '' and that it was being used as an opportunity to make `` political capital '' by the ruling BJP as well as Congress and Shiv Sena .
The prosecution 's case rests on `` three chapters of dishonesty '' by Mallya – misrepresentations to various banks to acquire loans , the misuse of the loans , and his conduct after the banks recalled the loans .
Mallya , who has been based in the UK since March 2016 , was arrested by Scotland Yard on an extradition warrant in April this year and has been out on bail on a bond worth 650,000 pounds .
If the judge rules in favour of extradition at the end of the trial , the UK home secretary must order Mallya 's extradition within two months . However , the case can go through a series of appeals in higher UK courts before arriving at a conclusion .
Electric car sales around the world rose by 54 percent in 2017 , taking global stock across the three-million threshold , the International Energy Agency ( IEA ) said in a report yesterday . In China , the world 's biggest market for electric vehicles , sales also grew by about half - but their market share remained small at 2.2 percent . In Norway electric vehicles have by far the world 's highest market share , but even there it is still only 6.4 percent , according to the IEA . Nonetheless , the Paris-based agency was optimistic about the sector 's prospects .
`` Supportive policies and cost reductions are likely to lead to significant growth in the market uptake of ( electric vehicles ) in the outlook period to 2030 , '' the report said . Should policy-makers honor their current commitments to the environment , `` the number of electric light-duty vehicles on the road ( would reach ) 125 million by 2030 , '' it added .
And should policy ambitions develop further , that number could become as high as 220 million in 2030 , it said . But the IEA said that in order for the cars of the future to overtake their petrol and diesel-powered competitors , governments will have to take the lead .
`` The main markets by volume ( China ) and sales share ( Norway ) have the strongest policy push , '' the IEA said .
`` Looking ahead , the strongest current policy signals emanate from electric car mandates in China and California , as well as the European Union 's recent proposal on carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) emissions standards for 2030 . ''
The EU has committed to cutting 40 percent of its greenhouse gas emissions from 1990 levels , and to boosting its use of renewable energy by at least 27 percent . France , home to Europe 's second-biggest car industry after Germany , has gone further by announcing a plan to end sales of petrol and diesel vehicles by 2040 , as part of an ambitious plan to meet its targets under the Paris climate accord . Electric vehicles use batteries instead of petrol or diesel , thereby massively reducing their damage to the environment . But they are not without controversy . Key components in the batteries include the mineral cobalt , much of which comes from the unrest-hit Democratic Republic of Congo . Rights groups have raised concerns about corruption in the cobalt industry and often poor working conditions for the miners in DR Congo .
Lamborghini Urus – a Brutal Display of Power and Style
Ladies and gentlemen , Lamborghini has officially entered the SUV market with the ravishing Urus , which is basically a supercar in SUV guise , ready to take down any opponents in its segment .
Packing a 4.0-liter twin turbo V8 , that 's capable of developing 641 hp and 850 Nm of torque , the all new Lamborghini Urus will do 0 to 62 mph ( 100 km/h ) in just 3.6 seconds , 0 to 124 mph ( 200 km/h ) in 12.8 seconds , and it will reach a breathtaking top speed of 190 mph ( 305 km/h ) . Some of you will be glad to know that a plug-in hybrid option is also on the way .
Right now an electro-hydraulically controlled 8-speed automatic transmission handles all that power , while a torque converter goes on to boost the twin-turbo V8 's response – the power is sent to the front or rear axle , depending on necessities .
The Lamborghini Urus borrowed the Aventador S ' rear-wheel steering system , whici is a pretty interesting feature for a 4×4 . Set to utilize counter-phase steering at low speed and in-phase steering and high speed , this SUV will most likely leave any competitor in its dust , especially on the curves .
A performance-oriented center of gravity was achieved thanks to the low mounting place of the engine , while the central turbocharger was fitted near the combustion chambers to enhance engine response .
The Urus boasts six drive modes : Strada , Sport , Corsa , Neve ( specially designed for snow ) , Terra ( an off-road mode ) and Sabbia ( for sand ) , plus a custom mode called Ego . According to the driver 's choices , the SUV will be raised in order to improve ground clearance or it will be lowered to benefit from optimized performance .
Design-wise , this SUV is absolutely incredible from front to back , showing off supercar proportions and diagonal hood lines , massive air intakes , as well as sleek front lights , standing horizontally and featuring LED DRLs .
Familiar , yet unique , the cabin aims to be luxurious , but it 's also inspired from fast cars and racing pedigree . Hexagonal elements within the dashboard , a three-spoke steering wheel with vibration damping and a fully digital TFT display can be easily noticed , while the High Beam Assistant , parking sensors , a PreCognition system , plus driver and front passenger 12-way electric heated seats are a few welcomed additions .
The Lamborghini Urus benefits from plenty of storage space as well , and starts off at $ 200,000 in the US ( £131,500 UK / €171,429 Europe / RMB 3,130,000 China .
After the New York Times report detailing sexual harassment claims against Harvey Weinstein broke on Thursday , many who worked with the mogul asked why it took so long for the allegations to become public .
It 's a question that always gets asked when news about harassment and abuse of women going back decades surfaces . Former Fox News anchor Gretchen Carlson 's sexual harassment suit against Roger Ailes and the women who came forward to accuse comedian Bill Cosby of sexual assault are getting some of the credit for paving the way for Weinstein 's accusers to finally come forward .
But it remains to be seen whether the latest allegations against another powerful media and entertainment industry figure will turn the issue of sexual harassment and the treatment of women into an industrywide issue that needs to be addressed more forcefully .
Debra Katz , an attorney specializing in sexual harassment cases , said the industry 's willingness to forgive the indiscretions of powerful , talented men can keep the issue from getting traction .
“ It 's significant that Ashley Judd spoke and perhaps it will encourage other women to describe their own experiences , ” Katz said , citing one of Weinstein 's accusers . “ We all know this goes on . I do n't think it 's going to go away because we 're shining a light on Harvey Weinstein .... It 's about abuse of power . It 's about having enablers around them . I 'm not optimistic that anything is going to change anytime soon . ”
Still , the mounting accusations against Cosby and the lawsuit by Carlson against her boss at the network she worked at for 10 years were a one-two punch in bringing sexual harassment out of the shadows .
`` Gretchen Carlson was the igniter of a tinderbox that had embers swirling around it for decades , '' said Lauren Zalaznick , a veteran media executive who publishes the online feminist newsletter LZ Papers .
In July 2016 , Carlson filed her lawsuit against Ailes , the impresario and founding chief executive of Fox News , accusing him of sexual harassment and retaliation .
While Fox News denied Carlson 's allegations , the former Miss America was not subjected to the type of personal smears that other sexual harassment accusers have been subjected to in the past . Within a month of her suit , Ailes was ousted from Fox News , which eventually paid Carlson a $ 20-million settlement .
“ Before Cosby and Gretchen , it was unfashionable to come forward , ” said one veteran TV news producer who has worked with Carlson and spoke on the condition of anonymity . “ Everybody would go to the men 's side . What was groundbreaking about her is she was someone who was n't assassinated and was vindicated . ”
Cosby has not been convicted of any crime , but the allegations against him by nearly 50 women have virtually ended his career and resulted in his enormously popular sitcom “ The Cosby Show ” being dropped by most of the TV outlets that carried it in reruns . Cosby has denied wrongdoing . The high-profile case accusing him of aggravated indecent assault ended in a mistrial in June after the jury deadlocked . Prosecutors plan to try him again .
But how Hollywood reacts to the Weinstein allegations will be the next test of whether the industry is serious about addressing sexual harassment , Zalaznick said .
`` The question is who actually wants to change versus who knows that lip service is the price you have to appear to pay , before we all move on to another hot-button issue du jour , ” Zalaznick said .
In a statement on the Weinstein report , Carlson noted that it is nondisclosure agreements that allow workplace harassment to go on unreported .
“ Once again , we have the revelation that for 30 years a powerful man has harassed women and the companies they run have enabled it , covered it up , and shut up the victims , ” Carlson said . “ This happens in all industries and it must stop . Equally disturbing is the fact that the Weinstein Co. required employees to agree to secrecy before they were even hired . Then , the women who were brave enough to complain about harassment were forced to sign confidentiality agreements . This is typical . These secrecy and arbitration agreements allow the harassers to harass again , sometimes for decades , and the women are forever silenced . When will this dynamic end ? ”

A new CIA intelligence assessment concludes North Korea has no plans to relinquish its nuclear weapons program even though denuclearization is the centerpiece of the summit tentatively planned for next month , NBC News reported Tuesday .
But North Korean leader Kim Jong-un may be willing to bring a U.S. burger outlet to Pyongyang as a show of good faith , the assessment suggests .
NBC said it spoke with three U.S. officials who read the assessment , circulated this month . The CIA declined to comment on the report .
The assessment says a more realistic , immediate objective would be persuading Kim to curtail his country 's nuclear weapons program , the officials told NBC News .
Harry Kazianis , director of defense studies at the conservative , Washington-based think-tank Center for the National Interest , said the on-again , off-again , on-again nature of the summit is likely the result of Pyongyang 's refusal to provide `` concrete assurances '' on denuclearization .
“ The fundamental reality is this : North Korea has spent billions of dollars and likely starved countless citizens to build nuclear weapons and long-range missiles that can strike the U.S. '' Kazianis told USA TODAY . `` There is likely almost nothing we can give Kim Jong-un that will replace what is the ultimate insurance policy that Washington does not someday invade his country or attack his atomic arsenal . ''

However , South Korean leader Moon Jae-in , after meeting with the Korean leader last month , said Kim made a firm commitment to drop his nuclear weapons program .
A summit between President Trump and Kim was tentatively planned for June 12 in Singapore . Trump accused Kim of showing `` open hostility '' toward Washington as public discourse between the two nations devolved into a torrent of angry rhetoric and threats .
Discussions continued , however , and on Sunday , Trump announced U.S. officials were in North Korea making arrangements for the meeting . On Tuesday , Trump said Kim Young Chol , a former spy chief , was playing a major role in the summit .
Meanwhile , Moon and Kim have agreed to work on a plan to formally end the Korean War that was halted by a temporary armistice in 1953 . Kim has told Moon that a formal end to the hostilities , along with a pledge from the U.S. not to attack his nation , would eliminate Pyongyang 's desire to build a nuclear arsenal .
Facebook has reportedly banned a page that claimed to have sabotaged a Hollywood movie 's ratings and is preparing to damage the score of other upcoming films on an American review website , media reports said .
The group `` Down With Disney 's Treatment of Franchises and its Fanboys '' -- which claimed the responsibility of the low score for fantasy film `` Star Wars : The Last Jedi '' -- created an event to hurt the ratings of Disney 's upcoming film `` Black Panther '' on Rotten Tomatoes , Marvel Studio News reported late on Friday .
According to The Verge , the group also created an event to leave low ratings and negative reviews for another film `` Solo : A Star Wars Story '' and indicated they would set up additional events for `` Avengers : Infinity War '' and the company 's Marvel Netflix shows .
The group described itself as a pro-DC Expanded Universe -- the largest competitor of Marvel Cinematic Universe -- and claimed that the poor reviews for Warner Bros ' DC films were due to Disney manipulating the press .
The users on the platform reportedly complained that the group was using bots to further lower the Marvel projects ' ratings and directed other like-minded fans to the page to post negative reviews .
Meanwhile , Rotten Tomatoes said that they were proud to have become a platform for passionate fans to debate and discuss entertainment and they take that responsibility seriously .
`` While we respect our fans ' diverse opinions , we do not condone hate speech .
`` Our team of security , network and social experts continue to closely monitor our platforms . Any users who engage in such activities will be blocked from our site and their comments removed as quickly as possible , '' Marvel Studio News quoted the website as saying .
Sports Minister , Justina Charles , has reported that about $ 6-million is needed to repair the Windsor Park Sports Stadium due to damages caused by Hurricane Maria .
At a press conference on Monday morning , Charles described the stadium as Dominica 's “ greatest accomplishment ” in sports .
“ Thanks to the People 's Republic of China for giving us this wonderful gift and we know it was severely affected and we know the effect of the stadium being affected on our economy and sports by extension , ” she stated .
The Minister said most of the facility 's roof and the perimeter walls were affected . She noted that two towers fell and the electrical cabinet that controls the towers were damaged .
Additionally , a $ 3-million scoreboard which was recently installed was damaged .
“ And so we now have to look to see how we can repair some of those things , ” Charles noted .
At this time , she said , an assessment has been done on the damages .
“ I must say we have received an assessment of the extent of damage and the cost to repair it and you wo n't believe it is in excess of $ 6-million to restore everything at the stadium , the VIP booths , the towers , our perimeter fence and everything that was affected by the storm to do it in a more climate resilient manner , ” Charles said . “ So we definitely have to look at our way forward in terms of the stadium . ”
She vowed to have the roof repaired by the first quarter of 2018 .
The Windsor Park Sports Stadium was officially open on October 24 , 2007 , and the $ 33-million facility was viewed as a gift from the People 's Republic of China .

I was proud and excited about the recent announcement that my hometown Los Angeles will be hosting the 2028 Summer Olympic Games . Los Angeles joins Paris and London as the only cities to have hosted an Olympics three times , though Los Angeles will set a milestone as the first city to host twice in the modern era . Los Angeles aspires to share another critical designation with Paris and London – joining the upper echelon of elite global cities .
Los Angeles 's thriving commercial real estate market is leading to robust growth in infrastructure and office space , boosted by an infusion of tech , entertainment and other growing businesses . A decade of preparation for the 2028 Olympics , and the economic influx and added post-event revenue that this will likely bring , should catapult Los Angeles into a higher ranking of dominant world cities .
A world city ( also called a global city or a world center ) is a critical nerve center of business , innovation , economic output and cultural capital . World cities propel global finance , political stability , quality of life for its citizens and information exchange . Some of the key metrics used to quantify global influence , as in AT Kearney 's annual global cities report , include infusion of trade , international business , innovation and multiple major industries ( including the presence of industry leaders ) , network centers and strategic regional hubs , as well as intrinsic value to the global community at large .
Higher ranking global cities often dictate where businesses choose to build major hubs and headquarters . A rise in world city rankings resonates for decades across multiple sectors and heavily impacts many industries and human migration patterns to meet job force and economic demands . All of the above is a net positive for commercial real estate : the higher a ranking a world city attains , the more value and forward potential its real estate market commands .
One of the most immediate impacts of hosting the Olympics is an infusion of money from tourism , broadcast rights , licensing , inward investment , sales and oversees contracts . Revenues from the 2012 London Olympics are estimated to be between £9-10 billion pounds . Similarly , Rio de Janeiro enjoyed $ 9+ billion in revenues from hosting the 2016 Olympics , somewhat tempered by the fact that they ran over budget . A National Bureau of Economic Research report also demonstrates a sizable and lasting Olympic impact on trade , most notably national exports ( 30 percent higher for countries that have hosted the Olympics ) , but also clustered regionally and locally for host cities .
In the immediate future , preparation to host the Olympics will proliferate and hasten the influx of funding for commercial real estate and infrastructure , creating a boomerang effect on job creation . Accessibility of different neighborhoods will be aided by an aggressive 40-year plan to upgrade Los Angeles transit , including metro rail , buses , downtown streetcars and highways . Indeed , the Olympics may function as an important catalyst to expand commuting radius and set firm deadlines for construction and completion of projects .
Hospitality , retail and restaurant sectors will need to expand to meet the increase in tourism . Finally , an upgrade of existing sports venues and construction of new facilities will be necessary .
The broader , more subtle effect will be a continued climb up the pecking order as a global city of enormous and diverse influence . Long-term , Los Angeles will likely burgeon economically , with an influx of migration , innovative human capital and cross-disciplinary talent . As a premier port city and business engine , this will then attract industries , influential headquarters , foreign capital and international investment . The resulting high-paying , high-quality jobs , tourism and corporate travel will all have the cumulative effect of driving appreciation of commercial real estate ( office space , luxury retail , hospitality , multifamily housing and work/live urban neighborhood revitalization ) .
According to the Global Power City Index , Los Angeles is on the outside cusp of the top 10 world cities based on current criteria metrics , something that will surely change in the decades to come . But there are already three intangible global currency categories that we are very competitive in : propagating culture as the undisputed entertainment capital of the world , being the top-ranked U.S. city for international real estate investment , and now the total number of Olympics hosted !
Los Angeles is already well on its way to becoming a sophisticated , influential , dominant global power .
The “ Silicon Beach ” tech industry has boomed in a few short years , as both an incubator hub for new talent and an overflow destination for companies from the Bay Area . The city has a permanent grip as the epicenter of media , entertainment and PR . It also boasts a rapidly emerging biotech industry and significant foreign business capital investment .
The announcement of the 2028 Olympic Games in Los Angeles is yet another signal of its arrival as a bona fide world city . Higher commercial real estate valuation and more development are bound to follow .

“ I think he was like a David Suzuki on a paddle board . That was his passion , ” friend Paul Mend said .
“ He shared love , you know ? When you met Bob , you just became a friend , and it was lifelong , ” he said .
Above all else , Purdy is remembered as a gentle , loving soul — full of colour who brightened the lives of those around him .
“ We 're sporting the pink tutus today — that was kind of Bob 's trademark . He would show up at races and have his pink tutu on , and he was just that kind of guy , ” Mend said .
Paddle boarders planned a waterman 's sendoff for Purdy at several locations , including Victoria , Tofino , Deep Cove and Kelowna .
Paddlers on the water gathered in a circle and raised their paddles in the air .
According to a Facebook post , the goal was “ to carry on with his legacy of bringing people together to change the way we live on the planet . ”

The ban will apply for island bars restaurants hotels , bars , gas stations , and visiting tourists . The fines range from $ 100 to $ 500 per straw .
The plan would allow for compostable straws , a more environmentally friendly option that completely breaks down , said Joanna Shamp , a Fort Myers Beach city council member .
“ This will be a start in really attending to all the issues that relate to plastic contamination and micro plastic contamination within the Gulf of Mexico , and its impacts on not only marine life but human life as well , ” Shamp said .

Paralympic swimmer Sophie Pascoe increased her number of world records broken in Auckland this week to a mind-blowing 6 , as the 24-year-old Kiwi made more history on night 4 of the New Zealand Short Course Championships . Competing in the 100m butterfly tonight , Pascoe cracked a new S10 World Record with her time of 1:03.13 .
“ It 's been a pleasure to be back home to race and be a part of a great week , ” Pascoe said post-race .
Mary Fisher followed Pascoe 's lead with a new Para Swimming World Record of her own . Stopping the clock at 1:16.77 , Fisher earned a new S11 World Record , hacking just under 4 seconds off of her own personal best in the process .
On top of the multiple age group records that fell yesterday , courtesy of Gabrielle Fa'amausili , Ciara Smith and others , Erika Fairweather established a new 13 years record in the 800m freestyle . Touching in 8:58.05 , Fairweather easily won her age group 's national title by almost 30 seconds .
Fairweather had already set new 13 years age group records in the 400m IM ( 4:55.18 ) , 400 free ( 4:22.52 ) and 200m free ( 2:03.57 ) thus far this week in Auckland .
National record holder Daniel Hunter has been suffering from illness this week , but was able to contribute to his Howick Pakuranga club 's 4x50m freestyle victory tonight . His squad earned a winning time of 1:30.37 in the men 's race .
The meet concludes tomorrow with two more sessions .
Pulling drinkable water out of dry air
Imagine a future in which every home has an appliance that pulls all the water the household needs out of the air , even in dry or desert climates , using only the power of the sun .
Earlier this week , the Washington Capitals finished off the Columbus Blue Jackets in Game 6 , setting up a second-round series with a familiar foe . The Pittsburgh Penguins await in Round 2 , having dispatched the Philadelphia Flyers , also in Game 6 .
This sets up a series hockey fans are pretty acclimated to by now . For the third consecutive year , it 'll be the Pens versus the Caps in a playoff series . Both teams deserve to be there — no one gets to and then through the NHL playoffs because of sheer luck — but we ca n't help but wonder whether or not another round of Sidney Crosby versus Alex Ovechkin is actually good for the sport itself .
Will it be fun ? Probably , but that does n't mean this semifinal does n't have a handful of pros and cons in play .
Pro : Crosby vs Ovechkin Is an Easy Sell to Casual Fans
Let 's face it : casual NHL fans are n't plugged in from the first day of training camp all the way through to the Stanley Cup Final , especially if their team is n't involved . The playoffs bring the sport 's more cursory supporters out of the woodwork , which means that broadcast partners need a quick and punchy way to get them to tune into broadcasts once every 48 hours or so ( give or take ) .
It does n't get much more quick and punchy than Ovechkin vs Crosby . They 've been sharing headlines and arenas since they were teenagers — well , “ The Great Eight ” technically debuted as a 20-year-old , but you get the point .
Capitals knock out the Blue Jackets . Sets up Washington vs. Pittsburgh . Ovechkin vs. Crosby again . pic.twitter.com/dr24EVp1Yd — Brad Galli ( @ BradGalli ) April 24 , 2018
The game has plenty of rising stars , but No . 8 and No . 87 are the two players who saw us out of the darkness of the 2005 lockout and reminded us of why we love hockey in the first place . Both men know how to put on a show , and whenever they square off , it leads to emotional and skill-driven play .
What 's not to like ?
Con : It 's Not Just Crosby vs Ovechkin Anymore
Oh , right . The idea that this is just Crosby against Ovechkin is both antiquated and obnoxious . It 's what the talking heads on NBCSN will ram down our throats during each and every intermission and in advertisements , but if the Penguins and Capitals were driven by just Crosby and Ovechkin , then they would n't be in the second round .
Washington and Pittsburgh both roster some of the most exciting or interesting players in the league – from Phil Kessel and Matt Murray to John Carlson and Braden Holtby , both squads are chock full of quality skaters . We probably should n't leave out Evgeni Malkin and the perpetually underappreciated Nicklas Backstrom , either .
Despite all this talent , all anyone is going to want to talk about is the two captains , which is a bummer because these are two outstanding teams with more to offer than Crosby and Ovechkin .
Pro : Penguins & Capitals Have a Baked-In Rivalry
The NHL loves trying to make us believe that the two teams skating against each other on our televisions are rivals . We 're more than four years into the whole Wednesday Night Rivalry schtick , but most of the time , the thought of the two squads involved actually disliking each other is worth an eye roll at best .
Pittsburgh versus the Anaheim Ducks sold as a rivalry game ? C'mon .
Related : Penguins Prove They Are n't Tired Of Winning Yet
The league does n't have to worry about putting the Penguins and Capitals over as a potentially heated encounter , though , because there 's plenty of recent history in place . It 's the third consecutive time these two teams will meet in the playoffs and we have the wonderful story of the generation 's most electric goal scorer trying to finally get to the Eastern Conference Final for the first time in his otherwise illustrious career .
To get there , he 'll have to take down Crosby ; a player who has gotten the better of him at every turn since they entered the league together 13 years ago . Who does n't want to see that , even if it 's the third consecutive season in which it has happened ?
Con : Is it Special if it Happens Every Year ?
Let 's say your favorite meal on the face of the planet is filet mignon ; maybe with a side of roasted duck potatoes and a pleasant pinot noir from Tuscany to wash it all down with .
It 's the meal you get on your birthday . Maybe the occasional night out on the town when you 're celebrating a wayward friend coming home or a hard-earned promotion .
Over the next 10 years , you know it 's something you 'll maybe be able to eat 11 or 12 times total . That 's part of what makes ordering the meal special , right ? The food itself is n't particularly scarce , but the experience is . You know things have to line up just right for that filet mignon to land on your plate , so you savor each and every bite when it 's in front of you .
Would n't it become less memorable if you were able to consume it , say , once a week ? Suddenly it 's a part of your routine and not this extraordinary thing you get to look forward to at only the most special times in your life .
That 's the intriguing question that will linger over this series as it unfolds . How many tricks do Ovechkin and Crosby have left up their sleeves ? How many turns can we take before we 've seen it all before ? Is it a party if it happens every night ?
Pro : They Represent the Best of this Generation
Maybe you 're sick of the Penguins and Capitals and you were angered by the emergence of this trilogy . Plenty of folks on Twitter seemed to fall into this camp as Washington shook hands with the Blue Jackets on Monday night . Maybe you 're on the other side and you are as amped for it as Alex Ovechkin himself claims to be .
The fact remains that Crosby is 30 . Ovechkin is 32 . We 're only going to get a few more opportunities to watch these two titans clash on the grandest of stages . They 're both locked in the Eastern Conference , so we 'll probably never get a Stanley Cup Final between the two . This is the closest we 'll get to see that unfold .
Is it repetitive for those who live and breathe the game ? Perhaps on paper , but if you love hockey then why would n't you want to see the best two players of this generation square off as often as possible ? The postseason is n't rigged — both Pittsburgh and Washington deserve to be where they are .
All we can do now is sit back , enjoy the ride and appreciate it while it lasts . Who knows if this will be the final time we see Crosby face Ovechkin in the playoffs ? Then , 10 years from now , with the benefit of hindsight , we 'll talk about that classic trio of series and how it brought the best out of the transcendent players of our time .
In our previous article Hot Rod Dynamics was putting the final touches on Jeff Hagaman 's 2011 Cadillac CTS-V monster . The factory 6.2 L V8 was tossed for a Tim Lynch built 427 ci ( 7.0 L ) LSx V8 which produces around 1,500+ horsepower to the wheels thanks to two large turbochargers . The team 's effort has already paid off . Jeff set a world record the first time out with the CTS-V by going 190.35 mph in the half-mile . And you can expect that number to climb after a little more practice .

Florida troopers and other state law enforcement officers will get a pay raise under a new law signed Wednesday by Governor Rick Scott . The five percent hike will add up to an extra $ 11.7 million dollars for state agencies , including the Florida Department of Law Enforcement and the Florida Highway Patrol .
Governor Scott lauded both groups for their response in the past year to the Pulse nightclub shooting and Hurricane Matthew .
State sworn officers received their last pay hike in 2013 . In central Florida , base salaries for troopers are higher to compete with the Orlando Police Department . The current base salary is $ 38,500 .
Pay raises for state sworn law enforcement officers can only be mandated by the state legislature .
The raise is expected to kick in on July 1st .
Mohamed Salah could still play a role for Egypt at the World Cup after the Egyptian Football Association announced Wednesday that the injured Liverpool striker would be out for `` not more '' than three weeks .
`` The football federation reiterates that Salah will be at the World Cup , God willing , and will be out for no longer than three weeks , '' the federation said after its president Hani Abu Reda and the team doctor met with Salah in Spain , where he is undergoing treatment .
A full three-week absence would likely keep Salah out of action until at least June 17 , meaning he would miss Egypt 's opening fixture in Group A against Uruguay on June 15 . They then face Russia on June 19 and Saudi Arabia on June 25 .
Salah arrived for rehabilitation in Valencia on Sunday , the day after he injured his shoulder after being wrestled to the ground by Sergio Ramos in the Champions League final Real Madrid won 3-1 .
The Egyptian FA announced on Monday that their star player , who hit a stunning 44 goals for Liverpool last season in all competitions , had started rehabilitation immediately on Sunday in the hope of playing a role in Egypt 's first appearance in the World Cup since 1990 .
The forward - Liverpool 's top scorer last season with 44 goals - was forced off Saturday 's match against Real Madrid after a tangle with defender Sergio Ramos .
The Liverpool forward was injured in the first half of the Champions League final against Real Madrid and left the field in tears . Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp said after the game that Salah 's World Cup campaign was in jeopardy but the EFA gave an optimistic update on Wednesday after its president Hani Abu Reda , national team coach Hector Cuper and doctor Mohamed Abou El-Ela met with the forward in Valencia .
The day after Salah was injured , he tweeted : `` It was a very tough night , but I 'm a fighter . Despite the odds , I 'm confident that I 'll be in Russia to make you all proud .
`` Your love and support will give me the strength I need . ''
Egyptians have pinned their hopes on Salah at the World Cup . The forward scored twice in a win over Congo that qualified Egypt for their third finals - and their first since 1990 .
Following Salah 's injury Egyptians reacted on social media , with some claiming that there was a conspiracy against him and others insulting Ramos .

Dear Dr. Roach : About seven years ago , my niece was pregnant with twins and developed chest pains and could not breathe well . She was rushed to the emergency room and found out she had blood clots in her lungs . A blood test showed she had factor V Leiden . She was in the hospital for a long time , and everything turned out fine . I believe she was put on a blood thinner and is still on it .
My sisters and brothers all got tested , and we all had the mutation , except for one sister . We were told it was inherited from one or both of our parents . My blood test said I had one copy of the factor V Leiden mutation , and the doctor said to take one low-dose aspirin a day . I believe my sister takes a blood thinner , but we boys take low-dose aspirin .
Are we taking the right medication for this disorder ? Could our relatives possibly have inherited this disorder ?
I served in the U.S. Navy and asked why I was never tested for this disorder . They told me they only test you if there is a problem . I 'm 68 now .
G.Z .
Dear G.Z . : Factor V Leiden is an abnormal form of a protein in the process of coagulating the blood . It is a common mutation , and people with this particular mutation are at higher risk for developing abnormal blood clots . However , most people with the mutation will not develop a blood clot , and so the risks of an anticoagulant are generally considered outweighing the possible benefits .
I agree with most authorities that people with one copy of the mutation , such as the one you inherited from your father , should not be treated with a “ blood thinner , ” i.e. , an anticoagulant , such as warfarin or one of the newer agents . Even people with two abnormal copies of the gene usually do not receive medication unless they have a history of a blood clot .
Based on your age , it may be appropriate for you to be on aspirin , from the standpoint of your heart , regardless of the factor V Leiden .
However , even with the aspirin , you should be aware that you have a somewhat higher level of risk , and I would recommend that you be very cautious in situations where blood clots are more likely to occur . For example , I would recommend that if you were to take a long plane trip , you should be assiduous about periodically getting up and walking around . Further , you should let your doctor and surgeon know about this condition before any planned surgery , as it might be appropriate to use preventive medications , depending on the type of surgery .
Dear Dr. Roach : I 'm considering getting the shingles shot . I 'm hesitating because I have lichen planus . Should I get the vaccine ?
R.M .
Dear R.M . : Many conditions , including lichen planus , are thought to have a disordered , overactive immune system as part of their cause . Getting live vaccines like shingles is cautionary for those with serious damage to the immune system . I 'd recommend getting the vaccine .

Kiss frontman Gene Simmons is awaiting the signal from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office after he filed an application Friday for a trademark on a hand gesture . Rock fans are probably familiar with the sight . Here 's the drawing that 's included in the application :
According to Simmons , this hand gesture was first used in commerce Nov. 14 , 1974 . That appears to correspond with Kiss ' Hotter Than Hell tour .
Speaking of hell , the hand gesture appears quite similar to what 's known as the “ Sign of the horns , ” a devil signal that , according to an entertaining entry from Wikipedia , dates back to the 5th Century BC founder of Buddhism .
Simmons is claiming the hand gesture mark for “ entertainment , namely , live performances by a musical artist ; personal appearances by a musical artist . ”
Before the Trademark Office allows this hand gesture to be registered — it perhaps would n't be unprecedented — an examiner would consider the likelihood of confusion and , possibly , whether it 's too generic to be associated with Simmons . Here , for example , is a Beatles promotional image taken in 1967 , which was later used for a reissue of the “ Yellow Submarine ” b/w “ Eleanor Rigby ” single :
On the road to registration , Simmons might have other obstacles besides John Lennon . Among them could be how in certain Mediterranean cultures , the horns — or “ rock on ” — gesture is , in the words of The New York Post , “ made to a man to imply that his wife is cheating on him. ” Whether or not that matters is possibly impacted by the U.S. Supreme Court 's upcoming ruling in Tam v. Lee .
An even bigger question is the extent to which Simmons could enforce trademark rights even if his registration is accepted .
Former professional wrestler Diamond Dallas Page has tried . Some reported that he had sued Jay-Z over the “ Roc-A-Fella Hand Gesture , ” alleging it was a trademark infringement of his “ Diamond Cutter hand gesture , ” although we could n't locate any complaint . However , we did find a lawsuit filed by Page in 2010 against the American electronic music duo , 3OH13 . Here was the complaint filed in court . According to records from the Trademark Office , the case settled .
No matter what happens for Simmons , we guarantee nobody will ever be able to trademark a handshake .

The number of cases pending with the Supreme Court has recorded a whopping increase of almost 100 % during the last eight years . The number of pending cases has reached 36,344 as compared to 18,359 in 2009 , according to a summary statement of the Supreme Court issued . This rapid increase in the number of pending cases is the biggest challenge faced by the SC judges , who are already tolerating criticism in dealing with matters that are political in nature . According to the summary statement , as many as 25,604 pending cases in the apex court came from the high courts , wherein 16,117 were civil petitions and 9,487 civil appeals . Likewise , 294 constitutional petitions , which have been directly filed in the apex court , are pending so far , it states , adding that decisions on 177 human rights cases and 59 suomotu matters are still awaited . Only one reference , which was filed by former president Asif Ali Zardari for revisiting of judgment in Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto murder case , is pending while decisions on 1,269 criminal appeals are still awaited , according to the statement .

There 's nothing quite like feeling as though you got more than what you paid for . That 's how you 'll feel if you drop a C-note on JBL 's Flip 4 Bluetooth speaker . Small , easy tote , and waterproof to the point of being submersible , this speaker sounds like it 's considerably bigger and much more expensive .
It can easily fill a large bedroom with sound , and it can also hold its own outside . But the Flip 4 is more than just loud . It delivers a quality of sound that you would n't expect for its size or price tag , despite being outfitted with just two 40mm full-range drivers and an 8-watt-per-channel amplifier .
A pair of 1.5-inch passive radiators on each end certainly help by serving up copious amounts of bass response , but never out of proportion to the mid-range and higher frequencies . I found that the Flip 4 delivered terrific dynamic range with all types of music , from acoustic jazz to hard rock .
The cylindrical speaker measures 6.9 inches wide and 2.7 inches in diameter and has thick rubber end caps at each end , with a 1.5-inch strip of rubber running across its back . Lay it horizontally , and the speaker almost automatically rolls into a position where that strip holds the drivers pointed slightly up and toward your ears . I thought the speaker sounded best oriented that way , but if it takes up too much space , you can stand it on end . Those sloped end caps will also angle the speaker up .
JBL The JBL Flip 4 is available in a range of colors .
The speaker 's power button and a JBL Connect+ button ( more on that in a bit ) are located on that rubber strip , along with a 5-element LED to indicate current the battery level . A thick rubber plug protects water and dirt from getting into the 1/8-inch headphone jack and USB charging port . Raised rubber buttons for volume up/down , play/pause , and Bluetooth pairing are to the left side of the strip , where your fingertips can easily find them . No buttons are provided for moving up and down your playlist .
The Flip 4 's shape and size makes it easy to pick up and carry around , and there 's a convenient lanyard should you want to hang the speaker on a hook , tree branch , or your backpack ( although it will be vertically oriented in those scenarios ) . An open-weave cloth grill covers the rest of the speaker , but JBL nonetheless rates the speakers weatherproofing as IPX7 . That means there is no stated protection from dust ingress , but that the speaker can be submerged in up three feet of water for up to 30 minutes without suffering damage .
JBL The JBL Connect app is of limited usefulness , but it can tell you which firmware version is installed on the speaker .
The Flip 4 has a built-in microphone , so you can use it as a speakerphone . The mic can also be used to summon Google Assistant from an Android phone or Siri from an iPhone . JBL says the Flip 4 's 3000mAh battery should deliver 12 hours of music after a 3.5-hour charge , a claim I did n't verify . JBL provides a three-foot ribbon cable for this purpose , but you 'll need to provide your own AC adapter .
JBL offers an app—JBL Connect , available for Android and iOS—but you wo n't really need it unless you intend to take advantage of some of the Flip 4 's special features .
The app lets you reconfigure the Flip 4 's play/pause button to instead summon your phone 's digital assistant , for instance . If you have two identical JBL Bluetooth speakers , you can configure one as the left channel and the other as the right . Finally , the JBL Connect+ button I mentioned earlier puts the speaker into party mode : Now you can connect as many as 100 other JBL Bluetooth speakers and stream music to all of them from the same device .
I thoroughly enjoyed listening to the Flip 4 . It 's a great value for the money .

Calling herself “ the luckiest person in athletics , ” Jill Stobber has been a successful high school and college athlete , a coach , a trainer and an athletic director .
Make that an award-winning athletic director .
At the recent Wisconsin Athletic Directors Association spring caucus in Fort Atkinson , Stobber , the Waterford Union High School athletic and activities director , was tabbed as the District 6 Athletic Director of the Year . She will be honored at the annual WADA conference in November .
“ Absolutely I was surprised by it , ” Stobber said . “ Obviously it 's very humbling to be nominated and voted by your peers . Everybody does pretty much the same job across the state , so it 's definitely humbling . ”
The award nomination also confirms that the Burlington High School graduate and Athletic Wall of Famer made the right decision to rejoin the Wolverines .
After working at Waterford as a teacher , coach and athletic trainer for 11 years , she left in 2009 to become the athletic director and assistant principal at Whitnall High School . Following a two-year stay , she moved on to Hartford Union High School for a four-year stint as the athletic director .
That 's when she had the opportunity to return to Waterford prior to the 2015-16 school year .
“ Great community and a great staff to work with , ” she said about Waterford . “ Obviously good kids have come through the district . You can do the job anywhere , but it 's the community and the people that you work with that make a big difference . ”
A popular softball coach during her first stint at Waterford , she acknowledged that she still misses being on the sidelines and coaching .
“ Probably a little bit more than I thought I was going to , ” she said with a laugh . “ I definitely know it 's in my blood . I thought I was ready to hang up the coaching hat , but it 's still kind of there . In different games , I feel it sneaking out a little bit . That would probably be something that once I retire I would n't mind going back and doing . ”
Like all athletic directors , Stobber has quickly found the biggest challenge to be multi-tasking . On some days , a circus background as a juggler would come in handy .
That is especially true in the spring when events are constantly being cancelled and rescheduled due to inclement weather .
“ I want to make sure that I 'm constantly supporting my coaches , ” she said . “ Trying to get to all the events is probably the most difficult aspect of the job . You want to support everyone as equally possible , but there just are n't enough hours in the day . ”
Stobber said she still considers herself a teacher . Only now , she is guiding coaches instead of students and athletes .
“ I see myself as someone who needs to be there for my coaches and help them , ” she said . “ It 's challenging in this day and age . There 's a lot of time and effort that 's put into it . Not only is it a thankful job , but sometimes it 's a thankless job . ”
There are plenty of rewards that come with the job , though .
“ Giving kids the opportunity to be able to play and be involved in co-curriculars , ” Stobber said . “ I know that had such an impact in my life .
“ Whether it 's winning in the last second of a game , moving on in the playoffs , or performing well in a play … seeing that excitement on their faces and experience something outside of the classroom that they really love is what I enjoy . ”

In what appeared like a Hollywood action movie , the Senator representing Kogi West senatorial district , Dino Melaye , yesterday jumped from a Police vehicle while being transported to his state to face criminal charges levelled against him .
Confirming the incident , the Nigeria Police Force however said after escaping from Police custody , the Senator was re-arrested at Zankli Hospital , Abuja .
Force PRO , ACP Jimoh Moshood , who stated this in a statement yesterday night explained how Senator Melaye escaped from Police custody , saying some hoodlums cornered the Police team conveying the lawmaker to Kogi State and blocked the vehicle at Area 1 , Abuja before the federal lawmaker jumped through the window .
“ At about 1200 hours of yesterday , Sen. Dino Melaye while in lawful custody of the Nigeria Police Force personnel and being taken for arraignment in Federal High Court Lokoja from Abuja , escaped from lawful custody when hoodlums and miscreants in two Toyota Hilux Vehicles blocked the Police vehicle conveying Senator Dino Melaye around Area 1 Round About , Abuja and in the process , the Senator jumped out of the Police vehicle through the window and was rescued from the Police men by hoodlums and miscreants to an unknown destination ” , Moshood said .
The statement further noted that the Police team re-enforced and trailed Senator Melaye to Zankli Hospital , Abuja where he was re-arrested .
Noting that the Senator will be arraigned in court without further delay , Force PRO said the Police investigation team has recovered one of the Toyota Hilux vehicles used by the hoodlums and miscreants in aiding the escape of the lawmaker .
The Force PRO also noted that the Inspector General of Police ( IGP ) , Ibrahim Idris , has directed a thorough investigation into the circumstances leading to the rescue and escape of Senator Melaye from lawful custody .
LEADERSHIP also gathered last night that the embattled Senator has been moved to the National Hospital by police operatives in an ambulance marked NPF 221 D .
Prior to his movement to National Hospital , about 30 police personnel and ambulance were sighted at the Zankli hospital .
But the special adviser on media to Senator Melaye , Mr Gideon Ayodele , denied yesterday that the lawmaker evaded arrest by the Police .
Ayodele , in statement in Abuja , said , “ For the avoidance of doubt , Sen. Melaye had never evaded police invitation before now because there was none extended to him in the first place .
“ Rather , what the Police Force Public Relations Officer , Mr Jimoh Moshood had been doing was to summon the Senator through media briefings , a practice that is unconventional . ”
The statement added that “ he ( Melaye ) , along with his lawyers and personal aides , were driven in his private car to the SARS office in Guzape district of Abuja , among numerous police vehicles earlier deployed to his house .
“ With the media hype the whole saga generated especially his unwarranted travails in the hands of Immigration officials at Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport Abuja on Monday and the attendant but dramatic police siege to his private residence thereafter , it became necessary for Melaye to end the drama , hence his choice to appear before the Police . ”
Melaye 's aide further said said they were “ constrained to make the record straight sequel to avalanche of calls by well-meaning Nigerians and supporters ” .
LONDON ( Reuters ) - Iran 's foreign ministry summoned the French and Belgian ambassadors and Germany 's chargé d'affaires in protest at the arrest of an Iranian diplomat in Germany , Fars news agency reported on Wednesday , citing the ministry .
`` The Iranian deputy foreign minister expressed the Islamic Republic 's strong protest over the arrest of an Iranian diplomat and emphasised that due to the immunity of diplomats in the Vienna Convention , he should be released without any delay and with no condition , '' ministry spokesman Bahram Qasemi was quoted as saying .
He added the arrest was a plot to damage Iran-European ties , especially at a time when Iranian President Hassan Rouhani was in Europe to save an international nuclear deal following Washington 's withdrawal from the landmark accord .

BERLIN ( Reuters ) - German Chancellor Angela Merkel 's conservatives and the Social Democrats ( SPD ) reached agreement on energy and agriculture on Saturday , but were still in dispute over healthcare during talks to form a government , more than four months after the election .
The two camps aim to seal a deal by the end of Sunday to renew the “ grand coalition ” that has governed since 2013 , although some politicians say they could run into Monday or Tuesday .
Speaking at the end of talks on Saturday , conservative politician Michael Grosse-Broemer said the two blocs intended to stick to the timeframe but issues like labour policy , healthcare and rents still needed to be resolved .
“ The coalition treaty is slowly taking shape but we 'll only be able to say with more certainty tomorrow whether it will come to a conclusion , ” he said .
SPD deputy Manuela Schwesig urged the conservatives to compromise on abolishing fixed-term contracts for workers and reforming Germany 's public-private healthcare system .
“ I do n't think Mrs Merkel can explain why there ca n't be any movement there , ” she said as she arrived for talks .
The SPD wants to prove to its sceptical members that it would be able to push through those core policies in the role of junior partner to make another “ grand coalition ” more appealing .
Many of the SPD 's 443,000 members - who will get to vote on any coalition deal - would prefer their party to revamp in opposition rather than join another alliance with Merkel after suffering their worst post-war election result in September .
Healthcare is a big stumbling block and party sources said Merkel and her Bavarian ally Horst Seehofer discussed the issue before meeting the SPD .
Most Germans have public health insurance , but a minority , mainly high earners , have private insurance instead . The SPD wants to replace the system with one insurance system for all , a change the conservatives reject .
Talks are now expected to focus on improving public healthcare , such as by changing billing rules for doctors , who earn more by treating private patients .

The parties are not expected to come to an agreement on the most controversial issues , which include healthcare and labour market policy , until the near the end of negotiations .
The conservatives have offered to ban the repeated renewal of fixed-term contracts but do not want to prevent employers from using them as the SPD demands .
The two camps made some progress on labour policy on Friday by agreeing that employees in companies with more than 45 workers should have the right to move seamlessly back and forth between full- and part-time employment .
ENERGY AND FARMING
In a sign they are getting closer to a deal , the parties reached an accord on energy and the environment , agreeing to set legally binding climate targets for sectors like energy , transport , agriculture and construction to reach by 2030 .
Environment Minister and SPD member Barbara Hendricks said national climate targets for 2020 would not be quite reached but the new targets , which would be written into law in 2019 , would ensure Germany can remain a “ climate protection pioneer ” .
They also agreed on agriculture , saying they wanted to put an end to the use of weedkiller glyphosate as quickly as possible and ban the cultivation of genetically modified plants .
They reached a deal on migration on Friday , agreeing to stick to the wording of January 's coalition blueprint that said the parties did not expect annual migration to exceed 220,000 per year .
But the two blocs were still wrangling over its meaning on Saturday , with Joachim Herrmann - a member of Merkel 's CSU Bavarian allies who have called for an upper limit - telling the Rheinische Post his party had secured a migrant cap .
SPD deputy Ralf Stegner said the number was merely a prediction , writing on Twitter : “ The fact remains that the SPD has not agreed to any upper limit and will not do so . ”
Migration is a sensitive issue given the influx of more than a million migrants since mid-2015 and the conservatives ' subsequent loss of support to the anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany ( AfD ) in September 's national election .

That 's the idea and outcome here with this Tesla Model S P100D .
Video comes to us courtesy of Tesla Racing Channel . The record , set by the gutted Model S P100D , is no surprise really as the folks at Tesla Racing Channel have been hard at work over recent months making this Model S quicker and quicker by way of massive weight reductions .
The new record time for a Model S in the 1/4-mile stands at 10.41 seconds at 125.12 mph . That 's just a tick or two quicker than the old record ( also held by Tesla Racing Channel at 10.44 seconds ) .

Sportchek Women at Chinook Mall showcases all body types and it was an intentional decision to reflect “ realistic ” body shapes .
“ Sportchek Women was designed for women by women and we wanted to ensure we were speaking to all body types for comfort and inclusivity , ” said Kara Anastasiadis , assistant VP of merchandising strategy for Forzani Group Ltd .
Shoppers have been taking notice of the diverse mannequins .
“ All of us are different and some of us have issues with weight and image , ” Pat Grue said .
“ It 's nice to go somewhere and you 're accepted . ”
Aspiring “ plus-size ” model Amanda Boudjaklian applauds the concept .
“ You see something on the mannequin and want to try it on and it does n't look good on you , ” Boudjaklian said .
“ It 's nice for the fashion industry to see it should be open to more people . It 's tough shopping when you 're size 12 or 14 . ”
Boudjaklian entered a contest to be featured as Addition-Elle 's model . The womenswear chain launched a contest for interested models to apply .
The 20-year-old Calgarian was selected among thousands of entries as a semi-finalist .
“ I never thought I could be a part of modelling industry . ”
“ Size zero was all it was . Models are demonstrated as thin and I never thought it would happen to me , ” Boudjaklian said .
Voters are asked to cast a ballot online to choose a fan favorite for the model search finalists .
Matthias Erb , the engineer tasked with turning VW 's North American operations from car importer to full-on development office , is n't able to relax for long . Last year , VW finally got competitive in the American crossover market with its redesigned Tiguan and new Atlas . This year , it 's a bigger challenge : reinvigorating a dated compact four-door in a stale segment .
Next month at the 2018 North American International Auto Show in Detroit , Erb will take the wraps off of a long-overdue replacement : the 2019 VW Jetta . Its nameplate dates back to 1980 , when VW realized that American buyers were n't as smitten with hatchbacks as Europeans . Then , they lopped off the Golf 's rear gate , welded on a trunk , and called it a Jetta .

It worked then , and Erb is confident that the recipe is just as relevant today .
The 2019 Jetta finally migrates to a version of the automaker 's MQB architecture that now underpins the bulk of VW 's American-market lineup , as well as some of Audi 's .
2019 Volkswagen Jetta prototype Enlarge Photo
It 's everything you 'd expect from VW—a stretched Golf with a trunk instead of a cargo hold . Sure , VW could have tried to spice up the Jetta with a fastback design like the Honda Civic or a curvy body like the Mazda 3 . But VW always takes a subtle approach .
The Jetta 's styling , although obscured by black and white camouflage on the prototypes we saw , is not what will draw customers to showrooms . Instead , it relies on a 3-box look with clean , sharp , conservative lines . LED headlights and taillights are part of the package , presumably to appease the IIHS 's latest Top Safety Pick+ award . VW covered up the interiors on the two prototypes we drove , but what little we could see appears to stick to the brand 's linear convention . Soft-touch trim covers the door uppers for the front seat , but not for the rear , and we saw not a single stitched surface .
MQB goes mainstream
VW 's highly scalable MQB platform can be stretched in every direction , except for the distance between the front axle and the pedals . Erb calls the MQB VW 's “ toolkit ” that can be topped with whatever body fits each region . Here in the U.S. , you 'll find it under the mid-size Atlas three-row crossover , but it 's also the basis of the brand 's Polo subcompact sold abroad . The new Jetta grows about two inches overall compared to the outgoing model , and its wheelbase is 1.3-inches longer . It 's less than an inch wider , but a lower dashboard and reshaped seats make it feel wider . The rear seat remains spacious , with enough room for a pair of 6-footers to sit one in front of the other , even with a moonroof . Oddly , the Jetta lacks rear-seat climate control vents .
Like its MQB siblings , the Jettas we drove at the automaker 's hot weather proving grounds near Phoenix were unflustered at high speeds and able to scoot through corners with a sense of stoicism . A 1.4-liter turbocharged inline-4 will sit under the hood , mated to either an 8-speed automatic or a 6-speed manual . We drove only the automatic , and so will most consumers when the 2019 Jetta goes on sale early next year .

Do n't expect the manual to turn the Jetta into a sport sedan , at least in standard guise . The Jetta prototypes—one a relatively low-spec model and another a loaded one with a quartet of selectable drive modes that adjust throttle response , shift points , and steering heft—were composed even when pushed hard on their modest 17-inch Bridgestone Ecopia tires . A brisk desert wind only made its presence notable around the prototype 's mirrors , even at the Jetta 's 125 mph terminal velocity . Straight-line stability was excellent and the three-spoke steering wheel responded smoothly to the driver 's gentle inputs .
At least two policemen were killed and eight others injured as a suicide bomber detonated an explosive-laden vest in Pakistan 's southwestern city of Quetta on Tuesday , local media reported .
The attack took place at the airport road of Quetta . Additional contingents of security forces and rescue teams along with a bomb disposal squad rushed to the site and shifted the bodies and the injured to the Combined Military Hospital in the city .
At least six policemen were among the injured . The death toll might further rise as four of the injured are in critical condition , according to hospital sources .
According to reports , heavy firing was also heard after the attack . Security forces have cordoned off the site and launched a search operation in the nearby areas to arrest the accomplices of the attackers .
No group has claimed the attack yet .
Meanwhile , two other suicide attackers on Tuesday tried to attack security personnel present at a camp of Frontier Corps , a paramilitary force , in the Mian Gundi area located at the outskirts of Quetta , the provincial capital of southwest Balochistan province .
The two attackers were killed on the spot and no security personnel was killed , according to the army 's media wing of Inter-Services Public Relations .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - U.S. job growth likely accelerated in January and wages increased further , underscoring the strong momentum in the economy at the start of the year .
Nonfarm payrolls probably increased by 180,000 jobs last month , according to a Reuters survey of economists , after rising 148,000 in December . The unemployment rate is forecast unchanged at a 17-year low of 4.1 percent .
The Labor Department will release its closely watched employment report on Friday at 08:30 am ( 1330 GMT ) .
Economists say employment gains are being driven by buoyant domestic and global demand . They saw little boost to job growth from the Trump administration 's $ 1.5 billion tax cut package passed by the Republican-controlled U.S. Congress in December , in the biggest overhaul of the tax code in 30 years .
“ I do n't think there will be much impact on job growth , in part because the economy is pretty much at full employment , ” said Robert Murphy , an associate economics professor at Boston College . “ The impact is going to be more on the wage/income side . We will start to see more pressure on wages . ”
President Donald Trump and his fellow Republicans have cast the fiscal stimulus , which includes a reduction in the corporate income tax rate to 21 percent from 35 percent , as creating jobs and boosting economic growth .
According to outplacement consultancy firm Challenger , Gray & Christmas , only seven companies , including Apple , had announced plans to add roughly a combined 37,000 new jobs in response to the tax cuts as of the end of January .
January 's anticipated jobs gains will be below the monthly average of 204,000 over the past 3 months . The economy needs to create 75,000 to 100,000 jobs per month to keep up with growth in the working-age population .
Job growth is slowing as the labor market nears full employment . Companies are increasingly reporting difficulties finding qualified workers , which economists say will force some to significantly raise wages as they compete for scarce labor .
MINIMUM WAGE INCREASES
Average hourly earnings are forecast rising 0.3 percent in January after a similar gain in December . That would lift the year-on-year increase in average hourly earnings to 2.6 percent from 2.5 percent in December .
The anticipated rise in wages will reflect increases in the minimum wage which came into effect in 18 states last month . Wages could also get a lift from the tax cut . Companies like Starbucks Corp and FedEx Corp have said they will use some of the savings from lower taxes to boost wages for workers .
Further gains are likely in February when Walmart raises entry-level wages for hourly employees at its U.S. stores .
Annual wage growth remains below the 3 percent that economists say is needed to push inflation towards the Federal Reserve 's 2 percent target . Fed officials on Wednesday expressed optimism that inflation will rise toward its target this year .
Policymakers , who voted to keep interest rates unchanged , described the labor market as having “ continued to strengthen , ” and economic activity as “ rising at a solid rate. ” U.S. financial markets are expecting a rate hike in March .
“ A solid jobs market environment , together with a pickup in wage pressure , and on top of healthy U.S. economic activity , will keep the Fed on its charted tightening course , ” said Beth Ann Bovino , U.S. chief economist at S & P Global Ratings in New York .
The U.S. central bank has forecast three rate increases this year . It raised borrowing costs three times in 2017 .
With the January employment report , the government will publish annual “ benchmark ” revisions and update the formulas it uses to smooth the data for regular seasonal fluctuations . It will also incorporate new population estimates .
The government said in its preliminary estimate last September that the level of employment in March 2017 was likely 95,000 higher on a seasonally adjusted basis than it had reported .
The shift in population controls means figures on the labor force or number of employed or unemployed in January would not be directly comparable to December . The unemployment rate dropped seven-tenths of a percentage point in 2017 and economists expect it to hit 3.5 percent by the end of the year .
Employment gains were likely broad in January . Manufacturing payrolls are forecast increasing solidly . The sector is being supported by strong domestic and international demand as well as by a weaker dollar .
Unseasonably cold weather probably slowed hiring at construction sites last month . Retail employment likely rebounded after declining by 20,300 jobs in December .

THE Boweya Wangandary Road fire at the weekend is the first large scale fire in the area for the season and CFA District 23 's top officer is warning conditions are similar to the catastrophic fire season of 2006/07 .
It was the middle of the millennium drought and lightning strikes , high fire fuel volumes , heat and low moisture were all apparent when fire ravaged the North East including the King Valley , Tolmie and Mansfield areas .
District 23 operations manager Stewart Kreltszheim referred to the 91 fires that started all in one week across Victoria recently – many from lightning strikes – as near identical conditions he remembers at the start of summer in 2006 .
Coupled with hotter than normal weather , thick bushland and cured grass across the district , Mr Kreltszheim says they are not ruling out extreme conditions this season .
“ Despite the high rainfalls forecast for the start of summer , there are underlying conditions that we and landholders should be wary about , ” he said .
Up to 60mm of rainfall has been forecast by the Bureau of Meteorology over the next two days and Mr Kreltszheim said this will only encourage more grass growth and potential fire fuel .

New York : Indian American lawyer Kashyap `` Kash '' Patel is the author of the controversial Republican memo critical of the Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) and some Justice Department officials that is roiling the American political landscape , according to media reports .
Patel drafted the document that asserts that there were improprieties in the FBI probe into alleged connections between President Donald Trump 's campaign and the Russian government .
The memo prepared on behalf of the Republican members of the House Intelligence Committee was made public on Friday after Trump cleared its release despite opposition from the FBI and the Democrats .
Patel is on the staff of Representative Devin Nunes , the Republican who is chairman of the committee .
Quoting sources `` familiar with the memo , '' Daily Beast said that Patel `` read the highly classified intelligence it 's based on ( something the Justice Department indicates Nunes has not done ) , drafted the memo , and then dealt with FBI and Justice Department efforts to keep it from being released to the public . ''
He formerly worked for the National Security Division of the Justice Department , as a counter-terrorism prosecuter , Daily Beast reported .
He joined the committee as a senior counter-terrorism counsel last April .
The crux of the Republcian memo is the allegation that the FBI relied on investigations of Trump that was paid for by the Democratic National Committee and lawyers linked to Hillary Clinton 's campaign when applying to a court for permission to wiretap a Trump adviser , Carter Page , and that the FBI did not disclose this fact to the judge .
The anti-Trump dossier was prepared by Christopher Steele , who is described as former British intelligence employee . It was initially commissioned by a right-wing website that was against Trump , but dropped it later and the Democrats then commissioned it .
The memo also alleged that Steele as well as some FBI staffers were anti-Trump and that the wife of Bruce Ohr , a former associate deputy attorney general , worked for FusionGPS , the company through which Steele worked .
The Democrats , who have prepared a counter memo , have said the Republican document is an attempt to wreck the image of the FBI and derail the Russia investigation .
They maintain that the FBI and the courts did not rely on the controversial dossier to get the wiretap approved and that the FBI and Justice Department officials were being smeared .
Patel had made news in 2016 while working for the Justice Department by not wearing a tie while appearing in a federal court .
During a terrorism trial , Patel appeared informally dressed as he had just landed there from Central Asia , abovethelaw.com , reported . Judge Lynn Hughes admonished him for the way he was dressed and demanded to see his passport .

When Paul Kugelman was a kid , he had no shortage of friends . But as he grew older and entered middle age , his social world narrowed .
`` It was a very lonely time . I did go to work and I did have interactions at work , and I cherished those , '' he says . `` But you know , at the end of the day it was just me . ''
The Lonely American Man The Lonely American Man Listen · 48:07 48:07
Kugelman 's story is n't unusual : researchers say it can be difficult for men to hold on to friendships as they age . And the problem may begin in adolescence .
New York University psychology professor Niobe Way , who has spent decades interviewing adolescent boys , points to the cultural messages boys get early on .
`` These are human beings with unbelievable emotional and social capacity . And we as a culture just completely try to zip it out of them , '' she says .
This week on Hidden Brain , we look at what happens when half the population gets the message that needing others is a sign of weakness and that being vulnerable is unmanly .

Barkley said he already knows what his first big purchase will be after signing his rookie deal .
`` I would n't be the man that I am today without my mom and my father , '' said the 21-year-old . `` So , I 'm definitely going to buy those two a house that they can call home and not have to worry about anything . ''
As for the smaller purchases , Barkley said he 's had his eye on the Air Jordan XI Low `` Concord '' since he was a kid . The All-American , who recently signed a deal with Nike , spoke about what it means to be part of the Swoosh family and follow in the footsteps of legends like Bo Jackson .
`` That 's something you think about as a little kid . This shoe [ Nike Air Trainer SC Bo Jackson ] means a lot to me as a running back and a player , '' said Barkley . `` In the football world , not many guys have really broke out in the shoe industry -- and his shoe is still popular to this day . He 's such an icon . ''

PEARL HARBOR , Hawaii ( Reuters ) - The U.S. military on Wednesday renamed its Pacific Command the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command , in a largely symbolic move underscoring the growing importance of India to the Pentagon , U.S. officials said .
U.S. Pacific Command , which is responsible for all U.S. military activity in the greater Pacific region , has about 375,000 civilian and military personnel assigned to its area of responsibility , which includes India .
`` Relationships with our Pacific and Indian Ocean allies and partners have proven critical to maintaining regional stability , '' U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said in prepared remarks .
`` In recognition of the increasing connectivity between the Indian and Pacific Oceans , today we rename the U.S. Pacific Command to U.S. Indo-Pacific Command , '' Mattis said .
He was speaking during a change of command ceremony . Admiral Philip Davidson was assuming leadership of the command from Admiral Harry Harris , who is President Donald Trump 's nominee to be ambassador to South Korea .
The renaming does not mean additional assets will be sent to the region at this time , but rather recognises India 's increasing military relevance for the United States .
In 2016 , the United States and India signed an agreement governing the use of each other 's land , air and naval bases for repair and resupply , a step toward building defence ties as they seek to counter the growing maritime assertiveness of China .
The United States is also keen to tap into India 's large defence market . It has emerged as India 's No . 2 weapons supplier , closing $ 15 billion worth of deals over the last decade .
Mattis has been pushing for a waiver for countries like India , after Trump signed a law last year which said that any country trading with Russia 's defence and intelligence sectors would face sanctions .
`` I think India and the relationship with the United States is the potentially most historic opportunity we have in the 21st-century and I intend to pursue that quite rigorously , '' Davidson , the incoming head of the command , said last month .
However , experts said the name change would mean little unless it was tied to a broader strategy .
`` Renaming PACOM is ultimately a symbolic act ... ( it ) will have a very limited impact unless the U.S. follows through with a significant array of initiatives and investments that reflect a wider aperture , '' said Abraham Denmark , a former deputy assistant secretary of defence for East Asia under President Barack Obama .

Rams linebacker Robert Quinn stood on the sideline and raised a fist during the playing of the national anthem before Saturday 's preseason game against the Cowboys , continuing a practice he started last season .
“ It 's not to cause a scene , ” Quinn said Monday after practice . “ To me , it 's more awareness and a sense do n't forget where you come from . ”
Last season , San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick sat or kneeled during the anthem to protest what he says is police brutality and racial oppression in the United States . Kaepernick is now an unsigned free agent .
For Quinn , raising a fist represents more than a protest .
“ It's… not only just a stance but an appreciation to honestly the ancestors that made the way for and gave opportunities for me and others that came along the way , ” Quinn said . “ It 's more of an appreciation and a stance that not all has been forgotten . ”
Quinn said he discussed raising a fist with coach Sean McVay to ensure he would not become a distraction . McVay , like former coach Jeff Fisher , insisted that he stand with the team , Quinn said , but did not discourage him from expressing himself .
“ I 've got a lot of respect for what the national anthem represents for our country but everybody has their own reasons or certain beliefs , ” McVay said . “ I think you want to be respectful and mindful of that but I think we want to allow guys to express themselves in whatever way they see fit .
“ And Robert 's a guy that 's well thought through . As long as it 's respectful then I think everybody 's entitled to handle it the way they want to . ”

Taylor Swift has kept a relatively low profile while her sixth studio album Reputation tops the charts and her fans gobble up a holiday helping of confessional new music . Over the weekend , however , Swift made an exception by performing at the Jingle Bell Ball in London .
Related : Taylor Swift Pens New Poem ‘ The Trick to Holding On '
Her headlining set included a combination of hits from 1989 and Reputation including “ Blank Space ” and “ Shake It Off ” from the former . From the latter , Taylor performed “ Gorgeous , ” “ Look What You Made Me Do ” and “ …Ready For It ? ” For good measure , Swift threw in a solo rendition of her duet with Zayn Malik : “ I Do n't Wan na Live Forever . ”
The performance followed almost a month after her November 11 appearance on Saturday Night Live . Other acts at the Jingle Bell Ball included Ed Sheeran and Liam Payne .
Watch Taylor perform “ Ready For It , ” “ Gorgeous ” and “ Look What You Made Me Do ” below :
Friday , February 2 , 2018– Tampa , FL – Crate Late Model week started Thursday night and Keith Nosbisch made it look easy as he strolled to the opening night win . Friday night would be much different as several drivers took their turn at the front of the field for the 35 Lap A-Main Feature .
Jack Nosbisch started 7th and ran another steady race to pick up his 2nd top 5 in as many nights .
Walker Authur ran upfront all night and had a good 4th pace finish , but still has n't had the performance we 're used to seeing from the Forrest , VA driver .
Keith Nosbisch tried every line on the track passing cars on the outside during the race , and at the bottom on restarts , but at the end , settled for a hard-fought 3rd finish .
Nevin Gainey finished 2nd and might have been the story of the night after starting 8th in the field , and in 8 laps , had worked his way to the lead . But it was his teammate Clay Harris that had his Rocket alongside Gainey as they went side-by-side for the lead for several laps . Unfortunately , Harris had overheating issues and was unable to finish the race .
Doug Horton had started on the pole for the 35 lap A-Main , but fell as far back as fifth . Horton was committed to the top early on , but realized it was n't going to hold , and adjusted his line to the very bottom of the track and finessed his # 11 Adam 's Used Auto Parts , Billy Moyer Victory Circle to win number 1 of the 2018 season .
Eagle Jett Top Gun Sprints opened up their 2018 season on Friday night and Hayden Campbell was in a league to himself . His car was working on top and bottom and just when lapped traffic appeared that it might slow Campbell up , he sliced through the pack , putting several good cars a lap down . Campbell went on to easily get his 1st victory of the season .
Anthony D Alessio finished 2nd , AJ Maddox 3rd , Matt Kurtz 4th and Bryan Eckley rounded out the top 5 .
Action continues Saturday night as we conclude Crate Late Model and Top Gun Sprint week . Hot Laps begin around 630pm and qualifying and racing action to follow . For more information you can visit us on the web at ebrp.co or call 813-677-7223 .

Nigel LaFrance , who is charged with the first-degree murdering of Anthony Yasinski , 26 , made his first appearance on the witness stand at the Fort McMurray Courthouse on Dec. 4 , arguing he had planned to rob the man and not kill him .
LaFrance , who was 19 at the time of the Mar . 17 , 2015 attack , wiped away tears as he recalled as much as he said he could remember regarding the fight that ended with Yasinski 's death .
On the morning of March 17 , 2015 , LaFrance sent a text message to Yasinski asking if he could buy cocaine from him .
LaFrance had already bought cocaine from the man twice that morning .
LaFrance confirmed previous testimony from his girlfriend at the time , Michalla Jones , that he had planned to rob Yasinski because he needed the money for food . Jones had previously said money was always a factor for the couple , who were both unemployed at the time .
Yasinski picked up LaFrance from his Prairie Creek home and drove to a secluded spot , because LaFrance 's father was home . LaFrance had a hunting knife with him , but said it was for intimidation .
When the vehicle stopped , LaFrance said he took out his knife to threaten Yasinski .
At this point , he said his memory of the ensuing fight was a blur . The only details LaFrance appeared to remember was being being told “ you 're going to die ” during the fight , and being pulled towards Yasinski as he tried to get the knife .
LaFrance said he had a finger through a loop on the knife 's handle , stopping Yasinski from getting it .
While being questioned by his defence lawyer , Gregory Lazin , LaFrance said the next thing he remembered was being covered in blood .
Yasinski had run away , so LaFrance grabbed $ 80 and two cell phones from the car before leaving .
Yasinski would die hours later at the Northern Lights Regional Health Centre from stab wounds to the neck and head .
LaFrance was arrested and charged Apr . 7 , 2015 .
During cross-examination on Tuesday , Crown attorney Walter Devenz pointed out LaFrance had told police he lunged towards Yasinski , citing footage from the interrogation played before the court .
“ I pulled the knife out of my pocket and I lunged at him , ” he told the officer . “ I was n't aiming for a certain spot . ”
Devenz also suggested LaFrance was angry Yasinski would not accept collateral for cocaine anymore , and that food was not as big a priority as he said since the $ 80 was spent on cigarettes .

OTTAWA – Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland will give some idea of what Canada 's priorities will be in renegotiations of the North American Free Trade Agreement .
She 's going to give a speech in Ottawa this morning just days before Canadian negotiators sit down with their American and Mexican counterparts in Washington .
READ MORE : NAFTA , Trump and the cloud : What the negotiations mean for your personal data
A senior government official tells The Canadian Press that the speech will provide more details on Ottawa 's NAFTA priorities . But the official says Freeland is unlikely to lay out too many details at this stage .
The priorities will include a desire for new sections in the agreement covering labour and the environment .

Some officials have said there is good reason for new labour protections – increased wages in Mexico would narrow the gap in labour costs , making it more attractive to invest in auto plants in Canada and the U-S .
Canada has also repeatedly pushed for extending its Buy American exemptions for national public-works projects , to the state and local level .
Reza Shah 's rise gave birth to what has become modern Iran , which was still called Persia until he ordered foreign diplomats to cease using the name .

SEOUL ( Reuters ) - South Korean automakers face a major headwind from a weakening Japanese yen , which will boost rivals like Toyota Motor Corp. ( 7203.T ) next year , a Hyundai Motor ( 005380.KS ) think tank said .
The logo of Hyundai Motor is seen on wall at a event of Hyundai Motor Co 's new Accent in Mexico City , Mexico August 2 , 2017 . REUTERS/Henry Romero
The fall in the yen will intensify competition in major markets , such as China and the United States , where overall demand is expected to shrink in 2018 , the think tank said .
It projected that the Korean won would fetch 978 per 100 yen next year , compared with 1,018 this year .
The re-election in November of Japan 's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe , who favors massive monetary and fiscal stimulus policies , should point to further yen weakness , the think tank said .
Toyota Motor in November raised its forecast for full-year operating profit , in part due to expectations of a weaker yen , which can make goods exported from Japan cheaper and can boost the value of overseas profits when they are repatriated .
“ The currency environment is expected to deteriorate next year , ” Lee Bo-sung , a director of the think tank , the Global Business Intelligence Center , said at a press briefing on Friday . The contents of the briefing were embargoed until 9 am Sunday Seoul time ( 0000 GMT ) .
“ The weaker yen is expected to be the biggest challenge for South Korean automakers next year , as they are competing against Japanese , ” Lee said .
He said the price gap between Korean and Japanese cars had already narrowed due to the yen 's decline . For example , Hyundai 's Sonata sedan was 10 percent cheaper than Honda 's ( 7267.T ) Accord in the United States in 2011 and the gap is only 2 percent this year , he said .
A weaker yen and higher profit have also allowed Japanese carmakers to boost investment and gain market share in China and other emerging markets , Hyundai 's stronghold , he said .
Hyundai Motor has seen its net profit tumble by nearly one-third so far this year , and is on track to miss its annual vehicle sales target by a large margin , having failed to position for a consumer swing to sport utility vehicles ( SUVs ) and a diplomatic row with Beijing that hit Korean-made products .
Hyundai Motor said on Friday it plans to roll out three SUVs next year in the United States - the redesigned Santa Fe , the Kona , and the tweaked Tucson , to revive its sales momentum . In China next year , Hyundai and Kia plan to release three China-targeted small SUVs next year .
Islamabad - Imagine how hard life would be if one has little to eat or drink , no shelter or access to healthcare , and no resources to get an education . Imagine how would it feel at a tender age when one sees others wearing expensive clothes , eating delicious meals , and going to school ? Unfortunately , this is the life story of a large number of homeless children in the twin cities . The heart-rending reality is they have no hope for a better future .
Bare foot , clad in a dirty dress , and having filthy hair , 12 year old Kiran along with her seven year old sister Nazia , lives under the overhead bridge of 6th Road Metro Station in Rawalpindi .
Kiran is native of Multan . She moved to Rawalpindi when life became difficult for her in Multan . Kiran is the second oldest of her five siblings . Both sisters walk around in the streets of the city scavenging for food . Wherever they find any leftover food , be it by the side of the road , near shops or garbage bins , they eat it . This is how most of their days are spent .
Kiran says that her parents were old and sick . Because of their ailment , they were not in a position to do any kind of physical labour and look after their children . “ Now it is left for me to earn a living and fulfil the needs of my siblings , ” she said .
“ I collect garbage from the homes of people and they pay me in return . Good people do exist in this world . Sometimes they give me 10 to 20 rupees extra and this helps me a lot , ” Kiran added .
With tears in her eyes , Kiran adds that the sight of school-going children makes her sad because she can not imagine being able to afford an education . “ I used to follow school going girls and watch them playing in playgrounds of school . I can not play with them because the guard outside the school gate would n't let me inside , ” Kiran added .
She cried that the life of homeless children was always at risk because they had to face violence , and harassment on the streets . “ Boys used to tease me but I never let them misbehave , ” Kiran said proudly .
There are thousands of Kirans living a homeless existence on the streets of Pakistan . It is estimated that there is 1.2 to 1.5 million street children in major cities of Pakistan . Children under 18 , when deprived of shelter , food , health care , education and other fundamental necessities of life and are compelled to make street as their home are known as street children . The major causes of the increasing number of street children are domestic violence , violence at school , poverty , natural as well as man-made disasters , and unemployment . These children are human but they are deprived of all the rights which human beings should possess .
Habiba Salman , a child rights activist , while sharing her concerns about street children said it was the children who worked on the streets , doing menial jobs such as sweeping , begging , and collecting garbage , who were the real children . She added that education , health facility , food , and shelter were the fundamental right of every citizen of Pakistan and it was the responsibility of the government to provide these basic necessities .
Further , Habiba emphasized that keeping in mind the current conditions in which the street children live , child protection in Pakistan was an essential requirement of the hour .
“ There were some child protection centres and sweet homes in Sindh , Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa but they were unable to fully accommodate all the street children , ” she added .
The child rights activist added that although there was a National Child Protection Centre it was “ no more than a joke ” .
The building , she added , a hostel situated in H-Sector of Islamabad was not very functional and was in need of government attention .
She further said that at the national level there was a child protection act regarding child labor but that it was not implemented the way it should have .
Habiba stressed that this social issue required the urgent attention of not only the government , but also that of NGOs and the society in general .
Adequate budget should be allocated for the welfare of the street children .
Government alone is not responsible for looking into these issues . Institutions such as those of family also carry the responsibility to address these challenges in the society . If each citizen tries to contribute on their part then it is possible for crime free , prosperous and peaceful Pakistan to come into being .

Women Who Accused President Trump Of Sexual Misconduct Want Congress To Investigate With allegations of sexual harassment and assault in the forefront of politics , women who have accused President Trump of misconduct are renewing calls for him to be held accountable .
Taking care of a cut or scrape usually means swapping out the bandage a few times , and maybe putting a little healing cream or hydrogel on there . But what if the dressing could dispense that stuff on its own ? That 's the idea behind a smart bandage now being tested by engineers from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln , Harvard and MIT .
Instead of plain sterile cotton or other fibers , this dressing is made of “ composite fibers with a core electrical heater covered by a layer of hydrogel containing thermoresponsive drug carriers , ” which really says it all .
It acts as a regular bandage , protecting the injury from exposure and so on , but attached to it is a stamp-sized microcontroller . When prompted by an app ( or an onboard timer , or conceivably sensors woven into the bandage ) , the microcontroller sends a voltage through certain of the fibers , warming them and activating the medications lying dormant in the hydrogel .
Those medications could be anything from topical anesthetics to antibiotics to more sophisticated things like growth hormones that accelerate healing . More voltage , more medication — and each fiber can carry a different one .
“ This is the first bandage that is capable of dose-dependent drug release , ” said UN-L 's Ali Tamayol in a news release . “ You can release multiple drugs with different release profiles . That 's a big advantage in comparison with other systems . ”
In a paper published in the journal Advanced Functional Materials , the team documents how in tests , critters ( not humans — those tests come later ) healed better when given the active bandage . They also made sure that the heat did n't affect the healing process or the medication .
For ordinary scrapes a normal bandage ( or plaster , for our friends across the pond ) is probably still more than sufficient — this is for people whose healing processes are inhibited , or for whom frequent dressing changes are impossible or inconvenient .
Next up , in addition to further testing to satisfy the FDA , is investigating how to integrate sensors with the fibers , to measure blood glucose levels , pH and other indicators of how the healing process is going . Maybe soon your bandage will even include a progress bar .

After being verbally assaulted by a transgender woman during a reading at Barnes & Noble on Wednesday , Rose McGowan has cancelled all her upcoming press appearances .

I would like an apology from the manager of the Union Square @ BNUnionSquareNY and all security people , and the audience , who did nothing and let the paid verbal assault of an assaulted woman happen . Cool ? — rose mcgowan ( @ rosemcgowan ) February 2 , 2018
During her very first book reading session , a trans woman , marked as Andi Dier , asked McGowan about the remarks that she made on the trans women . In July last year , during a podcast , McGowan had said that the trans women are not developed as women even though they felt like a woman on the inside . This past remark by her became the apple of discord .
Huffington Post reports McGowan replied to the Trans woman as saying , “ I 'm not worried , I 'm fucking mad with the lies , ” the actress told the crowd , as seen in video footage of the incident . “ I 'm mad that you put shit on me because I have a fucking vagina and I 'm white or I 'm black or I 'm yellow or I 'm purple . Fuck off ! All of us want to say it . I just do ! ”
However , during her next interview , she opened up about the spat that took place on Thursday and called the trans woman a 'paid plant ' . “ There was a plant last night at my first book reading … definitely , a paid plant that got up and was screaming at me , ” she said .

Hi , and welcome to another edition of Dodgers Dugout . My name is Houston Mitchell , and I 'm waiting to see what Santa brings the Dodgers for Christmas .
Strike three ?
So what 's the big news since last we talked ? Well , the Dodgers did n't get Giancarlo Stanton . They did n't get Shohei Ohtani . And they lost Brandon Morrow to the Cubs . Let 's look at those one at a time .
After blocking potential trades to the Giants and Cardinals , Stanton agreed to a deal with the New York Yankees , who only had to give up Starlin Castro ; one of their top 30 prospects , right-handed pitcher Jorge Guzman ; and minor league shortstop Jose Devers .
The Yankees also agreed to pick up $ 265 million of the $ 295 million remaining on Stanton 's contract . And that is why the Dodgers did n't get him . This was a straight salary dump by the Miami Marlins , who are looking to reduce their payroll . There was really no way that the Dodgers were going to put themselves on the hook for $ 265 million to a player who will be 37 by the time his contract expires .
Sure , Stanton has an opt-out clause after the 2020 season , but very few expect him to opt out because he will still have $ 223 million left on his deal and probably would n't be able to better that .
The Dodgers have always taken the long view in situations like this . Andrew Friedman and Farhan Zaidi want a team that can vie for the playoffs every season . And while Stanton would have provided a short-term benefit , his contract would become an anchor in a very short time , hampering the team 's efforts to improve in other areas or sign other free agents it may want . Just look at the Angels after they signed Josh Hamilton and Albert Pujols .
So , I 'm OK with not getting Stanton .
Ohtani signed with the Angels and should be a star for them . By wanting to play as a pitcher and a hitter , Ohtani really left himself no option except an AL team , where he can DH between starts and not mess up the starting rotation schedule . If he had signed with the Dodgers he would probably have had this schedule : Starting pitcher , day off , three days in left field , day off , starting pitcher . Repeat . The Dodgers also had very little money to offer him because of international player rules . And some experts question how his bat will translate to the majors .
So , I 'm not terribly upset about losing on Ohtani , particularly since I can just drive down to Angel Stadium and watch him play .
That leaves Morrow . He agreed to a two-year deal with the Chicago Cubs , leaving the Dodgers without their primary set-up man from last season . Again though , this follows the pattern of Friedman and Zaidi , who basically view set-up men as a dime a dozen . They let Joe Blanton go after he was great in 2016 , and that worked out well . He went to Washington and finished the season with a 5.68 ERA and was generally horrible .
Unless they attempt to sign Wade Davis , expect the Dodgers to do what they do every season : roll out about 12 relievers and switch them around until they find one who pitches as well as Blanton in 2016 and Morrow last season .
Viewing these guys as interchangeable also must make it easier to pitch a guy coming off an arm injury like Morrow in every playoff game except one . Might as well wear him out since he probably wo n't be back .
A new hope
The Dodgers could still come out big winners though . The Marlins are not done shedding payroll , and there 's one name they are shopping who would look great in a Dodgers uniform : Marcell Ozuna .
Ozuna is a 27-year-old left fielder who hit .312/.376/.548 last season with 30 doubles , 37 homers and 126 RBIs . He wo n't be eligible for free agency until 2020 , so he will be under team control for a while . He 's also a Gold Glove winner . He 'd fit in rather nicely at left for the Dodgers , giving them a lineup of :
Chris Taylor
Corey Seager
Justin Turner
Cody Bellinger
Marcell Ozuna
Yasiel Puig
Austin Barnes
Logan Forsythe
That 's a good lineup right there . The Dodgers are already World Series favorites in Las Vegas , and would remain there with this trade . And if the Marlins are serious about lowering the payroll , perhaps he could be acquired without giving up too many prospects .
While I was n't disappointed to see Stanton and Ohtani end up elsewhere , I 'd be disappointed to see Ozuna traded to anyone other than the Dodgers . It seems like a deal they can , and should , make .
By the way
The Dodgers also lost relievers Grant Dayton and Josh Ravin to the Atlanta Braves . Dayton was claimed off waivers , and Ravin was traded to the Braves for cash .
And finally
Who are the greatest Dodgers of all time ? Look for more on this after the holidays as I turn to you to help decide . Start thinking about your top 10 . Voting will begin in January . Until then , enjoy your holidays !

Classic Motor Sports in Grand Traverse County stunned after this man left them with thousands of dollars in damage and stole pricey items .
The sheriff 's office says it happened between midnight and one Monday morning .
9 & 10 's Megan Woods has more details on the crime and how the powersport community is helping out .
“ Your first reaction is wow , someone physically broke something to steal . ”
Sales manager of Classic Motor Sports , Tyler Cole says this is n't the first time someone stole from them , but it is the first time someone went through all this trouble . “ We were all in a lot of shock just because the nature of how it was done and then your first thought is what else did he do , has he broke into other businesses and homes and until he 's caught what else is he going to do . ”
It 's the same thought running through other dealerships ' minds like Epic Powersports .
Owner Matt Harris says , “ It concerns me that someone could break in , know what they were picking up so fast , to know the right things at a bike shop to steal you know thousands and thousands of dollars . For a small shop like us that could be crippling this time of the year to get that inventory back being at the height of the season . ”
That 's why they decided to offer a reward to maybe put an end to the thief 's future plans .
Harris says , “ We offered a $ 500 in store credit for anyone that could kind of lead to this person , we want to keep our area clean and keep those people off the streets . ”
The outpouring of community support is why Classic Motor Sports believes justice will be served .
Cole says , “ We are just thrilled and amazed at how many people care , so many people care , nobody likes a thief as it turns out and so everybody is really spreading the word . ”
The sheriff 's office says the man left on a sport style motorcycle parked at a nearby business .

LILONGWE- ( MaraviPost ) -The former President Joyce Banda says her security is compromised ahead of the 2019 Tripartite Elections as government has disarmed her security personnel .
Banda 's spokesperson Andekuche Chanthunya told the Nation Newspaper that government is also failing to allocate vehicles to the former president which is contrary to the Presidential Privileges Act .
“ Nothing has really changed except giving the former president a house . She is using personal vehicles despite the Presidential Privileges Act stating otherwise , ” said Chanthunya
But government spokesperson Nicholas Dausi said Banda should follow up with relevant authorities if she has issues on her terminal benefits .
“ What is so special with Joyce Banda that she always complains about her benefits ? She will not get anything from government through complaints . Let her follow State etiquette and protocol , and follow up with relevant authorities , ” he said .
The country 's first female president told a church gathering in May that government started paying her monthly retirement benefits last year , stating that she gets MK1.1 million .
She , however , said there are still unpaid arrears for 2016 .
Banda said she tithed part of the 2017 payment to her church in Zomba and promised to tithe part of her 2016 arrears to the Livingstonia Synod of the CCAP church in Mzuzu .
Banda , fondly called JB , claims she has struggled to get her benefits from the Democratic Progressive Party ( DPP ) government which ousted her from power in 2014 .
Some of the benefits include security , a retirement house , vehicles and gratuity .

A Yorkshire author has chosen atmospheric Ilkley Moor as the setting for her harrowing new novel .
Sanjida Kay has returned to her hometown to speak about The Stolen Child at the Ilkley Literature Festival this month .
The writer , who grew up in the village of Ben Rhydding , was always inspired by the brooding presence of the moor and was determined to incorporate it into a plot .
The thriller tells the story of a happy family who face the devastation of losing a child when their daughter , Evie , is abducted .
Kay 's techniques involve contrasting 'ordinary ' life in the Dales town with the mysteries and dark secrets of the wild moorland .
The author , who now lives in Bristol , will speak at St Margaret 's Church in Ilkley this Sunday at 4.30pm .
Actress Billie Lourd has reached out to her fans and thanked them for their support following the deaths of her mother Carrie Fisher and grandmother Debbie Reynolds last week .
The Star Wars actress passed away on Dec. 27 after suffering a heart attack and , the next day , Fisher 's movie star mother Debbie Reynolds died following a stroke .
Family spokesman Simon Halls released a press statement on behalf of Billie shortly after Fisher 's death . It read :
“ It is with a very deep sadness that Billie Lourd confirms that her beloved mother Carrie Fisher passed away at 8:55 this morning . She was loved by the world and she will be missed profoundly . Our entire family thanks you for your thoughts and prayers . ”
The 24-year-old has now broken her silence on social media by penning an emotional tribute on Instagram .
“ Receiving all of your prayers and kind words over the past week has given me strength during a time I thought strength could not exist , ” she writes alongside a picture of herself as young child with her mother and grandma .
“ There are no words to express how much I will miss my Abadaba and my one and only Momby . Your love and support means the world to me . ”
Meanwhile , Lourd 's uncle Todd Fisher recently confirmed the family is planning a joint funeral service , which will honour the bond between mother and daughter .
“ It 's what we want to do , but we 're still working on the mechanics , ” he said . “ I 'm going out right now to look at places ... We like the idea , if it 's at all possible . I think it 's appropriate . ”
There are also plans for a second larger public memorial , where fans can pay their respects and say goodbye .
Todd has been spotted visiting the Hollywood Forever Cemetery in Los Angeles , where many famous figures have been buried . Debbie has a family plot there , according to TMZ .
Before his mother died , Todd told ABC News he was letting Billie make the big decisions about her mum 's memorial service .
“ Carrie loves a good party , so , you know , I 'm sure she 'll want to throw a party for her , ” he said .

LONDON , Feb 2 ( Reuters ) - Sterling extended losses on Friday and fell to the day 's lows after a U.S. report showing wages rose at their fastest clip since 2009 hit the currency which was already struggling thanks to weak data from Britain 's construction sector .
U.S. job growth surged in January and wages increased further , recording their largest annual gain in more than 8-1/2 years , bolstering expectations that inflation will push higher this year as the labor market hits full employment .
“ Sterling is feeling the heat from the dollar move across the board but markets are cautious about betting excessively against the pound before next week where the BOE may surprise markets , ” said Lee Hardman , an FX strategist at MUFG in London .
Sterling slipped to the day 's low of $ 1.4137 after the data , down around 0.75 percent on the day . It was also 0.4 percent weaker against the euro , at 87.975 pence .
For the week , sterling was still up 1.5 percent against the dollar . Analysts say the currency is being supported by a repricing of Bank of England interest rate hike expectations - several banks are now calling for a rise to come in May , and for another to come later in the year .
That follows testimony on Tuesday from BoE Governor Mark Carney , who sounded a more upbeat tone than previously , saying wage growth was finally picking up and that the focus of the BoE is shifting back to tackling above-target inflation .
“ There does seem to be a will in the Bank of England to reduce policy accommodation . If it were n't for the Brexit-related risks , I would be very confident that they will ( hike ) twice this year , ” Rabobank currency strategist Jane Foley said .
Britain 's construction sector came close to contracting for the first time since September last month as uncertainty linked to Brexit caused new orders to dry up , data showed .
Sterling has also been helped in recent weeks by a lack of major bad news around Brexit , analysts say . Markets largely brushed aside talk of a leadership challenge to British Prime Minister Theresa May , as well as a House of Lords report that said her Brexit legislation plans contained “ fundamental flaws ” .
Data last week showed speculators added to their bets on the pound strengthening further in the most recent week , with net-long positions at their highest since mid-2014 .
“ While the front-end BoE rates market has sold off plenty and sterling has moved significantly higher ( against the dollar ) , we think both moves have further to go , ” Nomura currency strategist Jordan Rochester wrote in a note to clients late on Thursday .
The BoE 's Monetary Policy Committee is seen as almost certain to keep rates at 0.50 percent when it meets next week , however .

Arabian supercar marque W Motors shocked the world in 2013 when it came out with plans for a car with the astronomical price tag of $ 3.4 million . The car was the Lykan Hypersport , and its production run totaled just seven units . W Motors is now ready to start production of the car 's successor , the equally wild Fenyr Supersport .
The Fenyr Supersport was first shown as a concept two years ago . The production version was finally rolled out last month at a special event in Dubai . The event took place in the new flagship showroom of W Motors , located at the upmarket City Walk area of Dubai .
The Fenyr Supersport is n't as exclusive as its predecessor , as the production run has been capped at 25 cars , but W Motors has managed to lift the performance bar higher . Once again working with partners Magna Steyr and Ruf , W Motors has created a bespoke supercar capable of hitting 62 mph from rest in just 2.7 seconds and topping out at 249 mph .
At its core is a lightweight aluminum chassis that 's been wrapped in a carbon fiber body complete with rear-opening suicide-style doors . The powertrain , worked over by the experts at Ruf , is a 3.8-liter twin-turbocharged flat-6 that delivers 780 horsepower and 708 pound-feet of torque . It 's mid-mounted and spins the rear wheels via a 7-speed dual-clutch transmission . Note , the original Fenyr Supersport concept promised as much as 900 hp .
The design is clearly cut from the same cloth as the Lykan Hypersport , though there are subtle elements that help create a more aggressive look , particularly all the extra aero details . The design also looks more polished , especially in the interior which is lined with carbon fiber and Alcantara and utilizes multiple display screens . Responsible for the design was a team led by Anthony Jannarelly , founder of the Jannarelly sports car brand .
If you 're interested , the asking price is a smidge under $ 1.9 million , or quite a bit less than the $ 3.4 million Lykan Hypersport . The reason is partially due to the Fenyr Supersport being not as exclusive as the Lykan Hypersport , as W Motors plans to build 25 units versus the 7 Lykan Hypersports that were built . The car also lacks some of the pricier elements of the Lykan Hypersport such as diamond-encrusted headlights . Oh , and in case you were wondering , the Fenyr name is derived from the name of a powerful wolf in Norse mythology .

The intensifying battle for Champions League places takes centre stage in the Premier League this weekend as Liverpool host Tottenham , while Manchester United and Chelsea seek to recover from damaging defeats .
Just five points now separate United in second from Spurs in fifth , with the riches and prestige of a place in the Champions League for next season fuelling a record £430 million splurge in the January transfer window .
Arsenal sits a distant sixth , six points behind their north London rivals , provoking an uncharacteristically busy window of comings and goings at the Emirates .
Top four contenders at a crossroads
Philippe Coutinho 's €160 million move to Barcelona meant Liverpool ended January in the black despite splashing out a world-record £75 million for a defender on Southampton 's Virgil van Dijk .
Despite holding their own in this season 's Champions League and domestically , Liverpool and Spurs are not even in the top 10 for net spend on transfers in the Premier League this season .
However , the steady progress achieved by both clubs under Jurgen Klopp and Mauricio Pochettino will be threatened if they miss out on next season 's Champions League , making Sunday 's clash at Anfield all the more vital .
A dominant 2-0 victory over Manchester United on Wednesday underlined Spurs ' return to form and a win at Anfield would move them ahead of their hosts in the table .
Back-to-back defeats to Swansea City and West Bromwich Albion raised questions over Liverpool 's decision not to invest in a direct replacement for Coutinho but they bounced back to see off Huddersfield 3-0 in midweek and remain unbeaten in the league at Anfield this season .
Aubameyang 's delayed debut ?
A forward line partnering new recruits Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Henrikh Mkhitaryan with Mesut Ozil , who has signed a new long-term deal , means the pessimism of a damaging 3-1 defeat at Swansea on Tuesday was quickly forgotten .
However , the Gabonese forward did not train fully on Thursday due to a fever putting his debut in doubt .
`` He had a fever so he could not practise a lot . He started yesterday , was still not completely well . I have to assess with the medical department how fit he can be , '' Wenger said .
However , with Spurs and City to follow Everton 's visit to the Emirates , Arsene Wenger will need to former Dortmund duo to quickly re-establish their partnership to keep in touch with the other challengers .
The Gunners could also quickly come to rue their winter clearout as Theo Walcott returns to the Emirates fresh from scoring twice to secure Everton 's first win of 2018 against Leicester on Wednesday .
Not so merry Mahrez
Leicester were hampered at Goodison Park by the absence of Riyad Mahrez , who reportedly handed in a transfer request due to City 's interest in a bid to force his way out of the club .
Mahrez also submitted a transfer request at the end of last season , but Foxes boss Claude Puel believes the Algerian can be cheered up in time to face Swansea on Saturday .
`` All the players and staff will help him to come back with a smile and to enjoy his football , '' said the Frenchman .
Chopping City down to size
City 's chase of Mahrez began after Leroy Sané was ruled out for at least six weeks with ankle ligament damage .
Pep Guardiola 's call for referees to protect players from dangerous challenges fell on deaf ears as Kevin De Bruyne and Brahim Diaz escaped from lunges by James McLean and Matt Phillips in Wednesday 's routine 3-0 win over West Bromwich Albion as City moved 15 points clear at the top .
`` I think , as the coach says , the referees have to do their job and if it 's a red card they have to give the red card , '' said City midfielder Bernardo Silva . `` They are not doing that over the last few months . ''
City could be in for another bruising encounter when they travel to face a Burnley side seeking their first win of the year .

An off-duty Indian-origin doctor helped deliver a healthy baby boy while on a trans-Atlantic flight from Paris to New York at 35,000 feet . Second year Cleveland Clinic resident , Dr. Hemal , helped deliver a baby while travelling back to the United States from India .
NEW YORK – An off-duty Indian-origin doctor had an “ oh boy ” story when he helped deliver a healthy baby boy while on a trans-Atlantic flight from Paris to New York at 35,000 feet , according to media reports .
Dr Sij Hemal , 27 a second-year urology resident at Cleveland Clinic 's Glickman Urological and Kidney Institute , immediately went into doctor mode when Air France flight attendants asked if there were any doctors on the flight to a 41-year-old who had gone into labour a week early , Cleveland 19 News reported .
Hemal started in New Delhi , stopped in Paris and was heading to New York , where he would catch a connecting flight to Cleveland — his final destination .
Urologist Hemal was hoping to drink a glass of champagne and take a nap on a plane from Paris to New York on December 17 , but instead helped deliver a healthy baby boy named Jake during the flight , the report said .
Together with Dr Stefanie Ortolan , a pediatrician from France , the pair managed to deliver baby Jake after just 30 minutes of pushing , Hemal said .
He did not know that she was pregnant . He said the mom 's bump was covered with a blanket .
“ As a urologist , I was excited . I thought it was kidney stones , but later found out that she was 39 weeks pregnant , ” he said .
Hemal said there was no time to land the plane and the best decision was to deliver the baby in the air . Hemal used a shoestring to tie and cut the umbilical cord for baby Jake .
“ This has been a team effort and certainly a flight I will never forget , ” he said .
“ We 're trained to stay calm and think clearly in emergency situations , ” he adds . “ I just tried to think ahead to what might go wrong , and come up with a creative solution . ”
After Jake arrived , Hemal said he FaceTimed his parents .
“ ‘ Look I 'm flying first class , ' “ he told his parents . “ I wanted to surprise them and tell them I was flying first class . I 'd never flown first class before . And … umm … by the way I also just delivered a baby ! It was one of those moments I ” ll never forget , ” he said .
For his efforts , Air France delivered a travel voucher and a bottle of champagne to Hemal .
Washington : The US Senate voted overwhelmingly on Wednesday for new sanctions punishing Russia for meddling in the 2016 US election , and to force President Donald Trump to get Congress ' approval before easing any existing sanctions . The vote was 97 to 2 for the legislation , filed as an amendment to an Iran sanctions bill .
It is intended to punish Russia over issues including alleged meddling in the election , annexation of Ukraine 's Crimea region and support for the government of Syria in that country 's six-year-long civil war . The measure sets up a process for Congress to review changes in sanctions , puts into law actions previously established via presidential executive order and imposes new sanctions on Russians found guilty of human rights abuses or conducting cyberattacks .
It was introduced amid an intense focus in the US capital on relations with Russia , and investigations by the Department of Justice and congressional committees of whether Russia sought to influence the 2016 elections to help elect Trump , and whether Trump associates colluded with Moscow as it sought to influence the election . Moscow denies any such activity , which Trump has dismissed as sour grapes by the Democrats he defeated .
The Iran bill , including the Russia sanctions amendment , was expected to pass the Senate on Thursday or later on Wednesday . To take effect , the measure would also have to pass the House of Representatives and be signed into law by Trump . If Trump objected , some of its backers said they expected enough congressional support to override a veto .
`` Today the Senate has finally confronted Russia for interfering in our elections . This bipartisan amendment is the sanctions regime that the Kremlin deserves for its actions , '' said Democratic Senator Jeanne Shaheen , a leader of the push for the legislation . The only two `` no '' votes on the Russia bill were from Republican Senators Mike Lee and Rand Paul .

`` We continue to be disturbed by reports of kidnapping , torture and murder of people in Chechnya based on their sexual orientation and those persecuted by association . ''
`` If true , this violation of human rights can not be ignored - Chechen authorities must immediately investigate these allegations , hold everyone involved accountable , and take steps to prevent future abuses . ''
`` We are against all forms of discrimination , including against people based on sexual orientation . ''
`` When left unchecked , discrimination and human rights abuses can lead to destabilization and conflict . ''
`` Tomorrow , the United States will lead the first-ever meeting on human rights in international conflicts in the U.N. Security Council to underscore our commitment to addressing human rights abuses wherever they threaten international peace and security . ''
According to reports this month , police in Chechnya have detained more than 100 people suspected of being gay .
Russian activists claim the victims are being held at a detention center near the Chechen town of Argun .
Chechnya is a predominantly Muslim region governed by Ramzan Kadyrov , who is reportedly close with Russian President Vladimir Putin .
Kadyrov 's government denied the alleged persecution .
U.S . Ambassador to the United Nations , Nikki Haley says anti-gay abuses in Chechnya ' can not be ignored'Has Nikki Haley never heard of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia ? The propaganda war against Russia continues , and what better way to poison western minds against Putin and Russia than to play the LGBT persecution card.America 's Ambassador to the United Nations Samantha Power Nikki Haley said the US will not ignore reports that authorities in the Russian republic of Chechnya are persecuting suspected gay men.Haley said in a statement on Monday ...

As the end of semester finally comes into view it is a good idea to take a breath and reflect on this past academic year before being launched into the exam period . Are you happy with where you spent your time and look forward to some much-deserved sunbathing on the beach this summer ? Or are you feeling like you were barely keeping your head above water and just ca n't wait for summer to get here ? If you are in the first group , congrats , you 've cracked the code of surviving this craziness we call university , and if you are in the second group , take some comfort in knowing you 're not alone .
A lot of students feel that trying to find balance between school , work , extracurricular , and having a social life is nearly impossible to manage . But now that most of our course work is behind us it 's a great chance to really look back and see how our last seven months played out . If you 're the type who saw your grades slip in-between parties and the Gorsebrook 's new Husky Howler maybe it 's time to map out how you could hit the books instead of the bars next year . Or if you 're the type who built a second home of study snacks and syllabi on the 3rd floor of the library , maybe it 's time to take a scroll through the contacts on your phone and catch up with some old friends .
Whatever you 've been neglecting this year , end of semester means you 're about to have a bit more ‘ me ' time in your life . What it really all comes down to is asking ourselves : what can we do to improve ?
It 's important to keep pushing ourselves to become better in our own lives , because even if we ca n't achieve perfect balance all the time , we can still work towards making our time here at SMU more enjoyable and rewarding .
The Healthy Minds Team has been working all year to try to help students become more aware of their mental wellbeing . We kicked off the year by teaching students that hard times are ‘ Better When Your Laughing ' by showing that a bit of humour can help make even the darkness moments a little brighter . We let you know there 's no topic either intense to share with others during ‘ Strength from Loss Week ' when we dove into conversations about grief , depression , and suicide .
We brought you the stress relief of a furry friend with ‘ Therapy Dogs ' throughout the school year . We talked about how different perspectives shape our experiences with events like “ Men 's Mental Health Week ' and ‘ Eating Disorders Awareness Week ' . We came together as a campus and raised money and awareness on Bell Let 's Talk day . We showcased the healing power of music at our ‘ Mental Health Coffee House ' where students could show off their amazing talents . We used all of these events and more to help you understand that there 's always something or someone here to help you get through the year .
So what can you take from this year ? That 's up to you . But if you ask us , this year has been full of amazing students and faculty who have shown our team that kindness , inclusivity , balance , and support are all things that can be achieved when we work together . We hope you have a happy summer , and of course , a healthy mind .

Chinese Women Face Rampant Gender Discrimination From Employers , Report Says
Enlarge this image toggle caption Mark Schiefelbein/AP Mark Schiefelbein/AP
China 's employers engage in blatant gender discrimination , often advertising jobs for `` men only , '' while others hire women with physical attributes aimed at appealing to their male coworkers , according to a new study published this week by Human Rights Watch .
An analysis by HRW of more than 36,000 job postings over the past five years in China found rampant gender discrimination in employment in both the state and private sectors .
`` Four decades of rapid economic growth in China have created unprecedented economic opportunities for women , but gender discrimination in employment remains widespread , '' the report , titled `` Only Men Need Apply : Gender Discrimination in Job Advertisements in China , '' says .
Human Rights Watch YouTube
In 2018 civil service job postings , 19 percent specified `` men only , '' `` men preferred '' or `` suitable for men , '' while only a single listing was found specifying a preference for a woman .
`` These job ads reflect traditional and deeply discriminatory views : that women are less physically , intellectually , and psychologically capable than men ; that women are their families ' primary sources of child care and thus unable to be fully committed to their jobs or will eventually leave full-time paid employment to have a family ; and that accommodating maternity leave is unacceptably inconvenient or costly for the company or agency , '' the report says .
In one online job recruitment video for male technicians posted by Alibaba , China 's largest internet company , the narrator says chosen candidates will work with a staff of beautiful women .
The narrator promises there are `` goddesses '' working at Alibaba who are `` smart and competent at work and charming and alluring in life . ''
`` They are independent but not proud , sensitive but not melodramatic . They want to be your coworkers . Do you want to be theirs ? '' the narrator says .
That is followed by shots of female employees of the company saying how much they love to work with tech guys . `` The most important thing is that he treats me well and that he 's handsome '' a young , female Alibaba employee manages to explain while pole dancing .
Alibaba 's recruitment social media site also posted a series of photos of several female employees , describing them as `` late night benefits '' of working for the company .
Other Chinese technology companies , such as Tencent and Baidu have also put out recruiting ads touting their female employees .
`` I mean , as a woman , of course , I felt quite disgusted , '' says Maya Wang , Human Rights Watch 's China senior researcher for Asia says .
`` I think it tells you that the problem is fairly common and widespread and quite accepted as a practice that they did n't even think twice or did n't think it would create any pushback or uproar , '' she says .
Last year , Tencent apologized for footage of an annual company outing showing female staff kneeling , appearing to use their mouths to open water bottles tucked between the legs of their male coworkers .
Tencent and Baidu have both apologized in the wake of this latest report , and Alibaba defended itself , saying that nearly half its employees are women and that women occupy a third of its management positions .
However , Wang says until China 's government starts cracking down on gender discrimination – something she says it does not do – this type of discrimination will continue .
According to the reports , `` Some women in recent years have brought successful court challenges to gender discrimination in job ads , but the compensation the companies were ordered to pay was low : in three separate court cases , the victims were each awarded 2,000 yuan ( US $ 300 ) . For many firms , such modest fines are unlikely to serve as a deterrent . ''

Bump stock ban has gun advocates fighting back against legislators
Bump stocks became wildly-known following the Las Vegas mass shooting last year .
They allow for an increased rate of fire when shooting a firearm .
Gov . Rick Scott signed a bill banning bump stocks earlier this month , and now , gun advocates are firing back .
“ We 're not filing for an injunction or asking them to prevent the law from going back , but basically what we 're saying is if you 're going to ban these items which were legal for people to buy , then they should be compensated for the loss of these items , ” said Andrew Kagan , an attorney for five clients listed in the class action lawsuit .
“ They 're just average citizens that legally purchased bump stocks that now have lost their complete value of their purchase , ” Kagan added .
Aaron Forum , the owner of Shoot Center in Cape Coral , says his store does n't sell a lot of bump stocks , but he feels like this new law will set a bad precedent .
“ The concept here is the government is basically saying , this is your personal property , it 's now illegal , and we 'll take it , and we 're not going to provide you with any compensation at all , ” Forum said .
Both Forum and Kagan say the language of the law is important for gun owners to understand .
“ They define a bump stock as a designated tool , kit , or device that allows you to fire the gun faster than you could without that tool kit or device , ” Forum said .
This means other items , like binary triggers , will also be outlawed .
“ I think maybe it warrants saying that a lot of people might own a device that increases the rate of fire and not know that it would apply in this situation , ” Forum said .
The law goes into effect in October . If you still have a bump stock with a binary trigger by then , it will be a felony .
Right now , there 's no clear-cut way to return or destroy these items , but gun experts say it 's best to go to law enforcement or a gun range .

A boy riding a motorcycle gestures as he passes a hoarding in favour of the implementation of the Goods and Services Tax ( GST ) at a street in New Delhi , India June 30 , 2017 .
NEW DELHI ( Reuters ) - Millions of companies in India are still not ready to file their first returns under the new Goods and Services Tax ( GST ) ahead of an Aug. 20 deadline , a top official told Reuters , urging them not to leave things to the eleventh hour .
Navin Kumar , chairman of the GST Network , also said barely half of the 34 service providers accredited to help firms bulk-file invoices online had received approval to go live .
Yet he gave an assurance that the huge IT back end that is designed to crunch up to 3 billion invoices a month and calculate companies ' taxes would be stable , even if there is a last-minute rush to file .
`` It will not crash , '' he told Reuters in an interview . `` We are working on the assumption that 50 percent of the people will come on the last day . ''
Billed as India 's biggest-ever tax reform , the GST has replaced a slew of federal and state levies . It has also cleared barriers between India 's 29 states , uniting its 1.3 billion people into a common market for the first time .
Yet the complexity of the tax - which has main rates of 5 , 12 , 18 and 28 percent and multiple exceptions - has raised concerns that companies will struggle to comply and file their monthly returns on time .
Even before the GST filings kick in , business surveys showed both the services and manufacturing sectors contracting at their fastest rate in years , heralding a likely dip in indirect tax revenues .

The government has allowed firms to file simplified , self-assessed GST returns by Aug. 20 for the month of July , when the tax was launched .
They will have to file complete returns in early September that itemise and reconcile every single sales invoice under a regime that , by comparison with other countries , is labour- and data-intensive .

More than 7 million existing taxpayers have activated accounts on the GST 's portal - although around a third have yet to complete the form-filling required to file a full tax return , Kumar said .
Another 1.3 million new firms have registered to pay GST .
He waved away concerns that companies would not be able to cope , saying that those used to paying value-added tax - now abolished - were used to online filing .
Although companies can upload invoices directly into the GST portal , big businesses will rely on a new breed of service provider whose applications can format , reconcile and upload invoices in bulk .
Of a first batch of 34 services providers that have been accredited , only 18 have received permission to go live . `` I have been urging them to speed up their work , '' Kumar said .
FDOT working to alleviate congestion along busy Fort Myers interchange
The Florida Department of Transportation has a new plan to ease traffic troubles in a well-traveled area of Fort Myers .
The interchange between I-75 and Corkscrew Road around Miromar Outlets gives plenty of drivers headaches . Anyone who has driven through the area knows how busy it can get . But not FDOT has a plan to fix it .
“ Well , the mornings are hard , because you get the commuter traffic off of Corkscrew , ” said driver Lily Broslovsky .
FDOT has plans to add turning lanes for people getting on the interstate to alleviate the congestion . They 'll also extend on-ramps to make it safer for drivers to merge .
But drivers are n't the only ones put in dangerous situations by the interchange . Pedestrians are also at risk .
“ As a pedestrian , sure , I worry from time to time . Someone not pays attention , texting , petting their animal in the car . That sort of thing , ” said Cory Stone .
And while people using these roads are glad to see progress , they 're skeptical about how much the project will help .
“ The roads are the way they are and to redo them would be a major project . They 've got their hands full , ” said Broslovsky .
The project is still in the design phase . On Friday , FDOT said they 're also looking at the traffic signals in the area to see if they can improve the timing so drivers get some relief in the short term .
FDOT says construction starts in the summer of 2019 and will finish by 2020 .

In 2006 , Caltech 's Paul Rothemund ( BS '94 ) —now research professor of bioengineering , computing and mathematical sciences , and computation and neural systems—developed a method to fold a long strand of DNA into a prescribed shape . The technique , dubbed DNA origami , enabled scientists to create self-assembling DNA structures that could carry any specified pattern , such as a 100-nanometer-wide smiley face .
DNA origami revolutionized the field of nanotechnology , opening up possibilities of building tiny molecular devices or “ smart ” programmable materials . However , some of these applications require much larger DNA origami structures .
Now , scientists in the laboratory of Lulu Qian , assistant professor of bioengineering at Caltech , have developed an inexpensive method by which DNA origami self-assembles into large arrays with entirely customizable patterns , creating a sort of canvas that can display any image . To demonstrate this , the team created the world 's smallest recreation of Leonardo da Vinci 's Mona Lisa—out of DNA .
The work is described in a paper appearing in the December 7 issue of the journal Nature .
While DNA is perhaps best known for encoding the genetic information of living things , the molecule is also an excellent chemical building block . A single-stranded DNA molecule is composed of smaller molecules called nucleotides—abbreviated A , T , C , and G—arranged in a string , or sequence . The nucleotides in a single-stranded DNA molecule can bond with those of another single strand to form double-stranded DNA , but the nucleotides bind only in very specific ways : an A nucleotide with a T or a C nucleotide with a G. These strict base-pairing “ rules ” make it possible to design DNA origami .
To make a single square of DNA origami , one just needs a long single strand of DNA and many shorter single strands—called staples—designed to bind to multiple designated places on the long strand . When the short staples and the long strand are combined in a test tube , the staples pull regions of the long strand together , causing it to fold over itself into the desired shape . A large DNA canvas is assembled out of many smaller square origami tiles , like putting together a puzzle . Molecules can be selectively attached to the staples in order to create a raised pattern that can be seen using atomic force microscopy .
The Caltech team developed software that can take an image such as the Mona Lisa , divide it up into small square sections , and determine the DNA sequences needed to make up those squares . Next , their challenge was to get those sections to self-assemble into a superstructure that recreates the Mona Lisa .
“ We could make each tile with unique edge staples so that they could only bind to certain other tiles and self-assemble into a unique position in the superstructure , ” explains Grigory Tikhomirov , senior postdoctoral scholar and the paper 's lead author , “ but then we would have to have hundreds of unique edges , which would be not only very difficult to design but also extremely expensive to synthesize . We wanted to only use a small number of different edge staples but still get all the tiles in the right places . ”
The key to doing this was to assemble the tiles in stages , like assembling small regions of a puzzle and then assembling those to make larger regions before finally putting the larger regions together to make the completed puzzle . Each mini puzzle utilizes the same four edges , but because these puzzles are assembled separately , there is no risk , for example , of a corner tile attaching in the wrong corner . The team has called the method “ fractal assembly ” because the same set of assembly rules is applied at different scales .
“ Once we have synthesized each individual tile , we place each one into its own test tube for a total of 64 tubes , ” says Philip Petersen , a graduate student and co-first author on the paper . “ We know exactly which tiles are in which tubes , so we know how to combine them to assemble the final product . First , we combine the contents of four particular tubes together until we get 16 two-by-two squares . Then those are combined in a certain way to get four tubes each with a four-by-four square . And then the final four tubes are combined to create one large , eight-by-eight square composed of 64 tiles . We design the edges of each tile so that we know exactly how they will combine . ”
The Qian team 's final structure was 64 times larger than the original DNA origami structure designed by Rothemund in 2006 . Remarkably , thanks to the recycling of the same edge interactions , the number of different DNA strands required for the assembly of this DNA superstructure was about the same as for Rothemund 's original origami . This should make the new method similarly affordable , according to Qian .
“ The hierarchical nature of our approach allows using only a small and constant set of unique building blocks , in this case DNA strands with unique sequences , to build structures with increasing sizes and , in principle , an unlimited number of different paintings , ” says Tikhomirov . “ This economical approach of building more with less is similar to how our bodies are built . All our cells have the same genome and are built using the same set of building blocks , such as amino acids , carbohydrates , and lipids . However , via varying gene expression , each cell uses the same building blocks to build different machinery , for example , muscle cells and cells in the retina . ”
The team also created software to enable scientists everywhere to create DNA nanostructures using fractal assembly .
“ To make our technique readily accessible to other researchers who are interested in exploring applications using micrometer-scale flat DNA nanostructures , we developed an online software tool that converts the user 's desired image to DNA strands and wet-lab protocols , ” says Qian . “ The protocol can be directly read by a liquid-handling robot to automatically mix the DNA strands together . The DNA nanostructure can be assembled effortlessly . ”
Using this online software tool and automatic liquid-handling techniques , several other patterns were designed and assembled from DNA strands , including a life-sized portrait of a bacterium and a bacterium-sized portrait of a rooster .
“ Other researchers have previously worked on attaching diverse molecules such as polymers , proteins , and nanoparticles to much smaller DNA canvases for the purpose of building electronic circuits with tiny features , fabricating advanced materials , or studying the interactions between chemicals or biomolecules , ” says Petersen . “ Our work gives them an even larger canvas to draw upon . ”
The paper is titled “ Fractal assembly of micrometre-scale DNA origami arrays with arbitrary patterns. ” The work was funded by the Burroughs Wellcome Fund , the National Institutes of Health 's National Research Service Award , and the National Science Foundation 's Expeditions in Computing program .

Rail fares have increased twice as much as pay since 2010 , according to new research ahead of news on how many prices will go up next year .
Commuters and other passengers will find out on Tuesday how much extra they will be charged from the new year .
The Government links the annual January rise in Britain 's regulated fares with the previous July 's Retail Price Index ( RPI ) measure of inflation , which will be announced by the Office for National Statistics ( ONS ) .
Regulated fares make up almost half of all tickets and include season tickets and standard returns .
They increased by 1.9 % in January , but the RPI figure for July this year is expected to be around 3.9 % , which would lead to the highest increase in fares since 2012 .
An analysis by the Rail , Maritime and Transport union ( RMT ) showed that rail fares have risen by around 32 % in eight years , while average weekly earnings have only grown by 16 % .
The rises mean for example that a new nurse or police officer commuting from Chelmsford to London , where an annual season ticket would cost £4,000 after the latest rise , would pay 20 % of their salary on an annual season ticket , said the union .
RMT general secretary Mick Cash said : `` Government policy of suppressing workers ' wages while at the same time presiding over corporate welfare on our privatised railway has resulted in a toxic combination of fare rises easily outstripping wages .
`` The private operators and government say the rises are necessary to fund investment but the reality is that they are pocketing the profits while passengers are paying more for less , with rail engineering work being delayed or cancelled , skilled railway jobs being lost and staff cut on trains , stations and at ticket offices . ''
Fewer than half ( 47 % ) of passengers are satisfied with the value for money of train tickets , according to the latest survey by passenger watchdog Transport Focus .
TUC research showed that UK commuters spend up to six times as much of their salary on rail fares as other European passengers .
As fares for passengers rise , private train companies paid out £228 million in dividends to their shareholders , while the taxpayer handed £3.2 billion to these companies last year , said the union organisation .
TUC General Secretary Frances O'Grady said : `` This is grim news for commuters , who are facing another year of fare hikes . Overcrowded and understaffed trains are costing them more and more .
`` Meanwhile it 's pay day for private rail companies , whose owners gifted themselves nearly a quarter billion in dividends last year .
`` Enough is enough . It 's time for rail services to be publicly owned , saving money for passengers and taxpayers alike . ''
Shadow transport secretary Andy McDonald said the Government `` simply ca n't justify allowing passengers to be ripped-off under privatised rail '' .
`` It is outrageous that UK commuters pay over the odds in order to subsidise travel in France , Germany , Holland and Italy and generate huge profits for private train companies , '' he said .
`` The Tories ought to be standing up for the interests of the travelling public rather than the private and foreign state-owned companies who run our railways .
`` The Retail Price Index should be scrapped as the measure for increases and replaced with the lower Consumer Price Index . ''
A Department for Transport spokesman said : `` The Government carefully monitors how rail fares and average earnings change , and keeps under review the way fare levels are calculated .
`` We are investing in the biggest rail modernisation programme for over a century to improve services for passengers - providing faster and better trains with more seats .
`` We have always fairly balanced the cost of this investment between the taxpayer and the passenger . We are driving the industry hard to improve efficiency to ensure we maximise the value of passengers ' and taxpayers ' investment in the railways .
`` Regulated rail fares are capped in line with inflation for next year . ''
Paul Plummer , chief executive of the Rail Delivery Group , said : `` Money from fares pays to run and improve the railway , making journeys better , boosting the economy , creating skilled jobs and supporting communities across Britain , and politicians set increases to season tickets .
`` It 's also the case that many major rail industry costs rise directly in line with RPI .
`` Rail companies are working together to improve performance now , adding thousands more seats over the next 18 months and , longer term , simplifying fares and ticket buying so that the country has the railway it needs to prosper . ''

The Duke of Cambridge has teamed up with pop superstar Lady Gaga to encourage people to open up about their feelings and bring an end to the `` shame '' of talking about mental health issues .
In a video watched by around 15,000 people live on Facebook , William and Lady Gaga chatted about how important speaking freely about mental health can be in helping to shatter the stigma around it .
Prince William . Picture : Heads Together/PA .
The Duke said : `` It 's time that everyone speaks up and really feels very normal about mental health , it 's the same as physical health . Everybody has mental health and we should n't be ashamed of it and just having a conversation with a friend or family member can really make such a difference . ''
William , who with his brother Harry and the Duchess of Cambridge have championed the Heads Together campaign , has has called for an end to the `` stiff upper lip '' culture , saying he wants Prince George and Princess Charlotte to be able to talk about their emotions .
It comes after Prime Minister Theresa May praised Prince Harry for his bravery in revealing that he sought counselling to come to terms with the death of his mother , Diana , Princess of Wales .
Speaking from Kensington Palace to Lady Gaga at her home in Hollywood , William told the singer many of the issues he had seen from his work with veterans , homelessness and addiction charities stemmed from mental health issues .
And he praised her bravery in revealing through an open letter last year that she lives with post-traumatic stress disorder .
Lady Gaga said her changing mental health had `` changed my life '' and she had been `` very nervous at first '' speaking about it .
She said : `` For me , waking up every day and feeling sad and going on stage is something that is very hard to describe .
`` There is a lot of shame attached to mental illness , you feel like something 's wrong with you .
`` In my life I go , 'oh my goodness , look at all these beautiful , wonderful things that I have , I should be so happy ' , but you ca n't help it if in the morning when you wake up you are so tired , you are so sad , you are so full of anxiety and the shakes that you can barely think .
`` It was like saying , 'this is a part of me and that 's OK ' . ''
Lady Gaga said talking more openly about mental health would allow people dealing with it to feel like `` we are not hiding any more '' .
She said : `` Even though it was hard , ( it was ) the best thing that could come out of my mental illness was to share it with other people and let our generation , as well as other generations , know that if you are feeling not well in your mind that you 're not alone and that people that you think would never have a problem , do .
`` We have to make the strongest , most relentless attempt we can to normalise mental health issues , so that people feel like they can come forward . ''
William added : `` It 's OK to have this conversation , it 's really important to have this conversation and that you wo n't be judged .
`` It 's so important to break open that fear and that taboo which is only going to lead to more problems down the line . ''
The pair also made plans to meet when Lady Gaga comes to the UK in October , and the singer said : `` We have to make the strongest , most relentless attempt we can to normalise mental health issues so that people feel like they can come forward . ''
Both William and Harry have been increasingly vocal about the importance of openness around mental health .
The Duke has highlighted the importance of role models speaking out their feelings , applauding grime artist Stormzy for talking about suffering from depression , and has said he and Kate want Prince George and Princess Charlotte to feel comfortable about discussing their emotions .
He told charity publication CALMzine : `` Over the past year we have visited a number of schools together where we have been amazed listening to children talk about some quite difficult subjects in a clear and emotionally articulate way , something most adults would struggle with .
`` Seeing this has really given me hope things are changing and there is a generation coming up who find it normal to talk openly about emotions . ''
William praised Stormzy 's revelation about his depression as `` incredibly powerful '' , saying : `` There may be a time and a place for the 'stiff upper lip ' , but not at the expense of your health . ''
Harry , who was 12 when his mother was killed in a car crash in Paris , has revealed that it too him until his late 20s to process his grief .
In an interview with the Daily Telegraph , Harry , 32 , said he spent nearly 20 years `` not thinking '' about her death and eventually got help after two years of `` total chaos '' .
He admitted shutting down his emotions after losing his mother had `` a quite serious effect on not only my personal life but my work as well '' , and that he eventually sought help after his brother told him he needed to deal with his feelings .
Responding to his comments , Mrs May said : `` Mental health problems affect people of all ages and all backgrounds .
`` The bravery of those in public positions who speak out about their experiences helps smash the stigma around mental health and will help thousands of people to realise they are not alone .
`` If we are to tackle this injustice , we must forge a new approach that recognises our responsibility to each other , and make mental illness an everyday concern for all of us and in every one of our institutions . ''
Ministers are thought to be considering putting NHS professionals in secondary schools full-time , under plans understood to be part of a green paper on young people and mental health which will be published later this year .
Heads Together , an umbrella organisation for mental health charities , is the London Marathon 's charity of the year , and on Tuesday William will attend a screening of BBC documentary Mind Over Marathon , which follows a group of runners affected by mental health as they prepare for the race .
The Duke and Duchess and Harry , who hope the race will be known as `` the mental health marathon '' , will hand out medals on the finish line in the Mall on Sunday .

Rahul Gandhi is in high spirits . He has reasons to be . After all , Congress has won three by-election seats in a poll-bound state . That 's quite an achievement . Plus the Sensex has crashed by 840 points a day after Arun Jaitley presented his final Budget . The Congress president was briefly silent while emerging from the Parliament after the Budget presentation ( when he possibly did n't know what to tell reporters in absence of a briefing ) but soon rediscovered his voice .
4 years gone ; still promising FARMERS a fair price .
4 years gone ; FANCY SCHEMES , with NO matching budgets .
4 years gone ; no JOBS for our YOUTH .
Thankfully , only 1 more year to go. # Budget2018 — Office of RG ( @ OfficeOfRG ) February 1 , 2018
In Parliamentary language , the Sensex just placed a solid 800 point No Confidence Motion against Modi 's budget . # BasEkAurSaal — Office of RG ( @ OfficeOfRG ) February 2 , 2018
In two tweets , Rahul took a dig at the Budget and termed the Sensex crash as a ‘ no-confidence ' motion . He also coined a hash-tag to indicate that Narendra Modi 's time is up . The attempt to cash in on middle-class angst was clear . The Congress president is making a few elementary mistakes . Let 's start with a bit of perspective .
If Sensex crashes are to be seen as ‘ no-confidence ' motions then Manmohan Singh should have resigned five times over in 2008 alone . Even a cursory look at the top five Sensex crashes show all have occurred during the UPA regime . The sixth-worst crash came in 2009 when the BSE sensitive index nosedived 870 points to close at 14,043 `` on concerns over the high fiscal deficit set by the Union Budget . '' One may find Rahul Gandhi 's trolling ironical , but sadly the Congress president is immune to ferrous jibes . Ask his designer Burberry jacket .
Conflating short-term market speculation with politics is daft . It leads to hilarious conclusions . For instance , if a single-day fall of 2.63 percent in bourses that wiped out Rs 4.6 lakh crore of investor wealth is a vote of “ no-confidence ” against Modi and his Budget , how do we explain the index 's 2000-point rise in one month ? Sensex crossed Mount 34k on 26 December and moved beyond the 35,000 mark on 17 January . If the markets were to recover the losses , will this same `` bad budget '' suddenly turn `` brilliant '' ?
Markets are driven not by any algorithm or politics , but sentiment . It is possible that punters and investors were reacting adversely to Jaitley 's reintroduction of 10 percent tax on the sale of equities if the total capital gains in a year cross Rs 1 lakh . Gains below that threshold wo n't be taxed . Gains before 31 January , 2018 would be exempted .
The move has evidently displeased Dalal Street and sparked a heated debate . Some such as Andy Mukherjee of Bloomberg feel that the move may scare away foreign investors while some feel that it is an excellent move to tap into a kitty of Rs 3.67 lakh crore which has largely accrued to corporates and LLPs . Apart from swelling the coffers in an election year , it is also a nudge towards redeployment of surpluses towards manufacturing instead of financial assets , as the finance minister put it in his speech .
The fear expressed by bourses is exaggerated . There are more compelling reasons behind the imposition of LTCG tax .
According to Taimur Baig , managing director at DBS Bank , `` By global standards , 10 percent capital gains tax is not that prohibitive ...
`` There are many countries who have had very successful capital gains regimes with significant degree of compliance and at much higher rate . It will not be a big deal at all , '' he told Boomberg Quint .
Chief investment officer of Motilal Oswal Manish Sonthalia told Boomberg Quint that `` there is a ton of cash sitting on the side , waiting to buy into every drop ... Unless there 's something really fundamentally serious , I do n't expect a steep correction . ''
V Anantha Nageswaran , an eminent economist , has praised Jaitley for bringing LTCG under the tax net , calling it a `` job well done '' to end the `` welfare state for Indian stock market investors '' .
In an earlier piece , he had called it `` bizarre and regressive '' to exempt the rich from paying taxes on long-term capital gains . He wrote in livemint : `` No respectable country that is not a financial tax haven provides this exemption for capital gains arising out of stock market investments . Capital gains are taxed everywhere ... A democratically elected government in a predominantly poor country has no reason to exempt returns to capital from tax . ''
Economist Haseeb Drabu felt that “ given the reality that money will come into equities because of the lack of alternatives , there is no reason for the government to forgo a potentially large kitty . ''
At 3.3 percent , the projected fiscal deficit is still manageable , and given India 's macroeconomic stability under NDA it possibly wo n't be long before the markets regain their composure . It could be risky for Rahul to rely on market speculation for his politics .
The Congress president 's buoyancy is based on an assumption that the middle class is angry with the prime minister . This is n't an easily quantifiable segment . The Economist reckons that `` India has a hole where its middle class should be '' in terms of purchasing power . It is varied , layered and resists easy identification . Some of them buy the latest model of iPhone while a large number of this section has never seen the inside of an airplane . `` If nearly 300m Indians count as middle class , as HSBC has proclaimed , some of them make around $ 3 a day , '' writes the newspaper .
Fluid as it is , the median is vocal , ambitious , aspiring and given India 's scale , it is not a segment that is easily ignored . The middle class wants opportunities and likes to see India remain integrated with the global economy .
Counted among Modi 's staunch backers , they were hoping for some relief by way of tax exemptions or rejig of income tax slabs from the government in an election year . Apart from a standard deduction for salaried employees which translates into a negligible rise in cash-in-hand and some allowances for senior citizens , the finance minister had precious little for this segment .
The Congress president evidently believes that all that he needs to do is to tap into this anger and Modi 's ouster is certain . He is mistaken . If Modi is ousted , that wo n't be due to the fact that the middle class has deserted him in favour of Gandhi . If their anger persists , they 'd rather vote NOTA .
BJP would n't have scraped through in Gujarat had it not been for the urban middle class who were unimpressed by Rahul 's Gabbar Singh Tax jibe . The incumbents faced massive erosion in rural voter base , an area where Modi concentrated the most in his Budget . Some may say this is good politics .
Rahul 's optimism is misplaced because the middle class suffers from a historical , deep , indelible cynicism when it comes to the Congress , especially the Gandhis . For decades post Independence this self-made class built its life carefully around the regressive policy frameworks of 1970s and 80s and carried on with their austere lifestyle with a degree of stoicism .
Not until PV Narasimha Rao 's economic liberalisation that this segment witnessed some prosperity . Rao , an outlier in Congress , opened the windows , which were further widened by Atal Bihari Vajpayee . The 10 UPA years have served to only confirm the middle class 's lack of confidence in Congress .
There 's one more reason why Rahul might be misreading middle class anger against Modi . Unlike the stoicism of the past , the middle class is now more invested in the government . It is restive , responsive , vocal , even loud . In social media , it has a platform to vent its spleen . Modi has been a pioneer in harnessing the power of social media to connect with his electorate . This relationship goes deep .
Their displeasure with Modi is evident but they also recognise that his government at least stands for something . It is willing to take risks instead of sitting on the fence , even at the cost of antagonising own voter base . It has implemented disruptive policy decisions with all the finesse of a mace but has n't been guilty of inaction . The aspirational middle class understands this .
This anger , therefore , is sharp but might not be a bankable commodity for a politician who comes across as insincere , ready to hunt with the hound and run with the hare . Rahul should n't bet on it .
Statistics Finland reported on Thursday that the country 's working-day adjusted gross domestic product increased by 3.0 per cent year-on-year in February , representing already the second consecutive month with a growth rate of at least three per cent .
Economists have estimated that the economy and growth statistics published ahead of last weekend are an indication of better times to come for Finland .
Revised data indicate that working-day adjusted output increased by 3.7 per cent from the previous year in January .
“ The growth rate has exceeded three per cent already for a few months in succession and could continue doing so judging by confidence indicators . The impossible is becoming possible , ” rejoiced Reijo Heiskanen , the chief economist at OP Financial Group .
The financial services provider has forecast that the national economy will expand by 1.8 per cent in 2017 . The Bank of Finland , in turn , recently raised its growth forecast for the year from 1.3 to 1.6 per cent .
Pasi Kuoppamäki , the chief economist at Danske Bank , is similarly optimistic that the growth rate will continue to exceed expectations in the months to come . “ The three per cent growth rate can be sustained in 2017 , barring any severe fluctuations . It would allow us to cut down the substantial lead of Sweden , ” he tweeted on Thursday .

Hyderabad - Pakistan People 's Party Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari has said that PPP is contesting elections on the basis of ideology and the peoples ' welfare policies instead of winning or losing the general elections .
On his second day of countrywide election campaign , Bilawal visited top PPP leaders ' constituencies in Hyderabad , Matiari , Hala , Shahdadpur , Sanghar and Nawabshah districts of the province .
Addressing a press conference and PPP supporters at party camps in Latifabad and Qasimabad areas of the city on Tuesday , he said he was not only taking responsibility for the PPP election campaign but also carrying stick in order to ensure implementation on promises made by elected representatives .
Bilawal did not rule out installation of a coalition government in federation after general elections . The PPP chairman said that all institutions should work within the constitutional framework .
Bilawal visited former provincial ministers Jam Khan Shoro and Sharjeel Inam Memon constituencies in Hyderabad , Makhdoom family constituencies in Matiari and Hala and Shazia Marri constituency in Sanghar .
Bilawal began his journey in Hyderabad from the residence of former federal Minister Naveed Qamar .
A large number of people welcomed him and chanted slogans in his favour .
He said that he had come out for the first time and being the son of the martyred mother - Benazir Bhutto - he would take responsibility of PPP election campaign and those elected into power .
“ Along with responsibility , I am also raising the stick and if the elected representatives would not resolve your issues then I will resolve them , ” he said , adding , he was there to fulfill the unaccomplished mission of Benazir Bhutto and as people did not leave his grandfather Bhutto and mother Benazir , they would also not leave him .
He also addressed a public gathering in Rahuki , organised by the former Sindh Information minister Sharjeel Memon , at his farm house .
Bilawal said that PPP was the only party that had an ideology and manifesto and likewise Bhutto and Benazir served the masses , he should also be given a chance to serve the masses .
He said that earlier they came with a mission to eradicate poverty but this time their mission was to eradicate hunger .
“ We would be establishing food centres at union councils which would be run by women , ” he said .
“ Likewise , we gave Benazir Income Support Programme , this time after coming into power , we will give Benazir Kisaan Card which will provide interest-free loans and insurance in case of damage to the fields to farmers . ”
“ Our manifesto is people , labour and farmer-friendly , ” he said .
He said their struggle would not be easy and even today there was injustice in the country and two parallel systems were in place . “ Dual systems of justice are in place for PPP and other people , ” he said .
“ We call for rule of law and accountability and PPP be made accountable and they are not against it but they should also be allowed to defend themselves .
“ Until and unless we do not have one system , we can not move the country forward , ” he added .
He , however , admitted that a lot of work needed to be done in water sector which included the establishment of de-salinity plants to ensure availability of water to the people . There is the need that the federal government should provide due right and resources to Sindh for completion of development projects , he added .
He said unprecedented uplift work was done during Qaim Ali Shah and Murad Ali Shah 's tenures .
He also raised the slogans ‘ Neither Mirs nor Pirs , the vote is for Benazir . '
Bilawal termed the Grand Democratic Alliance in Sindh a puppet alliance which had no support in the masses . “ Those who are making hue and cry over water shortage in Sindh are responsible for signing 1991 Water Accord . They felt no guilt of supporting the dictators for construction of dam in the past , he replied to a question .
The PPP chairman was given a warm welcome at Shahdadpur where thousands of PPP activists including the supporters of PPP Senator Imamuddin Shauqeen-who switched loyalties from PML-F to PPP , received him .
The supporters who were queued in line showered the PPP chairman - who was travelling on a bomb-proof truck - with rose petals .
Last month , the Korean band Say Sue Me introduced us to their sophomore album Where We Were Together by way of its lead single “ Old Town. ” It was a sneakily but feverishly infectious bit of indie-pop , utilizing a brisk surf-rock guitar to propel a track that actually bore a pretty ruminative narrative about getting older and the relationships we maintain to the places we 're from . All of which is to say : If “ Old Town ” was anything to go by , Say Sue Me 's a forthcoming LP was something to start getting excited about .
The group started to make good on that promise with the simmering “ B Lover , ” and now they 're back with another new one called “ After Falling Asleep. ” Compared to its predecessors , “ After Falling Asleep ” takes place in a more amorphous zone , with elements that recall shoegaze and dream-pop . It also departs from Say Sue Me 's work otherwise due to the fact that frontwoman Sumi Choi sings in Korean this time around .
Even if you do n't speak Korean , the mood of “ After Falling Asleep ” is evocative as is — you can hear Choi 's meaning in it without totally grasping it , which is appropriate enough for a shoegaze-tinged composition . Speaking to Billboard , Choi did explain the inspiration behind it : “ It 's about when I go to sleep and then I felt like I could be another person. ” The resulting song is drenched in wistfulness , with Choi adding “ At the end , I do n't want to be outside of the dream. ” Check it out below .

Russian Ambassador to Ankara Aleksey Yerhov stated that the Sochi congress which was held on Jan. 29-30 was a victory .
Speaking to Daily Sabah , the ambassador noted that the congress is a victory for the guarantor states of Astana process - Turkey , Russia and Iran - and he accepted that some problems occurred during the congress . He said , `` There were , of course , some minor problems , we accept this . But it is a natural process . No one expected that it would be perfect . But it is important that the congress took place and was successful . All sides , including Turkey and Iran , share the same point of view . `` Touching upon the Syrian opposition 's return to Turkey due to the Syrian regime 's flags and logos at the Sochi airport and congress hall , the Russian Ambassador noted that the congress was held together for the first time and that it is normal to see some problems . Ambassador Yerhov underlined that owing to the efforts of Turkish partners the negative effect was smoothed . `` It is important that one should be wise enough not to dwell on a little thing ; we must keep focused to be able to achieve a big result . We will take into account the flags and logo issue and take the necessary steps to prevent such issues , '' added the ambassador .
Referring to the THKP-C terrorist organization 's leader Mihraç Ural , who is responsible in the terrorist attack in Turkey 's Reyhanlı in 2013 , the ambassador said that he could n't understand how it turned out that Ural was present at the Congress . `` It is true that he was not on the list that was decided by Turkey , Iran and Russia . Now , the competent authorities in Russia are investigating how he arrived there and we will inform our Turkish partners regarding the incident once we obtain enough information , '' added the ambassador . He also noted that such an incident will not harm the mutual steps taken by Russia and Turkey .
The summit - backed by Turkey , Russia , and Iran - was held in the Russian Black Sea city of Sochi on Jan. 29-30 . It was an attempt to bring all warring parties in the Syrian conflict , excluding the terrorist groups , to the table to facilitate the U.N.-sponsored peace talks in Geneva .
A proposal to form a constitutional committee was agreed upon on Monday by the representatives from the Syrian regime and the guarantor countries of Russia , Iran and Turkey .
Parties at the two-day summit also said in a final statement that they want to bring an end to the ongoing conflict as soon as possible , and urged international help towards that end .
President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and President Vladimir Putin also hailed the decision at Sochi to form a constitutional committee as its `` most important outcome , '' asserting that the progress made at the meeting enhances both the Astana and Geneva peace talks and U.N. Security Council resolutions .
Rebecca DeMont could n't believe her luck when she was at the hairdresser . Her stylist rolled up the coffee rim on her Tim Hortons cup for her . It said : “ Win Civic . ”
DeMont did n't believe she had won a new Honda Civic at first .
“ She said : ‘ No you won a car , ' ” said DeMont , who , like most people , only had ever won a free coffee or donut in Tim Hortons popular Roll Up the Rim contest . “ It was awesome . I 've never won anything this big before . ”
As luck would have it , she was in the market for a new vehicle anyway , so the win could n't have come at a better time .
Her husband had just paid off his vehicle , and since the couple both work , a month before the win , they began talking about purchasing a second vehicle to make their lives a little easier .
Connie Grant , who owns the Tim Hortons restaurants in Cold Lake , as well as Wainwright , said she ca n't remember anyone in the local area ever winning a car before .
Fifty 2018 Honda Civic Sedan EX-T vehicles were to be given away across Canada this year as part of the Roll Up the Rim contest .
KABUL : - There is no military solution to the conflict in Afghanistan that is forcing record numbers of people from their homes , United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres said on Wednesday , during an unannounced visit to the war-torn country . Guterres ' first visit as secretary general comes as the Afghan government faces internal turmoil , insurgents make gains nationwide and the international military coalition mulls plans to send thousands more troops to help to struggle Afghan forces.–Agencies
These combined threats have worsened the crisis for refugees and internally displaced people , forcing international bodies like the United Nations to call for emergency funding .
The crisis can only be solved by ending the war , said Guterres , standing in a makeshift camp on the outskirts of Kabul that accommodates Afghans displaced by fighting . `` Peace is the solution for the problem , '' said Guterres , previously a United Nations ' high commissioner for refugees . At least 126,000 Afghans have been forced to flee their homes , the United Nations says .
More than 218,000 Afghan refugees have also returned this year from neighboring Iran and Pakistan , many citing pressure from authorities there .
The International Organization for Migration estimates that at least 600,000 refugees could return this year , piling strain on aid groups struggling to help the newly displaced .
Khumri , a 30-year-old Afghan woman who met Guterres , said she had lived in the squalid camp for the last two years with her family after their home was destroyed and her husband killed by government forces battling Taliban occupying their village in the northeastern province of Kapisa .
`` We need everything , '' she said , recounting the struggle for clean water , food , and hygiene materials that drives some to beg . Guterres was set to meet Afghan President Ashraf Ghani , who is trying to soothe domestic political tension after recent violence in the capital , Kabul . Ghani also hosted international delegations last week in a bid to set the stage for peace negotiations with the Taliban , which have remained stalled amid widespread fighting .
If the Taliban do not begin negotiations soon , Ghani will seek new UN sanctions against the group as a sponsor of terrorism , he told the June 6 meeting .
Any sanctions would be up to the UN Security Council , Guterres said . Afghanistan has endured too many `` foreign interventions '' , however , he added , urging an eventual deal to resolve the war .
Thousands of international troops remain in Afghanistan to train and assist Afghan forces , besides mounting counterterrorism operations .

LONDON - M Abbas was the best of the lot in an outstanding Pakistan bowling attack in the first Test against England at Lord 's , a line-up that shot the home side out for 184 and 242 to set up a nine-wicket win .
Abbas returned 4/23 and 4/41 to win the Player of the Match award , but was a bit disappointed at missing out on a five-wicket haul even though it helped him enter the top 20 of the MRF Tyres ICC Test Rankings for bowlers .
“ Very happy . My first match at Lord 's , and to get the Player of the Match award … my aim was to pick up five wickets and get my name in the Honours Board , but it did n't happen in either innings . But by the grace of Allah , I did get eight wickets , ” said Abbas . “ It was the first time I played in front of such a big crowd , and I enjoyed myself a lot . ”
Abbas , 28 , sent back both Alastair Cook and Joe Root in the England second innings after Pakistan had taken a 179-run lead following the first-innings exchanges , and that gave him great pleasure .
“ The wickets of Alastair Cook and Joe Root made me very happy … I had it in my mind that in this series I wanted to get the big players out , that 's always my aim . I 'm glad I was successful in that , ” he said .
Not many bowlers from the subcontinent arrive in England , at Lord 's especially , and adjust so well to the famous slope at the storied venue , but Abbas did n't have any problems , and pointed to his time with Leicestershire for being Lord's-ready .
“ I have to thank the PCB [ Pakistan Cricket Board ] and the team management for giving me the permission to come and play for Leicestershire before the series . I trained at Leicester , and there 's a slope there too , like most other grounds here . You have to adjust , ” said Abbas about his time at Grace Road in April .
He was also gushing in his praise for Azhar Mahmood , the Pakistan bowling coach . “ Azhar bhai treats us like younger brothers . He keeps things cheerful and lively , and that 's a big plus , ” said Abbas . “ Even when he was in Pakistan , I used to stay in touch with him over WhatsApp and ask him questions . That has helped a lot , and now I have performed in Malahide [ 4/44 and 5/66 in the Test against Ireland ] and here . ”
While Mahmood has been helping Abbas since he came into the Pakistan team , the Sialkot man says he has learnt most things he knows by watching Glenn McGrath and Mohammad Asif .
“ My idols are Asif bhai and Glenn McGrath . I try to bowl like them , and I watch their bowling . I have played with Asif bhai too , in domestic cricket for Sialkot . I have spoken to him a lot . I try to bowl line and length like he does . I have also consulted him on my grips , ” said Abbas .
“ I have watched a lot of his [ McGrath 's ] videos . He has bowled so much , so many long spells , and I have followed those videos . I have bowled many long spells in domestic cricket , and whether as a batsman or as a bowler , when you play a lot , you know what your strengths are . You know what you have , and that has given me success . ”
And just in case his heroics at Lord 's made one aware of the seven-Test-old paceman , Abbas is quick to point to his numbers : 40 wickets at an average of 16.62 and a strike rate of 40.8 including two five-wicket innings hauls , in matches played in the Caribbean , the United Arab Emirates , and now in Ireland and England . He is certainly the latest in a long line of superbly talented Pakistani pacemen all right .
Housing societies in Mumbai that are n't segregating their wet and dry garbage may be in for a rude shock , with the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation ( BMC ) initiating stringent punitive measures against them . The civic body has said it will cut power and water supply to errant societies , following up on a threat it issued last year .
As reported by The Indian Express , the BMC will not only disconnect electricity and water supply but it will also initiate legal action against housing societies found not segregating their garbage . The report said the civic body will also write to the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board ( MPCB ) , demanding action against errant complexes .
A senior official from the solid waste management department of the BMC said that it is mandatory for all projects constructed since 2007 to erect facilities such as composting units . However , many of the projects are n't doing so , instead using space demarcated for this purpose as a parking lot or as a garden , he said .
`` These societies , which had 'intent of disapproval ' under the waste management rule , were supposed to treat waste within their premises . The rule proposes action such as disconnection of water and electricity . However , this can be done only after taking the MPCB 's consent . Hence , we are writing to them , '' a senior official from the SWM department said .
A report in The Times of India in October 2017 quoted BMC commissioner Ajoy Mehta as saying the rule will be applicable only to bulk generators of garbage . Bulk generators are defined as societies with a built-up area of 20,000 square metres and more , and those which generate 100 kilograms of wet waste a day .
The BMC had also announced it would stop lifting waste from bulk generators from October , which was later extended by four months . `` The BMC is holding exhibitions , meeting housing societies to understand their problems in case they are not able to process their waste and also considering central segregation centres for societies that do not have the space . After chalking everything out , we expect people 's participation , '' Mehta had said .
But with repeated extensions also failing to achieve the desired target , the BMC has finally run out of patience .

London : Madison Keys may possess one of the biggest games in women 's tennis , but she admits that the power-packed men 's game at Wimbledon leaves her cold .
The 10th seeded American made the third round with a 6-4 , 6-3 win over Thailand 's Luksika Kumkhum on Wednesday .
So far , the 23-year-old 's serve has been clocked at 115 mph ( 185km/h ) , seventh fastest in the women 's singles with Venus Williams leading the way on 123mph ( 197km/h ) .
They are a long way behind Milos Raonic , the serve king of the men 's event , who hit a top speed of 147 mph ( 236.5km/h ) on Wednesday . The Canadian has also fired 52 aces in three rounds .
However , they are the kind of statistics which do n't impress Keys .
`` I 'm going to be totally honest with you . I find it kind of boring , sorry , '' she said .
`` Just because it seems like they just hit like 312 aces a match , and , I 'm , like , Wow that 's a good serve . It 's like 7-6 in the fifth and it 's been like an hour and a half ! ''
Keys , the runner-up to close friend Sloane Stephens at the US Open last year , made the quarter-finals at Wimbledon in 2015 but was knocked out in the second round last year by Simona Halep .
That roller-coaster on grass sums up her relationship with a surface which fills just over a month of the tennis season between the European clay court swing and the US hard-court series .
Keys first played on a grass court as a 16-year-old at the Maureen Connolly Cup in Eastbourne before competing at junior Wimbledon .
`` Everyone had told me I was going to love it and all that , '' she said .
`` But it definitely took some getting used to and I 'm pretty sure I fell a lot the first couple times I was hitting on it . ''
She is now just one of eight active women players to have won multiple grass court titles , at Eastbourne in 2014 and Birmingham two years later .
Outside of the Williams sisters , who have 12 Wimbledon titles between them , Keys is viewed as the next likely US champion at the England Club .
`` I think the biggest thing about grass is the bounce is just completely different , '' said the powerful 5ft 10in ( 1.77m ) player .
`` You go from it being on clay where it usually is bouncing higher , and then all of a sudden the ball does n't come up at all and you have to be a lot lower .
`` It makes my legs a lot more sore . And I usually have my coach in my ear telling me to get lower a lot more pretty much after every ball . ''
At the annual meeting of the National Music Publishers Association on Wednesday , Yoko and Sean Ono Lennon received the organization 's new Centennial Song award for John Lennon 's legendary 1971 song “ Imagine ” — and Yoko received more than that . NMPA CEO David Israelite showed a video from 1980 wherein John said that Yoko deserved a songwriting credit for “ Imagine ” because of her influence and inspiration on it — and Israelite announced that in accordance with Lennon 's wish , Yoko will be added to the song as a co-writer .
Cornered by Variety after the event , Israelite confirmed that the process to add Yoko 's credit , while not yet confirmed , is already under way . He noted that there may be some opposition to the move at some point along the way — a song enters the public domain 70 years after its creator 's ( or creators ' ) death and Yoko , now 84 , is still alive , thus significantly extending the number of years that the song will generate income for its writers . But he said that the NMPA and Downtown Music Publishing , which administers both Ono 's and Lennon 's solo compositions , are hopeful that it will be confirmed . Justin Kalifowitz , CEO of Downtown , had not responded to Variety 's request for comment as this article published .
At the ceremony , Yoko took the stage to accept her award in a wheelchair , pushed by Sean . While her words were partially obscured both by her accent and the echo from room 's high ceilings , she spoke briefly about how her illness — she is suffering from an unclear flu-like ailment — has made her appreciate the song and other elements of life more fully , and said “ This is the best time of my life , ” to applause . She continued , “ And I am so surprised that Sean created his own vision — “ but then Sean , whose long hair , beard , fedora and dark suit made him look startlingly like his father circa 1969 , gently took the microphone and said , charmingly , “ Let 's not talk about me ! , ” to laughter . He spoke briefly about the importance of music education in schools , and how much his father learned at art college . “ So let 's not let any generation be denied the opportunity of letting those parts of their imaginations [ thrive ] . ”
An emotional Patti Smith , accompanied on piano by her daughter Jessie , then performed the song , mixing up the lyrics a little and pausing at times to compose herself .
Because Ono is a beneficiary of Lennon 's estate , the move is not as complicated financially as it might have been been she not . However , virtually everything involving The Beatles and the vast fortune they generated has many ramifications , so more legal maneuvering is likely in the months and years to come .

A few months ago , I wrote a piece about how my bicycle was stolen from outside my apartment in Brooklyn . It went viral .
In short , the story is this : I painted a huge sign and left it for the thief . My doorbell rang several times over the next few days with different people trying to help me , including some kids who gave me a kids bike , a woman who gave me a hug and an art dealer who bought my painted sign for $ 200 — the value of my bike . Ultimately , it was a story about humanity . It even had a hashtag , # KarmaCycle .
After my essay was published in The Washington Post , the worldwide media attention came quickly . For a girl who grew up watching Carson Daly on MTV in the mid-90s , hearing him say my name on the `` Today '' show was a big deal . But as a woman who regularly hears the phrase `` fake news '' thrown around , I got a firsthand look . While most news outlets got it right , some got it wrong .
My story was twisted by a few places , including a slide show that aired of a painter ( supposedly me ; I am not a painter ) getting assaulted by a robber ( what ? ) while riding her bike . It was in Spanish .
The mistakes were entertaining , but the essence of the story remained : It was about inspired strangers working within their means to help each other . Back in Brooklyn , I felt the need to bring the goodwill story full circle .
To begin with , I had a kid 's bike to give away , given to me by Stranger # 1 . I called dozens of local elementary and middle schools asking if they knew a kid who needed a bike . Some people were skeptical . Why are you giving away a bike ? What 's wrong with it ? Others thought it was great , but could n't fathom what to do with it . How should we decide who deserves it ? Do you have one for everyone ?
Doing good was going to be harder than I thought .
Then there was the question of the $ 200 from Stranger # 3 . I wanted to buy a bike , but I did n't want the bucks to ( literally ) stop with me . I do n't consider myself a biker ( no clip-ins or padded spandex here ) , but I love biking in New York City , and I 'm shocked at how many of my friends do n't have bikes .
I 'm a video producer , so I decided to make a short film about my bike hunt to expose people to some of NYC 's bike resources — and to have a little fun .
That 's when CitiBike called .
( Reuters ) - Manchester United manager Jose Mourinho believes centre back Eric Bailly and striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic could return from injury to play in the Champions League this month .
Bailly had ankle surgery in December after sustaining an injury while on international duty with the Ivory Coast .
Ibrahimovic , the club 's top scorer last season with 28 goals , made a comeback in November from a long-term knee injury , but suffered a setback and has not featured since a 45-minute cameo against Burnley in the Premier League last December .
Mourinho expects the pair to return for the last-16 Champions League tie against Sevilla , with the first-leg in Spain on Feb. 21 .
“ They are working on the pitch but not yet with us as a group so they are not very close to a return , ” he told a news conference on Friday .
“ I want to believe that by Champions League time , around the end of the month , they will be back . ”
Marouane Fellaini continues to struggle with a knee injury and the Portuguese manager confirmed the midfielder will remain on the sidelines for Saturday 's league clash against Huddersfield Town .
The 30-year-old Belgian limped out only seven minutes after coming on as a second-half substitute in United 's 2-0 league defeat at Tottenham Hotspur on Wednesday .
“ It 's not an ACL ( anterior cruciate ligament ) , it 's not a complete rupture of any structure of the knee , so we are not going as far as that . But we are probably going to lose him for a few weeks , but I can not say how long at the moment , ” Mourinho said .
Heading into the weekend , Mourinho has conceded the title to runaway leaders Manchester City for the first time , adding United must now strive to be “ first of the last ” this season .
United are in second place , 15 points behind City with 13 matches left .
“ The game is important because we need points to be the first of the last . We have to try to finish second , ” he said .
“ We are better than last season in every aspect -- points , position , number of goals scored , conceded -- so we have to try to stay there . ”
Ciani 's goal , which gave the Galaxy a 1-0 lead in the 33rd minute , came two minutes after Schmid pulled his starters inserting , among others , 15-year-old academy product Efrain Alvarez . On the play , Lletget bent a long right-footed pass to the edge of the six-yard box for Ciani , who headed it toward the far post . Salt Lake keeper Nick Rimando got a hand on the shot , but not enough to keep it out of the net .

It said it was not in discussion with Liberty Global regarding a merger of the two firms .
“ Vodafone confirms that it is in early stage discussions with Liberty Global regarding the potential acquisition of certain overlapping continental European assets owned by Liberty Global , ” the company said .
The Financial Times earlier on Friday said the two were in talks about swapping assets in Europe .
Shares in Vodafone closed up 2.4 percent at 219.5 pence a share . Liberty Global rose to more than two-years highs in new York and was up 2.9 percent at $ 38.28 in afternoon trading .
Liberty Global noted Vodafone 's statement and had no further comment , a spokesman said .
The world 's second biggest mobile operator and the cable company discussed swapping assets in 2015 , but they could not reach agreement on values .
The two , however , did agree the following year to form a joint venture in the Netherlands , VodafoneZiggo , bringing together mobile , broadband and TV services in a package designed to compete more effectively with former state monopoly KPN .
Analysts have said that a more wide-ranging tie-up between the two would be the logical next step for both companies .
Vodafone Chief Executive Vittorio Colao has spoken favorably about doing further deals with Liberty , saying in November 2016 that the two could be a counter force to Deutsche Telekom .
Malone , whose Liberty Global is largely funded by debt , said last year that Liberty and Vodafone could not agree on values in the previous talks , but “ the door was always open ” to the British company .
Vodafone and Liberty also have overlapping operations in the Czech Republic , Hungary and Romania in continental Europe , as well as in two countries excluded from the talks , namely Britain and Ireland .
But Germany is by far the biggest continental market where Liberty 's assets would help Vodafone to take on the former incumbent , Deutsche Telekom , with bigger packages of converged services .
Vodafone has a mobile market share of 26.1 percent by revenue in Germany , putting it second behind Deutsche Telekom with 30.3 percent , according to the Federal Network Regulator 's latest annual report .
Deutsche Telekom leads the broadband market , with 13 million customers in Germany and a 40.1 percent market share . Vodafone is second on 19.7 percent , and Liberty 's Unitymedia fourth at 10.5 percent , according to the VATM industry lobby .
A combination in Germany also stacks up geographically . Unitymedia is in the western German states of North Rhine-Westphalia , Hesse and Baden-Wuerttemberg , while Vodafone broadband is available in Germany 's other 13 federal states , meaning there is no overlap between the two .
Unitymedia reported revenue of $ 703.1 million in the quarter to end-September 2017 , 18 percent of Liberty 's European revenue , and operating cash flow of $ 444.6 million , 24 percent of the group total .
The Patriots open the final quarter of the regular season without their very talented and important tight end . But they 're getting another weapon back .
Barring a pregame setback , Chris Hogan ( shoulder ) will be active for New England 's Monday Night Football , NFL Network 's Tom Pelissero reported on Monday . Hogan has missed the last four games due to injury .
As is typical for the franchise , New England has n't missed a beat in Hogan 's absence , but his return is especially welcome as Rob Gronkowski spends this week in street clothes . Hogan recorded 33 catches for 438 yards and five touchdowns in New England 's first eight games , and offers Tom Brady another option in a receiving corps that has long been without Julian Edelman .
Elsewhere in injury news on Monday :
1 . Philadelphia Eagles coach Doug Pederson announced on Monday that quarterback Carson Wentz suffered a knee injury in Sunday 's win over the Los Angeles Rams .
2 . Los Angeles Rams corner Kayvon Webster suffered a torn Achilles in their loss to the Eagles on Sunday , coach Sean McVay said after the game .
3 . Buffalo Bills coach Sean McDermott said it 's too early to tell the severity of receiver Kelvin Benjamin 's knee injury , per the team 's official site .
4 . Green Bay Packers cornerback Davon House suffered a transverse process fracture in his back , NFL Network Insider Ian Rapoport reports .
5 . Todd Bowles said New York Jets quarterback Josh McCown broke his hand in Sunday 's loss to Denver . McCown will be out for the rest of the season and will undergo surgery .
6 . New Orleans Saints running back Alvin Kamara ( concussion ) said he expects to be good to go for next Sunday against the Jets , per The Times-Picayune .

Without question , the 1990s were full of some fantastic cartoons . The expansion of original programming on cable channels like Nickelodeon , the Disney Channel , and Cartoon Network ( and the subsequent competition among all kids-oriented programming blocs ) led to a new era of creativity , and animation that started evolving away from the previously ubiquitous Hanna-Barbera style . But what were some of the very best of the best ? We at Collider dug into our mind palaces of TV nostalgia to come up with the following list of beloved 90s series , and divided up the results . But first , here 's a look at our methodology :
TV shows had to premiere between 1990-1999 , and be aimed at a kid-friendly audience ( which precludes Beavis and Butt-Head , SouthPark , The PJ 's , etc — look for them to be included in future lists ) .
, , , etc — look for them to be included in future lists ) . The shows chosen are ones we both liked and found to be significant in some way to the 90s canon of kids animated TV .
But , because of our general ages , there is some bias towards the early 90s ( sorry , SpongeBob ! )
! ) The following list is not ranked in any particular order .
Check out our choices below , and enjoy singing ( or humming or reciting ) along to the theme tunes for each — we know you know them ! ( some of which are hilariously bad versions thanks to apparently super vigilant copyright police ) . Also , do n't forget to add your additional picks , favorites , and memories in the comments .

Police were investigating whether the child , Bismah Babar , a resident of Sheesh Mahal Ghati in Bhati Gate , was killed after sexual assault . A policeman said the body bore torture marks . “ There were severe torture marks on the body . It seems the child was strangled with a wire or something like that , ” the official said on anonymity . Later , police registered a murder case against unidentified people on the complaint of the deceased 's father .
Bismah was playing in the street when she went missing , according to her family .
Her relatives launched a search in the area as the child did not turn up for hours . They called the police by phone as they witnessed her body on the neighbours ' roof . The body was moved to the morgue for autopsy .
Forensic experts also visited the crime scene to collect evidences .

The pilot and the passenger , a friend who was previously a student pilot but never completed his training , were making their first flight together .
The pilot , who sustained serious injuries , did not recall the accident .
The passenger reported that the pilot took off from the departure airport and then transferred the controls to him and let him fly for a while . They flew to another airport , and the pilot made one touch-and-go landing on Runway 36 .
During departure , the pilot again transferred control to the passenger and stated , “ you make the next landing and I will watch you . ”
The passenger reported that he was trying to fly the Piper PA-28 straight to the runway but drifting left due to a quartering tailwind , which was reported as 14 knots , gusting to 22 knots . The passenger tried to correct the flight path but was unable to align the airplane with the runway centerline .
He did not remember if the pilot tried to help at any point before the airplane hit the ground near Homestead , Florida .
The airplane came to rest near midfield and about 340′ left of the runway edge .
Examination of the wreckage did not reveal evidence of any preimpact mechanical malfunctions that would have precluded normal operation .
The pilot 's ( left front seat 's ) shoulder harness was torn in half at its midpoint . The distal 24″ ( the portion that did not normally retract into the inertia reel ) of the webbing showed significant discoloration , fading , and stiffness . A significant section of abrasive wear was noted on the edges of the webbing about 15 to 21″ from the distal end fitting . The shoulder harness separated in this worn section .
The passenger 's ( right front seat 's ) shoulder harness was also discolored , faded , and stiff .
The manufacturer 's maintenance manual for the airplane stated that an inspection of the seat belts is required during the annual and/or 100-hour inspection . The manual indicated that the belts are to be replaced if deteriorated or worn .
Review of the airplane 's maintenance logbooks found no records indicating that the seat belts were ever inspected or replaced . If the pilot 's shoulder harness had been replaced , it would likely have secured him in his seat and minimized the severity of the injuries that he incurred .
Probable cause : The pilot 's improper decision to allow the passenger to attempt a landing , which resulted in a loss of control during landing with a quartering tailwind . Contributing to the severity of the pilot 's injuries was the separation of the deteriorated shoulder harness .

Turkish authorities are starting to uncover evidence about a gun attack on an Istanbul nightclub which killed 39 people on Sunday but there is no clarity yet on who was responsible , Turkish Prime Minister Binali Yildirim said .
`` Some details have started emerging , but the authorities are working towards a concrete result , '' Yildirim told reporters , when asked about who might have been behind the attack .
`` Police and security officials will share information as it becomes available during the investigation , '' he said .
For weeks , it has sometimes seemed that the only thing people in Washington were talking about was a classified memo that almost no one was actually allowed to read .
Now that it 's public , it 's time to break down what this controversial document is all about .
Where did the memo come from ?
The memo was written by staff working for Rep. Devin Nunes ( R-Tulare ) , who chairs the House Intelligence Committee and is one of President Trump 's closest allies in Congress . With the support of House Speaker Paul D. Ryan ( R-Wis. ) , Nunes spent months demanding sensitive records from the FBI and the Justice Department , including the highly classified evidence used to support a warrant application to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court . The Nunes team then wrote a four-page memo summarizing what they thought were the most important problems with the process . Democrats on the committee did not have any input into the report , nor did many of Nunes ' Republican colleagues .
Los Angeles Times
What does this have to do with the Russia investigation ?
Not much . The memo focuses on government surveillance , approved by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court , of Carter Page , who served as a foreign policy advisor to the Trump campaign . The first application for a warrant came in October 2016 , after Page had left the campaign amid questions about his contacts with Russian officials . Page has not been charged with a crime , and has accused the government of improperly eavesdropping on him .
But the memo confirms that another Trump aide , George Papadopoulos , “ triggered the opening ” of the investigation that is now headed by special counsel Robert S. Mueller III into whether Trump or his aides assisted Russian meddling in the election . Papadopoulos reportedly confided to an Australian diplomat in July 2016 that Russian intelligence officials had obtained Democratic Party emails , and the diplomat passed the warning to the FBI . Papadopoulos pleaded guilty last October to lying to the FBI about his contacts with Russian officials and is cooperating with Mueller 's team .

April 6 , 2017 Nunes steps aside from leading his committee 's Russia investigation amid an ethics controversy over whether he inappropriately disclosed classified information . August 24 , 2017 Despite stepping back from the Russia case , Nunes is probing how law enforcement have handled their investigation . He subpoenas records from the Justice Department . December 7 , 2017 Nunes is cleared by the House Ethics Committee . January 3 , 2018 Chris Wray and Rod Rosenstein appeal to Paul Ryan to avoid turning over some sensitive records to Nunes , but Ryan backs up Nunes . January 18 , 2018 House Intelligence Committee votes to make the memo privately available to every member of the House . January 29 , 2018 House Intelligence Committee votes to release the memo , sending it to the White House for review . January 30 , 2018 Trump is caught on a hot mic saying he `` 100 % '' wants to release the memo even though administration officials said he had n't read it yet . January 31 , 2018 The FBI publicly says it has `` grave concerns '' with the accuracy of the memo . February 1 , 2018 A senior administration official says Trump will give the green light for the House to release the memo .
The memo was classified as top secret . How is it becoming public ?
The House Intelligence Committee is using a process that experts say has never been used before . After allowing all members of the House the opportunity to read the secret document — about 200 reportedly did — the committee voted along party lines to send it to the White House . Trump had five days to object to its release , but he declassified it on Friday . The committee also voted on party lines to block the simultaneous release of a Democratic rebuttal , saying it needs to go through the same process .
Why have Republicans and conservative commentators been saying this is so scandalous ?
Before the memo became public , there was a steady drumbeat of dark statements about its contents . Fox News host Sean Hannity said “ this makes Watergate look like stealing a Snickers bar from your local candy store. ” After releasing the memo , Nunes said his research had “ discovered serious violations of the public trust . ”
The basic thrust of their concerns is this : When the Justice Department asked the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court , also known as the FISA court , for a surveillance warrant on Page , some of the information to back up the request came from Christopher Steele , a former British spy who was a longtime FBI source . At the time , Steele was working for Fusion GPS , a research firm that had been hired first by anti-Trump Republicans and later by Democrats to collect opposition research on Trump . The source of Steele 's funding was not disclosed to the court , according to the memo .
Is that a big deal ?
It 's hard to tell how important Steele 's research was to obtain the warrant , or if the secret court had rejected the application had they known more about him . Instead , they reauthorized it three separate times , each time by a different judge . Classified applications to the surveillance court normally are 50 or 60 pages , while the Republican memo is only four . `` You need to know the totality of what 's in the affidavit to know if it 's relevant , ” said Orin Kerr , a USC law professor and an expert in criminal procedure .
There 's also a question about whether to identify of Fusion GPS ' client is relevant . It 's not unusual for law enforcement to field tips from politically motivated sources . `` The FBI gets information from mobsters and terrorists on a regular basis , ” said Benjamin Wittes , a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution . “ It seems a little peculiar to suggest they ca n't get it from Democrats . ”
So how important was the dossier to obtain surveillance ?
Like so many other things about the memo , this is hotly contested . The document references — but does not directly quote — closed-door testimony from Andrew McCabe , who recently stepped down as the FBI 's deputy director . `` No surveillance warrant would have been sought from the [ FISA court ] without the Steele dossier information , ” the memo says . Republicans have pointed to this line as proof that Democratic-funded research was a key part of the case .
McCabe 's full testimony remains classified , so it 's impossible to independently judge the memo 's accuracy . Rep. Adam B. Schiff ( D-Burbank ) , the ranking member on the House Intelligence Committee , said the memo takes McCabe 's comments out of context . It 's also possible that the dossier piqued the FBI 's interest in Page but was n't crucial to establishing probable cause to conduct surveillance .
Los Angeles Times
What are Democrats saying about this whole episode ?
Democrats have described the memo as misleading and inaccurate , a smokescreen to give Trump political talking points to undermine the criminal investigation . House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi ( D-San Francisco ) said Nunes should be stripped of his committee chairmanship . Schiff said Republicans were trying to “ circle the wagons around the White House and distract from the Russia probe. ” Republicans not only blocked simultaneous release of the Democratic response , they refused to let FBI Director Christopher A. Wray brief the panel on his concerns .
Los Angeles Times
Are law enforcement and intelligence officials OK with this memo ?
They are not . Top officials appointed by Trump opposed its release and some did so publicly . The FBI — which is led by Wray , who was picked by the president after he fired Comey last year — issued a statement saying it has “ grave concerns about material omissions of fact that fundamentally impact the memo 's accuracy .
Deputy Atty . Gen. Rod Rosenstein , who appointed Mueller and supervises the special counsel investigation , pushed back against the memo . Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats also privately expressed reservations about releasing the document .
Democrats and independent observers are concerned that the memo 's release will fray the crucial relationship between the intelligence community , which conducts much of its work in secret , and congressional committees , who are charged with providing oversight . Will agencies still want to provide the same amount of classified information if lawmakers will use it to develop and publish partisan reports of their own ?

BATON ROUGE – The second extraordinary session of 2017 already seems ordinary .
The House took a three-day weekend to cool down following its nasty regular session close Thursday , but still convened in normal fashion Monday , 90 minutes tardy . Members continued to playfully fling rubber bands and foam balls at each other , topping off that with a musical birthday tribute to a colleague when the session convened .
Some lawmakers have expressed concern that the next seven days of the extraordinary session will be no different from the previous 60 , even though the process by which the Legislature approves the state operating budget must begin anew .
And it must be done quickly . The deadline for the close of this special session is Monday , and the state agencies have no authorization to spend when the new fiscal year begins on July 1 . The House Appropriations Committee heard testimony on essentially the same version of House Bill 1 which left that chamber two weeks ago . The measure , carrying the sponsorship of Appropriations Chairman Cameron Henry , R-Metairie , currently would withhold $ 206 million from state agencies as a precaution against an unexpected midyear revenue shortfall .
Negotiators from the House had agreed to lower the holdback to $ 100 million by the end of the regular session . The senators wanted to distribute the entire amount of forecast revenue but instruct state agencies to spend prudently – just in case .
That 's where negotiations over 2/10ths of a percent of Louisiana 's $ 29 billion budget ended on last Thursday . When the 6 p.m. deadline arrived , the bill , along with their companion bills House Bills 2 and 3 , which prioritized and funded state and local construction projects , died on the legislative vine .
“ The budgets have a better chance of passing this time around because they are the entire focus , ” said Commissioner of Administration Jay Dardenne , the governor 's chief financial officer .
“ There are no other bills to hear . Legislators are having to face the possibility of telling the public , ‘ I ca n't do the job you 've elected me to do ' for another week . ”
Gov . John Bel Edwards has called four special sessions since his inauguration in 2016 . They cost taxpayers $ 60,000 per day to run , even when they take off some of the days .
Effects of budget instability go beyond the potential cost of further negotiation .
“ Bonds and loans are harder or more expensive to secure because we refuse to live within our means , ” Henry said . “ We have certain projects we can not accomplish because banks recognize budget gimmicks and see midyear cuts . ”
The current budget also delays payments on $ 28 million in legal settlements the state has incurred through judgments rendered , $ 10 million of which accrue interest over time . Henry said there 's not enough money to pay them .
That interest will likely build up until the Legislature finds new forms of revenue , which it failed to do this year , or unless it further cuts razor-thin operating margins for state agencies . It wo n't be able to try again in regular session until 2019 because the Legislature constitutionally is forbidden to take up revenue raising measures in even-numbered years .
“ It 's my understanding that the governor will call us back into another special session if we do n't pass the budget he wants by June 19 , ” Henry said . “ He 's setting a precedent for the next session that he 'll keep calling us into special session until he gets his way . That 's not how you run a democracy , that 's more like a dictatorship . ”
If the Legislature ca n't come to a compromise and pass a budget by the beginning of the new fiscal year on July 1 , no one is sure what will happen .
“ That 's something we 've been talking about , ” Dardenne said . “ But I do n't know . There 's no statutory measure or precedent . We could try to do something on a month-to-month basis where the division of administration and the treasurer 's office fund agencies [ proportionately ] ” with the revenue from taxes that will keep arriving with or without an authorizing document to spend it .
Funding agencies by their size or total operating budget does not allow lawmakers to prioritize based on need or value , which is essentially why the budgeting process exists .
“ That 's just never happened before , ” Henry said , acknowledging there 's still room for compromise . “ We want to pass a responsible budget . We would have liked to do that last Thursday , and we 'd like to do it now . ”
The special session will be half expired Wednesday . HB 1 is expected to hit the House floor for discussion and passage on that day , then then head to the Senate for its take . By Friday , it could be ready for a committee of three representatives and three senators to come to a compromise over differences .
But the Legislature was in that exact spot a week ago and it ended up in a House meltdown .
To add to the dilemma , there 's a hurricane supposedly heading for the Gulf . That would make two storms facing Louisiana .

The U.S. government 's policies at the Mexico border have drawn a lot of attention to the plight of asylum seekers . A group of doctors is helping migrants prove they were tortured and abused so that they can gain permanent residence in the United States .
“ American is seen as a beacon of hope , that 's how I see it , ” said Isatou Jallow , who arrived in the U.S. from the Gambia in 2012 .
Although she earned a law degree , she says she could not find a job in her home country , because of her disability . She 's in a wheelchair and says she faced a lot of discrimination .
Jallow 's also a survivor of female genital mutilation , a form of child abuse .
“ By the time I came here I could n't handle what was happening to me anymore , I saw the U.S. as a safe-haven , ” she said .
Jallow came to Seattle seeking asylum and was granted that status , in part , because of a group of volunteer medical professionals , who helped document her disability and abuse , and present that evidence to an immigration judge .
“ I 've seen everything , I 've seen the best and the worst that this world has to offer , incredible abuse , torture , neglect , direct threats to life , ” said Dr. Richard Kovar , a family physician at Country Doctor Community Health Center in Seattle , who , on his own time , has completed roughly 350 medical evaluations of asylum seekers .
“ It 's unbelievable how much pain one individual can inflict on another . Many times it 's state-sponsored abuse , and sometimes it 's just people who are threatened by other situations like gang violence , domestic violence , where their local or regional government is unable to protect them , ” Kovar said .
Lutheran Community Services Northwest helps coordinate the local programs helping asylum seekers .
The effort with volunteer doctors and clinicians started becoming much more organized a few years ago , and now involves dozens of professionals in the Northwest .
They do the evaluations for free and say they do n't take sides in the immigration debate .
The process of proving abuse and torture can take years , Kovar said . The families who have arrived at the U.S.-Mexico border in recent months still have a lengthy legal process ahead of them , and advocates say that process is getting more sluggish .
“ The way that they are being received , that 's not the America that I came to , ” Jallow said .
She recently started a non-profit to help others pursue education , and she 's getting ready to go back to school for a Ph.D .
Although she is a long way from her family , she 's now in a safe a place , a country she calls home .
“ I can be myself here , no matter what I look like , no matter what my background is , ” Jallow said .

This is a surprising fall for a player who was projected as a top-five pick when we started this evaluation process . He slides a bit in part due to the early run on QBs .

A bus carrying over 20 school children caught fire at Trade Moore Estate , Lugbe , along airport road in the Federal Capital Territory ( FCT ) , Abuja , LEADERSHIP Sunday gathered .
An eyewitness said a driver carrying the school children on a bus had parked the vehicle at the estate , but after some minutes , the bus went up in flames .
The school children were said to be pupils of Little Drops School , Abuja .
While some of the residents attributed the cause of the incident to the bad condition of the bus , our reporter gathered that the driver of the bus had kept a keg of petrol in the car which caused the fire .
An eyewitness who spoke to LEADERSHIP Sunday said nobody had been able to unravel the mystery behind the incident .
A neighbour to one of the victims , who prefers anonymity , said many of the children have died in various hospitals while others are receiving treatment .
She called on the federal government and the FCT administration to establish proper monitoring measures on private schools in the country to ensure safety of students .
“ Words ca n't express the pain and sadness I feel right now . A school bus went up in flames yesterday around Trade Moore axis . Two kids
could n't be saved and they were burnt alive . I heard they were siblings . Three others who are badly burnt died today .
“ May their souls rest with God and may He give the parents the strength to bear this great loss , ” Mrs
Betty Lo'la Amihere posted on her Facebook page .
At the time of filing this report , both the police and the Federal Road Safety Corp ( FRSC ) could not confirm the incident .
LEADERSHIP Sunday findings showed that Dr Kelvin Eze , who works with Federal Ministry of Health , lost two children in the incident .

In an interview with French TV , Aveiro said : `` I like Paris . I come every now and again .
`` The last time was when my son received the Ballon d'Or . It was a great honour . When I arrived I was treated well by everyone .
`` Convince Cristiano to sign for PSG ? To be honest , it would n't annoy me [ if he did ] , but I would prefer him to return to Manchester United . ''
The 57th Infantry Regiment of the Ottoman army , who fought against the allies in the Gallipoli Campaign when Lt. Col. Mustafa Kemal issued the order , `` I am not ordering you to attack , I order you to die ! '' had their names written in gold letters and were among the cornerstones of the war , which took place 103 years ago .
During the heated times of World War I , the allied troops who planned to land after failing in passing the Dardanelles took the action to realize their plans in the region of Arıburnu on the morning of April 25 , 1915 .
The 19th Division Cmdr . Lt. Mustafa Kemal sent the 57th Infantry Regiment of the division with an artillery battery and cavalry troop to the region after some gunshots were heard in Arıburnu on this day .
Many soldiers in the 57th Regiment , struggling against the eight full-fledged enemy troops together with supporting units , were martyred and they made history with their heroism , going to their death on purpose .
English Senior Officer Gen. Sir Ian Standish Monteith Hamilton told about the attack of the 57th Regiment and other troops , who advanced on with the order of Mustafa Kemal without any hesitation , `` Mountains continue to bear Turks . '' This sentence shows the fight that Turkish soldiers put up in those years .

`` Our distance between opposite trenches is 8 meters , that is , death is certain . Those in the first trench die all and the ones in the second trench take their place . However , do you know how they are cold-blooded and trust in God ? They see those who die and know that they will die in three minutes . Nevertheless , they do not hesitate even for a moment , '' said Mustafa Kemal about the soldiers who gave their lives to protect their country in this battle . The 57th Regiment and other troops were the basis of the defense .
The heroism and success of the 57th Regiment are being told among the thousands of heroes who wrote the legend of `` Gallipoli Could not Be Passed '' even if it has been 103 years , and the martyrs ' cemetery of this regiment on the historical Gallipoli Peninsula is visited by hundreds of thousands of people every year . The ones who visit the place share their gratitude and pray .
Tens of thousands of youth commemorate the martyrs of the Gallipoli Campaign , especially the 57th Regiment , with the `` Fidelity March to the 57th Regiment , '' which they organize on April 25 , and feel proud with the heroism of their ancestors . Associate professor Burhan Sayılır from Anadolu University , who studies on Mustafa Kemal Atatürk 's principles and the Republic History , told Anadolu Agency ( AA ) that the 57th Regiment came to the region with the order of Lt. Col. Mustafa Kemal and showed heroism in the defense of it until the end of the war .
Implying the 57th Regiment was established between 1892 and 1893 and took place in the Balkan Wars , Sayılır said , `` It was established in World War I again and was in charge in Gallipoli . After Gallipoli , Galicia , Syria and Palestine theaters came . In the Turkish War of Independence , it established as a reserve force . It joined some combats in the Aegean region , as well . ''
Mentioning the regiment comprised of 49 officers and 3,638 soldiers in the Gallipoli War , Sayılır continued , `` They had 2,288 rifles . When the struggle started , they took their place starting from April 25 . They seriously succeeded , especially in the first two or three days . New soldiers came in the place of officers and soldiers who died during the war . Twenty-five officers were martyred in the whole war . It is a serious number but other soldiers even if their military rank is not same took the places of these officers . [ A total of ] 1,817 soldiers were martyred , as well . When we look at the general rate , half of the soldiers became martyrs . In fact , this is a great heroism . It will be wrong to leave the real heroism in the shadow , adding different stories or bending the truth . ''
Sayılır noted that the commander of the 57th Regiment was Hüseyin Avni Bey and after he was martyred Maj. Murat Bey took his place .
Later , Third Battalion 's Cmdr . Ali Hayri Bey was the commander of the regiment . `` All the names of these martyrs are written on the name list of the 57th Regiment . Names of 323 people are written on the stones on the ground , the rest is written on the pedestal under the memorial . These lists are the true ones . Visitors can see the real names in here , '' Sayılır stressed .
Professor Mithat Atabay , who is an academic at History Department in Çanakkale Onsekiz Mart University Faculty of Science and
Letters , also implied that the heroism of the 57th Regiment is still told with a great honor 103 years later . He added Hüseyin Avni Bey was martyred because of a shrapnel piece .
Explaining , the regiment had lost 2,274 soldiers before the Gallipoli Campaign , Atabay continued , `` The casualty rate of the 57th Regiment is 61.7 percent when it is compared to the beginning . This rate nearly doubles the casualty rate in the Ottoman army . This shows that the soldiers of the 57th Regiment risked their lives and fought heroically . ''

Russia 's Federal Security Service ( FSB ) has detained ISIS-linked terrorists who were planning attacks on the Moscow public transport system and other crowded places in Moscow.Following the analysis of the materials found in the detainees ' house outside Moscow , the FSB said that it was a dangerous peroxide-based explosive , also known as the 'Mother of Satan . ' T '' We have taken samples . According to these samples it is triacetone triperoxide ( TATP ) , a very dangerous initiate explosive , '' a serviceman is heard saying in a video taken during the FSB operation.The video features materials to produce a bomb stored in the house , as well as several grenades found in the basement and Kalashnikov assault rifles.The FSB says it has suppressed `` a terrorist group which was plotting to commit a series of terrorist attacks in places of mass gatherings , including those on transport and major shopping venues in Moscow . '' The statement adds that the group was going to use `` suicide bombers and high-powered explosive devices . `` Two suicide bombers , an explosives production specialist , as well as an Islamic State ( IS , formerly ISIS/ISIL ) emissary who masterminded the planned attacks were detained during a special operation in Moscow Region on Monday.The FSB also discovered and neutralized an explosives production laboratory.The security agency also said that there was one Russian citizen and three citizens of Central Asian states among the detainees .

Thieves left a trail of destruction in their wake after stealing two large dumper trucks from a building site in Yorkshire .
- > Yorkshire director filmed giving middle finger to speed cameras and using laser jammer on Range Rover
The stolen vehicles were used to plough into CCTV camera posts and bollards leading to a subway under the M1 , before being driven across Temple Newsam Park Golf Course .
Police were alerted just before 10.50pm on Monday when one of the dumper trucks was driven into a CCTV camera mounted on a post in Kendal Drive , Halton Moor in Leeds .
The camera was knocked down and the front section of the vehicle overturned .
Two further cameras in the area were later found to have been damaged in the same way .
With support from the National Police Air Service helicopter , the second vehicle was found crashed and abandoned in woodland off Halton Moor Road .

Inspector Mick Preston , who heads neighbourhood policing in east Leeds , said : “ The two vehicles that were stolen are very large earth moving machines and the way they were driven over some considerable distance could quite easily have resulted in someone being killed or seriously injured .
“ As it is , the incident has caused many thousands of pounds worth of damage to council-operated CCTV cameras , to the golf course , to the two vehicles themselves and to other objects , such as fences , along the route they took .
“ We are carrying out extensive enquiries to identify those responsible and are appealing for any information from the public that could assist the investigation . ''

Enquiries established that the two articulated dumper trucks had been stolen from a construction site in Knowsthorpe Lane .
It was found that they had been driven from the site onto Pontefract Lane through concrete bollards leading to a subway under the M1 and across the golf course , causing damage to the course itself .

Both vehicles were then driven through woods off Halton Moor Road where one vehicle was abandoned , before the other continued on to damage the CCTV cameras .
Forensic examination of both the dumper tracks has taken place .
Insp Preston said : `` Witnesses have reported seeing a large number of people around the vehicle at the time it was used to damage the cameras and we are interested in speaking to any of those people .
“ This has clearly been a deliberate attempt to disable the CCTV cameras which are there to deter and detect crime and assist in keeping people in that area safe .
“ We know the law-abiding majority of people in the area will not condone this sort of behaviour and will support our efforts to find those responsible .
“ We have put additional patrols in place to reassure the community while work is carried out to repair and replace the cameras . ”

An Indian police officer who saved a Muslim man from being lynched by a Hindu mob is now receiving death threats and been forced to go on leave .
A video of Gagandeep Singh protecting the man – who was visiting a temple with his Hindu girlfriend in the northern Uttarakhand state – went viral on social media last week . While some initially hailed Sikh police officer as a hero , others have expressed vengeful outrage at his defense of the interfaith couple .
Relationships between Muslims and Hindus are a point of contention in India , where religious radicals have coined the term `` love jihad '' to accuse Muslims of seducing Hindu women in order to convert them .
Singh was initially praised as a `` role model '' for his actions , with the story featuring in mainstream Indian publications .
`` I was just doing my duty . Even if I was not in uniform , I would have done the same thing and every Indian should do the same , '' Singh told DB Post .
`` If the issue is saving the life of a person , religion should not come in the way . I would have failed in doing my duty if I had not saved him , '' he said .
However , Singh soon began receiving threats to his life , police say . Even some politicians publicly sided with the mob .
`` It 's wrong when these people ( Muslim men ) bring Hindu girls to our places of worship despite knowing it 's a temple and it 's pious , '' ruling Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP ) lawmaker Rakesh Nainwal told BBC .
`` Why did these men go to our temple with an intention to destroy the Hindu culture ? '' another BJP politician Rajkumar Thukral told the ANI News Agency , adding that Hindus do not `` have the right '' to go to a mosque .
But some residents of the Ramnagar district , where the attack occurred , have expressed disgust at the poor treatment of Singh , who has now been sent on leave by the police department .
`` When a boy and a girl go somewhere together by choice , then how can these right-wing groups call it a case of 'love jihad ' and attack them ? '' resident Ajit Sahni told BBC .
Studies have found that people who speak more than one language build multitasking skills and usually have a better memory .
A MacMillan International Academy Spanish teacher is helping her students do both of those things in a fun and friendly environment . Her name is Carolina Neglen .
Originally from Columbia , Neglen moved to Alabama almost two decades ago to attend the University of Alabama . Since then , her goal inside the classroom has been to educate her kids about the whole world that exists outside of their school .
`` My main thing , especially being from another country , in Montgomery is that you want people to know a little bit about where you come from , and open their minds up . There is a whole world full of experiences and new things that they can explore , and I want to give them that . I want to open up their curiosity so that they want to travel , keep on learning , keep on learning Spanish and other languages , '' Neglen said .
Neglen uses interactive techniques in the classroom to help her students become proficient speakers in their new language . But it 's not just the kiddos who are learning - she is reminded of valuable life lessons every day .
`` It takes you back to how simple things , you forget to value them - a hug , a 'hi how are you ? ' and a high five in the halls - those little things they give you , the children , that innocence , it 's amazing and I 'm proud to be their teacher , '' Neglen said .
After two years of teaching youngsters at MacMillan , it makes Neglen happy to know she is contributing to her kid 's in a positive way .
`` I think I have made a difference now in their lives ... and I think we all want to do that a little bit at some point , so I 'm happy , '' Neglen said .

Every impacted Bella Vista homeowner now considering legal action against council
TOM LEE/STUFF Residents of the failed Bella Vista Homes in Tauranga say full market value minus defects is the only outcome that should be on the table .
Tauranga City Council is staring down the barrel of 21 legal challenges over the Bella Vista debacle .
All homeowners are now considering legal options .
On Monday , Stuff revealed owners of two properties in the failed development were filing papers against the council at the High Court at Tauranga .
Now property owners from the 19 other affected homes have also confirmed they have engaged a legal representative .
The legal action occurs after 21 homes on Lakes Boulevard were evacuated in March after shoddy workmanship caused the homes to be labelled dangerous or affected .

Four of the homes had full code of compliance sign-off and all had passed some level of council inspection .
All homeowners are united in their expectation of council in that full market value , without any defect , is the best outcome .
This puts a potential settlement amount between $ 10 million and $ 20m .
`` We are considering legal proceedings and hope for market value , without defects , for our properties , '' homeowner Andre Stewart said .
`` We believe this is fair . ''
Stewart said the June 6 council meeting - where an independent investigation into potential council accountability will be revealed - feels like `` Judgment Day '' .
Stewart is disappointed the independent report , by Paul Heath QC , will not be circulated to homeowners before June 6 .
`` At the start we were told we would have complete transparency , but what we were not told is that would only happen in our reports of the problems with our homes and reports directing faults towards Bella Vista , '' he said .
`` We asked many questions of council and we still do n't know the answers to the 'why ' .
`` There are two sides to every story and we , along with the public , want to hear the council 's side . ''
Council said the Heath report will be revealed to councillors in a public-excluded session on June 6 and homeowners will hear about the report and council 's decision on any recompense at 5pm that day .
Tauranga MP Todd Muller said council needs to be supporting the homeowners and look for ways to prioritise remediation before talking about liability .
`` Whether the decision they come to is to remediate or buy back the properties , they need to get on with it and make the situation right by the landowners , not drag it out through a long and extended legal process , '' he said .
`` I hope that TCC has listened sympathetically to the affected families and treated them but respect throughout the process . ''

A stuntwoman was killed while riding a motorcycle on the set of the Ryan Reynolds movie `` Deadpool 2 '' in Vancouver , Canada , police confirmed Monday .
WorkSafeBC , British Columbia 's OSHA equivalent , was on the scene along with law enforcement , the Vancouver Police Department said in a statement that promised further information as it becomes available .
The woman , whose name has not been released , was treated by an ambulance crew after the 8 a.m. crash but was pronounced dead on the scene , the Vancouver Sun reported . Witnesses told the newspaper she lost control , jumped a curb and slammed through the glass windows of an office building .
The woman successfully performed the stunt four times , but had a problem with the throttle on her fifth practice run and lost control when the engine engaged , according to Canada 's Global News , which had a crew on the scene gathering information about a fatal bus crash that happened nearby on Sunday .
LOS ANGELES -- As Arizona Coyotes general manager John Chayka took his place in the far left corner of the visiting press box at Staples Center , his age was not the only thing that set the 28-year-old apart from many of his contemporaries . Eschewing the coffee favored by most hockey folks , Chayka instead sipped a cup of mint tea and chased it with occasional gulps from a bottle of water mixed with a BioSteel nutritional supplement .
Chayka pointed out that that the antioxidants in the tea and the nutrients in the supplement are more likely to help him stay healthy over the grind of an 82-game season than an artificial -- and temporary -- boost from caffeine .
`` You can get worn down and get sick in this business , '' Chayka said , explaining why he chooses to go healthier with his beverage choices .
Chayka has been celebrated as one of the NHL 's brightest young minds ever since he became the youngest GM in NHL history when Arizona hired him in 2016 . During a preseason game against the Los Angeles Kings , he gave ESPN.com a peek into how that mind is working feverishly to reshape the Coyotes from one of the league 's longtime also-rans into a contender .
On this particular night , Chayka was mostly focused on how effectively his team was moving the puck up the ice . `` We want to see what our hit rate [ coming out of the zone ] is , '' he said .
Editor 's Picks Season preview : Arizona Coyotes Significant changes were made in the desert since the end of last season , including bringing in a new coach and a new goalie , and saying goodbye to a longtime captain . But will all that be enough to change the results ?

Uncomfortable questions for all 31 NHL teams Some questions about the new season are obvious . ( Will the Penguins three-peat ? ) But some questions are n't so obvious and/or fans are n't willing to go there . We asked both the easy and the tough questions for them . 2 Related
From a player-personnel perspective , he also wanted to get a good look at first-round draft picks Dylan Strome and Clayton Keller -- along with new acquisitions Jason Demers , Niklas Hjalmarsson and Derek Stepan .
The Coyotes finished with 70 points last season and missed the playoffs for the fifth consecutive year , so Chayka made some aggressive -- and startling -- moves during the summer . First , he informed longtime captain Shane Doan , over breakfast at a local restaurant , that the team would not be offering the soon-to-be free agent a new contract . Then Chayka traded veteran goaltender Mike Smith to the Calgary Flames . Former coach Dave Tippett and the Coyotes also agreed to part ways , and Chayka replaced him with Pittsburgh Penguins assistant coach Rick Tocchet , who played for and had a previous stint as an assistant with the Coyotes .
Adding Stepan from the New York Rangers , Hjalmarsson from the Chicago Blackhawks and Demers from the Florida Panthers was designed to give the team veteran depth to help the younger players develop with less pressure . Chakya and the Coyotes also hope that Tocchet 's animated personality will give the team a different type of leadership than did the stoic Tippett . The Coyotes also added goaltender Antti Raanta , who was Henrik Lundqvist 's backup with the Rangers , to replace Smith .
`` I think the focus was , 'We have this core group of young players that we want to cultivate and grow . How do we put them in the best position to have success ? ' '' Chayka said . `` For us , [ the priority ] was surrounding them with veteran leadership that could grow with them . ''
Though Chayka is known as an analytics whiz , he is clearly comfortable speaking hockey 's traditional language with assistant general manager Steve Sullivan . A high-scoring winger at the junior hockey level and OHL draft pick whose career ended because of a back injury , Chayka went on to co-found Stathletes , a hockey analytics company , in 2010 while he was earning a business degree . Stathletes ' goal was to use video analysis to create new statistics that better help measure the ability and value of players -- and to make those numbers more accessible . Thus , he does n't come across as a `` stats geek '' who ca n't communicate with hockey lifers -- the knee-jerk stereotype for younger execs who subscribe to analytics .
In fact , the conversation between Chayka and Sullivan -- whom Arizona promoted to assistant GM this summer from his previous role as director of player development -- in the press box that night in L.A. , occasionally sounded like an echo chamber . A slash by rookie Coyotes forward Christian Fischer elicited a `` you ca n't do that '' exclamation from Chayka , which was echoed almost immediately by Sullivan , who then noted , `` ... but it 's so natural to do it . ''

Though Sullivan -- who played 16 seasons in the NHL with the New Jersey Devils , Toronto Maple Leafs , Chicago Blackhawks , Nashville Predators , Penguins and Coyotes -- admits that he was skeptical at first of Chayka , he was impressed with the latter 's decision-making during Chayka 's first draft with the team , then as assistant general manager , in 2015 . Sullivan recalled how Chayka was n't afraid to voice his opinion about prospects , even when it was contrary to those of some of his older co-workers . That chutzpah quickly won Sullivan over , and the two became friends .
`` He had his laptop and he had all these numbers [ that explained ] what draft picks were worth , what would happen if you make a trade and what you would need in return if we were trading a certain pick or certain player , '' Sullivan said . `` He was pretty vocal and confident in himself for someone we had just hired . I was still suspicious , but it takes very , very few conversations with him about hockey to realize he does have a very high knowledge of the game . And once you realize that , it just becomes two guys talking about the game . ''
Chayka uses analytics as a tool in his decision-making process and as a resource in dealing with players , coaches , agents and opposing GMs . But he also relies on the eye test . He had written the Coyotes ' lines in a leather-bound notepad , and at various points during the first period , he scribbled ideas and thoughts on the page .
`` I just write down my general feelings and thoughts and things I want to research deeper , '' Chayka said .
Early on , Chayka seemed pleased with Demers , the puck-moving defenseman Arizona had acquired from the Panthers for forward Jamie McGinn in mid-September . Chayka noted the way that Demers almost effortlessly moved the puck up the ice on two breakouts .
`` That 's actually two good plays by Demers there , '' Chayka said to Sullivan after the situations , which came almost in rapid succession .
Chayka also took note of the minutiae of the game . When Strome entered the faceoff dot , he stood further away from the circle than some other players .
`` Look at Stromer , he does n't stand anywhere near the lines , '' Chayka mused to Sullivan . `` He prefers it . ''
Chaka was n't pointing a out a problem ; he simply found it interesting that Strome took an unconventional strategy toward draws -- and it seemed to work . Strome was 63 percent on faceoffs during the game .
Throughout the period , Chayka did see plenty of situations where his team could improve -- particularly on delayed outlet passes from Arizona 's zone .
`` That 's a late read , '' Chayka said after a defenseman missed the forward skating up the ice .
As he continues to tinker with his team 's lineup -- the Demers acquisition was the 17th personnel addition the Coyotes made this offseason -- Chayka realizes that a GM 's job does n't cease one the season begins . Even on this night , a meaningless preseason game , he continued to analyze Arizona 's every move and figure out ways the players could improve .

`` I think you always try to find something to work on . The reality is a lot of times the end result might work out , but the process is n't what you 'd like it to be , '' Chayka said . `` Sometimes that 's hockey . Sometimes guys make the wrong play , but they 're skilled enough to get away with it . ''
The Coyotes took two penalties late in the period , which led to a Kings 5-on-3 advantage . Arizona killed off one of the power plays , but Los Angeles defenseman Drew Doughty blasted a shot past Coyotes goaltender Louis Domingue to put the Kings up 1-0 .
The box went silent for a few minutes after the goal , as Chayka and Sullivan -- along with goaltending coach Jon Elkin , who sat on the far right side -- tried to digest what had just happened . Then Chayka and Sullivan started to chat and saw they were on the same page .
`` We got caught out there with three forwards . We kind of lost our structure for a second , and [ when you do that ] good teams make you pay , '' Chayka said .
The period ended with the Coyotes down 1-0 -- and they eventually lost the game 4-1 -- but Chayka had seen some progress from his team and a few blocks to build on for the rest of the game , leading into opening night .
`` It 's an evaluation game . I thought the way [ Tocchet ] used his bench was really effective for trying to understand players in different positions , '' Chayka said . `` I think 5-on-5 , we outplayed them . Obviously , we took some penalties . We know they 're trying to crack down on slashing , and we just ca n't do it , so we cleaned that up , and some of that is just a learning thing where it 's new to slash rules . We learned from our mistakes . I think our young guys will , and we 'll just keep evolving , so I was happy . ''

In the last few years , Sundance has moved beyond just showing feature films and documentaries with the Festival making huge strides towards embracing television , short-form series , and even VR installations . In the ever-changing landscape of entertainment , Sundance has tried to be a step ahead of the curve and it 's one of the reasons the Festival is the place to be every January .
This year , Sundance launched the Indie Episodic program , which put its emphasis on independent perspectives and innovative storytelling told in multiple installments . One of the shows that premiered in the category was Halfway There . Starring Matthew Lillard as a recovering addict that runs a sober living facility teetering on the edge of bankruptcy , the show weaves in an interesting group of characters , including Blythe Danner , who plays Lillard 's mother and who has her own addictions to overcome . Directed by Rick Rosenthal and written by Nick Morton , Halfway There also stars Esai Morales , Sarah Shahi , Nishi Munshi , Paige Hurd , Matt O'Leary , Sheaun McKinney , and Jane Stephens Rosenthal .
Shortly after seeing the pilot I got to sit down with Matthew Lillard , Rick Rosenthal and Nick Morton at the Collider Sundance Studio . They talked about how the show came together , how they got financing , memorable moments from filming , how they decided to premiere at Sundance , if the intention was always to make the show thirty minutes , and a lot more . In addition , Rick Rosenthal shared an awesome story about how he landed the job directing Halloween 2 and Matthew Lillard shared a great story about how he got his SAG card . Both are really worth hearing and they 're towards the end of the interview .
Check out what they had to say in the player above and below is exactly what we talked about .
Finally , a huge thank you to everyone at Kia and The Future Party for helping to make these interviews happen at the Kia Supper Suite and offering up transportation in the all new Kia Stinger high performance Sportback for our guests . We 'd also like to thank Altec Lansing , Kunde Wines , Blue Moon Brewing , and Topo Chico for their support
Matthew Lillard , Rick Rosenthal and Nick Morton :
How did the project come together ?
Was it tough to get financing ?
Was it always the intention to make the show 30 minutes ?
When did they think about premiering at Sundance ?
They share memorable moments from filming .
Rick Rosenthal talks about how it was the noisiest set he 's ever been on .
How the pilot ends on a cliffhanger .

Dr. Stutz : “ It 's Been a Great Year ! ”
District superintendent looks forward to a creative summer , looks back on a productive year
By Michael McAllister
Dr. Janet Stutz , having completed her first academic year as superintendent of Grinnell-Newburg CSD , promoted summer programs and assessed initial accomplishments in an interview with Our Grinnell on Friday , June 9 .
Calling her transition to Grinnell “ the best move of my life , ” Dr. Stutz went on to say , “ We love it here . Grinnell is a great place to live in and work . ”
This summer , she hopes to involve the public in discussions regarding facility development . The following press release outlines the program .
The Grinnell-Newburg Community School District will be hosting Learning Environment Sessions on June 15 , August 30 , and September 6 at 6:00 p.m. at the Drake Library in the Community Room . The purpose of the event is to host an active learning session for our community regarding learning environments that foster creativity , collaboration , critical thinking and communication . The Administrative Team will be in attendance , along with the District 's new architect firm , CMBA . It is our hope that you will be able to join us on one of these days . These initial sessions will begin the journey through the development of a facility plan later in the year .
Dr. Stutz is also excited about SLICK , the summer learning program that involves partners AmeriCorps , Grinnell College , and the Grinnell-Newburg School District . According to information supplied by Grinnell College , this summer 's program “ is made possible by a 2015 grant through the Iowa Commission on Volunteer Service and two generous donations from the Claude W. and Dolly Ahrens Foundation and Grinnell Mutual Reinsurance . ”
Supplying the following link to five short videos that overview the program , Dr. Stutz referred to them as “ gems , ” and indeed the videos do capture the creativity , energy , and enthusiasm of the young people who will drive the program and surely guarantee its success : click here .. SLICK videos !
Of course , creativity , energy , and enthusiasm are not necessarily reserved for the young . No better proof can be offered than Janet Stutz herself . She is quick to laugh , and the word “ awesome ” pops up frequently when she speaks . An educator and administrator for nearly three decades , she came to Grinnell after three years at Orland Park , Illinois , where , according to a statement from her district 's board , she “ played an integral part in rebuilding the relationship between … the District and the Community . ”
Once in Grinnell , one of Dr. Stutz 's primary goals was “ to get to know the community , to get to know people , to be out and about , to be very visible…to really get to know and have some conversations with some people about Grinnell . ”
As part of the get-acquainted and visibility process , Dr. Stutz and associates created # wearegrinnell , a Twitter account designed to “ let teachers tell our story…what we believe in , what we believe about our kids . ”
“ I feel like we have room to grow there , ” Dr. Stutz continued , but she also feels that the Twitter presence is effective as a tool to inform the public about the culture of K-12 education in Grinnell and to celebrate students .
She also engaged in listening tours— “ A lot of information gathering ” necessary for the challenges ahead .
One topic she encountered frequently during those initial learning sessions was that of school facilities .
“ I knew that that was something I had a lot more to learn about , ” she stated .
Dr. Stutz and her administrative team first completed an audit on their own , and then they brought in Estes Construction for additional evaluation .
Taking yet another step , Dr. Stutz consulted the work of Jeffrey Lackney , Ph.D. , who specializes in classroom design and innovative architecture designed to stimulate students and promote learning .
Lackney 's principles and those of other researchers will be explored in the Learning Environment Sessions mentioned in the press release above .
As she continued to get into Grinnell , Dr. Stutz worked to open and maintain lines of communication . She began a weekly update to the board , posting each update to the school 's website . To assist the community , she established a virtual backpack online where resources may be accessed by students and by community members . As of the moment , the virtual backpack lists 50 links ranging from elementary school to high school and encompassing a range of subjects such as basketball , computer coding , and tennis .
“ We had to find a way to reduce costs , ” Dr. Stutz stated , referring to another primary goal . She sought “ the just-right kind of staff. ” Through a combination of early retirement options and assignment shifts , the budget was reduced by some $ 450,000 ; however , budget savings came at the cost of teaching experience . The superintendent stated that approximately 300 years of experience were lost , yet the retirements were voluntary and no “ pink slipping ” was involved .
Goals were that “ no one loses a job , and no one loses programming , ” Dr. Stutz stated . By employing a “ budget shift ” rather than an outright budget reduction , the current program level was not only maintained but also enhanced : Spanish is now available at the middle school with assistance from the high school staff .
Offering a wide range of programs is important not only for students and their education but also to maintain and increase enrollment . “ It 's all driven by student enrollment , ” Dr. Stutz stressed , referring to the degree of funding that an Iowa school receives .
It is a complicated process , school funding , but in summary an Iowa school 's general fund—the repository behind approximately 80 % of a school 's expenditures—comes from an allocation of roughly $ 6,500 per student . In Iowa , equality of funding exists , meaning that every school receives essentially the same dollar amount per student . In some other states , like Illinois , such is not the case . Dr. Stutz is grateful for the Iowa methodology that assures every school equal footing .
She is also grateful that the Iowa legislature did not reduce allocations . While there may not have been much new money approved—about 1.1 % , which translates to about $ 198,000—neither were there cuts .
Dr. Stutz also speaks highly of the “ real team effort ” apparent during negotiations with the faculty union and the physical plant employee union . Referring specifically to the talks with teachers , she stated that discussions prompted “ the fastest settlement I think I 've ever participated in . ”
Next year 's budget will likely present new challenges as there is talk of no increase from the state , but meanwhile Dr. Stutz is pleased with fiscal progress to date .
Once there were the three R 's , but of course they were never all actually “ R 's , ” and reading , writing , and arithmetic remain the basis of education today . Yet today 's workplace demands emphasis on what we can call the four “ C 's ” : creativity , critical thinking , collaboration , and communication .
Emphasis on these qualities coupled with the head-spinning advancement of technology has caused administrators and educators to re-evaluate the role of the teacher and the configuration of the classroom . Today 's mission for the teacher in the classroom can be more a matter of facilitation than omnipotent , omniscient instruction , and the classroom itself is acknowledged to be an integral part of the process .
There is a joke that circulates among educators . It is a variation of the Rip Van Winkle story . In it , Rip wakes up in the current year and is ushered around a typical community so that he can see all that has changed since he fell asleep .
He sees an automobile , and he is amazed . He sees a television , and he is astounded . He sees a computer connected to the World Wide Web , and he is struck with sheer disbelief .
And then his escorts show him a typical school classroom .
“ Oh , yeah , ” he says proudly , a spark of recognition in his eye . “ I know what this is ! Except in my day the blackboards were black . ”
How can classrooms be arranged more productively ? How can skills demanded by the 21st century be facilitated by the spaces in which students learn ? How can technology become a part of the instructional process rather than merely a bells-and-whistle add-on ?
Dr. Stutz points to a vanguard group of twenty Grinnell-Newburg educators trained by Apple to deal with precisely these types of questions . In addition , four instructors are on the Apple Campus this summer
“ And that 's important , ” she adds . “ When you invest so much in technology , you want to make sure that professional development continues . ”
The 21st-century workplace is demanding . Dr. Stutz speaks about employers who want workers “ ready to problem-solve , ” and that kind of worker requires the Four C 's . That kind of worker must be creative , must ask questions , must share , and must be able to express him- or herself .
A classroom that is arranged for group interaction in addition to individual reception can promote the type of teamwork that today 's employers seek . This possibility is one of several that Dr. Stutz and her team will explore this summer and during the year a full facilities plan will emerge .
Just as learning environments and pedagogy must reflect the needs of the workforce , so must they strive to inspire young people . Dr. Stutz feels that Generation Y students—the so-called Millennials— “ have a hard time dealing with disappointment . They have a hard time dealing with the word ‘ no . ' ” However , she quickly adds , “ they also have this interesting drive about them to want to be the best . … They just have this mindset that they can do anything , and some of them make that happen because of the good choices ” that they make .
“ Our children have to be able to leave high school and leave college solving problems . We do n't want to always give [ students ] the answer . ”
As positive as Dr. Stutz is , however , she is aware that some students ' needs go tragically unmet . In extreme cases , students can be driven to extreme solutions .
Dr. Stutz speaks on the topic of suicide awareness and prevention—for example , she did so last October at the Midwest Social Workers Conference in Lisle , Illinois . She has worked with Erika 's Lighthouse , an organization that deals with adolescent depression , and she has been recognized by the AnnMarie Foundation for her contributions to an implementation plan in response to AnnMarie 's Law . The foundation seeks to “ prevent youth suicide and bullying by increasing internet safety through awareness and education , ” its website reports .
As for the future , Dr. Stutz expects the coming year to bring continued emphasis on culture and climate , a second vanguard group receiving advanced professional development , and a concentration on discipline literacy— “ focusing on literacy integration through all the content areas and revamping some of the curriculum . ”
She is pleased that people in Grinnell are “ so open to thinking things through , to thinking outside the box. ” By keeping things positive , challenges can be opportunities .
“ There 's a lot to do still , but it 's all good work . This is an exciting time to be in education , ” Dr. Stutz concluded .
As little girls ( and even as grownups , tbh ) , Disney princesses were undoubtedly our heroines . We watched each one fight for themselves and for love , all while working hard and looking good—who says they are n't still our # lifepegs ?
That said , let us take a minute and imagine them wearing our country 's finest . We may have outgrown our paperdoll scrapbooks , but there 's no denying that we still love a good ol ' dress-up game . Below , seven Filipino designers who 'd dress our fave Disney girls to perfection !

With writer-director Scott Cooper 's fantastic film Hostiles now available on Blu-ray , a few days ago I spoke with the busy filmmaker about the home video release . During the interview , Cooper talked about his editing process , how he shot the movie chronologically , deleted scenes and why he does n't release them on home video , his accurate depiction of Native Americans , and a lot more . In addition , he talked other projects like his adaptation of Shadow Country that he was working on at HBO with David Milch , Antlers with Guillermo del Toro producing , Hellhound on His Trail about the assassination of Dr. King and the man hunt for James Earl Ray , and more .
If you 're not familiar with the film , Hostiles takes place in 1892 and stars Christian Bale as a legendary Army Captain who reluctantly agrees to escort a dying Cheyenne war chief ( Wes Studi ) and his family back home to the tribal lands . Along the way , they encounter a variety of obstacles including helping a young widow ( Rosamund Pike ) whose family was murdered on the film also stars Adam Bach , Ben Foster , Q'orianka Kilcher , Tanaya Beatty , Jonathan Majors , Rory Cochrane , Jesse Plemons , Timothée Chalamet , Paul Anderson , Ryan Bingham , John Benjamin Hickey , Stephen Lang , and Bill Camp .
Loaded with amazing cinematography , fantastic production design , costumes that feel like they were transported from the era , and great work from all involved , Hostiles is one of those special films that you really want to see . For more on the film , read Adam Chitwood 's review .
SCOTT COOPER : Hey Steve .
Collider : How 're you doing sir ?
COOPER : Oh , doing well thanks . Deep into another screenplay . ( laughs )
I was going to say- is it called Antlers ?
COOPER : Well , that one is being developed with Guillermo . I 've been working on that , as well as the screenplay called Hellhound on His Trail about the assassination of Dr. King and the man hunt for James Earl Ray .
Oh wow . That 's a whole separate thing and now I have about a billion questions .
COOPER : Yes , and very timely I must say . Antlers are something I 'm quite excited about , working with Guillermo . He 's a lovely guy , incredible filmmaker , and a very supportive producer I have to say .
Do you know what you 're going to do next ?
COOPER : Well , I 'm currently developing Antlers- they 're both kind of moving forward in sync- but it feels like Antlers might take the pole position . It 's a more contained feature , and I 'm working with the writers now before I start writing on it . I 'm in the process of really developing that with Guillermo and it 's been a lot of fun- and very different from me . I 'm so influenced early on by the work of John Carpenter on Halloween or certainly The Exorcist , which is a favorite of mine . Or even Tarkovsky 's Stalker . I 'm able to bring all of that into one film . It 's exciting .
It 's always exciting for me when filmmakers are able to bounce from different genres and show different sides of their filmography .
COOPER : Well , it 's interesting . That 's what Guillermo said . That 's the reason he asked me to direct this . He said , “ I 've never seen , obviously , you direct a horror film , but there are a lot of horrific moments in your movies. ” He said , “ So , I 'm more interested in someone who does n't work in that genre to step into it. ” Which does I guess a little bit like Friedkin in a sense- having never directed that genre before he took on The Exorcist . I find that exciting . I 've made my musical of sorts , and my personal film Out of the Furnace , my anti-gangster gangster movie , and then the Western .
I am excited to see your take on it . Also the fact that Guillermo is a great person to work with ; he 's just brilliant .
COOPER : He 's fantastic , so supportive , and wildly imaginative . It 's really been a great collaboration . I 'm very fortunate that he asked me to do this .
So , jumping in to why I get to talk to you- the first time I saw Hostiles was at TIFF and I really enjoyed it . The second time I saw it I absolutely loved it . It 's very rare for me to have such a change . So I 'm going to ask you , when was the last time you saw something that you enjoyed but then the second time you saw it you all of a sudden realized how much you loved it ?
COOPER : I would say Malick 's The Thin Red Line . The first time that I saw the picture…just the scope and use of voice-over narration , and trying to follow so many different characters and then understanding what it was he was trying to say about the film , about the nature of war ; what war does to the individual is something that interests me . It was just a lot to take in for the first time I saw it in the theater . The second time that I saw it , at revival house , I was able to remember what I loved about it , but then was able to relax into the story and understand a bit better what it was he trying to say . I had a very deep , emotional reaction to it , which made me feel James Jones probably would have been very pleased with the adaptation . A really , really , good film , I find- the best films in fact- are not necessarily those who win the Oscar , Steve , but I think the best films are those that reveal something new each time you visit them , and can get better upon repeated viewings , and I think the best films are those that stand the test of time . Even though we feel the necessity to reward movies every year , you really ca n't tell if a film is quite excellent for ten to fifteen years after it comes out .
You 've been to TIFF . I think that when I was at TIFF I had seen just so many movies that it did a disservice to your film because I love it , and the first time it did n't have that- you know what I mean . I saw it in a bad situation .
COOPER : I know , precisely . I mean , Steve , I have heard this on many occasions and what 's unfortunate is that people have to announce what films have arrived , or what films will be nominated , and it does a disservice to certainly the type of film that I try to make . People are all rushing to judge quite quickly . You 're so inundated at Telluride and TIFF and numerous other festivals . Trying to see everything and determine what it is you want to push forward . There are so many films that , I find , often take more patience from the viewer . If you 're running from film , to film , to film , in a very harried festival , it 's not an ideal commission to judge a film . Steve , we do n't make movies to be awarded , we make movies hopefully to learn about ourself- or at least I do .
I completely understand . I 'm obsessed with the editing process because ultimately that 's where every movie comes together . That 's the final rewrite . I 'm curious how long was your first cut of this compared to the finished film .
COOPER : This one , of the four features , was because I shot it chronologically and because the film ca n't be restructured because you 're starting the film in New Mexico and ending it in Montana , and because I shot in locations that would rely on that , if you were to restructure it . It really came together rather quickly . The longer cut was probably 2:40-2:50 . Then , you realize that you just end up having so much material that you thought might be used and might be needed that no longer is . Often there are scenes that are very difficult to let go of . There was one in particular here , but that always happens .
I have n't seen the Blu-ray yet , and I do n't know what you included . Did you include any of the deleted scenes ?
COOPER : You know , I did n't , because I feel like if I had then they should have been in the film . I feel like this is a film , ultimately- I have been fortunate that the four films I put out have been precisely , every edit in the film has been precisely what I 've wanted . So , I 've never really had to compromise . I just felt that that was probably the best way to present the film- with what you saw at TIFF .
I know a lot filmmakers who do n't like including deleted scenes on any Blu-ray and Kubrick was famous for burning the negative . Is it one of these things where the deleted scenes from the movies you 've released will never see the light of day ? Do you have them somewhere and they 're not going to come out ?
COOPER : Yeah , I do , of course . Generally the way I- people think , “ This did not work because the narrative , performance. ” A film takes a certain rhythm . I also find that viewing habits have changed , Steve . I think because of the introduction of our smartphones being completely inundated with stimuli from our news feed and our administration , that people want their films played as quickly as they can . They no longer want to luxuriate in a film while the world slowly crumbles around us . I happen to be the opposite . It 's never really about length or pace , it 's just about whether it 's the best version of the story that I wanted to tell .
I completely understand . I 'm of the opinion , like most cinephiles , that you give me a three hour movie that 's a well-made three hour movie , I 'm all in .
COOPER : Oh , no question . Unfortunately , I just do n't think that people have the patience for that any longer because they 're always checking their Instagram , Twitter , Facebook . I think it does a real disservice to filmmaking . Not long form television because people tend to stream shows that length . They can also , while they 're doing that check their phone , they can pause it when they want to , they can use the bathroom , they can take the dog out , they can text their folks . I much prefer to be in the confines of a darkened cinema where none of that exists and I just luxuriate with the filmmaker and the actors , I 'm trying to say .
I completely get it . This actually brings me to my next point .
COOPER : ( laughs ) I feel like I 'm swimming upstream , Steve .
There 's a reason why so much talent is moving to making long form television- whether it be Netflix , Amazon , whatever the network or streaming service . There are so many people moving to make eight and ten episode series . Scott Frank just did a great thing on Netflix . I 'm just curious if that 's something that interests you ; telling story on one of these streaming services or you know an eight episode series .
COOPER : I 've been asked on many occasions to do [ a TV series ] . The one development in that arena in which I was quite excited was something that was going to reunite Jeff Bridges and me and was being adapted by David Milch , and it was Peter Matthiessen 's opus Shadow Country . And I will say that the writing that Mr. Milch presented me was as masterful as anything I 've ever read . This was set up at HBO , and then there was a regime change and the new regime did n't quite see the merit of what I thought would 've been one of the great cinematic experiences . But those things happen . So I certainly am interested in that because you can tell a story in a manner in which you can greatly develop characters that sometimes is difficult in a two-hour timeframe , and I think that the right piece will come along yet again . But that was something I was quite excited about that Jeff Bridges and David Milch were as well , and I think it would 've been quite exceptional .
I 'm stunned when I hear something like this . The level of talent you just mentioned . Then again , HBO dropped two David Fincher shows , so I 've got no idea what 's going on there .
COOPER : Exactly . I wo n't comment on that , but I will comment on is that it was some of the best writing that I think I 've ever encountered . It came along because I was a longtime fan of the novel , and Mr. Milch asked me to go to lunch and said that he was a big fan of Out Of The Furnace . He thought he would like to write something for me . I said , “ Well , this is it. ” It was incredible .
It 's so crazy . One of the things that I commend you on with the film is the depiction of Native Americans . It just feels honest and feels authentic . Could you talk a little bit about that and the importance of getting it right ?
COOPER : It was critical because if you look at a long line of Western filmmaking , and some of my heroes so often they did n't get it right , to the point where Native Americans were n't even portraying themselves . I wrote this for Wes Studi , Adam Beach , and Q'orianka Kilcher . I spent a lot of time with Chief Phillip of the Northern Cheyenne . I will say that although this film has been received by my peers and the people that I care about most in ways that I could only have dreamed of , it was the experience of showing this film to the Cheyenne Nation in Montana- many of whom had never been off the reservation . To see the reaction , the warm reception , that the film received . The native community , largely , has been extremely supportive . For me that 's the biggest reward because I want to tell their story about this dark and unforgivable past of American genocide . I was very , very moved when the Native community embraced the film the way that they did . It was critical for me to get it right . I worked every day with Native American advisors that were on the set when we were shooting , working with language , costumes , and their culture . Same with the Comanche that opened the film . Quanah Parker 's distant relative was there helping me . He said I did n't quite go far enough with the violence in the opening in the film . I felt like what I showed was quite enough , but in the end it 's very heartening to have him really love the film .
That 's so funny to hear that it was n't violent enough because for some people I think is very violent .
COOPER : I really do n't condone violence and I ca n't watch these Youtube videos where violence takes place . What I am really interested in is the effect violence has on people around the world . You hope that people can see it depicted in a way in which I depicted it ; that does n't desensitize violence or dehumanize violence but shows how negative the consequences are . Hopefully that will play some small part stopping further violence . There are far more violent things on television and gratuitous violence that I ever tend to or ever want to see .
Rep. Jeff Denham ( R-Turlock ) said Monday night that he would n't support his party 's healthcare legislation unless it left significant parts of Obamacare intact .
`` I 've expressed to leadership that I 'm a 'no ' on the health care vote until it is responsive to my community , '' he said during a town hall meeting with hundreds of voters in his district .
`` There are things in the Affordable Care Act we expect to stay , '' Denham added , such as coverage for pre-existing conditions and expanded Medicaid coverage .
Denham had previously expressed concerns about Republican legislation to roll back the Affordable Care Act , emphasizing that residents in his Central Valley district struggle to find doctors . The legislation was withdrawn after the party failed to resolve internal disputes between moderates and conservatives .
Restless members of the crowd frequently interrupted Denham , who won his fourth congressional term in November . Asked if he believes that climate change is real , voters chanted `` yes or no ? '' until he answered .
`` Yes , I believe in climate change , '' Denham said .
Despite a less-than-stellar budget scenario for Burbank schools next academic year — which could mean $ 2.7 million less for the district than anticipated — officials have started discussing how they can expand instrumental , dance and theater programs over the next three years .
While speaking about the budget for next year , Larry Applebaum , school board president , said , `` only time will tell '' as they wait for state officials to adopt their budget in June .
In the meantime , any anticipated funding limitations wo n't stop local school officials from drafting a plan to restore music and arts programs across the district .
Join the conversation on Facebook > >
Earlier this school year , Peggy Flynn , the district 's arts and career technical education coordinator , and Daniel Swartz , a teacher on special assignment for arts and career-technical education , teamed up to produce a report to guide spending decisions .
The Burbank school board discussed the report for the first time last week during a special study session where Supt . Matt Hill said Flynn and Swartz put in `` countless hours '' on the plan .
`` We 've had fierce conversations and debates about these options , '' he said .
Some of the major points in the report detail ways the district can provide music instruction for all elementary grades , expand instrumental music to all fourth- and fifth-graders , and add orchestra programs at three schools that now have only banded — David Starr Jordan and Luther Burbank middle schools and John Burroughs High School .
Adding strings programs at those three schools would cost at least $ 208,000 , according to the report .
Overall , music programs differ at each of the elementary schools , with many funded in varying amounts by parent donations , booster clubs , grants or nonprofit organizations .
In 2007 , Burbank school officials set out to restore district-funded music instruction that had been cut at the elementary level .
Now , the district pays for five instructors to teach weekly general music classes to students in second through fifth grades , but officials want to provide music instruction to students in junior kindergarten , kindergarten and first grade , too .
The cost to hire a credentialed music teacher would cost an estimated $ 83,000 per year , as opposed to $ 42,000 to bring on a non-credentialed music consultant , according to the report .
One suggestion for adding instrumental instruction in the fourth and fifth grades would have the district spend at least $ 22,000 for ukuleles .
Flynn and Swartz also took a meticulous inventory of every instrument across the district 's 20 schools , and , in the process , unearthed in a closet a stash of violins that had gone missing about a decade ago .
The inventory comes with estimated costs for maintaining the thousands of instruments each year , notes their lifespan and which ones should be replaced . Flynn and Swartz recommended using a digital database to keep inventory up-to-date .
The school board could take action on some suggestions in May .
That 's when school officials may also opt to give more training opportunities to its current physical education instructors to teach dance in the middle schools , which local P.E . instructors already provide as part of the state 's physical education standards , but additional training would enhance the dance instruction .
It 's also expected that new drama and theater courses will begin at Luther and Jordan middle schools — two of the three middle schools that do n't currently offer those classes — this fall .

President Donald Trump on Tuesday said North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un has been `` very open '' and `` very honorable , '' and wants an historic , high-stakes meeting as soon as possible .

This is a sharp break from the American president 's previous denunciations of Kim Jong-un as `` Little Rocket Man . ''
The United States and North Korea have been negotiating a summit between Trump and Kim Jong-un to be held in May or June to broker a deal on Pyongyang 's nuclear ambitions . Trump , who has struck a decidedly optimistic tone on the situation in recent days , said Tuesday that the United States and North Korea were having `` good discussions . ''
`` We have been told directly that they would like to have the meeting as soon as possible . We think that 's a great thing for the world , '' Trump said at the White House alongside French President Emmanuel Macron . `` Kim Jong-un , he really has been very open and I think very honorable from everything we 're seeing . ''
Trump cautioned that North Korea had not followed through on previous promises , but credited tough steps from his administration — including sanctions and organizing pressure from international allies — for having forced Pyongyang to hold talks . And he again suggested that he would `` leave the table '' if they negotiations were not productive or if North Korea was not operating in good faith .
`` We 'll see where that all goes , '' the president said . `` Maybe it will be wonderful or maybe it wo n't . ''
Trump 's comments came days after a flurry of signs from North Korea that the White House was anxious to promote as signs that its coercion campaign was working . On Saturday , North Korea announced it will close its nuclear testing facility and suspend nuclear and intercontinental ballistic missile tests — a move welcomed by Trump as `` big progress . ''
However , the North stopped short of suggesting it will give up its nuclear weapons — as Trump suggested in a tweet — or scale back its production of missiles and their related components .
Asked if the suspension of tests was a positive sign , Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said Monday , `` Right now , I think there ( are ) a lot of reasons for optimism that the negotiations will be fruitful and we 'll see . ''
This week , U.S.-allied South Korean President Moon Jae-in and Kim will hold a summit in the demilitarized zone between the Koreas that could lay the ground for Trump 's planned meeting with the North Korean dictator . The leaders of the U.S. and North Korea have never met during six decades of hostility since the Korean War .
The exact date and location of the possible summit has not been determined .
White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Monday that the U.S. goal was the complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula . When asked if the president was willing to accept anything short of that goal before lifting sanctions or was willing to go incrementally , she told reporters : `` Certainly no sanctions lifted until we see concrete actions taken by North Korea to denuclearize . ''
Last year , the U.S. spearheaded through the U.N. Security Council the toughest international sanctions yet against North Korea in response to three long-range missile launches and its most powerful nuclear test explosion yet . The Trump administration supplemented those restrictions with unilateral U.S. sanctions against firms that had conducted illicit trade with the North .
This year , Kim has pivoted from confrontation to diplomacy and , according to South Korea and China , has expressed a commitment to denuclearization . There is still uncertainty about what he seeks in return .
Trump 's praise for Kim Jong-un on Tuesday stood in stark contrast to his previous bellicose rhetoric toward the North Korean leader . Beyond dubbing him `` Little Rocket Man '' from the rostrum of the United Nations last fall , Trump has threatened to deliver `` fire and fury '' upon North Korea and taunted Kim Jong-un on Twitter that his nuclear `` button '' was larger than the one in Pyongyang .

After disgraced National Security Adviser Michael Flynn pleaded guilty to the FBI and agreed to cooperate with Robert Mueller 's investigation , there 's been much speculation that the special counsel is using the “ Logan Act ” as leverage in his dealing with potential witnesses .
Let 's hope not . No one has ever been found guilty of violating it since Congress passed the law in 1799 . But that fact , which is circulating widely in the media , is a distraction . Far more concerning is another fact about the Logan Act : It has been repeatedly used as a partisan cudgel to harass political opponents for more than two American centuries . If Mueller makes this obscure law the centerpiece of his case against the Trump administration , he runs the risk of inviting accusations , however unfounded , that he , too , is a partisan hack .
The idea behind the Logan Act is not without merit . It forbids Americans from unauthorized negotiations with foreign governments , especially those that seek to “ defeat the measures of the United States ” aimed at those same countries . In short , it protects the ability of the U.S. government to conduct foreign policy without interference from private citizens .
It originated in the late 1790s . After the U.S. signed a treaty with Great Britain , France retaliated by preying on American shipping . The resulting “ Quasi-War ” put France on a collision course with President John Adams and the Federalist Party . They had little love for the country after witnessing the bloody excesses of the French Revolution .
But the political opposition , led by Thomas Jefferson and the Democratic Republican Party , retained a strong affection for France . In 1798 , Dr. George Logan of Philadelphia , a friend of Jefferson , traveled to Paris for talks with French officials aimed at defusing the conflict . This end run around Federalist foreign policy met with immediate condemnation .
President Adams asked Congress to put an end to the “ temerity and impertinence of individuals affecting to interfere in public affairs between France and the United States. ” Representative Roger Griswold , a Federalist from Connecticut , happily complied , and Congress passed the Logan Act in 1799 .
This same Congress also passed the odious Alien and Sedition Acts , which targeted Jefferson and his followers . And almost immediately , one legal scholar has observed , the statute “ revealed its potential as a principle of political behavior , as a debating weapon against the opposition and as a threat against those out of power. ” But as a law actually used to prosecute rogue diplomats ? Not so much .
In fact , the only person formally indicted under the Logan Act was an eccentric Kentucky farmer named Francis Flournoy , who advocated that his state secede and throw their lot with France . This was hardly a diplomatic overture , but after betraying French sympathies , Kentucky 's U.S. Attorney , an Adams appointee and staunch Federalist , slapped him with an indictment under the Logan Act . The case never made it to trial .
From that point forward , plenty of politicians brandished the Logan Act , but they never took anyone to trial , much less indicted them . This was true even in the Civil War , when Northerners sympathetic to the Confederacy reached out to the British government , asking it to intervene on behalf of the secessionist South . Judges tried to coax grand juries to prosecute these individuals under the Logan Act , but failed to secure indictments .
Though politicians occasionally invoked the Logan Act during the Gilded Age , it was in the twentieth century that it became a reliable , if infrequently used , political weapon . In the election year of 1920 , Republican Warren G. Harding sought to appear more presidential by claiming that he had been in touch with a French diplomat about the fate of the League of Nations . Such presumption earned him a nasty letter from President Woodrow Wilson .
In 1927 , Republican Senator William Borah , who chaired the Committee on Foreign Relations , wrote to the president of Mexico about a statistical matter involving the nationalization of land . Democrats seized on this misstep , alleging that Borah had violated the Logan Act .
Republicans returned the favor in 1933 , claiming that Democrat William Bullitt was “ flitting around Europe ” consulting with European leaders about unpaid war debts before Roosevelt 's formal inauguration . One Republican senator demanded Bullitt 's arrest and prosecution under the Logan Act . Again , nothing happened , and Roosevelt promptly appointed Bullitt ambassador to the Soviet Union .
Occasionally both Republicans and Democrats found common ground under the Logan Act . In 1947 , former vice president Henry Wallace , a Democrat , visited Europe and made speeches that denounced the “ Truman Doctrine. ” Politicians from both sides of the aisle called for his head , arguing that he had violated the Logan Act . But in general , the Logan Act remained a partisan weapon during the Cold War . During the Vietnam War , Jane Fonda , Ramsey Clark , and other visitors to Hanoi prompted calls that they be prosecuted under the Logan Act .
Newt Gingrich revived the tactic in the 1980s , after Democrats in Congress wrote an open letter to the leadership of Nicaragua encouraging them to accept the contras as political participants . This echoed what the Reagan administration had already demanded , but Gingrich still decried it as “ a virtual teaching document to bring Third World Soviet colonies into the process of manipulating American politics and politicians . ”
Since that time , both Republicans and Democrats periodically rummage through their political arsenals , rediscover the Logan Act , and brandish it each other like some kind of magical fetish .
This happened most recently after Democrats began accusing Trump of Logan Act violations in the summer of 2016 . It was immediately after the Republican convention , when Trump publicly urged Russia to find Hillary 's Clinton 's missing emails . “ That 's not legal , ” Tom Vilsack , President Barack Obama 's secretary of agriculture , said the next day . Democratic Senator Claire McCaskill agreed . “ I believe it violates the Logan Act , ” McCaskill said , “ and I think he should be investigated for that . ”
Earlier , Democrats assailed a group of Republicans for writing an open letter to Iran over the future of the nuclear agreement brokered by Obama . The Obama administration did n't press the issue , and in fact , no one ever gets the ball rolling on an indictment tied to the Logan Act , much less a conviction . That 's because the law has never had much to do with crime and punishment . It was born a political weapon and has remained one ever since .
For Mueller 's work to be taken seriously by the American people , it must remain above politics . Leaving the Logan Act to the politicians will help keep it that way .

Ed Sachse , 56 , has toiled in the real estate field since he started a window-washing business as a teen in Detroit . Today he is president of property services for Kennedy Wilson , overseeing its brokers and 21 million square feet of retail , office , industrial and apartment properties across the U.S. from the firm 's Beverly Hills headquarters .
Freezing in Michigan
As a 15-year-old high school student in the 1970s , Sachse ( pronounced “ saxy ” ) and a friend with a car paid $ 400 for a window-washing business that served strip malls . They learned the importance of working quickly when , in the winter , the washing solution would freeze on the windows if they did n't wipe it off fast enough .
They expanded their business by knocking on doors and handing out cards . The experience proved formative for his future as an entrepreneur .
“ We made a lot more money washing windows than all of our friends with part-time jobs in gas stations and supermarkets , ” he said . “ And we learned you have to expect the unexpected and roll with the changes when you run your own business . It was a constant adventure . ”
Head for numbers
At Michigan State University , Sachse learned he had a knack for accounting . Degree in hand , he went to work as an accountant for industry giant Arthur Andersen , serving clients such as Domino 's Pizza Inc. and the Detroit Tigers . He found the profession exciting but draining .
“ I was burned out after the third tax season , ” he said . “ I took a vacation to Santa Monica to get out of Detroit for a week and met a blond-haired , blue-eyed hottie named Julie , who is my wife today , ” he said .
He moved to Los Angeles and found accounting work with commercial property landlord Douglas Emmett Inc . He was rapidly promoted to chief financial officer of the landlord 's mortgage banking company , Camden Financial .
Beyond accounting
Soon , however , “ I had an itch to do something different , ” Sachse said . “ I wanted to learn the city and do deals . ”
That led to a job as a broker at Coldwell Banker , the commercial property brokerage now called CBRE Group Inc. His first big challenge was to sell an empty school , so he flipped through the Yellow Pages looking for prospects .
“ Religious schools have money , so I started calling all the religious schools , ” he said .
He got a nibble from Rabbi Marvin Hier , founder of the Simon Wiesenthal Center , who brought his assistants to check out the school one Sunday . Hier seemed interested in a basketball court , so Sachse grabbed a ball while Hier 's crew went to work .
“ On my first proper building tour , I found myself playing ‘ horse ' with the rabbi while his group did the inspections , ” he said . Hier 's organization bought the building , and Sachse 's career as a broker took off .

We made a lot more money washing windows than all of our friends with part-time jobs in gas stations and supermarkets . Ed Sasche , president of property services for Kennedy Wilson
On his own
Sasche eased into property management unintentionally when a client who owned a strip mall had trouble leasing empty space in part because the parking lot was unkempt and packed with employees ' vehicles .
He cleaned up the lot , got workers to park elsewhere and helped the landlord collect overdue rent from the mall 's largest tenant . His success at improving the center 's performance prompted him to start his own property management and brokerage company in 1993 , even though the country had just suffered through a recession and the real estate industry was in a trough .
“ I figured that if I can make it in a bad market , ” Sasche said , “ I can make it in any market . ”
A hammer falls
Sachse 's business rode up with the improving economy in the '90s , but his world broke apart in 2001 .
“ Out of the blue , at age 41 , I was diagnosed with stage 4 non-Hodgkin lymphoma , ” he said . “ I had tumors in my spine , liver and spleen , and it was difficult to walk . ”
He battled the disease for the next six years while trying to keep his business afloat , dashing to the hospital for blood transfusions and enduring a bone marrow transplant and two stem cell transplants .
At one point he could n't talk but managed to negotiate a 30,000-square-foot office lease .
“ I would lie on my back in the hospital with my phone three inches from my nose typing emails , ” he said . “ With the help of my team we ended up closing the deal , and I never spoke a word . ”
Another , bigger recession
The Great Recession brought Sachse 's business to its knees with cutbacks and layoffs . Determined not to go under , in late 2009 he made a list of 40 contacts he might get new business from and called on each of them in the hope 2010 would be better .
One of his visits was to Kennedy Wilson , where he said , “ Give me your worst property to sell or lease . I want to show you how good we are . ”
Instead , Kennedy Wilson offered to buy his company . After talking it over with his wife , Sachse agreed to the acquisition . Since then he has overseen brokerage and property management for Kennedy Wilson .
Outside the office
Ed and Julie Sachse live in Pacific Palisades and have two grown children . Ed is a hockey fan who shares a birthday with Red Wings star Gordie Howe .
His “ biggest passion , ” he said , is playing rock-and-roll on his guitar . He and his friends have a garage band that performs occasionally , usually at their own parties .
“ Every time we play together , ” he joked , “ it costs us money . ”

An analyst who wrote his master 's thesis on Vancouver 's taxi industry says he was not surprised after a video surfaced showing a taxi driver refusing to take a passenger to New Westminster .
Benn Proctor , who 's currently an analyst with the Wilson Center in Washington D.C. , says taxi lobbyists are to blame , as they have done a good job keeping cab demand high .
READ MORE : Vancouver taxi driver refuses to drive man home because New Westminster is ‘ too far '
“ When you 're at times of peak demand – so Christmas season when the parties are going and when people want to take cabs – and there are not enough of them around , taxi drivers will often refuse rides , ” said Proctor .
“ They know it 's more profitable to get the next guy , keep trips [ and ] stay in the area . ”

Politicians have n't done enough to make regulations around the industry more consumer-friendly , said Proctor .
He says passengers are losing out because of the limited amount of taxi licenses and the province is keeping its foot on the brake when it comes to ride-hailing services .

The video put the taxi industry back under the microscope . The driver shown in the video has since been suspended .

Soini reiterated his widely documented opposition to abortion in his personal blog after the Irish voted overwhelmingly – by 66.4 per cent to 33.6 per cent – in favour of a proposal to repeal a constitutional ban on abortion in a referendum on Friday , 25 May .
Timo Soini ( BR ) , the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Finland , received no support for his views on abortion from his fellow cabinet members .
“ The world is becoming stranger indeed if you need to justify yourself for defending life . I do defend it , however , in both the appropriate and inappropriate moment . A well of dirty water . It may look good , but it tastes bad , ” he phrased on Sunday .
His blog post prompted a handful of opposition members to ask the government to clarify its position on the issue .
Kai Mykkänen ( NCP ) , the Minister of the Interior , responded to such questions by assuring that the views of Soini do not reflect the official position of the Finnish government .
“ As the minister for international development , I increased funding for sexual and mental health and for support related to reproductive rights , including the possibility of safe abortion in developing countries , ” he tweeted on Monday .
“ This is precisely how it is , ” confirmed Anne Virolainen ( NCP ) , the current Minister for International Trade and Development . “ Finland has drawn attention to sexual and mental health and reproductive rights in all contexts – most recently in a meeting of development ministers on Tuesday . The right to abortion is not a matter of opinion . It is a matter of human rights . ”

NEW DELHI - India hopes to make history by launching a record 104 satellites from a single rocket Wednesday as its famously frugal space agency looks to zoom ahead in the commercial space race .
The rocket is set to blast off from the southern spaceport of Sriharikota , India 's Space Research Organisation ( ISRO ) said in a statement on Tuesday .
The Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle would be carrying a 714 kilogram main satellite for earth observation and 103 smaller `` nano satellites '' which would weigh a combined 664 kilograms . Nearly all of the nano satellites are from other countries , including Israel , Kazakhstan , The Netherlands , Switzerland , United Arab Emirates and 96 from the United States , said the state-run ISRO .
If successful , India will set a world record as the first country to launch the most satellites in one go , surpassing Russia which launched 39 satellites in a single mission in June 2014 . The business of putting commercial satellites into space for a fee is growing as phone , Internet and other companies , as well as countries , seek greater and more high-tech communications .
India is competing with other international players for a greater share of that launch market , and is known for its low-cost space programme . Last June , India set a national record after it successfully launched a rocket carrying 20 satellites , including 13 from the US .
It sent an unmanned rocket to orbit Mars in 2013 at a cost of just $ 73 million , compared with NASA 's Maven Mars mission which had a $ 671 million price tag . ISRO is also mulling the idea of missions to Jupiter and Venus .
Prime Minister Narendra Modi has often hailed India 's budget space technology , quipping in 2014 that a rocket that launched four foreign satellites into orbit had cost less to make than Hollywood film `` Gravity '' .
HP and its Global Chief Marketing and Communication Officer , Antonio Lucio , have been on a mission since 2016 to advance diversity and inclusion in the industry , and the hard work is paying off .
In a year after launching its diversity initiative , Brand Monitor showed a six-point uptick in purchase intent for HP and HP Business drivers , and Marketing Mix Analysis , run by Nielsen , revealed a 33 percent increase in revenue per impression .
Also after working with the Association of National Advertisers to apply the group 's # SeeHer Gender Equality Measurement methodology to the brand 's ads , HP saw a five-point jump in effectiveness .
`` After all the negative talk about our industry , I 'm beginning to feel that this movement is alive and well , and that agencies , productions companies and marketers are beginning to get it , and there is holistic and systemic progress around diversity and inclusion , and not just around values , but that it 's good for business , '' said Lucio .
When Lucio first started his diversity push , he set targets for all HP agency partners around the number of women and people of color working on the business . The marketer 's top five roster agencies - BBDO Worldwide , Fred & Farid , gyro , PHD and Edelman - saw a 20-point increase in women in creative and account leadership roles .
HP was also the first sponsor of Free the Bid , an initiative focused on getting more female directors behind the camera . Before signing on , none of HP 's work was directed by women , but since joining , 59 percent of the brand 's global campaign films have been directed by women , all whom are Free the Bid directors .
Lucio also praised the fact that Free the Bid Founder Alma Har'el has increased the hiring and bidding of female directors by 400 percent across the industry . `` That 's the power of committed people driving change , '' he said .
On the people of color front , Lucio said one of the problems HP 's agencies identified was pipeline , so the marketer decided to help solve that with its # MoreLikeMe initiative , in partnership with Cannes Lions .
The program , Lucio said , is aimed at helping to build the talent of racially and ethnically diverse creatives with five to 10 years of experience . Participants submitted their portfolios and wrote an essay about why diversity was important to them . Each roster agency selected three people to participate .
Facebook also nominated three participants from the industry – alumni of the 4A 's Multicultural Advertising Internship Program – to join # MoreLikeMe . All participants will attend the Cannes Lions Festival of Creativity this year and join HP 's events . Facebook is further getting involved by sponsoring an Instagram Story School for the year-long program , offering mentorship opportunities and hosting a session on Facebook 's beach at Cannes .
Lucio , who is holding a mainstage session at Cannes called `` Diversity – A Values Issue and Business Imperative – Requires Bold Action , '' added that HP has signed a partnership with The Female Quotient . Together , HP and TFQ are working to create and implement an algorithm to measure inclusion-related issues at companies , he said . The duo 's first event will be held at TFQ 's The Girls ' Lounge in Cannes .
The # MoreLikeMe pilot program participants include :

RIO DE JANEIRO/São Paulo ( Reuters ) - A 72-hour strike by Brazilian oil workers halted refineries and rigs on Wednesday , union leaders said , a new blow to President Michel Temer on the heels of a trucker protest that has strangled Latin America 's largest economy for over a week .
The strike by workers demanding changes at state-led oil firm Petroleo Brasileiro SA is the latest challenge for the company known as Petrobras , whose shares have tumbled nearly 30 percent in two weeks over fears that political interference would unwind recent investor-focused policies .
The economic and political storm has shaken the lame duck Temer government ahead of October elections and rattled nerves about the path forward for Petrobras , Latin America 's biggest producer of crude .
It has also raised the spectre of protests spreading to more sectors as Brazilians vent frustration with the unpopular government and an uneven economic recovery .
With truckers protesting over high fuel prices , government sources told Reuters late on Tuesday that Temer had been considering scrapping a market-based fuel pricing policy at Petrobras . But by Wednesday morning the president 's office issued a statement saying he would preserve the policy .
The oil sector strike included workers on at least 25 of the total 46 oil rigs Petrobras operates in the lucrative Campos basin , responsible for nearly half of Brazil 's petroleum production . FUP , Brazil 's largest oil workers ' union , said that seven of those rigs were paralysed . Petrobras did not respond to requests for confirmation .
Petrobras said before the strike that the disruptions would not have an immediate major impact on its output or overall operations . Brazil produces about 2.1 million barrels of oil per day .
According to a source close to the company , Petrobras has a significant stock of fuel on hand , especially as the 10-day trucker protest prevented significant amounts of fuel from leaving refineries .
The truckers ' highway blockades and resulting fuel shortages have already halted major industries and hammered exports of everything from beef and soybeans to coffee and cars .
FUP said on Wednesday that workers did not show up to work at 10 refineries stretching from Manaus in the Amazon to Rio de Janeiro in the southeast . They also walked off the job at plants handling lubricants , nitrogen and shale gas , as well as in the ports of Suape and Paranagua .
The oil strike was declared illegal by Brazil 's top labour court late Tuesday , after Petrobras argued it was about politics rather than labour issues . FUP union leader Jose Maria Rangel said by phone from Rio de Janeiro on Wednesday the union `` will not be intimidated '' by judicial decisions , and called the three-day strike a `` warning . ''
`` Our members have already approved us declaring a strike without a fixed end date , '' the union said , without providing details on when any longer stoppage may take place .
TARGETING PARENTE
Unions representing oil workers said they were demanding the resignation of Petrobras chief executive Pedro Parente . They also want the end of the market-based fuel pricing policy and other changes made at Petrobras since Temer took power in 2016 .
Petrobras said on Wednesday that board member José Alberto de Paula Torres Lima had resigned , citing `` personal reasons . '' He was one of three board members recruited by an outside agency and added to the board in April in an effort to establish its independence .
Petrobras did not respond to questions about his departure .
FUP union leader Rangel said the Temer government and Parente 's policies were delivering Petrobras up to foreign investors , while `` the shipyards of Rio de Janeiro are closed '' as unemployment remains near record levels .
Parente , on a Tuesday conference call with analysts , said Petrobras was taking action so that any strike would have minimal or no impact on production and operations . The company flexed its muscles a bit by announcing on Wednesday that it would raise gasoline prices at refineries by 0.7 percent starting Thursday .
The separate 10-day trucker protest against diesel price hikes has left major cities running short on food , gasoline and medical supplies , despite significantly easing on Tuesday night .
Officials warned it would take days to restore supply lines disrupted by the stoppage that at its height saw over 1,000 roadblocks on highways across the country .
Moody 's Investor Service warned that it will take weeks for operations to return to normal in sectors from meatpackers and automakers to airlines and retail .

Stavanger : Former world champion Viswanathan Anand will take on Hikaru Nakamura of the United States in the seventh round of Altibox Norway Chess tournament .
After a rather slow start that cost him two losses in the first five rounds , Anand rose back in style defeating Fabiano Caruana of the United States in the previous round .
Nakamura and Levon Aronian of Armenia are leading the tournament with four points each , a full point clear of Russian duo of Vladimir Kramnik and Sergey Karjakin , Anish Giri of Holland and Wesley So of the United States .
Anand shares the seventh spot in the ten-player round-robin tournament alongside world champion Magnus Carlsen of Norway , Maxime Vachier-Lagrave of France and Caruana who all have 2.5 points apiece .
In the last three remaining games , Anand gets two white and one black which might just help the Indian ace to turn the tide in his favour . After the white game against Nakamura , Anand will play with black against Aronian and in the final round he will again have white against Carlsen .
The world champion has been clearly struggling on his home turf and time might already be running out for him .
Magnus Carlsen is still looking for his first victory in the tournament and is yet to show an impressive display .
Aronian , with a scalp of two former world champions , has done quite well . Inflicting a loss to Carlsen , the Armenian followed it up with a victory against Kramnik in the previous round and he seems to be the man-in-form . Much would depend on how things shape up in his game against Anand .
Nakamura started with a victory and has been in sole or shared lead right from the first day . However , his ambitious approach along with complex play could either make him a runaway winner or he may miss out on the top spot .
Pairing round 7 : V Anand ( Ind , 2.5 ) v Hikaru Nakamura ( Usa , 4 ) ; Vladimir Kramnik ( Rus , 3 ) v Magnus Carlsen ( Nor , 2.5 ) , Maxime Vachier-Lagrave ( Fra , 2.5 ) v Anish Giri ( Ned , 3 ) ; Sergey Karjakin ( Rus , 3 ) v Levon Aronian ( Arm , 4 ) ; Wesley So ( Usa , 3 ) v Fabiano Caruana ( Usa , 2.5 ) .
Saskatchewan farmer Gerald Stanley did not appear in North Battleford court Monday to answer to improper storage of gun charges , though he was n't required to be present .

Stanley was charged by RCMP in November 2016 with two counts of unsafe storage of firearms .
The charges were laid following the fatal shooting of Colten Boushie , 22 , in July 2016 .
According to attorney Mark Brayford , who is not associated with the case , Stanley could face a maximum jail term of five years , but that is highly unlikely .
Brayford said a conditional discharge is the most common penalty .
“ If you get a conditional discharge , you are being convicted , but if you comply with the terms of probation , typically for about a year , then you would not have a criminal record thereafter , ” Brayford said .
Brayford added the accused is often given a conditional discharge if they have no prior convictions .
Stanley could also face a fine or a firearms probation .

Turkey 's natural gas import through Trans-Anatolian Natural Gas Pipeline ( TANAP ) will be much cheaper compared to all the other sources , Vagif Aliyev , Turkey chairman of State Oil Company of the Azerbaijan Republic ( SOCAR ) said yesterday .
`` The price for gas from Shah Deniz-1 Gas Field will be different from that of Shah Deniz-2 gas , which will come to Turkey via TANAP .
`` The gas prices for BOTAŞ are , of course , a commercial secret , but I can say that TANAP gas will be the cheapest , '' Aliyev said .
On the sideline of the 25th Caspian Oil and Gas Conference in Baku , SOCAR Turkey chairman said that the Southern Gas Corridor ( SGC ) consists of different projects complementing each other .
Noting that the first stage of the Southern Gas Corridor inaugurated Tuesday - is the off-shore production in the Shah Deniz-2 field , he said the natural gas brought from Sangachal terminal to the Baku-Turkey border via pipelines is linked to the TANAP on the Georgia-Turkey border .
Aliyev said that the investment decision on the Southern Gas Corridor project was taken at the end of 2013 and that the foundation was laid in September 2014 , adding that in the three years and eight months period , the 820 kilometer pipeline between Azerbaijan and Georgia and the 1,300 kilometers part of 1,850 km TANAP to Eskişehir was competed .
He stressed that the first commercial gas will be given to BOTAŞ system on June 30 via TANAP , which will be officially opened in Eskişehir on June 12 , and that the gas volume will increase from 2 billion cubic meters ( bcm ) in the first year to 6 bcm by 2020 .
Noting that thus , the total amount of gas Turkey imports from Azerbaijan , including from Shah Deniz-1 and Shah Deniz-2 fields , will exceed 12 bcm by 2020 , Aliyev said the total capacity of the current TANAP is 16 billion cubic meters , while 10 billion cubic meters of this will be exported to Europe from 2020 .
`` The capacity of the pipeline is likely to increase to 31 billion cubic meters in the future with additional compressor investments . We have other offshore resources for this , and we are working on them , but it is not necessary for this additional gas to be Azeri gas . It could be Iranian or Iraqi gas as well . This pipeline is not just a project for our own gas , it is a strategic investment , '' He continued .
He pointed out that TANAP is their biggest projects abroad , recalling that they were partners with SOCAR , BOTAŞ and British Petroleum ( BP ) when investment decision was made at the end of 2013 .
The SOCAR Turkey chairman said that the investment was forecasted at $ 11.7 billion and that TANAP 's investment cost has fallen to $ 8 billion , achieving a very good saving . Regarding the reasons for the cost reductions and details of the partnership in the project , he said the first reason for cost reduction is good management of the project , reminding that in 2011-2012 , oil prices fell , and related steel pipe production and business values were lower .
`` We appreciated them well . Machine equipment prices also declined . We could get better prices here as well , '' Aliyev said , listing the second reason as the definite completion of the commercial agreements of the gas sold to Turkey .
`` BOTAŞ is an investor partner in the TANAP , but also a customer and a buyer of the gas producers of Shah Deniz-2 field . The price of Shah Deniz-1 gas is different from that of Shah Deniz-2 gas coming via TANAP , '' Aliyev said . `` BOTAS 's gas prices are , of course , a commercial secret , but I can say that TANAP gas is the cheapest gas among other imported sources . ''
He also stated that Turkish Petroleum Corporation ( TPAO ) has 19 percent partnership in production in Shah Deniz-1 and Shah Deniz-2 fields with the same proportion of partnerships in the pipeline between Baku and Turkey , but BOTAS does not have any partnership on the production side .
Aliyev underlined that this year is very important for SOCAR Turkey and that they successfully realized the investment decisions taken 3-4 years ago .
He stated that , besides TANAP , they are also counting days for the commissioning of the STAR Refinery , which was built in İzmir Aliağa Peninsula with an investment size of $ 6.3 billion .
`` We are now in the phase of commissioning units . After bringing the first oil cargo in June , we will proceed and have the refinery commissioned by the end of September or the first half of October with an official ceremony , '' Aliyev noted . `` Including TANAP , we are commissioning our giant projects amounting to $ 14.5 billion this year . These projects are considered as the largest investments in the real sector in Turkey in recent years . ''
Meanwhile , it was reported that TANAP 's contract was signed with the commitment that the price of natural gas will be cheaper than gas coming from Russia .
In the recent past , the Indian Government has been proactive in encouraging startups , and according to the ‘ Ease of Doing Business Index of 2018 ' created by the World Bank , India currently ranks 100 out of 190 countries . T shows how easy or difficult it is for an entrepreneur to open and run a small to medium-size business when complying with relevant regulations . It measures and tracks changes in regulations affecting 11 areas in the life cycle of a business : starting a business , dealing with construction permits , getting electricity , registering property , getting credit , protecting minority investors , paying taxes , trading across borders , enforcing contracts , resolving insolvency and labour market regulation .
India 's rank has significantly improved due to various reforms that have been brought about by the current Government , including setting up of the Atal Innovation Mission and NITI Aayog . Several benefits for eligible startups have been provided by the Indian government , including but not limited to compliance regime based on self-certification , providing legal support and fast-tracking patent examination at lower costs , relaxed norms for public procurement , tax exemption on capital gains , tax exemption for three years , providing funding support , and separate institutional trading platforms have been provided by stock exchanges for listing of startups .
It is often felt that startups face numerous legal and regulatory challenges in order to grow into successful organizations .
Here are five key legal and regulatory considerations which startups need to consider before doing business in India :
Business structure : In India , a startup business may be set up either as a limited liability partnership or as a private limited company depending on the nature of the business , tax efficiency , corporate flexibility , cost of formation , compliance requirements and so on . Typically , we have seen that startups in India prefer incorporating a private limited company as it is easier to raise funds from investors .
Licenses and registrations : There are a number of licenses and registrations which are required to be obtained in order to carry out business in India depending on the nature of business of the startup and the entity that is incorporated i.e . Permanent Account Number ( PAN ) , Importer Exporter Code ( IEC ) , Tax Deduction and Collection Account Number ( TAN ) , Goods and Service Tax ( GST ) , Shops and Commercial Establishment certificate , employment related registrations depending on the number of employees , certificate from the Inter-Ministerial Board of Certification ( IMBC ) for tax benefits and so on .
Intellectual Property ( IP ) : For most technology-centric startups , IP is very important . IP includes copyright , trademarks , patents , design , software development codes , programs , research findings , algorithms etc . and it is imperative that a startup protects these effectively from the very beginning as IP rights may also be licensed and/or sold and thus have financial implications as well .
Contract management : A startup would need to enter into various written contracts to make them legally binding and enforceable , i.e . service agreements with vendors , distribution agreements with distributors , employment agreements with employees , consultancy agreements with consultants , non-disclosure agreement ( NDA ) with various third parties for protection of confidential information , leave and license or lease agreements for use of premises , shareholder agreements ( including subscription agreements and/or share transfer agreements ) with investors , partnership agreement between partners , IP-related agreements for protection or assignment of IP , etc . As a startup should ideally try to mitigate risks which it may face from any commercial arrangement that it would be entering into , it is essential that these agreements are not one side and are negotiated properly . Also , startups should keep in mind that most agreements need to be stamped and registered ( if required ) prior to execution .
Compliance requirements : There are a number of reporting requirements that a startup would need to comply with depending on the nature of the entity that is incorporated and the investment that is made . In the event that the entity is a company , various filings/reportings would need to be made with the relevant registrar of companies and the company would have to comply with the Indian Companies Act , 2013 ( including with respect to number of members , directors , shareholder meetings , board meetings , quorum for meetings , annual filings etc. ) . In the event the entity is a limited liability partnership , then various filings/reportings would need to be made with the relevant registrar of companies and the partnership would have to comply with the Limited Liability Partnership Act , 2008 ( including with respect appointment of designated partners , annual filings etc. ) . Also , in case of foreign investment , relevant filings/reportings would need to be made to the Reserve Bank of India etc .
Keeping the above in mind , entrepreneurs must explore the website https : //www.startupindia.gov.in/ , set up by the Indian Government to boost startups in India .

The decision by a politically powerful labor group to openly campaign against an embattled Los Angeles-area lawmaker drew a sharp rebuke on Friday from Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon .
The Lakewood Democrat lashed out hours after the State Building and Construction Trades Council of California filed paperwork for a political action committee to defeat Assemblywoman Cristina Garcia ( D-Bell Gardens ) . Garcia , who 's seeking her fourth term , took an unpaid leave of absence in February following allegations of sexual misconduct . She has denied the reports and an Assembly investigation remains underway .
Rendon did n't criticize the labor group by name , insisting instead that the decision was driven by oil and gas industry interests .
`` This is a thinly veiled attempt by Big Oil and polluters to intimidate me and my members . It is an affront to my speakership , ” Rendon said in a statement . “ We are proud of the work that the Assembly has done to increase jobs and wages while defending our environment . We will vigorously defend the members of our caucus from any ill-advised political attack . ''
A statement from the labor group , which sparred with Garcia last year on her effort to link new climate change policies with a crackdown on air pollution , said it had decided to “ reverse ” past support for her .
“ The Trades have thousands of hardworking members in Garcia 's district , and we look forward to lifting up another Democrat in the 58th Assembly to better represent them and their families , ” said the statement .
The political action committee 's campaign finance filing on Friday listed nonmonetary “ in kind ” contributions from Erin Lehane , a public affairs consultant aligned with the building labor group . Lehane said she had begun “ researching ” Garcia in November . In January , a former legislative staffer accused her of groping him in 2014 .
Lehane , who identified herself as a spokesperson for the labor group 's political action committee , said on Friday that she believed Garcia 's “ hypocrisy threatened a movement that will dictate how much harassment and abuse my daughter will face in her work life . ”
Garcia , who has been an outspoken advocate for women in the # MeToo movement , has complained that her political opponents helped fan the flames of the accusations . Through a campaign consultant , she declined to comment on Friday .
Rendon 's critique came on the heels of a full-page ad in The Times on Friday , partly paid for by the Trades Council , that criticized “ well-funded ivory tower elites ” who push proposals that hurt the oil and gas industry .
“ We are the real jobs that fuel the real California economy , ” read the advertisement .
Ever since her son was 6 months old , Juliet Hidalgo has been bringing him to the Marlton School , a low-slung building in Baldwin Hills that for generations has been a second home for deaf and hard-of-hearing students in Los Angeles .
Marlton staff taught Hidalgo 's brother and sister , both of whom are deaf . The school was where her deaf son learned to make the signs for “ milk ” and “ food. ” Hidalgo had planned to enroll her daughter , taking advantage of a popular program that allows hearing children to learn American Sign Language alongside their deaf siblings .
But after more than a decade of involvement , she and other family members are considering withdrawing their children . They are not alone .

2017 MARE NOSTRUM TOUR – BARCELONA
Just a day after her 17th birthday , Canada 's Penny Oleksiak added to her medal haul at the second of three Mare Nostrums stops with a silver medal and new Canadian Record in the women 's 50 fly .
She started the Barcelona stop off with a bronze medal in the 100 fly on her birthday , and followed up tonight with the 50 fly silver . Her swim of 25.76 lowers Katerine Savard ‘ s previous record of 25.92 , which she did twice last summer in June and July . When Savard first went 25.92 on June 25th , she lowered Oleksiak 's old record of 25.93 , set at the Canet-en-Roussillon stop of the tour last year on June 9th .
Sweden 's Sarah Sjostrom won gold in the event , a full second ahead of Oleksiak in 24.76 . Oleksiak out-touched Belgian Kimberly Buys ( 25.86 ) for the silver , with fellow Canadians Rebecca Smith ( 26.35 ) and Savard ( 26.69 ) also in the field , placing 5th and 7th overall respectively .
Along with the 50 and 100 fly , Oleksiak also swam the 100 free prelims in Barcelona , clocking 54.82 before scratching the final . She was also entered in the 200 free and 200 fly but opted not to swim .
Oleksiak moves into 3rd in the world in the event , trailing only Sjostrom and Japan 's Rikako Ikee .
The final stop of the tour is set to take place in Canet-en-Rousillon Saturday and Sunday .

Hot enough for you ?
The USA is sweltering through what will likely be its hottest May on record , according to a preliminary analysis of weather data .
National Weather Service meteorologist Victor Murphy said May 2018 should break the record set in May 1934 during the Dust Bowl .
The heat has been particularly noteworthy in the central U.S. , including the upper Midwest and northern Plains , where temperatures have run some 5-8 degrees above average , according to weather.us meteorologist Ryan Maue .
On Monday , the temperature in Minneapolis soared to a record 100 degrees , the city 's earliest 100-degree reading on record , buckling roads , straining air conditioners and triggering air quality alerts .
Other cities seeing record-breaking heat over the past few days include Chicago , Milwaukee , Green Bay and Des Moines , Radiant Solutions reported .
Overall , in just the past few days more than 1,900 heat records have been broken or tied , weather.com said .
According to PRISM , the avg . monthly temp for the CONUS for May is 64.6F , thru 5/28 . # NCEI shows the all-time CONUS record being 64.71F in May 1934 . With blast furnace temps across much of CONUS next 2 days , the Dust Bowl era record should fall . pic.twitter.com/O1OmDd2VsZ — victor murphy ( @ wxmanvic ) May 29 , 2018
For folks in the Midwest , the crazy heat of May follows what had been an unusually cold April . In fact , for two states in the Upper Midwest — Iowa and Wisconsin — it was the coldest April since records began in 1895 , the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said .
The Twin Cities saw their fourth-coldest April on record . Meteorologist Peter Mullinax of Planalytics said that Minneapolis ' weather whiplash from April to May was the biggest on record , a rebound of almost 30 degrees .
Nationally , April 2018 was the USA 's coldest April in 21 years .
Record-breaking snow also accompanied the cold in many areas , wreaking havoc with baseball schedules and seriously delaying the onset of spring .
During April , the average U.S. temperature was 48.9 degrees , which was 2.2 degrees below average , `` making it the 13th-coldest April on record and the coldest since 1997 , '' NOAA said .
Final weather data for May will be out in early June .
Entire Lower 48 USA has above average temperature for May 2018 except for rainy Florida and oddly enough California .

Illinois Secretary of State Jesse White 's legislation requiring judges to explain the rationale for rescinding statutory summary suspensions is moving on to the Senate after passing the House today .
House Bill 5042 , designed to strengthen the state 's drunk driving law , will prevent a statutory summary suspensions or revocation from being rescinded without a factual basis for the rescission from the court . White commended the Illinois House for approving HB 5042 , sponsored by state Rep. John D'Amico ( D-Chicago ) .
An SSS is an automatic suspension of driving privileges imposed by the Secretary of State 's office 46 days following a person 's arrest for DUI and/or refusal of chemical testing or submission to a chemical test that disclosed a breath/blood alcohol concentration of .08 or more , cannabis or controlled substances . An SSS is separate from subsequent criminal charges for a drunk driving offense .
Under the current SSS law , a judge may issue a rescission without providing an explanation . White 's office is then required to remove the SSS from the driving record . The legislation , which was recommended by White 's Traffic Safety Advisory Committee , will allow the secretary of state to return the rescission order to the judiciary and the SSS shall remain on the motorist 's record until White 's office receives a factual basis for rescission from the court .
“ Combating the dangers of drunk driving remains one of my top priorities as Secretary of State , ” White said . “ My goal is to make our roads as safe as possible and drunk driving jeopardizes the safety of everyone on the road , including the impaired driver . This legislation provides an additional measure to keep unsafe drivers from getting behind the wheel , requiring the courts to explain the rationale for rescinding a statutory summary suspension . ”
The Traffic Safety Advisory Committee consists of 12 members , including White as chairman ; state representatives John D'Amico ( D-Chicago ) , Mike McAuliffe ( R-Chicago ) , Marcus Evans ( D-Chicago ) and Michael Unes ( R-Pekin ) ; state senators Martin Sandoval ( D-Cicero ) and Michael Connelly ( R-Naperville ) ; David Bradford , Northwestern University Center for Public Safety ; Lt. Col. Chris Trame , Illinois State Police ; Shannon Alderman , Illinois Department of Transportation ; Jenny Burke , National Safety Council ; and Lyn Warren , National Highway Traffic Safety Administration .

Celebrated annually on the first Friday in June , the day of the pastry was established in 1938 to honor The Salvation Army Donut Lassies , women who served the treats to soldiers during World War I .
`` The doughnut was and continues to be a symbol of the comfort and support that The Salvation Army provides to more than 23 million people in need each year , '' said Lt. Col. Ward Matthews , Salvation Army secretary for national community relations and development in a statement .

Expect doughnut shops and bakeries to be crowded Friday even if they 're not giving away free treats .
Brad Plothow , vice president of brand and communications for Womply , a small business software provider , said the made-up holiday is a big day for bakeries .

Cricket - Sri Lanka v India - Third Test Match - Pallekele , Sri Lanka - August 13 , 2017 - India 's Umesh Yadav celebrates with captain Virat Kohli after taking the wicket of Sri Lanka 's Upul Tharanga ( not pictured ) .
PALLEKELE , Sri Lanka ( Reuters ) - India 's bowlers left Sri Lanka staring at a big defeat and a series whitewash after another shambolic batting performance saw the hosts being bundled out for 135 in their first innings in the third and final test on Sunday .
The hosts , who also suffered heavy defeats in Galle and Colombo inside four days , were made to follow on and reached 19 for one at close of the second day 's play , still trailing India by 333 with nine second innings wickets in hand .
Opening batsman Upul Tharanga made seven before he chopped Umesh Yadav onto his stumps for his second dismissal in the day . Dimuth Karunaratne was unbeaten on 12 with nightwatchman Malinda Pushpakumara yet to score .
It was all-rounder Hardik Pandya 's 108 , his maiden hundred , that set the ball rolling in the morning for the whitewash-chasing India , who posted 487 before being all out in the first over after the lunch break .
Pandya smashed his hundred off just 86 deliveries before he was the last batsman out , giving Sri Lanka left-arm spinner Lakshan Sandakan his maiden five-wicket haul in tests .
India fast bowler Mohammed Shami did the early damage to Sri Lanka 's first innings by dismissing both openers cheaply before left-arm wrist-spinner Kuldeep Yadav ran through the middle and lower order with four wickets for 40 .
Sri Lanka got off to a terrible start in their first innings when Tharanga edged Shami to wicketkeeper Wriddhiman Saha for five and inexplicably called for a review after consultation with opening partner Karunaratne .
Replays showed a clear edge and Karunaratne soon joined his departed colleague back in the dressing room after falling in similar fashion for four .
Kusal Mendis ( 18 ) was then run out after a mix-up with captain Dinesh Chandimal before former skipper Angelo Mathews fell leg before to medium-pace bowling all-rounder Pandya without scoring .

Chandimal was the only batsman to provide some resistance with a dogged 48 but became one of spinner Ravichandran Ashwin 's two wickets .
PANDYA HEROICS
Pandya 's century was also a maiden first-class ton for the 23-year-old right-hander , who hit eight boundaries and seven sixes in his knock .

India resumed on 329-6 but suffered an early blow when they lost Saha for 16 in the second over of the day after the keeper guided seamer Vishwa Fernando 's left-arm delivery straight into the hands of the gully fielder .
Kuldeep showed he was a more than capable lower-order batsman with a well-crafted 26 , more importantly adding 62 in an eighth-wicket stand that dampened Sri Lanka 's hopes of restricting the touring side to under 400 .
Kuldeep fell to his wrist-spinning counterpart Sandakan , who also dismissed Shami for eight .
That brought Pandya , unbeaten on one overnight , and Umesh together for the last wicket , allowing the former a license to free his bat in search of quick runs .
The clean-hitting Pandya soon tore into the Sri Lanka attack and blasted 26 in one over from Pushpakumara , hitting the left-arm spinner for two fours and three sixes in five deliveries .
He reached three figures with a straight punch for four off paceman Lahiru Kumara .
AUSTIN , Texas ( AP )  More than four-fifths of school districts offer no sex education or only teach abstinence in Texas , which has one of the country 's highest teen birth rates , according to a study released Tuesday .
The study commissioned by Texas Freedom Network , a left-leaning education watchdog group , found that 25 percent of roughly 1,000 school districts statewide did n't offer any sex education during the 2015-2016 school year and about 58 percent only taught students to abstain from sex .
The remaining 17 percent , including eight of the 10 largest school districts in America 's second most-populous state , stress abstinence , which they are required to do under a 1995 Texas law . But they also teach students about other sexual topics , including birth control .
The 17-percent figure is actually a marked increase from a 2009 study , which found that 96 percent of Texas school districts taught abstinence only .

The number of districts that offer no sex education rose even more dramatically , from 2 percent in the study eight years ago to a quarter of them today . A major factor in districts dropping their sex education curriculums was a 2009 decision by the Republican-controlled Texas Legislature to scrap passing a health course as a high school graduation requirement .
Of the districts that still teach sex education , 31 percent of the ones in urban areas offer instruction on more than just abstinence , while only about 5 percent of rural districts do .
The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services in 2014 ranked Texas tied with New Mexico for fourth nationwide in birth rates for mothers ages 15 to 19 . Some studies have found that comprehensive sex education that includes birth control information is more effective than abstinence-only programs at reducing teen pregnancy rates .
But 25 other states in addition to Texas require stressing abstinence , according to the Guttmacher Institute , a pro-abortion rights research organization . Eighteen states and the District of Columbia require students to be taught about contraception .
The authors of the new study sent surveys as open records requests to Texas ' 10 largest school districts and to a sample of 148 other districts seen as representative of the rest of the state . A breakdown by student population was n't provided , though the eight largest districts that teach more than just abstinence educate a combined 17 percent of the state 's roughly 5.3 million public students .
The study found that many districts not offering abstinence only lessons rely on two major sex education programs designed specifically for Texas that incorporate classroom games , discussions and role-playing to help students feel more empowered .
Republican Gov . Greg Abbott has been less vocal preaching abstinence than his predecessor , Rick Perry , who boasted that he knew from his personal life that it worked . Still , the Texas House approved a state budget prohibiting schools from distributing sex education materials produced by abortion providers like Planned Parenthood , which in the past helped devise such materials for some districts , including Austin 's .
Meanwhile , Texas ' state-approved health textbooks stress abstinence and have n't been updated since 2004 . Some abstinence-only classroom materials characterize using contraception as `` high risk '' sexual behavior , while at least one school cautioned students that sexual activity can lead to suicide .
State Rep. Mary Gonzalez , a Democrat from Clint , proposed legislation that would guarantee sex education programs provide accurate medical information . It has little chance of passing in the Legislature , but Gonzalez said she 'll appeal to her anti-abortion colleagues , arguing that better sex education could lead to fewer terminated pregnancies .
`` If you 're truly for limiting abortions , then here 's one way to do it , '' Gonzalez said .
Emirates Hills still rules as the place where investors should head to for the costliest properties in Dubai — there is currently one going for Dh129.9 million . The next two spots are taken by homes on the Palm with asking prices of Dh115 and Dh80 million , respectively , based on listings with Luxhabitat .
12 June , 2017 . With the Golden State Warriors up 129-120 in Game 5 of the NBA Finals , Kevin Durant , the newest Warrior , dribbled out the clock in front of his home fans . The league 's best team had defeated the league 's best player in a 4-1 series , capping off a trilogy of NBA Finals meetings between the Warriors and the Cavaliers . The 2017 victory gave Golden State a 2-1 lead in what had become a new rivalry for the ages .
Less than a day later , NBA experts were already wondering if these two top squads were destined for a rematch a year from then , an unprecedented fourth meeting at the summit .
Very quickly , however , fans saw that betting on a “ four-peat ” of Warriors-Cavaliers Finals was going to be a shot in the dark . Other teams around the league were n't happy to simply sit around and watch Stephen Curry , LeBron James and their teams dominate the NBA . They loaded up . Houston Rockets acquired Chris Paul . Oklahoma City Thunder added Paul George and Carmelo Anthony . The Celtics signed Gordan Hayward , and , in a trade that would shake up the Cavaliers , added Kyrie Irving .
While the Warriors mostly stood pat — reupping their core and adding a few minor pieces — the Cavaliers saw massive overhaul in the offseason . They lost their second-best player — the disgruntled Irving — and replaced him with a bunch of faces new and old , including a trio of guards with All Star credentials but concerns of injury and fitness : Isaiah Thomas , Dwyane Wade and Derrick Rose . Midseason , the sputtering Cavaliers made another major overhaul , this time replacing the trio of guards with a new collection of role players .
The Warriors looked good , but injuries to Curry and Durant , and a general air of the championship-hangover took away some of their aura of indestructability . Instead of Golden State , the best team in the league lay in Houston , where James Harden and Paul raced the squad to a 65-win season .
Out East , LeBron and the Cavs fell to fourth place , while Toronto Raptors , Boston Celtics , and Philadelphia 76ers all finished with a better record . The “ four-peat ” seemed to be in jeopardy . Were the Rockets better than the Warriors , some wondered ? Was one James ( Harden ) better than the other ( LeBron ) ?
After an entertaining six weeks of three playoff rounds , it seems that fate has favoured the continuing rivalry . The Warriors and the Cavaliers showcased brilliance in different ways in their playoff stretch . Here 's how both teams carved their way into the Finals once again :
Cleveland Cavaliers
Short answer : LeBron James
Full answer : LeBron James
LeBron 's postseason performance has been a unique phenomenon , simultaneously unbelievable and completely inevitable . Entering now his personal eighth consecutive Finals ( and ninth overall ) , LeBron has never had to carry more load single-handedly over his broad 33-year-old shoulders . Averaging 34 points , 9.2 rebounds , 8.8 assists , while shooting over 54 percent from the floor , this has been arguably the best post-season of LeBron 's career . He 's hit a couple of game-winners , made big plays on both ends of the court , and made superhuman stat-lines seem normal .
The Cavaliers as a whole have been largely inconsistent . In the First Round , the surprising , underrated Indiana Pacers pushed Cleveland to seven games , needing heroics from LeBron to pull off a victory in the final game of the series . Cleveland showed no hesitation against Toronto , the best team ( record-wise ) in the conference . For the third-consecutive season , LeBron brought an end to Toronto 's playoff run , this time in a heart-wrenching sweep .
The conference finals were the toughest challenge , even though the Cavs faced a young and inexperienced Celtics squad who were missing their two top scorers : Kyrie Irving and Gordon Hayward . For the first six games , each team protected their home court . In the high-stakes Game 7 , LeBron and Co held their cool while Boston 's erratic three-point shooting failed them at home . Cleveland , once again , booked their tickets to the Finals .
Golden State Warriors
Short answer : They have four All Stars , including two of the best four players in the NBA . Of course , they were going to make it to the Finals again .
Full answer : Injuries , cold stretches , and a lot of three-pointers , and if there is anything that the Warriors ' playoff run has proved , it 's that nothing is guaranteed , and even the best teams need heroic performances and luck on their side .
Last year , the Warriors swept the entire Western Conference and only lost one game in their championship run . This year was bound to be different . With Curry injured in the First Round and still hobbling in the second , the Warriors were convincing ( if not ruthless ) against the disciplined Spurs ( 4-1 ) and the Anthony Davis-led Pelicans ( 4-1 ) . Curry showed flashes of brilliance by the time he returned for the Pelicans series . Durant was elite on offence , Draymond Green on defence , and the Warriors — operating at less than 100 percent — were still good enough to make the Conference Finals .
But it was here that they faced the Rockets , perhaps the toughest team they 've had to play in the playoffs in the Durant-era . Houston , led by two future Hall-of-Fame guards in James Harden and Chris Paul and a plethora of accurate three-point shooters , were ready to strike down the champions . A back-and-forth series saw Warriors take a 2-1 lead , and then drop two close games to fall down 3-2 when a crucial member of their roster — Andre Iguodala — fell injured .
In Game 5 , the Rockets suffered their own , more serious injury : Chris Paul . Without CP3 , Houston resorted to taking more threes than ever , a strategy that helped them take double-digit leads in each of the last two games , before losing both in similar fashion to third quarter comebacks by Golden State . Curry , Klay Thompson , and Durant all found their groove back and the Warriors won Game 7 on the road to set up an anticipated Finals ' rematch with Cleveland .
The Finals
After all these years , LeBron and Curry must be sick of seeing each other in the Finals over and over again . But this year , there are added wrinkles to the equation . Durant , a relative newcomer to the rivalry , will return to challenge LeBron 's place at the top of NBA hierarchy . Meanwhile , the Warriors will be less familiar with this Cleveland squad which has changed its face so drastically over the past twelve months .
The Warriors won both regular season matchups against Cavs , 99-92 ( on Christmas ) and 118-108 ( in January ) . But on Game 1 on Thursday night ( Friday morning in India ) , they will be facing a team that has changed its identity . At the centre of it all , however , is the constant presence of LeBron . The key to stopping Cleveland will be in containing LeBron . This is n't an easy task , and every team — except the Warriors — has failed to do so in the past four years .
But if LeBron is an all-time great player , then the Warriors are an all-time great team . They have too many weapons , too much shooting , a better offence , and a better defence . Durant has the ability to match LeBron 's efforts ( like he did last year ) and there will be no answer in Cleveland for Curry , Thompson , and Green . The only thing that can beat the Warriors this year is their own carelessness ( turnovers , lazy offensive sets ) or injury misfortune . LeBron and an off-night by the Warriors might help Cleveland to one win in this series ; but expect the 2018 NBA season to finish just as the 2017 did : with Golden State atop the basketball world .
Prediction : Warriors win 4-1
Finals MVP : Stephen Curry

Well the term “ Never Give Up ” is a kind of very important thing which needs to be indulged in the minds of all the people specially the youth of the day as they are going to lead this country tomorrow . These morals are something which needs to be taught at the very low age in all the children but due to a flop education system which is producing clerks and crammers only we are unable to put this important thing in the minds of our young nation . Falling down is not something new or unnatural but how you get up after falling down is something which matters . We are living in a society which becomes happy when we fall down instead of encouraging us when we fall down . This is the main reason of so many unsuccessful people today in the world specially in my country and in my talented nation . Here if a man fails in something then instead of encouragement he faces brutal and hard words of others taunting him directly or indirectly . Even if a young man is willing to rise again after falling down he is given bad advices and told that he can not do this thing at all as he failed previously . Similarly so many people leave their education at the matric or inter-level because in case they got supplies in a subject or two then they are morally put down by the society and discouraged by all that they can not pass their exams even their family is not supportive to them in this type of things and finally they have to leave their field and result becomes useless for the society and we can call them burden on the society . Who are the people to decide about the future of a young man ? Should their role be negative ? If they can not encourage someone why discourage them ? Should we only blame the society for this all ?
Well the answer of the last question is a clear NO . We need to grow our self morally strong enough to tackle every type of situation in our life . Say no to all the negativity and keep moving forward no matter what price we have to pay for it . No need to indulge with people who are giving us wrong advices or bringing us morally down . The best way to respond these all critics is that give them the results by your actions . You do n't necessarily have to respond them and tell them that you can do that your works should be visible and your output should shock them and tell them what they think we can not do we did it .
We have the examples of so many leaders in our own history who remained committed to their work and the whole world was against them but in the end success was their destination . Our beloved prophet was treated badly by all the people but he was never discouraged and in the end we saw that Islam was in the very corner of the world . The second most important example is from our own history our beloved Quid Muhammad Ali Jinnah who remained committed to his task and today we are living in a country of our own .
These two examples are enough to prove my point and the youth should follow these leaders instead of the cowards in the society who never did something and are discouraging others as well . They are going to lead us tomorrow and they need to keep this thing in their mind that nothing is impossible .

A look at must-hear , recently released music , as chosen by The Times ' pop staff .
SZA , “ Ctrl ” ( Top Dawg Entertainment / RCA )
Falling into music after walking away from studying marine biology , SZA — born Solȧna Rowe — released a pair of mix-tapes before she became the lone female voice of L.A. hip-hop powerhouse Top Dawg Entertainment and delivered her breakout 2014 EP , “ Z . ”
“ Ctrl , ” like her earlier work , sees SZA navigating the complexities of love , sexual freedom , family , personal growth and self-esteem through the gaze of a woman who grew up in an Orthodox Muslim home . The records are tender , vulnerable and often defiant .
Self-doubt and uncertainty are explored with as much depth as lust and loneliness . “ Do you even know I 'm alive , ” she pines on “ Anything. ” She sings of her desire to be a “ Normal Girl , ” ruminates on aging on “ Prom ” and navigates a shared lover on the standout jam “ The Weekend. ” The music is equal parts aching , brazen and gorgeously honest . — Gerrick D. Kennedy
Bleachers , “ Gone Now ” ( RCA )
Five years ago , Jack Antonoff reached an audience of millions thanks to “ We Are Young , ” the Grammy-winning No . 1 single by his band Fun . And this week he 's likely to do it again with Friday 's release of “ Melodrama , ” the highly anticipated Lorde album that he co-produced with that young New Zealand pop star .
Antonoff , who 's also worked in the studio with Taylor Swift and Carly Rae Jepsen , wo n't reach anywhere near the same number of people with his second semi-solo album under the name Bleachers . But on “ Gone Now , ” which came out early this month , he sounds only dimly aware of that fact : These are grand-scaled electro-rock anthems that recall the fist-pumping likes of Arcade Fire and Bruce Springsteen even as they confess to an introvert 's anxieties . — Mikael Wood
The Secret Sisters , `` You Do n't Own Me Anymore , '' ( New West )
The third album from Muscle Shoals , Ala.-reared sisters Laura and Lydia Rogers shows no hint of anyone going Hollywood . Here , they 've turned to Brandi Carlisle to co-produce with brothers Tim and Phil Hanseroth after being guided on their previous two efforts by their mentor , T Bone Burnett .
If anything , they 've stripped things down further with hauntingly spare arrangements of songs that revel in Southern Gothic themes , which soar through their exquisite sibling harmonies . The Rogers sisters ' originals often dive deep into consuming all-or-nothing matters of the heart and the myriad emotions associated with home and all it conveys . They apply their ethereal voices to Paul Simon 's “ Kathy 's Song , ” his gorgeous early ode to a faraway love . The purity of intention and execution is palpable . — Randy Lewis
Joan Shelley , “ Joan Shelley ” ( No Quarter )
Amid today 's onslaught of breaking news notifications , it 's comforting to know that this Louisville singer and songwriter 's brand of pastoral beauty is out there . Shelley 's new album continues her focus on earthen themes that are as relevant today as they were centuries ago when another Shelley , poet Percy Bysshe , was romanticizing them : love and desire , dawning and fading light , natural beauty and the delicacy of emotion .
Produced by Jeff Tweedy of the rock band Wilco , Shelley 's 11 songs highlight her precise vocal and guitar melodies and express a desire , as she writes in “ If the Storms Never Came , ” to “ plant in rows the fruit you want/ Train hands to push the clay/ And pull in close , you feed the ones/ You do n't want far away . ”
Behind her , Tweedy offers meditative bass lines , his drummer-son Spencer taps out understated rhythms , guitarist Nathan Salsburg adds labyrinthine lines and multi-instrumentalist James Elkington switches between piano and resonator guitar .
Like her excellent previous album , “ Over and Even ” ( 2015 ) , Shelley 's new one is a subtle venture that requires focused listening — put down your phone — to fully appreciate . In such a habitat , the songs blossom with a lushness akin to the themes that occupy her lyrical world — “ widening skies , ” “ your head across my thigh ” and “ your creases and your lines. ” — Randall Roberts
JACKSON CENTER — In accordance with their ongoing commitment to promote safety in the workplace , as well as in the local community , Airstream , Inc. , in Jackson Center , hosted a tactical training drill for several local law enforcement agencies .
Airstream agreed to allow specialized law enforcement officers to use its main manufacturing facility as the stage for several simulated emergency situations where critical response was called for .
Airstream Marketing Specialists Tyler Williams , Adam Grilliot , and Jay Cullis were on hand to welcome those in attendance and answer any general questions pertaining to Airstream 's involvement and what was hoped to be gained by the drill .
“ The number one priority at Airstream is the safety of our employees , ” said Williams . “ In partnering with local law enforcement and rescue agencies , we hope to develop a good working relationship and encourage preparedness in case there is ever a need for assistance . We would like to thank all those involved , including a number of our employees who are participating in various capacities . ”
Jackson Center Police Chief Chuck Wirick also voiced his appreciation for all who planned , contributed to , and executed the training session , but most especially Airstream for hosting the event .
“ Airstream graciously agreed to allow us to come here and use their building during their annual planned manufacturing shutdown , which provided the perfect setting for this kind of exercise , ” Wirick said . “ We are constantly training for this , and other emergency situations , but unless given the chance to try out our techniques and equipment , we 're not fully trained ; this drill allowed us to do just that .
“ Very seldom do we get a chance to integrate K9 units into a practice drill , so this was a unique opportunity in that respect . We set up and responded to several critical response scenarios , including interaction with an active shooter , dealing with an unknown number of armed suspects , providing assistance to critically injured victims and defusing potential threats , like a hostage situation .
“ Our goal is to make sure law officials and everyone involved in responding is on the same page ; organization is key and there is no substitute for planning ahead and proper training . ”
There were a number of local law enforcement agencies on hand , as well as a few Wildlife Officers with the Ohio Department of Natural Recourses . Co-organizer Wirick estimated there were at least 120 people in attendance .
There were five S.W.A.T . teams with 12 people on each team , along with law officers representing the following agencies :

The soaring temperatures and high humidity added an additional level of challenges associated with the exercise , but Chief Wirick said , “ That 's all just part of it ; it 's not the best day to be out in the sun dressed in black clothing and the temperature inside the building was well over 100° in some places , but there is no guarantee on what type of environment we 'll be facing , so in a way , the heat made the drill more realistic . ”
Besides the obvious concerns and tasks associated with overcoming the source of the problem in a critical response call , there is also the issue of treating seriously wounded victims and bystanders . During the practice drill , Anna Rescue and the Airstream Critical Response team was on hand and set up a mobile triage center where volunteers posing as injured victims were assembled and examined to determine the type of treatment needed based on the degree of injury ; some were superficial , others critical .
Each “ victim ” was assigned a particular injury and the rescue team then worked to determine the severity of the injury while delivering essential treatment in preparation to move the victim to the nearest hospital . This process rations patient treatment efficiently when resources are insufficient for all to be treated immediately .
Conducting the triage determines the order and priority of emergency treatment , transport , and final destination for each patient .
Jessica Lemly , with Anna Rescue , noted how important it is to be properly trained for this part of a critical response situation .
“ Unlike other emergency responses , rescuers responding to this kind of setting are often overwhelmed with the number of casualties and degree of injury , ” Lemly said . “ There is no time to think , just act . Our job is to make a quick assessment , record our findings , and relay the information to the hospital so they know what 's coming and what to expect when the patient arrives . ”
Another key element of the response was two mobile command and communication vehicles . The Buckeye Sheriff 's Association and Darke County Sheriff 's Department was on hand with their mobile command units ; trailers with climate control and a variety of radios , computers , scanners , and other equipment designed to coordinate resources in the event of a response .
Video transmitted from drones flying above the scene was analyzed and used in the response as well .
During the drills , three attendees representing the media were allowed to witness and document the procedures used to locate and subdue suspects in two situations ; one using the K9 unit and the other employing one of the S.W.A.T . teams .
“ Colt , ” a sturdy black police dog , was brought to a field where a suspect was hiding behind a large electrical utility box . The dog was notably excited and ready to do its job ; it located the scent of the suspect in the grass and tracked it to the hiding place where the criminal was discovered and overpowered .
Colt made quick work of the situation and had the assailant neutralized in no time ; it was noted that dogs can be very effective in locating and defusing certain threats that would be impossible any other way .
After coordinating and carrying out a number of exercises , the law enforcement officers and rescue personnel were moved to an air-conditioned area where lunch was provided by The Heidout Restaurant and Bar , in Jackson Center ; doughnuts were provided by Casey 's General Store in the morning before the drill , and Plastipak Packaging provide the much-appreciated iced bottled water .

Throughout his eight years in office , Barack Obama made a number of important decisions that that flew in the face of conventional American wisdom , including his handling of Bradley Manning , now known as Chelsea Elizabeth Manning post sex change , who was convicted on various violations of the Espionage Act , and his handling of Edward Snowden , who famously leaked classified documents on the NSA 's data collection practices .
There was also Bowe Bergdahl , a known Army deserter who Obama traded the equivalent of the Taliban “ Dream Team ” in exchange for Bergdahl 's release , while he left other captured Americans to rot in places like Iran . Finally , who can forget Obama 's policy of open borders , despite the ongoing threat from ISIS and radical Islamic terror ? It 's hard to argue that many of Obama 's controversial decisions left Americans less vulnerable than they otherwise would have been , so why would Americans expect anything different when it comes to the pardons Obama chose to grant before he departed office ?
In the end , Obama wound up commuting the sentences of 1,715 prisoners , the largest number of commutations by any President in U.S. history , according to the New York Post article below .
In the following video , Right Wing News highlights how one of the repeat offenders Obama let go , is now facing life in prison ( again ) , after buying 2 pounds of cocaine , and then engaging in a high-speed chase with before finally being re-arrested . Time will tell how many of the other 1,715 that Obama set free will also offend again…
The New York Post reports :
A Texas man whose life sentence on drug charges was commuted by former President Obama is back behind bars after cops caught him with more than two pounds of cocaine following a high-speed chase , according to a report .
Robert M. Gill , 68 , had been imprisoned in 1990 for for cocaine and heroin distribution before Obama set him free along with other non-violent federal inmates in 2015 , the San Antonio Express News reported .
During his eight years in office , Obama commuted 1,715 prison sentences , more than any other president .
Last Thursday , according to federal court papers , Gill met with his probation officers and then went to the parking lot of a food market to buy more than 2 pounds of cocaine .
Gill met a person who gave him a black backpack that he placed in his vehicle , and a sheriff 's deputy in an unmarked car tried to stop him , the affidavit said .
But Gill took off and after a high-speed chase collided with another vehicle where deputies were able to disable his car .
Officers found the cocaine in the backpack and put him under arrest , the affidavit said .
Gill “ related that he was going to sell the cocaine to make money and would be paying a female $ 26,000 for the cocaine , ” the affidavit said .
“ I 'm so disappointed to hear that he got arrested again , ” Ronald Schmidt , a lawyer who helped Gill appeal his life sentence in the courts , told the San Antonio newspaper .
In signing his release , Obama said he did so “ because you have demonstrated the potential to turn your life around . … Now it is up to you to make the most of this opportunity . ”
Gill 's prison warden also stood up for him , saying : “ Robert has reformed and rehabilitated himself and poses no threat to the outside world . ”
Gill has been charged with possession with intent to distribute 500 grams or more of cocaine and was held without bail .
He faces a return to prison for up to 40 years , if convicted .

The marketplace comes as a number of companies experiment with the concept , most notably adding some element of streetwear in the mix stemming from the successes of ComplexCon in Long Beach . Adidas earlier this year made a go at a similar event , taking over the former American Apparel factory in downtown for its 747 Warehouse event during the All-Star Game weekend and then continued on with a smaller-scale exhibition called 3 Rooms done in partnership with skateboarder and entrepreneur Na-Kel Smith . Refinery 29 's 29 Rooms , while not focused on the streetwear market , made its way to the West Coast for the first time earlier this year and was another mix of art installations melding fashion , technology and culture .

A group of central Iowans who are skilled with chainsaws formed an emergency response team after volunteering together clearing debris in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina in 2005 .
Kim Dreher , co-director of the West Des Moines-based Valley Disaster Relief , says they now focus on responding to local and national disasters as well as removing trees for low-income Iowans .
“ We run into a lot of people with health issues or loss of jobs , ” Dreher says . “ We probably deal with 50 to 60 % are single women , either older or raising a family by themselves , obviously , they do n't have the income to take care of a $ 2,500 tree job , as an example . ”
The all-volunteer unit has about 40 members , all from central Iowa , and they 've put in more than two-thousand work hours this past year on some 200 jobs across the region . Some projects involve simply clearing trees so Habitat for Humanity can build a new house .
They 've had a great amount of the chainsaws and safety gear donated and also have a “ bucket truck ” as well as a bus that can hold 11 people and all of their equipment for going on the road .
“ If we go to a disaster site , we work with the local governing authorities at that site , ” Dreher says . “ A lot of times , we 'll hook up with other disaster organizations or we 'll work with a church in the location where the disaster is and they 'll have a list of the people who need help . ”
Dreher is a real estate agent when he 's not coordinating jobs for the organization . Whether it 's a tornado , ice storm , hurricane or just an old tree that 's fallen , Dreher says the team is devoted to spreading the word of God through service to those in need .
“ We try to have a conversation with the homeowner because it 's really not about cutting up trees , it 's really about stepping out and helping people that have other issues , ” Dreher says . “ If there 's an opportunity for us to refer somebody to an organization that can help them further , we do that . ”
He says listening to people 's stories , hearing about their hardships and praying with them , is often as helpful to them as the physical labor .
There has been another death in Illinois involving synthetic marijuana use . More than 150 people in Illinois in 13 counties have been sickened by synthetic cannabinoids laced with rat poison .
Two of the deaths occurred in men who were in their 20s ; the third was a man in his 40s . The most recent death was a woman in her 30s in central Illinois .
Individuals who have been sickened by the synthetic cannabinoids have reported coughing up blood , blood in the urine , severe bloody nose , bleeding gums , and/or internal bleeding . A chemical found in rat poison , brodifacoum , prevents blood from clotting , resulting in severe bleeding .
“ We continue to see new cases of individuals experiencing severe bleeding after using synthetic cannabinoids , ” said IDPH Director Nirav D. Shah , M.D. , J.D . “ Like so many other drugs , synthetic cannabinoids are addictive and people are not able to give them up . Alternatively , they think that it wo n't happen to them because they know their dealer or trust wherever they purchased the drugs . If you know someone who uses synthetic cannabinoids , tell them these are deadly products and try to help them get treatment . ”
The drugs can be found at convenience stores , gas stations , drug paraphernalia shops , novelty stores , and online . But since synthetic marijuana is not regulated and people do n't know what chemicals may be in them , officials urge people not to use them , ever .

Fort Myers couple paid $ 2,000 to contractor who never showed up
One North Fort Myers couple says they paid a contractor over $ 2,000 to fix damage caused by Hurricane Irma .
But they say he never showed up .
“ Hurricane Irma took part of the roof off—that 's where we have the office and our car port , ” said Fort Myers resident Alice Austin .
Tom and Alice Austin moved quick to fix their home after Irma damaged it . They hired Stephen Parella . He does n't have a license , but he came highly recommended .
“ We contacted and hired him , and gave him a sizable down payment . We have n't heard back from him and there does n't seem to be a way to contact him , ” Austin said .
The couple has a receipt from Parella for the roof and car port repairs . The total to fix it all came to over $ 4,600 . The Austin 's paid him half .
The Austin 's say three other neighbors gave Parella some money , but got no work done . But they 're the ones that gave him over $ 2,000 .
“ We do n't want anyone else to have the same type of problem with him . If he wants to come back and finish the work or give us the money back—that would be wonderful , ” Austin said .
The couple is now taking bids for the roof and car port . They say they 'll be looking for a licensed contractor .

Florida may be a hurricane prone state but that does n't stop people moving here . The influx of new residents puts pressure on the sunshine state 's natural environment .
Bob McClure from the James Madison Institute , a free market think-tank , joins Intersection for a conversation about the environment and property rights .
“ You have this potential collision course where you have massive growth in the state of Florida running up against this beautiful , very very dynamic and diverse environment here like the springs , and the everglades jewel , ” he said .
“ I think the discussion of what happens with that kind of pressure is an important one to have . ”
McClure said although a 2014 amendment was enacted to help buy new wildlife preserves , he questions whether the state can manage the land it already owns .
“ Florida already has 30 percent of the state in government hands , but nobody was managing it , ” he said .
“ What the legislature chose to do with that amendment was that they took a significant amount of that money and put it into managing that land . ”

TWO wins against the same opponent in as many nights has helped fuel Sheffield Steelers ' belief that they can go on and win a third successive Elite League title .
The defending champions , who have won five EIHL titles in all since the league began back in 2003 , certainly helped their cause when following up Saturday 's nervy 2-1 victory over Manchester Storm with a slightly more comprehensive performance across the Pennines last night , which saw them prevail 4-1 .
At exactly the halfway point of the regular season , it leaves the Steelers 10 points adrift of leaders Cardiff Devils with three games in hand .
Crucially , the two rivals – who have taken their title fight to the last weekend of the season for the last two years , with the Steelers prevailing on both occasions – still have to play each other three times .
If there is one thing that the Steelers need to improve on in 2017 it will be their form against Andrew Lord 's side , who have won all five previous league meetings this season .
The positive mood enjoyed by the Steelers this morning will contrast sharply with how they will have felt last Wednesday when coming to terms with two straight defeats at the hands of arch-rivals Nottingham Panthers .
But defenceman Ben O'Connor insisted that the South Yorkshire club had got over their disappointment in time to get the better of an in-form Manchester side , who had risen to fifth in the table last week .
“ We 're feeling good , the mood in the camp is good , ” said O'Connor .
“ I think we 've still got a very good chance of winning the title . If you look at the past years , it is the back end of the season where we 've excelled and I do n't see why that should be any different this year .
“ We 've had a bit of a blip in recent weeks , but everyone does at some stage of the season .

“ This is where we kick on , learn from our mistakes and go forward . ”
At Altrincham Ice Arena last night , the Steelers got on the scoresheet after 13 minutes when Mike Ratchuk found the net from a feed off Markus Nilsson on the powerplay .
The visitors then doubled their advantage before the end of the period through another powerplay strike , John Armstrong firing home with just 21 seconds left on the clock .
Manchester 's Mark Heatley received a 2+10 penalty for checking from behind , while Connor Varley was ejected from the game for high sticks as the contest intensified in what proved to be a goalless second period .
If you look at the past years , it is the back end of the season where we 've excelled and I do n't see why that should be any different this year Ben O'Connor , Sheffield Steelers .
But the Steelers extended their advantage again with a third goal at 52.02 when Ratchuk doubled his tally for the night .
Darian Dzuirzynski pulled one back just under five minutes later to give the home fans faint hopes of a comeback , but that was extinguished when Robert Dowd sealed both points by firing into the empty net with 11 seconds remaining .
On Saturday afternoon at Sheffield Arena , it was a far from pretty performance from the Steelers , who were desperate to bounce back after their dual disappointment against the Panthers earlier in the week .
It required a late powerplay goal from Levi Nelson to secure both points .
It was not until just under five minutes into the second period that the deadlock was actually broken , Guillaume Desbiens making a 5-on-3 powerplay count when he poked home following good work from Ben O'Connor and Mathieu Roy while the Storm 's Paul Swindlehurst and Dallas Ehrhardt were in the box .
That is how it remained until the third period when Manchester pulled level in controversial circumstances with just over 10 minutes left .

As Yared Hagos 's two-minute spell in the penalty box came to an end , Desbiens seemed to be impeded by Storm goaltender Mike Clemente as he attempted to track back following the breakdown of a Steelers ' attack .
Hagos came out of the box , but it was too late as , with Desbiens trailing the play , the extra man told for the visitors when Dziurzynski swept home from a feed from Varley .
But a hooking call on Heatley with just over two minutes remaining proved pivotal , Nelson forcing the puck home to the relief of an anxious New Year 's Eve crowd .
ISLAMABAD : Senate Select Committee , yesterday , unanimously adopted the Right to Information ( RTI ) Bill 2016 tabled by the government as it made mandatory upon the state institutions concerned to provide information about the missing persons within three days . The RTI bill is aimed at replacing the Freedom of Information Ordinance at the federal level . The proposed law recognises citizens ' right to know under the Constitution and to have access to information about the activities of the government .
Under the law , a three-member commission will be formed to hear the case of RTI request and it will take into account requests up to 20 years as the record older than 20 years will automatically pass into the public domain . The three-member commission with the power to order public bodies to disclose information and provide records hear the RTI requests . The commission will consist of three members : once each from the judiciary , bureaucracy and civil society .
During the preliminary meeting held here under Senator Farhatullah Babar of PPP , members of the committee reviewed the bill clause-by-clause and unanimously adopted all amendments and recommendations .
Senator FarhatUllah Babar was of the view that the draft law would greatly help citizens in securing the maximum information and would also go a long away in addressing the issue of missing persons .
He maintained that under the emphasis of the bill , there would be no exemption regarding human right issues or corruption in the guise of national security . Senator Babar remarked that in case a person was picked and killed by security agencies , the agencies would no longer be able to use ‘ national security ' as an excuse not to provide information on the matter . Penal action will be taken against members of the commission in case they deliberately destroy any records . A standing committee of the Senate and the National Assembly will have the authority to remove members of the commission .
He stressed that underlying purpose was that no information which is linked to matters of fundamental human rights would be allowed to be withheld . State Minister for Information and Broadcasting , Marriyam Aurangzeb , clarified that information regarding national security , foreign relations and national interests would not be made public under the new proposed law .
The Right to Information Bill would be proposed in parliament during the next session . The constituents of the proposed law recognises citizens ' ‘ right to know ' and right to information about the government 's activities : aims to facilitate those seeking information on government 's activities and ensuring transparency ; seeks to protect whistleblowers who want to expose corruption in public and security institutions , seeks to ensure that information on missing persons is provided within three days of request .
The priority and preference of the bill is to ensure that information on missing persons is provided in writing by the relevant institution within three days of a request for information . Furthermore , the bill also includes provisions for the protection of whistleblowers , as any person associated with a public entity who raises a yellow flag on corruption and misappropriations in that entity will be protected under the law , and will receive immunity from prosecution in related cases .

DAR ES SALAAM ( Reuters ) - Tanzanian President John Magufuli ordered the immediate release of a popular local musician on Monday , a day after he was arrested for allegedly mocking the government in a song .
Police had accused Ney wa Mitego of showing disrespect for the presidency in his newly-released Swahili rap song entitled Wapo . The lyrics of the song do not mention Magufuli by name but question the infringement of freedom of speech in Tanzania . It also criticises the leadership of the country .
Magufuli , nicknamed `` the bulldozer '' for his strict leadership style , has won some praise from Western donors for anti-corruption drives and cutting wasteful government spending since coming to power in November 2015 .
But opponents accuse him of becoming increasingly authoritarian , undermining democracy by curbing political activity and cracking down on dissent .
More than 10 people , including university students , have been charged in different court cases over the past few months for insulting the president via social networking platforms , such as WhatsApp .
Insulting the president was made a criminal offence in Tanzania under a cybercrimes law passed in 2015 , punishable by up to three years in jail , a fine of around $ 3,000 , or both .
The government described the arrest of the musician and the banning of his song by a state-run arts council as `` drastic measures '' .
Tanzania 's information minister , Harrison Mwakyembe , told journalists the president wanted wa Mitego to rework the song . `` It should be improved to also talk about other evils in society , such as tax evasion and drug trafficking , '' the minister quoted the president as saying to him .
CLAIM
A video shows a man demonstrating an invisibility cloak .
FALSE
RATING
FALSE
ORIGIN
A video purportedly showing a man demonstrating the abilities of his new invisibility cloak went viral in December 2017 . Most English speaking internet users encountered this footage after it was shared on Facebook by “ Shotded , ” where it gained more than 22 million views within two days of its initial posting .
However , this video originally gained traction when it was posted to the Chinese social media site Weibo on 4 December 2017 by 陈士渠 ( Chen Shiqu ) , an internet user who claimed to be the Deputy Director of Criminal Investigation Bureau of the Ministry of Public Security :
[ Translation Via Google Translate ] Quantum cloak is made of quantum stealth material into clothing , by reflecting the light waves around the wearer , can make people wearing such clothes to achieve “ invisible ” effect . This technology can be more used in the military , so soldiers like to wear “ stealth military uniform ” , but also can avoid night vision goggles . My question is criminals used stealth clothes police supposed to ! ?
The convincing video and the seemingly authoritative source led many to believe that this was an authentic invisibility cloak .
Although Chen Shiqu does appear to truly be the Deputy Director of the Criminal Investigation Bureau in China , this video does not appear on the official government web site ( nor its Facebook page ) and our search for a “ quantum cloak ” and “ quantum steal material ” yielded no results on the CIB web site . In short , the Criminal Investigation Bureau in China did not officially endorse this footage .
Furthermore , Chen Shiqu did not create this footage . YouTube user 瞭望亞太 ( Looking Asia Pacific ) posted this video on 3 December 2017 , a day before the supposed Deputy Director of China 's Criminal Investigation Bureau 's post . And although they claimed that this material was “ Made in China , ” this YouTuber did n't provide any information about where or when this video was taken or who developed this groundbreaking material :
【国产量子隐身衣】量子隐身衣是通过量子隐形材料制作成衣服，透过反射穿衣者身边的光波，可以使得穿着这种衣服的人达到 “ 隐形 ” 的效果。此技术更可用于军事上，让士兵像穿上 “ 隐形军衣 ” ，还可以避过夜视镜。 【Made in China Quantum Invisibility Clinics】 Quantum stealth clothing is made of quantum invisible materials into clothes , through the reflection of the light waves around the wearer , can make people wearing such clothes to achieve “ invisible ” effect . This technology can be more used in the military , so soldiers like to wear “ stealth military uniform ” , but also can avoid night vision goggles .
Despite these audacious claims , the actual footage contains several clues that this invisibility cloak is nothing more than the result of video editing . At the 38-second mark , for instance , the presenter accidentally touches a plant with his leg . This creates two visuals that conflict with how we 'd expect a real invisibility cloak to work . First , we see the plant “ double ” as the real plant ( which was knocked by the man 's leg ) moves and the digital plant remains in place :
A few moments later this plant can be seen shaking . But as the invisibility cloak covers it up , it instantaneously becomes motionless again . The motion of the plant resumes once it is no longer hidden behind the invisibility cloak :
This indicates that this invisibility cloak is actually some sort of green screen . The filmmaker shot footage of the background and then projected that image onto the green sheet in order to make it appear as if the man disappeared behind an invisibility cloak . When the man touches the plant , however , the background footage and the invisibility footage no longer match up , which causes the odd visuals seen above .
Zhu Zhen Song , a producer for the Star Orange Quantum video production company , came to a similar conclusion . Song explained to the Shanghai Observer that this video was likely made with a blue or green cloth and a computer software program such as After Effect :
星橙量子视频制作公司的监制竺桢淞看完这段视频后向记者表示，这应该是用蓝色或绿色塑料布来拍摄，再通过后期抠像技术编辑而成的，有不少视频后期合成软件可以做出这样的效果，比如我们熟知的After Effect，以及Nuke和Fusion等软件。 竺桢淞解释了这段视频的大概制作原理。第一遍，先拍摄无人纯背景。第二遍，人物拿着蓝布再拍一遍。然后，用软件把蓝布部分抠除，把两次的视频合成，就出来了 “ 隐形衣 ” 这种效果。类似技术在电影上已经普遍使用，如各类科幻电影。 Star Orange Quantum video production company producer Zhu Zhen Song after watching this video to reporters that this should be shot with blue or green plastic cloth , and then edited by the late Keying technology , there are many video post-synthesis software You can make such an effect , such as the well-known After Effect , as well as Nuke and Fusion software . Zhu Zhen Song explained the principle of this video production . The first time , first shot unmanned pure background . The second time , the figure holding a blue cloth and then pat it again . Then , using software to pull part of the blue cloth , the two video synthesis , came out “ invisible clothing ” this effect . Similar technologies are commonly used in movies , such as various science fiction movies .
Another indication that this video was digitally edited can be spotted just after the 1 minute mark when the man 's fingers disappear despite being in front of the green screen :
Dozens of similar amateur videos can be found on YouTube . Although the following footage may not be as convincing as the viral invisibility cloak video , they both use similar editing techniques :

Lisa Dudley , and her partner , Guthrie McKay were shot in their Mission home in September 2008
Guthrie McKay and Lisa Dudley were shot in their Mission home in September 2008 .
After 10 years of waiting , Rosemarie Surakka 's request for a public inquest into the death of her daughter is going forward .
Surakka 's daughter , Lisa Dudley , and her partner , Guthrie McKay , were shot in their Mission home in September 2008 .
The BC Coroners Service announced Tuesday it has scheduled a public inquest into Dudley 's death for June 11 in Burnaby .
The inquest was announced initially in 2010 . According to a news release , the dates were confirmed only now , so as not to interfere with criminal proceedings , which concluded in 2017 .
In 2008 , McKay died at the scene , but Dudley , who was 37 at the time , stayed alive for four days before finally being discovered by a neighbour . She was airlifted to hospital , but died later that day .
Last February , a B.C . Supreme Court judge dismissed Surakka 's lawsuit claiming the RCMP failed to properly investigate the death of her daughter .
Four men were eventually convicted : Jack Woodruff , Justin MacKinnon , Bruce Main and Thomas Holden .
During the investigation and four separate trials , court heard that Cpl . Mike White , the RCMP officer responding to a shots-fired call at the couple 's home , left the scene after being there for approximately 10 minutes , without going inside , and did not follow up the next day .
Four years later , White was reprimanded and docked one day 's pay following a review by the adjudication board .
The coroner had also previously announced its intention to hold an inquest into the death of McKay .
While the circumstances of both deaths were explored through criminal proceedings , the release said , Dudley 's death raises issues that are not applicable to McKay 's death , so an inquest will not be held .
× Andrew McCabe turned over his memo on Comey 's firing to Robert Mueller
Former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe has turned over a memo he drafted related to the firing of his former boss , FBI Director James Comey , to the special counsel 's office , according to a source familiar with the matter .
The document , first reported by The New York Times , details McCabe 's impressions of a meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein where the subject of Comey 's firing came up after he had been dismissed , according to the source .
In the meeting , Rosenstein said President Donald Trump had initially asked him to reference the Russia investigation . Rosenstein ultimately authored a controversial memo outlining the ways Comey had flouted Justice Department protocols leading up to the 2016 election but did not mention the Russia probe .
The source confirmed to CNN that McCabe 's memo recounting this meeting with Rosenstein , as well as an early draft of Trump 's letter firing Comey , has been turned over to special counsel Robert Mueller . What exactly Trump 's draft letter says and when it was turned over remain unclear .
The President and his allies have pointed to Rosenstein 's memo in the past , questioning why he has not stepped aside from overseeing Mueller 's investigation given his role in the firing of Comey .
But CNN reported in April that Rosenstein has consulted with the career ethics adviser at the Justice Department about this issue and continues to oversee the probe .
The Justice Department declined to comment .
As CNN previously reported , McCabe has turned over his other contemporaneous notes to Mueller , which detail what Comey shared with McCabe about his private interactions with Trump while he was FBI director .

( Bloomberg ) —A staggering number of American homeowners remain underwater on their mortgages a decade after the housing bubble burst .
Almost 4.5 million households -- or 9.1 percent -- owed more than their homes are worth in the fourth quarter of 2017 , according to data firm Zillow , with an estimated 713,000 owing at least twice as much as their property 's value .
While the percentage is declining , families in communities with stagnant property values are “ trapped in their homes with no easy options to regain equity other than waiting , ” said Aaron Terrazas , a senior economist at Zillow .
That in turn could weigh on local economic growth .
Virginia Beach , Virginia ; Baltimore and Chicago are the hardest hit metropolitan areas , based on effective negative interest rates .
Effective negative equity measures the lack of sufficient home equity to pay for the associated costs of selling homes and buying new properties .

The number of alcohol breath tests deployed by police on England 's roads has fallen by a quarter in the last five years , a new report has said .
The figures , published by the Institute of Alcohol Studies on Friday , also show the number of Roads Policing Officers employed by English police forces fell by 27 per cent between 2011/12 and 2015/16 .
Catching drink drivers is a priority for police in Lancashire and we will continue to crack down on drink driving to help make our roads safer .
But today Lancashire police vowed there would be no let-up in their fight to catch drink drivers despite falling staffing levels ,
Roads Policing Officers are responsible for patrolling motorways and main roads .
Some forces have lost more than 83 per cent of these officers since 2011 , the report said .
If the use of alcohol breath tests – used by police to test whether a driver is drunk – had been maintained at its 2011 level , the report said , more than a quarter of a million ( 260,681 ) more breath tests would have been used .
The report pointed to a cut in police budgets to explain the decline .
On average , the budget for policing roads has fallen from £5.3m to £4.35m since 2011 for each of the 18 forces who supplied data , the report said .
The institute called for the introduction of random roadside breath-testing to tackle the problem .
It also asked the government to launch mass media campaigns to properly explain the dangers of drink-driving to the public .
It also repeated its call for the drink-drive limit to be lowered from its current level of 80mg of alcohol per 100ml of blood to 50mg/100ml .
That would put England and Wales in line with the rest of Europe , including Scotland and Northern Ireland .
Katherine Brown , chief executive of the Institute for Alcohol Studies , said : “ Where enforcement levels are on the wane , more public campaigns would raise awareness about the dangers of drink-driving , and a lower drink drive limit would provide a cost-effective way of limiting the risk of people getting behind the wheel after consuming alcohol . ”
Lancashire Constabulary has lost 800 officers owing to cuts since 2010 , according to the force .
The Institute of Alcohol Studies report says Lancashire now has 112 road officers , compared to 143 in 2011 .
A Lancashire Police spokesman said : “ Drinking when driving is unacceptable and our efforts to catch those responsible will continue .
“ Catching drink drivers is a priority for police in Lancashire and we will continue to crack down on drink driving to help make our roads safer . ”
The NFL power rankings Week 18 edition arrives as the NFL Playoff picture has been determined with a dozen teams looking towards the Super Bowl in Houston , Texas . The two favorites , the New England Patriots and Dallas Cowboys , closed out their seasons in different fashions , but each will remain top seed heading into their postseasons . In addition , the Redskins played themselves out of a playoff spot , while Green Bay and Detroit battled it out for the NFC North division title . So who finished the regular season atop the NFL power rankings for Week 18 ? On Sunday , NFL.com reported that New England captured home-field advantage throughout the AFC Playoffs thanks to their convincing win over Miami . Tom Brady and company won the game 35-14 in a game that was never out of their control . Brady also helped continue his quest for an MVP award win this season and completed the best touchdown to interception ratio in a season with his 28 touchdowns to two interceptions stat . The 39-year-old Patriots quarterback finished the day with 276 yards and three touchdowns on 25-for-33 passing . It also gave them a win over a 10-6 Miami team that is headed for the playoffs . All of that said , it will give New England the top spot in the power rankings to close the regular season out . They took over the spot from the Dallas Cowboys several weeks ago , but these two teams are the favorites to meet in the Super Bowl in a little over a month from now . Unfortunately for Dallas , they were on the losing end of their game on Sunday which saw the return of veteran Tony Romo to the field as rookie quarterback Dak Prescott rested after playing just two series in the game . Tony Romo made his return to the field for the Cowboys but came up with a loss against the Eagles . [ Image by Rich Schultz/Getty Images ] As ESPN reported , Dallas lost 27-13 to the Philadelphia Eagles in Romo 's first action in several months . The Cowboys are still top seed in the NFC with home field advantage throughout the playoffs , and will end the regular season as No . 2 in the power rankings . Their biggest concern heading into the postseason is n't their quarterback decision but hoping they avoid the New York Giants . Eli Manning and the Giants have given the Cowboys two of their three losses this season . Beyond that , Dallas never played the Seattle Seahawks or Atlanta Falcons this season which could pose some interesting matchups with experienced personnel . In terms of teams that could give the Patriots some trouble , it could be either the No . 3 or No . 4 team in the power rankings . The Kansas City Chiefs won 12 games for their season and put together a nice campaign . One team they never had on their schedule this past year was New England , so if the two teams meet in the playoffs it could get interesting . The Steelers have been on an absolute tear , winning seven straight games to close out their season , giving them the No . 3 spot in the latest rankings . NFL Power Rankings Week 18 1 . New England Patriots 14-2 ( No . 1 )
2 . Dallas Cowboys 13-3 ( No . 2 )
3 . Pittsburgh Steelers 11-5 ( No . 6 )
4 . Kansas City Chiefs 12-4 ( No . 3 )
5 . Green Bay Packers 10-6 ( No . 9 )
6 . Oakland Raiders 12-4 ( No . 4 )
7 . Atlanta Falcons 11-5 ( No . 8 )
8 . New York Giants 11-5 ( No . 7 )
9 . Seattle Seahawks 10-5-1 ( No . 5 )
10 . Detroit Lions 10-6 ( N/A ) During the early action on Sunday , the Washington Redskins blew their chances at a playoff spot by losing 19-10 to the New York Giants . That meant that both the Detroit Lions and Green Bay Packers punched their tickets to the postseason ahead of their Sunday Night Football showdown . The game took place at Ford Field in Detroit , with a close contest going on down the stretch . Matthew Stafford tossed a touchdown pass to Anquan Boldin late in the fourth quarter to cut the Packers ' lead to a touchdown . Unfortunately for the Lions their onside kick attempt with 13 seconds left was recovered by Green Bay , giving them the win and the division title . Rodgers and the Packers have been hot to close out the season , winning their last six games , pushing them into the top five of the rankings . While Detroit has dropped their last few to finish the season on a disappointing note , they find themselves reclaiming a spot in the Top 10 . As of this report , Miami has issues in terms of the quarterback position which could make them an easy out for the Pittsburgh Steelers when the playoffs get going . Miami and Houston are two playoff teams below the top 10 as of this report based on recent weeks of play . The Green Bay Packers have been one of the hottest teams in the NFL , winning six straight . [ Image by Gregory Shamus/Getty Images ] The playoffs get going this coming weekend for many teams . Sunday 's win by the Packers means that Green Bay will take on New York in the Wild Card round of the playoffs , while Detroit has to face a tough Seattle team . Meanwhile , the Cowboys and Falcons will have a bye to start things off . On the AFC side , the byes go to the Patriots and Chiefs , as the Raiders vs. Texans and Dolphins vs. Steelers will all compete in the Wild Card round during the upcoming weekend . It 's been an interesting season to say the least , with several major contenders emerging , and some of the usual suspects looking to challenge them . Veteran quarterbacks have guided their teams to the playoffs with Rodgers , Manning , Brady , Roethlisberger , and Wilson all among those who have captured at least one Super Bowl trophy before . Will one of these teams win it , or will someone new such as the rookie-led Cowboys win it all ? [ Featured Image by Mike Ehrmann/Getty Images ]

Despite defeating the Rams 43-35 on Sunday , the Eagles lost QB Carson Wentz to a knee injury that is being reported as a possible torn ACL . ( 0:49 )
LOS ANGELES -- Carson Wentz was the first person to greet his teammates as they filed into the tiny visitors locker room at the Coliseum to begin the celebration .
The Philadelphia Eagles had overcome the loss of their leader and beaten the Los Angeles Rams in a wild 43-35 shootout -- clinching the division in the process . Wentz , who was wearing a big , black brace around his left knee and an `` NFC East Champs '' hat , congratulated his teammates one by one as they walked through the door .
`` I just told him when I saw him at the stairwell , 'We did that for you , man , ' '' safety Rodney McLeod said .
`` He just gave me a smile and just said , 'Good job . ' Short and simple . ''
A few moments later , Wentz was loaded onto a cart and driven up the hill toward the team bus . He walked the last few paces himself , disappearing behind the iron fence and into the night .
play 0:17 Foles says Wentz means a lot to him Eagles QB Nick Foles explains how much Carson Wentz means to the team and that Foles trust in the Eagles to overcome whatever the results of Wentz 's injury turns out to be .
Players seemed to be wrestling with two conflicting emotions : Joy over accomplishing a team goal in exhilarating fashion , and sadness over potentially losing Wentz in the process . Like many , they are awaiting the results of an MRI on Monday to see if his ACL is torn , and preparing for the worst while hoping for the best .
Interestingly , though , no one came across as deflated . If anything stood out in the postgame swirl , it was the team 's resolve .
`` We got the win for him . We 're going to move on and whatever happens , happens . Next-man up mentality , '' McLeod said . `` That 's been the story of us this entire season . We 're not going to miss a beat at all and we 're just going to keep this thing rolling . ''
In order to do so , they 'll need quality play out of backup Nick Foles , whose story has come full circle . A third-round pick by Philly in 2012 , Foles started 24 games over three seasons for the Eagles , including 10 in 2013 when he threw an improbable 27 touchdowns to two interceptions . He came crashing back down to earth as the surprise element of Chip Kelly 's offense wore off . Foles had an average year in 2014 , struggled in 2015 after being traded to the then St. Louis Rams , was benched and then later released . He served as a backup for the Kansas City Chiefs last season before taking on the same role in Philadelphia this season .
It now looks like he could be back at the controls , and in charge of leading a first-place team with Super Bowl aspirations .

`` I 'm absolutely ready , '' said Foles , who went 6-of-10 for 42 yards in a relief appearance against his former squad . `` That 's why I 'm here . I 'm ready to go . Prepare every day , work every day so I 'm ready to go if need be . ''
The dropoff from Wentz to Foles is undeniable . Wentz was a legitimate MVP candidate and playing the position about as well as anyone in the league . Immediately , the conversation began externally : Which NFC team should be considered the favorite should Wentz be sidelined for the season ? The 10-3 Minnesota Vikings are a popular choice .
It should be noted , though , that the Vikings are essentially on their third choice at quarterback . Sam Bradford was the guy before he got hurt , and the idea was to insert Teddy Bridgewater into the lineup when he got healthy . Case Keenum , however , has played too well to justify the move . They were written off when injury struck the most important position , but have found a way to make it work thanks in large part to a stout defense and deep roster .
The Eagles believe that , with tweaks to their approach , they can accentuate different strengths and maintain a high level of play .
`` Offensively , there 's going to be some things that we 'll probably change around just because Nick does n't have some of the abilities of Carson when you talk about mobility and all of that , '' safety Malcolm Jenkins said .
`` Going to run the ball more and rely on these great backs that we have on the team . Our defense needs to step up and be the defense that we 've been all year . ''
At season 's end , they might look back at this December night in Los Angeles and concede it was the beginning of the end to their championship run . In this moment , they 're pushing forward believing they have enough good players to get the job done .
`` At the end of the day , it does n't change any of our goals , '' Jenkins said . `` It sucks , more so for Carson as a person , as a friend and as a teammate , and what he puts into the game , his preparation , to not have him or to see him go down in that fashion , right where we are on a night like this , it sucks for him . But as a team , we still have all our goals out in front of us . ''
Jul 31 , 2017 ; Palo Alto , CA , USA ; Maria Sharapova ( RUS ) waves to the crowd after winning against Jennifer Brady ( USA ) in the Bank of the West Classic tennis tournament at Stanford University . Mandatory Credit : Stan Szeto-USA TODAY Sports
( Reuters ) - Maria Sharapova has withdrawn from the Cincinnati Open with a nagging left arm injury she suffered during competition earlier this month , the former champion said on Sunday .
Sharapova , who suffered the injury during her first-round match at the Stanford Classic , said her decision to withdraw from the Cincinnati event , which granted her a wildcard , was a precaution ahead of the year 's final grand slam .
The 2011 champion said she arrived in Cincinnati on Saturday eager to play but following the doctor 's advice on site decided to withdraw from the U.S. Open tune-up , where first-round action begins on Monday .
Sharapova was scheduled to play French Open champion and world number 12 Jelena Ostapenko in a highly-anticipated first-round clash .
The Russian 's decision to withdraw marks the latest setback in her comeback this year after a 15-month doping ban .
Sharapova , banned after testing positive for the heart drug meldonium at the 2016 Australian Open , has had mixed results since rejoining the WTA Tour .
The 30-year-old reached the semi-finals as a wildcard in Stuttgart , fell in the second round at Madrid and retired from her second-round match at the Italian Open in mid-May after injuring her left thigh .
After pulling out of Stanford , Sharapova withdrew from the Rogers Cup in Toronto .
The arm injury casts a cloud on Sharapova competing in the Aug. 28-Sept. 10 U.S. Open since the former world number one would need a wildcard to compete in the event .
There 's no place like home for the Dallas Stars , who are 10-4-0 at the American Airlines Center this season . They struggled mightily away from Dallas last season , posting a disappointing 12-24-5 road record , and are 6-9-1 as visitors so far in 2017-18 .
The Stars left town after practice Sunday , heading east on a tough four-game tour of the Metropolitan Division . They hope to end their three-game losing skid Monday night in New York , where they 'll face the Rangers at Madison Square Garden . The visiting Stars are 5-3-0 in their last eight games at MSG , and there 's a simple explanation for their success at “ The World 's Most Famous Arena ” : they love playing there .
Spezza Thrives on MSG “ Buzz ”
“ MSG is pretty electric and feels special to be playing there , ” said Stars center Jason Spezza . “ It 's kind of the same with Montreal , there 's always a little bit of a buzz . ”
The veteran forward , who named Madison Square Garden and Montreal 's Bell Centre as his favorite road arenas , was asked whether visiting players feed off the atmosphere in those venues .
“ Yeah , I think you get a little more jacked up , ” said Spezza . “ You get heckled a little bit , there 's a buzz around the rink…I like it when the fans are a little bit on top of you and those two rinks , the fans are on top of you a little bit more , so it makes it a little more hostile environment , makes it fun to play .
Clearly , Spezza enjoys playing the Garden : He 's put up 5-5-10 in his last six games there and leads all Stars in career goals , assists and points at MSG , with 13-20-33 in 38 contests .
Seguin Likes It Loud
Stars center Tyler Seguin echoed his teammate 's comments .
“ I like MSG , I like Chicago , I like Montreal…that 's probably my top three , ” said Seguin . “ It 's just the atmosphere . I like loud places . MSG is more about the history , Chicago and Montreal the atmosphere . The fans are great and it 's always very loud . Whether you 're at home or the visiting team , you still get excited with how loud it is . ”
Surprisingly , the superstar has just one career goal in 19 games against the Rangers , and that came when he was with the Boston Bruins . The only other team Seguin 's scored one goal against ? The Vegas Golden Knights ( he 's never scored on the Anaheim Ducks , but we 'll get into that another time ) .
The Stars ' need to end their losing streak adds pressure to this road trip . With that in mind , Seguin was asked why it 's harder for teams in general ( not just the Stars ) to win on the road . He pondered the question before answering .
“ It 's generally comfortable at home , ” said Seguin . “ You just have so much knowledge of things that have gone right and wrong at home that you just kind of trigger it and it does n't matter who you 're playing , and on the road…The fans , the momentum , it 's harder to grab because there 's 20,000 people on one team 's side , and it always makes it trickier to win on the road . You have to really simplify on the road to have success . ”
Bishop Loves Broadway
Count The World 's Tallest Goalie as another fan of The World 's Most Famous Arena .
“ Yeah , Madison Square Garden . Probably that and Chicago are my two favorite places on the road , ” said Stars netminder Ben Bishop . “ New York , it 's kind of like , ‘ Broadway ! ' You kind of feel like you 're on a stage . It 's a neat arena , because it 's got a lot of history to it and good atmosphere . They 've played a lot of pretty significant games in that arena , so you have a lot of competitive juices [ flowing ] when you think about it . ”
Kari Lehtonen will start for the Stars against the Rangers , so Bishop will be a well-paid and well-padded spectator at MSG Monday night .
Big Ben was also asked about home versus road games . Maybe it 's because Bishop 's a goalie , and goalies see the game differently , but he does n't see a difference between home and road contests .
“ I do n't think it really is [ different ] . I mean , maybe just the home confines , your own crowd , but…it 's the same game , ” said Bishop . “ There 's really nothing different , so it should n't be any easier or harder . It 's the same game ; you get the last change [ as the home team ] , but that 's about it . I do n't think it 's necessarily harder . I do n't think it 's mental , it 's just a matter of going out there and doing it . ”
Hitchcock 's Diplomatic Disclosure
After talking to the players , I was curious as to whether Stars head coach Ken Hitchcock had a favorite road arena . Hitch contemplated the question for a few moments before answering .
“ I 'm more partial to the older ones because they had character and they were n't cookie-cutter , ” said the coach . “ But some of the new ones that have a ‘ wow factor , ' like the arena in Edmonton 's got a ‘ wow factor ' that 's incredible . For me , it 's more the arenas that have kept their stature and their style and their grace , even though they 're older arenas . ”
Hitchcock continued , working in a plug for the Stars ' home arena while sprinkling compliments around the league as smoothly as any politician .
“ To me , there 's no better looking arena than American Airlines [ Center ] , because they 've kept that arena in immaculate shape for us , which is really nice to see , ” said Hitch . “ It 's 15 years old and it looks brand new . It 's the same as the arena in Philadelphia . Those are the ones that really , really impress me , the way that they look despite being 20 years old . But looking at the new ones that are coming out now , like the one in Edmonton has a lot of conveniences that are really fan-friendly , like Detroit , everybody talks about how great Detroit is for the fans . Those are the ones . ”
One thing is clear : If the whole hockey thing does n't work out , Ken Hitchcock has a bright future in politics .

Britain 's justice ministry said he had died in hospital . “ As with all deaths in custody there will be an investigation by the independent Prisons and Probation Ombudsman . Our condolences are with Mr. Clifford 's family at this difficult time , ” a prison service spokeswoman said in a statement .
The BBC said it understood that the 74-year-old had collapsed in his cell on Thursday while trying to clean it , then again the following day .
Clifford 's conviction in 2014 was the first from an inquiry into historical sex abuse triggered by reports that the late BBC TV presenter Jimmy Savile had been a prolific sex offender for decades .
Clifford , whose clients had included TV music mogul Simon Powell and U.S. boxer Muhammad Ali , was found guilty of eight counts of indecently assaulting four girls aged 14 to 19 between 1977 and 1984 .
He had denied all charges , saying the allegations were “ utterly repulsive ” lies by fantasists and opportunists .
TOKYO , Aug 14 ( Reuters ) - Japan 's economy expanded at an annualised rate of 4.0 percent in April-June , posting a sixth straight quarter of expansion led by private consumption and capital expenditure , government data showed on Monday .
That marked the fastest pace of growth since January-March 2015 .
The preliminary reading for second-quarter gross domestic product ( GDP ) compared with a median estimate for a 2.5 percent annualised increase in a Reuters poll of economists .
It followed a revised 1.5 percent annualised rate of expansion in the prior quarter , Cabinet Office data showed .
On a quarter-on-quarter basis , GDP rose 1.0 percent , against a 0.6 percent rise expected by economists .

The 19th edition of the Karpov Poikovsky International began on 27 May , 2018 in Poikovsky , a small Siberian town in Russia . The 10 player round-robin is being played with a time control of 100 minutes for 40 moves , followed by 50 minutes for 20 moves and then 15 minutes until the end of the game , with a 30-second increment from move 1 . The field is headlined by the Russian star , GM Ian Nepomniachtchi and includes a strong line-up of players like Dmitry Jakovenko , Anton Korobov , Boris Gelfand and so forth .
The only Indian representative in the field is India 's rising star , GM Vidit Gujrathi . This is the first time that Vidit has been invited to be a part of such a strong closed event . If he performs well here , this might attract him invites to more such closed events .
In the first round , Gujrathi 's game against Victor Bologan was the first one to finish . By rating , Vidit was , of course , the favourite , with almost 100 points over the Moldovan GM . But Bologan 's experience could not have been discounted . Besides , unlike Vidit , who is playing the tournament for the first time , Bologan is no newcomer to Poikovsky ; he has played and won this event more than once .
The game began as a Queen 's Indian where Vidit , after a slight misplay in the opening by Bologan , began mounting pressure on black 's position . Planting a knight deep into enemy lines on c6 , Vidit conjured up an elegant kingside attack . The highlight of the game was Vidit 's exchange sac on move 25 which was very reminiscent of the positional sacrifices of the twelfth world champion in whose honour the tournament is conducted .
Five moves later , Bologan resigned . It seemed at first that the resignation might have come too early . But a closer look at the final position reveals that black is utterly paralyzed and playing on would only delay the inevitable .
After his amazing first round win , Vidit Gujrathi looked a little ambitious in the second round as well . With the black pieces , he essayed the Sicilian Najdorf . But his opponent , Vladislav Kovalev , decided to keep things solid and went for the 6.g3 line .
Kovalev seemed to have had the advantage out of the opening but was n't able to find the best continuations . By the 30th move , Vidit had achieved complete equality with a tactical shot . In the exchanges that ensued , Kovalev was down an exchange but all his pieces were ideally placed to force a draw by perpetual checks .
This round also saw the top seed of the tournament , Ian Nepomniachtchi , speed past his rivals . While all the other games of the round were drawn , ‘ Nepo ' conducted an excellent kingside attack against the tournament 's defending champion , Emil Sutovsky , in a French Defence game to bring down the Israeli GM .
The third round of the event witnessed a faceoff between Gujrathi and the tournament leader , Ian Nepomniachtchi . Having won back to back games in the last two rounds and with an almost 40 point rating advantage over Vidit , Nepomniachtchi was surely the favourite to win the game .
But Vidit also had certain trumps in his favour . For starters , Vidit had the white pieces . Also , Vidit 's opening preparation has always been top notch and it was n't an easy task for Nepomniachtchi to achieve a trifecta with the black pieces in hand . Moreover , these are only the early stages of the tournament and there was no need for Nepomniachtchi to push too hard for a win . One rash move is all it would take for Vidit to turn the tables in his favour .
Vidit opened with the non-committal knight move 1.Nf3 . The Russian GM answered by moving his queen 's pawn two squares and soon a Queen 's Gambit position was reached . Nepomniachtchi tried unsettling his young Indian opponent by thrusting his king knight pawn two squares forward on his 8th turn , thus uncorking a novelty . Vidit reacted well by stopping any further advance of the g pawn and then breaking open the queenside .
Neponiachtchi answered this with a pawn break in the center and this led to a complete liquidation . Having exchanged queens and two sets of minor pieces , an equal endgame was reached by move 20 and players agreed to a draw at this point .
Meanwhile , the second seed of the tournament , Dmitry Jakovenko benefitted from the endgame error of Emil Sutovsky in the third round to win his second game of the tournament . With this win , he was able to join Nepomniachtchi in the lead .
With a score of 2.0/3 , Gujrathi still remains half-a-point behind the leaders , Ian Neppomniachtchi and Dmitry Jakovenko . But there are still six more rounds to go . Vidit has not only remained undefeated so far but has also played some really strong chess in Poikovsky . If he could carve out a few wins in the remaining rounds whilst keeping up his solid style of play , he is sure to finish atop the leaderboard of this prestigious event .
Personality-wise the guy is just an immature self absorbed self righteous punk , but he is right about almost everything he says concerning basic politics , economy and military , however once he starts delving off into his own brand of `` Christianity '' with it 's contradictory modern American `` god '' of 'rebellion ' , made in Alex ' own image , he is actually serving the devil . He always says he is still alive because of his loud voice , but in truth he is still alive because he is a tool of the cabal , he does n't know it , like atheists and other useful idiots led by their own desires more than the truth of Scripture , he is an unknowing pawn of the devil .
In today 's show he again tries to make a distinction between `` good '' masons and bad masons and `` good '' illuminati and bad illuminati , he is willfully ignorant that there is no such thing as a `` good '' freemasonry or a `` good '' illuminati . When someone tries to reason with him about the Scriptural facts he starts raging and interrupting and calling people `` pig demon '' which is nearly as spiritually dangerous as the pharisees accusing CHRIST of working from evil .
While I agree with most of his general news points , though he is often quite naive to the true scope and motivations and definitely to how he himself is manipulated and used to serve the bad , I ca n't stand his childish spoiled 'only son ' personality and in the balances he winds up doing more bad than good because we must remember that the whole battle boils down to a spiritual one and every time a soul is deceived into having false beliefs , that is the true objective of the evil side .
Tl ; dr : Alex is willfully ignorant and false about spiritual matters , but with discernment on the part of the listener , he can be useful as a reporter and simplistic analyzer of geopolitical events . However in the balances he comes out more evil than good and needs a good humbling .
One win down , one to go for Taylor Swift and her mom .
On Friday , a Federal Judge determined that former DJ , David Mueller , did not prove that Swift personally got him fired . Mueller had alleged this in his three million dollar lawsuit and the judge tossed out that portion of the suit .
Identical allegations against Taylor 's mom , Andrea Swift , and one of Taylor 's employees , Frank Bell , are still active and expected to go to jurors today after lawyers make their closing arguments .
On Friday , Swift 's bodyguard , Greg Dent , took the stand and testified that he was standing a few feet away during the photo op which clearly shows Mueller 's hand on Swift 's lower region as opposed to the rib cage area Mueller claims he was touching .
Dent says he saw Mueller grope Swift , but did not take immediate action because he generally took his cues from Swift and she gave him none . Plus , she has told him in the past not to be so mean to her fans .
And Arnold Schwarzenegger confirmed his role in Terminator 6 , but it 's not what you think .
He will not be reprising his iconic role T-800 Model 101 . Instead , James Cameron ( who is penning the trilogy ) says he will most likely play the human that was the inspiration for the T-800 Model 101 's appearance .
Cameron says “ Now the question is , did that person have some sort of meaning to Skynet on why they chose that one , ( Arnold ) . ”
Cameron says we will have to wait to see the movie to find out .

The Humboldt Broncos head coach , who was one of 16 killed in a bus crash , was once the Bonnyville Pontiacs most improved player .
During that 1994-95 season , Darcy Haugan was ranked third in scoring after improving his skills and had 49 points in 38 games .
The following year with the Pontiacs , he played 21 games and had 28 points to his name .
Those who knew Haugan back then , remember him as being very dedicated to hockey .
Haugan was a defenceman who played minor hockey in northern Alberta . He later played junior hockey with the Alberta Junior Hockey League , not only for the Pontiacs , but the Fort Saskatchewan Traders .
He would also go onto play for the Estevan Bruins in the Saskatchewan Junior Hockey League .
Humboldt Broncos team president Kevin Garinger called Haugan a great coach and a great man .
“ Unbelievable coach , ” says Garinger . “ The epitome of Darcy Haugan is probably summed up in his own words when he talked about the fact that he believes so strongly that hockey is not about making hockey players , it 's about making men and I think really what he focused on . He made great young people out of kids who
wanted to be hockey players .
They also developed those hockey skills along with that . ”
Haugan — who is among 16 people who are confirmed deceased from the bus crash tragedy on Apr . 6 — was into his third year as head coach and general manager of the Broncos .
“ That team was just a whole bunch of incredible young men and you must credit that to Darcy and his leadership for everything he did with them , ” adds Garinger . “ He was an incredible mentor . ”
Haugan took over the Saskatchewan Junior Hockey League team on short notice , prior to the 2015-16 season when he took over from Ryan Smith , who accepted a job with the WHL 's Swift Current Broncos .
A native of Peace River , Haugan and his wife Christina , who is employed as office manager for the Broncos , have two boys , Carson and Jackson , who have called Humboldt home since Christmas of 2015 .
In Haugan 's first season , the Broncos missed the playoffs for the first time in 36 years with a 17-36-4-1 record , but Haugan turned the team 's fortunes around to guide the team to a 31-35-1-1 record last season and 33-19-3-3 record this season .
“ ( He turned things around ) in a year , basically , ” said Garinger . “ When he got here , it was a struggle but within the second year , it was unbelievable . I knew ( deceased assistant coach ) Mark Cross really well , and I know his mom and dad really well , and Mark would always talk to me about how he was in love with what was going on in the organization because he was learning so much from Darcy . ”
After playing junior hockey , Haugan received a scholarship to play hockey at Northern Michigan University . After one season , he returned home and obtained a power-engineering diploma while playing hockey for two seasons at Briercrest College .
Haugan spent a short time playing professionally in Sweden before returning home to join the coaching ranks as an assistant coach and then interim head coach with the Estevan Bruins .
After 12 seasons of leading the North Peace Navigators of the Northwest Junior Hockey League , where he was coach of the year from 2011-2013 , he returned to the SJHL to coach the Broncos .
“ I have to admit I was very content , very comfortable where I was , ” Haugan was previously quoted in an SJHL website story . “ We had been able to establish a very successful program and my two boys were a block away from their grandparents .
But , when this opened up it was a real easy decision to put my name in and when they called back to offer me the job there was a bit of a lump in my stomach . I 'm very honoured , very privileged , very humbled , very motivated to live up to the past history of this club . ”
BLOOMINGTON , Ind . ( AP ) Matt McQuaid scored 12 points and made the decisive 3-pointer with 1:08 to play Saturday night , leading No . 5 Michigan State past Indiana 63-60 .
The Spartans ( 22-3 , 10-2 Big Ten ) have won six straight to stay two games behind Purdue in the conference title chase .
Juwan Morgan had 23 points and 11 rebounds for Indiana ( 12-12 , 5-7 ) , which has lost four straight overall . Freddie McSwain Jr. finished with eight points and 16 rebounds .
Indiana , which lost to the Spartans 85-57 earlier this season , had a chance to force overtime , but Devonte Green 's 70-foot heave bounced high off the back of the rim as the buzzer sounded .
It was deliberate , old-school basketball at its finest .
The teams regularly went deep into the shot clock , and Michigan State eventually hung on because of size and defense .
Despite shooting a season-low 28.8 percent from the field , the Hoosiers sure made it tough .
Indiana trailed 58-50 with 5:05 left before Morgan scored seven straight points to get the Hoosiers within one . After Miles Bridges missed a 17-footer on Michigan State 's next possession , Indiana had a chance to take the lead . But Robert Johnson 's layup rolled out and McSwain missed two free throws after grabbing the offensive rebound .
McQuaid 's final 3 made it a four-point game and after Green 's three-point play with 3.7 seconds to go made it 63-60 , the Hoosiers got one last chance when Joshua Langford missed two free throws .
Langford and Jaren Jackson Jr. each had 10 points and Jackson finished with seven blocks .
BIG PICTURE
Michigan State : Offensively , the Spartans struggled . But defensively , they showed just how good they can be with their size and length . Just eight minutes into the game , Michigan State had eight blocks . It finished the half with nine with 13 . The only downfall was that the Hoosiers took advantage of second chances and managed to keep it close .
Indiana : After getting blown out by the Spartans on Jan. 19 in East Lansing , the Hoosiers inserted McSwain into the starting lineup and turned it around . No , they did n't get the win . But the young Hoosiers showed how much they had learned from the first matchup and they can go toe-to-toe with any team .
KEY STATS
Michigan State : Bridges finished with seven points and eight rebounds . … . Langford had 10 points . … The Spartans pushed their single-season school record for blocks to 204 . … Michigan State was 9 of 18 on 3s and 8 of 17 on free throws .
Indiana : Morgan recorded his seventh double-double of the season . … The Hoosiers made only 2 of its first 22 shots , 9.1 percent , and went more than 8 1/2 minutes in the first half without a basket . …Indiana had a 53-29 rebounding edge including a 25-3 advantage on the offensive end against the best rebounding team in Division I . … The Hoosiers have played three straight ranked opponents .

The senator representing Ogun West , Buruji Kashamu , yesterday said the dissolution of the executive council of the Peoples Democratic Party ( PDP ) in Ogun State and Southwest will not work because the party 's national leadership violated a court order with its decision .
The senator , who was reacting to the decision of PDP the highest decision making body , the National Convention , last Saturday , which dissolved the executive councils , said the action was a clear travesty of justice .
Kashamu , in a statement yesterday said that a court judgment which recognises the executive councils in Ogun and Southwest was never appealed .
The Federal High Court , Abuja , on August 11 ruled : “ That an order is hereby made restraining the 2nd Defendant from operating in the South West zone of the party through any committee in which the applicant , Chief Pegba Otemolu and Chief Makanjuola Ogundipe are not members in the capacity of the Secretary and Chairman respectively of the South West Zonal Executive of the PDP pending the hearing and determination of the motion on notice .
“ That an order of interim injunction is made restraining the 2nd Defendant by itself , its officers , organs and delegates from recognizing any harmonization , restructuring or disruption of the PDP leadership structures in the South West zone ( including any purported list of delegates for the special non-elective National Convention of the PDP schedule for the 12th of August , 2017 or any other date during the tenure of office of the South West Zonal Executive Committee of which the Applicant is secretary pending the hearing and determination of the motion on notice . ”
The senator maintained that the National Caretaker Committee , and National Convention , did n't heed to the court order
He said : “ It should be abundantly clear to all that Eddy Olafeso never had any case before the Supreme Court that he could benefit from .
“ While it could be argued that the congress in Lagos State was inconclusive , the dissolution of the state executives in Osun and Ogun states was a clear travesty of justice . The congresses of these states were affirmed by the NEC before the May 21 , 2016 botched convention in Port Harcourt .
“ At its 74th NEC meeting held on the 17th of July , 2017 , the NEC resolved to reinstate all the State Excos that were elected at the April 2016 congresses but later reversed after the February , 17 , 2017 judgment of the Court of Appeal . Ogun and Osun states were not listed as part of those states .
“ So , what has changed ? Why were the state executives in Ondo and Ekiti states left untouched ? Are these executives not also dogged with issues ? In Osun State , Omisore wants to perpetually hold on to the party structure , at the detriment of the over 90 % of the stakeholders , in order to push through his governorship ambition even when he has failed twice . In Ogun State , OGD and Ladi Adebutu are fomenting trouble in the party , all because of their senatorial and governorship ambitions in 2019 . In Lagos State , Chief Bode George seeks to hold on to the party structure even when he has not been able to win his polling booth since 1999 ! In Ekiti and Ondo states , the party is divided 50/50 . Now , Ekiti is left in the hands of one man . No one is talking of harmonisation in Ekiti and Ondo states . They dissolved the excos in Ogun , Osun and Lagos states to satisfy Ayo Fayose , Iyiola Omisore , OGD and Chief George . What an injustice ! What a double standard ! ”
Kashamu said , “ The supremacy of any party 's constitution is subject to the provision of the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria as clearly stated in Chapter 1 , section 2 of our party 's constitution . ”
He added : “ The Ogun State PDP Executive under the leadership of Engr . Adebayo Dayo has a court judgment and orders legitimising it as the duly and validly elected State Executive until 2020 . This clearly allows the Engr . Adebayo Dayo-led executive to remain in office and carry out all its due responsibilities and functions .
“ For the above reasons , the Dayo-led Exco will remain in office till 2020 regardless of its purported dissolution , because the action taken by the NEC and convention of our great party is an illegal act . You can not build something on nothing and expect it to stand .
“ I believe that the so-called dissolution of the Dayo-led Ogun State Exco never took place . It was not the authentic State Exco that was dissolved . Rather , it was the parallel structure being promoted by the impostors that was dissolved .
“ I understand that the amateurs are misconstruing a Supreme Court judgment that says it is only the national leadership that can submit names to the regulatory agency , the Independent National Electoral Commission ( INEC ) .
“ While this may be true , it does not mean that the national body would just write names from the air and submit to INEC . It has to conduct primaries at a congress to be chaired by the State Chairman of the respective state executive . Anytime the national leadership fails to comply with this constitutional provision , it will always run into a cul-de-sac .
“ The Supreme Court could not have given the NWC , NEC or the convention the right to disregard due process , court orders or judgments . It can not encourage anyone or any institution to be above the law . The constitution of the PDP and PDP itself are products of the laws of the Federal Republic of Nigeria . Therefore , the convention conducted on the 12th of August , 2017 , with illegal delegates , and the decisions taken at the meeting can not stand because they were done in defiance of valid court orders and judgments . ”

New Delhi : Disgruntled BJP leader Shatrughan Sinha on Thursday yet again backed party veteran LK Advani as the most deserving candidate for the post of president , saying he was physically fit and has the ability to `` understand the complexity of the Constitution '' .
Sinha tweeted that ,
As the D-day for the Presidential election draws close , I strongly echo the views of Advani ji 's admirers and well wishers ... 9 > 10 — Shatrughan Sinha ( @ ShatruganSinha ) June 13 , 2017
He is clearly the most suitable , learned , respectable , experienced , desirable and deserving candidate for the most prestigious post ... 10 > 11 — Shatrughan Sinha ( @ ShatruganSinha ) June 13 , 2017
Sinha 's remarks came as a three-member BJP committee is to meet Congress president Sonia Gandhi and other opposition leaders to evolve a consensus for NDA candidate .
Sinha also said that Advani , who is 89 , is `` physically fit '' for the post and no one has come out against his candidature .
`` No one is able to speak anything , be it from within or outside the party . No voice coming out against Advani 's candidature . Advaniji is much more healthy and energetic than any of the young leaders . He has kept himself maintained so that he can take responsibility of the country '' , Sinha said .
Sinha has been sidelined in the party after Narendra Modi became prime minister of the country . He was also not inducted into Modi 's council of ministers though he has claimed of long association with the BJP , since the time when the party had two members in the Lok Sabha .
His proximity to Advani is said to be one of the reasons for being sidelined in the BJP .
During the Bihar Assembly polls , Sinha had spoken in favour of JD ( U ) president and Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar . He does not enjoy good relations with Bihar BJP leaders , including former deputy chief minister Sushil Kumar Modi .
Sinha had on Tuesday described Advani as `` Pitamah '' of the BJP , saying that he most richly deserves to be President of the country .

Breakthrough in Gulf War illnesses from exposure to chemical toxins
The symptoms include severe fatigue , stomach problems and body aches just to name a few . One out of three soldiers who fought in Operation Desert Storm are affected . Now new research is aimed at bringing some relief .
Jimmy Arocho is a Gulf War veteran .
“ I was seven months in the desert , ” said Arocho , Sergeant First Class ( retired ) in the United States Army .
Shortly after coming home , his health took a turn for the worse .
Arocho continued , “ Full body pain , muscle and joint pain . ”
Nancy Klimas , MD , Director of the Gulf War Illness Program at Miami VA Hospital and Director of the Institute for Neuro Immune Medicine at Nova Southeastern University said , “ In 1990 and 91 , we sent 800,000 U.S . Troops to the Middle East to fight in the first Gulf War . ”
Dr. Klimas says those soldiers were exposed to multiple chemical toxins including organophosphate in their uniforms .
Dr. Klimas said , “ Out of 800,000 troops some 300,000 veterans are now ill 27 years later , so one in three came back ill and stayed that way . ”
Dr. Klimas and her team at Nova Southeastern University and the Miami VA went to work to find a treatment for Gulf War illness and the debilitating symptoms . They put study participants on bikes and measured their body 's responses and found their systems were off balance .
“ In this particular study we 're using a biologic intervention , ” Dr. Klimas told Ivanhoe .
She says the goal is a healthy homeostasis , bringing the immune , endocrine and autonomic nervous systems back in balance . The study has moved to phase one in humans . Jimmy hopes this research will finally lead to some relief for his fellow soldiers .
“ I really want to see an effective treatment across all of what is causing the gulf war illness , ” Arocho said .
Despite his own pain , Arocho travelled to Puerto Rico to help hurricane victims . Once a soldier always a civil servant .
Dr. Klimas believes a treatment for Gulf War illness will be available in about five years , most likely in the form of an injection . In addition to Nova , four other sites received federal funding for clinical trials on Gulf War illness including Boston University , the Bronx VA , the Palo Alto VA and the New Jersey VA.

It 's pitched as an adventurous getaway into the great outdoors but if you 're not used to roughing it , camping can seem taxing .
That 's where Parks Canada 's Learn to Camp program — which is essentially Camping 101 — comes into play .
“ Often there are barriers that stop people from just giving it a shot … when they do [ to Learn to Camp program ] , people get more comfortable with the outdoors , they get curious about camping and they gain that confidence to give it another shot on their own , ” Parks Canada spokesperson Laura Judson said .
The opportunity is open to those new to camping and those new to the country .

“ We provide gear as well as a lot of our staff go in and do workshops on , say , how to set up a tent or how to start up a stove or how to cook a meal at camping , ” Mountain Equipment Co-op spokesperson Elyse Curley said .
It 's also a way for refugees and immigrants to explore their new home .
“ They 'll give camping a shot even if they 've had really negative associations with tents and unstable housing in the past , ” Judson said .
Originally from Iran and now living in Victoria , Nadji Yazdi and his family are planning to take part in Learn to Camp this summer .

It will be the second time they are participating .
“ I think the best thing about the program is you have a fear about doing something for the first time and it breaks that fear because there are experts around , they 're knowledgeable , they help you if you have questions , ” Yazdi said .
The weekend events are held in national parks across the country .

A family has been left ‘ extremely distressed ' after vandals scrawled obscene graffiti on a memorial seat at a popular beauty spot .
Fleet Pond Society chairman Colin Gray said the family , who do not wish to be named , had gathered to celebrate Christmas and remember a husband and father much missed as he passed away at Christmas time .
“ The family had wanted to place a memorial to a man who had loved Fleet Pond and they had sponsored a seat on one of his favourite viewpoints , overlooking the Wellington reedbed near Wellington Road , ” said Mr Gray .
“ To bring back memories of the happy times when he was still with them , they went to the viewpoint to sit and enjoy his favourite view .

“ But vandals had covered the seat in obscene graffiti in black felt tip pen or marker .
“ Thus what was to have been a time of happy memories was ruined by this mindless act .
“ The whole family is extremely distressed . If anyone knows who might have been responsible please let us know . ”
Mr Gray said a Fleet Pond Society volunteer has scrubbed out the words .
Anyone with information about who is responsible for the graffiti can call Mr Gray on 01252 616183 .

Union receives almost 2000 complaints after Smith City ruling
MARION VAN DIJK/STUFF Spark , Max Fashions , Life Pharmacy , Jeans West , Hannahs , and JB Hi-Fi have allegedly had employees complaining about work without pay .
A union representing retail workers has received fresh complaints against some of the country 's biggest retailers .
It brings the total number of complaints to nearly 2000 , after the Smiths City Employment Court decision earlier this month .
In May it was revealed the court had ordered the national retailer to backpay staff on or near the minimum wage for six years ' worth of unpaid morning meetings .
First Union released a second list of companies alleged to require staff to work unpaid . It included Max Fashions , Life Pharmacy , Jeans West , Hannahs , Spark , and JB Hi-Fi . The six organisations have been contacted by Stuff .
Retail , finance and commerce secretary Tali Williams said employees in the retail sector were already on low wages and could not afford to work for free .

`` Companies need to consider the wellbeing of their employees and their obligations to the law . They will be publicly shamed if they do n't make fixing this a priority , '' Williams said .
The union said staff alleged their employers had been expecting , and in some instances verbally asking or texting employees , to either stay back and work late for tasks such as cashing up or tidying up shop , or for work-related meetings for the purposes of customer and sales training .
Some complaints are also in reference to an expectation or request for staff to come into work early to set-up shop .
MAARTEN HOLL/STUFF First Retail 's Chris Wilkinson says the allegations against retailers are `` disappointing '' .
Spark spokeswoman Ellie Cross said in the past six months it had received two complaints on this topic , both which were laid since the Smith City ruling .
`` We take complaints like these very seriously , so undertook a full and thorough investigation . In both of these cases , we concluded that neither of the staffs in question had been underpaid , '' Cross said .
She said , after the Smith City case , all its staff had been briefed on Spark policies and that it had designed its working hour and pay arrangements to avoid anyone being in a situation of doing any prep work , handover work , or after-shift work without pay .
`` All Spark store staff are paid a salary rather than an hourly rate to avoid these kinds of issues . Fulltime hours for store staff are designed to cover our longest store opening hours , including a morning meeting before the store opens and any activities that are required after the store closes , '' Cross said .
First Retail 's Chris Wilkinson said the raft of complaints in recent weeks showed how widespread the problem of working without pay was .
`` The younger generation are more empowered . This is legacy behaviour and we 've seen previous generations rationalise working overtime . But this is no longer appropriate , '' Wilkinson said .
Earlier this month Briscoes , Whitcoulls , Harvey Norman , Rebel Sport , The Warehouse , Countdown , Cotton On , Noel Leeming , Farmers , Kmart , and Warehouse Stationery were the subject of complaints .
Labour Inspectorate national manager Stu Lumsden businesses would need to backpay staff if they failed to comply with the Minimum Wage Act .
`` This is simply about these businesses complying with their obligations – as the vast majority of New Zealand businesses do – and paying their staff at least the minimum wage for every hour worked . ''

One has to put it in the starkest terms : large numbers of people working in our fossil fuel-based energy sector are going to lose their jobs and it will happen in the near term . By DIRK DE VOS .
Last week , the National Union of Metalworkers SA ( Numsa ) teamed up with a shady and unknown entity , TransformSA , to launch an interdict preventing the signing of the outstanding Independent Power Producers ( IPPs ) power purchase agreements ( PPAs ) . The National Union of Mineworkers ( NUM ) chimed in that they opposed Eskom being the guaranteed off-taker of privately owned power generators that lock-in the profits of the qualifying IPPs .
Both unions , correctly , suspect that increasing amounts of renewable energy in the system will impact on the jobs of their members either in coal mining or in Eskom itself . The unions do not say that they are against renewables but rather that they are opposed to the creeping privatisation of the energy sector and that IPPs are some sort of Trojan Horse for just this .
Actually , it is far too late to talk about halting privatisation . Since 2006 , Eskom has taken on enormous amounts of debt , about half a trillion at present , and needs to take on a lot more . One could say that debtholders from the private sector are already calling the shots . The reconstitution of the Eskom board , the appointment of its new CEO , the firing of the corrupt former CEO , Matshela Koko , interim CEO , the acting CEO Sean Maritz and Gupta-linked former CFO were very significantly about satisfying the minimum requirements of these “ investors ” on governance and operational matters .
Going forward , Eskom has no choice but to embark on wide-scale job retrenchments if it is to have any chance of survival . Moreover , many generators and the collieries that service them will have to be closed in the next decade .
Prices for new solar PV generated electricity in other sunny countries such as Mexico are now just 24c/kWh , well below Eskom 's own existing generating costs and almost as low as just Eskom 's current coal costs measured on a per kWh basis . It is simply impossible to avoid the transition to renewables – purely on a cost basis .
The rather unusual nature of the South African electricity supply system is rooted in the history of Eskom being created to support the mining sector and then using its excess power to expand into the country 's cities , towns and even its rural areas and become a vertically integrated monopoly and one of the largest electricity utilities in the world . So far , nearly all independent power is provided via privately owned and operated IPPs . As such , IPPs have also come to be seen as threats to the public ownership of the electricity system and opposed on that basis .
The truth is that there is nothing inherent in renewables that means that they have to be privately owned and , likewise , large coal-fired power stations do n't have to be publicly owned . South Africa 's choices are a unique set of circumstances compared to the range of options used elsewhere .
However , it is worth exploring the debate about whether technology choices are in fact value neutral on a political economy basis . It is one of the more interesting philosophical questions right now . In the US , following a never-ending series of shootings , there are increasingly pressing calls to limit access to firearms . The response from the guns lobby comes down to this : “ Guns do n't kill people , people do. ” The argument is that a technology ( in that case , a firearm ) is value-neutral but the people that use them are not . There are the same arguments about smartphones and other technologies .
Philosophers such as David Morrow argue differently . He argues that technologies are necessarily value-neutral because they change the costs of certain options . The cost-benefit analysis changes and that has an impact on society as a whole .
Consider the land debate in South Africa and the difficulty of introducing new black farmers into the sector . Morrow looked at an example provided by the technology theorist , Langdon Winner : the effect of the introduction of tomato-harvesting machines .
Unsurprisingly , these machines mainly benefit larger farmers who could afford them and who were able to use them to harvest many more tomatoes than before . The increased supply of tomatoes in the market reduced the market price of tomatoes to all farmers but the increase in production by larger farms using the machine more than offset the reduction in tomato prices . There were , however , significant losses to small farmers who had to harvest more tomatoes , with their limited technology resources , to achieve the same income they had before .
According to Morrow , new technologies introduce two types of problems .
First , a collective action problem . This describes scenarios in which individuals can choose to co-operate with their fellow citizens or defect . It is an individual decision . At what point does the individual benefit provided by defecting to a new technology outweigh the individual benefits of co-operation ? An example of this might be high income individuals whose electricity consumption cross-subsidises poor customers defecting from the grid in favour of rooftop solar .
The second problem identified by Morrow is the delayed gratification problem or the choices between short-term and long-term rewards . Lowering the costs of instant gratification , as consumer focused technologies often do , makes it more difficult to prioritise long-term rewards . On a collective basis , social capital is eroded if society is not giving enough attention to the long term .
In a 2014 essay , Bloomberg Energy founder Michael Liebreich discussed the nature of the coming energy transition . In it he looks at what it might look like beyond the tired old debates between those wanting to keep the status quo as it is and proponents of climate change . He also goes beyond the more nuanced , second-level discussions about the benefits of clean energy , improved air quality , locally based jobs , technological breakthroughs , economic resilience , public health , geopolitical issues and global military spending , exposure to commodity prices and so on .
There is , Liebreich suggests , a third level that looks at the very social structures in which we live . Fossil-fuel based energy is not value-neutral , it lends itself to scale and centralisation ; both physical centralisation of huge oil , gas and coal-fields , massive power stations , universal grids , pipelines , refineries and the like , but also political and economic centralisation .
Liebreich sketches out a fossil fuel systems diagram in which one of the causal loops would see the fossil fuel industry gorging on subsidies and externalising substantial costs onto others , generating profits used substantially in lobbying , physical protection , community compensation and bribery .
These , in turn , secure political access and entrenched economic advantage . He sees these characteristics being as much a part of the old energy system as any pipeline or power station .
Against that , clean energy is inherently more local , more distributed , more accountable . Whether one finds wind farms a blight on the landscape or otherwise , they force us to talk about the trade-offs needed to generate electricity which few confront when discussing , say , the open-cast coal mines and polluting power stations in far-away Mpumalanga of the Waterberg and their impacts on the health of people who work and live there .
As transportation becomes electrified , cities will become more livable as we shift to electric vehicles , public transport , walking and cycling , shared ownership and other , cleaner options . As the energy system goes clean , Leibreich argues , so it will become more local , more accountable , more human in scale and more socially inclusive .
By socially inclusive , Liebreich means representative of other races ( than one 's own ) , sexual orientation and particularly women . At present , he says that the energy sector is probably the most socially conservative industry in the world . He correctly points out that women are disproportionately disadvantaged by energy poverty , bearing the extra workload and health impacts of cooking with traditional biomass .
Access to modern energy is essential for women to enjoy basic healthcare , particularly during childbirth , and for girls to have time to study . Also correctly , getting more women into the sector is not merely about fairness but about effectiveness . Women form a huge part of the market . A growing body of research shows that companies with diverse management teams outperform those that do not .
For the outlines of what a future energy system might look like , Liebreich points to other sectors that have thrown off centralised , state-dominated models and become less macho – such as telecoms , media and the airline industry . New clean technologies and distributed generation ought to introduce a democratisation of social as well as electrical power .
At the same time , the world is entering into what is now described as the fourth industrial revolution driven by emerging technologies in Artificial Intelligence , nanotechnology , robotics , 3D printing and other advancements which will have enormous impacts on the way industry manufactures almost anything .
Yet what do we see happening in South Africa ? In a recent survey measuring 114 countries ' readiness for the coming energy transition , South Africa comes in at 113 , beating only Zimbabwe . This is in a country that has a significant comparative advantage to other countries that are not as blessed with our climate . Falling renewable energy prices elsewhere certainly means that South Africa begins to lose the advantages it would otherwise have against countries that have chosen to embrace the energy transition .
For its part , Numsa appears to sort-of understand the basics of the energy transition and the need for a just transition to renewables . They take the view that renewables should be brought under public and community control , requiring a reinvention of regulatory bodies and the establishing of mechanisms for meaningful public involvement and democratic decision-making .
However , they also want to overthrow the “ … capitalist mode of production produces and reproduces human misery , disease , underdevelopment , joblessness , poverty and inequality all the time ” and oppose the capitalist capture of renewable energy in favour of a socially owned and democratic alternative .
The truth is that renewables as a technology and the energy transition do n't favour socialist centralised planning – it does the opposite . This means that the government and the energy sector workers ' unions can not spend any more time discussing their ideological preferences . That is pure self-indulgence .
One has to put it in the starkest terms : large numbers of people working in our fossil fuel-based energy sector are going to lose their jobs and it will happen in the near term .
The mismanagement and over-staffing of Eskom is the immediate cause but the march of renewables makes it inevitable in any event . Not stating this clearly enough is a dereliction of duty to those who will become unemployed and their dependents . DM

New guidelines released Wednesday recommend U.S. adults start colon cancer screening earlier , at age 45 instead of 50 .
The American Cancer Society 's advice puts it out of sync with guidelines from an influential government advisory group , which kept the age at 50 in an update two years ago .
Cancer society officials acknowledge the shift to 45 could cause confusion for doctors and patients but felt strongly that they needed to act now . The advocacy group was influenced by its study , published last year , that found rising rates of colon cancer and deaths in people younger than 50 . Experts are n't sure why there has been a 50 percent increase in cases since 1994 .
The guidelines are for men and women ages 45 to 75 of average risk for colon cancer ; recommendations are different for people with certain conditions , like Crohn 's disease , or a family history of colon cancer . The group endorses six kinds of screening exams , from inexpensive take-home stool tests performed every year to colonoscopies done every 10 .
`` All of these tests are good tests , and the choice should be offered to patients , '' said the cancer society 's Dr. Rich Wender . `` The best test is the test that gets done . ''
The same tests are recommended by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force , a panel that reviews evidence and issues advice for a variety of screenings and treatments . It updated its colon cancer guidelines in 2016 and its next review is n't expected until around 2021 .
That panel 's recommendations drive what screening is covered by insurance under the Affordable Care Act , although 20 states have laws that link coverage to the cancer society guidelines . It 's not uncommon for groups to have slightly different guidelines although those for colon cancer have been about the same for decades .
Most colon cancer occurs in adults 55 and older , and the good news is rates of cases and deaths have been falling for decades . Colon cancer , combined with rectal cancer , is the second leading cause of cancer death in the U.S . This year , more than 140,000 Americans are expected to be diagnosed with it , and about 50,000 will die from it .
Doctors will probably look to specialty medical societies to sort out the different guidelines , said Dr. Marcus Plescia , of the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials . But it may take a little while before they offer clear advice .
Some experts have worried about pre-50 risks of colon cancer in some racial and ethnic groups , and at least one specialty society for gastroenterologists has urged screening of black adults starting at age 45 .
Others argue that instead of lowering the age for routine screening , more effort should be put into getting more people tested . Only about two-thirds of people 50 and older have been following screening guidelines .
`` It 's hard enough to get people to do it at all , '' Plescia noted .
Dr. Andrew Wolf , the lead author of the latest guidelines , said they considered and rejected that reasoning .
`` We should be able to do both , '' said Wolf , a University of Virginia internist .
City to fix Cape canal plugged with debris
CAPE CORAL , Fla . Thick pockets of tape grass combined with trash and dead fish fill a canal near Hancock Bridge Parkway .
“ Something 's got to be going on with this water , ” nearby resident James Fagin said . “ I do n't know what it is , but something needs to be done because if this keeps up , there 'll be nothing but seagrass from one side of this canal to the other . ”
The canal may not be a pleasant sight , but this is a natural process and the issue will go away on its own , city officials said .
The tape grass grows naturally on the bottom of the canal and grows even more when canal levels are low , as they were during the recent drought , city officials said .
The grass breaks off and floats to the surface , eventually deteriorating .
John Thomas , who has lived on the canal for 30 years , says this is a regular occurrence .
“ This is nature , ” he said . “ This is part of Florida . ”
City officials opened the weir at Hancock Bridge to speed up the dissolution of the grass and expect the problem to resolve itself in a few days .
There 's a special kind of loneliness that comes along with big cities . Unlike rural , country towns , you 're surrounded by the bustle of millions of others wrapped up in their busy lives . It 's easy to fall into your own routine and ignore the outside world . Being alone in life surrounded by a crowd of others huddled together creates a dissonance unlike anywhere else . This is the backdrop for City Music , Kevin Morby 's fourth solo album and an ode to his former hometown of New York City . A loose concept album that follows a character trying to make his way alone in the city , it marks a clear progression for the former member of Woods and Babies to emerge as a noteworthy artist in his own right .
Morby envisioned City Music as a “ companion ” piece to last year 's gospel-tinged folk record , Singing Saw , but influenced by Lou Reed and Patti Smith as opposed to Bob Dylan and Joni Mitchell . City Music unfolds with a brisk energy , a distinct counterpoint to the soothing calm of last year 's breakthrough . It 's claustrophobic at times , filled with a bristling anxiety that erupts in key moments . On “ Tin Can ” , he sings about observing the city from afar as the music builds up momentum for two minutes before he gives a gentle coo as a cue for the song to explode into a raucous jam . He lets loose on “ Aboard My Train ” , where a winking homage to Dylan 's “ Forever Young ” flips into a roaring guitar solo , with a sense of playfulness and excitement that suits him well .
Morby is well aware of his history , and if anything , City Music is packed with too many references and winks that it can be distracting . It works on “ Flannery ” , an interlude where a friend of Morby 's reads aloud a passage from Flannery O'Connor 's novel The Violent Bear It Away , wherein a child entering a large city mistakes the city lights for the fire they were escaping . Morby works in references to Jay McInerney 's Bright Lights , Big City and makes album closer “ Downtown Lights ” a plea for comfort to the character Mother Sister from Spike Lee 's Do the Right Thing . He covers The Germ 's “ Caught in My Eye ” and strips the bite from it , making it a tedious ballad . On “ 1234 ” , he turns a punchy two-minute burst into an homage to Jim Carroll 's famous “ People Who Died ” where the names of the Ramones replace Carroll 's friends .
On their own , the references feel like an earnest effort to pay homage to greater works and attempt to work his own into a shared history . Combined , they feel overwhelming and a bit of a crutch , constant reminders that bring to mind anyone but Morby . Compared to a writer like Craig Finn or John Darnielle , who frequently call back to classic works and weave them into their songs to flesh them out and add context in service of the story , Morby 's use of them does n't always rise above winks to the listener . When he does it well , it shows , as on the wistful “ Night Time ” , built around his character moping by the stereo listening to Dylan 's “ Sad Eyed Lady of the Lowlands ” and painfully watching as the world passes him by . It 's a delicate balance Morby 's still working to achieve .
For any of his shortcomings as a storyteller , Morby 's guitar skills carry the lead on the album 's standouts . This is best expressed by the title track , a self-described “ Velvets jam ” built around a single riff for nearly seven minutes . The tempo drags at first , as his noodling pulls the track forward , but soon enough he and the band lock into a groove that snaps midway through . There are echoes of Tom Verlaine as he constructs this immersive jam around his riff and two brief stanzas of lyrics he repeats . By letting his guitar take the lead , Morby is able to capture the nervous , hectic sprawl of the city he admires more effectively than anywhere else on the record with the best song he 's written yet .
City Music marks Morby 's most ambitious album yet , as he expands his palette well beyond his previous work . In addition to the aforementioned sprawling jams , there are the haunting sounds of the nineteenth century organ that open “ Come to Me Now ” , the soulful blues and gospel backing choir of “ Dry Your Eyes ” , and the apocalyptic hum of “ Pearly Gates ” , wherein his character ponders judgment and damnation . His tribute to the allure of the city is a thoughtful homage to his musical idols built around a narrative that 's all too easy to relate to . When the record does stumble , it 's because he 's trying to juggle too many ideas at one time as opposed to a lack of effort . Mostly , City Music succeeds at displaying Morby 's strength as a rocker , and along with Singing Saw , the two together paint him as an artist truly coming into his own .

Traffic cops have issued vital driving advice to coincide with our campaign calling on the Government to improve road safety on the A19 .
The Safe A19 campaign was launched after the dual-carriageway saw two serious collisions in a space of a few days .
Our campaign is pressing the Department for Transport to launch an inquiry into the safety of the road .
It has been backed by Easington MP Grahame Morris and is also supported by Hartlepool MP Mike Hill .
Officers from the Cleveland and Durham Specialist Operations Unit urged drivers to show consideration and common sense .
Inspector Jon Curtis said : “ When joining traffic on a slip road , you should try to join at a speed that is similar to that of the traffic you are joining and only if there is a sufficient gap in the traffic flow for you to do so safely without impeding other drivers .
Many people still continue to drive at speeds that are inappropriate for the types of road they are on and for the weather conditions Inspector Jon Curtis , Cleveland and Durham Specialist Operations Unit
“ If you can not do this then you must stop and wait until there is a large enough gap to pull into the lane , once again without forcing other vehicles to slow down .
“ By the same token if you are in the left hand lane of a dual carriageway and you notice that a vehicle is approaching the junction to join your lane , check your mirrors and your blind spot and if it is safe to do so , move into the right hand lane . This allows the approaching vehicle to join the carriageway without slowing down .
“ You should spend most of the time in the left hand lane , with the right being reserved for overtaking or turning right where you are permitted to do so .
“ Do not hog an overtaking lane as this can cause frustration to those behind you who want to use the lane correctly .
“ The speed restrictions on dual carriageways will depend on their location and the amount of traffic they have to deal with .
“ Generally in non-urban areas the maximum speed limit is 70mph . This speed restriction may be lower in built-up areas , so take observe these variations .
“ Many people still continue to drive at speeds that are inappropriate for the types of road they are on and for the weather conditions . Always drive within the speed limits of the road you are travelling on and adjust them downwards when weather conditions deteriorate .
“ You should always take care not drive too closely to any vehicle in front of you .
“ As a minimum , you should try to allow two seconds between your vehicle and the vehicle in front .
“ This distance should be increased for speeds of 50mph or above , and at least doubled or more for poor weather conditions . ”

Today , I look back at my abruptly terminated first term as your Chief Minister in 1997-1999 , followed by over one year in various prisons across Pakistan , until I was ‘ forced ' against my will to board an aircraft into exile .
For a man driven at breakneck speed , in the service of his people for two years , these were for me a miserable ordeal as valuable time was wasted .
Two and a half years later in 2003 , I was diagnosed with a rare , aggressive cancer and had to be rushed from Saudi Arabia to the United States . It was a close-up encounter of the life with death .
But even as I was rolled into the operation theater , those present will verify , that I was only speaking of the nation building ; a vision that was ruthlessly disrupted .
As soon as the prognosis after surgery confirmed that the cancer had not spread to my lymph nodes , and a complete recovery was possible , I believed beyond doubt that Allah had only bestowed me with a new lease of life to serve His people unto my very last breath . Through a miracle of Almighty Allah , I was returned to serve Punjab in 2008 , from where I had left it ; but this time , I was a cancer survivor .
From the above account , it will be easier for you to understand that I could only be your Khadim-e-Ala .
A man in a hurry , to deliver , to get things done .
However , our effort has not been in vain . Wherever I have traveled recently in different parts of Pakistan , Karachi , Mardan or Mattiari , people have spoken with one voice : They desire the same quality of honest , efficient governance that is present in Punjab so that like their fellow citizens in the Punjab , their lives can also be changed for the better .
I have now completed two terms of government . Today , on the 31st of May , 2018 , I shall no longer be your Khadim-e-Ala . I say farewell with deep respect to the people of Punjab . Thank you for giving me the opportunity to serve you with intensity of my heart and bring about a difference in your life .
I seek forgiveness from all the people I could not reach and all those who could not reach me . I seek forgiveness from all those who feel I did not serve to their expectations , and from those who did not benefit from my governance .
All of you know there are some things I never compromised on , since these are sacred to my core values : selfless service to the people , especially care for the common man , selection on merit , zero tolerance for corruption or incompetence , and protecting and promoting the interests of Pakistan .
If , by the grace of Almighty , people honour me with their vote to serve them as their Prime Minister , I shall employ all my abilities and expend even the last ounce of my energy to serve all our provinces equally , so that the rest of the federating units not only stand at par with Punjab in terms of good governance and also raise our beloved motherland to the heights of glory as envisaged by our Founding Fathers , Allama Muhammad Iqbal and the Quaid-i-Azam .
As you all have known me since the 1990s , my life is an open book . I have been a fighter all my life : Fighting cancer , fighting corruption , fighting ‘ qabza ' mafias , fighting false allegations , and fighting for common man 's right to dignified life .
I am now ready for the biggest fight of my life on July 25 , the fight for Pakistan and all its people , to build a better and prosperous tomorrow so that our children can live in peace and prosperity and realise their God-given potential .
Your prayers will be my reward ! May Allah be with you , always !
The writer is the chief minister of Punjab and the President of the PML-N .

The teenager who fatally shot 17 people in a Florida high school giggled and proudly proclaimed he would become `` the next school shooter , '' according to cell phone videos he made of himself just before the attack .
“ My name is Nik , and I 'm going to be the next school shooter of 2018 , ” Nikolas Cruz said on the videos , released by prosecutors Wednesday . “ My goal is at least 20 people . ”
At least one of the videos appears to have been made on the same day as the Valentine 's Day assault on Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School . Cruz , 19 , says he wants to become a school shooter for the notoriety it would bring him .
“ When you see me on the news you 'll know who I am , ” Cruz says with a smile . “ You 're all going to die . Pew pew pew . Yeah , ca n't wait . ”
In one of the videos , Cruz outlined his plan for the massacre , saying that he intended to take Uber to the school and eventually end up on an upper floor of the building so that he could fire down on fleeing students like a sniper .
Cruz did take an Uber ride to the school that day , but for reasons that remain unclear , he aborted the last part of his plan and did not fire from an upper floor . After shooting 34 people , he fled with other people , mixing in with the crowd before getting a drink at a nearby restaurant .
Fred Guttenberg , whose daughter Jaime was one of the victims , said he read a transcript of the videos but chose not to watch them , the Orlando Sentinel reported .
“ I already know what he did , ” Guttenberg told the newspaper . “ He 's evil . Repulsive . He deserves to be dead . . . He talked about how he was going to be someone now . It 's a level of thought that I ca n't comprehend . It looks , from the words , like the kid had joy . I do n't want to see the delight he took in planning the murders of our children . ”
Andrew Pollack , whose daughter Meadow was among the dead , said Cruz can now rule out an insanity plea , the Sentinel reported .
“ It just shows this kid was competent . This whole thing was premeditated murder , ” he said . “ This kid knew exactly what he was doing . ”
Cruz suggested that he was planning the attacks in retaliation for being treated badly , although it is unclear by whom .
“ I 've had enough being told what to do and when to do . . . Telling me I 'm an idiot , '' he said . “ In real life , you 're all stupid and brainwashed . ”

MADRID ( Reuters ) - Smaller political parties hold the key to the survival of conservative Mariano Rajoy as Spain 's prime minister after centrist group Ciudadanos refused to support a motion of no-confidence in parliament due on Friday .
Opponents are taking advantage of Rajoy 's weak minority government and a court ruling last week that sentenced dozens of people linked to his People 's Party ( PP ) to decades in prison in a long-running corruption trial .
With little more than 12 hours to go before the fragmented parliament begins debate on the motion presented by the main opposition Socialists , the Basque region 's nationalist ruling party said it would meet on Thursday to decide how to vote .
The Basque Nationalist Party `` will announce its decision once it hears the Socialists ' motivations for presenting the motion and knows what ( Socialist leader ) Pedro Sanchez commits to do , '' it said on Twitter .
The bid to end Rajoy 's six-year rule would also need backing from parties that campaign for an independent state in Catalonia .
Rajoy said in parliament on Wednesday he intended to carry out his four-year term without calling an early election . But opposition parties are expected to continue to try to oust him even if the vote fails .
Ciudadanos ( Citizens ) , which has led some opinion polls in recent months , would be open to proposing a second motion of no-confidence with an independent candidate and an eye to calling an early election , its leader Albert Rivera said .
In an interview with COPE radio station , Rivera said the Socialists had turned down this plan .
'FRANKENSTEIN GOVERNMENT '
Sanchez has put himself forward as the alternative candidate for leader and offered to agree with other parties on a date for fresh elections .
Teneo Intelligence analyst Antonio Barroso said the chances were rising that Sanchez could succeed in toppling Rajoy , but the Socialists would be unlikely to make drastic changes to some of Spain 's most sensitive policy .
`` Even if the motion succeeds , it is unlikely that a ( Socialist ) minority government would fundamentally challenge European Union fiscal rules or negotiate controversial measures such as a self-determination referendum for Catalonia , '' Barroso said in a note .
So far , leftist party Podemos , which was founded in 2014 and fed off voter frustration with economic inequality and alleged corruption during a biting recession , has pledged its backing .
Podemos leader Pablo Iglesias , whose party holds 67 seats in parliament , would support the motion of no-confidence , he said in an interview with La Sexta television on Wednesday .
Even so , the joint votes with the Socialists fall short of the minimum 176 votes required to unseat Rajoy .
`` If it fails , as of Friday we will get to work on throwing out the PP , '' Iglesias added .
Rivera dismissed any partnership with Podemos and the regional parties , branding them `` separatists and populists '' .
`` A strong legitimate government arising from elections will give much more stability to Spain than a 'Frankenstein government ' with a parliamentary minority , '' he said .
Parliamentary debate is expected to start at 0700 GMT on Thursday , with a clearer picture of whether the motion will pass likely to emerge later in the day as the smaller parties speak .

The Porsche 917 is one of the most insane automotive creations ever dreamt up by humanity , offering a performance level that remains as impressive today as it was during the 1970s , when it dominated events like the 24 Hours of Le Mans . Some iterations were tuned to deliver as much as 1,580 horsepower , enabling them to rocket to 60 mph in well under 3.0 seconds and attain speeds of more than 240 mph .
You had to be pretty brazen to race one flat out , kind of like what the team at Icon Engineering must have been to take on the challenge of recreating the magic of the 917 in the form of this superb replica . It 's now in the final stages of development , after an extensive 5-year reverse engineering process based on British racing driver David Piper 's original 1969 917 , and if all goes to plan should be available for order in 2017 .
All of the design was handled using CAD , starting with the fiberglass body shell , then replicating the aluminum tubular structure , and then designing jigs to manufacture the structure and suspension components to a tolerance of 2.0 millimeters . The next stage was designing the cockpit , oil and fuel systems , and more detailed fiberglass components such as the internal air ducts . Should there be demand for it , Icon Engineering is even prepared to offer carbon fiber versions instead of fiberglass .

In the powertrain department , Icon Engineering recommends customers use a Porsche engine , though this is mostly for authenticity . The company states that the engine bay is big enough to fit the flat-12 engines used in some of the original 917 , so theoretically it could fit most engines . Icon Engineering is even looking into offering an electric version at some point , with the battery to sit in the expansive engine bay .
The aim of the project has always been to develop the replica to be at home on both the street and race track , so there have been some changes from the original 917 's specification to allow it to receive regulatory approval for street use . Of course , should the customer desire a track-only version , Icon Engineering says it can deliver a replica that 's true to the original spec .
Icon Engineering , based in the United Kingdom , plans to offer its replica as a rolling chassis , priced from £95,000 ( approximately $ 117,275 ) . That includes the laminated glass windows , magnesium wheels , suspension , brakes , dashboard and electrical harness .

For a turnkey car , the company will have to discuss the engine and transmission combination the customer desires . Icon Engineering points out that the price of original air-cooled Porsche engines have soared in recent years due to the strong demand for collector cars and their parts . However , the more modern—and more affordable—water-cooled engines can still be installed .
You 'd be lucky to find an original Porsche 917 for sale—and even if you did it would cost you tens of millions of dollars . Icon Engineering 's replica is an interesting , reasonably priced alternative , especially for anyone with a longing for nostalgia or perhaps jaded by modern supercars .
Anyone interested in learning more about the project should visit Icon Engineering 's website or hit up its Facebook page .
The Tufts Community Union ( TCU ) Senate held its final meeting of the semester in the Sophia Gordon Multipurpose Room last night .
TCU President Benya Kraus opened the meeting , announcing addresses from senate executives and a vote on bylaw changes .
TCU Vice President Anna Del Castillo then opened the floor for committee updates .
In one update , Grant Gebetsberger , a first-year senator , mentioned an upcoming meeting with the administrators to discuss a pilot program for Tufts ambassadors to visit underrepresented areas and speak about Tufts . Gebetsberger also mentioned the possibility of holding a town hall related to mental health .
Education Committee Chair Phil Miller announced that the Textbook Exchange will open on Dec. 14 , and will be open for a week .
Del Castillo then opened the election for the new chair of the Services Committee .
Senators then nominated candidates . Janey Litvin , Kevin Gleason , Izzy Ma and Rebeca Becdach accepted their nominations and became official candidates .
Each candidate spoke about why they would be an effective chair , followed by a question-and-answer session .
Senators then voted on the candidates . Litvin and Gleason tied , so they are now co-chairs .
TCU Treasurer Emily Sim then introduced a group of students representing Chabad serving Tufts , and gave them time to speak about their funding appeals request . The students discussed their Spa for the Soul event , which normally features a speaker , and their desire to bring Miriam Lipskier , co-founder of the Chabad Student Center at Emory University , who , according to the students , has come to Tufts twice and has been funded by TCU Senate both times . According to the students , Lipskier 's speeches have focused on femininity and Judaism .
Allocations Board ( ALBO ) members then spoke about why they denied the funding request , saying that the representative from Chabad who had originally presented the request was not familiar with what the speaker would be discussing . ALBO members said they initially felt uncomfortable funding a speaker without this information . There was then a question-and-answer period . Sim , a junior , then opened the floor for debate , and one of the Chabad representatives spoke about why this speaker is important . Sim then opened the vote on the appeals request . A new amount of $ 1,150 was proposed and the amount passed 25–1–0 .
The body approved funding requests from The Institute Sketch Comedy , TFL Comedy , Currents Magazine and Tom Thumb 's Student Garden .
Kraus introduced that the State of the TCU , State of Diversity & Community Affairs and State of the Treasury addresses .
Shannon Lee , the Diversity and Community Affairs Officer , gave the State of Diversity and Community Affairs address . Lee , a sophomore , noted that the university seems to be more divided than ever over diversity-related issues , and that although the university has made some progress , it could allocate more resources for students in need . Lee pointed out that underrepresented students do not have sufficient access to campus space or resources . The LGBT and Latino Centers need physical repair ; the Africana Center is in Capen House , which has no fire escape ; the Asian American Center is locked to most of its inhabitants due to the recent resolution and the International Center does not provide enough of a community space . Lee emphasized the need to increase support for students from underrepresented communities , and lamented that the burden often falls on these students to advocate for these changes . Lee said that the administration needs to do more to support these students . She added that more privileged students must also take initiative .
In her State of the Treasury address , Sim thanked students for their dedication to their organizations , and vowed to make the treasury more flexible and accessible . Sim said that more flexibility for signatories for the TCU credit card created easier access to it . Sim also noted that this opened up time for groups to have dialogue with her . Sim added that the cap for available funding from the Student Support Fund to cover club dues was increased by $ 50 . Sim also mentioned an ongoing collaboration with the School of the Museum of Fine Arts to discuss what support those students need .
In the State of the TCU address , Kraus highlighted that Senate serves as a place for dialogue , and that in light of recent divisive issues on campus , it is important to provide this safe space . Kraus praised the reform of Senate bylaws that allows more time for discussion of contentious issues . She added that the outreach committee has made significant progress , and that many initiatives to connect senators and students have been put in place , along with services such as the Turkey Shuttle . Key projects included the Swipe It Forwards campaign , bringing menstrual hygiene products to more bathrooms on campus and the town halls on the budget and spatial inequity . Kraus also highlighted sign changes underway for over 20 campus buildings to create more gender-neutral bathrooms , along with new bathrooms in the Mayer Campus Center and Dewick-MacPhie and Carmichael Dining Centers . Kraus expressed a desire to expand the discussion of spatial inequities , like the Asian American Center accessibility issues and the need for renovations in Capen House .
Historian Jacqueline Chen read the text of suggested bylaw changes , which proposed that it would be mandatory for community senators to sit on the Culture , Ethnicity and Community Affairs ( CECA ) committee , which is chaired by the Diversity & Community Affairs officer . The other change dictates that if another senator wanted to sit on CECA , the senator would have to sit on CECA in addition to his or her mandatory committee .
There was then a question-and-answer period about the changes .
Lee said CECA should be a space for community senators , and Asian American Community Senator and Outreach Committee Chair Charlie Zhen , a junior , emphasized the importance of keeping underrepresented communities in mind .
Lee explained that CECA was less effective this year because it was too large . She also said that diversity and inclusion work should not just be the work of CECA , and that other committees should also participate .
Kraus opened the vote on the bylaw changes . The changes were passed 29–1–0 .
Kraus gave Assistant Treasurer Sharif Hamidi , a first-year , an opportunity to explain his proposed resolution that calls on the administration to extend the deadline to designate a class pass-fail to 10 weeks into the semester for all students instead of just first-years .
The body then went into a closed session .

There 's no shortage of ways to check the temperature around the house , some more high tech than others , but the diminutive Eve Degree is aimed at a very specific audience : People with Apple HomeKit-based smart homes who want to monitor a room 's temperature and humidity .
There are many reasons why someone might need to monitor a temperature and humidity inside a room : Horticulturists raising exotic orchids , wine enthusiasts with cellars , cigar collectors with humidor rooms , and so on . These and other folks need to know precisely how warm or cool a room might be , and they need to know exactly how much moisture is in the air . Your thermostat—even a smart model—can only monitor the conditions immediately around it . If your HVAC includes a humidifier/de-humidifier , a portable sensor like the Eve Degree can help maintain comfort levels more efficiently if you can link it to your smart thermostat .
The Eve Degree app maintains a detailed history of all the data it collects . This means you can see how the location where you put the Eve maintains its environmental conditions . A small energy-efficient , black-and-white LCD lets you see its readings . Its powered by a removable , non-rechargeable button-cell battery , which seems odd in the era of built-in rechargeable batteries . Elgato says the Degree will run for one year on one battery , which is impressive .
Jason D'Aprile The Eve Degree is small , so you can put it nearly anywhere .
So , the Eve Degree is the sort of thing you either use as a single-purpose item—just to tell you the temperature and humidity in a single location—or as part of a more unified smart system . It works well in either capacity , but there are a few caveats to deal with . The most glaring issue for many users will be its exclusive compatibility with Apple HomeKit infrastructure .
Elgato 's Eve product line , from top to bottom , is compatible with HomeKit and nothing else . If you own a Wink Hub , a Samsung SmartThings hub , an Almond 3 , or any other smart-home system , Eve products are useful only as stand-alone devices So , Android and , well , any other type of smart hub user are out of luck for anything other than using it as a decidedly non-smart thermometer . If you are an Apple user , the Eve setup is simple . Using the Eve app , you just input a HomeKit code and the Degree connects .
Elgato The screen is easy to see in lighted areas , but no backlight means you ca n't see it in the dark
Better yet , the Eve app will automatically link to all your other related HomeKit devices , so your smart thermostat , for instance , will be visible and even controllable through the same app and linkable to the Degree . The app lets you create “ scenes ” for your HVAC , such as what you 'd like the system to do when you 're out or going to bed . Elgato deserves some special praise for making a UI that is more elegantly and intuitively designed than most of the actual thermostat-specific apps we 've tried , and having the ability to control multiple devices in one app is very convenient .
Elgato For those who like to track their indoor environment , the Eve app has you covered .
On its own , however , the Eve Degree is n't that versatile . It does n't offer temperature alarms or really anything but monitoring and storing temp and humidity data . It 's essentially a minor element for a greater system of tools . Another potential issue is its reliance on Bluetooth , as opposed to Wi-Fi . It will only update data in the app , for instance , when you open the app within range of the Degree .
The Eve Degree is designed for indoor use only it 's not at all weatherized against the elements . And since it does n't have a backlit display , it 's hard to see in the dark ( a backlight would surely drain the battery much faster ) .
Elgato 's Eve Degree is an exceptionally good way to monitor temperature and humidity in a small , unobtrusive package . If that 's all you need , however , there are cheaper alternatives . For Apple HomeKit users invested in advanced HVAC and smart home connectivity , the Eve Degree could be a very singular solution to monitoring specific home climates in a connected way .

Two and a half years ago , Loch Arbor resident Stacy Needle began crocheting soap sacks on the beach to donate to local homeless shelters . 7,000 sacks later , Needle 's creation has made its way not just across Monmouth County , but across the world .
The design is simple . Each soap sack is made of cotton yarn and is 4 by 6 six inches , the perfect size to hold a standard bar of soap . A paper tag with a short message is attached to each one , giving the donation a more personal feel . Thousands have followed suit and together have formed a movement Needle now calls S.A.C.K . – Supporting A Community with Kindness .

As the White House struggles to contain the fallout from the ouster of former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn this week , President Trump doubled down Wednesday on favorite lines of attack , against the mainstream press and the sources of their reporting . Trump , a voracious consumer of morning cable news , began the day by attacking “ the fake news media ” and their “ conspiracy theories and blind hatred . Morning shows on MSNBC and CNN were “ unwatchable , ” but “ Fox and Friends ” was “ great , ” he said .
In an apparent reference to a New York Times report that Trump campaign officials may have been in direct contact with Russian intelligence officials during the campaign - long denied by the White House - the president deemed questions about a “ Russian connection ” as “ non-sense . ''
Then he claimed information was being “ illegally given ” to the Times and Washington Post by the intelligence community that now serves him . “ The real scandal here is that classified information is illegally given out by ‘ intelligence ' like candy , ” he later added . “ Very un-American . ”

Feb 2 ( Reuters ) - Flu activity worsened over the past week as more people headed to doctors ' offices and emergency rooms , with hospitalizations at the highest in nearly 10 years , U.S. health officials said on Friday .
Sixteen children died of the flu in the week ended Jan. 27 , bringing total pediatric deaths to 53 for the season , according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 's weekly report .
Out of every 100,000 people in the general population , an estimated 51.4 have been hospitalized for the flu , surpassing the rate in the last severe season of 2014/2015 , when 710,000 were hospitalized and 148 children died . Adults aged 65 or older had the most hospitalizations , followed by those aged 50 to 64 , and children below 5 .
The dominant strain during this flu season is an especially nasty type called influenza A ( H3N2 ) that in seasons past had been linked with severe disease and death , especially in the elderly and young .
“ So far this year the cumulative rate of hospitalization is the highest since we began tracking in this way , ” Dr. Anne Schuchat , acting director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , told reporters on a conference call . The CDC began its current hospital flu surveillance program during the 2009-2010 H1N1 swine flu pandemic .
Schuchat was named acting CDC director earlier this week after Dr. Brenda Fitzgerald resigned from the post because of financial conflicts of interest , including purchases of tobacco and healthcare stocks while in office .
Flu is widespread in 48 states , down from 49 last week , with Oregon reporting less flu activity , the CDC said .
“ We are not out of the woods yet , ” Schuchat said , noting that sick people should stay home to avoid transmitting the virus to others , frequently wash hands and cover their mouth while coughing or sneezing .
The CDC official also said it was not too late to get a flu vaccine . ( Reporting by Deena Beasley ; Editing by Richard Chang )
New Delhi : Delhi and West Bengal were among a few states that did not participate in a national consultation organised by the Health Ministry to seek feedback on the draft guidelines to implement the ambitious Ayushman Bharat scheme , according to an official statement on Tuesday .
The Ayushman Bharat-National Health Protection Mission seeks to provide a cover of Rs 5 lakh per family per year to 10 crore poor and vulnerable families across India .
According to the statement , the ministry has prepared a detailed timeline to ensure the scheme is rolled out anytime after July .
The national consultation was attended by the CEOs of state health agencies , and state nodal officers . Most states attended the consultation , except for a few such as Delhi and West Bengal , according to the statement .
The secretary , Health Ministry , briefed the states on the contours of the mission and encouraged them to participate .
The states were divided into three sub-groups to ensure detailed discussions and seek in-depth inputs on the draft guidelines .
These included guidelines on beneficiary identification process , empanelment of hospitals , portability of benefits , model tender document and modalities of premium release .
Each sub-group presented the summary of the proposed changes they had suggested during the discussion .
Based on the feedback received from states , the ministry will release a model request for proposal and operational guidelines by the second week of May .
On 13 October 2014 , Mahoba district in Uttar Pradesh was declared a ‘ dark zone ' . The term conjures up images of gloom , despair , and perhaps even death . And in Mahoba , the situation is exactly as grim as it sounds . Dark zones are areas demarcated by the government where the over-exploitation of groundwater is acute , and where the withdrawal and usage of water exceeds its recharge . Dark zones have sprouted across the country , with Uttar Pradesh , Punjab , Gujarat , Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu attempting to grapple with the crisis . However , in Mahoba , the residents allege that the administration has taken no steps to tackle the issue of water shortage in the region .
According to a World Bank Report , around two-thirds of India 's aquifers will be in a critical condition in the next 20 years . Groundwater is a crucial resource for India ; over half the irrigated agricultural areas and 85 % of our potable water is dependent on groundwater .
In Mahoba , the incessant creation of bore wells and hand pumps has further reduced the groundwater levels in the region . According to the Water department , this year the groundwater table has receded by three metres .
Still , the administration remains careless and negligent . Water is wasted through mundane activities , such as cleaning various government centres . If the situation persists , it could precipitate a massive crisis for the people of Mahoba .
Manoj Kumar Shah , Assistant Engineer states , “ I would definitely call this area a dark zone . If water levels in the region are within a particular critical level , it is categorised as a dark zone . The category ‘ over-exploited ' is used if water usage is above the critical category—It involves excessively using an already critical or scarce resource . Whereas , a ‘ critical ' situation arises when the usage of water is exactly at the level available—when we effectively collect 100 litres and use exactly 100 without saving anything . ”
However , the residents of Mahoba have not been informed of these categories or terminologies . For them , their daily struggle to procure water overshadows other considerations . 60-year-old Urmila complains , “ It is so difficult for me to fill a bucket ( around 150 litres ) of water ... I get so tired ! One drum is needed for household chores , and one for the temple . In a day , this one bucket of water runs out so quickly . More than one drum is needed to do both household chores and for bathing . But if water is unavailable , what can I do ? ”
Yashoda , a concerned resident is despondent , when she tells us , “ There is definitely a problem , because water comes every alternate day . Some days , water is supplied everyday , but mostly it comes every alternate day . We are provided with one drum of water , when we actually require 4 . ”
Ramesh Chandra , the Engineer of the Irrigation Department sheds light on the issue , “ Yes , Mahoba has been declared a dark zone . This means that we ca n't use water for irrigation , but only for drinking purposes.We need drinking water for survival , so we 're permitted to use it. ” Groundwater sustains almost 60 per cent of the irrigated land in India . Most districts in India today have larger shares of irrigated land under groundwater irrigation than under surface-water irrigation . This ominous change in water use patterns in India has been extremely rapid since the 1970s . Reversing this trend , then , clearly seems to be the strategy of choice in Mahoba .
Ramnarayan , the clerk at the district Water Department is confident that the administration has this dire situation under control : “ Yes , the water has reduced this year , by approximately 10 ft . This definitely indicates a severe water problem . But the alternate support we have arranged for people have controlled the situation . Water is supplied almost every alternate day to people . ”
Ramesh Chandra is quite sanguine about what definitely sounds like a doomsday prophecy , ‘ For the last two years there has been a drought-like situation . There have been problems with water supply , and even the water level has further reduced . We have two MLAs , and under their aegis , we brought over 100 hand pumps to this area . We have surveyed the hand pumps and their condition . We came to the conclusion that a hand pump should be constructed at a distance of 75 meters from the other hand pump , and a population of 150 is required . The location list is with us and we shall install the hand pumps very soon . ”
However , skepticism about these plans is rife . Tara Patkar , an engaged and active citizen states , “ I have observed in these 10-12 years that one year it pours , and then for the next 2-3 it does n't rain , and we have much less water than we need . This causes uncontrolled tapping of the groundwater . In 2007 , the area saw a drought-like situation . At that time , the government installed many hand pumps . The problem was not the construction of these pumps , but the fact that they were installed near wells . This caused the destruction of the wells . People stopped using the wells , and because of the pumps , the regular channels through which water would travel to the well were disturbed. ” The rampant and negligent construction of hand pumps is one of the leading causes of the contamination and depletion of groundwater tables in India . Yet , the administration is conveniently patting itself on the back .
Sahdev , SDM Mahoba states , “ We have arranged for water for people with the help of 160 tankers . We have put the tankers in the right locations for easier access to water . More tankers are being arranged for people in higher areas where pipelines can not reach. ” Thus , in Mahoba , the administration seems more keen on quick-fixes than legitimate , systemic policy changes . Steps such as the construction of hand pumps may appease the populace temporarily and provide relief , yet will herald further ‘ darkening ' of Mahoba in the years to come .

A school team of 12- to 14-year-old basketball players from a tiny city of Caicara , Paraiba , in the north-east of Brazil secured a place in the Brazilian Youth School Championships in Curitiba following their win over Motiva College Team in the State Youth School Games . However , the celebrations were cut short as soon as they learned that the local government could not provide sufficient funds to allow the boys to travel to the games .
It would have taken three days to travel by bus from Paraiba to Curitiba in the State of Parana . So Caicara , a social project for public school students , offered their place to the private school Motiva College . Instead of taking them up on the offer , Motiva refused , and parents and students of Motiva College started a campaign to raise funds to allow the Caicara team to travel .
The campaign gained national and international support . Lucas Bebe from the Toronto Raptors in the NBA supported the appeal . In total 36,000 reals were raised ( just over $ 11,000 ) . Through the solidarity and generosity of the supporters , the Caicara boys travelled by plane , many taking their first ever flight , to Curitiba on 17 September , to play against the current runners-up in the championship . Caicara lost by 59 to 20 , but the support , excitement and the experience were worth far more than the result .
`` When we found out that we could not go , there was a kid who could not sleep , I had his mother calling me , '' coach Edynho Nash , nicknamed after his idol , former NBA superstar Steve Nash , said . `` Sport is not just a game . It is not just a question of competing for a medal , a trophy or a status . It can go much further with solidarity ! ''

OTTAWA — The House of Commons has unanimously adopted a motion blaming Russia for what it calls a despicable nerve gas attack in Britain .
Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia 's Freeland 's motion says Russia is showing a total disregard for the rules of the international order .
Former double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia were found unconscious on a bench in the city of Salisbury two weeks ago , the victims of what the British government says was a Russian nerve agent .
British and Russia has engaged in tit-for-tat expulsions of diplomats over the attack .
South Korea 's spy agency suspects two female North Korean agents assassinated the estranged half-brother of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un in Malaysia , lawmakers in Seoul said on Wednesday , as Malaysian medical authorities sought a cause of death .
U.S. government sources also told Reuters they believed that North Korean assassins killed Kim Jong Nam , who according to Malaysian police died on Monday on his way to hospital from Kuala Lumpur International Airport .
South Korean intelligence believed Kim Jong Nam was poisoned , lawmakers said after being briefed by the country 's spy agency .
They said the spy agency told them that the young , unpredictable North Korean leader had issued a `` standing order '' for his half-brother 's assassination , and that there had been a failed attempt in 2012 .
Kim had been at the airport 's low cost terminal to catch a flight to Macau on Monday , when someone grabbed or held Kim 's face from behind , after which he felt dizzy and sought help , Malaysian police official Fadzil Ahmat told Reuters .
According to South Korea 's spy agency , Kim Jong Nam had been living with his second wife in the Chinese territory of Macau , under Beijing 's protection , the lawmakers said . One of them said Kim Jong Nam also had a wife and son in Beijing .
Portly and gregarious , Kim Jong Nam had spoken out publicly against his family 's dynastic control of the isolated state .
`` If the murder of Kim Jong Nam was confirmed to be committed by the North Korean regime , that would clearly depict the brutality and inhumanity of the Kim Jong-un regime , '' South Korean Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn , the country 's acting president , told a security council meeting .
The meeting was called in response to Kim Jong Nam 's mysterious death , news of which first emerged late on Tuesday .
South Korea is acutely sensitive to any sign of potential instability in North Korea , and is still technically in a state of war with its impoverished and nuclear-armed neighbor .
TICKET TO MACAU
Malaysian police said the dead man , 46 , held a passport under the name Kim Chol . Kim Jong Nam was known to spend a significant amount of time outside North Korea , traveling in Macau and Hong Kong as well as mainland China , and has been caught in the past using forged travel documents .
Malaysian police said on Tuesday the cause of Kim 's death was not yet known , and that a post-mortem would be carried out .
Kim 's body was taken on Wednesday morning to a second hospital , where an autopsy was being performed . North Korean embassy officials had arrived at the hospital and were coordinating with local authorities , police sources said .
One of the South Korean lawmakers said Seoul 's spy agency expected the body would be returned to Kim 's family in Macau .
A Malaysian police source who had seen closed-circuit TV footage from the airport said a woman was involved in the attack .
`` So far from the CCTV we can confirm it 's a woman , '' the source said .
Asked during a news briefing if the murder of Kim Jong Nam was confirmed , South Korean Unification Ministry spokesman Jeong Joon-hee said : `` Yes , I have said it is confirmed . ''
South Korea 's TV Chosun , a cable-TV network , cited multiple South Korean government sources saying that Kim had been poisoned with a needle by two women believed to be North Korean operatives who fled in a taxi .
Reuters could not independently confirm those details .
Officials at the North Korean embassy in Kuala Lumpur would not speak to reporters gathered outside its gate and refused them entry . A few cars were seen leaving the embassy .
Michael Madden , a U.S.-based expert on the North Korean leadership , cast doubt on the notion that Kim Jong-un had personally ordered the killing of his half-brother .
Doing so would further feed the perception that Kim Jong-un is engaged in a `` reign of terror '' and is insecure about his leadership , and would also irritate China and Malaysia , countries with which it has relatively good relations , Madden said .
`` It does not serve Kim Jong-un 's political interests to have Jong Nam assassinated , '' he said . `` It is likely that if he was killed by North Korean operatives , then someone else pushed the button . ''
South Korea 's Unification Ministry urged North Korean defectors in South Korea and abroad to be mindful of their security .
Malaysia is one of a dwindling number of countries that has close relations with North Korea , whose nuclear tests and ballistic missile launches - the latest of which took place on Sunday - have provoked global sanctions .
Malaysians and North Koreans can visit each other 's country without visas .

Amid the criticism over rising cases of encounters in Uttar Pradesh , as many as 15 police shootouts were reported from 10 districts of the state in just 48 hours , said a media report .
According to The Times of India , 24 wanted criminals were arrested and one gangster was killed in these encounters .
`` The idea is to arrest these wanted gangsters and put them behind bars . The police have been directed to use force only in self-defence when there was no other option . The bottomline is that outlaws who are wanted in criminal cases have to be stopped , '' Director General of Police OP Singh was quoted as saying by The Times of India .
The most recent incident in the series of these encounters is the shootout between the state police and alleged dacoits on Saturday morning in Lucknow 's Krishna Nagar area where two persons were arrested , according to News18 .

A teenager learned his punishment Monday for killing a pregnant woman in Detroit .
The 16-year-old has been sentenced to 25-60 years in prison after pleading guilty to second-degree murder .
Prosecutors say Amanda Benton was beaten in September , driven to a vacant home in Detroit and set on fire .
She was five months pregnant , and her body found in the abandoned home .
The teen was originally charged with first-degree murder , along with Jacob Barnes , whose trial begins in May .
It 's the end of an era .
If you are a child of the '90s , you 're probably all too familiar with AOL Instant Messenger .
The once-popular program launched in 1997 and was commonly known as AIM .
Then texting , social media , and mobile apps took over .
The company announced Friday that it is discontinuing AIM effective Dec. 15 .
In a blog post , Michael Albers , VP of Communications Product at Oath , wrote one last away message :
“ If you were a 90 's kid , chances are there was a point in time when AOL Instant Messenger ( AIM ) was a huge part of your life . You likely remember the CD , your first screenname , your carefully curated away messages , and how you organized your buddy lists . Right now you might be reminiscing about how you had to compete for time on the home computer in order to chat with friends outside of school . You might also remember how characters throughout pop culture from “ You 've Got Mail ” to “ Sex and the City ” used AIM to help navigate their relationships . In the late 1990 's , the world had never seen anything like it . And it captivated all of us . “ AIM tapped into new digital technologies and ignited a cultural shift , but the way in which we communicate with each other has profoundly changed . As a result we 've made the decision that we will be discontinuing AIM effective December 15 , 2017 . We are more excited than ever to continue building the next generation of iconic brands and life-changing products for users around the world . ”

[ READ MORE : Gov . Ivey declares state of emergency ahead of Tropical Storm Nate ]
LATEST ON NATE : Tropical Storm Nate continues to strengthen as it moves north just east of the Yucatan Peninsula . The latest information from the National Hurricane Center ( N.H.C . ) shows Nate not too far from category 1 hurricane criteria . Currently Nate has maximum sustained winds of 65 mph and gusts as high as 70 mph . Nate continues to be a relatively quick moving system . It is moving north at 22 mph and will dive into the central Gulf this weekend . Preparations along the Gulf Coast should be underway .
WHAT 'S AHEAD : The latest track from the N.H.C . has Nate strengthening to a category 1 hurricane right before it makes landfall over southeast Mississippi early Sunday morning . What will be interesting to see is how Nate develops over the central gulf . One could argue Nate could reach hurricane status prior to this N.H.C . forecast thanks to an abundance of warm seas and little wind shear deterring growth . We 'll have to watch it closely .
WHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR ALABAMA : Outer bands could bring some scattered rain and storms to the state Saturday afternoon , but the chief time-frame of concern is from midnight Saturday night through noon Sunday .
It 's likely we 'll see hurricane force winds for extreme southwest Alabama , so that includes Mobile and surrounding areas . Much of the the WSFA viewing area which covers central and south Alabama have a high probability of dealing with tropical storm force winds .
Tornadoes will be a low but present threat for our area due to the center of circulation sliding just to our west . The east side of any tropical system has the greatest odds of producing tornadic situations . Rain amounts will depend on your location . We could see rainfall amounts between 1 to 6 inches . With the lower amount over east and southeast Alabama and the higher totals the farther west you go .
WHAT TO DO : Prepare for the possibility of power outages ; have candles , batteries , flashlights and any important medical supplies close at hand . Nonperishable food items and mechanical ( non-electric ) can openers could come in handy , too . Avoid driving Sunday morning if at all possible .
TIMING : Outer bands could bring some scattered rain and storms to the state Saturday afternoon , but the chief timeframe of concern is from midnight Saturday night through noon Sunday .
RAPID INTENSIFICATION ? The key question surrounding Nate is the intensity forecast . There are three scenarios . The most likely is that Nate gradually intensifies as it moves northward . But , there is also a small risk that Nate undergoes `` rapid intensification '' in the central Gulf of Mexico tomorrow . If that happens , the impact to our area will increase .
ALABAMA AND FLORIDA BEACHES : We anticipate storm surge flooding ( 4-8 ' ) , torrential rain , hurricane force wind and isolated tornadoes along the Alabama and Florida panhandle beaches . The weather will begin to go downhill quickly Saturday and will be very rough tomorrow afternoon through Sunday morning . Conditions at the beach will improve quickly Sunday afternoon , and the weather should be very nice along our Gulf Coast Monday and beyond .

A group of football fans are taking on a charity bike ride from Bristol to Sunderland in memory of little Bradley Lowery .
The team , made up of 11 Bristol City fans and three drivers , will cover a distance of 326 miles as they take on the ‘ Stadium2Stadium ' challenge .
Lee Rackham is taking on a charity bike ride to raise funds for the Bradley Lowery Foundation .
The unique challenge will see them begin at the Robins ' Ashton Gate home and stop off at various stadiums on their journey north to the Stadium of Light .
The fundraising initiative hopes to raise as much as possible for the Bradley Lowery Foundation , which is in the process of being set up after the six-year-old from Blackhall tragically lost his battle with childhood cancer neuroblastoma last month .
The charity looks to support children with cancer and other conditions whilst keeping Bradley 's legacy alive .
The idea for the charity cycle came from Lee Rackham , 31 , who wanted to show his support for the cause on behalf of the football community .
The bike ride is raising funds for the Bradley Lowery Foundation .
Lee , from Bristol , said his two sons Jensen Gordon , five , and Leo Rackham , six months , both suffer from conditions which may be able to receive support from the foundation once it is set up .
The former soldier-turned-scaffolder said : “ In the past I have done a bike ride from Scotland to Halifax for a six-year-old boy who had the same condition as Bradley had , and has now sadly died .
“ My son Jenson has a condition called hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia ( HED ) which means he does n't sweat and ca n't cool his body down , while my other son Leo has Pierre Robin sequence - a condition that affects his breathing .
“ They may both benefit from the foundation . ”
The bike ride will start out from Ashton Gate on Tuesday , October 24 and will see the group cycle to the Stadium of Light by Saturday , October 28 - when Sunderland play host to Bristol City .
Along the way , the team plan to cycle through Blackhall .
Lee added : “ We are hoping to raise £5,000 for the Bradley Lowery Foundation and so far we have raised £2,629 . ”

SEOUL - South Korea 's impeached President Park Geun-Hye on Sunday repeated denials of involvement in a snowballing corruption scandal and said rumours have been `` getting out of hand '' , Yonhap news agency reported . `` Rumours , stories and broadcasts have been distorted and false information has been getting out of hand , '' she was quoted as telling reporters at the presidential Blue House .
Parliament voted on December 9 to impeach Park over the scandal . She is accused of colluding with close friend Choi Soon-Sil to strong-arm big companies into handing over tens of millions of dollars to dubious foundations which Choi controlled . Choi is now on trial for coercion and abuse of power , largely related to the corporate funding of the two foundations which she allegedly plundered .
The impeachment case is being considered by the Constitutional Court -- which has up to six months to reach a ruling -- but hundreds of thousands of South Koreans have joined weekly protests calling for Park 's immediate departure from office .
If the impeachment is confirmed , a presidential election will have to be held within 60 days .
Park also allegedly ordered aides to leak state documents to Choi , who has no official title or security clearance , and allowed her to meddle in state affairs including the appointment of top officials . Since the scandal came to light , Park had apologised several times for her conduct in tearful televised addresses . She admitted seeking advice from Choi on some presidential speeches and PR material at the beginning of her term in 2013 .
Media reports have depicted Choi as having a `` Rasputin-like '' influence over Park , saying she controlled everything from the president 's wardrobe to crucial decisions on state affairs -- allegations denied by Park . `` I have known Choi for decades . But that does n't mean that she has access to everything , '' Yonhap quoted Park as saying , citing her `` duties as president . ''
Park 's rare meeting with reporters was her first public appearance since she was suspended from executive duties . The country has a temporary leader , Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-Ahn . The constitutional court 's first hearing on the impeachment is scheduled for Tuesday .

The amendment appears intended to avoid the administration 's legal case at the US Supreme Court becoming moot on grounds that parts of the executive order have expired .
Challengers to the ban , who say the order is intended to discriminate against Muslims , have said in court papers that it should expire on Wednesday , 90 days after the executive order was due to take effect on 16 March .
A memo issued by the White House , as the Supreme Court considered two challenges to the ban , said parts of the order put on hold would not expire before they can go into effect , and the start date would be when court injunctions were lifted .
The move is part of administration efforts to have the high court rule that the controversial ban should immediately go into effect after Trump 's first attempts to impose travel restrictions were blocked by lower courts .
Omar Jadwat , a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union , which has challenged the ban , said the need for the revision was a sign of the ban 's legal flaws .
`` And yet again , these revisions underline that the one thing the president has consistently wanted throughout is a Muslim ban , '' he added .
Lawsuits by Hawaii and Maryland challengers argued that the order violated federal immigration law and a section of the Constitution 's First Amendment , which prohibits the government favouring or disfavoring any particular religion . The Trump administration has said it is needed to protect national security .
Soon after the memo was issued , Acting Solicitor General Jeff Wall filed court papers saying that it resolved `` any doubt '' about the order 's effective date .
If the case was moot , the nine justices would have no reason to rule on it and lower court rulings against the administration would remain in place .
The Supreme Court on Tuesday gave the Trump administration more time to file papers responding to an appeals court ruling on Monday that upheld a block on the travel ban .
The court 's action likely delayed any decision on administration requests for the ban to go into effect until at least next week .
Federal judges in Maryland and Hawaii blocked Trump 's 90-day ban on travellers from Libya , Iran , Somalia , Sudan , Syria and Yemen . The Hawaii judge also blocked a 120-day ban on refugees entering the United States .
The 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals largely upheld the Hawaii injunction on Monday .
In the second case , the Richmond , Virginia-based 4th US Circuit Court of Appeals , on 25 May upheld the Maryland judge 's ruling .

From there , it was a quick side-step to his own show on CW Seed , which could further incorporate him into that world .
Check out the full synopsis and the poster below . Also , a note for fans who will be at NYCC this weekend : You can check out a special 3-min . sneak peek of Constantine on Sun. , 10/8 , at the beginning of Warner Bros. Television 's programming block in the Hammerstein Ballroom at 2:00pm EST .
This all-new animated series from Warner Bros . Animation and Blue Ribbon Content follows DC 's popular comic book character John Constantine ( voiced by the live action series star Matt Ryan ) , a seasoned demon hunter and master of the occult . Armed with an arcane knowledge of the dark arts and a wicked wit , he fights the good fight . With his soul already damned to hell , he 'll do whatever it takes to protect the innocent . With the balance of good and evil on the line‎ , Constantine uses his skills to face the supernatural terrors that threaten our world and send them back where they belong . After that , who knows… maybe there 's hope for him and his soul after all .
As the real-world deployment of driverless cars draws near , the race is on to make them even remotely affordable . The systems that currently drive robot cars cost upward of $ 100,000 per vehicle – not counting the cost of the car itself .
Until that price comes down , there will be no mass market for driverless cars .
As many as 50 start-ups are out to get costs way down , along with the research and development departments at automakers and auto industry suppliers , and Silicon Valley giants such as Google and Apple . Much of their focus is on the most expensive item in the computerized system that controls a robot car : laser-based sensors , or lidar .
The latest competitor is a stealth start-up that comes out of hiding today . San Francisco-based Ouster opened its website to begin selling a laser-based sensor system for self-driving cars to driverless vehicle makers and companies that supply them .
Today , the highest-end automotive lidar systems available cost $ 75,000 , made by a company named Velodyne . Ouster claims its new system , the OS1 , boasts near-top performance for less than a fifth of that cost , or $ 12,000 .
Angus Pacala is CEO of Ouster , a start-up in San Francisco . Neave Bozorgi
“ A Corvette is 90 % as fast as a Ferrari and it 's 10 % of the cost , ” said Angus Pacala , Ouster chief executive and co-founder .
Velodyne pioneered automotive lidar , which in turn enabled Waymo , the driverless car division of Google/Alphabet , to begin its driverless car project in 2009 . Waymo 's success has fueled radical transformation of the automobile industry as traditional automakers rush to keep current .
Lidar units shoot invisible beams of laser light off objects and measure how long they take to bounce back . Knitting millions of these signals together creates images called “ point clouds , ” which identify the material world around the car .
The technology can identify building and traffic signals and can discriminate people from animals , bicycles from motorcycles , rocks from soccer balls by shape and how fast and in which direction they 're moving .
Lidar is only one of several sensor systems that make up the robot system in a driverless car . Each has strengths and weaknesses . Video cameras and radar units are relatively cheap , but do n't see the world with the detail of a lidar system . Lidar has problems with rain , snow and fog , because the beams can bounce off snowflakes and water droplets .
Virtually all automakers believe all three sensor systems are critical to the safety and performance of driverless cars .
San Jose-based Velodyne is deep into its own cost-cutting drive , and recently built a second factory to meet heavy demand . Executives are quick to point out that its systems remain the most powerful on the market .
“ We 've been doing this for 10 years , we think we know a lot about what a car needs to see , ” said John Eggert , Velodyne director of automotive sales and marketing .
But existing systems “ remain very , very niche , ” said Arunprasad Nandakumar , market analyst at Frost & Sullivan . And expensive . The price of a lidar system needs to plummet to a few hundred dollars for any chance at mass deployment , he said .
He believes that will happen . He forecasts sales of 6 million lidar units in 2025 — half of them complex lidars needed for driverless cars , for a $ 2-billion market . ( The rest are simpler , single-beam lidars used to detect pedestrians and other obstructions . )
The reason for his optimism : Lidar systems are undergoing the same smaller , faster , cheaper evolution that has put the power of a 1990s supercomputer into a smartphone .
Similar to the way handheld digital cameras were shrunk to fit into an iPhone , today 's mechanical lidar systems and their many moving parts will increasingly become solid-state .
At least 50 lidar startups have been out raising money . Venture investors have sunk $ 678.4 million into lidar startups over the last four years , more than half of that going to 18 startups in 2017 alone , according to CB Insights .
Traditional auto suppliers such as Continental and Bosch are working on lidar systems . Some , such as Delphi ( recently renamed Aptiv ) and Magna , have struck partnerships with smaller lidar companies .
Major automakers are working on their own systems while hedging their bets with outside investments or acquisitions . Ford has sunk $ 150 million into Velodyne . General Motors recently bought Pasadena-based startup Strobe . Toyota is working with Luminar .
There wo n't be room for most of these systems , of course . “ Right now there are six or seven different ways on how to do lidar , ” said Oren Rosenzweig of Innoviz , an Israeli lidar startup working with Delphi and Magna . “ There are not seven different ways to make a DVD player. ” Ultimately , one or two approaches wlll prevail , he said .
Waymo and ride-hailing service Uber are also working on their own lidar systems . Uber currently is defending itself in federal court on Waymo 's charge that it stole lidar trade secrets .
The only driverless player that sees no need for lidar is Tesla , whose CEO , Elon Musk , believes his company 's software can make cameras , radars and ultrasound work together well enough to do without . As with just about everything at Tesla right now , proof of that concept is off in the future .
The children of Generation Z might look at pictures of today 's driverless cars and laugh at the ungainly gadgets that resemble spinning coffee cans or kitchen blenders rigged atop the car roof . The newer models often look like oversized hockey pucks .
As with digital cameras and other technology , lidar systems are expected to become smaller over time . Above , a laser-sensor system is tested in 2007 . Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency
The Velodyne technology is known as “ mechanical ” even though it 's packed with sophisticated electronics . With 64 laser channels , the cylindrical unit spins for a panoramic 360-degree look at the world .
Velodyne offers a much smaller unit fitted with 16 lasers . Fewer lasers mean lower performance on range , radius , refresh rates and so on . But it costs $ 8,000 , nearly a tenth the cost of the company 's most capable system .
Start-ups are exploring different methods . Innoviz uses stationary lasers that reflect off a tiny mirror that oscillates at absurdly high speeds on a single axis . Ouster is starting out with a “ hybrid ” system that spins like Velodyne 's but with far fewer semiconductors and other electronic parts inside .
“ We looked at over 50 companies in the lidar space , and found 14 of them to be reputable , ” said Chris Thomas , founder and partner at Fontinalis Partners , a Detroit-based venture capital firm and early Ouster investor . “ Are some of them going to make it ? Yeah . Are all of them ? No way . ”

KOTLI ( AJK ) : A youth committed suicide after failure to get married to the girl of his choice . Police said the youth consumed poisonous pills and died here on Sunday .
Police said that the youth , hailing from Khoi Ratta area of district Kotli , wanted to tie the knot with a relative girl , residing in his neighbourhood . However , parents of the youth as well as family of the girl rejected the proposal . The dead body was shifted to hospital where it was handed over to the heirs after post-mortem .
In recent years , the seriousness and number of official complaints related to the bail industry in California have significantly increased while bail agents and bounty hunters face limited oversight , putting vulnerable communities at risk of fraud , embezzlement and other forms of victimization .
This year , as Gov . Jerry Brown has pledged to work with lawmakers in a push to overhaul how courts assign defendants bail and to better regulate bail agencies , even some who profit from the court practice admit it 's time for regulation . These bail and bail-recovery agents could become unlikely allies , saying they advocate for change because they 've seen the system abuse the poor .
Los Angeles Times
Until now , the loudest critics of the efforts have been bail agents who have filled Capitol committee hearing rooms , blasted legislators on social media and poured more than $ 600,000 into lobbying efforts to prevent changes to how judges set bail and how their businesses are regulated . Civil rights and criminal justice groups have aggressively fought back against campaigns from the bail industry . One tactic : exposing agents who have faced criminal charges on a public website .
Jane Un , a Redlands bail agent who founded her own company in 2006 , believes bail companies have too much power .
There are a number of examples of practices for collecting the bail money that she calls abusive . Agents can use any citation to dock a client for breach of contract , such as arriving a few minutes late to a court appearance . She said clients have told her some agents hold people inside their offices until they or a relative can produce the money owed .
Un got involved in the business after having her own negative experience following a brush with the law . ( She was eventually cleared of real estate fraud and conspiracy to commit burglary , public records show . ) She has privately reached out to lawmakers about the bad practices she 's seen from bail agents motivated by greed .

Now she 's being more vocal and calling for a change to the system . There are multilayered problems . Un sees her clients struggling from the beginning . When someone is arrested , judges set bail according to county-established fees based on the gravity of the alleged crime . The fixed amounts vary widely and are too high for many families , she said .
Defendants must post the amount up front or pay a 10 % fee to a bond company before they are released . Those who ca n't afford either option may remain behind bars up to an additional 48 hours before they are formally charged and see a judge .
Un has helped petition courts for lower bail amounts on behalf of some defendants , according to court records and her clients — something she says many others in her business do n't do . “ Bail agents give [ clients ] the contract and do n't explain it , and people sign and initial without fully reading or understanding it , ” she said .
One of Un 's most recent clients , 28-year-old Araceli Cortes , said a different bail company took $ 5,250 in payment for her husband 's release , but lied to her and said he could n't actually leave because of an immigration hold . Cortes said she checked with the jail and found there was no hold and that the company had n't posted the bail . The agents refused to return her money .

Another element of the business under scrutiny : recovery agents and bounty hunters . Many are paid on commission and do n't need to be licensed , meaning they can have insufficient knowledge of search and seizure or other laws of arrest .
Marc Bender is a recovery agent with Aladdin Bail Bonds , one of the largest companies of its kind in the state based on its number of employees . He said many bounty hunters do n't get paid if they do n't bring a person in , meaning “ there is a lot of incentive to cut corners . ”
Un said she once overheard two bounty hunters that she hired bragging about taking an already stolen Louis Vuitton purse from the client . “ I am hearing all of this , and I 'm thinking , ‘ My god , the bounty hunters I hired are committing a crime and they are getting away with it , ' ” she said .
She said the most she could do was not hire them again .
Norma Alcala , a West Sacramento school board member who owned her own bail company in the late 1990s , remembers more-severe cases . In the male-dominated industry , she said , agents often did not return their clients ' collateral , things like luxury cars and expensive jewelry , and some were known for demanding “ couch bail , ” getting someone out in exchange for sexual favors .
She left the business because she saw the rich buying themselves out of trouble while poor people were “ the ones who really suffer . ”

Stories like these have prompted lawmakers to take a hard look at an industry of roughly 3,200 registered agents in California who collectively write about 175,000 bail bonds per year .
Assemblyman Rob Bonta ( D-Oakland ) and state Sen. Bob Hertzberg ( D-Van Nuys ) are working to overhaul the bail system .
One proposal would eliminate fixed bail fees and require counties to establish their own agencies to evaluate defendants for release . Another measure would compel bail companies to post the terms of their contracts online and direct the California Department of Insurance — which regulates the bail bond industry — to conduct a review of the surety corporations that back them .
State Insurance Commissioner Dave Jones supports the changes . Citing increases in complaints , he said in a February report that the state should also license bounty hunters , require more data disclosures from bail companies and create special units to investigate bail violations and enforce compliance .
Department of Insurance data show that complaints against agents and companies more than tripled between 2010 and 2012 , from 62 to 225 cases . In 2017 , the number of complaints was 131 , accounting for 10 % of all violation allegations sent to the department 's enforcement agency , even though bail makes up less than 2 % of the insurance market .
The figures could be even worse . State bail agent associations have told their members to stop filing complaints against other agents and companies while legislative debate is pending , according to a spokeswoman for the Insurance Department . One investigation out of Santa Clara County resulted in the arrests of more than 30 bail agents . They were charged in a scheme to scoop away business from competitors by paying inmates to recruit other inmates for them as clients .
With limited state resources , only a few of the reported cases resulted in enforcement , such as agents having their licenses revoked or facing criminal charges . Legislation to increase funding for investigations and prosecutions was shelved in 2015 and 2016 amid heavy bail industry lobbying .

The state also releases little public information about complaints . Thus , the Bail Reform Coalition , a group of civil rights and criminal justice organizations , on Monday detailed cases against agents and bounty hunters across the state .
The research project is compiled from news stories , court records and regulatory proceedings . It lists agents including Fausto Atilano Jr. , who , along with employees , has been charged in Riverside County with pointing guns at residents and , in one case , using a taser weapon against the daughter of a Wildomar mayor . Another offender on the group 's website is former reality television star Arturo Alfred Torres , an agent with bond companies in Los Angeles and Orange counties . He pleaded guilty to felony grand theft in 2016 after investigators said he refused to return $ 18,000 to the mother of a client whose charges were dropped .
The group cites vocal bail legislation opponents like Teresa Lynn Golt and Lisa Louise Golt . The sisters and founders of Lipstick Bail Bonds have testified at Capitol hearings and passed out chapsticks with their logo , clad in matching pink jackets .
In one 2013 case , the Golt sisters were sued by a man alleging he was injured when they tried to detain him , pepper spraying him and shooting him with a stun gun and rubber bullets . The sisters countered the claims were false , and a judge dismissed the lawsuit . In 2000 , they were charged with issuing bail without a license and illegally accessing private information from law enforcement computers . They were sentenced to probation after they pleaded no contest to lesser charges .
Calls and emails to Atilano and the Golt sisters were not returned .
Un , Bender and others in the industry are in favor of increasing standards , improving court evaluations of defendants and lowering bail fees . When it comes to the bigger picture , they remain staunch defenders of bail , saying it is needed to hold people accountable .
Bender contended that counties need trained recovery agents like himself to bring people back to court . Some clients cycle in and out of jail , bailing out with different companies , and he believes court agencies wo n't have the resources to help them .
He said his job is n't like what appears on reality television . He tries talking to his clients about turning their lives around .
“ Every once in awhile , I do reach someone , ” Bender said . “ That is what it 's about for me . Those few people I could reach . ”

The Rock Island County Sheriff has launched an investigation into what caused a large tree branch to collapse at Red , White and Boom in Rock Island Tuesday killing two people .
The branch was 8 ' 2 '' in width at its base , and 45 feet long , according to Sheriff Gerald Bustos .
`` The oak tree that we are talking about , I believe to be about 100 years old , '' Bustos said . `` It has been on the courthouse lawn for every picture I can find going back in history . ''
The ongoing investigation will include an arborist to look for any potential cause of the collapse . The sheriff , and locally trained arborist , Mickey Covert , say the tree appears healthy .
`` This is a healthy tree , '' Covert said . `` Many trees have dead on it and on the tips . ''
Covert told KWQC that based on his training , he believes that water and moisture got gathered in the area where the branch met the tree .
`` What we have here is what we call the branch collar , '' Covert said demonstrating his belief on a tree across from the Rock Island County Courthouse ... `` The weight of the lead affected all the moisture and stuff that was gathering right here . It started with water and moisture gathering . ''
Covert said they water and moisture can create rot , which allows for a hole to develop allowing animals or bugs to get into the tree .
`` You could n't tell from the outside how big the hole was with normal maintenance who much it was rotten in the inside , '' Covert said . `` I do n't think this could have been prevented . ''
The tree is cared for by the Sheriff 's Office , according to Sheriff Bustos .
`` Because of this tragic incident , we are going to be looking at all of the tress there and do whatever we can to keep that area safe , '' the sheriff said .
Bustos says that an arborist will be apart of the investigation , but he does not believe the tree is salvageable .
In the early days of the ban of meldonium , a supplement/heart medication popular among Russian athletes that led to the second positive test for Yulia Efimova and a first positive test for Grigory Tarasevich , among many others , very few suspensions were given out .
That came as a result of athletes successfully arguing that they were n't given enough warning that the substance would be outlawed , and claiming ( in what seems to be an accepted statement ) that at the time , there was n't enough viable research on how long the substance would remain in a person 's system after it was outlawed . The ban was announced about 6 weeks prior to it taking effect on January 1 , 2016 .
Early tests in that period were met with a no-fault finding , and were given little-to-no punishment . The exception is Russian tennis superstar Maria Sharapova , who unlike most that tested positive for it admitted to having taken it after the ban ( though she said that she was n't aware that it had been outlawed ) .
While no official announcement was made by WADA , it seems as though Meldonium has officially become a substance that athletes can become banned for . The best indication of this is a 4-year suspension handed to Zambian distance runner Jordan Chipangama earlier this month by the United States Anti-Doping Association , which is more transparent in publishing its testing history and findings than almost any organization on earth .
The result of two samples collected in June and August of 2017 , respectively , were the first to receive the maximum 4-year suspension from USADA . The last case adjudicated by the organization for meldonium was Ivan Tutukin , a triathlete who tested positive as late as May 23rd , 2016 , and he was given a no-fault violation . At the time , he said that he stopped using the medication in October of 2015 , 7 months before his test , after more than a decade of using it .

LONG BRANCH – Family , friends , staff , and current students of Trinity Hall filled the seats of Monmouth University 's Pollak Theater on Sunday , June 4 , to celebrate the all-girls high school 's historic first commencement .
The idea to establish an all-girls high school in Monmouth County began in 2010 . By 2012 , a board of trustees was created and the school had a name . In September of 2013 , the founders of Trinity Hall saw their hard work come to fruition with the all-girls school 's official opening for their first freshman class .
In the fall , the school moved from its temporary location at Croydon Hall to its permanent campus in Tinton Falls , in a building on the former Fort Monmouth Army base .
Last weekend , the 32 young women who took a leap of faith in 2013 were bestowed diplomas as Trinity 's first ever graduates as the Class of 2017 .
Several students said they could not have been happier with their experience at Trinity Hall . The challenges they faced as the first class in a new school were not disadvantageous , but instead empowering for them . “ It was scary , I 'm not going to lie , ” said graduate Lilly McCann of making the leap into the unknown of a new school . “ I felt like I was kind of in ‘ eighth grade , part two ' my freshman year . ”
Holly Koerwer , the inaugural valedictorian , agreed that being the first class of Trinity students was an interesting experience , one which she compared to being “ basically seniors for four years. ” However , Koerwer believed this was a blessing in disguise , allowing her classmates to forge a new path and make their own traditions .
New traditions seemed to be a theme throughout the day , especially in Koerwer 's valedictory address . She talked about the many responsibilities she and her fellow graduates had as Trinity 's first class . “ Out of all the responsibilities we gladly took on , I believe the task of establishing tradition here at Trinity Hall is the one we held closest to our hearts , ” she said . Koerwer went on to list some of those traditions , like team chants and prayer , and especially the freshman bonding trip where they jumped “ into turtle-infested waters , ” according to Koerwer .
Koerwer , who is continuing her education at the U.S . Naval Academy this fall , attributes her success to Trinity Hall . “ Trinity helped me so much , ” she said . “ I discovered my love for engineering and technology here. ” Koerwer says Trinity pushed her to take on challenges and gave her a new confidence in herself she believes she would have never known at another school .
The founding chair of Trinity 's Board of Trustees , Sean Clifford , delivered the commencement address . Clifford , a founder of the school and father of three girls , two of whom are current students at Trinity , spoke to the graduates from about their school 's motto—leadership , respect , perseverance , and faith—and what those values represent . “ No matter who you are , from where you came , or where you are going , you must persevere , ” he said . Clifford is himself a product of single-sex education , having graduated from Christian Brothers Academy ( CBA ) in Lincroft . He holds a B.A . from Loyola , an M.B.A. from Fordham and is a chartered financial analyst in the investment industry .
Prior to the creation of Trinity , CBA was the only single-sex high school in Monmouth County , serving the boys of the greater Jersey Shore area . Trinity 's founding leadership team , like head of school , Mary Sciarrillo , and assistant head of school , James Palmieri , felt the lack of a corresponding all-girls school was a disadvantage for young women in the area .
Sciarrillo , a Monmouth County native and mother of three , sought to fill this educational void when she agreed to be Trinity 's founding head of school . Before joining Trinity Hall , Sciarrillo worked at Oak Knoll School of the Holy Child in Summit , New Jersey as their Upper School principal . Sciarrillo saw Trinity as an exciting opportunity to depart from traditional methods of teaching . “ Our instruction is more innovative than traditional high schools can be , ” she said .
Some of the teaching methods Trinity employs are small class sizes , an individualized learning environment and increased use of technology in the classroom . Graduate from Brianne Dwyer said the small class size is one of her favorite aspects of Trinity . “ I felt the teachers were able to be more one-on-one with us and I was able to get the support that I needed , ” Dwyer said .
The assistant head of school , James Palmieri , joined Trinity four years ago after Sciarrillo had signed on as the head . He was originally added to Trinity as a consultant after working as an administrator at the Kent Place all-girls school in Summit for eight years . Palmieri shared Sciarrillo 's sentiment about the need for same-sex education for girls . He believes it is important for any geographical area to have quality educational options , and that “ this area , in general , lacked significant options for high school , especially for girls . ”
Inside the Pollak Theater on Sunday evening , a standing ovation broke out after the last of the seniors received her diploma , officially signifying the completion of Trinity Hall 's first-ever commencement . There were tears of celebration among the school supporters .
Trinity 's student body is growing , due to efforts by Trinity 's administration , staff , and advancement team , like Theresa Kiernan , the director of advancement and admissions . In its larger location , the school is now able to accommodate over 70 girls who have registered for the 2017-18 school year .
Kiernan said she was filled with admiration for the bravery and spirit of the class of 2017 . “ It is history , ” she said . “ We are seeing these girls make history . ”

Milan : Gianluigi Buffon on Tuesday blasted talk of a row with Juventus teammate Medhi Benatia as `` invented gossip '' to try and unnerve the champions in the title race .
Buffon , 40 , was reported to have let rip at centre-back Benatia after Kalidou Koulibaly scored in the final minute in Turin as Napoli beat Juventus 1-0 on Sunday , cutting Juve 's lead to just one point at the top of Serie A with four games to play .
It was also a foul by the Moroccan defender which resulted in the controversial late penalty which gave Real Madrid a place in the Champions League semi-finals at the expense of the Italians .
`` It 's the kind of gossip , patently invented , that comes after the defeat of teams like Juventus who do n't have an Achilles heel , '' Buffon told Juventus TV .
`` They try to destabilise the environment and undermine the certainty and the union of the group , '' he continued .
`` No-one , at least in my 17 years at Juventus , is allowed to point the finger at someone and blame an error for a defeat .
`` What 's more , as long as I 'm captain of this team that will never happen .
`` I 'd like to add that Medhi is an extremely respectful lad and that he 's tied to our cause with an education and way of being in an exceptional group .
`` I 'm sorry to be forced to point it out , but I have to because in the face of news which is , if not defamatory at least false , I think a clarification is needed to protect the group and Medhi , who is a splendid lad . ''
Goalkeeping legend Buffon insisted his side were united as they push for a seventh consecutive Serie A title and a fourth straight Italian Cup .
`` We 've dropped five very important points in recent days , but we 're still first with a very small advantage , '' said the Italian .
`` There are 20 days to go , in which we 'll have to return to the pitch with ferocity and sporting brutality and to be united .
`` The match with Inter ( on Saturday ) is a decisive one , but the ones with Bologna , Roma , and Verona will be too and then there 's the Italian Cup final .
`` If not we 'll play into the hands of our opponents and those who , in our few moments of difficulty , have always tried to create problems with ill-founded news , without ever succeeding . ''
The New York Giants are closing in on trading a former first-round -- no , not that one .
NFL Network Insider Ian Rapoport reported the Giants have had trade discussions centered around offensive tackle Ereck Flowers , per sources informed of the situation . The belief is the new brass will trade him for draft compensation , per Rapoport .
Flowers has stayed away from team workouts as the Giants prepare to open their voluntary veteran minicamp Tuesday .
The Giants signed left tackle Nate Solder in free agency to handle the left tackle duties , presumably shifting Flowers to the right side , if he ended up remaining in New York -- which seems unlikely at this stage .
The No . 9 overall selection in 2015 , Flowers struggled mightily in three seasons as a 46-game starter . For most of his career , Flowers has been an automated turnstile on Eli Manning 's blindside seemingly ushering pass rushers to the quarterback .
The Miami product , however , remains just 23 years old and still owns the athleticism that made a top-10 pick . A fresh start could be beneficial for both sides .
Given the dearth of offensive tackles on the open market and a shallow draft class at the position , it 's possible Big Blue could get a late-round compensation return for Flowers during the draft .
DETROIT ( AP ) — Michigan health officials say the southeast part of the state is seeing a serious outbreak of hepatitis A cases .
An analysis by the Detroit Free Press found that Michigan has led the U.S. in hepatitis cases per capita this year , with more than 500 reported cases so far .
The Detroit News reports that there have been 20 deaths linked with hepatitis A in southeast Michigan since August 2016 .
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says hepatitis A is an extremely contagious liver disease caused by the hepatitis A virus . It can be spread during sex or by eating contaminated food or water .
Health officials say the majority of cases involve drug users , homeless people and current or former inmates . The outbreak has particularly affected Wayne , Macomb and Oakland counties .

RALEIGH , N.C. > > The deadline has passed for college players to declare early for the NBA draft . Now its time to wait for the draft entries who didnt hire an agent to decide whether theyre staying in or heading back to school .
The early-entry deadline was Sunday night . The next date to watch is May 30  10 days after the conclusion of the NBA draft combine  as the last day for draft entrants who didnt hire an agent to withdraw and return to school to keep their remaining eligibility .
Players testing the waters can work out for NBA teams to learn what they need to improve or whether they could be a first-round pick on June 21 .
Heres a look at some key names , none of whom are surefire first-rounders , facing decisions that could have a big impact on next season :

ACC BACKCOURTS
Boston College and Clemson have a lot riding on what happens next .
High-scoring guard Jerome Robinson ( second in the Atlantic Coast Conference at 20.7 points per game ) and point guard Ky Bowman ( 17.6 ) helped the Eagles take a big step with 19 wins  three more than the previous two seasons combined . If they return , Boston College could have nearly its entire team back as it chases the programs first NCAA bid since 2009 .
The Tigers await decisions from leading scorer Marcquise Reed ( 15.8 points ) and starting guard Shelton Mitchell ( 12.2 points ) after the duo helped Clemson reach the NCAA Sweet 16 for the first time since 1997 .
TYUS BATTLE , SYRACUSE
The 6-foot-6 guard is a possible first-round pick who racked up the minutes  a national-high 39 per game  while increasing his scoring average from 7.4 as a freshman to a team-best 19.2 last season . Battle helped the Orange make an unexpected run to the NCAA Tournaments Sweet 16 , but Syracuse sure could use him next year after top recruit Darius Bazley decided to skip school and head to the G-League .
BRIAN BOWEN , SOUTH CAROLINA
Bowen has yet to play in college after getting tangled in the federal corruption investigation into college basketball .
The 6-7 forward originally landed at Louisville before being suspended after news of an alleged payment involving the Cardinals and his father to get him to join that school . Bowen has denied knowledge and since transferred to South Carolina , where he practiced and participated in pregame warmups but has yet to be cleared by the NCAA .
The move at least gives the McDonalds All-American another option if the college route appears unlikely to work .
DONTE DIVINCENZO , VILLANOVA
The Final Fours most outstanding player certainly ended the season in unforgettable style with 31 points in the title win against Michigan that gave Villanova a second national title in three seasons . He averaged 13.4 points and 4.8 rebounds to offer plenty of scoring punch off the bench .
Villanova will take a big hit with the departures of Associated Press national player of the year Jalen Brunson and Mikal Bridges to the NBA , but Phil Booth and Eric Paschall are returning for their senior seasons . And if DiVincenzo and Omari Spellman ( another agent-free draft declaration ) join them , Villanova will bring back four double-digit scorers to chase coach Jay Wrights third title .
CARSEN EDWARDS , PURDUE
The 6-1 junior was a third-team AP All-American and the Jerry West Award winner as the nations top shooting guard after leading the veteran Boilermakers in scoring ( 18.5 ) while shooting nearly 41 percent from 3-point range .
If Edwards stays in the draft , the Boilermakers will lose their top five scorers from a 30-win team  leaving Matt Haarms as the top returnee with a 4.8-point average .
CALEB AND CODY MARTIN , NEVADA
The 6-7 twin juniors had a big impact after transferring from North Carolina State . Caleb Martin averaged 18.9 points and shot 45 percent , while Cody averaged 14 points and shot roughly 52 percent in helping the Wolf Pack reach the NCAA Sweet 16 for the first time since 2004 .
The Martins and junior Jordan Caroline ( 17.7 points ) all announced in social media posts on April 3 that they were testing the NBA draft waters . Their return could set Nevada up for another memorable March .
CHARLES MATTHEWS , MICHIGAN
The 6-6 guard started every game for the Wolverines , averaging 13 points and 5.5 rebounds to help Michigan reach the NCAA championship game . With Moe Wagner leaving a year early for the NBA , the former Kentucky transfer is set for the starring role as the Wolverines chase a third straight Big Ten championship .
LUKE MAYE , NORTH CAROLINA
The 6-8 junior went from role player to inside-out leading man , averaging 16.9 points and 10.1 rebounds to become a third-team AP All-American . Mayes return would give the Tar Heels three returning starters to go with the programs best recruiting class in years .
ADMIRAL SCHOFIELD , TENNESSEE
The 6-5 , 238-pound forward averaged 13.9 points and 6.4 rebounds . If he returns , Tennessee would lose only two reserves from a 26-win team that won a share of the Southeastern Conference regular-season title .
London : Former Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal believes the club have become more boring under his successor Jose Mourinho , saying he would prefer to watch local rivals and Premier League leaders Manchester City in action .
During the Dutchman 's two-year stint as United manager from 2014 , the club secured fourth and fifth-placed league finishes along with an FA Cup triumph , but Van Gaal was regularly criticised for his negative tactics .
Mourinho 's United won the League Cup and Europa League in his first season in charge but the Portuguese has been accused of `` parking the bus '' in big games , and Van Gaal believes the former Chelsea boss deserves more criticism .
`` I would rather watch City play than United , “ Van Gaal was quoted as saying by the Mirror . '' You need quality in a squad and it 's clear City have a better squad .
`` ... And yet , right now , looking at United , I have to conclude Mourinho is not being criticised while it 's far more boring football . ''
`` What United produce now is defensive football . I always played attacking football ... They do n't do that now because Jose Mourinho plays so defensive . ''
City are on a record 14-game winning streak in the league while United , who finished sixth last season , lost 2-1 to their neighbours on Sunday to slip 11 points adrift of them in second position .
Van Gaal , who was sacked the day after his FA Cup triumph , clarified that he had no personal issues with Mourinho but hit out at United CEO Ed Woodward , saying that the 46-year-old did not openly communicate with him .
`` I have more problems with the CEO , Ed Woodward . He never discussed anything with me — and you can talk about anything with me , '' Van Gaal added .
`` With all my experience , I know the unwritten laws of football . A club has to prepare for the future . I can understand that and they should have approached me . Ed could talk to me but he did not . ''
New Delhi : Cross-country skier Jagdish Singh 's participation in the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics was on Saturday jeopardised as he could not board the flight for the South Korean city due to ambiguity over his accompanying coach .
Jagdish was to leave for Korea this evening along with celebrated luger Shiva Keshavan but both Winter Games Federation of India ( WGFI ) and his employer , Indian Army , wanted coaches nominated by them to travel with him .
Jagdish trains at the High Altitude Warfare School ( HAWS ) at Gulmarg and is scheduled to compete in the 15-km Nordic skiing freestyle event .
The WGFI proposed names of President Col . ( Rtd . ) Jodh Singh Dhillon and Secretary General Roshan Lal Thakur but they were rejected by the Indian Olympic Association ( IOA ) since it is a de-recognised body .
The HAWS recommended Major General Atul Kaushik — its commandant — to accompany Jagdish but the IOA wanted to check his credentials whether he was actually Jagdish 's coach . IOA Secretary General Rajeev Mehta said that all the paperwork , ticket and kits for Jagdish were ready but he did not turn up to board the flight .
He also said that the HAWS has not replied to IOA 's mail to furnish details of its nominee regarding his association with Jagdish as coach . Mehta said Jagdish 's travel schedule can be reworked and his ticket can be re-booked but before 8 February . He has written a letter to the HAWS to immediately confirm the travel schedule of Jagdish .
`` We bring to your attention that the Indian Olympic Association has not received the travel confirmation of Mr Jagdish Singh . It is a matter of serious concern that despite our repeated mails you are not confirming the travel schedule of the athlete .
`` As informed earlier that on 8 February there is Team Welcome Ceremony at the Games Village and participating athlete should attend this ceremony and it is a national prestige at International Sports Arena , '' Mehta wrote in the letter addressed to the OIC Army Winter Games Node at the HAWS .
`` Since the Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports has de-recognized Winter Games Federation of India , neither WGFI nor HAWS kept us informed about the selection , training and coaches participating in National/International Winter Sports . It is once again requested that kindly take a serious note of this issue and confirm the travel programme of the athlete at the earliest . ''
Mehta also said that `` justification with regard to the official imparting coaching ( to Jagdish ) may kindly be intimated to the Indian Olympic Association '' . When contacted , Jagdish told PTI : `` I need a coach to accompany me . The coach is a must as he will have to do waxing ( of his ski ) and other things .
But what can I say , the name of the coach sent from here ( HAWS ) has not been accepted . I do n't know what will happen . ''
Meanwhile , Keshavan on Saturday left for South Korea to participate in his sixth Winter Olympics . He was felicitated by Mehta at the IOA headquarters on Friday .
`` We wish Shiva all the best and hope that his achievements will inspire future generations of Winter Sports Athletes , '' Mehta said . Keshvan successfully defended his Asian title this year by winning gold at the Asian Championship held in Altenberg , Germany in December .
The Winter Olympic Games kick off on 9 February with the Opening Ceremony , followed by the four heats of the Luge Men 's Singles events on 10 and 11 February . The final result will come out with the total time earned from the four runs .
A team at St. Paul 's Hospital in Vancouver has discovered a new test to diagnose a rare disease , known only as IGG-4RD .
Rheumatologist Dr. Mollie Carruthers , an expert in treating it , says most patients initially receive the wrong treatment .
She says it 's often confused with cancer because it forms masses in the body .

“ IGG4 Related Disease is a hard disease to explain to people . That 's because it 's an immune mediated disease that can go basically anywhere in the body . ”

“ In order to make a diagnosis it can be quite challenging , because not everyone is going to present something like chest pain , like in a heart attack . So you have to have good lab tests in order to help lead you towards a diagnosis . ”
The condition is treatable , which is why Carruthers says an accurate diagnosis is so important .
She says thanks to the team at St. Paul 's , patients can receive the correct treatment right from the start .
Sunscreen , hats , sunglasses , shoes , batteries , headphones , waterbottles — here 's everything you need to stay healthy for your summer fitness and fun !
Summer is coming . For many of us , the ice has cracked , the snow has fled , and the parks are once again open for some serious fun . But with great weather comes great responsibility . The sun burns , the bugs bite , the heat parches , and the kilometers blister . None of those are deal-breakers , though , provided you prepare .
Whether you 're amping up your Apple Watch workouts , playing Pokémon Go , or simply enjoying the world around you , here 's what you need to beat the summer heat .
The best sunscreen
Like Superman , we 're powered by the rays of our strong yellow sun . But what makes us stronger can also burn us . That 's why really good sun screen is an absolute must for anyone spending any time outside this summer .
According to The Sweethome 's Shannon Palus , this is what you need :
[ If ] you 're outside , you should be applying a full shot glass 's worth of sunscreen to your near-naked body about once an hour in order to get adequate protection with your sunscreen . That 's a lot . Which means the best sunscreen needs to be affordable .
For that reason , she recommends NO-AD Sport SPF 50 or Coppertone Oil Free Sunscreen Lotion SPF 30 .
You need your skin for life , so take care of it .
A great hat
It could be for your favorite sports team . It could be for your best-loved geek franchise . It could be from the latest fashion line or simply surplus . Whatever the branding — or lack thereof — the important thing is that it keeps the sun off your head and provides shade for your eyes .
Depending on where you live and how you style , a ball cap , a cowboy hat , even a pith helmet is fine . Kangol and fez , no matter how bowtie-cool you may find it , do n't have the brims you need to keep the sun from making you squint .
Amazon has a huge selection of hats . So does ThinkGeek . Find one you love and wear it when you go out .
Jamming headphones
I 'm of two minds about headphones . Sometimes I ca n't stand hiking with headphones because all I want to hear is the rain , the river , the birds , and the wind . Other times the honking and hollering of city streets practically forces me into listening to podcasts or music . Either way , a great set of headphones are either a must-have or a must-have ready .
Recently I 've gone wireless . Being constrained by battery life has definite drawbacks but my ears have been worn down enough by grappling that wired headphones simply do n't stay in . ( What a different the lack of pull makes . )
I prefer AirPods to BeatsX , because when I go wireless I want to go wireless . But Apple still has n't managed to keep them in stock , so buy what 's available . I also really like PowerBeats as well , because the loop can keep them on any ear through just about anything .
If you need something not bound by battery , Wirecutter recommends the Sennheiser OCX 686G Sports if the EarPods or earbuds that come with your phone simply wo n't do .
Super sunglasses
Sunglasses are n't just about looking cool . OK , they 're a lot about looking cool , but they 're also about protecting your eyes . Anything and everything from particulates to UV light can get into and damage your eyes while you 're out and about , especially if you 're out an about at velocity on a bike , board , boat or skates .
If you 're just strolling around town or picnicking in the park , any old dime-store or boutique lenses could do . If you 're working out , be it prepping for a marathon or hunting down Pokémon or portals , you need more serious shades .
Bob Howells , writing for The Wirecutter :
What differentiates sport shades from the ones you wear for driving or around town ? The degree of protectiveness is the short answer . Chances are , your around-town sunglasses ( like eyeglasses , if you wear them ) are almost flat . They do n't hug your face . They permit a fair amount of stray wind and light to reach your eyes . They may have glass lenses , which can shatter in an impact situation ( a stray pebble that kicks up , or a header while you 're mountain biking ) . Glass lenses have awesome clarity and are highly scratch-resistant , but they 're not practical for really active pursuits .
He likes the Ryders Sevent and the Julbo Aero .
For a less sporty , more budget pick , his colleagues like the ZeroUV Longhorn .
Sensational shoes
Pounding the pavement is as brutal on your feet as it sounds . Cement and asphalt are hard and , the latter especially , can get HOT . If you 're on the trails , there are rocks , thorns , and trash to worry about as well . So , if you want your feet to last , and with a minimum of blisters and strain , get good shoes .
For most activities , I love Nike Free . Your feet were designed to move , so the less that comes between them and movement , the better . ( I get the lowest number I can find and take the soles out so my Nike are extra free . )
They 're the next best thing to being barefoot in a world strewn with enough sharp objects to demand adequate protection .
Portable battery pack
No drain , no gain ! It 's goofy but it 's true : Many outdoor activities demand a lot of power . If your Apple Watch is in workout mode , the heart rate monitor is firing . If your iPhone is being used to battle in Pokémon Gyms or navigate through a national park , the screen is lit and the GPS is hard at work .
Anything that keeps the screen and the radios on will hit the battery hard . So , if you know you 'll be out for a good long while and you 'll be using your gear on the go , play it safe and bring a power pack with you . That way , if you suddenly find your batteries running low , you do n't have to cut your day short . You can simply plug in and keep playing — or at least get enough of a charge to reach a plug before it 's too late .
If you have a backpack with you , I like the mophie powerstation XX because it can charge multiple devices multiple times . If you 're sticking strictly to pockets or fanny packs , the TravelCard is great . If you have an iPhone but want it to be more like an iPhone Plus when you 're out and about , Apple 's Smart Battery Case has efficiency that simply ca n't be beat .
Water , water , water
It 's critically important to stay hydrated when you 're out , especially in the heat . That means drinking water regularly . You can find a fountain or Apple Pay for a bottle whenever you need it , but by the time you 're thirsty you 're already late .
If you have a backpack or even a decent-sized pocket or pack , keep some water with you and sip regularly . Otherwise , make sure you stop regularly to refresh . Set a timer if you have to . Do the environment a solid and use a Klean Kanteen or whatever water bottle you like best . Plenty of places give them away as marketing swag , so you should be able to find one cheap if not free .
Then keep it with you , keep it filled , and keep on drinking .
Take breaks , keep cool
No matter how well prepare you are , the heat can sometimes be too much . If there are warnings about UV levels or air quality , if it 's too hot or too humid , or if you 've simply had enough — stop . There 's no prize for sunstroke , sunburn , or dehydration , other than dizziness , discomfort , and disruption .
So , take breaks when you need them and , if it gets bad outside , duck inside . If you really need to fill your rings or kill your step count , walk laps in a nice , air-conditioned mall for a while or wait until dusk and things cool down .
Play the long game and workout smarter , not harder .

Four months after a Falcon 9 rocket exploded on a Florida launch pad , SpaceX has determined that the cause was a failed composite overwrapped pressure vessel used to store liquid helium .
In the final update to its investigation released Monday , the Hawthorne space company said one of three such tanks in the rocket 's larger , second-stage liquid oxygen tank failed , probably after a buildup of liquid oxygen between the vessel 's aluminum inner liner and its carbon overwrap ignited .
In November , SpaceX Chief Executive Elon Musk described the cause of the explosion as something that has “ never been encountered before in the history of rocketry . ”
The company said its accident investigation team — made up of officials from SpaceX , NASA , the National Transportation Safety Board , the U.S. Air Force , the Federal Aviation Administration and industry experts — found “ buckles , ” or valleys , in the vessels ' inner liners .
Super-chilled liquid oxygen can gather in buckles , and when pressurized , the oxygen can get trapped . Then , “ breaking fibers or friction can ignite the oxygen in the overwrap , ” causing the vessel to fail , SpaceX said .
The company also said the loading temperature of the helium was cold enough to create solid oxygen , “ which exacerbates the possibility of oxygen becoming trapped as well as the likelihood of friction ignition . ”
To fix this issue in the short term , SpaceX said it will change the configuration of the composite overwrapped pressure vessels “ to allow warmer temperature helium to be loaded. ” It will also change helium loading operations to a “ prior flight proven configuration ” that is based on procedures that were used in hundreds of successful loads .
SpaceX plans to eventually change the design of the vessels to prevent buckles , which the company said will allow for faster loading operations .
The company is now targeting Jan. 8 for its return to flight , pending FAA approval . SpaceX plans to launch 10 satellites for Iridium Communications Inc. from Vandenberg Air Force Base .

Three Turkish soldiers were killed and six others were injured in clashes with PKK/YPG terrorists in Syria 's northwestern Afrin region and a separate attack on a Turkish border outpost on Saturday .
The terrorists attacked an outpost in southern Kilis province with anti-tank missiles on Saturday , killing one soldier and injuring five others , with two in critical condition .
The cross border attack from Syria 's Afrin region targeted the border outpost of Saatli village , which is located some 20 kilometers northwest of Kilis city center .
The watchtower of the outpost was hit by a missile , increasing the number of injured soldiers .
A statement by the Turkish Armed Forces later in the day said that one soldier was killed in the attack . It added that another soldier was killed in clashes in Afrin .
A separate statement said that a tank was hit in Afrin , killing six soldiers .
Since the beginning of Operation Olive Branch on Jan. 20 to clear PKK/PYD/KCK/YPG and Daesh terrorists from Afrin region , eight Turkish soldiers were killed , in addition to approximately 20 losses of Free Syrian Army ( FSA ) fighters .
As of Saturday morning , 897 PKK/YPG terrorists were killed in operations , airstrikes and shelling by the Turkish military .
TOKYO ( Reuters ) - Japan 's government will likely present to parliament its nominees of next central bank governor and deputy governors around mid- to late February at the earliest , sources familiar with the matter say .
There is a strong chance Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda will be reappointed when his five-year term ends in April , given premier Shinzo Abe 's recent comments praising him for boosting growth , government and parliament sources say .
But this is by no means not a certainty , the sources say . While many in the market are betting on Kuroda 's reappointment , some see the chance of other candidates such as Etsuro Honda , Abe 's former aide who has expressed interest in the post , landing the job .
Koichi Hamada , a Yale University academic and Abe 's economic adviser , praised Kuroda but said there were other well-qualified individuals who could take up the reins .
“ The standard strategy is to continue with Governor Kuroda , or any person who pursues ‘ Abenomics ' like him , ” he told Reuters .
Kuroda and his two deputy governors - career central banker Hiroshi Nakaso and former academic Kikuo Iwata - will see their terms end on April 8 and March 19 , respectively .
Nominees for such high-profile positions need approval by both houses of parliament to become effective . The government usually submits its nominees for various posts in two rounds .
The BOJ nominees are likely to be in the second round and wo n't be submitted to parliament until the first round gets approved , which may take until mid-February , the sources say .
That means the government 's nominees for BOJ governor and deputy governors wo n't be presented to parliament until later this month or even early March , they say .
“ It might not come until late February , ” said a ruling party lawmaker familiar with the process , a view echoed by two other sources who spoke on condition of anonymity .
The timing will depend much on how smoothly the government can push through parliament the state budget for next fiscal year and find time to take the nominees ' list for vote .
It is a near certainty the government 's nominations will get the majority needed to pass parliament , as Abe 's ruling coalition has enough seats in both houses of Diet .
ONE DEPUTY POST FOR A CENTRAL BANKER ?
The choice of the new BOJ leadership will be crucial as it would set the path of monetary policy and affect how quickly the central bank could follow in the footsteps of its U.S. and European peers in dialing back crisis-era stimulus steps .
While Kuroda has dismissed the chance of an early exit from easy policy , analysts see his reappointment as heightening the chance for a slow but steady shift toward monetary normalisation .
The choice of candidates with more radical views like Honda , an advocate of big fiscal spending financed by faster central bank money printing , may jolt markets as investors may see it as a break away from the current policy framework , analysts say .
The government will likely fill one of the two deputy posts with a career central banker with deep expertise on markets and technicalities of monetary policy , the sources say .
A reappointment of Nakaso or an appointment of BOJ Executive Director Masayoshi Amamiya , who masterminded many of the bank 's monetary policy steps , are seen as possibilities , they say .
A Reuters poll last year showed many analysts expect Kuroda to serve another five-year term as governor , though some saw the top job going to Honda , Nakaso or Amamiya .
The people can take to the streets if Prime Minister Najib Abdul Razak dares to call for an emergency and halt the upcoming 14th general elections , Pakatan Harapan chairperson Dr Mahathir Mohamad said today .
Mahathir , however , said that Malaysians are generally timider compared to citizens in countries like Brazil and South Korea , where massive protests pressured their top leaders to resign over corruption allegations .
“ But in Malaysia even when we do Bersih , not many go out ( to join ) … If you take no risk , you get no gain . So we must be brave .
“ If there was an emergency declaration called by Najib , we can go out every day to demand for an end to the emergency and for a return of democracy , ” he said .
Mahathir was speaking at a youth forum today at the Perdana Leadership Foundation .
He was asked what Harapan 's preparations were should Najib use the excuse of heightened racial-religious tension to halt the election or suspend its outcome .
“ That 's all I can say . People must support the politicians if they want the politicians to succeed .
“ We will do our best but we need support from the people , ” said Mahathir .
However , he said that Najib would not dare to cling on to power via emergency rule should Harapan receive more popular votes in GE14 .
Mahathir also noted that Najib would not be able to declare a state of emergency without the consent of the Yang di-Pertuan Agong .
“ Without the Agong 's consent , there could not be a state of emergency .
“ He ( Najib ) must also get support of the inspector-general of police and chief of the armed forces , ” said Mahathir , who cited the rise of people power in the Philippines only after its police and military withheld support for then president Ferdinand Marcos .
‘ People should vote '
At a press conference later , Mahathir reiterated his stand against the calls for voters unhappy with both Harapan and Barisan Nasional to spoil their ballots .
“ Yes , these are democratic ways , including not voting . If that 's the case then we should boycott everything . We have that process , ” he said when asked for comments on arguments that vote spoiling is also a legitimate part of the democratic process .
“ As citizens , we must have the sense of responsibility for our future . People should vote , make up their mind , and do n't complain .
“ If you do n't vote , you lose your right to question whatever government that comes , ” said Mahathir in response to a question regarding demands for Harapan leaders to apologise over personal attacks directed towards proponents of the # UndiRosak ( vote-spoiling ) campaign .

There were no earth-shattering announcements in the recent national Budget related to the security concerns of the country . On the contrary , this year 's allocation , though an increase of 7.8 percent , year on year , is one of the lowest in terms of percentage of the GDP . Economists peg it to 1.58 percent of the GDP , which is the lowest ever since the bygone era of Sino-Indian conflict of 1962 . The negative impact of this is cumulative and will be long-lasting , as this is in face of existing critical deficiencies and shortcomings .
There is no doubt that inclusive growth should be a priority , but India 's unique security dynamics demand a realistic allocation of funds , action and just not lip service . The star projects of the three services are already languishing in the corridors of the ministries of defence , finance , and law and justice . The reasons are a combination of changing political and financial priorities , inadequate appreciation of the requirements , bureaucratic hurdles and our own designed tedious procedures cum processes .
In my opinion , we are the only country that , in the name of propriety , frames regulations which are exhaustively tardy to the point of being infructuous and then take their recourse to reject our own critical acquisitions . The delay is further exacerbated due to the short tenure of senior military leadership on critical appointments dealing with procurements . What needs to be appreciated is that delay year on year , leads to ‘ less for more financial outlay ' , denying us the ‘ desired bang for the buck ' . This results in irreversible negative ramifications on the operational preparedness of the armed forces .
The budget was path-breaking in its idealism to address the concerns of the agrarian community and measures for giving impetus to the ‘ Swasth Bharat ' mission . They are both timely and laudatory , but the overall tenor of the budget was with an eye on next year 's Lok Sabha elections . The salaried class was left gasping , for instead of any major windfalls , their savings in the equity/bond market are now taxable for long term capital gains . These and other nuances of the budget will come up for discussion and scrutiny in the next few days but what really raises conflicting emotions are the short shifting of issues relevant to the men in olives , white and blue , in the budget .
The financial apathy in the allocation of requisite wherewithal for national security concerns under the jurisdiction of the armed forces was seen across sectors . Be it equipping , modernisation , border infrastructure , qualitative upgrades in equipment , development of asymmetric capabilities and corresponding disinterest in the systematic erosion of the intangibles of soldiering , like status and remunerations .
This coupled with recent events where the military is made the scapegoat or used for political one-upmanship raises a very fundamental question :
Are the armed forces trophies to be displayed on events like Republic Day or glorified to raise the national fervour in case of ‘ surgical strikes ' , or is there a genuine concern for making them razor sharp/empower them to meet the disruptive external and internal security challenges ?
A few recent events contribute to this quandary . In the immediate past was the political gamesmanship we witnessed in Kashmir , where , to placate the misplaced sentiments of the chief minister , an FIR was lodged against the aggrieved party : The army personnel . They were the victims , as they were attacked by a mob that resorted to carnage , resulting in the dastardly act of burning of military vehicles and threatening the personal security of the soldiers .
In self-protection , they had to resort to firing with collateral damage . There were no political spokespersons exemplifying the concerns of the soldiers involved in the incident , including the defence minister . In another incident , the army was asked to make a bridge in the financial capital of the country , when India has some of the best infrastructure construction companies in the world . In contrast , the northern borders of the country are still bereft of critical road and bridge connectivity . This affects the maintenance of security in these inhospitable areas . The shortcomings are not appreciated due to lack of expertise at the appropriate levels of decision-making . The silence is deafening when there is unwarranted mud-slinging and un-parliamentary remarks against the COAS by responsible member of the political hierarchy .
It is the failing of the military man that he is trained to complete his task against all odds and expects the others in the executing chain to address their responsibilities in an equally capable or timely manner . There is lack of accountability of the defence developmental and manufacturing agencies , who have repeatedly failed to meet the timelines , abrogated financial prudence and provisioned sub-standard and obsolete military hardware . The bureaucratic protection that they enjoy makes it all the more onerous for the finance and defence minister to ensure provisioning of the right tools in a timely manner to the soldiers .
In conclusion , it would be apt to highlight that the armed forces are one of the foundation pillars of the Indian democracy . Let not envy-cum-resentment by the other organs lead to erosion of its core strengths . Also , honing the kinetic elements of the nation is an essential prerequisite for the country to realise its vision of becoming a major player in the evolving international landscape .

We have more details on a fire that destroyed an Emmet County home .
Fire crews were called out a little after three Monday afternoon on Hughston Road in Harbor Springs .
The Harbor Springs fire chief says no one was hurt and the owner was at work when it happened .
He adds that if this had been a different season , it may have ended up much differently .
“ Had it been spring , you know , when there 's no snow or anything on the ground , this could 've easily turned into a different situation , as far as a wildfire , a grass fire going through the woods with dry conditions . We are fortunate enough that there 's enough snow on the ground so things are still wet enough now not to spread through the woods , ” John Cupps .
The fire chief says at this point , all signs point to the chimney as what sparked the fire .
The house is destroyed .
Australian scientists from the University of Queensland ( UoQ ) , announced today that they have discovered an embryo inside a 250 million year old `` terrible headed lizard '' fossilfrom China .
Professor Jonathan Aitchison from UoQ said this discovery was the first concrete evidenceof live birth for this prehistoric animal group , previously only ever thought to lay eggs .
`` Live birth is well known in mammals , where the mother has a placenta to nourish thedeveloping embryo , '' Aitchison said .
`` Live birth is also very common among lizards and snakes , where the babies sometimeshatch ' inside their mother and emerge without a shelled egg . ''
The fossil fell into the category of an archosauromorph , a marine animal with anincredibly long neck , that roamed the shallows seas in the southern parts of China in themiddle of the Triassic period .
Scientists extracted the fossil from the Luoing Biota sites in south-west China , and wereshocked by the find , showing them something that no-one previously had known to bepossible .
Professor Jun Liu , from the Hefei University of Technology , said that he was thrilled whenhe saw the specimen , but was unsure whether the embryo inside was `` the mother 's lastlunch '' or in fact her baby .
`` Upon further preparation and closer inspection , we discovered something unusual , '' Liusaid
`` Further evolutionary analysis revealed the first case of live birth in such a wide groupcontaining birds , crocodilians , dinosaurs and pterosaurs , among others , and pushes backevidence of reproductive biology in the group by 50 million years . ''
According to the city , workers from Kramer Technical Services started preparing the Rhythm City barge porte cochere for demolition today .
Tear down and removal of the structure is expected to start on Tuesday .
The City of Keokuk voted to take the barge back in May . It was hoped at the time that river levels would be low enough to send the barge to Keokuk at the end of May , but so far , that has not happened .
Nothing has changed since Aylan Kurdi 's death shocked the world
Two Italian nongovernmental organizations on Tuesday made a global call for people to wear red shirts on Saturday to remind everyone about the plight of refugees all around the globe .
The call was made by Gruppo Abele and Libera , both NGOs founded by Italian priest Luigi Ciotti who is known for his fight against organized crime such as the Mafia .
Ciotti published the call on Gruppo Abele 's website , under the title `` Wear a red shirt to stop the mankind 's bleeding wound . ''
According to Ciotti , the color red was chosen specifically as it was worn by three–year-old Aylan Kurdi who washed upon the shores of Bodrum in Turkey after drowning during his journey with his parents from war-torn Syria to Europe .
The photo of Aylan with his red shirt became a symbol of the global immigration crisis and a reminder of how dire the situation was .
`` This photo of Aylan touched and ashamed everyone around the globe . Three children who also drowned off the coast of Libya were wearing red , '' wrote Ciotti in the announcement .
`` Let 's stop for a day and wear red shirts for a single day , just like those children who are mankind 's legacy . ''
Ciotti added that modern Europe is all about freedom and equality .
His comments come at a time Italy has drawn ire for denying entry to several NGO ships carrying hundreds of refugees , causing them to get stranded at sea . Italy and Malta denied port to such vessels on two separate occasions , but Spain offered to take in the dejected rescue boats .
Italian Interior Minister Matteo Salvini 's decision to deny migrant boats from docking in Italy sparked a heated debate between EU countries on how to handle the waves of migrants .
FOX FUND : Money is now available to help councils implement plans to manage the impact of flying fox colonies on their residents and ratepayers .
FRESH funding is now available to help councils implement plans to manage the impact of flying fox colonies on their residents and ratepayers , according to Local Government NSW ( LGNSW ) .
The peak body has announced the opening of access to further competitive funding within Stream 3 as part of the $ 1 million Flying-Fox Grant Program , which is funded by the Office of Environment and Heritage and administered by LGNSW .
Two initial funding streams - both of which will remain open until April 30 - provided funding to support emergency measures and the development of longer-term management plans for communities impacted by the native Australian mammal often referred to as a fruit bat .
`` Flying foxes are a protected species and play a crucial role in pollinating native forests and spreading seeds to ensure longevity of the Australian bush , ” an LGNSW spokeswoman said .
`` During the day they gather in large roosts known as camps , which consist of hundreds to tens of thousands of individual creatures and are formed in seemingly random locations .
`` But in recent times these camps have come into greater and greater collision with residential areas - possibly due to the greater reliable food supply offered by native eucalypt plantings and backyard fruit trees . ”
A number of councils , including Clarence Valley , have already successfully accessed funding to develop long-term camp management plans and to implement actions in approved plans .
`` The goal is to protect the amenity of life for residents in impacted areas without further threatening this ecologically important native species , ” the spokeswoman said .

Customer privacy and fear of hackers are two big issues . “ The risk is that someone can remotely know where you are and even worse take some control of the car , ” he said . Theoretically , someone could slam on the brakes at the push of a button . ”
Former Clemson All-American Brian Dawkins has been named to the 2018 NFL Hall of Fame Class . Dawkins , who was in his second year of eligibility , is the first former Clemson player to be named to the NFL Hall of Fame .
Dawkins lettered at Clemson from 1992-95 as a safety . He was named a second-team All-American by the Associated Press and The Sporting News after his senior year . He was named a second-team All-ACC defensive back in 1993 and 1994 , then was a first-team selection as a senior in 1995 .
During the 1995 season , Dawkins had 89 tackles , including 60 first hits in starting all 12 games . He had six interceptions to lead the ACC and rank eighth in the nation , for 55 return yards and a touchdown . He also had nine passes broken up to lead a Clemson defense that finished 10th in the nation in scoring defense and 16th in pass defense .
He tied a Clemson record with three interceptions against Duke in 1995 . All three of the thefts came in one quarter , still the only Clemson player to have three thefts in a quarter . He was named National Defensive Player of the Week by Sports Illustrated for that performance against the Blue Devils .
The Clemson graduate finished his career with 15 takeaways , still tied for fifth in school history , as he had 11 interceptions and four fumble recoveries . He finished with 251 total tackles in 46 games , 35 as a starter . He had four fumble recoveries , four forced fumbles and three blocked kicks . He had two sacks and nine tackles for loss to go with 23 passes broken up and 34 total passes defended .
Dawkins played in the 1996 Senior Bowl , then was drafted in the second round by the Philadelphia Eagles , the 61st selection of the draft .
Dawkins played 16 years in the National Football League between 1996 and 2011 , He played with the Eagles from 1996-08 and with the Denver Broncos from 2009-11 . His uniform number-20 has been retired by the Eagles , one of just nine players in the 80 years of that franchise so honored .
In those 16 years in the NFL he was named to the Pro Bowl nine times , more than any other Clemson player . In fact his nine selections to a professional all-star game are more than any former Clemson athlete in any sport . Dawkins was named to the NFL All-Rookie Team in 1996 and was an All-Pro selection in 2001 , 2002 , 2004 , 2006 and 2009 .
Dawkins finished with 1,131 tackles 37 interceptions , 26 sacks , 120 pass deflections , 36 forced fumbles and 19 fumble recoveries in 224 career games ( 221 starts ) .
The native of Jacksonville , Fla. is one of just six players in NFL history with 25 sacks and 25 interceptions in his career . He 's the only player in NFL history to record a sack , interception , fumble recovery and touchdown catch in same game against the Houston Texans in 2002 . Dawkins was selected as a First Team member of the Pro Football Hall of Fame All-Decade Team in the 2000s .
“ Brian Dawkins has represented this football program , this University , with distinction for over 25 years , ” said Clemson Head Coach Dabo Swinney . “ He had a terrific career at Clemson , then had an even better career in the NFL with Philadelphia and Denver .
“ It was not just his accomplishments on the field , it is his character , his leadership , the respect that people have for him , that stand out . For years I have dealt with NFL scouts , coaches , and general managers and I ca n't tell you how many times they have told me stories of Brian Dawkins .
“ Now with his selection , he is the first former Clemson football player to be inducted into the NFL Hall of Fame . It is a fitting honor . ”

`` Frankly , the judging was just off , '' George Shea , the longtime Coney Island announcer , told the Associated Press . `` Joey said , 'Look at my plates ' and Carmen said , 'Look at my plates . ' We counted the plates that they had eaten and it was 64 and 74 . ''
ISLAMABAD , Jul 4 ( APP ) : Caretaker Minister for Information , Broadcasting , National History and Literary Heritage Barrister Syed Ali Zafar on Wednesday said the caretaker government would ensure general election on July 25 .
Delay in elections were mere rumours as political parties had already started election campaign with full swing , he said while talking to a private news channel .
He said polling stations in different areas were categorized according to their sensitivity .
About construction of water reservoirs , he said the caretaker government was not responsible to build dams in a short period of time .
To a question regarding situation in Lahore after heavy rain , he said it was not appropriate to blame the present government for the situation emerged after the heavy rains .
To another question , the minister said ECP was responsible to handle the scheme of the polling stations and voting system . The government will act upon the directives of the ECP in that regard , he added .
“ We are fully satisfied with the briefing given by ECP regarding the arrangements for the upcoming election , “ he said .
All the institutions including judiciary and investigative agencies were working in their constitutional domain , he said , adding empowering the institutions was imperative for smooth running of the system .
With 67 per cent of Canadians facing an average of $ 22,084 in debts after graduating from university – and only 49 per cent actually working in jobs that require a university degree according to CareerBuilder – sometimes exploring other career avenues may be a viable option .
One area of the job market that is currently in demand , however , are jobs in trades .

“ The job market is good and we are seeing a growth in demand from employers for trade jobs , ” Jodi Kasten , managing director at Indeed Canada , says . “ Demand in general contractors on Indeed , for example , increased 111 per cent since 2016 . This could be attributed to the strong housing and condo boom in major cities across Canada , ”
Another thing to consider , Kasten says , is that as a society , we need tradespeople .
“ Their work impacts nearly every aspect of our lives , ” she says . “ They help build and maintain the homes we live in for example , and people will always need an electrician for electrical work or a plumber for plumbing work . ”
And if you 're analytical and good at problem-solving , these jobs will be right up your alley , Kasten says .
Math skills are also important and so are soft skills as you 're often dealing with clients and suppliers to complete a job , she adds .

HARARE , Feb 2 ( Reuters ) - Zimbabwe should press on with transparent and fair land reform , Britain said on Friday , as Harare 's new leaders look to overhaul policies that evicted thousands of white farmers without compensation .
Under former president Robert Mugabe , authorities carried out often violent seizures of white-owned farms in a bid to address what they called injustices during British colonial rule .
But new President Emmerson Mnangagwa - keen to boost the economy and mend ties with countries that imposed sanctions on Zimbabwe - has said he wants to end discrimination between black and white farmers and is working to compensate those who lost their properties .
Britain 's Minister of State for Africa , Harriet Baldwin , said she discussed the land issue with Mnangagwa in Harare on Friday .
“ Obviously the UK government very much welcomes the statements that have been made about land reform by the government of Zimbabwe and we support a transparent and fair and mediated process around that , ” Baldwin told reporters .
“ It 's also something which is very important as a signal to international investors and so it 's important and we welcome the fact that the president has made a commitment in terms of continuing with that process . ”
Zimbabwe sees mending relations with former colonial ruler Britain as a critical step towards re-establishing ties with the West and international financial institutions .
LEASES , TRIBUNAL
Under Mugabe , the government argued that it would only pay for buildings and equipment on farms but not the land , which it said had been expropriated from locals during the colonial era .
Mugabe , who was forced to step down after a de facto military coup in November , argued that Britain should pay compensation for the land because the farmers were its “ kith and kin ” .
When asked whether Britain would help pay the farmers , Baldwin said she welcomed “ the statements that the president has made on that front ” . She did not elaborate .
Land ownership is a highly sensitive topic in Zimbabwe . Colonialists seized some of the best agricultural land and much of it remained in the hands of white farmers after independence in 1980 , while many blacks were landless .
The government has said it will issue 99-year leases to white farmers , according to a government circular .
Earlier this month a government document showed that Zimbabwe was considering establishing a special tribunal to determine the value of compensation and how to pay it to white farmers who have lost land since 2000 . ( Reporting by MacDonald Dzirutwe ; Editing by Andrew Heavens )
Rescue teams in northern Thailand were giving crash courses in swimming and diving on Wednesday as part of preparations to extract a young soccer squad trapped in a cave and keen to end a harrowing 11-day ordeal . A team of divers , medics , counselors and Thai navy SEALS were with the 12 schoolboys and their 25-year-old coach , providing medicines and food while experts assessed conditions for getting them out , a task the government said would not be easy . `` The water is very strong and space is narrow . Extracting the children takes a lot of people , '' Deputy Prime Minister Prawit Wongsuwan told reporters .
`` Now we are teaching the children to swim and dive , '' he said adding that if water levels fell and the flow weakened , they would be taken out quickly .
A video released by the SEALS on Wednesday showed two rescuers in wetsuits sitting on a elevated part of the cave beside the boys wrapped in emergency foil blankets . They appeared to be in good spirits , occasionally laughing . It was not immediately clear when the footage was taken .
A torch is shone on each boy , who is a one by one say hello and introduce themselves with head bowed and hands clasped together in a traditional `` wai '' Thai greeting .
A young player in the foreground wears what appears to be the red England soccer jersey worn by the team in Tuesday 's World Cup victory over Colombia in Moscow . Another younger boy wears the blue shirt of English team Chelsea .
They were discovered by the SEALS and two British cave diving experts on Monday , having been incommunicado and in darkness since June 23 , when a group outing at the caves led to a high-profile search and rescue effort .
News that the `` Wild Boar '' team had survived sparked celebrations and relief in a country transfixed by the drama , with almost blanket media coverage .
The rescue teams and volunteers were hailed as heroes in an outpouring of joy and relief on social media , and applauded by the country 's prime minister , Prayuth Chan-ocha .
Efforts to open a communications line between the trapped team located 4 km ( 2.5 miles ) from the mouth of the cave suffered a setback after equipment fell into the water , Chiang Rai Governor Narongsak Osottanakorn said on Wednesday .
The authorities were keen to get the boys out as soon as possible , but not if it was unsafe .
`` All 13 do n't have to come out at the same time . Who is ready first can go first , '' he told reporters .
`` If there are risks then we will not be extracting them . ''
The focus is now on monitoring water levels , rain forecasts and extraction procedures . As of late Tuesday , some 120 million liters of water had been pumped out of the cave .
Officials on Tuesday dismissed as speculation reports that the boys could be trapped for up to four months . Supplies have been prepared for that period of time , however .
Chinese consumers will be biting into domestic cherries , while the country seeks to import from other countries , including Turkey , after July 6 , when China is expected to impose a 25 percent border tax on hundreds of American goods , said Zhao Xiaoyu , a Beijing fruit merchant .
Simmering trade tensions between the world 's top two economies are set to erupt into a full-blown trade war Friday , with Washington poised to impose new tariffs on $ 34 billion on Chinese goods .
Beijing has pledged to hit back dollar for dollar , placing a new tax on American goods like cherries , soybeans , autos , pork and whiskey , putting them at a disadvantage to their global rivals .
Washington 's list is heavy on tech goods , aiming in part to shift supply chains away from China , while Beijing has put politically sensitive U.S. farm goods in the firing line .
To lessen the self-inflicted shock , Beijing is searching for replacements .
The looming trade war also has U.S. traders and growers worried . U.S . Senator Ron Wyden blasted Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross last month , noting that growers with 1.5 million boxes of cherries ready for China had come to him in a panic .
`` They 're worried those cherries are going to end up stuck at the dock or rotting in a warehouse due to China 's retaliation , '' Wyden said .
Zhao , the Beijing cherry importer , said existing contracts for this year 's cherry harvest would make it hard to stop buying American cherries altogether .
`` If we lose some money on contracts this year , there 's nothing we can do about it , '' said Zhao . `` If it 's still going on next year , we 'll go straight to Turkey and Uzbekistan . ''
Ranking first in cherry production and third in exports in global statistics , Turkey aims to become the main shareholder in the Chinese market , one of the largest consumers in the world .
The country has recently received a permit to export cherries to China , after almost eight years of technical and diplomatic work , as well as a series of negotiations between Turkish exporters and Chinese authorities .
As a result of initiatives by the Ministry of Food , Agriculture and Livestock and the Ministry of Economy last year to send products to China after the European Union ( EU ) , Russia and the U.S. , the classic markets for cherries , the Chinese government granted permits to nine Turkish companies for cherry imports , which will start this year .
Seasonal conditions this year and the early start of the cherry harvest reflect positively on Turkey 's cherry exports , which might hit a record high this year , about 85,000 tons with a value of $ 200 million , officials previously said .
According to Uludağ Fresh Fruits and Vegetables Exporters ' Association 's ( UYMSİB ) umbrella organization Uludağ Exporters ' Association ( UİB ) , Turkey 's cherry exports in the first five months rose by 184 percent compared to the same period last year , reaching $ 54 million .
UİB figures also showed that the amount of cherry exports increased by 165 percent to 20,404 tons in the January to May period .
The highest export figure was recorded in 2016 - amounting 78,700 tons with a revenue of $ 182.7 million , whereas last year Turkey 's cherry export totaled 65,000 tons with a yield worth $ 159 million .

A new report reveals that the BMW iNEXT will likely be a larger SUV , outsizing the upcoming BMW iX3 .
Automotive News nailed down a source inside Munich to all but confirm that the BMW iNEXT will be an SUV . Further , it will probably come in a mid-size configuration . We already reported that it may be similar in size to the Jaguar I-Pace and BMW Blog has been confidently sharing similar information related to the mystery vehicle .
BMW Blog previously shared :
According to BMW , the upcoming iNEXT will begin production at the Dingolfing plant in 2021 and will be some sort of electric crossover . While BMW just claims that it will be a “ larger vehicle ” sources inside BMW claim that it 's similar in size and shape to the Jaguar I-Pace .
The iNEXT is touted by BMW as a new flagship to its upcoming line of electric vehicles . It 's slated to follow the iX3 , which is due out in 2020 . The automaker 's recent teaser showed a roofline similar to that of vehicles like the Jaguar I-Pace and other modern SUVs .
While some will argue that the I-Pace is n't a true SUV and neither are vehicles like Hyundai 's Kona nor the Kia Niro , many of today 's SUVs are arguably crossovers by nature . They 're built on the frame of a car with unibody construction , but offer a higher ride height , more ground clearance , and increased utility . It is become more commonly accepted to lump SUVs and crossovers together in the same class/category , as the “ old ” body-on-frame vehicles are becoming few and far between .
BMW is set to reveal the official concept later this year to give us a better idea of the reality of such claims . BMW Blog reports that the automaker 's CEO said :
Later this year , we will be presenting the BMW iNEXT as a Vision Vehicle .
It 's not known which show BMW will choose to debut the vehicle , but the publication is speculating that it might show its face at the Paris Auto Show this fall . The premiere is supposed to reveal BMW 's future vision related to the iNEXT line . It will come with a minimum of Level 3 autonomy , courtesy of the likes of MobilEye and Intel . Also , we do know that it should have a range greater than 400 miles .

The Turkish Foreign Ministry on Tuesday criticized the United Arab Emirates ( UAE ) foreign minister 's remarks on Operation Olive Branch in Syria 's Afrin , saying his comments could in no way be `` an indication of goodwill . ''
The statement released on the foreign ministry 's official website said that Turkey is aware of the real intentions behind the UAE authorities ' recent statements , which could be interpreted as a smear campaign .
The statement came after the UAE Foreign Minister Abdullah bin Zayed al-Nahyan said that Turkey was conducting an intervention in Syria and posing a threat to the Arab world .
The ministry said in response that Turkey 's strong historical and exceptional ties with the Arab world and its support to their common causes , Jerusalem in particular , is well-known .
`` The Afrin operation by the Turkish Armed Forces is aimed at eliminating the terror threat against the country , '' the statement read .
In December , the UAE foreign minister caused another dispute between the two countries after he accused Ottoman commander Fahreddin Pasha , the defender of Medina during World War I of committing crimes against the locals in the city .
The remarks received harsh criticism from top Turkish politicians , including President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan , who said Ottomans had done nothing but serve to protect the holy cities of Islam .
Turkey launched Operation Olive Branch on Jan. 20 to clear terrorist groups from Afrin in northwestern Syria amid growing threats posed from the region .
On Sunday , Turkish-backed troops liberated the town of Afrin , which had been a major hideout for the YPG/PKK since 2012 .
According to the Turkish General Staff , Operation Olive Branch has aimed to establish security and stability along Turkey 's borders and the region as well as protect Syrians from the cruelty and oppression of terrorists .
The operation is being carried out under the framework of Turkey 's rights based on international law , U.N. Security Council resolutions , its self-defense rights under the U.N. Charter and respect for Syria 's territorial integrity , it said .
HONOLULU ( Reuters ) - Molten rock from several lava-spewing fissures opened by Kilauea Volcano crept toward clusters of homes and vacation rentals on the eastern tip of Hawaii 's Big Island on Wednesday , as authorities ushered residents from the area as a precaution .
Volcanic gases rise from the Kilauea lava flow that crossed Pohoiki Road near Highway 132 , near Pahoa , Hawaii , U.S. , May 28 , 2018 . REUTERS/Marco Garcia
Evacuation of the Vacationland development and adjacent Kapoho community , rebuilt after a destructive eruption of Kilauea in 1960 , came on the 28th day of what geologists rank as one of the biggest upheavals in a century from one of the world 's most active volcanoes .
The Hawaii County Civil Defense agency issued the advisory as lava flows picked up speed late on Tuesday and early on Wednesday and threatened to cut off a key traffic route into the seaside area on the far eastern flank of the volcano .
“ Residents in the Kapoho area , including Kapoho Beach Lots and Vacationland , are advised to evacuate , ” the agency said in a morning bulletin . “ You are at risk of being isolated due to possible lava inundation of Beach Road . ”
On Tuesday , a lava stream crossed a larger east-west route , Highway 132 , as it advanced toward Kapoho . A separate flow of red-hot molten rock was headed in the direction of the Vacationland Hawaii community to the south .
Civil defence officials also cited the problem of widespread communication outages in the area due to downed power and phone lines , reinforcing the decision to proceed with evacuation plans immediately rather than wait for a potential emergency .
Residents of the area , part of the Island of Hawaii 's Puna district , were urged to stay tuned to local radio stations for further updates .
The numbers of people and homes affected by the evacuation were not immediately known . They join some 2,000 residents displaced due to lava flows and toxic sulphur dioxide gas emissions at the outset of the eruption nearly four weeks ago farther west , in and around the Leilani Estates community .
Kilauea 's main crater at the volcano 's summit has continued to periodically belch ash high up into the sky . But National Weather Service meteorologist Tom Birchard told reporters during a conference call that most of the ash was blowing out to sea on the prevailing trade winds , then dissipating quickly .
Nevertheless , some ash and fumes have been spouted high enough into the atmosphere to be carried far over the Pacific Ocean , with observers in the Marshall Islands , Micronesia and Guam detecting traces of vog - a hazy mix of sulphur dioxide , aerosols , moisture and fine particles , Birchard said .
Kilauea rumbled back to life on May 3 as it began extruding lava and toxic gases through a series of cracks in the ground on its eastern flank , marking the latest phase of an eruption cycle that has continued nearly nonstop for 35 years .
The occurrence of new lava vents , or fissures , now numbering about two dozen , have been accompanied by flurries of earthquakes and intermittent eruptions from the summit crater . More than 40 homes and other structures have been consumed by lava flows since then .

SA funds talk on ending sexual assault

April 13 , Student Assembly sponsored an event entitled “ How to End Rape on Campus ” as a part of the College of William and Mary 's Sexual Assault Awareness Month .
Speakers Sofie Karasek and Annie Clark co-founded a national group called End Rape on Campus , which inspired the creation of the documentary “ The Hunting Ground . ”
Karasek herself is a subject in the documentary , as well as an advocate for victims of sexual assault . Much of her work has been featured in national media , such as New York Times and the Washington Post . Clark is also an advocate of sexual assault awareness and has presented work on women 's issues to the United Nations .
Additionally , she was listed alongside former U.S. President Barack Obama as one of the most influential figures in higher education .
Karasek attended the University of California , Berkeley and got involved in a student organization , went on an off-campus retreat and then was sexually assaulted by one of the leaders of the organization .
“ We found out shortly after I came back to campus that he had actually systemically been doing this to first year girls in this particular club that he was on the board of , ” Karasek said .
Karasek said she attempted to have the perpetrator resign from leadership of the club , but this did not end up happening . Less than a month later , she said he sexually assaulted another club member . Karasek said that at this point , the university was aware of the situation , but told her to keep quiet about it .
“ We ended up reporting him after the latest assault , and the university did n't end up investigating it , ” Karasek said . “ They put him on disciplinary probation and let him graduate earlier . As a result , he now attends Harvard Law School . ”
Clark grew up in Raleigh , N.C. and attended the University of North Carolina , Chapel Hill . She said that she was used to having control in her life .
“ I knew what I wanted to study , I knew I wanted to play sports , ” Clark said . “ I could control a ball on the soccer field , I could control how I studied in class and my grades … but I was not prepared for what happened to me . ”
When she was first sexually assaulted , Clark said that she tried to push the experience to the back of her mind , but eventually needed help . It was at this point that Clark said she experienced a common response of victims of sexual assault : victim blaming .
“ I reached out to a university employee who should have known what they were doing , ” Clark said . “ This employee told me that rape was like a football game , that I was the quarterback and in charge of my situation . ”
Karasek and Clark went on to address common myths about sexual assault , including the belief that it only happens to females .
“ One in six boys will be sexually assaulted before they 're 18 , and actually as a man you 're more likely to be sexually assaulted than to be a perpetrator of it , ” Karasek said . “ So this is very much an issue that impacts everyone . ”
They also cited statistics that showed racial and sexual minorities are sexually assaulted at higher rates over the course of their lives . 18.8 percent of black women , 34.1 percent of Native American women , 21.1 percent of Latina women and 50 percent of bisexual individuals will experience sexual assault in their lifetimes .
Another myth Karasek and Clark tried to “ debunk ” is that some extraneous factors such as alcohol consumption or revealing clothing can be the cause of sexual assault . Karasek and Clark said that the only true cause of sexual assault is the person who commits the assault . They argued that rhetoric about not going out late at night or watching one 's drink should be replaced with efforts to prevent sexual assault .
“ Do n't tell us not to get raped , tell people not to rape , ” Clark said .
In terms of making a change , Clark said it comes about on an individual level in instances of everyday life .
“ If you 're sitting around watching March Madness or whatnot and there 's a commercial that comes on , and it is degrading to women or it 's racist or it 's in some way problematic , it 's calling that out … this is something anybody can do , ” Clark said . “ You do n't need to stand on a stage and talk about this to make a difference . ”
Karasek and Clark also addressed how to help a friend who is a victim of sexual assault .
“ [ It is important ] to recognize that people are at all different spaces and stages and need different things and to offer support instead of judgment and trying to play the investigator , ” Clark said .
Karasek added that it is easy to feel pressure to fix the situation , but it is necessary to remember that listening goes a long way .
Sen. Brendan Boylan '19 wrote a bill that went along with SA 's Survivor Solidarity Resolution to provide the funding necessary to bring Clark and Karasek to campus .
“ This is a huge problem and we need to tackle it and we can do it right here at William and Mary where we do have those problems , but we can do better , ” Boylan said .
Boylan spoke about the importance of the issue of rape on college campuses , adding that he was surprised by the statistic that 40 percent of colleges nationwide have reported zero instances of sexual assault .
“ There 's no such thing as zero percent , ” Boylan said .
College President Taylor Reveley also attended the event , and said that it was important to him as part of the College 's larger effort to pay more attention to sexual assault .
“ It 's very important because we 're really working hard at William and Mary to prevent sexual assault , sexual harassment , and if we ca n't prevent it , to respond quickly and effectively , ” Reveley said . “ I think we 've made a huge amount [ of progress ] . First of all , it 's just gotten a lot more focused attention and we 've put more staff resources on it , more programmatic resources , we 've created the Haven , and I think we 're really … beginning to get peoples ' attention . ”

The country has made a significant leap in terms of the losses incurred in the energy sector . There is a significant decrease in the load shedding this year , especially during the month of Ramazan . If the energy sector only requires an investment of $ 40-50 billion in the transmission and distribution system to completely end load shedding , this is a huge milestone achieved by the authorities . While one should commend the government for its efforts , these developments always raise some questions . These developments are never consistent , the country faces periods of less load shedding with claims of the problem being solved but the solution is never permanent and we go back into the same loop again . Same concerns are being raised this time as well - will these measures last a while or are they temporary fixes to appease voters before the next general elections ?
Despite reaching a 20,100MW milestone this Monday during peak hours , this power could not be fully transmitted . This is because of the outdated transmission system and this is a proof that the policies and measures are never framed in a holistic manner and that affects the output . It should not be difficult to discern that the answer lies in understanding the problem completely . Policies only targeting investment and not focusing on transmission lines will only again result in the consumers suffering at the end .
Another area that the government must target is the financial crimes in the energy sector . All those influential people who do not pay their bills put the burden on those less privileged . The system in turn also favours and protects those influential people by not cutting out their power supplies in cases of lack of payment , but the less privileged suffer on the non-payment of one electricity bill . If the system in place protects those with influence , then there will always be an aspect of the energy crisis which will never be resolved . At the same time , the provincial government needs to cooperate with the electricity suppliers to ensure that this crime ends . The energy crisis can be resolved if a system of accountability is put in place and ad-hoc measures are not taken without any regard for the future .

From planning romantic dinners to sending flowers , Valentine 's Day has a way of putting pressure on couples . And as it turns out , the occasion also puts the heat on parents . Laurel Gregory explains .
On Wednesday evening , the Ventura Police Department received a call about a homeless man “ yelling and being disruptive ” in the city 's promenade area , a bustling boardwalk flush with restaurants .
Officers in the area were busy , so police decided to monitor the man on a surveillance camera , ultimately deciding he was not a threat .
Hours later , police said , the man entered a nearby steakhouse and plunged a knife into the neck of Anthony Mele Jr. , fatally wounding the 35-year-old while his wife and daughter looked on in horror .
Mele 's killing has roiled the city : Some residents are highly critical of police for failing to send officers after the initial complaint . Advocates for the homeless fear the attack could reverse the city 's progress in reaching out to its most vulnerable residents .

The slaying also highlights the difficulty police face in interacting with people who are homeless or mentally ill . In some cities , including Los Angeles , law enforcement has been accused of over-policing the homeless community , leading to encounters that sometimes turn deadly . But in Ventura , many believe the lack of a police response may have led to Mele 's death .
Ventura Police Chief Ken Corney said Monday that officers should have responded to the initial call , adding that an administrative review is underway .
“ Our practice is not to handle these calls by security cameras . It is to put boots on the ground , ” he told The Times .
But outrage had already spread through the community . Rebecca Mele said she is furious with police in the wake of her son 's killing , and has demanded that city leaders do more to address Ventura 's homeless population .
“ To the mayor , I say , 'What are you doing ? ' ” she said . “ This is your city , and so are the homeless people . We should have something to provide for them . It 's very hard . I understand there were complaints [ about the suspect 's behavior ] , the police did n't answer , and now my son is dead . ”

Dozens showed up at a City Council meeting Monday evening to vent frustrations over how the city is handling the homeless population .
“ We have been devastated by the fires , and we are now being run out by vagrants , ” said one speaker , adding that her kids have found men with spoons and needles in their yard . Her comments drew cheers and applause .
In a statement last week , police promised to increase patrols in the promenade area , a move that has drawn concern from social workers and homeless advocates .
Ventura County 's homeless population has decreased annually since 2012 , and the number of homeless people in the city of Ventura dropped by more than 50 % in the same time frame , according to a countywide study conducted last year . Some advocates fear that a strong police response to the stabbing might scare people away from services they desperately need .

“ We are hoping it does n't result in a setback for the movement that has been happening in the county and city , ” said Susan Brinkmeyer , former director of Lift Your Voice , a program under the Unitarian Universalist Church of Ventura that provides services to the homeless . “ We 're not going to solve anything by rousting people , but rather by dealing with it by creating a solution . ”
Brinkmeyer hoped fallout from the stabbing would not lead to generalizations about the city 's homeless community .
“ I know at the moment there is a good deal of anger and a sense that the individual who committed the assault is homeless , and that may lead to a backlash against all homeless people , ” she said . “ As a community , we need to help those that are homeless . ”
Corney said the department received a call about a man yelling and being disruptive on the promenade near the Crowne Plaza Hotel at 6:23 p.m. on Wednesday . All patrol units in the area were “ tied up on other calls , ” according to Corney , who did not disclose the nature of those calls .
A decision was made at the department 's 911 operations center to observe the man on a security camera trained on the pier .
“ They did n't see any behavior that appeared to be concerning or significantly disruptive , ” the chief said .
The man , 49-year-old Jamal Jackson , entered the nearby Aloha Steakhouse at 9:09 p.m. and slashed Mele in the neck with a 4- to 5-inch hunting knife while the victim sat at a table , according to Cmdr . Tom Higgins .
“ It was so quick , my son turned and was stabbed while he 's holding his daughter , ” Rebecca Mele , 57 , said .
Jackson has been charged with murder and is being held without bail . He is due in court this week .

Officers should have eventually been dispatched to the area to contact the man once they completed other calls , Corney said . The department is reviewing the way it uses surveillance cameras to monitor calls for service , Higgins said .
The officers in the dispatch center did not know the man they were observing was Jackson , a homeless man with a lengthy criminal record in Ventura and San Bernardino counties who had been arrested by city police a month earlier .
Jackson has prior convictions for burglary and statutory rape in Ventura County , Senior Dist . Atty . Richard Simon said . He has also been arrested several times in San Bernardino County , most recently in 2014 , when he was charged with assault with a deadly weapon , making criminal threats and false imprisonment , according to court records .
Jackson pleaded guilty to the false imprisonment charge as part of a negotiated plea deal in 2016 , records show . Calls and e-mails to the San Bernardino County district attorney 's office were not returned Monday . Corney said Jackson was not on parole or probation at the time of the killing .
I 'm angry . My colleagues are angry , and yet , we understand that there is a limitation on what might be appropriate action . Ventura Mayor Neal Andrews
Jackson was arrested by Ventura Police in a March domestic violence incident , according to Simon .
“ It 's a horrible attack , ” Simon said . “ No one expects to go to a restaurant with their family and be stabbed as they hold their daughter . ”
Ventura Mayor Neal Andrews said he was “ concerned ” by the decision not to approach Jackson .
“ While he apparently did not exhibit any behavior warranting immediate intervention , my concern was still the response was canceled instead of followed up later than other calls were managed and handled , ” he said .

Violent crime is rare in the community — the stabbing marked the city 's first homicide of the year — and Andrews said anger over the attack has been palpable . He has received e-mails from residents demanding the city outlaw panhandling , or conduct aggressive arrests along the promenade and pier area where homeless people are known to congregate .
“ People get angry about situations like this and it 's totally , totally , understandable , ” Andrews said . “ I 'm angry . My colleagues are angry , and yet , we understand that there is a limitation on what might be appropriate action . ”
Some policing experts said the situation is indicative of a larger problem in law enforcement . At a time when trust between police and the citizens they are sworn to protect is shaky , officers are less likely to interact with a homeless or mentally ill person because the situation could end in a deadly use of force or community backlash .
“ The national tone at this point is he has an illness and enforcement is disfavored . Enforcement can be construed as harassment pretty quickly , ” said Eugene O'Donnell , a former New York City police officer and professor at the John Jay School of Criminal Justice in Manhattan . “ He 's on the street , he 's not committing a crime , and you 're gon na roust him with a heavy hand ? ”
Mele said police and city leaders should expect continued outrage over their handling of her son 's death .
“ It 's a sick thing , '' she said . “ My son was a wonderful , loving father . His daughter loved him to death… . He was an all-around good guy and a good son . ”

New members that joined the MCP include Khumbo Chirwa ( former minster ) , Catherine Gotani ( former minister ) , Ken Zokhale Ng'oma ( former State House chief of staff ) , Major Harry Soko retired , Mayor Williams Mkandawire , Joseph Mwaluka , Adam Gondwe , Richard Ngulube ( NASAF Governor ) , Benex Mwamlima , and Aisha Fwatuma .
The joining of the ten into the party is a boost in its rebuilding process in the run-up to the 2019 elections .
“ It 's time to bury the hatchet . Let 's forgive each other , and we move forward . This is the step everyone should have in mind as we prepare to get into government .
“ Let 's allow new members to join us , that in majority we remove this failed Democratic Progressive Party ( DPP ) from power , for Malawians to realize better governance after 2019 , ” Chakwera said
At the Katoto rally , also present was Richard Msowoya ( MCP vice president ) , Gustavo Kaliwo ( MCP Secretary-General ) and his deputy Chatonda Kaunda , Jessie Kabwira ( MCP Publicity Secretary ) , Joseph Njovuyalema , Sidik Mia , Harry Mkandawire and over 40 MCP lawmakers .

John Pullen was a jack of all trades , according to Blair Pullen . He worked as a contractor and as a personal trainer .
“ It kind of hits me at certain moments , so sometimes I get really happy about all the memories and sometimes I just break down and cry , ” Blair Pullen said . “ He did a lot of big things and he just had the biggest heart . ”
John Pullen 's family friend , Curtis Rine , was saddened by the news .
“ I wish he had more time on this earth to enjoy time with his family and continue to workout like he loved to do , ” Rine said .
Rine first met John Pullen eight years ago and was happy he had the chance to reconnect just a few weeks ago .

A month after President Donald Trump pulled the U.S. out of the Paris Climate Accord , Hollywood 's major studios and the Producers Guild of America have teamed on a Green Production Guide to cut carbon emissions .
Disney , Amblin Partners , 20th Century Fox , NBCUniversal , Paramount Pictures , Sony Pictures Entertainment , and Warner Bros. Entertainment have collaborated on the guide . The guide was developed with research from “ successfully sustainable ” projects such as “ The Fate of the Furious , ” “ Fifty Shades Darker , ” “ Jason Bourne , ” “ War for the Planet of the Apes , ” “ Daddy 's Home , ” “ Legion , ” “ Spider-Man : Homecoming , ” “ The Blacklist , ” “ Beauty and the Beast , ” “ Black-ish , ” “ Quantico , ” and “ Pretty Little Liars . ”
The guide includes the Production Environmental Actions Checklist ( PEACH ) ; a link between the Green Production Guide 's PEACH and new partner Environmental Media Association to facilitate the completion of the nonprofit 's “ EMA Green Seal ” application , which has been given to “ Better Call Saul , ” “ Hidden Figures , ” and “ Rogue One : A Star Wars Story ” ; and the Production Environmental Accounting Report ( PEAR ) , a carbon calculator which computes a production 's carbon emissions .
The guide includes a searchable database of over 2,000 recommended eco-vendors including information about their green products , services , production experience , and service locations .
“ The most effective way to advance sustainable production is to align best practices , so the PGA collaborated closely with our studio partners in creating this resource , ” said Mari-Jo Winkler , chair of PGA Green .
“ These tools give us the data to continuously improve our sustainability practices and achieve greener productions , ” said John Rego , VP of environmental sustainability at Sony Pictures Entertainment .
For the eighth time , Everett Buick GMC in Benton has won Dealer of the Year in sales and service for both the Buick and GMC divisions .
The dealership is the only one in the state of Arkansas to ever win the title .
The award is based on facility , sales , customer experience and customer service retention . According to general manager Jerry Odom , only four are awarded per region . Everett Buick GMC is in the South Central Region .
“ I feel it reflects on the good job our employees are doing and our customers notice , ” said Susie Everett , co-owner of the Everett Family of Dealerships , noting that the employees work hard and do what they say they will do .
The dealership learned they would be receiving the award in March . Representatives from General Motors visited the dealership and held a lunch for all employees to present the awards .
Each customer who receives service or makes a purchase takes a survey and the dealership is scored based on those surveys , Everett said .
“ A satisfied customer is going to be a returning customer so that is important for our business to continue to grow , ” she added , saying that the dealership would seek to take care of its customers whether there was or was not a scoring system .
She said satisfied customers benefit both the dealership and themselves .
Getting both the Buick and GMC awards means the dealership is doing well in both brands , Everett said .
“ I think ( earning this award ) is important because it shows we consistently care , we consistently are working hard and are not straying away from who we are but are continually trying to grow , ” Everett said .
She added that “ there is something special about this dealership , ” which was the family 's first to purchase . She called it the “ anchor ” for the other businesses owned by the group .
She said this dealership has given them a greater ability to give back to the community because the more they sell , the more money General Motors gives them to spend on the community .
“ We have been blessed with a lot of good loyal customers that continue to do business with us for many years , ” Odom said , adding that both the customers and the way Everett Buick GMC does business is what allows the dealership to give back to the community .
“ To me it is a special dealership , ” Everett said . “ It is always busy . There is always something going on . ”
Other than the recognition , the feedback from the surveys also provides the dealership more information on what it is getting right and areas that need improvement to better serve customers moving forward .
“ It definitely gives us insight in what we need to continue to do , ” Odom said .
Everett said everyone at the dealership continually evaluates how to better serve customers .
“ I think Saline County is the heart of our success , ” Everett said .
She said with all three Saline County dealerships ( Everett Chevrolet and Everett Infiniti ) , they like to surprise the manufacturers with how well they do . She 'd like to see all three win Dealer of the Year awards .
Odom said the award reflects the hard work of the Everett employees and the dealership 's philosophy of treating people the way they want to be treated .
“ For Dwight ( Everett ) and I and our family , we hope our name represents integrity , honesty , loyalty and dependability , ” Everett said .
She added that the employees are part of that and seek to reach the same goals .
Odom said they appreciate the employees ' hard work and dedication to the customer .
“ We are blessed by a lot of loyal , good customers , good employees and good relationships with our customers , ” Everett said .

NEW DELHI : The number of emigration clearances granted to Indians headed to the Gulf forto 3.7 lakh in 2017 from 7.6 lakh in 2015.Moreover , there has also been a marked change in Indians ' preferred destination as far as Gulf countries are concerned . The United Arab Emirates ( UAE ) emerged as the top destination for Indian workers to West Asia , with nearly 1.5 lakh heading there to make some moolah , overtaking Saudi Arabia which saw just 78,000 Indians landing up there - a drop of 74 per cent from the 3.06 lakh Indians in 2015.The reason for a greater influx of Indian workers into the UAE is the relaxation of its migration policies for professionals . In contrast , countries like Oman have tightened the screws on immigration by extending their hiring freeze for another 6 months , till December-end , while Saudi Arabia lost its charm due to the imposition of the , wherein an expat worker has to pay a levy of Saudi Arabian Riyal 100 per month per dependent , which will double every year.While blue-collar Indian workers , such as labourers , carpenters , electricians , plumbers and drivers , dominated the labour scene in the Gulf Cooperation Council ( GCC ) till now , industry watchers say there is now a gradual shift , with more white-collar workers from India also showing interest in the Gulf.According to a , India continued to be the top recipient of remittances from overseas , which added up to $ 69 billion in 2017 , and roughly 56 % of it came from the GCC ( Gulf Cooperation Council ) countries Saudi Arabia , Kuwait , UAE , Qatar Bahrain and Oman .
LAHORE - Almost 90 per cent of Lahore plunged into darkness at 10pm owing to huge gap between electricity demand and supply in Lesco system , pushing the power distributor to conduct forced loadshedding in the metropolitan for hours .
The country is in the grip of history 's worst loadshedding since the start of April as the shortfall has hit more than 7,000MW . The electricity demand is crossing 18,000MW against the overall generation of less than 11,000MW from all hydel and thermal power plants .
The Lahore Electric Supply Company ( Lesco ) is facing shortfall of around 50 per cent and conducting average 14-hour shutdown in its urban and rural limits . The city consumers are facing up to 11-hour loadshedding with up to three-hour consecutive power cuts in some less privileged localities .
“ We are living in hell . We have never seen such blackouts in the start of summer , ” said Muhammad Ehsan , a resident of Ali Town , Raiwind Road .
“ Where is the government ? What about its claims to have done a lot to meet electricity needs ? ” he questioned .
Ehsan told The Nation his area is experiencing 12-hour loadshedding . “ The electricity supply is being cut at 9.15pm daily , followed by frequent disruption throughout the night . Our children can not sleep and they are unable to go to school . Moreover , we face severe shortage of water daily , ” he added angrily .
According to Lesco spokesperson , the company had to carry loadshedding on the directive of National Power Control Centre .
Another official said , seeking anonymity , the system will collapse if the power distribution companies do not abide by control centre directives . The NPCC monitored the burden of transmission system and gave direction for forced load shedding , he added .
The government has officially declared six to eight hours loadshedding in urban and rural areas of the country . But , officials say , the 10 power distribution companies conduct over 14-hour outages on daily basis with some areas of the country are virtually without electricity .
Lesco , on Monday night , shut down its 14 grid stations on the order of NPCC . The grid stations of Gulshan Ravi , Qartaba , Johar Town , Bhati Gate , Band Road , Chah Meeran , McLeod Road , Wallington Road , Cantt , Ravi Road , Iqbal Town , Multan Road and UET were shut down .
Moreover , more than 100 grid stations of Lesco , Gepco , and Fesco were repotedly closed over forced loadshedding , plunging half of the country into darkness .
LONDON : Twelve people were injured when a corrosive substance was sprayed inside a packed London nightclub , police and fire services said , amid a sharp rise in acid attacks in Britain 's capital .
Two of the victims , both men in their twenties , are in a `` serious but stable condition '' and 10 others suffered `` minor injuries '' , police said in a statement .
A London Fire Brigade spokesman told AFP an `` unknown corrosive substance '' was thrown in Mangle , a club in east London , in the early hours of Monday . It was identified as `` an acidic substance '' from testing , he said , adding that there were around 600 people in the club at the time . Police said the incident was not believed to be terrorism or gang related but the result of a dispute between two groups of people in the club . They said the fight led to `` a noxious substance being sprayed by a male suspect directly at Victims 1 and 2 '' - the two men with the more serious injuries .
`` Other people inside the venue suffered the effects of the substance , '' the statement said , adding that no arrests have been made and appealing for witnesses .
Police were called to the scene at around 0010 GMT . The streets around the club have been closed to traffic as the investigation continues .
London has seen a sharp rise in acid attacks in London in recent years .
There were more than 1,800 reports of attacks involving corrosive fluids in London since 2010 , according to police data cited by the BBC last month .
In 2016 , corrosive fluids were used in 454 crimes , compared to 261 in 2015 .
Some experts have suggested that criminal gangs may be switching from carrying knives to acid because it could lower the risk of prosecution .
In an acid attack in north London earlier this month , a 40-year-old father , 36-year-old mother and their three-year-old son were hurt .
The woman and child were later discharged from hospital but the man suffered `` life-changing injuries '' , police said .

John Smoltz , Greg Maddux and Tom Glavine baffled hitters through the 1990s , helping the Atlanta Braves to multiple division titles and a World Series championship.The Braves are returning to their strong pitching roots and Canadian Mike Soroka is at the forefront.The 19-year-old Soroka was promoted to double-A to start the 2017 season — a rarity for a player in his second full season as a pro . Atlanta director of player development Dave Trembley said the promotion was n't a hard decision. “ Mike 's going to be real special , ” Trembley said . “ He 's a guy that will take the ball every fifth day , he 's going to be a guy that 's going to give you a lot of innings . He prepares very well , he 's very mature , he knows what he wants. “ We have a lot of confidence in the direction he 's going and we see him as a front-line pitcher in Atlanta for a long time. ” Article Continued BelowThe Calgary native has n't disappointed since being promoted , going 7-3 with a 2.45 earned-run average in 12 starts with the Mississippi Braves . He also took a perfect game into the seventh inning of a May 12 start against the Mobile BayBears , retiring the first 19 batters he faced.The six-foot-five , 225-pound right-hander credits playing for the Canadian junior team with helping his transition to the pros after he was selected 28th overall in the 2015 MLB draft. “ I was fortunate to be able to hit the learning curve a little sooner than most high school pitchers , ” said Soroka . “ I kind of realized that everybody throws hard , everybody has good stuff , it 's about how you use it , not just what you have anymore . ”
The last participant to finish the 45th annual Honolulu Marathon did so at around 9:45 p.m. Sunday .
Ayako Hayashi is 81 years old and from Shiki-shi , Japan .
Her official time was 16 hours , 23 minutes , and nine seconds .
While she needed a little help getting to the finish line , Hayashi was all smiles as she received a much-deserved hero 's welcome at Kapiolani Park .
According to marathon officials , Hayashi was one of 32,340 participants who signed up to run in this year 's marathon .
Roughly 14,500 were from Japan , and 4,500 were from the U.S. mainland or international . The rest were local residents .
Our justice system was designed to protect citizens from an overzealous government . This it does rather well .
It is n't all that easy for a person to be convicted of a crime . One can get off on a myriad of technicalities or a whim of the sitting jury of his or her peers .
Much more likely is a guilty party set free . OK , they will act again and hopefully get caught for a second hearing , a third , and so on .
When someone is found guilty , our justice system becomes faulty . At this point , true justice changes its priorities . We need a system whose aim is to protect the public from crime and criminals .
Most of us would say a 6-year sentence for kidnapping , or probation for a brutal rape are insufficient to either get the perpetrators from our midst or deter the next person from the commission of a like crime . Like Springfield Mayor Domenic Sarno , I have been blaming the judges .
But their whole duty and perspective is to protect the accused , not us . What we need is a completely separate system to take over at the point of a decision of guilt , and let that system decide just how long or how badly we need protection .
Let that decision be made by those of us who are at risk . Justice is a two-way street . I 'm afraid the games played out in our courts just do n't have our best interests at heart .

General Motors is exploring a fuel cell vehicle platform with autonomous capabilities , the automaker announced today . In the future , the platform could underpin everything from commercial trucks , light- and medium-duty trucks , and military vehicles .
SURUS , short for Silent Utility Rover Universal Superstructure , features two electric drive units , a next-generation fuel cell system , and a lithium-ion battery . Its hydrogen storage system gives a compatible vehicle more than 400 miles of range . The platform uses truck chassis components and offers four-wheel steering for improved maneuverability . GM says the platform can be adapted for land , sea , and air applications . Given that it supports autonomous driving , the vehicle could reduce the amount of manpower needed in dangerous situations .
Why might fuel cells make good military vehicles ? GM says the quiet operation , lack of odor , instantaneous high torque , water generation , and low heat signature of the SURUS fuel cell system gives it an advantage over other types of vehicles . And this is n't the first time GM has worked on fuel cell technology for military applications . The Army is now running tests on the hydrogen-powered Chevrolet Colorado ZH2 , and so far , so good . Acoustic tests show the vehicle can get 10 times closer to its target without being detected compared to current military vehicles . Using technology from the Colorado ZH2 , GM has also provided a fuel cell system for an Unmanned Undersea Vehicle being tested by the Navy .
When it comes to more conventional vehicles , GM is making a big push toward electrification . By 2023 , GM will have introduced at least 20 new all-electric vehicles . Two of these will arrive within the next 18 months and will be based off knowledge GM gained from the Bolt .
Earlier this year , GM announced a joint venture with Honda to make next-gen fuel cell systems for future vehicles . These advanced fuel cell systems should go into production starting around 2020 .

LUSAKA ( Reuters ) - Zambia plans to drop treason charges against the country 's main opposition leader and free him from prison on Monday under a deal brokered by the Commonwealth secretary-general , government and legal sources told Reuters .
The United Party for National Development ( UPND ) leader Hakainde Hichilema and five others were arrested in April and charged with treason after Hichilema 's convoy failed to make way for President Edgar Lungu 's motorcade .
Hichilema 's trial had been due to begin on Monday but two sources said the prosecution would apply to the court to discontinue the case .
The case has stoked political tensions in Zambia , seen as one of Africa 's more stable and functional democracies , following a bruising election last year .
Commonwealth Secretary-General Patricia Scotland visited Zambia last week and told reporters she had met Lungu and Hichilema separately and that the two leaders had agreed to a process of dialogue facilitated by her office .
`` That process of dialogue , which the Commonwealth Secretary-General Baroness Patricia Scotland is leading with the help of Catholic bishops , starts with the release of the opposition leader from prison , '' a government source told Reuters on Sunday , referring to local religious leaders .
`` The state will discontinue the treason case in the public interest as both the opposition leader and the head of state are committed to burying their past and starting dialogue envisaged to help address some of the issues the opposition raised after the 2016 elections so that the 2021 elections are better held . ''
A spokesman for the UPND said the party was unaware of any plan to release Hichilema .
`` We do n't have anything on that . We are not privy to the agreement that was entered into between the two leaders and therefore can only wait for tomorrow , '' UPND spokesman Charles Kakoma said .
The government source said Lungu is committed to all aspects of the dialogue agreed between the president and the opposition leader , which include promoting peace , stability and public good .
`` An overt act serious enough to warrant prosecution exists but the public interest seems to be the overriding consideration , so a nolle prosequi will be entered , '' a public prosecutor told Reuters , using the legal term for the discharge of a case .
The southern African country has always been relatively stable but relations between the government and the opposition have been fraught since August when Lungu 's Patriotic Front ( PF ) beat the UPND in a presidential election marred by violence and which the opposition says was rigged .
It was the second time that Lungu beat Hichilema , an economist and businessman popularly known by his initials `` HH '' , in a presidential election by a razor-thin margin .
In June , church leaders including those from the influential Catholic church , called for Hichilema 's release .
Last month Lungu invoked emergency powers to deal with `` acts of sabotage '' by his political opponents , after fire gutted the country 's biggest market .
Under emergency laws , police can prohibit public meetings , detain suspects longer than usual , search without a warrant , close roads , impose curfews and restrict certain people 's movements .
The UPND has said Lungu 's use of emergency powers was unnecessary and was a ploy to make it easier for police to arrest its supporters .
On Thursday , police freed another opposition leader , United Progressive Party leader Saviour Chishimba , after holding him in detention for a week on accusations of defaming Lungu , an offence that carries a maximum five-year prison term .
Chishimba hit the headlines in July after criticizing Lungu 's decision to impose emergency powers and suggesting the president should go to hospital for mental tests .
When he invoked the emergency powers , Lungu said the measure would safeguard investments in the country , which is Africa 's second-biggest copper producer and is currently in talks with the International Monetary Fund over a financial aid package . The president said the IMF was free to terminate the negotiations if it considered his actions were wrong .
Do n't mess around with your eyes during the 2017 total solar eclipse . It 's not worth it to risk using the wrong type of glasses .
If there 's one thing I ca n't stress enough about preparing for the 2017 total solar eclipse , It 's that you should never ever look directly at the sun until it has reached 100 percent eclipse ( which will only happen within the path of totality ) . Even if the sky is dim , and it seems like you could look at it without harming your eyes , you 're wrong . You could suffer damage almost immediately .
The AAS says the following about viewing an eclipse :
The only safe way to look directly at the uneclipsed or partially eclipsed Sun is through special-purpose solar filters , such as `` eclipse glasses '' or handheld solar viewers . Homemade filters or ordinary sunglasses , even very dark ones , are not safe for looking at the Sun ; they transmit thousands of times too much sunlight .
When shopping for a pair of viewing glasses , make sure they are ISO certified to meet current eclipse filter guidelines . Do n't just buy a pair of shades that are called `` Eclipse Viewing Glasses . '' Even if the manufacturer claims the glasses are ISO certified , you should do just a little more research before making your purchase .
There are actually only a handful companies certified to manufacture eclipse-grade viewing filters in the U.S .. The American Astronomical Society ( AAS ) provides a list of trusted manufacturers that make ISO 12312-2 certified eclipse glasses and filters . I highly recommend checking this list when selecting your glasses . NASA does too .
Dave Mark at The Loop published an email he received from Amazon with a recall notice and advice that he should not use the glasses he purchased to view a solar eclipse . The reason ; The seller did n't confirm with Amazon that the filters were sourced from one of the recommended manufacturers .
The letter reads :
We 're writing to provide you with important safety information about the eclipse products you purchased on Amazon ( order # 113-5832038-7027461 for Daylight Sky G021 Plastic Solar Eclipse Glasses with Carry Case , Adult Size , Cool Style and Look , CE and ISO Tested , Safe Solar Viewing , ( 3 Glasses and 3 Cases ) , 3 Piece ) . To protect your eyes when viewing the sun or an eclipse , NASA and the American Astronomical Society ( AAS ) advise you to use solar eclipse glasses or other solar filters from recommended manufacturers . Viewing the sun or an eclipse using any other glasses or filters could result in loss of vision or permanent blindness . Amazon has not received confirmation from the supplier of your order that they sourced the item from a recommended manufacturer . We recommend that you DO NOT use this product to view the sun or the eclipse .
But , this advice should be taken across the board . Do n't ever use eclipse glasses that are n't specifically ISO certified and are made by one of the suggested manufacturers . There are businesses and organizations that will offer free eclipse-viewing glasses to people who attend special eclipse parties . Bring the list of manufacturers with you and double-check to make sure they meet the standards .
The International Organization for Standardization ( ISO ) notes that certified eclipse viewing glasses must meet the following criteria :
No more than 0.00032 percent of the sun 's light may be transmitted through the filters .
The filters must be free of any defects , such as scratches , bubbles and dents .
Handheld viewers must be large enough to cover both eyes .
Labels on the viewers ( or packaging ) must include the name of the manufacturer , instructions for safe use and warnings of the dangers of improper use .
Portland-based KGW reported that some of the glasses that Amazon has put on the recall list are actually from certified filter manufacturers on NASA and the AAS list of recommended manufacturers .
Two other U.S.-based Amazon solar eclipse glasses sellers contacted KGW following Amazon 's recall . Both said their products were verified as safe and manufactured by companies approved by NASA , but their glasses are still under a recall .
KGW says the owner of one solar eclipse glasses distributor said his glasses come from Thousand Oaks Optical and Baader Planetarium , both of which are on the recommended list . When asked about the confusion regarding sellers that claim their glasses are certified , an Amazon spokesperson told KGW `` Customers may have purchased counterfeit versions of legitimate products . ''
Your eyesight is nothing to take lightly , especially when it comes to looking directly at the sun . The easiest way to know for sure that you 're getting the right glasses is to check the list of trusted manufacturers from AAS and try to find eclipse viewing glasses at a brick-and-mortar store near you ( eclipse viewing glasses are skyrocketing in price online ) .

Rain water could cause the next red tide bloom
Experts are saying all this rain water is causing the first flush of the season where nutrient-rich fresh water is mixing in with the salt water of the Gulf .
This flush could cause the next red tide bloom to grow close to the mouth of the Caloosahatchee .
The possibility of red tide is n't something new to Southwest Florida beach goers .
“ You hear people getting sick from it , ” said Southwest Florida resident Jon Lough . “ The upper respiratory and infections , and all that , so we stay away from it . ”
Experts say that the recent rainfall helped break up the big bloom , but it could also cause the toxic algae levels rise back up .
“ The first flush of the season , that 's when most of the nutrients will come in , ” said Calusa Waterkeeper John Cassani . “ So , that 's when we 're worried most about now , that increase in nutrients that might magnify the effect of red tide . ”
All this rainfall is also adding to the possibility of increasing freshwater releases from Lake Okeechobee .
Lake Okeechobee 's levels are rising everyday , and the Army Corps may soon have to send more of that water to Southwest Florida .
“ We just came off of six months of way too dry , not enough freshwater , ” Cassani said . “ Now we have too much freshwater . ”
Cassani also says that the freshwater from the rain is throwing off the balance in saltwater , which could lead to more fish kills .

US Vice President Mike Pence met in a church in Cartagena , Colombia with Venezuelan families who have fled their country 's deadly crisis , as he wrapped up the first stop on a Latin American tour .
`` We will not stand by as Venezuela crumbles , but it 's important to note , as the president said , that a failed state in Venezuela threatens the security and prosperity of the hemisphere , '' Pence told reporters .
He told CNN in an interview that Venezuela risked becoming `` a greater problem for narcotics traffic '' and `` greater migration '' -- both of which he said directly threatened the security and economy of the US .
Pence later boarded his plane to fly to Argentina , the second stop on a tour that will also take him to Chile and Panama .
On Sunday , Pence stood by Trump 's threat , saying the US president `` says what he means and means what he says . ''
But he expressed hope a `` peaceable solution '' could be found on Venezuela .
Related reading Trump says US mulling 'military option ' on Venezuela Donald Trump describes Venezuela as a 'very dangerous mess ' as he reveals he is considering a military intervention against President Nicolas Maduro . Venezuela says Trump 's threat of military intervention is 'craziness ' Venezuelan Defence Minister Vladimir Padrino told state television that Donald Trump 's threat of military action against his country is an an act of craziness .
'Possible military option '
Trump on Friday said he was mulling a range of scenarios for crisis-hit Venezuela -- `` including a possible military option if necessary . ''
Caracas condemned the comment . On Monday , Venezuela Defense Minister General Vladimir Padrino called it `` crazy '' and showed America had `` dropped its mask '' in terms of wanting to attack his country .
The rest of Latin America -- even countries that condemn President Nicolas Maduro 's attacks on Venezuela 's democratic institutions -- have strongly rejected the threat .
China , which is owed billions in debt by Venezuela , also spoke out against foreign interference in other countries .
Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos had told Pence on arrival `` that the possibility of a military intervention should n't even be considered . ''
Many Latin American countries have bitter memories of past US adventures in the region . Those include invasions , gunboat diplomacy and the propping up of military dictators .
Washington has already imposed unilateral sanctions on Maduro and nearly two dozen of his officials .
The sanctions were in response to their establishment of a new loyalist body , an all-powerful Constituent Assembly , that supersedes the legislature controlled by the opposition .
No orders to Pentagon
Trump 's stated possibility of a US military operation looked likely to shadow Pence at every stop , eclipsing bilateral issues , especially trade , that he was raising along the way .
However the US defense officials at the Pentagon said on Monday they had not received any orders from the White House on a military option against Venezuela .
`` I ca n't speculate what that is because we have n't been asked to provide any options , '' Pentagon spokesman Colonel Rob Manning said .
Maduro 's regime has nevertheless seized on Trump 's threat as proof of its claim that the United States wants to topple the current leftist government to get its hands on Venezuela 's oil reserves , the largest in the world .
The Venezuelan opposition coalition on Sunday also rejected `` the use of force , or the threat of applying such force , by whatever country against Venezuela . ''
The coalition is seeking to oust Maduro through early elections .
Venezuela 's economy is heavily reliant on its oil exports . Shipments to the United States -- its biggest customer -- account for 40 percent of its crude production , but only eight percent of US oil imports .
The US sanctions so far have targeted individuals and not Venezuela 's oil industry , which would have consequences for US refineries .
Montreal police are calling a recent “ gang rape ” warning circulating on social media a fabrication . The SPVM took to Facebook to discredit the concerning message .
The fake post which uses the SPVM logo targets women by telling them to be wary of a young lost boy waiting to be brought home.The false warning continues by saying the boy is apart of a new ‘ gang rape ' scheme .
Montreal police claim to have no cases of this nature and no reported incidents .
The hoax has been shared on several social media platforms hundreds of times .
The police have taken efforts to squander the circulation of the hoax by sharing their post which disproves the information on their Twitter and Facebook page .

New Delhi : The Delhi High Court has sought to know whether the adjudicating authority under the new benami law has passed any order on Delhi Health Minister Satyendar Jain 's plea to cross-examine witnesses in connection with the alleged benami case against him .
Justice Rajiv Shakdher issued the direction on Jain 's plea seeking a stay on the proceedings before the adjudicating authority on the grounds that the Initiating Officer 's order to provisionally attach the assets allegedly belonging to him was passed without allowing him to cross-examine witnesses .
Advocate Amit Anand Tiwari , appearing for Jain , submitted he has not been given any opportunity of cross-examination of witnesses , whose statements have been blindly relied upon to arrive at the findings .
`` The entire proceedings before the adjudicating authority were illegal as various witness testimonies that have been recorded are not being provided to the petitioner . ''
`` It is trite law that fair hearing includes supply of all documents , whether they have been relied upon or not , at the time of final adjudication , '' the minister has said in his plea .
He contended that the `` denial of an opportunity to cross-examine the witnesses , on whose statements reliance has been placed , is contrary to all canons and principles of natural justice and fair play '' .
The counsel also claimed that his application before the adjudicating authority to cross-examine the witnesses has neither been allowed nor dismissed .
Opposing the minister 's contention , the counsel for the authorities said that once the adjudicating authority passes the order , the minister will have an opportunity to appeal against it .
However , the bench observed that `` how can it be that the adjudicating authority neither accepted the application for cross-examination of the witnesses , nor decided it '' .
`` Prima facie it seems to be very odd , '' the court said and fixed the matter for further hearing on 21 February .
According to Jain , the alleged benami transactions , from the proceeds of which the attached assets were claimed to have been purchased , took place between 2011 and 31 March , 2016 and hence , the amendment which came into effect in November 2016 would not apply .
His lawyers sought that either the proceedings under the Benami Transactions ( Prohibition ) Act be stayed or the adjudicating authority be directed not to pass a final order till his petition in the high court is finally decided .
Hundreds of bighas of land and other assets worth over Rs 30 crore , allegedly purchased in and around Delhi by four firms , have been provisionally attached by the department under the new benami law which carries a maximum punishment of up to seven years of rigorous jail term and a hefty penalty .
Under the Act , an Initiating Officer have been notified to conduct an inquiry or investigation regarding benami transactions .
The Initiating Officer will refer the case to the Adjudicating Authority which will examine all documents and evidence relating to the matter and then pass an order on whether or not to hold the property as benami .
The India-China War of 1962 forms the backdrop against which Kabir Khan 's latest film — Tubelight — plays out .
Salman Khan stars as a simple-minded man in what is being seen as a possible reprisal of his Bajrangi Bhaijan .
It also stars Sohail Khan and Chinese actress Zhu Zhu .
In a previous interview with Firstpost , Salman said of his role in Tubelight :
`` I am not smart at all ; I am a tubelight . When you are growing up , you are naive , innocent , but at the age of 51-52 , when you have seen the world , then it 's difficult to play something like this . I was wondering where should I get that innocence from , but this character allowed me to do everything . I had to dig deep into my childhood . Sohail and I started remembering all our school friends , our batch mates . Luckily , there are many kids in our family , and I learnt many things from them , but I had to be careful to not overdo things because it is an emotional film , and not a comedy . It could n't have looked like a caricature or a joke . It is a film on two brothers , where one goes to war and the other stays behind . ''
Now , in a new conversation with Vikram Thapa for Firstpost , Salman dwelt on one of the more difficult aspects of Tubelight — those intense war sequences . Salman talked about how war was a futile exercise , that true peace could only be reached at a discussion table , and that jawans were the ones who suffered most when wars were fought .
Here 's what Salman had to say .
The full interview will be out on Firstpost soon . Stay tuned .
Video shows car driving wrong way on US 41 in Punta Gorda
Charlotte County residents expressed their concerns Tuesday over potential dangers with one-way roads .
The Punta Gorda Police Department shared this video on Facebook showing an SUV driving toward oncoming traffic on a one-way road on U.S. 41 in Punta Gorda .
One Way Driver We have a lot of one-way roads in Punta Gorda ! Always remember to make sure you are driving in the right direction ! Luckily , no one got hurt in this incident ! Posted by Punta Gorda Police Department on Tuesday , April 24 , 2018
WINK News reporter Kristi Gross spoke with area residents . Watch the full segment above .
Emergency crews were called to reports of a stabbing in southeast Calgary on Wednesday night , according to police .
One person was taken to hospital in stable condition .
Police said it happened in the 2900-block of 17 Avenue S.E . at around 6:45 p.m .
Police continue to investigate and said no suspects were in custody .
No further details about the incident have been released . ​
Buck Farmer has produced two of the Tigers ' six quality starts over the past 20 games . ( Photo : Robin Buckson , Detroit News )
Detroit – The Tigers began the season with a rotation that featured an established ace , the reigning American League rookie of the year , two left-handers who made the 25-man roster out of spring for the first time and a veteran who missed most of the 2016 season with injuries .
Some inconsistency , therefore , was expected .
“ It 's just reality , ” catcher Alex Avila said . “ These are human beings , not robots . They are n't going to be perfect every time . It 's easy to say it 's difficult or frustrating . But it 's just the reality of the game and you 've got to roll with these punches and continue to work , continue to try and find that consistency .
“ That 's just the way it is . ”
Is it ever . Over the last four times through the five-man rotation ( 20 starts ) , the Tigers have produced just six quality starts , two of those by Buck Farmer , who replaced Matthew Boyd in the rotation .
In those 20 games , the Tigers ' starter has gone seven-plus innings three times , six-plus innings seven times , 5.2 innings once and five innings or fewer nine times . In that span , the Tigers are 2-5 in starts made by ace Justin Verlander and reigning rookie of the year Michael Fulmer .
Hard for a team to get any traction in that scenario .
“ I do n't really do much with it , ” manager Brad Ausmus said . “ You only have so many starters capable of pitching at the major-league level . We 've got to find a way to make it work . Whether it 's a glitch or this is who they are , we 've got to find a way to make it work . ”
The encouraging part of this is the talent and track record of the pitchers whom Ausmus sends out there every fifth day . Verlander , even with his recent struggles , is throwing with his usual high velocity ( 95-98 mph ) and his secondary pitches have for the most part been sharp . Other than his last two starts , Fulmer has been exceptional .
Daniel Norris and Jordan Zimmermann have both pitched better in recent starts . And Farmer , who gave up six runs in Tuesday 's loss , had pitched 13 straight scoreless innings .
“ You know every fifth day you got a guy who can potentially shut down a lineup , ” Avila said . “ It 's a matter of being able to put it together – locating pitches , being consistent with your delivery . It 's guys going through struggles being able to find that command , find that consistency in their delivery .
“ But it has made for some taxing days for the bullpen . ”
The Tigers rotation ranks near the bottom of just about every statistical category in the American League .
• 14th in opponents ' batting average ( .280 ) .
• 14th in WHIP ( 1.48 ) .
• 11th in ERA ( 4.65 ) .
• 2nd most hits allowed ( 397 ) .
• 3rd most earned runs allowed ( 185 ) .
• 4th most pitches thrown ( 6,142 ) .
“ On a daily basis , regardless of how that pitcher is performing , you are trying to make adjustments if you are pitching poorly , ” Avila said . “ You are trying to find a way back to what made you successful . This happens over the course of the year .
“ Unfortunately , when our bullpen was n't going so good , our starting rotation was better . Now it 's flip-flopped a little bit . But you just keep pitching , keep playing . ”
Only once in the last 20 games have Tigers starters spun quality starts in back-to-back games . When the Tigers won four straight games at the beginning of June , they did so with the help of just one quality start .
“ They have the track record , so you expect them to bounce back at some point and start producing quality starts , ” Avila said . “ It 's something you just have to be patient with . Verlander will be fine . Other than the last couple , Michael has been good . Daniel , he 's young and he 's still trying to figure out how to do it .
“ Sometimes it 's hard to be patient , but you have to be . ”

Northwood University 's softball team earned a pair of victory over Ashland University on Tuesday at Gerace Stadium in Midland .
The Timberwolves won the first game , 6-5 , on Karli Godlewski 's walk-off homer in the eighth inning . NU followed with a 9-6 victory in the nightcap to improve to 20-17 overall and 8-12 in the GLIAC .
Mackenzie Norton went the distance to earn the win in the first game , allowing 12 hits and striking out three .
Godlewski and Sydni Pauley each had three hits including a home run . Godlewski 's walk-off home was the first home run of her career . Torriya Gray-Baker also had three hits in the win .
Norton earned the win in the second game , as well , throwing 4 1/3 innings of relief . Pauley again had three hits , while adding a walk , two runs and two RBIs . Sydni Culps , Tara Gross and Meghan Franz each added two hits , with Gross scoring three runs and Culps driving in two .
Northwood hosts Ferris State in a doubleheader on Wedneday at 3:30 p.m .
Vin was waving to the crowd again . Newk was whipping one across the plate again .
The ageless Sandy Koufax was in the box seats , the new Sandy Koufax was on the mound , and the once-brilliant Dodgers were those Dodgers again .
Welcome back , summer . Welcome home , hardball .
On an early October night that appropriately felt like a warm July afternoon , the Dodgers began their long-awaited postseason Friday with a raucous , rollicking flashback .
Remember when everyone thought they could be the best team in baseball history ? Before everyone thought they were the worst team in baseball history ? Well , after a few hours of brilliant hitting , sturdy pitching and serious snake crushing , everyone can feel free to jump back on the belief wagon .
To be more precise , the Dodgers opened the first round of the playoffs by punching the Arizona Diamondbacks right between their wide eyes in a 9-5 victory in front of a full house at Dodger Stadium .
“ It was fun , '' said Cody Bellinger , and was it ever .
It was closer than it should have been , the Dodgers allowing a 7-1 lead to shrink to 7-4 after consecutive seventh-inning homers by Ketel Marte and Jeff Mathis against Clayton Kershaw , whose seventh-inning playoff ERA as a starter is now 25.50 . But the Dodgers countered with bullpen cleanup and Justin Turner 's fifth RBI , and all was well .
It 's only the first game of a best-of-five National League Division Series , but in the Dodgers ' last 15 postseason series , the outcome of the first game mirrored the outcome of the series .
The best images from Game 1 of the Dodgers ' National League division series with the Arizona Diamondbacks .
It 's only nine innings , but this thing felt finished after one , the Dodgers rolling rattled kid pitcher Taijuan Walker for four runs in the first before he recorded an out , the big hit being a Turner three-run homer into a partying mass of fans in the left-field pavilion .
“ It 's just nice to jump on him early , '' said Corey Seager of Walker . “ It 's nice to win Game 1 , get the momentum and move on from here . ''
It was only one night . But goodness , what a night , one that featured dancing fans , a flurry of waving blue towels , rattling cheers and Hollywood stars reading lines from their movies . When the video board showed Tom Hanks , he wagged his finger at the crowd and mouthed the words , “ No crying in baseball . ''
That is usually good advice for Dodgers fans in October , as the team has made 10 consecutive postseason appearances without a World Series championship , the longest such drought in history . But for once , those words were not needed .
All this , and Dodger fans throughout Los Angeles could actually watch them on television , the national networks taking over during the postseason for the mostly blacked-out SportsNet LA .
For those first-time viewers , that big guy making nifty plays at first base is Cody Bellinger , that little guy scoring two runs is Chris Taylor , and this is really how the team played for most of last summer .
The night began when Don Newcombe , the Dodgers ' 91-year-old legend who practiced throwing a sponge ball for two weeks in anticipation of this moment , delivered a perfect first pitch from in front of home plate to his protege Kenley Jansen .
The charm continued in the middle innings when the video board showed Vin Scully sitting in the crowd . He immediately stopped his conversation and stood and waved to a roaring crowd that has missed him terribly .
Dodgers fans have also missed this kind of baseball , the sort that pushed the team to a 52-9 stretch at one point during a regular season during which they were once on a pace to record the most wins in major-league history . Memories were quickly dimmed when , late in the season , this same team went 1-16 , a stat that 's scary because no club since 1900 has gone into such a nose dive and emerged as a World Series champion .
But these were the good Dodgers , right from the start , beginning a first inning that featured the same sort of offense that led them on this summer 's amazing streak . It helped that they were facing a very nervous Walker , a kid making his first postseason start after admitting he ca n't even stand watching these sorts of games .
Taylor led off by lashing a full-count single . Seager drew a full-count walk . Then Turner drove a two-strike home run into the left-field pavilion , shaking the packed stadium down to its studs .
Up next , Bellinger , who drove another two-strike pitch up the middle for a single . Yasiel Puig then scored him on a double to the center-field wall after a brilliant nine-pitch at-bat .
“ It was exciting to hear the crowd roar in the first inning , '' said Bellinger .
It was trademark 2017 Dodgers excellence . Grinding plate appearances , unselfish swings , working the pitcher , moving the line , wearing out arms and whittling away at resolve .
“ This is what we 've talked about from this offseason , wanting to bring that trophy back to L.A. to fans who have been waiting a long time for it . It 's the fifth year in a row for some of these guys , trying to do everything we can to make it happen , '' said Turner earlier this week . “ It 's about doing the little things . ”
Walker finished the inning and was then quickly pulled after allowing four runs on four hits in one 48-pitch inning in his his postseason debut . The Diamondbacks must now come back in Game 2 Saturday night with another pitcher with a bit of baggage .
Robbie Ray has stifled the Dodgers in his five starts against them this year with a 3-0 record , 2.27 ERA , 53 strikeouts and just 12 walks . But by taking the ball Saturday night against Rich Hill , he is essentially pitching on short rest , as he threw 34 pitches out of the bullpen in the Diamondbacks ' wild-card victory on Wednesday .
“ We made it here for a reason , '' said Ray . ” We 're not just limping our way in . ''
The Dodgers nearly had to limp their way out of Friday night , but survived , and Turner warned fans to get used to it .
“ No lead is safe in playoffs , no team going to roll over and quit , '' said Turner . “ It 's going to be an emotional ride of ups and downs . If we limit our downs and ride our highs as much as possible , we 've got a chance . ''
Finance Minister Arun Jaitley , while announcing the Union Budget on Thursday , put out some interesting economic ideas . I say ideas , because while some of these have been presented in the Budget as initiatives , they have n't yet taken the shape of programmes or schemes , nor is there funding for their immediate development . However , these ideas are interesting , represent fresh thinking , and all of them are possible pointers towards things to come . Here are five of them .
Firstly , the commitment to provide a minimum support price ( MSP ) at one-and-a-half times the cost of production for crops beginning with the Kharif sowing . This has to be seen in conjunction with the statement that if the market price of the agricultural produce is less than MSP , the `` government should purchase either at MSP or work in a manner to provide MSP for the farmers through some other mechanism '' .
The mechanism is yet to be worked out by NITI Aayog , and costs have n't been estimated , but a signal is there .
I see this as a pointer towards a scheme like the 'Bhavantar Bhugtan Yojana ' of the Government of Madhya Pradesh , wherein the administration commits to reimburse farmers for the differential between the MSP and the actual market price realised by them at the mandis .
While the jury is still out on the success of the scheme , it remains a bold departure from the past practice of extending price support to farmers through physical procurement of produce . Here , providing of MSP support by the government is delinked from the physical procurement of the produce , thereby eliminating many of the associated costs and issues arising from public procurement , storage and sale of such produce . If so , it would be an idea worth fleshing out .
The second idea of note , which was splashed prominently in the media , is that of the National Health Protection Scheme for providing medical expense coverage up to Rs 5 lakh per family for 10 crore families . Along with a slew of other initiatives in education and health , this idea acknowledges the importance of human development , and acts on research findings on the disproportionate adverse impact of medical expenses on the poor , and tries to address these issues in a grand way .
It 's more interesting because the Budget speech also mentioned in the same breath the ultimate goal of universal health coverage , suggesting perhaps that this would be the route to achieve that goal . Again , the scheme has yet to be formulated and funded , but this is something set in motion that will inevitably gather moss and be difficult to roll back even if there is a change in the political dispensation .
The third is the idea behind the raising of the turnover limit from Rs 50 crore to Rs 250 crore for companies to whom the reduced corporate tax rate of 25 percent would be applicable . In doing so , Jaitley claims to have covered 99 percent of the companies filing returns , and has thereby in essence — in terms of number of entities — almost fulfilled his assurance of bringing down the corporate tax rate from 30 percent to 25 percent over a period of time . It is another matter that pre-Budget corporate expectations were from the remaining 1 percent of companies who presumably pay the bulk of the tax collected .
I feel it is an interesting idea , because the roadmap has been set out , and we could expect in future years that this limit may rise even further , and without attracting political flak , as by definition , it is the not-so-large companies that are being benefited . It 's also a good idea because by raising the limit significantly , the government is not incentivising small and medium enterprises to stay small to avail of benefits , as most policies concerning this sector tend to do .
The fourth and fifth ideas are perhaps not yet even ideas , just mentions at this stage , but they do merit attention . There was a mention regarding the 20 schools of architecture that will be established on `` challenge mode '' . Presumably , this vague reference indicates that the project would be awarded on the 'Swiss Challenge ' method , in which any proposal by an interested party can be accepted as a project proposal and a bid , and thrown open to be `` challenged '' or matched by any other interested party . This method has been used for awarding a few infrastructure projects under public private partnership ( PPP ) by some states and also recently by the Indian Railways for redevelopment of railway stations .
In my view , this is an inherently unhealthy idea that seems to be gaining traction in the government , indicated by its inclusion in the Budget speech . Large project contracts should by default adopt established competitive bidding procedures ; Swiss Challenges are always open to the suspicion of gaming the system by providing an unfair advantage to the original proponent . There is no compelling reason for mentioning a contracting procedure in the announcement of setting up of the new schools — all one can say about it is that it is interesting .
The fifth idea , or rather just a mention , is of crypto-currencies and block chain technology . Sensibly , while holding that crypto-currencies are not legal , the underlying technology has not simultaneously been debunked . Block chain or distributed ledger technology has exciting potential applications , particularly in the financial services industry , and it is good that there is recognition of this potential and even a cautious willingness to `` explore use of block chain technology proactively '' . Though at this stage , it can be said to be no more than a thought publicly expressed , it does presage future applications in government , which is welcome .
We can expect these ideas to develop further and spark off changed ways of doing things in related sectors in the next few years . The pace of change may be faster or slower depending on the political dispensation , but the movement will be in the direction set out , and that will be a contribution of this Budget .

Francis Specker/CBSAdele ‘ s tribute to George Michael at Sunday night 's Grammys was both emotional and memorable : she stopped and re-started her performance of “ Fastlove ” because she wanted it to be perfect for her hero . But if the original concept for the tribute had happened , Adele would n't have been alone on that stage , and she would n't have been singing “ Fastlove . ”
According to Billboard , George 's manager originally wanted the tribute to include James Corden , Adele , Beyonce and Rihanna , each singing a verse from one of his songs — including “ Freedom ” and “ One More Try ” — as a mashup .
But Grammys Executive Producer Ken Ehrlich tells Billboard , it became obvious “ how passionate Adele was ” about the tribute , adding , “ She had a vision for what she wanted to do with it . ”
At the Grammys , Adele told reporters she was “ devastated ” when George died on Christmas Day . The next day , she says she told her partner Simon , “ I have to do that tribute. ” Even though his family did n't want a tribute at first , she explained , they then decided they wanted her , and only her , to do it .
According to Ehrlich , Adele and George 's attorney picked the images of the singer used during the tribute . She sang “ Fastlove ” because , she said , she 'd loved the song since she was 10 .
“ I heard the vulnerability in that song , especially in the [ part ] …where it goes from being about one-night stands and being a little bit sleazy to saying , ‘ In the absence of security/I made my way into the night ' and I lost my way , basically , ” she told reporters .
She then clarified , “ I did n't relate to that when I was 10…that 'd be weird ! ”
Even before the Grammys , Adele fans knew how much she admired George : a few years ago at her birthday party , she dressed in drag as him .

Mr. Acker Bilk – “ Stranger On The Shore ”
HIT # 1 : May 26 , 1962
STAYED AT # 1 : 1 week
These days , Kenny G 's whole public existence seems to be limited to TV commercials where he makes fun of himself . But those of us who are old enough remember when Kenny G was running shit . In the late '80s and early '90s , the smooth-jazz sax tootler was selling millions upon millions of albums , soundtracking way too many school-commute carpools , and generally imposing his will upon the world . Bill Clinton loved him . It did n't make much sense then , and it makes even less sense now . But in trying to figure out why so many inoffensively sleepy jazz instrumentals topped the charts in the early '60s , the Kenny G explanation is the best I can come up with . Plenty of people , after all , crave no excitement whatsoever in their music .
Mr. Acker Bilk , the British clarinetist behind “ Stranger On The Shore , ” was a pretty colorful character . He 'd learned to play his instrument while he was in the British Army , stationed in the Suez Canal . He 'd lost both his front teeth and half a finger in various childhood misadventures , and those injuries apparently informed his playing style . He fashioned a visual trademark for himself , wearing a bowler hat and a goatee . And “ Acker ” was n't his name ; that 's apparently slang for “ friend ” in Somerset , where he was from . ( He was also the first UK artist to top the Billboard charts in the Hot 100 era . So maybe the British Invasion starts here . )
But there 's not a lot of color in “ Stranger On The Shore. ” Bilk originally named the song “ Jenny , ” after his infant daughter , only changing the title when the British TV show of the same name wanted to use it for a theme song . “ Stranger On The Shore ” sounds like something you might play for an infant , possibly to induce sleep . It 's pretty and gentle , Bilk 's plummy clarinet floating above some slow-cresting strings . There 's no sense of immediacy or fire to it , but there 's a deep , warm comfort in the way Bilk plays . As far as jazz goes , it 's so fluffy and inoffensive that it really only barely qualifies . But it 's a whole lot better than Kenny G , anyway .

New Delhi : India will be hosting 81 matches across formats from 2019-2023 , 30 more than the current Future Tours Programme ( FTP ) , but the BCCI on Monday insisted that the number of playing days per year for the ever-busy cricketers will decrease .
The Future Tours Programme ( FTP ) was agreed in principle by the members at the BCCI Special General Meeting in New Delhi on Monday .
The next FTP cycle at home will include high-profile series against England , South Africa and Australia .
Another significant decision taken at the SGM was to host Afghanistan for a first ever Test match between the two teams . The dates of the historic Test will be chalked out later .
`` Afghans were scheduled to play their first Test in 2019 versus Australia but considering the historic relationship between India and Afghanistan , we decided to host their first Test , '' said BCCI acting secretary Amitabh Choudhary .
Among other decisions taken at the SGM , the suspension of Rajasthan Cricket Association ( RCA ) was revoked on the condition that former IPL boss Lalit Modi stays away from its functioning .
The BCCI also remained firm on its stance on dope testing of cricketers , saying there was no need for NADA to test the players as the board is WADA compliant .
Earlier this month , Christina Kishimoto assumed the position of Hawaii 's schools superintendent .
She says she wants Hawaii to be seen as the top public education system in the U.S. , and has a three-pronged approach to make that happen : Creating strong school designs , listening to student feedback , and getting teachers involved the process .
“ We are well on our way toward that goal . There are many great things happening at schools , ” she said . “ We have principals and teachers working in teams , creating great school designs and models that really engage students , and now we just have to make sure that every school is functioning at that level , supporting students at that level . So we 're going to work collaboratively as a system to make sure we deliver on that goal . ”
Kishimoto says she also plans to get the governor , legislators , and business and industry leaders involved .

Varanasi/Mirzapur : Terming the party 's social media volunteers `` cyber warriors '' , BJP chief Amit Shah on Wednesday asked them to spread like fire from Jammu and Kashmir to Kanyakumari to ensure the party 's victory in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections .
Shah , who was the chief guest at the BJP 's 'Social media volunteers meet of eastern UP ' held in Varanasi , said the volunteers need to use their creative minds to defeat opponents and give a befitting reply to those spreading lies against the party and Prime Minister Narendra Modi .
The BJP president was on a two-day visit to Uttar Pradesh to feel the pulse of the people ahead of the crucial 2019 Lok Sabha elections .
He asked volunteers to spread like fire from Jammu and Kashmir to Kanyakumari to ensure the BJP 's victory in the Lok Sabha elections scheduled next year . He said that there was no leader like Modi in the country whose reach was pan-India .
`` Does ( Andhra Pradesh CM ) Chandrababu ( Naidu ) or ( former PM ) Deve Gowda have a reach like Modiji ? Can people hear their speeches in Uttar Pradesh , '' he asked .
`` People reach in large number to hear Modiji whether it be Kerala , Jammu and Kashmir or anywhere across the country . He is loved and accepted by people , '' he said .
He also praised Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath , saying law and order had improved in the state and criminals had gone into hiding in neighbouring Delhi , where the situation had deteriorated .
Shah said under Modi 's leadership , India was globally respected and he also praised the Centre for carrying out surgical strikes against Pakistan , saying after America and Israel , India was the only country to take revenge through such a step .
The BJP leader also said , `` Some were pointing fingers at us but in the last four years not a single instance of corruption could be proved against us ... The Uttar Pradesh government had delivered a transparent and corruption-free governance . ''
He said during the last elections the party had expected a winning figure of 65 seats but the people gave a mandate of 73 seats .
`` Now , in the next year 's elections volunteers must ensure that we add one more seat and win 74 seats , '' Shah said .
Earlier in Mirzapur , he hailed the Centre 's decision to increase the minimum support price of kharif crop as `` historical '' , stating that the move would benefit the farming community in a major way .
He stressed that the Modi government was coming up with various farmer-friendly policy decisions ever since it came to power . A case in point , he said , black marketing of urea was checked by introducing neem-coated urea .
The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs ( CCEA ) at its meeting today approved the MSP of 14 Kharif ( summer-sown crops for the 2018-19 season . The decision , taken by the Union Cabinet headed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi , comes less than a year before next general election .
Shah also held closed-door meetings with party leaders to discuss the poll strategy in Mirzapur . Party leaders from Kashi , Avadh and Gorakhpur regions attended the meeting and shared their feedback with Shah . These three regions constitute 30 Lok Sabha seats and are crucial for the party 's scheme of things to ensure a repeat of its 2014 performance . The BJP-led NDA won 73 out of 80 seats in the state in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections .
The meeting was also attended by Adityanath , deputy chief minister Dinesh Sharma , BJP 's national general secretary Bhupendra Nath and state unit president Mahendra Nath Pandey . On Thursday he will leave for Agra . There the BJP president will meet party leaders from Kanpur , Bundelkhand , Braj and western Uttar Pradesh .

A HGV driver was fired after he ploughed his 44-tonne lorry 'recklessly ' down a pavement , just millimetres from residents ' doors .
Dave Close , 52 , claims he decided to check his CCTV after he felt his house 'shudder ' .
He discovered the shocking footage of the huge lorry travelling right by the front doors of the row of houses , missing them by inches .
The 52-year-old , from Howden , in East Riding of Yorkshire , says that if anyone had stepped out of their homes at the time they would have been killed instantly .
Dave claims that despite there being parked cars on the opposite side of the road , there was plenty of room for the lorry to pass without it ploughing down the pavement .

After the dad-of-two reported the incident to the haulage company the driver was immediately suspended and dismissed within seven days .
However Dave claims he has reported the road to the council numerous times over the years as it is routinely used by heavy goods vehicles wanting to access the M62 , which he believes it is too narrow for .
Dave said : `` I was at home when the lorry went past the house , I did n't just see it I could feel it , the buildings along the road shake whenever one drives past .
`` I noted the time and went to check my CCTV footage .
`` There was nothing coming up the other side of the road so there was no reason for the lorry to move over that far .
( Photo : Mercury Press and Media Ltd )
`` The streets are narrow , they have been here for over 300 years so were built for horses and carts , not for motor vehicles of this size .
`` My car was parked outside my house , on the road , there 's nothing illegal about me parking in a designated bay outside my home but it is illegal to drive on the kerb , especially at those speeds .
`` There is more than enough room for the lorry to move around my car without mounting the kerb . ''
The house in the video had previously belonged to Dave 's late Nana , and he claims he regularly contacted the council through fear that one day she could step out of her house and ultimately be hit by a lorry .
Dave said : `` I 've told them multiple times it 's a dangerous road .
`` Regardless of age or build no one would stand a chance against a 44 tonne HGV . ''

Dave who lives on Flatgate Road with his wife Vicki , 48 and children Megan , 18 , and Davey , 20 , says he has complained multiple times to the council but he believes they will do nothing about the issue .
Dave said : `` This is n't just a one-off incident , it 's not just the odd lorry that comes down here it is constant , I 've reported it to the council multiple times .
`` It feels like the council will do nothing about the road unless someone is ultimately hurt or there is an accident .
`` I just think that 's ridiculous , in my eyes that 's just too little too late .
`` We were promised a bypass a few years back during the build of a new housing estate but the council were told they did n't have to build one if they did n't want to , which of course they did n't .
( Photo : Google Maps/Mercury Press )
`` I 've lived on this road for 41 years and It 's always been like this .
`` The road is a residential street , it was built over 300 years ago for use by horses not 44 tonne heavy good vehicles .
`` We just need another road as a relief for the amount of traffic . ''
An East Riding of Yorkshire Council spokesperson said that a rerouting of the road away from Howden town centre and a proposed change to the parking layout will ease traffic flow and minimise the number of vehicles .
They also said that the parking bays allow enough room for HGVs to pass and that planning permission for a relief road was granted in 2014 but is still in its consultation phase .

The lorry featured the branding of Zootopia , though parent company the Hagen Group explained that it was a haulage company that they used and the driver had now been sacked .
A spokesperson for the Hagen Group said : `` While the vehicle is not owned by or directly associated with the Hagen Group , it is owned and run by a company that we know and therefore the video evidence we received in March 2017 was immediately passed to them for investigation .
`` The haulage company in question is a reputable one and treat this type of incident extremely seriously .
`` The driver in question was suspended immediately and was subsequently dismissed within seven days . ''

Are you looking for a vacation but also want to find a way to work in your love for the racing team that pulls at your tifosi heart strings ? We have a new destination for you . It 's in Spain , because that 's the home to the latest Ferrari Land theme park .
According to Motor1 , the Rosso Corsa-loving theme park has opened its doors for business . It 's located in Salou , which sits on the edge of the Balearic Sea . If you squint , you can probably see Mallorca in the distance . Suffice it to say , this is a rather beautiful part of our planet and now it 's also home to roller coasters and other rides all bearing that familiar prancing horse shield .
Ferrari Land is the second theme park built as a means to celebrate and honor the beloved brand . The first opened back in 2010 and is located in Abu Dhabi . There are plans for the third park to open in China and talk continues regarding a fourth park that could find a home in the United States .
These theme parks are n't owned or operated by Ferrari directly . Instead , each is operated by an investment firm that licenses all of the glorious Ferrari graphics and logos . It 's probably insanely costly to start this process , but the cash almost certainly starts flowing once the park opens . Just take a look at all the customers clad in a familiar red shade with an equally familiar equine graphic plastered on their chests . The merchandise shops in the park are practically guaranteed to do brisk business .
Beyond the merchandise , the rides sound interesting and fun . The main coaster can propel riders from 0 to 112 mph in just five seconds . There are also interactive rides that take park guests through the history of the brand to its roots in motorsports .
So , if you love Ferrari and are itching for a family getaway to the Spanish coast south of Barcelona , your next destination is a cinch .
Derek Carr is officially listed as questionable , which does n't rule him out from playing this week .
It was presumed that the Oakland Raiders quarterback would miss Sunday 's tilt versus the Baltimore Ravens when coach Jack Del Rio said his quarterback was dealing with a transverse process fracture in his back , an injury that generally comes with a two-to-six-week recovery period .
NFL Network Insider Ian Rapoport reported on Up To The Minute Live on Friday there is a small chance Carr could convince the team he can play .
`` At this point it is looking very good chance for him to be back next week , '' Rapoport said . `` [ It 's been ] described to me as a chance to play this week . I know he wants to play very badly . ''
[ Insert 'so you 're telling me there 's a chance ' joke here . ]
Carr was listed as limited in practice Thursday and Friday .
It would be a surprise if Carr plays with the back injury this week . However , the quarterback is going to argue his case to see the field after the Raiders lost back-to-back games .
More than likely we 'll see EJ Manuel under center against the Ravens , but we 've seen players push their way into a game with injuries in the past .
British police declared a `` major incident '' Wednesday after two people were exposed to an unknown substance in a town near where a former Russian spy and his daughter were poisoned with a nerve agent .
In a statement , the Wiltshire Police force says a man and a woman — both in their 40s — are in critical condition after being found in Amesbury , eight miles ( 13 kilometers ) from Salisbury , where Sergei and Yulia Skripal were poisoned on March 4 .
Police cordoned off places the two people visited before falling ill , but public health officials say there is not believed to be a wider risk . They were hospitalized Saturday and authorities at first believed they might have taken a contaminated batch of heroin or crack cocaine .
`` Further testing is now ongoing to establish the substance which led to these patients becoming ill and we are keeping an open mind as to the circumstances surrounding this incident , '' police said . `` At this stage it is not yet clear if a crime has been committed . ''
A major incident is a designation allowing British authorities to mobilize more than one emergency agency .
Britain accuses Russia of poisoning the Skripals with a Novichok nerve agent , a group of chemical weapons developed by the Soviet Union during the Cold War . Moscow denies the allegation . The poisoning sparked a Cold War-style diplomatic crisis between Russia and the West , including the expulsion of hundreds of diplomats from both sides .
Counter-terrorism teams from London 's Metropolitan Police were called in to help local forces in Wiltshire at the time of the Skripal poisoning . On Wednesday , however , Scotland Yard referred media calls to the Wiltshire police .
The statement from Wiltshire Police came only a month after police from 40 departments in England and Wales returned home after months of working on the Skripals ' poisoning . The Wiltshire Police force spent about 7.5 million pounds ( $ 10 million ) dealing with the aftermath of the Skripals ' poisoning and believe that his front door was contaminated with the nerve agent .
Sergei Skripal , 66 , is a former Russian intelligence officer who was convicted of spying for Britain before coming to the U.K. as part of a 2010 prisoner swap . He had been living quietly in Salisbury , a cathedral city located 90 miles ( 145 kilometers ) southwest of London , when he was struck down along with his 33-year-old daughter Yulia .
After being found unconscious in the street , the two spent weeks in critical condition at the hospital . Doctors who treated the Skripals said at the time said they expected them to die . They say they still do n't know what their long-term prognosis is .
The Skripals have been taken to an undisclosed location for their protection .
Police are looking for help to identify the suspects accused of damaging an office building . According to police , a group of males broke into the Fischer Office Building , 909 Main St. , on two separate occasions , Saturday , July 29 and Sunday , July 30 .
Police say the suspects allegedly caused nearly $ 900 in damage to windows and walls .
Police admit that the image quality is poor , but say there are some discernible physical characteristics and clothing traits that they hope will lead to an identification .
If you have any information , you should call police .
The Asus ZenFone Max Pro M1 was unveiled back in April as the company 's budget offering and managed to put up a tough fight against the king of the segment , the Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 Pro .
At launch , the ZenFone Max Pro M1 was announced in three RAM and storage variants — 3 GB RAM with 32 GB storage , 4 GB RAM with 64 GB storage and a 6 GB RAM variant with 64 GB of storage . While the 3 GB RAM and 4 GB RAM variants went on sale on 3 May on Flipkart , the 6 GB RAM variant was still being awaited .
Launching its flagship smartphone , the ZenFone 5Z in India today , Leon Hu , the Country Head of Asus finally revealed that the 6 GB RAM variant of the ZenFone Max Pro M1 will go on sale later this month on Flipkart . Priced at Rs 14,999 , the variant will be Rs 2,000 cheaper than its 6 GB Redmi Note 5 Pro counterpart .
The announcement does not come across as surprising , however , as the variant was accidentally revealed by Asus ' retail partner Flipkart recently , hinting that it was on the way .
As far as specifications go , the phone is powered by the Snapdragon 636 SoC under the hood , which includes an Adreno 509 GPU . In the camera department , the phone has a dual-camera setup featuring a 13 MP sensor and a 5 MP one . The front camera is an 8 MP unit . The camera which was a tab disappointing when we reviewed the smartphone back in May also received an OTA update recently which brings with it a host of improvements to the quality of images , as well as , the camera interface which we strongly disliked initially .
Asus also throws in a massive 5,000 mAh battery into the phone and a lighter Android One-inspired user interface . You also get the latest version of Android Oreo 8.1 running on the phone , so there is very little to complain about with the phone .

A party is just a party — until it 's far more than that .
The Museum of Contemporary Art recently mailed May 12 “ save the date ” invitations to its 2018 gala honoring one of its artist board members , Mark Grotjahn .
But Grotjahn , who agreed to be honored last year , has since declined to accept the award . His reason : a lack of diversity in the museum 's recent gala honorees , who have been straight , white men — Jeff Koons last year and before that , Ed Ruscha and John Baldessari .
The Grotjahn news lands at the same time that artist Lari Pittman , who is gay and Latino , confirmed to The Times that he resigned his seat on the MOCA board about two weeks ago .
Grotjahn did n't respond to requests for an interview , but The Times did obtain text from a statement he sent about three weeks ago to board co-chair Maurice Marciano that read :
“ Since the day you extended your invitation to me , our country and the world have changed in ways that were difficult to anticipate.There is a new urgency to change the power dynamic and we have an opportunity to do so . ''
MOCA 's `` save the date '' card . Los Angeles Times
MOCA Director Philippe Vergne said he had discussed this year 's honoree and the idea of diversity with Marciano and board co-chair Lilly Tartikoff Karatz , but that ultimately the decision to honor Grotjahn was theirs . Vergne said Grotjahn was “ totally worthy of being the honoree , ” but he respected the artist 's decision to decline .
“ My response to him was : ‘ We decided to honor you before and it 's our duty and pleasure , now , to honor your ideas , ' ” Vergne said .
“ I remember our first conversation , and Mark said the reason he accepted was because it would give him an opportunity to step up to the podium , in front of all these people — philanthropists , other artists — and talk about MOCA and how important it has been for his generation of artists and other generations of artists , ” Vergne said . “ It was out of pure love . He wanted to help MOCA . Then he realized maybe the best way to help MOCA , today , is to invite a conversation that would promote a different model for the gala , so that the gala could better reflect what 's happening in the world — and in the program at MOCA . ”
MOCA said it is rethinking its gala and will send out a new announcement in the next few weeks .
Like most museums , MOCA stages the gala as its biggest fundraiser of the year . With the goal of selling tickets — which at MOCA start at $ 2,500 for individuals and run to $ 100,000 for a table — museums typically choose big-name honorees to fill seats . LACMA 's 2017 Art + Film Gala honored George Lucas and Mark Bradford . The Hammer Museum 's 2017 Gala in the Garden honored Ava DuVernay and Hilton Als . The first official MOCA gala was in 2001 , but the honoring of individual artists did n't begin as an annual practice until 2015 , with Baldessari .

Pittman said he respects Grotjahn 's work , but felt the board was not casting a wide enough net for honorees . Years ago he sent an email to Vergne listing about 15 possible honorees , including Betye Saar and Kerry James Marshall , but Pittman was dismissed , he said , adding that he otherwise has good communication with Vergne .
Pittman said he and other board members were n't consulted about this year 's gala . He learned of the decision to honor Grotjahn when he received his “ save the date ” card .
“ What my resignation implies is an individual and personal vote of no confidence in the relationship between the board and the director and the director and the board , between the board and the curatorial team and between the directorship and the curatorial [ team ] — in other words , it 's in every direction , ” Pittman said . “ It 's a vision problem in what the board wants , what the director wants and what the curatorial team wants . Their visions are very different . I 'm leaving because I do n't see any current resolution given all the players . ”
For Pittman , institutional inclusivity is a deeply personal issue .
“ I 'm 66 , and when I came out of the closet in '71 it was n't easy , ” Pittman said . “ And I 'm Latino — my first language is Spanish . It gives you a perspective in life . I 've gotten some privilege in the art world , and rewards , and that 's been wonderful . But that perspective — of lack of inclusiveness , of not casting a big enough net — never leaves . ”

My response to him was : ‘ We decided to honor you before and it 's our duty and pleasure , now , to honor your ideas . ' MOCA Director Philippe Vergne , on his message to artist Mark Grotjahn
Vergne said Pittman 's decision to step down from the board was “ painful . ”
“ But I also fully respect it in the same way I respect Mark Grotjahn for the decision he 's made , ” Vergne said . “ They 're actions being taken because they 're artists who want to see changes made in the world and in the institutions that they love . ”
MOCA 's exhibitions have included 2017 solo shows for African American artist Marshall and for Latina artist Anna Maria Maiolino . “ Axis Mundo : Queer Networks in Chicano Art ” showed at MOCA 's Pacific Design Center satellite last year , and the main Grand Avenue location has installed a new mural by Nigerian-born Njideka Akunyili Crosby . This spring it will exhibit an installation commission by Lauren Halsey , a black artist from L.A .
The programming has been well received : Attendance jumped about 21 % from 2016 to 2017 , the museum said .
“ The curators here have brought to this program a sense of inclusiveness and diversity that I think is really radical , ” Vergne said . “ And for me , it 's important that these programming decisions are reflected in our gala . ”
In 2012 artists Catherine Opie , Barbara Kruger , Baldessari and Ruscha all resigned from the board protesting the vision of then-director Jeffrey Deitch . In 2014 , after Vergne was named director , all of the departed artists but Ruscha rejoined the museum 's board . Later that year , Bradford and Grotjahn joined the board , and Pittman joined in 2015 .
MOCA is planning a retrospective of Grotjahn 's work for 2020 .

If you received a chocolate bunny in your Easter basket , what part of the bunnys anatomy did you attack first ? If you began with his ( or her ? ) ears , you fall into the category that 59 percent of people who eat chocolate rabbits , begin the ritual of enjoying the calorie-laden chocolate confection , by nibbling at its ears .
Kathleen Yarmechuk , an otolaryngologist at the Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit , conducted a tongue-in-cheek research study titled Seasonality of Auricular Amputation in Rabbits ,  and found that in addition to those who do away with the ears first , 4 percent of the people surveyed chose the toes to begin with and a third of the 28,113 online subjects studied had no starting-point preference when it comes to candy-bunny binging ( The New York Daily News , April 4 , 2017 ) .
To those who asked about the iPad password and instructions that I had put in a safe and secure place and then forgot they were , I am happy and relieved to say that the lost has been found . It wasnt really Saint Anthony who found them ; I just happened upon them when I was looking for something else . I think thats called serendipity. I made a copy of the information that Ill need and hid that in another safe and secure place .
In any event , a week after a friend comes home from an extended stay with a sick relative , well begin my lessons in earnest . Friend promised that she wont end our sessions until I have a real understanding of the ins and outs of the instrument .

With that kind of commitment , I shouldnt do what another friend did when she was introduced to the twenty-first century with an I-pad from her children . She was given some fast-paced instructions by her grandsons ; however , after two weeks of tutoring , and frustration on her part , she decided that the boys talked too fast and seemed impatient with someone of a certain age . Technology , she decided , was not her cup of tea so she gave back the gift . I dont know if her children gave her a replacement . I can hear them saying , At least we tried.
While reading and surfing ( on the computer , not on a board off a beach in California ) , I found in a Parade magazine an article about the Martin Luther King Jr. Monument Park which was dedicated yesterday . The date , in 2017 , commemorates the 73rd anniversary of a speech that the Reverend King gave , when he was just 15 years old , at the First African Baptist Church in Dublin , Georgia . The speech , which he himself wrote , was entitled The Negro and the Constitution. This was followed , as many of us know , by letters from prison and , perhaps most notably , his speech , I have a Dream.
The second half of April is replete with activities such as the universitys end-of-the- year awards luncheons and banquets , preparation for final exams , events that recognize retirements of faculty and staff , et cetera . Two other dates of possible interest are April 22 and 23 . The former celebrates Earth Day ,  the latter is the date on which William Shakespeare was born and the date on which he died ; the latter is the birthdate , in 1928 , of the late Shirley Temple Black  actress , businesswoman , and diplomat . Those of a certain age have fond memories of Curly Top ,  The Little Colonel ,  Bright Eyes ,  and other of her films .
Now that weve finished off the chocolate bunnys ears or toes , we should make a good Earth Day on Saturday for a friend or neighbor . We might rake up backyard dead leaves , plant zinnias or morning glories , or help a friend clean his garage . That would serve to make a good day for someone , to get exercise , and/or to help someone clean their garage as we haul the debris to the recycling center .
Much will have been accomplished ; many will have been served .

The State of Junagardh is another miserable tale of the partition of the Sub-continent .
Pakistan could not win over Kashmir .
It lost Hyderabad , Junagardh , and Manavadar , located in the Kathiawar Peninsula of Gujarat , and parts in the Punjab because of the political hypocrisy of the Congress establishment and the high-handedness of the Viceroy Lord Mountbatten .
India was enlarged and Pakistan was shrunk by him .
These were tactical moves and not the principles of partition .
In fact , India and Pakistan were largely not partitioned under the Indian Independence Act passed by the British Parliament on 18 July 1947 as mentioned in the 3 June 1947 Plan but divided by Mountbatten .
The present map of the Sub-continent was drawn by him and was not authorised by the British Parliament to seek peoples ' mandate and the wishes of the rulers of as many as 552 princely states at the time of partition .
Pakistan fully committed to its Kashmir policy as a territorial , political , diplomatic , and humanistic dispute with India .
There is no iota of doubt that India militarily took over part of the State of Jammu and Kashmir in 1948 by promising , in the UN Security Council , to solve the issue by a people 's mandate , which was never fulfilled until to date .
The diplomatic and political battles continued between the two countries over ascertaining the legal status of the Jammu and Kashmir State .
As a result of India 's hypocrisy of promising a solution through the UN intervention , Pakistan militarily lost the part of the State of Jammu and Kashmir .
It was a tactical military lost .
The issue of the State of Jammu and Kashmir was not the only case Pakistan militarily lost to India ; there were three other princely states whose case was also militarily lost by Pakistan .
These were the States of Hyderabad , Junagardh , and Manavadar .
All of these princely states legally acceded to Pakistan but India occupied them through naked military aggression against the wills of the Nizam of Hyderabad , Nawab of Junagardh , and the Khan Sahib Ghulam Moinuddin Khanji , rulers of these states .
Interestingly , the Junagardh completed the whole political process of accession to Pakistan .
Pakistani leadership approved this process .
The Nawab of Junagardh Muhammad Mahabat Khanji III , signed the instrument of accession with Pakistan on 15 September 1947 and Pakistani flag was raised in the State of Junagardh against the advice of Mountbatten .
The Nawab exercised his free will .
Following disturbances engineered by India , he flew to Karachi on 25 October 1947 and established the Provincial Government of State of Junagardh there .
The Constituent Assembly of Pakistan endorsed the instrument of accession .
The State Council of Junagardh endorsed the accession of the Nawab .
The affairs of defence , communications , and foreign policy were entrusted upon the Government of Pakistan .
What else the Nawab of Junagardh should have done ? We must ask ourselves as a nation .
The lost of Junagardh was a setback to the Pakistan movement .
Sir Shah Nawaz Bhutto , father of Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto , who was the Dewan ( Chief Minister ) of Junagardh , told visiting V .
P .
Menon , envoy of Mountbatten , that the accession was final according to international law and now only Pakistan Government was responsible to look after the affairs of Junagardh .
When India started military action in the State of Junagardh , Bhutto asked Pakistan for all sort of help against Indian intervention .
The Indian Air Force bombed the State of Junagardh along with tanks and military vehicles and took over it on 9 November 1947 .
Prime Minister Liaquat Ali Khan accused India of violence as at that point that Junagardh was a territory of Pakistan and India was not authorised to intervene there .
He stated that the Indian action was a breach of international law .
Junagardh was virtually a Pakistani territory for 56 days from 15 September through to 9 November 1947 but Pakistan could not militarily secure it .
There was no military action from the Pakistani side .
After illegal military occupation , India insisted on the so-called plebiscite because of the presence of the large Hindu-population but denied the same for Jammu and Kashmir .
Indian tactics worked out in all princely states and Pakistan overpowered by India .
For both these princely states , Pakistan diplomatically lost the case in the United Nations .
This has justified India illegal and military action in both these princely states .
The case also reinforced India 's occupation of the Jammu and Kashmir State .
These were the richest princely states in the British Indian empire , hailing like today 's Scandinavian states .
With an important port of Veraval and maritime location , the princely state of Junagardh was a trading hub for the rest of India .
These states could have swiftly revived the economy of Pakistan , which had confronted a number of financial problems at the time of independence .
According to the incumbent Nawab of Junagardh , Jahangir Khanji , the instrument of accession to Pakistan is still valid and Pakistan must follow a proactive international diplomacy in the United Nations and in other fora to regain its right of possession of the State of Junagardh .
The case of Junagardh is still pending in the United Nations .
It needs to be revived .
The Government of Pakistan should establish the Junagardh House in Islamabad to continuously raise the voice for its independence from India and accession to Pakistan as signed by the Nawab of Junagardh in 1947 .
Historically , the military and diplomatic response by Pakistan to the wishes of rulers of these princely states posed several questions that were never answered .
Why could n't Pakistan militarily occupy the territories of the princely states of Hyderabad and Junagardh when these states legally acceded to it ? Why did Pakistan lose the diplomatic battle in the United Nations for acquiring these states ? These are crucial questions and Pakistani leadership and Foreign Office must find out answers to them .
What made them silent and adopt a lukewarm and tepid response to these vital issues of Pakistan existence on which the very foundation of the state was laid down ?

Talented students put their creativity to the test creating outdoor play equipment for youngsters .
A group of East Durham College students were bursting with pride when they handed over their handmade wooden play equipment , including a boat , car and bike , to the children at Shotton Hall Primary School in Peterlee .
Students from Houghall College who worked on the play equipment .
The nine students , who are studying on a level two employability skills programme at the college 's Houghall campus in Durham city , needed to work on a community project as part of their studies .
The project was set up thanks to a link between Shotton Hall Primary and their lecturer , John Murray .
John said : “ Outdoor play equipment is very expensive , so the school approached us to see if we could help with some equipment for their early years outdoor play area .
“ The group had to work on all elements of the project from planning , preparation , construction to the handover . They hand-built all the items at Houghall and completed the whole project in about 3 weeks .
“ They all worked extremely hard on the project and should be extremely proud of what they have achieved , I know I am . ”
Students Chloe Brown , 17 , Courtney Kennedy , 17 , Dale Hanley , 18 , Ellis McKinnie , 22 , and Ryan Marshall , 19 , all travelled to Peterlee to hand over the wooden items they had built and were choked by the reaction of the children .

WASHINGTON - Max Scherzer will start Game 3 of the NLDS for the Washington Nationals .
Manager Dusty Baker made the announcement prior to Friday 's opener against the Chicago Cubs . He also confirmed that lefty Gio Gonzalez will start Game 2 on Saturday .
`` We 're going to go Gio tomorrow , '' said Baker , `` and then Max will go -- slated to go Game 3 . ''
Scherzer , who is Washington 's ace and the reigning NL Cy Young winner , exited his final regular season start on September 30 after suffering what he called a `` small tweak '' in his right hamstring . Originally expected to be the Nats ' Game 1 starter for the second year in a row , the injury forced Baker to reconfigure his rotation , which now features Stephen Strasburg taking the mound against Chicago in the opener .

On Friday afternoon , while Baker held his pregame press conference , Scherzer threw his first bullpen session since injuring his hamstring .
`` We 'll see how he comes out , '' said Baker .
This season , Scherzer went 16-6 with a 2.51 ERA in 31 starts , his lowest total since 2010 . In August , he missed two weeks with a neck injury , and in his second start back from the disabled list on September 2 , he was struck in the calf by a line drive . Considered a leading candidate to win his third Cy Young award , Scherzer led the National League in strikeouts ( 263 ) and WHIP ( 0.90 ) , while helping Washington to its fourth division title in six seasons .
Washington : US president Donald Trump has threatened to end foreign aid to countries that do not prevent illegal drugs from reaching the US .
`` I want to stop the aid . If they ca n't stop drugs from coming in , 'cause they can stop them a lot easier than us , '' he said on Friday during a visit to the US Customs and Border Protection ( CBP ) National Training Center in northern Virginia , Efe news reported .
`` They say , 'oh we ca n't control it . ' Oh great , we 're supposed to control it , '' Trump said . `` So we give them billions and billions of dollars , and they do n't do what they 're supposed to be doing , and they know that . But we 're going to take a very harsh action . ''
The president did not mention any countries by name in regard to the drug issue , though he previously pointed to El Salvador , Guatemala , Honduras and Mexico as sources of illegal immigrants .
`` These countries are not our friends , you know , '' he said , though it was not entirely clear which nations he was talking about .
`` We think they 're our friends , and we send them massive aid , and I wo n't mention names right now . But I look at these countries , I look at the numbers we send them , we send them massive aid and they 're pouring drugs into our country and they 're laughing at us , '' Trump said .
In a discussion with CBP officials , the president asked about the origin of cocaine , heroin and methamphetamines that reach the US and the routes used by traffickers .
This just happened , and is reported briefly by many venues , including NBC News .
An explosion occurred during the Monday morning rush hour near New York City 's Port Authority , police said .
One suspect is in custody following the incident at 42nd Street and Eighth Avenue , a senior NYPD official said .
The suspect sustained a minor injury but it was not immediately clear if anyone else was wounded , police said .
Emergency vehicles rushed to the scene , causing major evacuations in the massive transit hub .
The Fire Department of New York City said they received a call about the explosion at 7:19 a.m . ET .
The Port Authority Bus Terminal is the nation 's largest bus terminal and about 230,000 passengers pass through it on a weekday , its website says .
President Donald Trump was briefed on the incident , White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders said .
OKARA-Hundreds of employees of the Livestock Department and other departments observed complete strike and held a rally from the District Livestock Office to the Okara Press Club for regularization of the contractual staff .
The hundreds of employees across wearing arm bandages took out the protest rally and chanted slogans demanding regularisation of the contractual employees of the Supports Services Livestock Farmers ( SSLF ) and their service structure at the earliest . It was also demanded that the risk allowance already sanctioned in 2015 be given to the employees .
The workers ' leaders delivered speeches in front of OPC and later dispersed peace fully . The hundreds of employees of the civil veterinary dispensary ( CVD ) of the union council also participated in the rally and observed strike .
The Aam Aadmi Party ( AAP ) was kept out of the discussions to identify a presidential candidate on Wednesday after the Congress and Nationalist Congress Party struck down a proposal for the same , reports Times of India . The proposal to include AAP had been moved by CPM general secretary Sitaram Yechury and Trinamool Congress chief Mamata Banerjee in the last meeting in May attended by 17 opposition parties . It was shot down in Wednesday 's meeting by NCP chief Sharad Pawar and Congress ' Ghulam Nabi Azad , who cited the objectionable conduct of some AAP members as the reason for keeping them out of the discussions .
The report further said that senior JD ( U ) leader Sharad Yadav had also said that AAP members had been disrespectful of opposition leaders . Some of the participants had suggested that AAP would want to support the opposition candidate in order to avoid supporting the BJP , as it had troubled relations with the ruling government over the administration of Delhi .
Amar Ujala quoted Azad as saying that AAP leaders had not behaved appropriately . Other Congress leaders called AAP a branch of the RSS and the B-team of the BJP . They further said that the party had caused enough trouble in Goa , Punjab and Gujarat .
The opposition parties had met in the Parliament chamber of the Leader of Opposition in Rajya Sabha , Ghulam Nabi Azad . The leaders including Azad and Mallikarjun Kharge from the Congress , JD-U 's Sharad Yadav , RJD 's Lalu Prasad , CPI-M 's Sitaram Yechury and NCP 's Praful Patel . Derek O'Brien of the TMC , RS Bharathi of the DMK , Ram Gopal Yadav of the SP and Satish Chandra Misra from the BSP were also present .
`` The nitty gritty details were not discussed . No names have been short-listed yet , '' Azad said after the 30-minute meeting .
The nominations for the presidential election were opened by the issuance of a notification by the Election Commission on 14 June . The elections themselves will be held on 17 July .
Six candidates filed their nominations on the first day . They include K Padmarajan from Salem in Tamil Nadu , Anand Singh Kushwaha from Gwalior in Madhya Pradesh , A. Bala Raj from Mahbubnagar in Telangana , Saira Bano Patel from Mumbai , Abdul Hamid Patel from Mumbai , and Kondekar Vijayprakash from Pune in Maharashtra .
The BJP , on Wednesday , stepped up its efforts to get maximum support for its presidential candidate with the three-member party panel speaking to a number of allies as well as opposition parties , amid indication that its nominee will file nomination next week . They ruled out filing of nomination by its candidate this week as the consultation process will take more time with Union ministers Rajnath Singh and M Venkaiah Naidu , two members of the BJP panel , scheduled to meet Congress chief Sonia Gandhi on Friday as they work to evolve a consensus .
They are likely to meet Sitaram Yechury of the CPI ( M ) following the meeting with Gandhi .

Police confirm they were called to the Elgin-Middlesex Detention Centre ( EMDC ) on Saturday to help investigate the death of an inmate .
Const . Sandasha Bough says police are assisting the coroner but no details were provided about the victim .
Saturday 's death is the latest in a string of deaths and injuries among inmates at the jail .
Most recently , an inmate was pronounced dead at the jail in mid-August . While police provided few details , the incident prompted a response from Progressive Conservative MPP for Elgin-Middlesex-London Jeff Yurek , who is calling on the government to expedite the delivery of a body scanner and allow correctional officers to carry the drug naloxone , which counteracts the effects of opioids like fentanyl and oxycodone .

In mid-October , one of the men accused in the death of Raymond Beaver was transferred out of EMDC after appearing in court via video with two black eyes .
Earlier that same month , 32-year-old Anthony George was sentenced for the beating death of his cellmate , Adam Kargus . The 29-year-old Sarnia man was just two weeks into his sentence when he was beaten to death in his cell on Oct. 31 , 2013 .
Six inmates have filed a lawsuit against the province in the wake of the beating death , claiming they 're suffering lasting psychological trauma after being forced to witness a murder while locked in their cells .
A joint coroner 's inquest into the deaths of inmates was announced in August . Floyd Deleary , 39 , died Aug. 23 , 2015 while Justin Thompson , 27 , died Oct. 31 , 2016 . Both died in hospital after being transferred from EMDC but few other details have been released .

Out-going U.S. Ag Secretary Tom Vilsack has some suggestions for farmers and others who will lobby congress about items in the next Farm Bill .
“ We faced a very difficult challenge with the recent Farm Bill because the conversation started something like this : ‘ We 've got to save $ 23 billion , ' ” Vilsack says . “ That was the first thing out of the box . The powers that be decided that saving money was the most important aspect of the Farm Bill . ”
Vilsack says , as a result , corn and soybean farmers from the Midwest were “ pitted against ” southern farmers who raise cotton and produce sugar as the 2014 Farm Bill was written . Vilsack is urging groups in the farm sector to be more vocal advocates of federal crop insurance subsidies and other USDA programs that provide grants for rural development . Key members of congress say negotiations on the 2018 Farm Bill could begin later THIS month .
“ So it 's going to be incredibly important for us to start the conversation with : ‘ What is the need in rural America ? ' because rural America is an important place . It 's where we get our food . It impacts our water . It 's our feed stock for our energy sources . It 's where we recreate . It 's our military families and , oh yeah , it gives everybody else in the country the ability to do something other than farming because we 're tremendously productive , ” Vilsack says . “ It 's an important place . It deserves to have a conversation , first and foremost , as to what the need is . ”
Vilsack , the former Iowa governor , has been the nation 's top ag official for the past eight years . In 1889 , Grover Cleveland was the first president to include an agriculture secretary in his cabinet . There have been 30 ag secretaries since then , five of whom came from Iowa . “ Tama Jim ” Wilson served three presidents , from 1898 to 1913 . Edwin Meredith , founder of the Des Moines-based Meredith publishing company , served a year in President Wilson 's cabinet . Henry C. Wallace and his son , Henry A. Wallace , also did stints as the country 's agriculture secretary .
São Paulo , Feb 2 ( Reuters ) - A Brazil-based spokeswoman for Boeing Co said on Friday that the structure of a potential tie-up with Brazilian planemaker Embraer SA was “ still being studied ” and nothing about a possible partnership had yet been defined .

Australia spinner Nathan Lyon has spoken out against the International Cricket Council 's ( ICC ) decision to broadcast sound from the stump microphone at all times and the introduction of audible obscenities as a new offence .
The ICC announced four new violations into its revised code of conduct on Monday – attempting to gain an unfair advantage ( cheating , other than ball-tampering ) , personal abuse , audible obscenity and disobeying an umpire 's instructions .
The governing body also introduced harsher sanctions for ball-tampering at its five-day Annual Conference in Dublin .
“ I totally agree with the ball-tampering stuff , but to be honest with you , I 'm not the biggest fan of the stump mics being turned up , ” Lyon said on The Unplayable Podcast .
“ I think what 's on the field needs to stay on the field .
The 30-year-old , who last played for Australia in their final one-day international of the five-match series defeat by England last month , believes players often curse at their own failings under pressure , which might not be the best example for young fans .
“ I 'm not saying swearing is OK , but when you 're competing at the highest level and under extreme amounts of pressure , sometimes you miss your skill and therefore an expletive may come out , ” he added .
“ But we 're going to have young kids watching so as grown men we need to try and pull our heads in and realise that we 're massive role models for the game . ”
Australia are competing in a Twenty20 international tri-series against Pakistan and Zimbabwe and , having beaten both their opponents convincingly in the opening two matches , they face the South Asian nation again on Thursday .
Mumbai : Actor Sooraj Pancholi , who will be seen collaborating with choreographer and director Prabhudheva , says that he ca n't wait to work with him .
Sooraj on Thursday took to Twitter , where he shared a photograph with Prabhudheva and producer Bhushan Kumar .

Sooraj , who is the son of actor Aditya Pancholi and Zarina Wahab , made his Bollywood debut in 2015 film Hero along with female actor Athiya Shetty .
Hero , which was directed by Nikkhil Advani , is a remake of veteran filmmaker Subhash Ghai 's directed 1983 film of the same name , which starred Jackie Shroff .
A new post on the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association website tells how Jack Alexander and Arlene Myers , two AOPA Fly-In volunteers , connected over their shared love of flying at an event in July 2014 .

CLACKAMAS , Ore. – A black Oregon legislator says a constituent called the police because she looked “ suspicious ” while canvassing in her district .
Janelle Bynum , a state representative running for reelection in November , said she was going door to door in Clackamas on Tuesday when an officer from the Clackamas County Sheriff 's Office showed up .
The officer , Bynum says , was called by a resident who thought Bynum was “ suspicious . ”
Bynum said the officer responded professionally and called the constituent .
“ We talked and she did apologize . # letsbebetterneighbors , ” Bynum said in a Facebook post .
Bynum shared a photo of herself and the officer , smiling after the incident .
Bynum represents House District 51 , which serves East Portland , Damascus , Gresham , Boring , Happy Valley and North Clackamas . She is a business owner and mother of four who lives in Happy Valley , according to her campaign website . Her campaign priorities include school funding , small businesses and livable neighborhoods .
Portland City Council candidate Loretta Smith , who is friends with Bynum , said the two women have discussed teaming up to canvass together since their districts overlap and they often have to knock on doors alone .
`` It 's different for us and I think people do n't understand how it 's different for us how we campaign , how we raise money , how we serve , ” she said .
Smith said Bynum 's experience is unsettling , especially after Portland State University police shot and killed Jason Washington , a legally armed black man who witnesses say was trying to break up a fight near the college campus .
`` I think we have the whole race talk and this is exactly a part of it , '' Smith said . `` This coming on the heels of the shooting of Jason Washington , I think it 's ‘ here we go again . ' We 're wracked by these racial injustices in our backyard . I know Oregon can do better . I know Portland can do better . ”
Bynum was not the only politician to experience constituents in Clackamas calling police . Joe Buck , a white Metro council candidate from Lake Oswego , said a constituent also called police when he was canvassing in Clackamas .
`` Meeting constituents at the door is one of the best parts about serving and campaigning so it 's a bummer when it makes people nervous to see ... uh ... people walking on a sidewalk , '' Buck wrote in response to Bynum 's Facebook post .

( AP ) — In a surprising revelation , the Department of Veterans Affairs says a program that offers veterans private-sector health care will run out of money much sooner than expected .
It is holding back on some services that lawmakers worry could cause delays in medical treatment .
VA Secretary David Shulkin made the disclosure Wednesday at a Senate hearing .
He cites a shortfall of more than $ 1 billion due to increased demand from veterans for federally paid medical care outside the VA . The VA had previously assured Congress that funding for the Choice program would last until early next year , but now says it will be depleted by mid-August .
The VA is urgently asking Congress for authority to shift money from other accounts to cover the shortfall .

Chefs to audition for permanent spot at Food Truck Park in Naples
When it comes to food trucks , the owners of Jewban 's Deli—Julie Dana and husband Ray Garcia—know location is everything .
“ We get calls every single day , ‘ Where are you today ? What are you serving ? What 's on the menu ? Where are you today ? ' every single morning , ” the couple said .
That 's why they traveled from Miami to audition for a permanent spot at the Food Truck Park off Bayshore Road .
“ You can get black beans and Bubby 's chicken , and I think if you have a location with eight different things like that , how could that not be great ? ” they said .
Dana says the owner of the park is making sure the eight trucks allowed in the park are the top chefs across the country .
But not everyone is on board .
Chef Z , the owner of the Sizzle Truck , has marked his territory in Naples for the past four years .
“ I think the park presents a good opportunity for any food truck , but for us to be here locally four or five years and to not be included and even told that we 're not going to be included , is disheartening because we 're a part of this community , ” the chef said .
He adds that he 's one of five local trucks that were never asked to audition .
Now outsiders like Jewban 's Deli could be taking over .
“ It does n't matter where you 're from , ” the owners of Jewban 's said . “ If you make good food . ”

As the world reacted to news of a white nationalist rally in Charlottesville , Va. , that ended with one participant driving his car into counter-protesters and killing a woman , a crowd in this picturesque city — once a favorite Nazi retreat — made an offering with flowers and candles .
The offering had ostensibly nothing — but in fact had everything — to do with Charlottesville . The laying of flowers and candles before the arcade of the Felsenreitschule ( a riding school transformed into an arresting theater ) came at the start of the second act of Mozart 's “ La Clemenza di Tito , ” directed by Peter Sellars at the Salzburg Festival .
Former President Obama had responded to the Charlottesville news by tweeting quotes from Nelson Mandela , and it was Mandela whom Sellars cited a decade ago in discussing the need for a new look at Mozart 's last and little-loved opera . Mandela , Sellars said , attempted to break the cycles of racial violence with an “ unexpectedly humane response to terrorism , ” and in “ Clemenza ” the director makes the Roman emperor Titus , who forgives his assassins , a Mandela-like figure .
Great works of art are meant to be plumbed for insight into the human condition , and this “ Clemenza ” is examined so deeply in so many ways , it sets new standards for how to play Mozart , how to sing Mozart , how to stage Mozart , how to think about Mozart and , through the intense effort of doing all that , how to find cliché-free hope for humanity and just possibly the alternative to a world , our world , gone crazy . All the more remarkable is that this uncanny Mozartean transformation has happened in the composer 's birthplace , where Mozart can just as easily be reduced to kitsch , candy , cocktails or super-slick performances suitable for making high society feel superior .
It sets new standards for how to play Mozart , how to sing Mozart , how to stage Mozart , how to think about Mozart .
Sellars and the extraordinary Greek conductor Teodor Currentzis have radically reimagined “ Clemenza , ” an act that might have seemed pretentious were the opera less flawed or the performance less motivated or the world less needy . At the same time Mozart was finishing “ The Magic Flute , ” he was commissioned to to write an opera in tribute to Austria 's Leopold II . “ Clemenza ” was dashed off in three weeks . The libretto was a tired paean to Titus as a symbol of forgiveness and generosity ( ignoring his attempted genocide of the Jews , of course ) . Mozart had long since tossed out the archaic opera seria format .
Next to Mozart 's other late operas , character development here is weak . Motivations can seem trivial . The long , dry recitatives were outsourced .
Yet there are moments , in arias and ensembles , of ethereal beauty . Mozart offset his last days on Earth publicly sharing visions of utopia , but seething not far under the surface is the composer 's sense of political righteousness he still could n't express outright .
With Sellars , Mozartean subterfuge always sees the light of day . Rather than rely on trite love triangles to lead to an assassination attempt on Titus by an old lover and a schoolboy friend , the director makes that friend and his sister modern-day refugees . However much Titus resembles Mandela , he operates in the trappings of a police state . The dress is modern , as are the militia and suicide bombers . George Tsypin 's sets are mysteriously transparent cabinet-shaped sculptures that rise from the stage and , when lighted from inside , create the visual effect , in this context , of Mozart 's brain in operation .

Recitatives are severely cut and redone . Mozart 's music is messed with in many ways , particularly by inserting sections from Mozart 's Mass in C Minor as a kind of transcendental commentary .
Unlike Mozart 's original , in which Titus survives , the emperor in this retelling spends the second half of the opera in a hospital bed , profoundly coming to terms with betrayal and mortality . His final act is to find that Mandela state of forgiveness . Sellars ' “ Clemenza ” ends in communal act of people singing Mozart 's “ Masonic Funeral Music . ”
Ultimately , such idealism could never work on stage unless it could be proved . That proof was a gripping performance , more committed than any I have knowledge of in any Mozart opera , from a multicultural cast that compelled belief .
The men — Russell Thomas in the title role and Willard White as the Pretorian guard ( here security minister ) Publio — are well known from Sellars ' productions , including those with the Los Angeles Philharmonic . The women — Golda Schultz , Christina Gansch , Marianne Crebassa and Jeanine De Bique — are all emerging singers . There was not a single note from any of them that did sound as though it mattered .

Behind everything is Currentzis and his MusicAeterna orchestra and chorus , which he founded and which are now in residence at Perm Opera in Russia . The orchestra uses period instruments and plays them with a finesse and vitality that has no equal . The musicians stand as they play . The aria “ Parto , Parto ” includes a solo by one of Mozart 's favorite instruments ; for it the orchestra 's basset clarinetist joined Crebassa on stage in transfixing dance .
Currentzis is a micromanager on the level of , and seemingly with the genius of , Glenn Gould . His flamboyant conducting manner shares some of Gould 's physical eccentricities as well . And he also has a Gouldian virtuosity that takes your breath away , as he gets his players and his extraordinarily well-prepared chorus to produce the effect of a performer 's body and the sound produced being one and the same . In “ Parto , Parto ” singer was clarinetist and clarinetist , singer .
Three nights earlier I heard Currentzis conduct a stupendous performance of Mahler 's First Symphony , the players standing and bringing near operatic character to their individual parts . I 've never witnessed anything quite like it .
The Mahler ended with the players joyously hugging one another and Currentzis hugging everyone within reach . “ Clemenza ” ended in hugs as well , particularly between chorus and soloists .
Sellars ' “ Clemenza ” travels to Berlin and Amsterdam , not America .

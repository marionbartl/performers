SAN FRANCISCO — Investor Warren Buffett was in talks with Uber to invest $ 3 billion in the ride-hailing company before discussions went south , according to reports .
Buffett , the chairman of Berkshire Hathaway , confirmed to CNBC Wednesday that earlier this year he had discussed a sizable investment in Uber with its new CEO Dara Khosrowshahi , who is in the middle of rebranding the embattled company .
`` I 'm a great admirer of ( Khosrowshahi ) , '' Buffett said . `` Some of the reported details are not correct but it 's true that Berkshire had discussions with Uber . ''
The proposed deal , first reported by Bloomberg and The Wall Street Journal , citing unnamed sources , had echoes of Buffett 's $ 5 billion bet on Goldman Sachs during the depths of the 2008 financial crisis .

Buffett was proposing similarly favorable terms for an investment in Uber . Berkshire Hathaway was interested in a convertible loan to Uber that would have protected Buffett 's investment should Uber hit financial straits , while providing significant upside , sources told Bloomberg .
Buffett 's initial offer was well above $ 3 billion , those sources said , but Khosrowshahi tried to reduce the size of Buffett 's investment to $ 2 billion before the deal floundered .
Uber 's once high-flying valuation of around $ 66 billion took a big hit after a series of cultural and ethical scandals rocked the company last year , leading to the investor-led ouster of its co-founder and CEO Travis Kalanick .

In the wake of that shake-up , Japan 's Softbank bought a significant stake in Uber at the significantly reduced valuation of $ 48 billion .
Since taking over late last summer , Khosrowshahi , the well-regarded former CEO of Expedia , has been grappling with legacy issues related to his predecessors — ranging from push-back from cities such as London and lawsuits for women who say they are not safe riding in an Uber — to obstacles that have cropped up under his watch .
That includes the recent crash of an Uber self-driving car in Arizona during testing , which killed a pedestrian as she was crossing the street at night .
Uber recently announced it was pulling out of all tests in Arizona , and that it would resume self-driving car work in other cities as soon as federal regulators conclude their investigation into the accident .

The federal government has agreed to give the provinces and territories a 75 per cent share of the tax revenues from the sale of legalized marijuana , a portion of which will be meted out to cities and towns to help them defray the cost of making pot legal across Canada .
Finance Minister Bill Morneau announced the two-year agreement today after a day-long meeting with his provincial and territorial counterparts .
Morneau says Ottawa will retain the remaining 25 per cent share to a maximum of $ 100 million a year , with any balance over and above that limit going to the provinces and territories .
The larger share , he added , will allow the provinces to “ fairly deal with their costs and so they can work with municipalities , ” which had been asking for at least a one-third portion of the revenue to help ease the burden of costs like law enforcement .

Morneau said that over the first two years , the federal government expects legalized pot to generate only about $ 400 million in tax revenues , adding that the ministers are scheduled to gather again a year from now to assess how the framework is working .
“ Our expectation is that by keeping prices low , we will be able to get rid of the black market . However , that will happen over time , ” Morneau said during a closing news conference , his counterparts lined up behind him .
“ Our estimates suggest that the size of the taxation revenue is roughly … about up to $ 400 million for the first couple of years . What we 've agreed at our table today is that we need to come back together ; we 're going to come back together in December 2018 to look at how the market 's working , and how the federal government , provinces and municipalities are dealing with this change .
“ Of course , we 'll stay very much on top of this , but after two years it 's time to rethink the approach to make sure we 're getting it right . ”
All 14 jurisdictions at the table agreed to the key principles reached at the meeting , Morneau said , calling it a “ very good outcome . ”
The original model put forward by the federal government proposed an even 50-50 split , a plan that was immediately shot down by the provinces , many of which wondered aloud what sort of costs Ottawa would be incurring to deserve such a share .
Earlier today , Ontario Finance Minister Charles Sousa said the federal Liberal government had successfully made the case that it , too , would have costs , but was showing flexibility on related revenue and cost-sharing questions .
After a meeting with his Atlantic counterparts in Halifax , Nova Scotia Premier Stephen McNeil let slip that a two-year deal had been reached , and that provinces would have the ability to include a markup above and beyond existing taxation levels .
Ottawa 's initial estimates suggested the total pot of tax revenue from marijuana sales could eventually reach $ 1 billion per year .
“ If there is a markup that a respective province wants to do it would be outside of that taxation model , so that was the flexibility that we as a province were looking for and I would say indeed it was what we were hearing across the country , ” McNeil said .
“ The two-year window will give each of us the time to go back to the table and say this is actually what policing is costing and this is what the education component is . ”
The Federation of Canadian Municipalities has said it wants a third of the revenues earmarked to help municipal governments handle administrative and policing costs , but how that share of the pot is divvied up will be up to the municipalities and their provincial or territorial counterparts .
The federal government has already committed more than $ 1 billion over five years towards pot legalization in areas like policing and border security .
When asked about the federal push to ensure enough money goes to cities and towns , Quebec Finance Minister Carlos Leitao said each province will do it their own way .
“ Of course , the provinces will work with their municipalities , but it 's for us to decide what that percentage will be , ” he said . “ And every province is different , every city is different , so there is no preconceived amount for the provinces . ”
During the meetings , the ministers also discussed the federal government 's proposed tweaks to the formula behind equalization payments , as well as the three-year review of the Canada Pension Plan . They also explored the state of the global economy and heard a presentation from Bank of Canada governor Stephen Poloz .
Talks also took place on a national strategy to improve the sharing of information on corporate ownership between jurisdictions , a measure designed to clamp down on tax avoidance , tax evasion , money laundering and terrorist financing .
“ We agreed to take concrete steps to make sure that we had knowledge of who owns companies across our country so that we can do a better job at ensuring that we do n't have tax evasion , that we do n't have money laundering , that we do n't have terrorist financing in any part of our country , ” Morneau said .

To celebrate the Uniting Church in Australia 's 40th anniversary , Bec Lindsay from Hope Uniting Church , Maroubra , explains how she came to be a follower of Christ .
My entry into the Uniting Church was through Bible Study . I discovered Christian Students Uniting , part of the Synod 's tertiary chaplaincy work , in my last year of study . In the weekly Bible studies , I found a space in which to explore previously unasked questions about how God , life and discipleship fit together . Being part of this discipleship community strengthened my desire to follow after Christ . I found my faith coming alive in a new way .
As I learned more about the Uniting Church and it 's founding , I saw that this vibrance had always been there — in The Basis of Union and the vision of three diverse denominations bringing their treasures together to worship God , as well as in the inaugural Statement to the Nation and its desire to speak into the wider Australian community .
I still see that vibrant discipleship and am excited about the possibility of God 's Spirit continuing to push us forward towards the transformation of our Congregations and the wider communities in which they gather .
For me , the vibrance is present in small moments like when we hand out percussion to everyone at Hope Uniting in Sunday worship and see the joy of being God 's people together . There are also the not-so-small moments , like the stories from Yurora or the passion for justice on display at the Palm Sunday Peace March .
My hope for myself and for this Uniting Church is that we would continue to hear and take on board some of the often repeated words of scripture — ‘ Do not be afraid ' and ‘ Follow me . '

The Toronto Marlies are on the verge of sweeping the Canucks ' farm team right out of the AHL Calder Cup playoffs and they 're doing it without their best player .
That would be Andreas Johnsson , the 23-year-old who is currently busy playing for coach Mike Babcock , and who has had a role in turning around the Toronto Maple Leafs ' first-round series .
His storyline should have legs in Vancouver for a couple of reasons . One , he 's a small , skilled Swedish forward who had success in North America immediately after dominating Sweden 's top league . This seems relevant for the Canucks , no ?
Plus , Babcock has shown significant trust in him in the playoffs . Johnsson has Toronto 's lowest percentage of five-on-five offensive-zone starts ( 18.52 , which ranks 315th of the 321 players in the post-season ) . This , despite having played only nine regular season games . Oh , and he may get the start in Game 7 over a now-healthy veteran , Leo Komarov . At least , he should .
The second reason feels even more critical in Vancouver these days . Johnsson was a seventh-round draft pick . He 's fast , highly skilled and was passed over round after round in the 2013 NHL Entry Draft because , in part , he was too small . He still is , at 180 pounds .
Stories like his , mid- to late-round draft picks having an impact in these playoffs , are all over the teams that remain . Pittsburgh 's Jake Guentzel , a former third-round pick , is tied for the lead in points with 13 . Tampa 's Brayden Point , a third-round pick , is averaging 18 minutes a game . Nashville 's Viktor Arvidsson and Mattias Ekholm , both fourth-round picks , are massive contributors .
San Jose 's Kevin Labanc is helping drive the Sharks ' third line . He put up two points in four games and was n't on the ice for a goal against . He was a sixth rounder in 2014 .
Up until now , stockpiling mid- to late-round draft picks has not been a priority for the Canucks ' rebuilding program . It 's been viewed as counter-intuitive because , duh , the Canucks hired a former scout to be their general manager . In addition , they 've made some nice value selections in the years since , adding centre Adam Gaudette ( a fifth rounder ) and goalie Thatcher Demko ( a second ) , both of whom are expected to be critical components of the next core .
The Canucks have uncovered a host of others outside of their first-round marquee picks who have NHL upside , including defenceman Guillaume Brisebois , forwards Lukas Jasek and Kole Lind , plus netminder Michael DiPietro . Meanwhile , blueliners Gustav Forsling and Nikita Tryamkin , who had potential to be the best pick of them all , have already played NHL games .
In other words , the team has had some success with these picks . So it 's confusing that the team 's strategy has n't been to play to these strengths . Instead , since Vancouver GM Jim Benning was hired in 2014 the Canucks have had a significant deficit in terms of the value of picks they 've traded and the ones they 've acquired .
The good news is things appear to be changing . After the trade deadline , the Canucks were adamant they wanted to get a draft pick for Thomas Vanek , but not one was offered . In this case , it 's the thought that counts .
Vanek was n't seen as a forward who had much value because he disappeared too often in playoff games . And guess what ? It happened again this year , and in his elimination game for Columbus he did n't even play nine minutes for John Tortorella .
But the Canucks do have valuable players they can move heading into the 2018 NHL Entry Draft in Dallas . You can start with Chris Tanev , the valuable shutdown defenceman . The only knock on him is the number of freak injuries he 's suffered in the past few years that has kept his games played under 70 for three straight seasons .
Tanev is still so valuable and it 's a good bet his luck would change on a team that had the puck a lot .
The idea of trading Tanev has become the stuff of legends in Vancouver , and so far the Canucks have avoided the temptation . But with the Erik Gudbranson contract extension , it feels more likely than ever before that Vancouver will pull the trigger .
There 's also Ben Hutton , who could be a good buy-low candidate for a team looking for a defenceman who could really benefit from a change of scenery and a new coaching staff .
Hutton 's salary is problematic at US $ 2.8 million , but he did play well when he was paired with pretty much any defenceman not named Erik Gudbranson .
Finally , there 's Sven Baertschi , a productive winger who would be a lock to score 20 goals if he could stay healthy for an entire season . His three-year shooting percentage of 15.5 per cent is top 20 in the NHL .
The Canucks have lots of wingers who could potentially replace Baertschi in the top six , including Nikolay Goldobin . Does that mean they should trade Baertschi for draft picks ?
They sure should consider it .

You may know that your surgeon is using the latest minimally invasive technology for your surgery , but how do you know if they 've mastered it ?
To help answer that question , researchers at Keck Medicine of USC looked to a custom recording tool similar in concept to a flight recorder on an airplane . When attached to a robotic surgery system during radical prostatectomy procedures , the most common treatment for prostate cancer , the “ black box ” recorder captured data that could be used to discern the difference between novice and expert surgeons . The results of the study will appear in the January 2018 edition of The Journal of Urology .
“ Robotic surgery has been widely adopted by urologic surgeons , but methods of assessing proficiency vary widely between institutions , ” says lead author Andrew Hung , MD , assistant professor of clinical urology at the Keck School of Medicine of USC . “ In order to be credentialed by institutions to use the robotic system , surgeons must be evaluated by their peers for a handful of procedures , but the evaluations are not ongoing , and sometimes evaluators do n't agree on what constitutes proficiency . ”
Creating a sustainable , objective method for evaluating surgeon proficiency and standardizing credentialing is a way to help ensure patient safety , Hung explains .
The recorder used in the study , called the dVLogger , captures both anonymized video and movement data . Developed by Intuitive Surgical , the research tool can attach to the company 's da Vinci® Surgical System , a robotic surgical platform approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for general laparoscopic surgery .
“ The dVLogger records the surgeon 's movements , capturing where the instruments are and how the surgeon is moving the instruments , ” Hung says .
To test the recorder 's ability to measure proficiency , four basic prostate surgery steps were analyzed . Data from 100 procedures performed by both novice and expert surgeons were recorded . Results showed that novice and expert surgeons could be identified by measuring time to complete operative steps ; distance of instrument and camera travel ; and frequency of camera movements .
Hung says that future studies will explore how the recorded performance data compares to clinical outcomes . “ We now have an opportunity to put surgeon proficiency under the microscope and see what role it plays in patient outcomes , ” he says .
As part of his mission to deglamorize cocaine , Gordon Ramsay revealed that some of his dinner guests have requested he uses the drug as an ingredient in their food .
“ I 've been asked to dust cocaine on top of soufflés , to put it on as icing sugar…coke 's everywhere , ” he said during his docuseries , “ Gordon on Cocaine. ” “ It 's spiraling out of control . ”
Ramsay , 50 , who has embarked on a journey to expose the dark side of the club drug in his two-part TV special , was in Columbia to watch the drug-making process , which included covering coca leaves in cement powder , diluted sulfuric acid , and battery acid .
“ I 've cooked some serious s–t in my life but nothing quite on this level , ” the TV chef said while watching the farmer 's step-by-step process .
The “ MasterChef ” star — who admitted he 's been offered cocaine before — had his own tragic experience with the drug . In 2003 , a protege of his died suffered a fatal fall after overdosing on the drug .
The show airs on British network ITV and , according to Deadline , may soon be headed to the United States .
DETROIT > > General Motors is extending the normal two-week summer shutdown for at least two U.S. car factories because of slumping sedan sales .
Union officials say the Lordstown , Ohio , plant near Cleveland and the Fairfax plant in Kansas City , Kansas , will close for as many as five weeks in June and July . The company confirmed that some car factories would be shut down longer than usual but would not give details . Lordstown makes the Chevrolet Cruze compact sedan , while Fairfax builds the Chevrolet Malibu midsize car .
The additional shutdowns come as all automakers struggle to deal with a shrinking U.S. market that is dramatically shifting away from cars toward trucks and SUVs of all sizes . Some are continuing to produce cars and selling them to rental car companies or offering big discounts to individual buyers while others are cutting production . Through May , U.S. car sales were down 11 percent while truck and SUV sales rose nearly 5 percent , according to Autodata Corp .
Also , overall demand for vehicles is slowing after seven years of growth . Total U.S. sales are down 2 percent through May and many analysts are predicting that full-year sales will slow to 17.2 million , compared with last years record of 17.5 million .

Robert Morales , president of a United Auto Workers union local at the Lordstown factory , says the plant will stop production for the last two weeks in June and another three weeks in July . Its just to align with market demand , thats all ,  he said Wednesday .
The Lordstown plant has about 3,000 hourly and salaried workers . Last year GM suspended the third shift at the plant indefinitely as demand dropped . The Fairfax plant has about 3,500 workers .
It was unclear whether other GM plants will see extended summer shutdowns , which normally happen over the July 4 holiday as factories switch to the next model year .
Spokesman Jim Cain would not comment on specifics of the shutdowns , He did say that GM full-size pickup truck factories also would have longer-than-normal summer shutdowns because they are switching over to an all new truck for the 2018 model year .
Normally workers get most of their pay through unemployment benefits and company subsidies . But that only lasts for about a year .
Cruze sales are up 36 percent this year due largely to sales to rental car companies and other fleet buyers . Sales to individual buyers are down 3 percent . Malibu sales are down 30 percent through May , including a 54 percent dip in fleet sales , according to Cain .
GM , he said , is cutting rental car sales even as car sales slump in order to protect profit margins and resale values of its used cars .
According to Wards Automotive , GM dealers have enough Cruzes to handle 87 days worth of sales , while they have 67 days worth of Malibus . Automakers consider a 60-day supply optimal to give customers adequate choices .

GALION — A permanent monument for the Crawford County Veterans Hall of Fame is nearing completion and is on schedule to be open to the public this summer on the lawn area of the Crawford County Courthouse .
Several members of the hall of fame board visited the new location of Longstreth Memorials on Ohio 598 in Galion on Wednesday to get a first-look at the monument that features five wings representing each branch of the military .
“ Everything looks wonderful . They are doing a beautiful job , ” said board member Chuck Christman of the $ 100,000 project funded with donations and grants .
Ben Garverick of Longstreth Memorials has been engraving famous quotes from some former presidents , including John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan , on the monument .
“ It is an honor to work on all of the monuments and stones that we do here , and it is an honor to be a part of this , ” Garverick said . “ I think all of us that work in this business leave a little bit of ourselves with every stone we do . This is something I can take my family to see 20 years from now and be proud that I got to be a part of it . ”
Longstreth Memorials ' Sean Longstreth has provided the group with a blueprint of the final project to the board .
“ Steve Harter and Woody Dyer will be laying the groundwork for the project as the weather cooperates , ” said Don Scheerer , vice president of the organization that formed in 2006 . “ The pavers will be placed around the monument in a 35-foot circle , in the garden area and as part of the walkway . Oberlander 's will be in charge of the landscaping . ”
Sean Longstreth said the project is on target to be completed in June .
“ In time for the Fourth of July , which is the goal , ” he said . “ The progress really depends on the weather . There is a lot of outside work to do . ”

Auburn University faculty staff and students celebrated the opening of the Tiger Cage Accelerator and Incubator Friday .
The ribbon cutting ceremony showcased the new location in Auburn University 's Research Park . The space allows for greater collaboration , and a larger working space for students to expand their entrepreneurial ideas .
“ What we wanted to do was to help provide some structure for student entrepreneurs . Working out of their home or their apartment or dorm , that kind of sometimes limits their ability to be successful ; they are infringing on maybe their roommates space . By providing formal space for students , what we want to be able to do is help them legitimize their business , but also provide some guidance so that they can advance through the different stages of the entrepreneurship process , ” said Managing Director of Lowder Center for Family Business and Entrepreneurship , Lakami Baker .
One student entrepreneur who previously worked out of apartments and attics said this new facility has helped his business .
“ It 's a great space . It really legitimizes our business , instead of us saying , `` Hey we 're out of this garage , or this apartment . We have a legit business and this great facility and it has really made our business flourish , ' '' says Funnel , LLC Founder Jackson Speaks .
Baker says they are looking forward to moving to a new location in Research Park within the next two years .

A confident Justice Neil M. Gorsuch took his seat on the Supreme Court for the first time Monday and quickly joined colleagues in firing questions at lawyers in three highly procedural disputes .
He was enthusiastic and well-prepared , despite having only a few days to get ready for the arguments . And the new justice showed he had clear views on how the cases should be resolved .
“ Would n't it be a lot easier if we just followed the plain text of the statute ? ” Gorsuch asked a government lawyer . “ What am I missing ? ” He repeated the reference to the “ plain words ” or “ plain text ” of the law during all three arguments .
He cut short a lawyer who cited earlier rulings in favor of employees who had sued for discrimination and added , “ We 're not asking this court to break new ground . ”
Gorsuch interjected : “ No , just to continue to make it up . ”
He also chided a lawyer who failed to give a clear answer in response to his queries .
“ That 's not a trick question , ” he said during a complicated property rights dispute .
And he sounded unswayed by a lawyer for the California public employees retirement fund who defended its decision to file a separate suit in 2011 against Lehman Bros. and one of its insurers on the grounds the rules governing class-action claims were ambiguous .
Gorsuch pointed to the “ plain text ” of the 1934 securities law . It says , “ in no event ” may new claims be filed more than three years after the sale of an allegedly fraudulent stock .
“ Where 's the ambiguity in ‘ in no event ' ? ” Gorsuch asked .
His opening day performance matched that of other new justices who were veterans of a federal appeals court . Justice Sonia Sotomayor asked more than three dozen questions during her first full day in October 2009 . But many other newcomers have sat silently and listened to the fast-moving arguments during their first weeks on the high court .
Gorsuch , 49 , succeeds one his heroes , the late Justice Antonin Scalia , who famously insisted the court should decide cases based on the literal words of the law , not its purpose or how it has been interpreted by lower courts . Gorsuch made clear from the start he will try to follow Scalia 's approach .
But frequently the high court takes up cases because of a conflict between two laws , or because the text of the law is confusing .
The first case heard Monday was one such dispute . At issue was whether a federal employee who says he was a victim of discrimination should appeal his claims through the system for civil service appeals or before a federal district judge .
And as Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. noted , the law was anything but clear .
“ This is unbelievably complicated.… Nobody who is not a lawyer and no ordinary lawyer could read these statutes and figure out what they are supposed to do , ” he told the government 's lawyer . “ Who wrote this statute ? Somebody who takes pleasure out of pulling the wings off flies ? ”
When the gavel sounded at 10 a.m , the nine justices appeared from behind the red curtain , and Gorsuch took his place at the right end seated next to Sotomayor .
“ Before we commence the business of the court this morning , ” Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. said , “ it gives me great pleasure on behalf of myself and my colleagues to welcome Justice Gorsuch as the 101st associate justice of this court . Justice Gorsuch , we wish you a long and happy career in our common calling . ”
Gorsuch turned and said he wanted to thank “ each of my new colleagues for the very warm welcome I received last week . I appreciate it very much . ”
Earlier on Monday , the justices issued an orders list which showed they had taken no action in a series of closely watched appeals . They include appeals from a Colorado baker who refused to make a wedding cake for a same-sex couple and from California gun owners who sued when they were denied a permit to carry a concealed weapon .
Court officials said Gorsuch had decided not to participate in Thursday 's closed-door conference because he wanted to prepare for the three days of oral arguments this week . The appeals will be considered again at a conference Friday .

He will arrive around 12 noon , '' Additional District Magistrate ( ADM ) Manoj Thakur told PTI.The prime minister will arrive at Ramnagar in the district via Jabalpur and address a convention , an official release stated , adding he would take part in the 'Aadi Mahotsav ' event , beginning on Wednesday.Around 2,000 experts on Panchayati Raj system will participate in the convention , he said.Another release said Modi will launch the Rashtriya Gramin Swaraj Abhiyan at a public meeting and address Panchayati Raj representatives across the country , from Mandla.On this occasion , the prime minister will unveil a road map for overall development of tribals during the next five years and will unveil a plaque to mark the laying of foundation stone of an LPG bottling plant of Indian Oil Corporation at Maneri in Mandla district . He would also launch a local government directory , it said.The prime minister would felicitate the sarpanchs of the villages that have achieved 100 per cent smokeless kitchens , full vaccination under Mission Indradhanush , and 100 per cent electrification under Saubhagya Scheme , it said.Modi will fly back to Delhi from Jabalpur around 3 PM.Ramnagar is situated on the banks of the Narmada river . A number of ancient monuments associated with erstwhile Gond ( tribe ) rulers are situated in the town , surrounded by thick forest.Elaborate security arrangements are being made for the prime minister 's visit , an official said.Former Union minister and Mandla MP Faggan Singh Kulaste said the 'Aadi Mahotsav ' , a three-day event , is aimed at showcasing the rich heritage and traditions of tribals.Meanwhile , the Aadivasi Mahapanchayat , an outfit working for the rights of tribals , has questioned the rationale behind organising the festival , claiming that earlier announcements for welfare of tribals made in similar events were never implemented . `` What is the rationale behind organising this Aadi Mahotsav when announcements made during similar events being organised since the last three years were not yet implemented ? '' questioned former MLAs Narayan Singh Patta , Bhupendra Barkade and Dr Ashok Marskole at a joint press conference on Wednesday.They demanded that Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan apologise for `` making false promises to tribals in the state '' . `` On the one hand , the Aadi Mahotsav is organised to conserve tribal culture , while on the other hand , the heritage sites situated in Ramnagar were removed from the list of protected monuments , '' they said.Meanwhile , a memorandum demanding that the prime minister cancel the proposed nuclear power plant at Chutka , was submitted to Mandla district collector on Wednesday by `` Chutka Parmanu Virodhi Sangarsh Samiti '' .
Excellent news , Marvel fans ! With Guardians of the Galaxy Vol . 2 just about to hit theaters and the early buzz being very good , many have been wondering about the third installment and whether or not director James Gunn will return when that movie inevitably happens . Today that has been cleared up as the director himself has declared that he will be back to both write and direct Guardians of the Galaxy Vol . 3 .
The director took to his Facebook page in order to make the announcement ahead of the press tour for Guardians of the Galaxy Vol . 2 . This is a question that writter and director James Gunn has had to address in the past and his answer , up until now , has always been uncertain . But his love for the characters and the world that he has created trumped any trepidations he may have had . Here is what he had to say about it in his Facebook post .
`` So , after many months of ruminations and discussions , I know the answer . I could save this answer for the first , random interviewer to ask me during the press junket but instead I thought I 'd share it with the most important people in the Guardiansverse , you , the fans , who have been so incredibly supportive and enthusiastic over the past five years , it has moved me to tears on a regular basis . So , yes , I 'm returning to write and directGuardians of the Galaxy Vol . 3 . In the end , my love for Rocket , Groot , Gamora , Star-Lord , Yondu , Mantis , Drax , and Nebula , and some of the other forthcoming heroes , goes deeper than you guys can possibly imagine , and I feel they have more adventures to go on and things to learn about themselves and the wonderful and sometimes terrifying universe we all inhabit . And , like in both Vol . 1 and Vol . 2 , we will work on creating the story that goes beyond what you expect . ''
This is good news for many reasons . For one , that says a lot about how good Guardians of the Galaxy Vol . 2 probably is . If James Gunn had any doubts about what he was able to accomplish with the sequel , he would likely be less certain about returning . But announcing that he is coming back for Guardians of the Galaxy 3 is a sign that we 're in for a very special treat when Vol . 2 hits theaters here in a few short weeks . The movie scored a perfect 100 % at a test screening not long ago , which very rarely happens . James Gunn was the driving force behind the first Guardians of the Galaxy as well , which was something that was initially considered a huge risk for Marvel Studios . Now it is one of the most beloved movies in the MCU . While the director could n't reveal much about the third movie in the Guardians of the Galaxy trilogy , he did give some idea of what to expect .
`` Much of what 's happened in the MCU for the past ten or so years has been leading , in a big way , to the Avengers ' Infinity War . Guardians of the Galaxy Vol . 3 will happen after all that . It will conclude the story of this iteration of the Guardians of the Galaxy , and help catapult both old and new Marvel characters into the next ten years and beyond . I will be working side-by-side with Kevin Feige and the gang to help design where these stories go , and make sure the future of the Marvel Cosmic Universe is as special and authentic and magical as what we have created so far . I promise you , the fans , I 'll do it all with integrity and love and respect for the characters . ''
There is no word on a possible release date for Guardians of the Galaxy Vol . 3 , but Kevin Feige did say last year that revealing any titles that will be released after Avengers : Infinity War and Avengers 4 could be venturing into spoiler territory . So we may not get that info for a little while . As for Guardians of the Galaxy Vol . 2 ? You wo n't have to wait that long as the movie is set for release on May 5 . You can check out James Gunn 's entire announcement post for yourself below .

Getting a new pharmaceutical from an idea in the chemistry lab to market takes many years and billions of dollars . Each year just several dozen new drugs are approved for use in the United States .
Human “ organs-on-chips ” are leading a revolution in drug safety testing . These devices use human cells to model the structure and function of human organs and tissues . By testing the potential effects of drugs on different organs faster than traditional methods , organs-on-chips can reduce the need for animal studies and better predict which new drugs will effectively treat human disease .
As part of an interdisciplinary research team , we 're working on a kidney-on-a-chip to improve our understanding of how kidney diseases begin and which drugs can safely treat them .
* * * * * * * * * *
Historically , laboratory testing for new drugs is performed in cells grown in dishes or flasks . If a drug passes initial screening tests in vitro , researchers next test it in vivo in live animals to determine the effects of a new drug on a whole system instead of just one cell type at a time . Finally , after many years of laboratory investigation , researchers will test a promising new drug in people to see if it is safe and effective .
The problem is 9 out of 10 of these drugs never make it from small-scale human tests to the patient because they turn out to be ineffective or toxic , even if they showed promising results in early testing .
Organs-on-chips have the potential to completely transform that system . Ranging from the size of a fingernail to that of a credit card , they 're composed of fluid channels and tiny chambers that contain human cell samples . Organs-on-chips in development in labs around the country include kidney , lung , liver , intestine , skin , brain , heart , bone and reproductive systems .
In an organ-on-a-chip , flowing liquid supplies the cells with oxygen and nutrients , similar to the way blood sustains cells in the human body . It 's this constant flow that makes these devices special . Cells grown in organs-on-chips devices act more like cells in a human organ than do cells grown in flat dishes without flow .
* * * * * * * * * *
Kidneys are incredibly important to overall human health . The two fist-sized kidneys remove drugs and unwanted compounds from the body and play a critical role in maintaining proper salt and water balance , blood pressure and vitamin D and bone health . Genetic conditions and even commonly administered medications can , in some circumstances , damage the kidneys .
In the U.S. , 15 percent of adults have kidney diseases . But most do n't even know it , because kidney diseases often display no symptoms until the condition is very advanced . There 's a pressing need to understand how kidney disease begins , and to develop new safe and effective treatments .
Here at the University of Washington , our kidney-on-a-chip research team is composed of scientists from many different disciplines , including pharmacy , pharmaceutical sciences , nephrology ( kidney medicine ) , toxicology , biochemistry and bioengineering .
In partnership with Nortis , Inc. , a local biotechnology company , our team has created a small device — the size of a business card — with up to three tiny tubes , each one-thousandth the size of a drop of water , containing 5,000 human kidney cells . When tiny amounts of fluid are pumped through the tubes , the kidney cells are exposed to important signals that help the cells in the chip behave as if they were in a live kidney .
We 've found that the kidney cells release signals – called biomarkers – of injury when exposed to known kidney toxins . Our research showed that cells on the chip released markers of injury commonly seen in the urine of people with kidney damage . Testing with the older method , using cells on plates , did not show any damage with the same treatment . This suggests that the kidney-on-a-chip may be better than existing methods at predicting if a new drug will cause kidney damage in humans .
* * * * * * * * * * Now that we 've had these promising results , scientific teams across the country are starting to connect different organs together to replicate a more complex , multi-organ system , to give greater insights into how drugs affect people . For example , we were able to connect a liver-on-a-chip to a kidney-on-a-chip to learn how a plant extract used in some herbal medicines , called aristolochic acid , damages kidney cells . This chip-to-chip investigation reinforces the need for interconnected organs-on-a-chip to replicate the complex mechanics in the human body . In the coming year , our kidney-on-a-chip project will be one of several sent to the International Space Station where low gravity speeds up changes in cells , sometimes causing health problems for astronauts . The Space Station could be the perfect place to find out more about kidney diseases in weeks , rather than years or decades . Organs-on-chips can also be used to discover new drug targets . Our team is evaluating the kidney-on-a-chip as a tool to personalize drug selection and dosing in people with kidney cancer , polycystic kidney disease and chronic kidney disease . Other organs-on-chips labs around the country are studying diseases of the immune system , brain , lungs , heart and blood vessels . By working together , dozens of research teams are developing this new technology to revolutionize drug discovery , leading to the development of better and safer medications for all .

However , Tolentin said , they are still trying to finalize the mechanics on how to go about Espino 's proposal which the police director wanted implemented in different parishes in the region .
Meanwhile , security preparation are already in place for the dawn Masses that will start on Saturday .
Tolentin said they are setting up police assistance centers in all parishes in Central Visayas to attend to the people 's need .
“ Every parish will be monitored by our policemen , ” Tolentin added .

LOS ANGELES-Paris Hilton 's new range of Paris Hilton Cosmetics was inspired by unicorns and mermaids .
The 36-year-old socialite released an ‘ 'undercover '' beauty collection , and the star is set to expand her make-up line and release new products to her eponymous label by the end of this month , which the blonde beauty has revealed was influenced by mythical creatures .
Speaking to E ! News about her latest venture , the ‘ The Simple Life ' star said : ‘ 'We just did a soft launch , so I did n't talk about it before . It was undercover . It 's exciting - every time I sent out the orders , within a day or two , they 've been completely sold out . ‘ 'This line is inspired by unicorns , and the next line is inspired by mermaids . It 's all iridescent and holographic with really beautiful packaging . I always loved glitter and , especially now , I 'm loving glitter on a whole new level . '' And the television personality has revealed the next installment will feature a ‘ 'whole glitter collection '' because she is ‘ 'obsessed '' with sparkly objects .
She added : ‘ 'For the next collection , we have a whole glitter collection coming out . I 'm obsessed with sparkles . ''
Paris has hinted her love of MAC Cosmetics also triggered her to create a range of beauty products , because she wanted to make items that are not as ‘ 'sticky '' as the competitor , and are more ‘ 'comfortable '' to wear .
Speaking about the criteria for her creations , she said : ‘ 'That the colour not only looks good but feels good and the texture of it . Like with Mac , I used to be obsessed with the Lipglass , but it was just very sticky . Paris has released over 20 fragrances throughout her career and she has admitted her strong work ethic has been installed in her by her family when she was a child . She said : ‘ 'Ever since I was a little girl , I was really blessed to grow up in a family that really instilled work ethic into me and made me want at a very young age to be independent , to be a businesswoman , and that 's just something that 's always been through my veins .
So I love now that I 'm seeing all these other young women that are coming out with their brands , and makeup , and shoes , or whatever . I love seeing people being creative in that way . I 'm all about girl power and being a girl boss , so it 's really cool to see so many of them out there . ''
Ghost In The Shell
Budget : $ 110 million Financed by : DreamWorks ; Paramount ; Reliance Entertainment ; Weying Technology Domestic Gross : Still in release Domestic Distributor : Paramount Overseas Gross : Still in release Directed by : Rupert Sanders Scarlett Johansson Takeshi Kitano Starring : Produced by : Ari Arad
The live action adaptation of the Ghost In The Shell manga began to actively move forward at DreamWorks in 2014 . DreamWorks ' financing partner Reliance Entertainment also contributed coin and Paramount boarded the project as co-financier and would handle international distribution . The reported budget was $ 110 million . DreamWorks ' domestic distribution was contracted with Disney at the time and the mouse house first dated Ghost In The Shell for April 14 , 2017 . Disney soon shifted the date to March 31 . In September 2015 , DreamWorks and Disney decided to not renew their agreement , which was set to expire in August 2016 and in January 2016 Disney removed the movie from their schedule . Paramount took over domestic distribution duties .
In January 2017 , Paramount inked a one billion dollar slate financing agreement with Chinese companies Huahua Media and Shanghai Film Group and Ghost In The Shell would be one of the many movies covered under the arrangement . Less than one month before Ghost In The Shell was set to open , very little money was allocated to Paramount from the two Chinese giants and the deal is currently in peril . At this time it is unknown if Paramount will see any of the slate money to reduce their exposure on Ghost In The Shell . This article will be updated after Paramount , Huahua and Shanghai sort out their wheelings and dealings .
Less than two weeks before the film was set to open , Chinese movie ticket company Weying Technology took a minority investment in the picture and in return would see 10 % of the global gross .
In the many months leading up to the release for Ghost In The Shell , a whitewashing controversy erupted about the casting of Scarlett Johansson for what should have been an asian role . Still , tracking was relatively strong and Paramount heavily invested in a domestic P & A spend . As per iSpotTV , $ 29.84 million was spent on national TV ads , plus millions more on other traditional means of advertising and distribution expenses . The domestic P & A expenses on Ghost In The Shell is north of $ 40 million .
Reviews were mixed and as the picture was going into its opening weekend , tracking was pointing to a soft mid $ 20 million bow . Ghost In The Shell opened against DreamWorks Animation 's The Boss Baby and it came in below expectations with $ 18,676,033 . More troubling was the 12.8 % decline in attendance from Friday night to Saturday , which did not bode well for its longevity in theaters . The film sank 60.9 % the following weekend to $ 7,306,413 and lost 67.2 % of the movie going public in its third frame to $ 2.4 million . More as the domestic numbers post…
For its international run , Ghost In The Shell opened day and date in 52 markets and pulled in $ 40.1 million . In its second overseas frame , the film was released in China to $ 21.4 million and the weekend haul was $ 41.3 million . For its third session , Ghost In The Shell was crushed by The Fate Of The Furious , which took most of the global marketplace to itself and it pulled in just $ 8.3 million .
The picture had a decent start in Japan , where the source material is beloved and co-star ( and icon ) Takeshi Kitano was in his first western studio movie since the ridiculous 1995 film Johnny Mnemonic . The Japan numbers were $ 3.3 million , placing # 1 for the weekend . The current gross is $ 5.9 million .
The current offshore cume is $ 115.1 million . More as the numbers come in…
The federal government has embarked on a couple of initi­atives to support the project to buy a new fleet of fighter jets for the RCAF . The aircraft will replace the air force 's CF-18s .
Through a Request for Pro­posal issued earlier this month , the Canadian govern­ment will be hiring an inde­pendent third-party reviewer to help validate various pro­curement documents and sup­port processes relating to the Future Fighter Capability Pro­ject . The reviewer 's role will be to provide defence pro­curement and financial expert analysis to ensure that the procurement approach “ is designed to deliver the desired outcomes , ” according to Pub­lic Services and Procurement Canada .
The list of eligible suppliers for the new fighter jet includes the following teams ( in alpha­betical order ) :
France—Dassault Avia­tion ( Thales DMS France SAS and Safran Aircraft Engines )
Sweden—SAAB AB ( publ ) —Aeronautics
United Kingdom and Northern Ireland—Airbus Defense and Space GmbH
United States— Lockheed Martin Corporation ( Lock­heed Martin Aero­nautics Company )
United States—The Boeing Company
Only these suppliers will be invited to participate in subsequent formal engage­ment activities and to sub­mit proposals , according to the government .
In parallel with discus­sions with these suppliers , the Canadian government will continue to talk to other firms to gather and share general information related to the procure­ment . This aims to make sure that Canadian aero­space and defence firms can play a role in the procurement .
Innovation , Science and Economic Development , in partnership with National Defence and Public Ser­vices and Procurement will conduct regional forums across Canada , according to the federal government . These forums , to be held in the cities listed below , will be an opportunity for the Canadian aerospace and defence sectors to learn more about the Industrial and Technological Benefits Policy including the Value Proposition and to engage with potent ial prime contractors :
“ Boyne City works because Boyne City works together , ” said Boyne City Manager Michael Cain at the 2009 State of the Community Breakfast .

“ Boyne City works because Boyne City works together , ” said Boyne City Manager Michael Cain at the 2009 State of the Community Breakfast .
Now , eight years later , on the eve of this year 's State of the Community luncheon , the Boyne City Gazette asked you what makes this place so special .
1 . Close-Knit Community – Asking around throughout Boyne City , one of the main focus points of various community members is the close-knit nature of the locals . This is often visible in the tendency Boyne City residents have to unite behind a cause .
Recent examples include the “ Team Boone ” events aimed at raising awareness and funds for the cause of a child facing medical needs , as well as citizens uniting for causes such as support of the new city facilities , water fluoridation ( both those in favor and against ) , and dozens of fundraising benefits for various causes and families .
2 . Free Medical Care – The Boyne Area Free Clinic provides free medical care to the uninsured and under-insured alike .
Located on State Street , the clinic was founded by Dr. Richard Mansfield , who was recruited into the Boyne City fold decades ago . The clinic provides routine exams and prescribes medication as needed , referrals for outside services needed , and assistance for those needing help finding governmental insurance assistance ( such as applications for Medicaid ) .
3 . Charitable Causes – The Boyne City community supports and maintains , through various organizations , charities to help those in need . These can be in the form of service organizations such as the Lions Club , which focuses on the blind and vision impaired , the Kiwanis Club , dedicated to children , and the Eta Nu Women 's Fraternity which is gearing up now for Dressed for Chill , which assists children in getting the winter gear they need .
Also included are membership organizations such as the Boyne City Eagles , which hosts a free-for-all Thanksgiving dinner each year and contributes financially to the area .
4. Business Development – Through grants supported by the Boyne City Administration and Main Street Program , local businesses have enjoyed a variety of opportunities to improve themselves , through community development block grants , payment in lieu of taxes programs , and façade improvements . Examples have included Boyne Country Provisions , Precision Edge , Stiggs Brewery , Subway , and more .
5 . Fantastic Events – Boyne City hosts a variety of events throughout the year for dozens of occasions . Local holidays are expanded through opportunities such as a massive Fourth of July Festival , open houses centered around the post-Thanksgiving Santa parade , and Chocolate-Covered Boyne near Valentine 's Day .
Additional chances to celebrate include periodic Business After Hours events to support networking among business owners , Earlier than the Bird each year to promote early ( think six in the morning ) shopping , and the Boyne Business Expo , which allows vendors and potential customers to connect in a large-scale fair-style atmosphere at Boyne Mountain .
6 . Projects – The top and most recent project is clearly the Boyne City Hall complex , which includes a brand-new set of offices for city administration , museum , and emergency services suite that encompasses the Boyne City Police , Fire , and EMS departments .
Also included is housing for the renovated clock and antique fire truck .
Other projects include the Boyne City Pavilion , which is currently under construction , various street and roadway improvements , a thorough volunteer-driven cleaning out of the playground following concerns of arsenic , and the current rental of the former Devlon Corporation site now known as the Boyne City Open Space .
7 . Safety – Many are proud of the safety of the Boyne Community . The police force boasts regular training opportunities , including vital active shooter training held at the Boyne City High School in recent years . The police force was among the first to introduce body cameras on their officers to allow better quality assurance as well as liability protection for their officers .
Also on the list of achievements include officers patrolling on bicycles , PBT 's offered at the station in City Hall , a new logo , and increased education culminating in Assistant Chief Kevin Spate completing a leadership training program .
8 . Education – Boyne City 's educational opportunities continue to expand , offering a variety of different experiences .
Concord Academy Boyne offers a smaller fine-arts focused education for students .
The larger Boyne City Public Schools recently completed improvements to their facilities , and are constantly integrating new programs . These include middle and high school bands , an award-winning visual imaging program , a newly restored industrial arts program , which boasts factory machinery donated by local industrial businesses , and a new optional fifth-year program allowing students wishing to stay an additional year to complete additional education with no added cost .
The school system also hosts award-winning culinary arts opportunities , trips abroad , and early childhood programs focused on getting younger children ready to begin their formal education .
Overall , Boyne City continues to grow , being one of the few towns to increase in population on the last census .
The trend to fix what 's not perfect and continue to improve what 's already working has kept Boyne City ahead of the times and the proverbial curve .
If the past eight years are any indication , Boyne City will continue to be a destination for people from all over the United States .

Preserving peaceful relations in an era of rapid shifts in relative power is tough , says Martin Wolf from the Financial Times .
NEW YORK : In the past half century , humanity has made extraordinary progress . This is unquestionable .
This consists of more than higher incomes . It consists also of longer and better lives . We know this has happened . We also know why . But achievements bring new challenges . These are no exception .

In the early 1970s , the average woman produced just under five children . Many prophets of doom warned of unmanageable population explosion .
Today , the global fertility rate is down to 2.4 . In China , it is well below replacement level . In Brazil , too , where the Catholic Church was deemed an overwhelming obstacle to birth control , it is also below replacement level .
Sub-Saharan Africa is the only big region where fertility rates remain high .
SMALLER FAMILIES , LONGER LIVES

Why are families so much smaller ? It is partly because wealthier people want fewer and better-educated children .
But perhaps still more it is because their children survive . In 1960 , 246 out of every 1,000 Indian children died before the age of five . By 2016 , this was 43 .
In Brazil , the child mortality rate has fallen from 171 in 1960 to 15 in 2016 . Even in rich Japan , it has fallen from 40 in 1960 ( today 's world average ) to three . We all love our children . So think what this transformation means to happiness .
Globally , life expectancy has jumped from 53 years in 1960 to 72 in 2016 .
China 's life expectancy is now 76 , the same as Japan 's in 1977 . Brazil 's is now the same as China 's . India 's is 69 . Even Nigeria 's life expectancy has risen from 37 in 1960 to 53 .
Being very old may not be much fun . Yet few regrets a long life .

EXTREME POVERTY
Then there is extreme poverty . That is currently measured by the World Bank as an income of below US $ 1.90 a day ( at 2011 purchasing power parity ) .
This is what the late Hans Rosling , the Swedish doctor and statistician who founded the marvellous data animation website , Gapminder.org , views as the lowest of the four “ levels ” of current material existence .
In 1800 , almost all people lived in such poverty . As recently as 1980 , 42 per cent of humanity still lived at this level . By 2013 , this was down to 11 per cent .
In China , the rate fell from 67 per cent in 1990 to 1 per cent in 2014 . This progress is astounding . When I joined the World Bank in the early 1970s , such advances against extreme poverty seemed almost inconceivable .
MORE DIMENSIONS OF PROGRESS
Rosling 's magnificent posthumous book , Factfulness , describes these and many other dimensions of progress . These include the spread of female education , improvements in the supply of clean water , the huge rise in the number of vaccinations and even the spread of democracy .
The book also helps us think more clearly about why we tend to be ( wrongly ) so pessimistic .
Another new book , Enlightenment Now by the experimental psychologist Steven Pinker , places the credit for these advances where it is due , in the best of the enlightenment project of reason , science and concern for human welfare .

UNFINISHED BUSINESS
Progress always leaves much unfinished business . That is true on all the above dimensions . It also creates new challenges .
Managing mass urbanisation is one . Another is the ability of disease to spread more quickly than before . We still struggle to contain the fragility of our financial system . But the biggest risks are surely those of global conflict and environmental disaster .
IS THE WEST LOSING IT ?
On the former , Kishore Mahbubani , a Singaporean expert on international relations , brings a compelling warning in his succinct new book , Has the West Lost It ? His fundamental messages are , first , that the West won , second , that it is now losing , and , finally , that the West must adapt .
The West has won because everybody realises that science and technology work and a growing number of societies have learnt to harness it .
The West is losing , as a direct result of this lesson , because the domination by an eighth of the world 's people is coming to an end .
The West must adapt because it has no sensible alternative . The lesson the West — above all , the US — must learn is , he insists , to interfere far less and co-operate far more . It can not run the world . It needs to stop its arrogant and usually foolish interventionism . It is hard to disagree with this advice from such a well-informed friend of the West .

MANAGING GLOBAL COMMONS
Preserving peaceful relations in an era of rapid shifts in relative power is a huge challenge . Yet so , too , is managing the global commons .
As humanity becomes richer , its impact on the global environment has hugely increased . The most potent indicator of this is the continuing rise in emissions of greenhouse gases .
But important problems also arise elsewhere , notably in the oceans , as a result of overfishing and destruction of habitats . Far too many people in rich countries think the answer is for the billions of poorer people to abandon hopes for a better life .
That is not just immoral : it is infeasible . Remember , not least , that the billion richest people consume more than half of all the fossil fuels we burn .
LESS UNEQUAL TODAY
The world is a far , far better place than it was . At the global level , it is even less unequal than it was four decades ago , because of the rapid rise in the average incomes of previously destitute countries .
But powerful countries in relative global decline resent their change in position . Countries that contain substantial populations in relative domestic decline are consumed by the politics of rage . Yet , if progress is to be sustained and the dangers are to be managed , peaceful co-operation is necessary .
The clever way for the West to achieve this , argues Mr Mahbubani , is to adhere to the multilateral rules and agreements they created ( such as the Paris accord on climate ) in order to encourage China to do the same . That is the opposite of what the US is now doing .
We have come far , and can come much further . But this will not happen automatically and may not happen at all .
Am I optimistic that the world will rise to the challenge ? The answer is : No .

Endpoint Security Automation A Top Priority for IT Professionals
July 2018 by SANS INSTITUTE
Global cybersecurity training company , the SANS Institute , today released its 2018 SANS Endpoint Security Survey report , which found that automating endpoint detection and response processes is the top priority for IT professionals trying to put actionable controls around their endpoints .
The survey questioned IT professionals globally on how they approach endpoint security within their organisations , with endpoints referring to devices connecting to networks such as desktop computers , employer-owned laptops , network devices , cloud-based systems and IoT devices .
“ The diversity and quantity of endpoints in the modern enterprise are driving the need for more automation and predictive capabilities , ” says survey author and SANS Analyst Lee Neely . “ While organisations are purchasing solutions to keep ahead of the emerging cyber threats , they appear to fall short on implementing the key purchased capabilities needed to protect and monitor the endpoint , ” Neely continues .
Forty-two percent of the IT professionals surveyed said their endpoints had been breached ; 82 % of that group said their breaches involved desktops , while 69 % cited corporate laptops and 42 % claimed involvement of employee-owned laptops ( 42 % ) , which are generally not well-covered in security programmes . The top threat vectors for these exploited endpoints were webbed drive-by ( 63 % ) , social engineering/phishing ( 53 % ) and ransomware ( 50 % ) .
However , while respondents are relying on the security capabilities they currently have to protect these endpoints , often those technologies are not fully implemented .
For example , 50 % have acquired next-gen antivirus but 37 % have not implemented the capabilities . Additionally , 49 % have malware-less attack detection capabilities , but 38 % of these have not implemented them . In some cases , it appears that , while respondent organisations were able to procure these types of newer technologies , they lacked the resources to implement them .
This gap in implementation indicates issues such as incomplete strategies , a leadership shortfall or a failure in project management related tools and processes . With 84 % of endpoint breaches including more than one endpoint , respondents have a vested interest in improving visibility , detection and response through more automated , integrated endpoint protection , detection and response technologies . Automating and integrating workload across the detection and response cycle is critical as endpoints of every type are under constant attack . Neely concludes that more automation enables the security operations centre ( SOC ) to stay abreast of endpoint-related threats , while addressing a major issue cited by respondents , that of a lack of staffing and resources to manage and monitor their many endpoint-related toolsets .

Washington : US President Donald Trump has signed legislation that would help people with deadly diseases try experimental treatments .
Trump signed the Right to Try bill on Wednesday . He called it a `` fundamental freedom '' that will provide hope and save lives .
The bill cleared the House last week following an emotional debate in which Republicans said it would help thousands of people in search of hope . Many Democrats said the measure was dangerous and would give patients false hope .
Trump embraced the plan during his State of the Union address , saying people who are terminally ill should n't have to leave the country to seek cures .
The measure gives people diagnosed with life-threatening conditions who have exhausted treatment options access to unproven drugs without needing permission from the Food and Drug Administration .

LONDON : Jermain Defoe scored two penalties as third-bottom Sunderland prevented Liverpool from significantly trimming Chelsea 's lead at the Premier League summit in a 2-2 draw on Monday ( Jan 2 ) .
Liverpool twice went ahead , through Daniel Sturridge and Sadio Mane , but Defoe 's two spot-kicks mean Chelsea will move eight points clear if they win at Tottenham Hotspur on Wednesday .
`` I am not able to explain it because I do n't know exactly what I saw , '' said Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp . `` My team were fighting , but I was n't sure if they could do it . ''
Manchester City lost ground after losing 1-0 at Liverpool on New Year 's Eve , but they bounced back by winning 2-1 at home to Burnley despite the first-half dismissal of Fernandinho .
Liverpool , who were denied a fifth successive league win , were left five points adrift of Chelsea in second place , with City two points back in third place .
Manchester United rose to within a point of the top four after goals by Juan Mata and Zlatan Ibrahimovic secured a contentious 2-0 win at 10-man West Ham United .
Klopp made just one change to his starting XI , Sturridge replacing the injured Jordan Henderson , and the England striker gave his side a 19th-minute lead at the Stadium of Light .
Dejan Lovren miscued his volley from a corner , but Sturridge reacted sharply to swivel and redirect the ball past Sunderland goalkeeper Vito Mannone with his head .
Defoe equalised six minutes later , netting his 10th league goal of the season from the penalty spot after Didier N'Dong was fouled by Ragnar Klavan .
Mane restored Liverpool 's lead in the 72nd minute , tapping in from a corner , but then conceded a penalty for a needless handball , allowing Defoe to equalise for the second time with six minutes to play .
`` There was no foul before the free-kick for the second penalty , '' Klopp added . `` You need a little bit of luck , but Sunderland worked hard too and maybe they deserved it . ''
Compounding Liverpool 's disappointment , Sturridge limped off late on and had to be helped to the tunnel at the full-time whistle .
GUARDIOLA TETCHY
Manchester United were given an early advantage at West Ham when Sofiane Feghouli was harshly sent off by referee Mike Dean in the 15th minute after a 50-50 with Phil Jones .
West Ham goalkeeper Darren Randolph produced a stunning save to claw Antonio Valencia 's shot off the line in the 36th minute , with Jesse Lingard 's follow-up hitting the post .
United manager Jose Mourinho sent on Mata and Marcus Rashford in the second half and they combined for the visitors ' 63rd-minute opener , Rashford teeing up Mata to sweep home .
Ibrahimovic smashed in his 18th United goal , despite being in an offside position , to seal a sixth straight league victory .
Manchester City lost Fernandinho to a straight red card in the 32nd minute against Burnley for flying in on Johann Berg Gudmundsson with both feet off the ground .
It was the Brazil midfielder 's third red card in six games and will earn him a four-game ban .
City manager Pep Guardiola turned to his bench at half-time , sending on Sergio Aguero and David Silva , and within 17 minutes of kick-off in the second half City were 2-0 up .
Left-back Gael Clichy broke the deadlock in the 58th minute , curling home with his weaker right foot , and four minutes later Aguero slammed home from a tight angle .
A blunder by Claudio Bravo allowed Ben Mee to reduce the arrears following a goalmouth scramble , but City held on to climb back into the Champions League places .
`` We won against a lot of circumstances in a tough game so we 're happy for that , '' Guardiola said in a tetchy BBC interview . Asked for his thoughts on Fernandinho , he replied : `` Ask the referee . ''
Substitute Enner Valencia , Leighton Baines and Romelu Lukaku scored in the last 17 minutes as seventh-place Everton overcame Southampton 3-0 at Goodison Park .
West Bromwich Albion remain a point below Everton in eighth after coming from behind to win 3-1 at home to second-bottom Hull City through goals from Chris Brunt , Gareth McAuley and James Morrison .
Champions Leicester City have now gone 12 league games without an away win following a drab 0-0 draw at Middlesbrough that left them six points above the relegation zone in 14th place .
English Premier League results :
Everton 3 Southampton 0
Manchester City 2 Burnley 1
Middlesbrough 0 Leicester 0
Sunderland 2 Liverpool 2

Furious 8 doubles US debut ; A Chinese Odyssey Part 2 : Cinderella in second place
The Fate Of The Furious has fully lived up to expectations , smashing multiple Chinese box office records for the three-day opening weekend ( $ 189.91m ) , which almost doubled its simultaneous North American debut , opening day ( $ 60.20m on Friday ) and single box office day ( first on Friday , again on Saturday with $ 69.36m ) .
The eighth instalment of Universal 's blockbuster franchise has also become the fastest to zoom past the RMB1 billion ( $ 145m ) benchmark in three days , breaking the previous record set by The Mermaid in four days .
Given Furious 8 's stunning performance , last week 's Chinese box office ( April 10-16 ) shot up by approximately 90 % week-on-week . What made it more extraordinary was the ticket sales were not fuelled by any public holidays , since Easter is generally not celebrated in China .

Other Confederate memorials in the area been targeted as well .
Hillsborough County commissioners voted on July 19 to remove a different monument in the county , this one in downtown Tampa and on county property , after several heated meetings filled with public discussion .
On Wednesday , the commission is scheduled to discuss the monument again with an update on the relocation .
TONAWANDA , N.Y. ( WIVB ) – A Tonawanda woman who pleaded guilty to stealing over $ 18,000 from a Tonawanda Elementary School was sentenced to three years probation and 200 hours of community service Friday .
Jennifer Seyfang , 38 , has admitted to stealing more than $ 18,000 from July 2016 to Sept. 2017 , while she was serving as PTA treasurer at Charles A. Lindberg Elementary .
Seyfang also admitted to attempting to take more than $ 9,500 from the Greater Buffalo Gymnastics Booster Club when she was a treasurer there .

Officials say she already paid back the money to the PTA .
ROME : Visitors to Rome 's Pantheon , one of the ancient world 's best preserved monuments , will have to pay an entry fee from next May unless they are going there to pray , Italy 's culture and tourism ministry said on Monday ( Dec 11 ) .
Now a church , the vast cylindrical former temple whose undamaged exterior wall supports a 43.3 metre-high dome with a circular skylight at its summit , drew 7.4 million visitors last year .
The new €2 ( US $ 2.36 ) per person charge is part of a drive to squeeze more profit from Italy 's cultural assets , and the ministry said tourist visits would also be suspended during religious services .
Part of the ticket revenue will be spent on maintaining the site , where Roman statesman Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa commissioned a temple in honour of Emperor Augustus in around 27 BC .
The Pantheon 's current form and six-metre thick walls date from the early part of the reign of Emperor Hadrian , who came to power in AD 117 . The building survived the Barbarian attacks on Rome and was transformed into a Christian church in 609 .
Among those buried in there are the Renaissance artist Raphael and two Italian kings .

Caring for art and architecture dating back thousands of years has long posed a challenge for a country that is responsible for more UNESCO world heritage sites than any other and has long-standing problems of bureaucracy and low public funding .
It 's about the course . From the starting line off the Balboa Pier to the breakwater off the Hotel Coral Marina in Ensenada is 125 nautical miles . Along the way are the Coronado Islands , and the skipper must choose to go either outside or inside those islands . Usually there is more breeze outside the islands , but sometimes an offshore breeze fills in after midnight and the inshore track may be more favored . Other years , sailing the rhumb line directly to the finish , and thereby sailing fewer miles , works best .
As 3 February 2018 marks the Queer Azadi Pride March in Mumbai , we 're publishing six compelling coming-out stories : first-person accounts of coming out about your sexuality or gender to friends , loved ones , colleagues or even to yourself . This interview was part of Harish Iyer 's ' I 'm Coming Out ' , published by Juggernaut Books , in which the personalities he speaks with explore what it means to be gay in India .
I met Praful Baweja during a particularly turbulent period in my professional life . He is one of the most vibrant , outspoken and expressive people I have ever met , and his energy is infectious . Praful not only gave me great advice but also helped launch my creative career . If not for him , I would perhaps still be struggling with self-esteem issues . But I did not know anything about his personal struggles until I started writing his story .
Praful grew up in a family of doctors , judges and engineers in a distant suburb of Mumbai . His was one of only two families that had a television in the entire neighbourhood . A short , gangly boy , he was the darling of the women in his building and often assisted them in their daily prayers . This helped him stay away from bullies on the playground who would often pick on him due to his tiny frame . But it was n't as though Praful did n't fight back . Once when he was 10-years-old , he bit the forearm of a 15-year-old who hit him for letting a currency note fly away .
As a child , Praful preferred the company of adults and often engaged with them in philosophical discussions . He would frequently go to the rooftop and spend hours looking at stars . He has always been a deeply spiritual person , and perhaps that is one of the reasons why he is able to reach out to people and help them . This was evident in the way he once spoke to young members of the LGBTQ community to get them to come together and form a photography society . I 've also seen it in him when he designs posters for gay pride parades or works on a brand campaign . Praful is deeply connected with what he does , and the universe .
Growing up , he was inspired by his older sister , who started working right out of school . Praful possesses a natural aptitude for languages and speaks half a dozen fluently . Shortly after school , he followed in his sister 's footsteps , using his skill for languages by taking up content writing assignments . He started travelling extensively and working longer hours once he joined college . This was also when he started discovering his sexuality . As expected , the first person he came out to was his sister , who was cool about it in the most un-Punjabi un-dramatic way .
`` That seems very easy-peasy , '' I said to Praful .
`` That was not so easy-peasy , '' he replied . `` I had my own struggles . I was also straight at one point . ''
`` Seriously ? '' I chuckled .
`` Yes . I mean I thought I was straight or bisexual . I even dated a girl… ''
To me Praful is so comfortable with his gay identity that I was shocked to learn he had confusions about his sexuality . That he too had gone through some sort of confusion during his growing-up years . When he was n't sure about his sexuality , he ended up dating a close female friend . But curiosity got the better of him and he started looking for information and joined online support groups . He got in touch with Gay Bombay – an online group – which broadened his knowledge and understanding of his own sexuality .
`` Ditto ! '' I told him . `` I also found a lot of support in online forums . Especially the Gay Bombay Yahoo group . '' The Gay Bombay Yahoo group is the biggest platform for the gay community in India .
He started reaching out to others like him and began communicating with them . He discussed his apprehensions and made every attempt to gain greater clarity . Knowing there were others like him not only gave Praful more confidence , but also encouraged him to help others deal with the first steps in the coming out process .
He realised that different forms of creative expression like designing , writing and even acting , helped him become calmer and find peace . As he was writing scripts for a TV show , he was cast in the role of a man of ambiguous sexuality with a mean streak . Praful , the self-confessed drama queen , nailed it and made the character memorable . He also dabbled in photography , tarot reading and reiki during this time .
Praful is a healer and a giver . In all his relationships , Praful has strived to be a friend before becoming a boyfriend . His love tales are more dramatic than any Bollywood masala film . Like all our romantic stories , his also have a pattern . His boyfriends have told him that he is lucky for them – when they begin dating him , a few unsettled matters in their lives , like getting a visa which had been pending for months , fell into place .
Praful had his first serious relationship when he was 22 years old . Despite the fact that he had met his boyfriend – a footballer – online without seeing him in person , Praful was in love .
`` Where 's he now ? '' I curiously asked Praful .
`` He had a non-malignant tumour . He died , '' Praful replied calmly .
Praful has not forgotten his first online boyfriend . But he has accepted his death .
After his first love affair , Praful took some time off the Internet . He then got into the event organising space with a leading publishing house . That was when he met his next love , who was roughly 15 years older than him .
`` He wanted commitment . I was only in my early 20s and was n't exactly up for that . ''
Though Praful has very fond memories of this grown-up man going down on his knees to propose to him , things did n't work out . He eventually migrated to the Middle East with a heart full of Praful .
After this affair , Praful 's next love story had an unconventional twist . He fell in love with his boss , who was mentoring Praful to follow in his footsteps . That relationship fizzled away .
When Praful was asked to go to Bangalore on a job induction programme , he took refuge in a fashion designer 's house . They fell in love almost immediately . Praful used to burn CDs for him , with one song for every day . They exchanged love notes and gifts quite regularly . Even though the designer always maintained that he was bisexual , Praful continued seeing him . After a while , the designer migrated to the UK . Praful was heartbroken . But he remained a fighter , so when he received an invitation to attend the wedding of his once-lover , he obliged . They continue to remain friends , though there exists a distance between the two .
Praful took a break from the drama of relationships for a while but soon fell in love yet again , this time with a third-year college student who proposed to Praful in what he describes as ‘ one of the funniest yet sweetest proposals ' he has received . They were both watching a film at Regal in Colaba , and during the interval , his date left the hall never to return . Later in the evening , Praful found in his bag a card professing love . His date had slipped it in and left . Praful still has it with him . However , this boy , too , left the country to move to Kuwait .
`` I am like a visa for my loves , '' Praful joked . Every time he has dated a person they 've ended up moving to another country ! Even the girl he had had a relationship right at the beginning when he was still confused about his sexuality . Almost all his relationships have been tinged with this tragic-comic aspect .
`` Praful , we should have dated , '' I said , `` I could have been in Canada now , close to Justin Trudeau . ''
Praful is truly a wonderful person , and that 's the reason this story almost reads like a love letter to him . But do not be fooled so easily by his casual demeanour . Praful also has a caustic tongue . He has many friends but is also disliked by some for his super witty and sometimes extremely sarcastic tone . Praful is not scared to call a spade a spade . He has rebuked me countless times when he thought I was not doing things right . On the other hand , he is generous with his compliments and has also encouraged me wholeheartedly . In fact , I made my first television debut with him on a show called Minus 30 on Network18 , which was anchored by Paras Tomar .
Praful speaks at several forums for the cause of LGBTIQ rights and plays an important part in the LGBTIQ movement in India . He does n't get written about as much as the others , but that should n't take away from his efforts . He is a silent warrior who does what he has to on the sidelines . And he is happy with that .
He is also a great mentor and guide . Today , many young gay men look up to Praful because of his kind and helpful nature . As a voracious reader , he encourages them to look at books and information as a source of support . He is someone who has encouraged several young men to take up artistic forms of expression in order to cope better with discovering and coming to terms with their sexuality . One such photography club he was associated with , QGraphy , became so hugely popular that its members are now regulars at all LGBT events in Mumbai .
Praful 's enterprising nature is what I respect the most about him . But oddly enough , for a man who is always there for others , Praful is yet to come out to his parents , and not for lack of trying . He has tried to broach the subject on multiple occasions , but his parents keep finding new and innovative ways to brush it under the carpet . Praful suspects it is probably because his older sister is unmarried and their parents do n't want to jeopardise her prospects by making Praful 's sexuality public . Also , though his parents have a fair idea of his sexuality , the fact that he has moved out of home to live independently seems to be a bigger reason for concern .
Praful is ‘ out and about ' when it comes his sexuality . All LGBTIQ people do n't have it that easy . `` What advice would you give those who are trying to understand their sexual orientation , those who are gay and are struggling to come out ? '' I asked Praful .
`` Sexuality is a part of life , '' he said . `` My sexuality is a part of my complete self . I ca n't take it out of me and treat it independently . So I would say first try and accept your sexuality . Before you want the world to accept it , tell yourself , ' I am bigger than my problems , and there is nothing more precious than me being happy . ' Everyone has internal struggles . Everyone hates some part of themselves . Try to win that fight . Be you . Unapologetically you . And always remember no one has the right to discriminate against you . You are not a brand . You are different , but so is everyone else . You are not going to get gay employed , you get employed . You are not a gay son , you are a son . So live it up . The complete you . ''
Make note of the name Etzanoa , a long-lost city . Donald Blakeslee says he 's found it .
The discovery could put south-central Kansas on the map as the second-biggest settlement of Native Americans found in the United States , Blakeslee said . And it 's now , finally , the known location of a 1601 battle pitting outnumbered Spaniards firing cannon into waves of attacking Indian warriors .
Etzanoa has remained a mystery for 400 years . Archaeologists could not find it . Historians thought reports of a permanent settlement with 20,000 Native Americans in it were exaggerated .
But here in Arkansas City , at the confluence of the Walnut and Arkansas Rivers , Blakeslee , an anthropologist and archaeologist at Wichita State University , has found evidence of a massive town stretching across thousands of acres of bluffs and rich bottomland along two rivers . What clinched it was the discovery , by a high school kid , of a half-inch iron cannonball .
He even found a still-functional water shrine , depicting communication with the spirit world , carved into a limestone boulder in Tami and Greg Norwood 's backyard .
It 's a good story , all true , Blakeslee said : A lost city , a forgotten mythology — and the story of the once-great Wichita Nation , decimated by European diseases , then pushed aside by American settlers and the United States Army .
Amazed by the size
With the discovery , Arkansas City leaders are hoping to turn their town into a tourist destination .
“ We always knew we once had a whole bunch of Indians living around here , because we had found way too many artifacts to think otherwise , ” said Jay Warren , an Arkansas City council member . “ But we had no idea until Dr. Blakeslee came along about how big it was . ”
Etzanoa might have been comparable in size to Cahokia , Blakeslee said . That alone should bring world attention .
The Cahokia Mounds State Historic Site in western Illinois , with its pyramid Monk 's Mound , is the biggest Native American urban complex ever built in the United States . It showcases the 14.4-acre mound that was the centerpiece of the ancient city , along with the outlines of the city , enclosed by fortress walls and filled with shrines of a powerful mythology and culture outside St. Louis .
Cahokia — the remnants of the largest pre-Columbian settlement north of Mexico — attracts 400,000 visitors a year , a fact that gets the attention of Arkansas Citians . If Etzanoa was bigger , “ and it might have been , ” that will rewrite American history , Blakeslee said .
“ The Spaniards were amazed by the size of Etzanoa , ” Blakeslee said . “ They counted 2,000 houses that could hold 10 people each . They said it would take two or three days to walk through it all . ”
But for four centuries , the story of a big Native American town in Kansas made no sense to historians .
When French explorers came in the 1700s , 100 years after the Spanish battle , they met only migratory bands of Kanza , Wichita , Pawnee , Kiowa , Cheyenne and Apache tribes .
So historians read the Spanish accounts and raised questions : If there were a permanent mega-site named Etzanoa , where was the huge accumulation of pottery shards ?
And where did those tens of thousands of people go ? Twenty thousand , as the Spaniards estimated in 1601 , is equivalent to modern-day Derby , Liberal or Hays .
And how could Plains hunters feed tens of thousands day after day ? Bison are dangerous . The Wichita had no horses and hunted on foot .
And where were the Spanish cannonballs , fired by outnumbered and terrified Spaniards ?
The battle
For years , Blakeslee , 73 , had read the accounts of soldiers who served under the Conquistador Juan de Onate , the founding governor of the colony of New Mexico . Onate 's soldiers said they fought a battle 60 years after Coronado , somewhere in the Great Plains .
The battle reports said Onate led 70 soldiers from New Mexico and found a vast town at the junction of two rivers .
Warriors on the outskirts threw dirt into the air as the Spanish approached , signaling they were ready to fight . “ The Rayados , ” Onate called the Wichitas — “ The striped ones , ” from the way they painted and tattooed their faces .
The Spaniards entered the town , and the Wichita fled , thousands evacuating to the north .
Onate sent armed patrols into the empty town .
What his soldiers saw unnerved them . They told Onate they 'd counted 2,000 big beehive-shaped homes — clusters of these homes surrounded by cornfields . Nervous about the size of the place , they turned around . Indians told them later that the settlement extended for miles past where the Spaniards stopped , meaning the true population might have been higher than the 20,000 Spanish estimates .
Onate turned his men south — and came face to face with hundreds of warriors , firing arrows and charging at Onate 's small Spanish troop .
The attackers were Escanxaques , a tribe enemy to the Wichita . They had come to attack Etzanoa — and now attacked the Spanish .
Sixty of the 70 Spaniards were wounded . Their four cannons saved them , clusters of iron bullets fired from cannon-like shotgun blasts , whistling into trees and boulders . The Escanxaques , stunned , regrouped in a rock-lined ravine , but then charged repeatedly uphill to attack before finally backing off .
Cannonballs confirm
It was a high school kid , Adam Ziegler , who made the link that cinched the verification of Etzanoa .
Blakeslee says artifacts he and Ziegler found in the past two years show the old stories were true , and that between the years 1450 and 1700 , at least 20,000 ancestors of today 's Wichita Nation thrived in and near what is now Arkansas City .
Blakeslee realized the confluence of the Walnut and Arkansas rivers could be the one described by the Spanish . He found traces of houses and granaries . He 's walked over much of Arkansas City and saw that the ravines and bluffs fit the Spanish accounts .
After locals like Hap McCleod told him people had been digging up “ literally tons ” of flint tools and clay pottery shards for generations , Blakeslee dug up his own shards , flint arrowheads , knife blades , hide-scrapers and awls .
Two years ago he found a rock-lined ravine in McLeod 's backyard that matched the Spanish account of where the Escanxaques regrouped under fire to attack . He took a metal detector there , along with Ziegler , a Lawrence Free-State High School freshman .
“ They could n't find anything that day , ” Ziegler recalled . “ Dr . Blakeslee said I could use his metal detector . An hour or two later , I found the little ball , buried four inches deep . ”
Blakeslee found two more Spanish cannonballs .
That did it , Blakeslee said . The old story was true .
Tough beyond belief
Blakeslee says the Wichita were wronged by fate , disease epidemics and war . He 's going to try to set right what he can .
Smallpox and other illnesses killed probably tens of thousands after 1600 , he said .
War and relocation forced survivors to Oklahoma reservations . The tribe lost most of its culture . The tribe 's last fluent speaker of the Wichita language , Doris McLemore , died last year .
The Wichita were organized , cultured — “ and tough almost beyond belief , ” he said .
They and their Wichita cousins in Quivira , in Rice County , built a trade network with ancestors of the Pueblo Indians in New Mexico . They strapped 50-pound packages of dried meat and hides to themselves and their pack dogs , and walked 550 miles to the Pueblos . They 'd then walk back , bringing home cotton fabric , obsidian and turquoise .
They had no horses . The women and children likely helped hunt bison , Blakeslee said , forming lines and waving hide blankets while driving bison toward warriors carrying bows and arrows . “ Think of the courage that took , ” Blakeslee said .
They cultivated beans , maize ( corn ) , pumpkin and squash . They slaughtered bison meat and hides on an industrial scale . The men likely scouted , walking miles a day , shadowing herds . The women used flint hide-scrapers to thin down bison hides . “ From doing that all day , they probably had the toughest fists , ” Blakeslee said . “ You 'd never want to get in a fistfight with a Wichita woman . ”
Intrigue , concern
Modern-day Wichitas number about 3,000 , based now in Anadarko , Okla. , said Gary McAdams , who has held several leadership positions with the Wichita and Affiliated Tribes .
The Wichita are intrigued — and concerned — by what might come next , McAdams said . Blakeslee has consulted with them for years , telling what he 's found , inviting them to visit sites at Arkansas City and at the 160-foot-long serpent symbol still visible in the pasture grass in Rice County . Wichitas have helped on some of his digs .
“ We would have some concern about how they go about developing their thinking about Etzanoa as a tourist center , ” McAdams said . “ We are supportive of any respectful endeavor they want to pursue there — but would want to provide our input . ”
Jay Warren , a city council member , says the town will explore development .
Cahokia , in Illinois , attracts 400,000 visitors a year , but mostly because of how striking the 100-foot-tall Monk 's Mound looks , and because it 's located next to St. Louis and Interstate 70 .
Arkansas City , in contrast , has pastureland .
But Civil War battlefields do n't have a Monk 's Mound either , Warren said . “ And yet they attract thousands of visitors by doing a great job with walking trails and signs that explain step-by-step what was going on . ”
If Arkansas City with its 12,000 people could attract 20,000 students , archaeologists and tourists a year , it would give the city a boost , said McLeod , in whose backyard Adam Ziegler found that cannonball . McLeod now runs the Etzanoa Conservancy , and has worked for two years to polish ideas . “ We 're really proud that all this history happened here , and we want to share it with the world , ” he said .
“ We 're not talking about putting together a one-day wonder , ” Warren said . “ We 're looking at creating something that could be great for the region , and for 50 years and more down the road . We 're talking with ( Unified School District ) 470 about how it could enhance education . And we think the site could also be a hands-on field training facility for archaeologists from all over the world . ”
They could build an interactive visitor center , he said . They could build reconstructions of the grass houses and granaries the Wichita used . They could employ flint-knappers who could show how skilled craftsmen made arrowheads and knife blades .
Etzanoa would have been beautiful , McLeod said . The river bluffs south of Arkansas City look like picture postcards . The bluffs and hills pour out clear spring water from dells and nooks .
McLeod drove up recently to the tallest point in Arkansas City — where the city 's golf course clubhouse sits .
Blakeslee had told him that 's where Caratax , the Wichita chief in 1601 , probably kept his home .
“ You can see 360 degrees in any direction from here , ” McLeod said .
“ And it 's all beautiful . ”
Chhabria asked consumer attorneys who negotiated the deal to file additional paperwork that will delay approval until at least Monday . The filings will include an oversight mechanism to ensure the settlement is fully enforced before plaintiffs ' attorneys receive their $ 21-million portion . There also may be a bond requirement for appeals to deter “ serial objectors ” from trying to block the settlement .
Carlo Ancelotti is set to be given the job of reviving the fortunes of Italy 's national team , according to reports on Tuesday.Ancelotti , who was sacked by Bayern Munich last September , met with Italian Football Federation ( FIGC ) commissioner Roberto Fabbricini and sub-commissioner Alessandro Costacurta in a Rome hotel on Monday , Corriere dello Sport reported.And Sky Sport Italia said the 58-year-old has been offered a two-year position , which is likely to be less lucrative than his previous contract with the German champions.Italy have been without a permanent coach since Gian Piero Ventura was sacked after they failed to qualify for the World Cup for the first time in 60 years following defeat by Sweden in a two-legged playoff in November.Ancelotti , who has also managed Chelsea , Real Madrid and Juventus , has three Champions League titles to his name as a coach . He has also won the league in Italy , France , Germany and England.The FIGC budget for a new coach and his staff is five million euros ( $ 6.1 million ) per year , which would be a big drop from what Ancelotti earned at Bayern Munich.Costacurta is reported to have offered Ancelotti , who has also been linked with former club Chelsea and the soon-to-be-vacant job at Arsenal , a free hand in choosing his staff.Ancelotti 's son Davide , who was his assistant at Bayern , could play a role as well as former stars such as Andrea Pirlo , Gianluigi Buffon and Paolo Maldini.Costacurta , who was appointed to find a successor to Ventura , set a dateline of May 20 for the appointment of a new coach.Among the other names touted were Zenit St Petersburg coach Roberto Mancini , Chelsea boss Antonio Conte and former Leicester coach Claudio Ranieri , now in charge of French club Nantes.Italy Under-21 coach Di Biagio , 46 , has been holding the position on an interim basis.ea/gj

Wed , Jun 14 : Staff Sergeant Cory Dayley of the Calgary Police Service Cyber/Forensics Unit says whether criminal or not the actions of the “ CanadaCreep ” Twitter account is disturbing .
The Daily has a proud history of speaking truth to power . Now in our last issue of the semester , we , the managing board , can only hope that we 've upheld that legacy to the best of our ability .
The Daily talked to Anita Posadas , who had been injured on the job and mistreated by Cushman & Wakefield ( C & W ) Services . Posadas bravely stood up and shared her story . Posadas shined a light on the mistreatment of workers , confirming many fears that facilities workers are treated as second-class members of Tufts ' community .
In an effort to keep up with the ever-changing face of journalism , we have increased the number of stories that we broke online , rather than relying on a print schedule and following rules to obtain a minimum number of stories . This was especially evident in the numerous community messages regarding Greek life sanctions this semester ; rules can be a good thing but can also stifle creativity and timeliness . We can be lost in the monotony of production and miss the fact that a story should be visible before the next morning .
We also faced down an individual we never expected to , Anthony Scaramucci . Most students do n't expect to spend their trip home for Thanksgiving reading a cease-and-desist letter from a lawyer retained by a former White House communications director , but after consulting with the Student Press Law Center and double-checking the facts , we firmly stood by the words we published in voicing our support for a free press . From this experience , the biggest takeaways were a reminder that public figures , such as Scaramucci , can not easily claim libel , and if you can clearly articulate your argument in why you published a piece , people will support your efforts .
We are not so arrogant as to believe that we did n't make mistakes this semester , but in the case of the statements to which Scaramucci objected , we know ourselves to be in the right , and we will not quietly cease and desist as he wanted . We faced a gargantuan opponent whose checkbook could 've easily buried us , but we refused to be buried .
ICC Champions Trophy 2017 , Bangladesh vs India Match Prediction : Who will win today 's match
India start favourites , but Bangladesh will surely not be pushovers .
@ shanky11173 by Shankar Narayan Opinion 14 Jun 2017 , 12:06 IST
Kohli and Mortaza will hope their boys are on top of their game on Thursday
Prior to the start of the 2017 Champions Trophy , not many would have predicted the semi-final line-up that we have in store on Thursday . India were favourites to progress this far in the eyes of many , but few predicted their semi-final opponents to come as far as they have .
After losing the first match of the competition to England , Bangladesh had the uphill task of beating both Australia and New Zealand to enter the final four stage . While the game against Australia did not get a result , the match against New Zealand saw a spirited group of men lifts their game when it mattered the most .
Struggling at 33 for 4 and needing 267 for a win , the pair of Mahmadullah Riyad and Shakib-Al-Hasan put on 224 runs for the fifth wicket to ensure the 2015 World Cup quarterfinalists moved a step closer to the semifinals .
The dream became a reality the following day , when England defeated Australia , thereby ensuring it was The Tigers who joined the hosts of the competition in the next stage of the tournament .

India , on the other hand , will head into the contest on the back of a clinical win over South Africa on Sunday , where it was the bowlers who won the game , delivering on what was a pretty decent wicket for batting .
Not to forget the fielding , who many felt was the weakest element in India 's win over Pakistan in their first Group match . But against South Africa , India 's fielding proved to be the difference as three run-outs at vital junctures pegged the South Africans back .
In the three 50-over matches that the teams have featured in major events , India has triumphed twice while Bangladesh has won once , way back in 2007 . Can they pull off an upset on Thursday or will India prove to be good and march their way into a second consecutive final ?

Ariane Skeggs , who moved to Bakersfield , California from Perth , Australia eight years ago , has verbally committed to swim for Boise State University in the fall of 2018 .
“ I am so excited to announce my commitment to Boise State University Swim and Dive . I chose Boise State because it felt like home . The team and Coaches Kipp , Meghan and Brandon were so warm and welcoming , and their work ethic and goals fit with my own . Boise State University is a good academic fit for me , and I am looking forward to being part of the Bronco family . GO BRONCOS ! ”
Although Skeggs is originally from Australia , she did n't pick up swimming until moving to the United States ; previously she had been a competitive gymnast . Just before her freshman year at Frontier High School she began to take swimming seriously , and by the time high school season had reached its conclusion in May , Skeggs had won two individual titles at League Championship , then gone on to place third in the 500 free and eighth in the 200 free at 2015 CIF-Central Section Division I Championships . As a sophomore she finished third in both the 200/500 freestyles , and this past season she was runner-up in the 200 free ( 1:51.84 ) and third in the 500 free ( 5:04.93 ) . Skeggs qualified for the 2017 California State Meet in the 200 free ; she finished 22nd in prelims .
In club swimming , Skeggs represents Roadrunner Aquatics and specializes in the whole range of freestyle events . She swam the 50 through the 800 at California/Nevada Sectionals this summer , then added the 100/200 fly to her repertoire two weeks later at Western Zones Senior Championships . She finished long course season with new times in the 100/200/400/800/1500 free and 100/200 fly . Her best SCY times include :
SCY times :
1650 free – 17:22.32
1000 free – 10:23.77
500 free – 5:02.97
200 free – 1:51.84
100 free – 52.30
50 free – 24.74
Skeggs will suit up for the Broncos next fall with fellow verbal commit Lauren Vitort .

THE Lihou Charitable Trust is appealing to cyclists not to ride on the causeway as calls are made for the restrictions to be reviewed .
A reminder was posted on the trust 's Facebook page after a picture appeared online of riders on the causeway .
It created some debate with a few commenters , including Guernsey Bicycle Group chair Sam Field , calling for the rules to possibly be reconsidered .
Restrictions for cyclists and vehicles have been in place for 20 years with small signs on either side of the causeway .
The trust said cycling was not permitted because of the possible damage caused to island and wildlife .
After years of wait , India will finally stage a big ticket cue sports league in August . Here 's a look at what to expect , Snooker was born in India in the early 19th Century as a young British Army Lieutenant , Neville Chamberlain invented the sport while experimenting with the classic game of black pool . He added multi colored balls to the existing 15 red and black balls in his barrack in the small town of Jabalpur in MP and experimented with the game only to give birth to a copletely new format of Cue Sport called Snooker ! . Though the rules of the game were evolved much later when Chamberlain shifted his base to Ooty and he formulated the points system as well as fixed the rules of the game.While he developed this new format of Cue Sport at the prestigious Ooty Club , which was popularly termed `` Snooty Ooty '' for its exclusivity , the game founds its name , Snooker from here as well . What started off as an experiment soon become the most popular games to be played among the British Soldiers in India . And over the time Cue Sports have close to 2.5 million estimated amateur players in India currently.- 42 World Titles over the Years- Asia Games ( 4 editions ) - 5 Gold I 4 Silver I 6 Bronze Medals-1 Padma Bhushan Awardee-3 Padma Shri Awardees-2 Rajiv Ghandhi Khel Ratna Awardess-4 Dronacharya Awardees-13 Arjuna Awardees-1 Dhyan Chand AwardeeIndian Cue Masters League in association with Billiards and Snookers Federation of India ( BSFI ) is organized by SportsLive Entertainment , who are also the official license holders of the Premier Badminton League ( PBL ) , have acquired long-term rights for Cue Slam .

Thousands of people were evacuated in North Carolina amid mudslides and flooding as Alberto , now a tropical depression , continued its sodden march into the American heartland on Wednesday .
The storm drove pounding rains across a swath of the nation stretching from Alabama to the Great Lakes . Much of the region was already soggy from one of the wettest Mays on record .
In North Carolina , 2,000 people were evacuated for several hours after McDowell County emergency management officials announced that the Lake Tahoma
Dam faced `` imminent failure . '' The mandatory order , which came following localized mudslides triggered by the drenching rains , were ordered pending inspections .
An all-clear was announced about 10 hours later .
`` The emergency at Lake Tahoma has been canceled , '' the county said in a statement . `` The engineer has performed a safety inspection and determined that the evacuation order is no longer needed . ''

Asheville has received 13.26 inches of rain so far this month , making it the city 's wettest May on record by more than 4 inches , AccuWeather reported .
`` A normal May would be 3.66 inches , so you are talking about almost 10 inches more than normal , '' senior meteorologist Paul Walker said . `` And it continues to rain . ''
Two people were rescued after a mudslide pushed a state Department of Transportation truck into the Catawba River in McDowell County .
`` To illustrate the power of water , about 10 feet of rushing water pushed the 33,000-pound truck more than 1,000 feet downriver , '' the department warned .
Some spots across western portions of the Carolinas have seen more than 20 inches in just the past two weeks , the National Weather Service said . Two television station employees of WYFF in Greenville , S.C. , were killed Monday when a tree fell on their vehicle as they covered the storm in Polk County , N.C .

Alberto , the first named storm of a hurricane season that wo n't officially start until Friday , made landfall Monday west of Panama City on Florida 's Gulf Coast , delivering heavy rains , surging seas and winds of 45 mph .
The winds have died down , but the rain has continued to plague much of the South . Heavy rains continued to fall in parts of Alabama on Wednesday . But better times are coming , Walker said .
`` The very soupy air that has stretched from the Western Caribbean across a half to a third of the U.S. for the last week to 10 days is starting to break up , '' Walker said . `` Things should improve in the next few days . ''

Britain 's counter-terrorism chief said on Wednesday that two people who are critically ill in hospital in Wiltshire were exposed to the Novichok nerve agent , the same toxin that was used in an attack on ex-Russian spy Sergei Skripal .
Neil Basu said there was nothing in the background of the pair to suggest they would be a target . He also told reporters police did not yet know how the Novichok nerve agent was transmitted .
The man and woman , both British and in their 40s , were found in critical condition at a house in Amesbury on Saturday , 13 kilometers ( eight miles ) from Salisbury where Skripal and his daughter were poisoned with nerve agent on March 4 .
England 's Chief Medical Officer Sally Davies said Wednesday the risk to the general public remains low despite the incident .
Medical officials said people who had been in the area where the couple had been should take precautions and wash their clothes .
Police cordoned off places the two people visited before falling ill , but public health officials say there is not believed to be a wider risk . They were hospitalized Saturday and authorities at first believed they might have taken a contaminated batch of heroin or crack cocaine .
`` Further testing is now ongoing to establish the substance which led to these patients becoming ill and we are keeping an open mind as to the circumstances surrounding this incident , '' police said . `` At this stage it is not yet clear if a crime has been committed . ''
A major incident is a designation allowing British authorities to mobilize more than one emergency agency .
Britain accuses Russia of poisoning the Skripals with a Novichok nerve agent , a group of chemical weapons developed by the Soviet Union during the Cold War . Moscow denies the allegation . The poisoning sparked a Cold War-style diplomatic crisis between Russia and the West , including the expulsion of hundreds of diplomats from both sides .
Counter-terrorism teams from London 's Metropolitan Police were called in to help local forces in Wiltshire at the time of the Skripal poisoning . On Wednesday , however , Scotland Yard referred media calls to the Wiltshire police .
The statement from Wiltshire Police came only a month after police from 40 departments in England and Wales returned home after months of working on the Skripals ' poisoning . The Wiltshire Police force spent about 7.5 million pounds ( $ 10 million ) dealing with the aftermath of the Skripals ' poisoning and believe that his front door was contaminated with the nerve agent .
Sergei Skripal , 66 , is a former Russian intelligence officer who was convicted of spying for Britain before coming to the U.K. as part of a 2010 prisoner swap . He had been living quietly in Salisbury , a cathedral city located 90 miles ( 145 kilometers ) southwest of London , when he was struck down along with his 33-year-old daughter Yulia .
After being found unconscious in the street , the two spent weeks in critical condition at the hospital . Doctors who treated the Skripals said at the time said they expected them to die . They say they still do n't know what their long-term prognosis is .
The Skripals have been taken to an undisclosed location for their protection .

SYDNEY : Passengers on board domestic Qantas flights will soon be able to watch TV programmes and films , listen to their favourite songs and enjoy live sport - all on-demand .
The Austrlian airline on Wednesday ( Feb 15 ) announced that free access to the normally paid subscription-based Netflix , Spotify and Foxtel would be available in 2017 on board Wi-Fi enabled domestic flights .
Travellers will also be able to retain free access to these services after they disembark , with Foxtel offering three days of free access to its app and Netflix and Spotify offering 30-day free trials ( though customers will have to sign up to a subscription first ) .
In its press release , Qantas said it would offer video and audio streaming when its new satellite service - which it claims is up to 10 times faster than conventional inflight Wi-Fi - is switched on on its first domestic aircraft in late February this year . The rest of the airline 's fleet of domestic Boeing 737 and Airbus A330 aircraft will follow from mid-2017 onwards .
The airline said the new services would give passengers `` no shortage of entertainment '' .
“ We know that email , online shopping and general web browsing will be popular uses when we switch on Wi-Fi , but what a lot of people relish about flying is being able to catch up on their favourite TV shows or watch movies they did n't get to see at the cinema , ” said Qantas Group Executive of Brand , Marketing and Corporate Affairs , Olivia Wirth .
“ Foxtel and Netflix both have huge catalogues that are expanding all the time , so there will be no shortage of entertainment on board , '' she added .
“ The usage data from the collection of albums we already have on our aircraft shows that music is a great way for passengers to relax as they watch the world fly by . Spotify will open this up so you can listen to virtually any song you like . ''
Qantas added in its statement that it is also currently in talks with suppliers to extend Wi-Fi services onto its international and regional ( QantasLink ) fleets to `` develop a product that can overcome a number of technical , performance and coverage challenges , including options for Wi-Fi over large stretches over water '' .
The environment is one of the biggest issues in this modern world and it might seem to be a global-scaled issue , however , it is definitely affecting our health and lifestyle to a great extent . so for this week , I would like to explore in what ways that individuals can be aware of the effect of the environment at an individual level and together with my interests in wearable technology , I would like to see how wearable facilitates and expresses the environmental data .
aims for this week
* build a wearable device that measures air quality , dust , and UV index * interpret the data from sensors to kinetic wearable art
Human.meter is a wearable device that measures air quality , dust and UV index and interprets its data to kinetic wearable art . The aim of human.meter is not to provide a precise data , however , to allow an individual to perceive an information at individual aspect and to raise their environmental awareness and hopefully , to shape their daily activities .
Air quality sensor ( MQ135 ) is used to detect a wide range of gases , including NH3 , NOx , alcohol , benzene , sulfur , smoke , CO2 and other harmful gasses . the value of the sensor is not that precise but it still gives us some ideas .
The idea of the wearable kinetic art is from hermit crab as they cover their body from the environment , therefore , I use this to be a metaphor to imply and provoke wearer and audience to get the message that we should cover ourselves from a bad environment . To do so , the mask and the hood will be moving according to the air quality , dust and UV index .
a diagram that shows how the mask and the hood moving according to air quality , dust and UV index .
Two servos are attached to the mask and the hood to make it rotate according to the value from sensors .
From this prototype , I see a potential of using human with wearable as a movable installation where the real-time data is shown . It could be more than just serve the individual aspect , but there is potential to take this to the social and city aspect , for example , we could do a campaign where each participant will be in different places through London and get different data according to their locations . In this way , it can raise or provoke conversations about the environment and hopefully the solution of the environmental issue will be discussed .
First LACMA 's Urban Light installation went “ green ” with energy-saving LED bulbs . Now Ray 's and Stark Bar has a new menu and practices focused on the environment and animal welfare .
Ray 's executive chef Fernando Darin , who 's been at the helm since early 2016 , embraced a more plant-based diet a few years ago ( he still eats meat ) , and he sees the changes as a natural extension of that .
“ I started to think about ingredients … and animals with a little bit more care , ” Darin says .
One reason that Shania 's new album has taken so long is because since the release of Up ! , she divorced her husband — who was also her producer and main collaborator — and struggled with dysphonia , an ailment that made it nearly impossible to sing . All that upheaval in her personal life slowed her down , which is why she was n't prepared when the Purple One contacted her .
“ The very first producer that called me , who reached out to me before I 'd even written the album — I was writing all the time but I had n't started writing for the album…I get a call from Prince , ” Shania told reporters in Nashville this week .
“ And Prince and I — we had a few conversations , we emailed each other , ” she added . “ We exchanged [ notes ] on email for…months . ”
Ultimately , Shania admits she let the opportunity pass her by .
“ When he was calling me and mailing me , I was n't ready to do the album , ” she revealed . “ He said , ‘ Come to my studio , let 's get started , ' and I just said , ‘ I ca n't sing right now , I just do n't have my voice yet . ' And I never did it . ”
When she finally was ready , Shania says , Prince was on tour , and they never reconnected . Now , of course , with the Rock and Roll Hall of Famer 's death , the collaboration will never happen .
Says Shania , “ It 's like , if I ever had , you know , professional regret , that is definitely one of them . ”
Shania releases her new single “ Life 's About to Get Good ” today .

‘ Bizarre ' : Arizona woman , 92 , shoots 72-year-old son to death , police say
A 92-year-old woman shot and killed her 72-year-old son because he wanted to put her in an assisted living facility , according to the Maricopa County Sheriff 's Office . In what MCSO described as a “ bizarre turn of events , ” Anna Mae Blessing is facing one charge each of first-degree murder , aggravated assault with a deadly weapon and kidnapping , reports CBS Phoenix affiliate KPHO-TV .
Deputies were called out to Fountain Hills about 10 a.m. Monday .
Blessing had been living with her son , Thomas Blessing , and his girlfriend in the girlfriend 's condo . They moved her in about six months ago from out of state .
“ According to statements provided by suspect Blessing and received by the detectives , she had been contemplating for several days her son 's intentions to place her in an assisted living facility , ” explained a news release from MCSO . “ Blessing retrieved two pistols and concealed them in the pockets of her robe , then confronted her son in his bedroom . ”
MCSO said she shot her son twice before turning the gun on his 57-year-old girlfriend .
While struggling with that woman , whose name has not been released , Blessing lost her grip on the gun . But she still had the second one .
“ Blessing retrieved the second handgun and attempted to point it at the girlfriend , who knocked it from Blessing 's possession , ” according to MCSO .
The girlfriend called 911 . When deputies arrived , they ordered Blessing to come outside but were met with silence . They found her sitting in her reclining chair , her son deceased in a bedroom .
“ As the suspect was being escorted from the residence , she made a spontaneous statement to the effect of ‘ You took my life , so I 'm taking yours , ” ‘ court documents read . ”
It was later determined during an interview with the suspect that she believed her life was being taken as a result of her son and his girlfriend attempting to place her into an assisted living facility , police said .
According to the probable cause for arrest statement , Blessing “ intended to kill herself , however she did n't possess any additional firearms . ”
In speaking with Blessing , investigators learned that she had owned the two guns — a revolver and a .25 caliber pistol — since the 1970s . The first , she said , she bought at a gun store ; the second was given to her by her husband before he died . She also told deputies the last time she fired either of the weapons was in the '70s .
The suspect stated she stored the two handguns on the floor under a shelf in her bedroom .
When Blessing was asked what she thinks should happen to her , she replied she should be “ put to sleep ” as a result of her actions .
“ This is definitely an odd one , ” MCSO Sgt . Bryant Vanegas told Arizona 's Family . “ There are a lot of circumstances surrounding it , of course , but it 's definitely something you do n't see every day and it 's very unfortunate that this took place . ”
“ It is always concerning when domestic issues escalate to violence or tragic outcomes , ” Sheriff Paul Penzone said in a statement . “ They are often isolated and neither predictable nor preventable . ”
According to court documents , there was a history of domestic violence between Blessing and Thomas , including at least one incident in which police responded .
Blessing is still in jail , held on a $ 500,000 cash bond .

PITTSFORD , N.Y. ( AP ) — Jordan Matthews ' first chance to fill Sammy Watkins ' starting job with the Buffalo Bills ended with the newly acquired receiver sustaining a chest injury .
Matthews finished the two-hour practice on Sunday before being escorted off the field by a trainer . The Bills were unable to provide an update on the nature or severity of the injury because Matthews was still being evaluated .
It 's unclear when Matthews might have been hurt , though he did fall hard along the sideline while attempting to make a leaping catch in one-on-one coverage with cornerback Shareece Wright during a team drill .
It was not the type of debut the Bills were counting upon in returning to training camp since completing two blockbuster trades on Friday .
Buffalo gave up starting cornerback Ronald Darby to acquire Matthews and a third-round draft pick from Philadelphia . The deal coincided with Buffalo trading Watkins to the Los Angeles Rams for cornerback E.J . Gaines and a second-round pick .
As important as acquiring the two picks were for a team looking ahead to rebuilding through the draft , Matthewswas a key addition in addressing Buffalo 's more immediate needs .
Though not considered as dynamic of a deep threat as Watkins , Matthews has been consistent in his first three seasons with the Eagles . He was Philadelphia 's most productive receiver with 2,673 yards and 19 touchdowns , and became just the fifth NFL player to top 65 catches and 800 yards in each of his first three seasons .
Matthews saw playing time with both the first- and second-string offenses among what 's now become an entirely retooled group of receivers , including Anquan Boldin who signed last week .
Before practice , coach Sean McDermott was already projecting seeing both Matthews and Gaines play in a preseason game at Philadelphia on Thursday .
Gaines was surprised in learning of the trade , and welcomed the chance to prove himself after the Rams deemed him expendable .
“ Just being somewhere that I feel wanted , ” Gaines said following practice . “ Being somewhere that I feel like expects me to come in and make plays and knows what I can do on the football field , I 'm just excited . ”
A sixth-round pick out of Missouri , Gaines won the starting job as a rookie in 2014 , before missing the next season with a foot injury . He started 10 games last season before his job security was placed in question after the Rams acquired Kayvon Webster in the offseason .
In Buffalo , he 'll compete with Wright , first-round draft pick Tre'Davious White and Kevon Seymour for the two starting jobs on what will be a completely revamped secondary following Darby 's departure . Buffalo also features two new starting safeties in free-agent additions Micah Hyde and Jordan Poyer .
In other developments , McDermott continued expressing concern with starting left tackle Cordy Glenn missing practice due to a sore left foot that has bothered him the entire offseason .
Without going into detail , McDermott would only say , “ we 're hopeful , ” when asked if Glenn will be ready for the start of the season . He also acknowledged the team will have to develop a contingency plan in the event Glenn is n't ready .
Backup Seantrel Henderson wo n't be available because he will miss the first five games to complete serving a 10-game suspension issued last year for violating the NFL 's substance abuse policy . That leaves third-year player Michael Ola and rookie third-round draft pick Dion Dawkins competing for the primary backup spot .
Glenn was held out of Buffalo 's preseason-opening 17-10 loss to Minnesota and did not practice the following day . He also missed two practices 10 days ago after traveling to Charlotte , North Carolina , to have his foot examined by a specialist .
NOTES : Safety Colt Anderson was cleared for practice and activated from the physically unable to perform list because of a foot injury . … Rookie QB Nathan Peterman was rewarded for his preseason game performance by practicing with the second-string offense ahead of veteran backup T.J. Yates . Though crediting Peterman for going 13 of 25 for 112 yards and a TD against the Vikings , McDermott said he 's still evaluating as to whether to change the depth chart .
The fourth annual “ Billy ” golf tournament will be held on Sunday , Sept. 17 , at the Orchards Golf Course in Milford in memory of Bill Romatzick , a lifelong Stratford resident who passed away suddenly in March of 2014 .
“ The Billy ” tournament is organized by Bill 's longtime friend Bob Black . Friends and family have come out to play golf each year to honor and remember his life and his friendship . Bill was involved in several youth organizations in town including the YMCA Indian Guides , Stratford PAL Rifle Club and the Bunnell Bulldog Club . More than $ 7,000 has been raised during the tournaments and has been donated to the American Heart Association .
Cost to play in the tournament is $ 35 per golfer and all proceeds will be donated to the AHA . Trophies will be awarded to the 1st , 2nd and 3rd place teams and there will be raffles and refreshments .
To participate in the tournament , email Bob at [ email protected ] or call 203-556-1047 for reservations by Aug. 27 .
A New Canaan mother was arrested after she allegedly left her 11-week-old baby inside a hot car for near 50 minutes while she ran errands , according to police .
According to the arrest warrant , 34-year-old Kathryn Ferguson called 911 on July 18 reporting that she 'd left her child inside the car for about 10 minutes while she ran errands , and now the child was crying .
Police and an EMT responded to 81 Elm Street and found Ferguson sitting in her car holding the child in her arms . According to the warrant , Ferguson told police that she had left the child alone in the car for around 10 minutes while she purchased shoes and a drink from two nearby businesses . Later at the hospital , Ferguson told a social worker that she forgot the child because the baby had been asleep and quiet in the back seat , the warrant states .
The child was evaluated at Norwalk Hospital and medically cleared , and hospital staff notified the Department of Children and Families of the incident .
Through review of surveillance video and based on time-stamped receipts , police determined that the child had actually been alone inside the car from around 3:18 p.m. to around 4:06 p.m. – around 48 minutes . The temperature outside that day was about 85 degrees .
Police obtained an arrest warrant charging Ferguson with risk of injury to a child . She turned herself into police on Friday .
Ferguson was released on a $ 20,000 bond and is due in court on Aug. 22 , 2017 .
Over three years after Mickey Rooney 's death at the age of 93 , the movie icon 's widow today is suing The Hollywood Reporter for elder abuse and intentional infliction of emotional distress in a piquant complaint that alleges some very underhanded journalism on the magazine 's part .
Naming THR itself , Prometheus Global Media and magazine staffers Scott Feinberg , Gary Baum and Features Editor Peter Flax , the October 5 filing by 79-year old and “ frail ” Janice Rooney against the mag ( read it here ) seeks wide-ranging but unspecified damages . The whole action stems from an article posted online by THR on October 21 , 2015 entitled “ Tears and Terror : The Disturbing Final Years of Mickey Rooney . ”
According to Janice Rooney and her lawyers at Woodland Hills ' Buckholtz & Associates , the real disturbing story is the “ deceiving ” THR article , which was published in the print edition of the then Janice Min run mag on October 30 , that she “ felt coerced and pressured ” to participate with . A court document citing article that Rooney says took her words “ out of context and relayed in a manner designed to portray [ her ] in a publicly negative and personally disgraceful light ” after she agreed to talk to THR in late 2015 , over a year after her husband 's death on April 6 , 2015 .
THR Editorial Director Matt Belloni did not respond to a request for comment from Deadline on today 's filing .
Rooney asserts that in agreeing to the October 2015 piece she was promised by Feinberg that “ none of the questions would be published without also publishing her answers thereto in the article. ” The “ Tears and Terror ” piece did fulfill that requirement in a manner of speaking with a link to the full transcript . A link that , as an exhibit to today 's lawsuit reveals , had Rooney responding “ I do n't mean to be rude , but I ca n't believe that 's a serious question ” when asked if she believed around 2010 that “ the government was going to put some Americans into camps and execute the elderly ? ”
“ In the Article , the THR Defendants repeated the essence of the slightly reworded false and humiliating allegations and innuendos brought to them by Charlene against Jan , ” the Thursday filing in LA Superior Court states with reference to Janice Rooney 's daughter-in-law , who is also named as a defendant in the sordid multi-claim and occasionally typo-containing complaint . “ Astonishingly , there were no allegations against Jan of abusing Mickey in either the restraining order filed on February 14 , 2011 , or the September 15 , 2011 lawsuit filed against Chris and Christina Aber and others , ” the eighth Mrs. Rooney goes on to say , mentioning the since settled 2011 action by her husband of almost four decades ' court-appointed conservator Michael Augustine against her eldest son and his spouse in the family civil war suit .
Chris Aber managed the four time Oscar nominee 's business affairs for several years before his younger brother Mark and his wife Charlene took over as Rooney 's caregivers , beginning a new stage in the obviously still ongoing bitter fight over the Babes In Arms actor 's finances , legacy and name . As a part of that fight , Janice Rooney was accused of physically abusing her husband in his latter years , something she says was a misunderstanding .
“ This exemplifies the extent to which Charlene was willing to go to exact her revenge against Jan , knowing how emotionally and mentally damaging and injurious it would be ' for her , ” the extremely dense 28-page complaint adds of the material allegedly provided to the THR journos by Rooney 's daughter-in-law . “ It also exemplifies the lengths to which the THR Defendants would go to write their tabloid Article . ”
“ The conduct on the parts of the THR Defendants alleged herein was done by these defendants with knowledge of Jan 's advance age , and her frail and vulnerable physical and emotional condition , as well as the sensitive nature of the subject matter , all of which they , themselves , acknowledged , “ the suit says of a supposedly months in the making piece that Mrs. Rooney claims went to print mere weeks after she first spoke to THR . “ Despite this knowledge , however , the THR Defendants nonetheless engaged in the conduct alleged herein , whereby they took advantage of Jan 's vulnerability and frail condition , and threatened and coerced her , for their own personal gain . ”
Though he showed up on-screen several times in his final years , the extremely fragile Rooney last prolonged public appearances was in 2011 when he testified before Congress to say he had “ suffered silently ” for years as a victim of elder abuse . A 2013 $ 2.8 million stipulated judgment in the actor 's favor in the case against Chris and Christina Aber remained was never received as Rooney died while insurance companies were locked in a legal battle of their own over who would pay out .
Along with THR , its trio of staffers , and Prometheus , the complaint also lists Mark Aber and Christina Aber as defendents .
In the biggest antitrust court battle in decades , the U.S. government will seek to block the merger of AT & T and Time Warner to prevent the creation of a powerful new television behemoth . With opening arguments set for tomorrow , AT & T will be pointing to the new landscape in which media is increasingly dominated by Big Tech giants like Netflix , Amazon and others . The Justice Department filed suit in November to block the planned $ 85 billion tie-up of AT & T , one of the dominant telecom and Internet firms , with media-entertainment powerhouse Time Warner . The deal had been under review since late 2016 , and the move by the Trump administration represents a test for antitrust enforcers in the digital age .
The case has also been clouded by politics , notably the feud between President Donald Trump and Time Warner unit CNN , which the White House regularly attacks as `` fake news . ''
Unconfirmed reports have suggested the government sought the sale of CNN as a condition for approval of the merger . The Justice Department argues in its trial brief that the tie-up would be bad for competition and raise prices .
If the deal goes through , government lawyers said in the brief , `` American consumers will end up paying hundreds of millions of dollars more than they do now to watch their favorite programs on TV . ''
The brief argues that AT & T could withhold or demand higher prices for prime television content like Time Warner unit HBO 's `` Game of Thrones , '' or sports from Turner Broadcasting . The Justice Department will use a study from Professor Carl Shapiro of the University of California at Berkeley showing consumers could pay $ 436 million more per year if the merger is consummated . AT & T meanwhile argues competition concerns are overblown because the two companies operate in different segments : one is a distributor , the other a creator of content . The deal , according to AT & T , will help competition amid `` a revolutionary transformation that is occurring in the video programming marketplace . ''
The AT & T brief maintains the television landscape is being dramatically changed by `` the spectacular rise of Netflix , Amazon , Google , and other vertically integrated , direct-to-consumer technology companies . ''
It said a combined AT & T and Time Warner would create a stronger competitor for Netflix , Google , Amazon , and Facebook . Time Warner , according to the AT & T argument , can not effectively compete without a digital partner against tech giants , which can gather data for personalized ads and content . Complicating the case is the 2011 approval of a similar tie-up between Comcast and NBCUniversal , with some conditions . AT & T argues the same precedent applies to its `` vertical '' merger and evidence will show the Comcast/NBCU merger `` resulted in no harm to competition whatsoever . ''
Legal experts are divided on the odds of the case , while noting that blocking the deal would go against a decades-long precedent of allowing these kinds of vertical tie-ups .
It will be the highest profile antitrust case to hit the courtroom since the 1990s Microsoft litigation . While some analysts have claimed the case is politically motivated , Judge Richard Leon denied hearing evidence showing AT & T was singled out for prosecution .
When 19 Kids & Counting was still on the air , fans got to see firsthand how Michelle and Jim Bob homeschooled their large brood . Now that the show is no longer featured on TLC , however , viewers are learning about the family 's tradition of homeschooling via Counting On . It 's an interesting shift , to say the least , because it 's possible that the older Duggar kids have different views on homeschooling and education techniques than Jim Bob and Michelle . As for who might deviate from tradition , some people have questions about Jill Duggar , as she leads a life that looks very different from her siblings . Adding fuel to this theory is that Jill is a bit of a rebel by Duggar standards these days ( nose ring , anyone ? ) . So , does Jill Duggar homeschool her kids ? As it turns out , there 's a small chance Jill might choose a different path for her kids .
In case you missed the news , Jill and her husband , Derick Dillard , left for a mission trip to Guadalajara , Mexico on Sunday . Jill and Dillard are traveling with Cross Church College , the school Dillard currently attends in preparation to be minister . `` Pray with us for our group heading to Guadalajara today , '' someone running the college 's Instagram account captioned a snap of Dillard and Jill posing with a large group . And as you can see in the picture below , it looks like the couple 's 8-month-old son , Samuel , will accompany them on their trip .
Although some people might wonder why Jill would bring her young son on an international mission trip , it 's something she has done numerous times before . In fact , Jill 's eldest son , 2-year-old Israel , spent his first years of life living in Central America while Dillard pursued missionary work . Unsurprisingly , Jill decided to homeschool Israel during this time because she did n't want to be separated from him in a new environment . The arrangement turned out to be extremely beneficial for both Jill and Israel , because they were able to learn Spanish together .
`` It 's not easy learning a new language , '' Jill wrote in a July 2015 blog post , according to The Inquisitr . `` But one day soon , I pray I 'll be able to communicated fluently and even dream in Spanish ! I think Israel will pick up on it faster than us though ... he is already becoming a local as he loves to nap anywhere there is a 'hamaca ' ( hammock ) . ''
And Counting On cameras often showed Jill teaching Israel Spanish and encouraging him to engage with local kids his age . Joy-Anna Duggar , who would regularly FaceTime with Israel , said of his development at the time , according to People : “ The culture in Central America is definitely influencing Izzy . It 's so cute just to see him growing up and doing all these different things . ''
TLC on YouTube
But will Jill continue homeschooling her sons while on future mission trips ? What about the boys ' schooling while they 're in Arkansas ?
The answer to these questions is a bit murky thanks to Dillard , who happens to be a bit unpredictable , to put it mildly . Unlike Jill , Dillard attended Arkansas public schools and he graduated from a public university . Making matters even more interesting is that Dillard admitted that he would allow Israel and Samuel to attend college .
The slightly surprising admission surfaced on Jan. 21 after a fan questioned Dillard on Twitter , writing , `` Will your boys ever get the chance to go to college ? Yeah , I did n't think so . '' Dillard replied with a joke about his alma mater 's rival school , saying : `` Absolutely ! As long as the school color is n't red with a wagon mascot lol jk . ''
So , if it 's possible that Dillard would OK college , it 's not too ridiculous to assume that he 'd allow his kids to attend a school outside of his home . In the meantime , however , it looks like Jill and Dillard will stick with homeschooling . Considering the two often travel on mission trips , it might be the best option for their family at this time .

ARLINGTON , Texas ( AP ) — Joey Gallo hit his 33rd home run and the Texas Rangers also played some small ball in a 6-2 victory over the Detroit Tigers on Monday night .
Martin Perez ( 7-10 ) had a second straight solid start for Texas . The lefty made it through six innings without giving up any more runs after trailing 2-0 only three batters into the game .
The Rangers led for good when Delino DeShields had a safety squeeze bunt to make it 3-2 in the second . Rougned Odor scored from third , getting there on a stolen base after catcher James McCann threw behind him trying to pick him off second .
Odor had three hits , including a leadoff double in the fourth , and scored three times . It was Odor 's second consecutive multihit game after going 0 for 17 the previous five games .
Gallo 's eighth homer in August , a shot to center in the third , was estimated by MLB stats at coming off the bat at 112 mph and going 428 feet .
Detroit led 2-0 after Justin Upton 's 23rd homer , a two-run shot to center before a spectacular catch by Drew Robinson ended the top of the first . The center fielder ran a long way before diving , then had his left arm fully extended with his glove only inches off the ground when he caught the ball .
Tigers starter Michael Fulmer ( 10-10 ) walked the first two Texas batters he faced . Nomar Mazara then drove in a run with the first of his three singles , and Adrian Beltre had a game-tying sac fly .
Perez had lost four straight starts before going eight innings at the Mets last Wednesday , limiting New York to one run and three hits . He struck out one and walked two against the Tigers while scattering six hits .
OUTTA HERE
Tigers 2B Ian Kinsler was ejected from the game during the middle of an at-bat in the fifth after having words with home plate umpire Angel Hernandez about balls and strikes . Manager Brad Ausmus also got tossed when he came out to discuss things .
TRAINER 'S ROOM
Tigers : 1B Miguel Cabrera missed his second straight game because of back stiffness .
Rangers : Jake Diekman , who has n't played yet this season after three operations to remove and rebuild his colon , threw 27 pitches during live BP . Manager Jeff Banister said the lefty reliever has been progressing nicely and called it a “ very encouraging day . ”
UP NEXT
Tigers : Justin Verlander ( 8-7 ) will try to win his fourth straight start . The right-hander threw eight scoreless innings last Wednesday against Pittsburgh , and has allowed only two runs over 21 innings his last three starts .
Rangers : A.J . Griffin makes his third start since coming off the DL . He has allowed five earned runs over 11 innings in his last two games .

I reckon investors could look to enjoy delicious winnings by putting their investment cash in gambling giant Playtech ( LSE : PTEC ) .
The company saw revenues soar 12 % last year to €708.6m thanks to a combination of strong organic growth and the positive impact of recent acquisitions .
And the gambling play has plenty of balance sheet strength to keep M & A activity rolling along . The company made four shrewd acquisitions , including BGT and CFH , last year alone at a cost of €240m . It ended 2016 with gross cash of €545m in the hole .
Meanwhile , Playtech can also take great confidence that the revenues should keep streaming higher , as significant contract renewals with industry giants like Paddy Power Betfair and William Hill in 2016 locked nine of the company 's 10 major clients into long-term deals .
An ace investment
Now although investors have piled back into Playtech with gusto in recent weeks , I believe the online betting star still offers splendid value for money .
For 2017 it is anticipated to report a 28 % earnings rise , resulting in a P/E ratio of 13.1 times , far below the benchmark of 15 times broadly considered great value . As well , a sub-1 PEG reading of 0.5 underlines its bargain status .
Furthermore , the extra 9 % bottom-line rise forecast for 2018 creates a P/E multiple of just 12 times .
Dividend chasers have plenty to cheer about too , Playtech 's progressive dividend policy chucking out payout yields of 3.5 % and 3.7 % for this year and next . The firm lifted the payout 15 % last year and I believe dividends should keep detonating as cash levels head through the roof .
Safe as houses
I believe retirement property builder McCarthy & Stone ( LSE : MCS ) is another hot FTSE 250 stock currently dealing at irresistible prices .
City brokers expect earnings at the construction colossus to leap 11 % in the year to August 2017 , leaving McCarthy & Stone dealing on a P/E ratio of 12.6 times and a PEG reading bang on the value watermark of one .
And expectations that earnings growth will rev to 28 % in fiscal 2018 pushes McCarthy & Stone 's P/E ratio to 9.8 times , and PEG multiple to 0.3 .
Dividend yields for 2017 and 2018 may be less impressive , at 2.7 % and 3.2 % , but to my mind they do not undermine the builder 's position as a stunningly-priced stock star .
Uncertainty following the EU referendum in June saw McCarthy & Stone 's order book cool down during the dying embers of last year . But the company has seen customer activity steadily picking up again more recently , the constructor noting this month that “ lead sales indicators ( enquirers , sales leads and visitors ) [ were ] well ahead of the previous year ” during September-March .
So with last year 's sales moderation appearing to be nothing more than a blip , and McCarthy & Stone pulling hard to meet its completions target of 3,000 units by 2019 ( up 30 % from current levels ) , I reckon the builder remains a compelling pick for stunning long-term earnings expansion .
Talk about trading up : Castle-bound Meghan Markle , who used to live part-time in Toronto while she filmed her former role on TV series Suits , recently moved out of her two-story Toronto bachelorette pad , which is now up for sale .
Being sold by Freeman Real Estate for owners fashion and style editor Elizabeth Cabral and husband Kevin O'Neill , the redecorated coveted love den – which includes three bedrooms , 2 bathrooms , landscaped back garden and a two-car garage – is located at 10 Yarmouth Road in downtown Seaton Village and is listed for just under $ 1.4 million . ( Cabral and O'Neill reportedly purchased the rental property in 2007 for just over half a million dollars . )
But it could fetch more given the walls bared witness to the fledgling love story of Markle and her fiancé Prince Harry during his not-too secret romantic jaunts across the pond .
But celebrity watcher Shinan Govani is n't convinced the Harkle factor will spark a bidding war .
Govani laughs , asking Postmedia Network rhetorically , “ Does the Toronto real estate market really need any extra help ? Putting the royal love pad on the market – complete with dubious-looking fence – is more of a boon for royal reporters than anything else , I suspect . I see , by the way , that many are pulling out the evergreen real estate euphemism , ‘ quaint ' , for the house . ”
Unless another boldface name moves in , neighbours will be thrilled to have their formerly quiet street back : During Markle 's residency , an almost-daily invasion of security and media made navigating through the area an arduous affair .
Regardless , here 's a look into the home the played the not-so-secret backdrop for the royal super couple :
Influenza activity has begun to surge across the country and Saskatchewan is no exception .
According to surveillance data conducted by the province on influenza rates , confirmed cases this flu season are up 60 per cent compared to this same time last year .
There have been two ICU admissions since September 1st , two outbreaks in long-term care homes and experts predict things are about to get even worse .
“ The flu is picking up now in the middle of December and we think it 's going to peak towards the end of the year or early in the new year , ” said Dr. Saqib Shahab , Saskatchewan 's Medical Health Officer .
There has been a concentration of 47 cases in Saskatoon and surrounding area , also formerly known as the Saskatoon Health Region . Regina and surrounding area has had 17 confirmed cases so far this flu season .
Statistics also gathered by the provincial government show that recorded flu rates are the highest among the working population , aged 20-64 years old .
“ People cough and it 's very easy for the virus to transmit from one person to another , ” said Dr. Simon Kapaj , Saskatchewan Health Authority , Deputy Medical Health Officer in Saskatoon .
“ Always our message is if you 're working in hospitals or long-term care centres , people that are sick need to avoid these areas . ”
This influenza season has been especially bad because it started early say experts and because of the strains in circulation .
“ The concern with the H3N2 strain is it leads to serious complications and this is especially for seniors and individuals with chronic illness such as diabetes , lung disease , heart disease and so on , ” Dr. Kapaj added .
All more the reason health officials say , to get the flu shot ahead of the holiday season to protect you and the ones you love .
Although the vaccine 's effectiveness can vary based on what virus strains are in circulation both doctors admitted , but say it 's still better than nothing .
“ It 's always a good idea to get the flu shot especially if you have a high risk condition and if it 's a good match the protection is higher , ” Dr. Saqib Shahab said .
“ If it 's not such a good match – you 're still protected to some extent . ”
Approximately 340,000 doses of vaccine were ordered by the province for this flu season , of that 250,000 doses have been administered
“ Which is 11 per cent higher than the similar period last year or the year before that when 225,000 had been given , ” Dr. Shahab said .
The vaccine also takes about two weeks to provide full protection against the flu so it 's advised you get a shot sooner rather than later .

GM 9-speed automatic transmission Enlarge Photo
After General Motors and Ford committed to co-developing new 9- and 10-speed automatic transmissions , Ford has passed on the former .
Per the agreement , Ford took on work for the 10-speed automatic , used for rear-wheel-drive vehicles , and GM undertook the 9-speed automatic for front-wheel-drive applications . Ford 's reason for rejecting GM 's transmission ? The efficiency gains did n't outweigh the extra weight and cost , Ford spokesman Mike Levine said in a statement to Automotive News on Monday . Strangely enough , Ford apparently decided against using the 9-speed transmission before GM introduced the unit .
Instead , Ford plans to adopt GM 's 9-speed automatic for an 8-speed automatic transmission . The 8-speed auto will find its way to a handful of Fords and Lincolns to start such as the 2019 Edge and 2019 Nautilus . Ford plans to rework one of its 6-speed automatics to create an 8-speed automatic for performance-oriented vehicles . Ironically , the 6-speed automatic comes from a previous GM tie-up in 2002 .
To Ford 's point , the GM vehicles equipped with the 9-speed automatic feature minimal fuel economy gains . In fact , the 2019 Buick Envision , which switched from a 6-speed to the 9-speed , achieves one mile per gallon fewer than before on the highway at 25 mpg versus 26 mpg .
GM believes the 9-speed automatic provides a more seamless shifting experience and more premium feel .
`` Smaller steps between gears in a nine- versus an eight-speed enable smoother shifts for customers , '' GM spokesman Tom Read said .
Although Ford has said `` no thanks '' to the 9-speed , GM has happily utilized the 10-speed automatic . The transmission is found in the Camaro ZL1 and GM 's trucks and SUVs .

Schools across the Western Cape will remain open tomorrow despite the planned strike action by the South African Federation of Trade Unions ( Saftu ) . The trade union has promised a complete shutdown around the country , as it protests against the national minimum wage and other labour issues .
There are a number of rumours and fake news posts doing the rounds on social media claiming that schools will shut until Wednesday 2nd May 2018 . The Western Cape Education Department says this is not true and has urged parents , learners and members of the public to not share this fake news .
“ The planned strike action is not a legitimate reason to close schools . I understand that the distribution of this fake news has been cause for alarm amongst our teachers , learners and parents , but I wish to assure you that schools will be open tomorrow , Wednesday 25th April 2018 , ” says MEC Debbie Shafer .
“ There is no doubt that some schools , especially our commuter schools , will experience late coming or absenteeism due to the strike action . Our schools will however accommodate learners as far as possible and arrange catch up sessions for those learners who missed a significant part the day 's lessons . ”
South Africa 's biggest teacher and education workers ' union SADTU , an affiliate of COSATU , confirmed that teachers will not take part in the nationwide strike planned by SAFTU .
“ We want to categorically refute the lies peddled by some SAFTU leaders claiming that COSATU will join their strike on Wednesday . This is done deliberately in order to cause confusion among our members , ” said SADTU in a statement .
“ We urge SADTU members not to be misled to heed SAFTU 's mischievous call to embark on an unprotescted strike that will result in no work , no pay . ”
SADTU said members who are going to take to the streets on Wednesday need to know that their strike is not protected because SADTU has not called for the strike .
“ SADTU will never support the strike because as an affiliate of COSATU . We support the National Minimum Wage that will see an increase in salaries of more than 6 million workers who are currently earning less than R3500 a month , which is much higher than the R1800 which business and employers were insisting on . ”
“ SADTU and COSATU members should know the difference between a living wage and Minimum Wage . Our demand for a Living Wage remains and we see the National Minimum Wage as one step towards realizing our living wage demand .
SADTU members will attend Cosatu rallies and marches all over the country on Tuesday 1 May . VOC

BEIJING ( China ) , Feb 15 ( APP ) : China 's second aircraft carrier is scheduled to be launched later this year and is expected to enter the service by 2020 .
This was stated by Xu Guangyu , a retired Chinese military officer and consultant to the China Arms Control and Disarmament Assn in an interview with Beijing Media Network here on Wednesday .
China 's first home-made aircraft carrier , designed to be a base for fighter jets and helicopters , is now near completion . The aircraft carrier is the first of the Type 001A class , and represents an important step in advancing China 's naval power .
“ The aircraft carrier is being built as planned . Most of its major construction and design work has been completed . Its hull has already been assembled in a shipyard . The ship will soon be equipped with aviation , radar and other facilities , ” said Chinese Defense Ministry Spokesperson Wu Qian .
Yin Zhuo , a Chinese naval expert , also confirmed in a CCTV interview that China 's first home-made aircraft carrier is expected to be launched in water in early 2017 .

The new aircraft carrier could begin its sea trial by early 2019 , Xu said .
Xu also mentioned in the interview that Chinese carrier pilots are also under training , with an expectation of forming two aviation units .

A mother daughter duo from Chorley are lacing up their trainers to take on the London Marathon in memory of a relative who died of epilepsy .
Cathy Karn , and her daughter Millie , will take on the challenging 26.2-mile run on Sunday , April 23 to raise funds for Epilepsy Action .
They want to help raise £1m for the charity after their niece and cousin Carla Rankin died three years ago , aged 27 .
Millie , 24 , said : “ We 're running the London Marathon fuelled by the memories and love of our truly wonderful niece and cousin , Carla . She is worth every breath , blister and more . ”
Since Carla 's death in 2014 , her family have spearheaded ‘ Team Carla ' . It includes her friends from all over the country , who have taken on a range of fundraising challenges . These have included the Manchester 10k , Tough Mudder , the London Marathon and the Royal Parks Foundation Half Marathon . In 2016 , they organised a ‘ One in a Million ' charity ball and raised over £22,800 in just one night . Their second ball in 2017 raised over £57,000 . So far , Team Carla has raised over £120,000 in Carla 's memory and their fundraising mission shows no sign of stopping .

South Korean taekwondo athletes have performed for Pope Francis , after a planned show of Korean unity at the Vatican fell apart when the North pulled out at the last minute .
Pope Francis did n't seem to notice or mind , thanking the athletes Wednesday for their exhibition “ which was a show of the will for peace , the two Koreas together . ”
South Korea 's World Taekwondo organization , the Seoul-led international body , said last week that a demonstration team from the North withdrew from the performance over the U.S.-South Korean military drills .
The performance had been planned to ceremonially open the World Taekwondo 's Grand Prix competition this week in Rome .
The South 's team performed for thousands of people in St. Peter 's Square and featured a young girl releasing a dove in a sign of peace .

Oscar-winning actress Emma Stone has landed a deal worth up to $ 10 million to become the face of LVMH brand Louis Vuitton .
Page Six TV exclusively reveals that the “ La La Land ” star has been in talks with the luxury brand for nearly a year , and has just agreed to sign on for two years .
The deal will include glossy TV and print ads worldwide , and the star will wear their high-end gowns on the red carpet .
A source told us , “ LVMH has been pursuing Emma for nearly a year , she was initially reluctant , but now she has agreed to be the face of the brand for two years for a figure between $ 6 and $ 10 million. ” An announcement is expected soon .
Interestingly , the French fashion house had previously been chasing Stone 's “ La La Land ” co-star Ryan Gosling for three years , but , “ Ryan repeatedly turned Louis Vuitton down because he does n't do endorsement deals . ”
“ The Danish Girl ” star Alicia Vikander was previously signed as the face of Louis Vuitton in 2015 . Other stars who have appeared in campaigns for the fashion house include Diane Kruger , Uma Thurman , Gisele Bündchen , Pharrell Williams , Scarlett Johansson , Kanye West , Angelina Jolie , Muhammad Ali and Michelle Williams .
Stone , 28 , won an Academy Award earlier this year for her performance in “ La La Land. ” She is currently starring as Billie Jean King in the the movie “ Battle of The Sexes ” and her upcoming movies include “ The Favourite , ” set in the court of Queen Anne in early 18th Century England .
Reps for Stone and Louis Vuitton did n't immediately get back to us .
Defence Secretary Sir Michael Fallon is to step up calls to Nato allies to boost their military spending to counter the growing threats of terrorism and cyber warfare .
Attending a meeting of alliance defence ministers , Sir Michael will echo demands by US President Donald Trump for all member states to meet the Nato target of spending 2 % of GDP on defence .
The two-day gathering in Brussels will mark the first visit to Nato headquarters of new US Defence Secretary General James Mattis since taking office last month .
During the election campaign , Mr Trump rattled some members by describing the alliance as `` obsolete '' and questioning US commitment to the defence of Europe .
Since becoming President , however , he declared his support for Nato while insisting other member states must bear more of the burden of the collective defence .
Ahead of the talks , Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg was keen to highlight figures showing the European members and Canada had raised their defence spending by 3.8 % in real terms last year .
However , Nato officials confirmed that the UK - along with the US - remained one of just five member states to meet the 2 % target .
On Tuesday , the Ministry of Defence flatly rejected a claim by the International Institute for Strategic Studies think tank that the UK spend had actually dipped below 2 % .
Sir Michael - who will have a one-to-one session with General Mattis - will re-iterate Britain 's support for demands for the other member states to do more .
`` Nato has been a guarantee of mutual security for more than half a century , '' he is expected to say .
`` Britain is now calling for our partners to step up and share burdens on spending and help it become more agile in dealing with new threats including cyber and terrorism .
`` As leading player in the alliance we recognise the importance of backing up our operational and exercise commitments with investment in new equipment to deal with threats to our security . ''
WASHINGTON ( AP )  The Trump administration came into office looking to dismantle Barack Obamas health care law , but the Affordable Care Act survived . Now the administration is on the hook to deliver a smooth ending to sign-up season , with a crush of customers expected this week .
For millions of eligible consumers time runs out on Friday . ( Continued below )

Dec. 15 is the last day for procrastinators to enroll in subsidized private coverage in 39 states served by the federal HealthCare.gov website . Consumer interest has remained brisk , even as the Trump administration cut the sign-up season in half , reducing it from roughly from 90 days to 45 days .
Its more likely than ever that theyre going to run into real volume problems in the last week because thats when everybody is going to show up ,  said Tim Jost , a legal analyst who closely follows the workings of the ACA .
Heavy traffic could slow the website , and lead to long hold times at the federal call center . For the vast majority , this is the last opportunity to secure coverage for 2018 , or switch from an existing plan . One exception : People living in hurricane-affected areas can get an extension to sign up by Dec. 31 by contacting the HealthCare.gov call center . That could make a difference in states such as Texas and Florida .
Enrollment fluctuates in the course of the year , but its estimated that 9 million to 10 million people currently have coverage through the ACAs marketplaces . The markets cater to people who dont have access to a job-based plan , and participation is expected to dip somewhat next year .
In a twist , many people eligible for financial help may actually be able to pay lower premiums in 2018 . Although list price premiums for the most popular plans went up sharply , so did taxpayer-provided subsidies that limit how much individuals actually have to pay . In many communities , bare-bones bronze plans are available for no monthly premium to those eligible for subsidies .
Sign-up season has been free of problems up to now , insurers say . Scheduled early Sunday maintenance shutdowns have not been a disruption .
Nonetheless , administration officials at the Health and Human Services department are saying little about their contingency plans for the final week . Thats a contrast from the Obama years .
The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services , which also administers the ACA , did say that the deadline hour will remain the same this year  midnight Pacific time . That means consumers on the East Coast will have until 3 a.m. on Saturday morning to enroll .
Although the Trump administration slashed the advertising budget , HealthCare.gov has been sending out targeted emails to people potentially eligible . Examples :
 Dont forget : Friday , December 15 is the last day to pick a 2018 Marketplace plan.
 FINAL DEADLINE : Enroll in a 2018 health plan before December 15 or risk going without Marketplace coverage.
 Come back to HealthCare.gov to select a plan before the final deadline or risk missing out on 2018 Marketplace coverage.
During the Obama years , officials allowed a grace period for consumers who started an application before the final deadline , but were unable to finish . Its unclear if the Trump administration will allow such extensions , or whether it will strictly enforce the deadline hour . Previous extensions allowed hundreds of thousands of consumers to enroll .
Failure to provide extensions this year would be a mistake , said Andy Slavitt , who oversaw HealthCare.gov under Obama .
It really would not be fair to people , particularly if there are technology challenges with the last minute surge as there have been every year ,  Slavitt said .
While Dec. 15 is the deadline for states served by HealthCare.gov , thats not the case in all parts of the country . Most states that run their own health insurance websites are providing an extended period for consumers to enroll . In California and New York , for instance , the deadline remains the same as last year  Jan. 31 . Other states have deadlines spanning from late December to mid-January .
Economist Joe Antos of the business-oriented American Enterprise Institute said the Trump administration has to get it right . Otherwise , it reinforces the Democrats charge that Trump is bent on sabotaging the health law .
Everything that goes wrong will be attributed to White House malevolence ,  said Antos . Donald Trump should not be tweeting negative statements this week . If he were to tweet at all , I would suggest : Be sure to check your plan.
Credit cards are both awesome and terrible at the same time . They can be crazy helpful for big purchases that you need to make , but between hidden fees , outdated mobile apps , and plenty more , credit cards can often be a pain to use . If you 're looking for a reliable alternative to traditional credit cards , the Affirm app could be just the thing you need .
What 's new with Affirm ?
March 19 , 2018 - Affirm now allows you to secure credit in-store and then use it during checkout

Now , when you 're in a participating store about to make a large purchase , you can apply for financing right there by filling out a easy five-field application within your Affirm app . In seconds , you 'll receive a real-time credit decision .

Rob Pfeifer , Chief Retail Officer at Affirm , cited consumers ' medley of shopping preferences as basis for the new features in a statement :
The US Federal Communications Commission plans to turn over oversight of internet service providers to another federal agency as it plans to vote on Thursday to revoke the landmark 2015 “ net neutrality ” rules .
FCC Chairman Ajit Pai last month unveiled plans to repeal the rules that prohibit internet service providers from impeding consumer access to web content . The 2015 rules bar broadband providers from blocking or slowing access to web content .
On Monday , the FCC and Federal Trade Commission said they plan to enter into a Memorandum of Understanding coordinating efforts under the new rules . The agencies said the proposal will “ return jurisdiction to the FTC to police the conduct of ISPs . ”
Pai said Monday in a statement the agencies “ will work together to take targeted action against bad actors . ”
Under Pai 's proposal , the FCC would no longer bar any specific internet provider practice but require companies to disclose if they block , throttle or offer paid prioritization of internet traffic .
FCC Commissioner Mignon Clyburn , a Democrat , said the agreement “ is a confusing , lackluster , reactionary afterthought : an attempt to paper over weaknesses in the chairman 's draft proposal repealing the FCC 's 2015 net neutrality rules . ”
The FTC will investigate if internet providers fail to make accurate disclosures or if they engage in deceptive or unfair acts or practices . ” The FTC is committed to ensuring that Internet service providers live up to the promises they make to consumers , ” said Acting FTC Chairman Maureen Ohlhausen .
FCC Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel , a Democrat , said “ FTC enforcement would happen long after the fact -- many months , if not years , after consumers and businesses have been harmed . ”
Chris Lewis , vice president of advocacy group Public Knowledge , said the FCC is “ joining forces with the FTC to say it will only act when a broadband provider is deceiving the public . This gives free reign to broadband providers to block or throttle your broadband service as long as they inform you . ”
Democrats and net neutrality advocates plan a series of protests ahead of Thursday 's vote . Pai 's proposal has already won the backing of the three Republicans on the five-member commission . The reversal represents a victory for big internet providers such as AT & T Inc , Comcast Corp and Verizon Communications Inc that opposed the 2015 rules .
Pai 's proposal is opposed by large internet companies including Alphabet Inc and Facebook Inc .
The new rules are expected to take effect in January and draw court challenges .
Occasionally in years past , the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival brought in legends of the classic rock era and stature to supplement the indie/youth orientation of the bill , including Paul McCartney , Roger Waters , Leonard Cohen , and Steely Dan . Promoter Goldenvoice has lately seemed less interested in that cross-generational crossover — leaving it up to the younger artists themselves to make it happen , by offering cameos from their biggest influences .
Friday , it was the teen brothers Lemon Twigs bringing on Todd Rundgren for a climactic collaboration on his 1972 “ Could n't I Just Tell You , ” a song on anyone 's list of the half-dozen quintessential power pop singles . “ It was such a dream come true for us , ” says Brian D'Addario of getting the wizard/true star to step in on the “ Something/Anything ? ” classic .
Sunday , Thundercat brought the 1970s lightning with a three-song appearance by Michael McDonald , a drop-in that 's somewhat less surprising , since the Doobie Brother appeared on Thundercat 's “ Show You the Way , ” though probably no one at Coachella was expecting a bonus performance of “ What a Fool Believes ” in anyone 's set .
“ Todd said he 'd never been ” to Coachella , D'Addario recounts . “ He said , ‘ I hear that 's the one that people die at . ' ” D'Addario is reluctant to give away any secrets about how the Twigs got Rundgren to join them in the desert . “ I do n't want other people stealing our idea , ” he jokes . But the brothers met him after Rundgren 's New York City Winery show in March , and their managers subsequently reached out to each other about making a joint appearance happen .
Rundgren was impressed by what he saw before he got on stage — especially compared to other acts he caught before leaving the festival . “ After watching the Twigs and seeing what they do , a lot of the other bands seemed kind of like shucking , ” Rundgren says . “ Like , the Twigs should have been on the big stage , and put one of these shucking bands on the smaller stage . ”
In at least one sense , Rundgren was more impressed by Coachella than he expected to be . “ I expected it to be funkier than it was . It 's actually a fairly well organized — one might even say anally organized — event , ” he says . “ I was interested to see what people wanted to listen to , and some of it seemed obvious to me , like the big crowd for Radiohead , while there were some bands that I had never heard of that were drawing fairly substantial audiences , if only out of curiosity . But overall , the event impressed me as something like a hookup … less about the music and more about girls being as scantily clad as they possibly can , and men getting really drunk and hitting on them . Music seemed an aspect of it , but it did n't seem to be the principle reason why people were there . ”
But he has nothing but laudatory words for his hosts , saying the Twigs “ have a natural performance sense , [ as opposed to ] what tends to happen nowadays , where bands go to extremes in terms of either mopey-ness or artifice on stage . But both these guys have been performers for a considerable portion of their lives , and when they get to the stage , it just seems really natural what they do , as if they 've been doing it for 10 years — and I know that is n't quite possible , because the youngest of them is only 18 years old . Listening to them on record is one thing , but when you see them live and how effective they are and how musical they are , it 's another experience , and I was really impressed . There 's a variety of influences that a lot of contemporary artists have I more or less ignored . It seems like they 're willing to put in the effort to come up with very elaborate arrangements that have lots of tempo and time-signature changes and interesting sort of suspended chords — stuff that you do n't hear from a lot of other artists anymore . The symphonic approach that you might attribute to a band like Queen , that 's too much work for a band nowadays , ” he says , chuckling .
For the Lemon Twigs , Rundgren is dad-rock , which in their case is a very commendable thing , remembering that their father “ always told us about his Utopia [ album , “ Deface the Music ” ] where they dressed up as the Beatles , because my dad really liked that , ” says the eldest of the teen D'Arrios . We were generally aware of him , and then we got really into him when we made the record , because our producer , Jonathan Rado , is really , really into Todd. ” What they came to love is his “ coupling that love of songs with experimentation — he just has the ability to do both — and then the way he 's continued to do his own thing . I think that 's something we also want to continue to do , and not feel like we have to appeal to what other people 's expectations of us are . He obviously wants to fully explore every facet of everything that he can do in music . Even a lot of our other favorites do n't do that . ”
McDonald believes that musical appreciation tends to skip a generation , which is why he can go over so well with a Coachella audience while a star closer to the median between his age — 65 — and the average fest-goer might not .
“ Each generation tries to disassociate itself with the last generation , ” McDonald says . “ And then about three decades later , people kind of start to maybe appreciate what you might have done a while back that you do n't even realize you did . So it 's been fun to get out and play with bands like this , ” says the singer , who 's also performed at other recent festivals with Solange and members of Vulfpeck and Skinny Puppy . “ We were around long enough ago that we are n't from just 10 years ago , so , you know , people are n't holding up crosses at us , ” he laughs .
McDonald was on stage with Thundercat in the Mojave tent for three numbers — their collaboration “ Show You the Way , ” plus the former 's “ What a Fool Believes ” and the latter 's “ Them Changes. ” “ Watching Steve [ Bruner ] play bass , he 's almost like a culmination of Stanley Clarke and Marcus Miller , in putting something together that is influenced by so many of the people that came before him , ” McDonald says . “ I always kind of think of stuntmen . Back in the old days the big trick was falling off your horse , and now these guys are falling off 15-story buildings . It 's amazing what some of these young musicians accomplish , to me , Steve is one of those . ”
McDonald drove down from Santa Barbara with his daughter , who provided tips on who to see , like Sampha . “ The whole weekend for me was a lot of going to school on what I was seeing and hearing , and I 'm really impressed by the artistry of people we saw like Father John Misty . There 's a whole other thing in that they 're fearless in the fact that they 'll get into their niche and develop this thing that they do without any regard for what 's commercial or what is n't commercial or what record companies or managers would or would n't tell them to do . It 's impressive to me that these guys do what they do best with no fear and develop it to a fine art . ”
McDonald was left with some questions , though . “ Father John Misty 's band was great , and it was a large orchestra , so of course I 'm thinking from the standpoint , too , of a practical touring musician , like : How does he afford all those people ? ”

Mumbai : Sub-urban train commuters at the Elphinstone Road-Parel stations in Mumbai got a big relief as the Western Railway on Wednesday threw open a 73-metre-long foot-over bridge ( FOB ) .
Work on the 6-metre-wide FOB was initiated on 29 September last year , the day on which a stampede at Elphinstone Road foot-over bridge staircase killed 23 people .
The FOB connects Parel station and new platforms of Parel Terminus . It 's opening comes a day after a part of the pedestrian pathway of Gokhale Bridge , a road over bridge in Andheri ( East ) , collapsed amid rains , bringing train services of the Western Railway to a halt for several hours .
The FOB construction work got over on Tuesday and it was opened for passengers on Wednesday without any `` ceremony '' , Western Railway Chief PRO Ravinder Bhakar told PTI .
`` The FOB has been built at a cost of Rs 9.85 crore and is in addition to the one constructed by the army recently at the northern end , '' Bhakar said . It will enable commuters to travel between Elphinstone Road and Parel stations from both ends , he added .
`` Western Railway floated the work tender on 6 November , 2017 and the Letter of Acceptance was issued the next day . The construction work commenced on 8 November , '' he said .
Two girders on the Western Railway portion of the bridge were launched in March and April 2018 , he said . The FOB work was completed in record time despite constraints like removal of encroachments , shifting of utilities , cutting and trimming trees and rains obstructing the work , he said .
The FOB is `` passenger-friendly '' and less prone to corrosion , Bhakar said . The FOB material is a single skin elf-supported aluminium standing seam roofing system . It is made up of 0.9 milimetres thickness of aluminium alloy with Polyvinylidene Fluoride ( PVDF ) coating on exposed surface . This material has been imported from Dubai and has been given curvature in India depending on shape of roof .
`` These sheets will have a better durability and will be free from leakages , '' Bhakar said . `` The sheeting surface has been designed in such a manner that solar panels can also be fitted on them , '' he added .
Encouraged rather than discouraged .
That 's the optimistic outlook of Vancouver Canucks general manager Jim Benning following a meeting earlier this week with Henrik and Daniel Sedin , in which the pending unrestricted free agents confirmed they will wait until the end of this National Hockey League season to decide their playing futures .
“ That was a mutual thing between us , ” Benning said Friday . “ I did n't want the whole thing to be where I was forcing them into making a decision now . I just wanted to know if they had a particular idea of what they wanted to do .
“ We talked about it the other day ( Wednesday ) and it was a mutual agreement that they would just play out the year and see how these last games go and then we 'll sit down and talk . ”
The decision was n't surprising . In fact , it was expected .
The Sedins stated in September that their physical and mental health , family considerations and a willingness to be meaningful 38-year-old support players next October on a transitioning team would factor into their decisions .
And even though Benning was hoping for an indication of which way the future Hall of Famers were leaning to better prepare for the Feb. 26 trade deadline and the off-season , that was never going to happen .
The Sedins have earned the right to make sure everything is right in their world . They played less than 12 minutes Thursday . They have played as many as 19 and are averaging 15 .
The Sedins were sold on playing less this season in an uptempo system . They were sold on meaning more to the team in the room and in advantageous situations on the ice — especially on what has become the league 's sixth-ranked power play — and that 's part of the equation that may work in Benning 's favour . Especially with Henrik third in team scoring with 34 points ( 2-32 ) and Daniel fourth with 32 ( 13-19 ) .
Benning wants the Sedins to return for another season after their four-year , US $ 28 million contract extensions expire . He wants them to continue to work in concert with future captain Bo Horvat and Calder Trophy contender Brock Boeser .
“ They like the direction of the team , ” added Benning . “ They 've played with Bo Horvat ( power play ) and seeing his growth and seeing Brock 's game this year , they feel that takes some pressure off them in having to score every night .
“ And to see the way Brock has scored helps . Just the development of our young players is encouraging to them . We 're going in the right direction and they seemed happy with it . ”
However , would the Sedins be happy with a big reduction in their expiring $ 7 million salaries ? Are they going to take less money than Brandon Sutter ( $ 4.3 million ) or how much more should they get than Sam Gagner ( $ 3.1 million ) ?
Free-agency comparables would ensure the Sedins are properly compensated . But if they slide , is that going to be a problem ?
“ No , ” Henrik said recently . “ I 'm not going to pay to play , but if it comes to that and they offer us something , that is not going to be part of it . It 's just the way it is with negotiations . It 's going to be a fair deal either way .
“ You might say he signed for a little bit too less , but it 's never been a major thing with money — it has never been for us . ”
What has always weighed on the Sedins — especially with a club that will miss the playoffs for the fourth time in the last five seasons — is to what degree young players will do everything possible to make themselves better every day .
A lack of commitment drove the Sedins to some stark criticism down the stretch two years ago , but now younger players seem more committed and are showing more drive . That has n't gone unnoticed .
Another key component is how this team will change in the off-season .
A youthful infusion is of paramount importance to the future , but it 's unfair to expect Adam Gaudette , Elias Pettersson and Jonathan Dahlen to leap right into NHL play without some AHL seasoning . The Sedins want to see a competitive step and environment , but only if prime prospects are ready for prime time .
In the interim , do the Canucks commit to all of their restricted free agents , most notably Markus Granlund , Sven Baertschi , Jake Virtanen , Troy Stecher , Derrick Pouliot , Reid Boucher , Philip Holm , Michael Chaput and Joe LaBate ? Or is that too much of organizational status quo ?
And do they deal pending unrestricted free agents Erik Gudbranson and Thomas Vanek at the deadline to maximize return ?
“ That stuff will take care of itself , ” said Benning . “ We have to decide if we 're going to re-sign Gudbranson and what that looks like and if it 's reasonable , we 're going to try and do it . And if not , we need to get some assets back for him . ”
As for Vanek , the notion that he would re-sign here if the Sedins retired to fill a production and leadership void is tempered by concern of giving up term and money to play in a less-competitive environment .
“ Teams will reach out to me if they have interest and think he 's a missing part of their puzzle , ” said Benning . “ But we 've also talked about re-signing him . Our pro-scouting meetings are coming up next week and we 'll have a better idea of what we 're going to do . ”
OVERTIME — The Canucks held college free-agent meetings Friday and will target defencemen and forwards who are ready to sign or will leave school early and NHL ready . Sam Gagner suffered concussion-like symptoms Thursday after a heavy check on Tomas Jurco . He was re-evaluated Friday and his prognosis for recovery was expected to be revealed Saturday . Nic Dowd was expected to replace Gagner on Saturday against the Tampa Bay Lightning .

Shura Hamdard has emphasized that It is the need of the hour that Pakistani media should perform as society 's reformer and not only as an informer , which is being done by it at present .
Rating is the only purpose of electronic media now and the sense of power has made it self-proclaimed .
It seems that T.V . Anchors became the extension of political parties and no research has been done before starting a take show with no result in the end in which substandard language is used .
While conclusion note by the anchor at the end of a talk show is given on channels of BBC and CNN .
This was stated by the renowned journalist , writer and poet , Mehmood Sham while he was addressing the meeting of Shura Hamdard Karachi chapter , presided over by Justice ( Rtd ) Haziqul Khairi on August 10 , 2017 on the theme : “ Basic national problems and priorities of media ” at a local hall . Mrs Sadia Rashid , President , Hamdard Foundation Pakistan was also present at the meeting . Mehmood Sham further said that the services of Madam Ruth Pfau to Pakistan were most valuable and extraordinary .
Nostalgic shoppers everywhere felt a pang this month at the news that beloved store Toys `` R '' Us would be closing its stores in the United States , and that the company 's chain for younger tots would be included in the shut-down . Now , many customers want to know : What is the Babies `` R '' Us closing date ? The company has yet to announce an official day that the doors will shut for good , but the clock is ticking , so you 'd better stock up on all those baby essentials ASAP .
Romper has reached out to Toys `` R '' Us for comment on an expected closure date and did not immediately hear back . But in its bankruptcy filing earlier in March , the chain said , according to USA Today , `` The stark reality is that the ( chain is ) projected to run out of cash in the U.S. in May . '' The filing said that going-out-of-business sales would start immediately , while employees would be paid for `` no fewer than 60 days , '' and gift cards would be accepted for 30 days . CNN Money reported that the company will be holding a bankruptcy hearing on Tuesday , after which consumers might learn more specifics .
Meanwhile , Business Insider reported that the company plans to shut down stores and warehouses in certain states by May 14 , while Toys `` R '' Us liquidation sales could start as soon as Thursday .
All in all , it may be hard to find the exact date that your local store will close , but it seems likely that it will be within the next couple of months . But there 's one reason that many Babies `` R '' Us fans are particularly worried , and eager to learn details about official closing dates — baby registries .
People who went through all the hassle of making a baby registry at Babies `` R '' Us want to know if they did it all for nothing . And the answer is ... maybe ? It depends on how long you need your registry to stay up . According to Toys `` R '' Us CEO Dave Brandon , as CNN Money reported , the company will maintain its Babies `` R '' Us registries and online store for `` the next few weeks . '' Part of the reason for that is that the company is still looking for a buyer who wants to take on about 200 of the chain 's best-performing stores . And if that buyer `` wants to keep a foothold in the US they will likely do that in such a way that they can retain customers , [ such as ] people involved in our baby registry programs , '' Brandon reportedly told employees , according to CNN Money .
Still , finding a buyer is far from guaranteed , so if you 'd been relying on a Babies `` R '' Us registry , it might be wise to start making some contingency plans now . Lots of people are feeling bummed about the upcoming closures . Toys `` R '' Us ( and Babies `` R '' Us ) has been around for decades , and many parents who love taking their children there now loved going there themselves when they were kids . Those earworm-y Toys `` R '' Us commercial jingles were stuck in the heads of '80s and '90s children for years . Many of those Toys `` R '' Us kids still do n't totally want to grow up and face the fact that their childhood paradise will soon be no more .
But , of course , the company had trouble competing with online retailers like Amazon , and with big box stores like Target and Walmart , which could sell the same toys for lower prices , and in a convenient location where parents could also fulfill their own purchasing needs . As USA Today reported :
Babies R Us has about 5 % of market share for online baby product sales , trailing Amazon.com 's almost 20 % , according to market researcher IBISWorld .
While it 's not a total surprise that Babies `` R '' Us is closing , it 's still a bummer . ( In addition to the nostalgic twinge , the store shut-down also means that some 31,000 workers will reportedly lose their jobs , according to CNN . ) Although the closing date may not yet be totally clear , one thing is certain : if you love shopping at Babies `` R '' Us , time is running out .

Growing up , Marcello Pinnero and Matthew Sapienza knew each other from attending the same schools in Holmdel .
But it was n't until they joined the Holmdel High School boys track and field team that they became friends . And good friends at that .
Along with their friendship and being teammates , the duo just became the two best hurdlers in Monmouth County .
Pinnero ran a personal best and school record 7.88 in capturing the 55-meter hurdles at the Monmouth County Indoor Championships held Jan. 12 at the Bennett Indoor Athletic Center in Toms River .
Finishing right behind Pinnero in second place was his teammate Sapienza , who stopped the clock in 8.06 .
“ This ( a one-two finish at the county championships ) was something we talked about last spring after we went one-two at the Lion Invitational , ” said Pinnero . “ We race well when we run together . ”
The teammates had every reason to believe the one-two was possible because five days earlier , they sparked the Hornets ' 55-meter shuttle hurdles relay team , which included Anthony Prestigiacomo and Derek Vander Woude , to victory at the Monmouth County Indoor Relays .
“ It boosted our confidence a lot , ” Pinnero remarked . “ We knew we had a big chance to get it . ”
The two Hornets were lined-up side-by-side for the final after running the two fastest times in the preliminaries – Sapienza even ran a personal best 8.04 . It was a great situation for two best friends who race their best when they 're together .
“ It was a pretty close race , very intense , ” recalled Pinnero . “ At the end when I knew I had done it I realize it was very sweet . ”
It became sweeter when Sapienza closed in fast to take second .
“ I had a good start , ” Sapienza remarked . “ In the middle I slowed down . Towards the end I slid into second place by running through to the finish line . ”
Sapienza said the Hornet teammates “ kind of earned ” that one-two finish .
Pinnero and Sapienza have a unique relationship for teammates competing on the same high level . For one , it 's not destructive and they appreciate having a competitor there to push them through workouts and bring out their best . There is no damaging rivalry .
Not only do they race well together , Sapienza noted , but they also work out together well . Whether its sprinting , practicing their hurdle form , working on their starts out of the blocks or hitting the weight room , they push each other to new heights .
Holmdel head coach Jonathan Cole said the seniors are a model their teammates should emulate .
“ They are the perfect example of teammates who work hard for themselves and for each other but , also because of each other , ” said Cole . “ They work hard every day not just to be better than the other guys , but also because they know the rest of their team depends on them and they do n't want to let the other guys down . ”
Neither Pinnero nor Sapienza looked at themselves as hurdlers when they went out for the track team . They were sprinters first . Cole puts an emphasis on hurdling and looks at every sprinter to see who could be excelled at it . It 's how Pinnero and Sapienza started , and also how they have flourished .
“ I decided to give it a try the winter of my freshman year , ” said Pinnero . “ By my sophomore year I was beginning to get my form down and racing better . ”
Sapienza said he took his first try at the event as a sophomore and by the indoor season of his junior year , he too had become a top-notch hurdler . He credited it to “ improved form . ”
The two Hornets pay a great deal of attention to form and technique as It 's paramount to winning races . That 's why plenty of practice time is spent on it . The key is to hold your form through to the finish line you , allowing hurdlers to fly past those losing form and slowing down as a result . That exact scenario enabled Sapienza to slide into second place at the county championships .
Both Pinnero and Sapienza showed significant improvement hurdling last spring , getting second and fourth at county championships , which set them up for big things their senior years . So far , it has been just that .
Together , they both would like to make it individually to the Meet of Champions in the hurdles and they will run any relays that will help the team .
Cole has turned Holmdel track and field into a hurdling power with plenty of depth behind his two stars . The shuttle hurdles relay team has already qualified for the New Balance Indoor Nationals on March 9 to 11 at the Armory 's New Balance Track and Field Center in New York City . At the Jan. 19 NJSIAA State Group 2 Relays , Pinnero , Sapienza , Prestigiacomo and Vander Woude lowered the shuttle hurdles relay school record to 30.72 in finishing second behind Rahway at the Bennett Center .
It 's been that kind of record-setting season for the friends and teammates , and there is no sign of it slowing down .

London : England limited-overs captain Eoin Morgan expects a `` young and hungry '' Australia will be `` galvanised '' by the ball-tampering scandal that rocked world cricket when the old rivals meet in a one-day international series next month .
England , currently involved in a Test campaign with Pakistan , resume their involvement in 50-over cricket with a one-off match against Scotland in Edinburgh on 10 June before returning home for a five-match ODI series with Australia .
The England fixtures will be Australia 's first international matches since a ball-tampering scandal during a Test match against South Africa in Cape Town in March led to the ongoing suspensions of then captain Steve Smith , his deputy David Warner and batsman Cameron Bancroft .
Australia will also be without all three members of their Ashes-winning fast-bowling attack — Mitchell Starc , Pat Cummins and Josh Hazlewood .
'One eye on the World Cup '
But Morgan , who led an England team currently number one in the ODI world rankings to a 4-1 win over Australia in a five-match series held 'Down Under ' in January , remained wary of the threat posed by the World Cup-holders .
`` I think they will , with one eye on the World Cup , they will come with a strong performance , '' Morgan told reporters at an event in London on Wednesday to mark a year until the start of the 2019 World Cup in England and Wales .
`` What 's happened to them in the last six months has the potential to galvanise a young , hungry side . ''
Morgan added : `` So we 're going to have brought our ' A game ' to this series . It 's going to be a good challenge for us moving forward . ''
Injury 'not the worst news '
The former Ireland batsman was included in England squads for both the Scotland match and the Australia series announced Wednesday despite suffering a finger injury fielding for county side Middlesex during a One-Day Cup match against Somerset on Sunday .
Morgan was set to captain the World XI in a charity match against the West Indies at Lord 's on Thursday , which is being held to raise funds for stadiums in Dominica and Anguilla damaged by hurricanes that swept through the Caribbean last year .
But while he wo n't be able to play in that match , Morgan will take charge in Scotland and then in five matches against Australia starting at The Oval on 13 June .
`` I have a small fracture in the ring finger of my right hand , '' Morgan explained . `` I got hit in a game on Sunday at Somerset . It 's disappointing , but it 's not the worst news that could have come through .
`` It 's a week-to-10 days to get the swelling down in the finger and then protect it as we go on . ''
Morgan was disappointed , however , to be sidelined from Thursday 's match at Lord 's .
`` It was my first time being selected in a charitable but also World XI game , it 's very special to be selected , '' he said . `` It 's at my ( Middlesex ) home ground , I 'll definitely be there to watch and support , but it 's a shame to miss out . ''
England 's 13-man squad for the ODI against Scotland in Edinburgh on 10 June :
Eoin Morgan ( Middlesex , capt ) , Moeen Ali ( Worcestershire ) , Jonathan Bairstow ( Yorkshire ) , Sam Billings ( Kent ) , Alex Hales ( Nottinghamshire ) , Liam Plunkett ( Yorkshire ) , Adil Rashid ( Yorkshire ) , Joe Root ( Yorkshire ) , Jason Roy ( Surrey ) , Ben Stokes ( Durham ) , David Willey ( Yorkshire ) , Chris Woakes ( Warwickshire ) , Mark Wood ( Durham )

Germany must eventually follow other European countries in banning new diesel vehicles from roads , German Chancellor Angela Merkel said in a magazine interview published on Monday , although she declined to commit to a specific date .
BERLIN : Germany must eventually follow other European countries in banning new diesel vehicles from roads , German Chancellor Angela Merkel said in a magazine interview published on Monday , although she declined to commit to a specific date .
Merkel said it was up to automakers to restore consumers ' confidence in them after the emissions scandal , including through trade-in bonuses and software updates . Consumers , who had been `` deceived '' , must get the environmental emissions performance they had been promised , she added .
The priority for coming years should be to expand the charging infrastructure needed for deploying more electric vehicles , she said .
Until then , driving bans for dirtier cars already on the road should be avoided , she said because that would `` punish the people who bought cars in good faith . ''

The suspect who authorities say fired on Republican lawmakers as they played baseball on Wednesday raged against Republican U.S. President Donald Trump on social media and idolized Bernie Sanders , who he viewed as the only politician who understood the working class.A senior U.S. official named the gunman as James T. Hodgkinson from the St. Louis suburb of Belleville , Illinois . Media reports said he was a 66-year-old home inspector . He died from injuries sustained in a shoot-out with Capitol Hill police who were at the scene in Alexandria , Virginia . He is believed by investigators to have been a person `` of strong views , '' the U.S. official said , without elaborating.The Belleville News-Democrat , the local newspaper , posted a photo of Hodgkinson protesting outside a post office there in 2012 , wearing sunglasses and a goatee and holding a homemade placard that read `` TAX the Rich . `` Hodgkinson was a member of many anti-Republican groups on Facebook including `` The Road to Hell Is Paved With Republicans , '' `` Terminate The Republican Party , '' and `` Donald Trump is not my President , '' a search of what appeared to be his profile showed.Trump won the U.S. presidential election in November and took office in January . Republicans also control both chambers of Congress .
`` Trump is a Traitor . Trump Has Destroyed Our Democracy . It 's Time to Destroy Trump & Co. '' Hodgkinson wrote in a March 22 post that linked to a Change.org petition calling for the removal of Trump from office.His timeline was headed by a cover photograph of Sanders , a U.S. senator from Vermont who campaigned unsuccessfully to be the Democratic Party 's presidential candidate last year . Hodgkinson 's profile picture was a U.S. flag overlaid with the slogan , `` Democratic Socialism explained in 3 words : 'We the People . ' Since 1776 . `` According to media reports , Hodgkinson owned a home inspection business called JTH Inspections . Its license expired in November last year and was not renewed , the reports said .
Hodgkinson was charged in April 2006 with battery and aiding damage to a motor vehicle , according to state records . The charges were dismissed , the records show . He pleaded guilty to a 2007 speeding offense , driving 15 to 20 miles per hour over the limit , according to court records in Jefferson County , Illinois . The records identified him as a five-foot , six-inch ( 1.67-meter ) man weighing 190 pounds ( 86 kg ) , with brown eyes.According to his Facebook profile , Hodgkinson went to Belleville Township High School West and studied flight training at Southwestern Illinois College .
A review of his online posts stretching back several years found that his public posts were almost exclusively about politics , and that they often sharply criticized Republican politicians and policies.Among the most frequent topics Hodgkinson wrote about were income inequality and money in politics . He referred to Citizens United v. FEC , the landmark 2010 U.S. Supreme Court ruling that eased regulation of campaign spending , as `` Citizens Divided . `` Sanders said in a statement on Wednesday that the suspected gunman was somebody who had `` apparently volunteered '' on his presidential campaign . He condemned the shooting , saying he was `` sickened by this despicable act . `` Beginning around the summer of 2015 , Hodgkinson began often expressing enthusiastic support for Sanders ' 2016 campaign.Sanders , an independent , ran an insurgent campaign during the Democratic primary as a progressive populist on a platform that promised to increase taxes on the wealthy and broaden the social safety net in the United States . He was defeated in the nominating contests by Hillary Clinton . `` Bernie is the Only Candidate in Decades that Really Cares about the Working Class , '' Hodgkinson posted on June 13 , 2016 .

Coordinators of AMPLIFY Christian Music Festival held an appreciation luncheon for area supporters of the event on Thursday at The Enclave Gallery in Benton . The August AMPLIFY event was deemed a success by those who coordinate the annual festival .
Josh Turner , co-director of AMPLIFY , said that there may have been 2,500 attendees at the first AMPLIFY event . “ Every year we learn and every year we grow , but it is the support from the community , ” Turner said , ” that has helped this become the event that it has . ”
Jeremy Josephson , co-owner of Rock City Staging , gave testimony to the fact that AMPLIFY is a unique festival . “ I travel across the country and work with some of the biggest names and biggest bands , “ Josephson said , “ But what is happening in Benton and Central Arkansas with AMPLIFY is unprecedented . ”
He compared the festival to Jesus feeding the 5,000 , the miracle of the five loaves and two fish . “ We are the bread and the fish , ” Josephson said , “ but we are now feeding more than 60,000 . ”
Matt Brumley , co-director of AMPLIFY told supporters that during a festival training session in Nashville earlier this year he learned that this festival has become the largest Christian Music Festival in the country . “ The guy who told me so , a man who puts on massive concerts and festivals across the country , also told me that he never thought we would make it three years , ” Brumley added .
Brumley listed a few statistics from the 2017 event which included 450 volunteers , 62,508 attendees from 18 states plus Canada and more than 400 decisions for Christ . “ This is why we do what we do , ” Brumley stated .
Brumley also talked about two of the local partners of AMPLIFY : The Call and the support for PANS / PANDAS Treatment . The Call , with an office located at 2010 Military Road in Benton , is a nonprofit organization whose mission is to educate , equip and encourage the Christian community to provide a future and a hope for children in foster care . PANS /PANDAS are autoimmune disorders that are affecting children locally and across the state .

U.S. President Donald Trump , in a traditional presidential statement issued every April 24 , used the term `` Meds Yeghern , '' an Armenian term meaning `` great calamity , '' and once again avoided labeling the events as `` genocide , '' just like his predecessor Barack Obama .
In a statement to mark Armenian Remembrance Day , Trump said the U.S. recalled `` the horrific events of 1915 and grieve for the lives lost and the many who suffered . ''
`` As we honor the memory of those who suffered , we also reflect on our commitment to ensure that such atrocities are not repeated , '' he added .
While president , Obama had also used the term `` Meds Yeghern '' to describe the 1915 events that took place in the height of World War I .
Trump also said he stood `` with the Armenian people throughout the world in honoring the memory of those lost , '' reiterating his commitment to working with the community to build a better and more tolerant future .
The deaths of Armenians in eastern Anatolia in 1915 occurred after some Armenian nationalists sided with invading Russians and revolted against Ottoman forces . A subsequent relocation of Armenians resulted in numerous casualties .
Turkey describes the events of 1915 as a tragedy for both sides . Ankara has repeatedly proposed the creation of a joint commission of historians from Turkey and Armenia , along with international experts , to tackle the issue .
Whereas Armenia , joined by its powerful diaspora institutions around the world , describe the killings as `` genocide '' with a highly inflated estimate of up to 1.5 million deaths .
Trump used the same estimation in his statement and said that the deaths resulted from deportation , massacres and death marches .
Armed with rocks and concrete , officials have been battling to fortify an earthen hillside next to Lake Oroville that has eroded — a critical task in case the reservoir overflows again .
A quarry is being worked around the clock to produce boulders that are being used in a desperate attempt to plug unexpected holes caused by erosion from water overflowing from the lake .
Raoul Ranoa/Los Angeles Times ( Raoul Ranoa/Los Angeles Times )
The fear is that if Lake Oroville , California 's second largest reservoir , starts spilling over in the coming days , weeks or months , water again will pour down this hillside and create further erosion , carving fissures into the slope and removing chunks of earth .
That could again chew away land that leads to the base of the concrete barrier along the edge of the lake , and a catastrophic failure could send a 30-foot wall of water down the Feather River , the largest tributary to California 's longest river , the Sacramento .
The crisis this week caused authorities to order evacuations of more than 100,000 people in three California counties : Butte , Yuba and Sutter .
Trucks have been dumping boulders — some as big as 4 to 6 tons — to patch some areas of the hillside , while helicopters have been dropping sacks of rocks in another place . Workers are mixing in a concrete slurry to help seal and solidify the placed rocks .

“ You 're putting rocks in a hole . Then you 're putting slurry in to solidify it , ” said Chris Orrock , spokesman for the California Department of Water Resources . “ When water comes down , it will hit that patch and roll off . ”
And that 's important — keeping water away from vulnerable spots that eroded when overflowing reservoir waters rushed down this hillside .
A convoy operation of sorts was kicking into gear Tuesday . Quarries were being called into action , with one , Bangor Quarry , operating 24 hours a day to produce boulders as heavy as 6 tons , with trucks in the morning coming in every few minutes to load up .
From there , rocks arrived at a lot just south of Oroville Dam . Rocks then were available for two operations . Yellow dump trucks hauled boulders over the dam and dumped them into eroded pockets of the hillside . Helicopters plucked sacks of rocks and deposited them on the far edge of the hill .

Workers transported a green pumper truck to inject concrete inside eroded hillside crevices . They also were building a gravel roadway in the bed of the eroded hill to reach other danger spots .
Some of the most visible efforts to shore up the hillside were just below a low concrete retaining wall , or weir , designed to be the last , the best defense for an overflowing Lake Oroville . It 's designed to hold Lake Oroville to its maximum height . If the lake flows over the brim , water would travel over this concrete wall , known as the emergency spillway , onto the hillside .
This past weekend was the first time the emergency spillway had been used since Oroville Dam , the nation 's tallest , was completed in 1968 .

( Brian van der Brug / Los Angeles Times )
By late Sunday , the immediate crisis was averted when officials decided they had no other choice than to lean harder on the crippled main spillway , a concrete chute that had been operating at reduced capacity because of its own partial disintegration . Luckily , the damaged main spillway was able to withstand the increased flows of water , and lake levels have been lowering since Sunday night .
On Tuesday afternoon , officials downgraded the evacuation order to a warning .
The game plan is to keep water behind the Oroville Dam below what its engineering designs call “ flood control storage. ” At that depth , the dam would have a buffer capacity of half a million acre-feet of water .
At the current release rate , a pounding 100,000 cubic feet per second , the dam will reach that point by late Saturday , early Sunday , even with another rain system arriving Wednesday , said Bill Croyle , acting director of the state Department of Water Resources .
Croyle said he is certain of the integrity of the main spillway and the steep hillside used for emergency overflow . Even so , he said , “ Our goal is to remove as much water from the reservoir [ as needed ] so we do n't have to use it . ”
Currently , crews are dropping 40 truckloads of rock an hour on the eroded slope , a process Croyle said would continue despite his belief that the slope is now safe enough to use if needed .
Falling temperatures associated with this week 's approaching weather system will help , by lowering the elevation at which some of that precipitation falls as snow and is locked up until spring . But Croyle said that merely delays when the dam will be required to handle the melt from what has been a spectacular snow year .
He said state engineers are using cameras to monitor the damaged section of the spillway and also are watching it from above and by overhead flights . The current release of water creates a curtain that obscures most of the gaping hole that appeared earlier , but what is visible from the side suggests there has been no increase in the damaged area .
“ It 's performing very well , ” Croyle said .
Butte Sheriff Kory Honea said he would leave it to residents to decide for themselves whether to leave if rising water levels again force the use of the emergency spillway . He said he would order another evacuation only if something were to suggest the repaired slope was again deteriorating .
Croyle said the amount of water released from the dam during the crisis is a state record . Archived data from the state agency show water releases exceeding 150,000 cubic feet per second in 1997 , leading to the failure of a levee on the Feather River downstream and the evacuation of communities for 22 days .

5 questions the new NHL bench boss is already dealing with before the first puck drops in the regular season .
People do n't even know the opening night lineup and the second guessing has already begun .
Welcome to Vancouver , Travis Green .
In this NHL city everyone knows more than the coach . And , to be fair , Green is the fourth head coach in six seasons so maybe some do .
Green turned heads late this week when he had Markus Granlund , one of his most efficient goal scorers , on a checking line . Meanwhile the pre-season 's cover boy Jake Virtanen , one of the Canucks the best skaters , seemed like the odd man out .
Will Green change things up before the Canucks ' regular season opens Saturday night against Edmonton ?
He just may .
While we wait to find out , here are the five biggest questions the coaching staff faces this season :
1 . How will this coach staff develop kids ?
It felt like there was an audible gasp echoing throughout the Fraser Valley the moment Virtanen was practising as the 13th forward .
Wait , what ?
The player who just reclaimed the hearts and minds of Vancouver 's hockey fans , the guy who made us collectively believe again — as much as you can believe after a really good pre-season — could now sit out the opener ?
What kind of fresh hell is this ?
And if that did n't launch people into a heart-screaming panic , Brock Boeser excluded from the Canucks ' power play sure did .
The Chicago Blackhawks just wiped the Pittsburgh Penguins 10-1 with two rookies in prominent roles , and yes both were on the power play . Just last season those same Hawks had six rookies get substantial ice time .
So what gives in Van City ?
Virtanen crushed it all pre-season and now he 's going to sit for Alex Burmistrov who made one good play ?
Well , as coach Green pointed out , not everyone develops in the same way or at the same speed .
Boeser and Virtanen made the team , sure . But , turns out , it does n't mean they 're playing 82 games . Or even half that .
Green even suggested Friday 60 could be a lot .
“ Some ( young ) guys can probably play — I do n't know a number — say 50 games or 60 games , ” Green said . “ It depends on how smart a player is ; where he 's at ; what he has to work on ; and if that can be attained at the NHL level without hurting his development .
“ There 's no magic formula for developing players .
“ ( And ) this is not just about developing players , this is making sure we develop players while we want to put a competitive team on the ice . ”
The Canucks spent a lot of money this summer buying free agents , in part to ensure prospects did n't have to , well , play NHL games .
But many have assumed if players such as Virtanen and Boeser are in Vancouver instead of Utica , they 'd need to play at least 10 minutes a game and even more to make it worthwhile .
Not so , Green said .
“ Some players can play 10 minutes a night and get better , and some need to play more , ” Green said . “ I saw the other night the young player for Edmonton ( Kailer Yamamoto ) , I think he had 6½ minutes . I thought he had a good game .
“ Some guys ca n't skate as well if they 're playing seven or eight minutes . Sometimes , young players need to learn that . They 're used to playing a lot of minutes and it 's hard for them .
“ We have to find that magic number for guys to see if they 're productive playing 10 , 12 or eight minutes . ”
2 . Will the special teams improve ?
Watching the Canucks power play last year was much like seeing a toddler attempt to crack a safe . The dial just kept turning and turning but no one ever got any closer to the loot .
How bad was it ? Just about as bad as it gets . Only one team had a lower success rate and only two generated fewer shots .
The Canucks averaged 43.77 shots per 60 minutes on the power play . For comparison , the 2013-14 Canucks hit 58.31 shots per hour . It 's been a steady , and massive , decline since .
Much has been done to try to flip the trend . Newell Brown , known for his love of movement and the drop pass , was hired to coach the power play . Both Thomas Vanek and Sam Gagner were signed to score on the power play .
Thing is , there 's still no obvious trigger man on the Sedins ' group , which is expected to include Vanek , Gagner and either Alex Edler or Michael Del Zotto on the point .
Can movement help that group generates enough shots ? That right there will be Brown 's biggest challenge .
“ Some units look for the perfect plays out there , ” Sven Baertschi said . “ But as long as you have pressure , as long as you have shots , you can build off it .
“ The hardest thing to defend is if shots are coming on net . Everything gets messed up on rebounds . As long as you get shots , you 'll be good . ”
The power play gets all the headlines , but the Canucks ' penalty kill last year was just as bad and it does n't have any incoming free agents expected to save the day .
“ We need to be better , for starters , ” Green said . “ We 've changed a few things with our kill . And it 's going to be up to our players . They 're going to have to kill penalties stronger than they did in the past .
“ Maybe it 's little details they have n't done in the past . I 'm not going to get into how the team killed in the past . ”
Hmmm .
3 . How will Green 's systems work with this team ?
It 's great the Canucks are vowing to play an uptempo , aggressive style , but are we all going to pretend a year ago the team was n't saying the only way they could succeed was to play tight , buttoned up and defence-first ?
Consistently in the pre-season , the Canucks have said they want to play fast . It 's still a little unclear how that can happen when Thomas Vanek is playing with the Sedins on a top line .
Vancouver will definitely be relying on Green 's systems to generate improved speed in its games and the players think that system is going to lead to more scoring .
“ We 're not the biggest or strongest , but we are going to play hard and fast and those are the two biggest things , ” Baertschi said .
“ There will be a faster pace . I do think we 'll be a competitive team . What we 're trying to do is play at a quicker pace and not wait for teams to skate into traps .
“ I love it . I think anybody who wants to play in the offensive zone would . It 's hard to defend when guys come at you quick . ”
Most assume the lack of talent means the Canucks ca n't play this way and win .
But the good news is Green 's systems proved to be really effective for his Utica teams which almost always had inferior talent . Will it translate ?
We 're about to find out .
4 . How impatient will Green be with his lines ?
There were pros and cons to Willie Desjardins ' lineup patience . There were times it paid off in a huge way . He kept Baertschi and Bo Horvat together through some bleak times , and they both came out of it better for it .
Other times , it did n't work out so well , like when Desjardins continued to station Brandon Sutter on his team 's first power-play unit months after it became obvious he was ill-suited for the role .
Green is expected to have an itchy trigger finger with his lines , and is expected to be had more of Alain Vigneault 's blender in him than Desjardins ' loyalty .
“ I 've played two games for him and the lines did change over the course of the game , ” Horvat said . “ I think he likes trying different things .
“ He likes seeing which guys are going and I think he likes to mix and match with what 's working . I do think he 's going to mix it up more than Willie . ”
Is that a good idea ?
“ I think it is , ” Horvat said . “ You have to go with guys who are finding chemistry . It 's good to be always looking for ways to generate offensive production . ”
5. Who is the starting goalie ?
In short , there is n't one .
If the Canucks were being honest , they 'd tell you the hope is Jacob Markstrom can establish himself as a No . 1 goalie .
They 're paying him nearly $ 3.7 million for the next three seasons .
It 'd be an upset if the guy they brought in on a two-year deal with an average cap hit of $ 2.5 million wins the job over time , but it 's entirely possible .
Really , there is not a lot to choose from with him and Anders Nilsson . For the first time in a while , the position is up for grabs .
Green said he has n't even mapped out the first 10 games , promising to make his calls by who is playing well .
That 's a massive difference from a year ago when the Canucks were adamant Ryan Miller was the starter .
Will Green stick to his word or will Markstrom 's salary dictate he gets a much longer leash than has been suggested ?
This week will be a good test of that , especially if the Edmonton Oilers light up the Canucks in the opener , something more than a few people are predicting .

When Mercedes-Benz debuted the 2019 CLS450 at the L.A. Auto Show last month , it made no mention of an AMG version . A new report from Automotive News says there will be no top-shelf CLS63 variant , but there will be a new CLS53 .
Speaking to Mercedes-AMG head honcho Tobia Moers , Automotive News learned that the Mercedes-AMG CLS53 will launch in the U.S. by the end of 2018 . The model will be powered by a more potent version of the new turbocharged 3.0-liter inline-six , and will also get Mercedes ' fancy 48-volt electrical system and EQ Boost electric motor . Exact power output was not disclosed , but Moers said horsepower will “ for sure be in the 400s. ” AN predicts around 430 hp , which is more than the current twin-turbo V-6-powered AMG 43 models put out . Moers says to watch out for AMG 53 variants of the E-Class coupe and convertible and GLE as well .
The reason Mercedes is n't doing another CLS63 is because it wants to give its similar four-door Mercedes-AMG GT ( rumored to be called GT4 ) some breathing room . Both will be coupe-styled sedans based on the E-Class ' platform , but the GT4 will be positioned as the sportier option packing AMG 's twin-turbo 4.0-liter V-8 . In addition , a hybrid variant is rumored to be in the works .
More details on the CLS53 will be announced at the Detroit auto show next month . The AMG GT4 is expected to go on sale in 2019 .

Vice-chancellors and other highly paid university staff should halve their salaries to help efforts to lower tuition fees , according to a former education minister .
Lord Adonis said no vice-chancellor has produced figures to show their university 's arts and social studies courses , among others , c ost £9,250 to deliver or that they are worth such a sum .
In an interview alongside Southbank University vice-chancellor David Phoenix , the Labour peer told BBC Radio 4 's Today programme : `` M y own view is that Southbank University , and I say this in the presence of the vice-chancellor , could offer many of these courses for about half that level .
`` And one of the places they could start saving money soonest , and I say this again with Dave here as I think it 's as well we have these issues out in the open , is his own salary and that of his senior management team .
`` Dave is paid a salary of £295,000 for leading a public service institution . He has 10 staff at his university who are paid over £100,000 .
`` All of those salaries , in my view , should be halved . That would save £1 million alone and that would be a big first step towards reducing fees . ''
Mr Phoenix replied : `` I wish I was paid that , I 'd like to see ... ''
Lord Adonis , a vocal critic of the salaries of vice-chancellors , intervened : `` You are , it 's in your accounts for last year . ''
Asked about his salary , Mr Phoenix said : `` My base salary is £227,000 . ''
Lord Adonis added : `` You then have additional allowances on top and you have a big pension contribution . ''
Mr Phoenix later said he believes staff salaries receive media coverage as it `` deflects from actually the true question '' , which is how much students need to pay at source .
He added : `` The fees system when it came in , I think , was incredibly beneficial both to universities and individuals because it did help make sure people could access funds to access education .
`` But I would support the view the balance of fees has gone too far .
`` But universities have to make sure they have a sustainable organisation - that they have the money to invest in the future . ''

The 37-year-old Terry joined Villa from Chelsea in July 2017 on a one-year deal . He made 36 appearances for Villa in all competitions last season , scoring one goal .
`` We would like to place on record our most sincere thanks for the effort and professionalism he showed with us last season , '' Villa said in a statement on their website https : //www.avfc.co.uk/News/2018/05/30/club-statement-john-terry-leaves-aston-villa .
`` John is a true leader and was everything and more that we hoped . Hugely popular and influential in the dressing room , he played a real captain 's role in creating the incredible bond the players shared with our supporters , and vice-versa . ''

SINGAPORE : The wow factor at this year 's Singapore Airshow is ratcheting up with the arrival of two F-35B fighter jets on Saturday afternoon ( Feb 3 ) at Changi Airport .
This is the first time the jets are being seen in Southeast Asia .
The F-35B fighter jets are here courtesy of the United States Marine Corps , and it is believed that there is interest in them by several military and defence forces in the region .
Produced by Lockheed Martin , the jet is able to take off from a short runway and land vertically without a runway .
Currently , no Asian countries have the jet , though its smaller and more conventional cousin , the F-35A , is used by the Japanese and Koreans .

New Delhi : Business schools are struggling hard for placements with only 20 percent students landing job offers , making this placement year the most challenging in recent times , according to Assocham .
The chamber observed that job opportunities for business school ( b-school ) students are drying on account of factors like demonetisation , lacklustre business sentiment and stalling of new projects .
`` Grim placement scenario is reflected in b-school campus hiring this year which has gone down severely than last year which was 30 percent .
`` The salary packages which are offered at b-schools and engineering colleges are also being curtailed by 40-45 percent as compared to last year , '' Assocham said .
The Assocham Education Council ( AEC ) said many parents and students are re-thinking on investing three-four years and several lakhs in a course .
More than 400 institutions have become defunct as they are not getting enough students to be viable , said the chamber .
As per its findings , a large number of b-schools and engineering colleges are not able to attract students . More than 250 b-schools have already closed down since 2015 in major cities including Delhi-NCR , Mumbai , Bangalore , Ahmedabad , Kolkata , Lucknow , Dehradun etc . Another 99 are struggling for their survival , reveals the report .
The biggest reason for the gap is the rapid mushrooming of tier-2 and tier-3 management educational institutes that have unfortunately not been matched by the uplift in the quality of management education , said the chamber .
The root cause of the problem is that institutes only focus on filling up seats and do not consider the quality of students at the time of intake , it said .
Assocham has suggested improving the infrastructure , train their faculty , work on industry linkages , and spend money on research and knowledge creation and making students employable rather than employed .

Telecoms giant BT Group ( LSE : BT.A ) made a number of bad calls lately and today trades at a lowly valuation of just 10.19 times earnings . Many investors are seeing this as a buying opportunity , which it may well be , but I reckon I have seen a better one .
Gim me a G…
Engineering company GKN ( LSE : GKN ) is also trading at just 10.19 times earnings , after being punished by falling margins in the aerospace industry . Today 's share price of 316p is almost 17 % down from its 52-week high of 379p . That valuation looks tempting , but what are its prospects ?
Last month , GKN reported a positive set of first-half results yet still disappointed the market . Sales rose 15 % ( 5 % organic ) , while reported profit before tax soared from £182m to £559m , and free cash flow from £40m to £116m . Given those numbers , you might have expected its share price to rocket , but investors kept their feet firmly on the ground on warnings that growth rates may struggle to keep up with last year 's tough comparisons .
Margin call
Investors are troubled by GKN 's trading margins , which narrowed from 8.6 % to 8.4 % . Its aerospace division is a particular concern , with margins down from 9.9 % to 9.3 % , due to higher UK pension costs , asset writedowns and operational challenges in North America . Organic sales growth in its aerospace division also failed to fly with reported growth of just 1 % . Margins in its Driveline business slipped from 7.9 % to 7.8 % , and from 12.6 % to to 11.3 % in Powder Metallurgy .
However , these disappointments seem to be reflected in the share price . GKN 's outlook still looks promising , with an 8 % rise in military aerospace sales offsetting a 1 % drop in commercial deliveries . Rising automotive sales in China will further boost GKN Driveline and GKN Powder Metallurgy .
Our friend electric
GKN has positioned itself for accelerated electric car sales , which looks a prescient move , and has already delivered 400,000 systems to its global customer base . Its 2015 purchase of Fokker also appears to be paying off . The yield is only 2.8 % but nicely covered 3.5 times and management policy is progressive , with a recent 5 % hike in the interim dividend to 3.1p per share .
BT Group is yet to recover from the far greater shock of its Italian banking scandal . At today 's 294p it remains more than 25 % off its 52-week high of 400p . Last month 's Q1 results did little to repair sentiment , with adjusted EBITDA earnings down 2 % to £1.79bn , and reported revenue climbing just 1 % to £5.84bn .
Sky fallout
BT has other concerns aside from Italy , such as increased pension costs and business rates , the costly battle for sports programme rights amid signs of declining viewer interest , and the cost of investing in the business . Chief executive Gavin Patterson has a lot more on his plate , as sales slow , Ofcom intensifies its regulatory assault on BT 's Openreach network , and the excitement generated during the glory years of its Premier League challenge to Sky fades .

The Al-Qaida linked al-Shabab has banned single use plastic bags in territories it controls , according to an announcement made on the terror organization 's Radio Andalus .
Deeming plastic bags a `` serious threat to the well-being of humans and animals alike , '' with the terrorists declared the new measure on July 3 , International Plastic Bag Free Day .
Jubaland regional leader Mohammed Abu Abdullah , who announced the ban on the radio , said that the use of plastic bags was wasteful , and therefore was bad for the environment . The terrorist leader also banned the logging of several rare tree species in the same broadcast .
How the militant group will enforce the bans is still unclear but civilians are expected to obey the rules out of fear due to the group 's violent nature .
The group 's efforts to go `` green '' have been deemed hypocritical and ironic by many as its members have slaughtered thousands of innocent people , abducted hundreds of children and women and sexually assaulted them .
Similarly , the Taliban militant group in Afghanistan had called on Afghans to plant more trees for 'worldly and other-worldly good ' in 2017 .
Al-Shabab militants have been fighting Somalia 's internationally recognized government for control of the country since the group was ousted from Mogadishu in 2011 by African Union-led forces .
Despite being forced out of Mogadishu and many other cities and towns across Somalia , the group still holds sway in large parts of the countryside and launch regular gun and bomb attacks on government , military and civilian targets in Mogadishu and ambushes on military convoys and outposts . Al-Shabab has also attacked neighboring countries that have sent troops to support the Mogadishu government .
On Jan. 15 , 2016 , the militants killed over 100 Kenyan soldiers during the El-Adde military base attack . In April 2015 , the militants carried out their bloodiest attack on Kenya 's Garrisa University where they killed at least 148 students .
NFL Nation reporters predict the outcomes and scores for Sunday 's and Monday 's Week 5 games .

The Bills might be 3-1 and playing the 1-3 Bengals , but Vegas seems to like Cincinnati in this game . Buffalo is at least a three-point underdog on the road , suggesting this could be a trap game for the Bills after big wins over Denver and Atlanta . The Bills ' offense -- which has gone three-and-out on 48 percent of drives this season , second-most in the NFL -- will be playing shorthanded at wide receiver because of a thumb injury to No . 1 wideout Jordan Matthews . Tyrod Taylor has excelled in passing to Charles Clay and LeSean McCoy this season , but the Bengals boast the NFL 's lowest yards per catch ( 6.49 ) by opposing tight ends and running backs . Bengals 13 , Bills 9 -- Mike Rodak
The Bengals have a tough matchup against one of the league 's best defenses ( Buffalo is 10th overall ) , but it looks like their offense finally has begun to click in the past two weeks . The Bengals can build on their momentum here , and a win would make them 2-3 prior to their bye . Bengals 14 , Bills 10 -- Katherine Terrell

Coach Todd Bowles says `` 2-2 is nothing to brag about . '' In most cases , he 'd be right , but there has been a sense of satisfaction this week in the Jets ' locker room -- a possible red flag . It would n't be a shock if they underestimate the Browns , but they have too many matchups in their favor to lose the game . Josh McCown has completed 75 percent of his passes against the blitz , which bodes well against the blitz-heavy Browns , who have allowed a 127 passer rating when blitzing . It sounds crazy , but the Jets will win their third straight game . Jets 20 , Browns 17 -- Rich Cimini
Old friend Josh McCown is healthy and completing 70 percent of his passes , and the Jets have won two in a row with the kind of run-pass balance that the Browns should study . At 0-4 , the Browns talked a good game all week , but there was a feeling that folks were looking over their shoulder . That 's not the attitude a winless team needs . Jets 24 , Browns 10 -- Pat McManamon

The Lions are strong against the run , which makes the timing of Panthers quarterback Cam Newton finding his timing against New England most important . But the key in this one will be the ability of the Carolina defense to make the Lions one dimensional and force Matt Stafford to beat them . Stafford already has been sacked 12 times , and the Panthers , with future Hall of Famer Julius Peppers playing at a high level ( 4.5 sacks ) have the firepower to get Stafford off his game . Panthers 24 , Lions 21 . -- David Newton
Defending Cam Newton will be tough , and linebacker Luke Kuechly could cause Stafford some issues , but the Lions have shown they are one of the better teams in the NFC . They also have a good secondary , which already has five interceptions this season . These teams are evenly matched , so quarterback play could make the difference . In that case , at home , Stafford has the edge . The Lions ' defense gets another interception and Stafford throws for three touchdowns . Lions 28 , Panthers 20 -- Mike Rothstein

This is the second of three consecutive road games for the Niners , and they 're coming off a trio of games they lost by a combined eight points . Given the Colts ' struggles protecting the quarterback ( they 've allowed 14 sacks , tied for fifth most in the league ) and the Niners ' ability to take advantage of porous offensive lines ( nine sacks total against Seattle and Arizona ) , this would seem to be the type of game the 49ers can win . However , Indianapolis figures to be rocking as Peyton Manning is honored with a statue , and mobile signal-callers such as Jacoby Brissett have helped mitigate some of San Francisco 's pass-rush ability . This feels like it could go either way , but the edge goes to the home team . Colts 23 , 49ers 20 -- Nick Wagoner
The last thing the Colts can do is overlook the 49ers . The Colts ' three losses have come to the same three teams that San Francisco has lost to -- Arizona , Los Angeles Rams and Seattle -- and Indianapolis lost those games by a combined 68 points . The Colts , like in previous seasons , are struggling statistically on defense , ranking 31st overall . Things are lined up -- on paper at least -- for the 49ers to get their first victory of the season . But this will be an emotional weekend at Lucas Oil Stadium for the Colts . Peyton Manning is getting his own statue in front of the stadium and will have his jersey retired Sunday . Chuck Pagano has never started a season 1-4 as coach of the Colts . They 'll do just enough to keep things that way . Colts 21 , 49ers 17 -- Mike Wells
PickCenter
Marcus Mariota 's playing status could be unknown until Sunday , but the Titans have problems to solve even if he does find a way to play . The Titans ' pass defense was a disaster as the Titans gave up 57 points to the Texans in a Week 3 rout . And the Dolphins ' struggling offense presents three receivers who could give them fits once again . These two teams played last year in similar circumstances , with the Titans leaving with the victory due to Mariota 's four touchdowns and a stout running game . They 'll have to do it Sunday with a lot of attention on the running game , whether Mariota or Matt Cassel is under center . Dolphins 19 , Titans 17 -- Cameron Wolfe
The Dolphins allowed 235 rushing yards in last year 's loss to the Titans . However , Miami is vastly improved in that area , allowing just 3.1 yards per rush and 78 yards per game this season . If the Titans ca n't run , they are in trouble against the Dolphins , especially with the uncertainty of Mariota ( hamstring ) . Dolphins 17 , Titans 14 -- James Walker

The Chargers finished 1-3 on trips to the East Coast last season and are in the midst of a nine-game losing streak . So this is a game the Chargers normally would lose , which is why I 'm picking them to win -- along with the fact that I believe the Giants will have trouble stopping the Bolts ' talented pass-rushing duo of Melvin Ingram and Joey Bosa . Through the first four games , the Giants have played three different starting offensive line combinations up front . Chargers 20 , Giants 19 -- Eric Williams
The Giants are at home in a game they badly need to keep from imploding . It helps the Chargers are also winless ( 0-4 ) and ca n't run the ball ( 28th in NFL ) . The Giants have had trouble stopping the run , and it could be a problem again this week with Olivier Vernon and Jason Pierre-Paul struggling with injuries . But the Chargers are the right opponent at the right time . Eli Manning beats Philip Rivers for the first time in his career . Giants 24 , Chargers 23 -- Jordan Raanan

The Cardinals are 0-2 this season against NFC teams not in their division , but the biggest question mark will be whether the Cardinals can keep Carson Palmer on his feet . Arizona has given up 17 sacks while the Eagles have 10 on the season , but Palmer called the Eagles ' front seven one of the best he will face this year . However , Arizona 's primary hope for winning this game lies with its run defense . It 's ranked fourth in rushing yards allowed per play ( 3.2 ) , while the Eagles are ranked fifth in rushing yards gained per play ( 4.7 ) . Eagles 27 , Cardinals 17 -- Josh Weinfuss
Larry Fitzgerald long has tortured the Eagles , averaging six catches , 99 yards and more than a touchdown per game against them in seven meetings . Paired with fellow receivers John Brown and Jaron Brown , the Arizona wideouts pose a threat to a vulnerable Eagles cornerback group . With DT Fletcher Cox still working through a calf injury , there 's a chance Palmer will have a little more time to operate . If that 's the case , the Cardinals could pull off the upset . Cardinals 30 , Eagles 27 -- Tim McManus
PickCenter
It 's hard to know what the Jaguars are going to get from QB Blake Bortles each week , and this week may be even more of a mystery because the Jaguars may be without WR Marqise Lee because of a rib injury . That would mean bigger roles for undrafted rookie Keelan Cole ( four catches ) and recently signed first-year player Max McCaffrey . That will make it even harder for the Jaguars to do much in the passing game , especially downfield , to open things up for RB Leonard Fournette . Plus , the Jaguars gave up 256 yards rushing last week to the Jets and now face the league 's best back in Le'Veon Bell . If the Jaguars have the same kind of issues along the defensive front they did last week , it 'll be another long day . Steelers 24 , Jaguars 10 -- Mike DiRocco
The Steelers ' offense is poised to break out eventually ; Ben Roethlisberger has only one completion of more than 40 yards this season -- which came in Week 2 , his only home game . Big Ben 's 3-to-1 home-away touchdown ratio since 2015 looms large here , especially with Bell looking like his 2016 self and Jacksonville entering the week allowing 5.7 yards per carry , the league 's worst by a large margin . Plus , Antonio Brown is angry and wants the ball , which means he 's due for a big game . Steelers 27 , Jaguars 20 -- Jeremy Fowler

The Seahawks are coming off one of the more dominant halves of football they 've played under Pete Carroll , outscoring the Colts 36-3 and holding them to 32 yards in the second half last week . That was a reminder that their defense remains one of the NFL 's best . The offense remains a question mark , however , and could be without starting left tackle Rees Odhiambo because of a chest injury . Even at full strength , Seattle 's offensive line will have its hands full against a Rams front four that has given the Seahawks all sorts of trouble during the past few seasons . Russell Wilson 's QBR in five road games against the Rams is 48.6 compared to 71.5 in his 37 other road games . This has the makings of another close loss . Rams 24 , Seahawks 23 -- Brady Henderson
The Rams are feeling really good about themselves , coming off a big road win against the Cowboys . Their offense is clicking on all cylinders , and their defense finally showed signs of life in Sunday 's second half , holding Dallas to a mere six points . They 'll be energized , while at home against a tough division rival , and will sneak out another close win . Rams 23 , Seahawks 20 -- Alden Gonzalez

The Ravens catch a break with EJ Manuel starting at quarterback for the injured Derek Carr . But Joe Flacco 's struggles ( one touchdown in his last 28 drives ) and Baltimore 's poor history traveling out West ( five consecutive losses ) make it difficult to have any confidence in the Ravens . Raiders 20 , Ravens 13 -- Jamison Hensley
As easy as it would be to go with Baltimore -- the Raiders have converted just two of their past 24 third-down opportunities and are without starting QB Derek Carr -- the home crowd is the X factor , and so is the confidence Oakland has in Manuel . The Raiders opened the season with three of their first four games on the road . Expect the Raiders ' overachieving defense to make a play or two -- paging Khalil Mack and his four sacks -- to jump-start the offense , and all will be right in Silver and Blackdom ... for a week , at least . Raiders 23 , Ravens 16 -- Paul Gutierrez

Three key players from the Packers ' playoff victory over the Cowboys are gone -- Jared Cook ( the tight end who caught the sideline pass to set up the game-winning field goal ) , Micah Hyde ( the safety who had an interception ) and T.J. Lang ( the Pro Bowl guard who protected Aaron Rodgers ) . Sure , the Packers have found replacements for all three , but those were big-time players who performed in the clutch . They might miss them Sunday . Cowboys 27 , Packers 23 -- Rob Demovsky
For the second consecutive week , the Cowboys are facing a team with a 10-day break . The advantage for the Packers does not lie so much in the schematics , but the rest , which allowed four key offensive players more time to get ready . But it 's not like Rodgers needs time to get ready to face a Rod Marinelli-coached defense . Including playoffs , Rodgers has thrown 29 touchdown passes with just eight interceptions in 15 games . Most important , Rodgers is 13-2 in those games , dating back to 2008 . Packers 33 , Cowboys 27 -- Todd Archer

The Chiefs are 8-1 against quarterbacks in their first season as starters since Andy Reid arrived as head coach and Bob Sutton as defensive coordinator in 2013 . That does n't mean they 'll have an easy time against Houston rookie QB Deshaun Watson . They 'll give up some yards and some plays . But they 'll defeat him as they have other young quarterbacks except for Oakland 's Derek Carr as a rookie in 2014 . Chiefs 24 , Texans 20 -- Adam Teicher
Deshaun Watson and the Texans ' offense made a big statement scoring 57 points against the Titans . But this week , players and coaches have been quick to say that was one game and the Chiefs present a different challenge . Watson will continue to play well , but the Texans ' defense will have a tough time containing the speed Kansas City has on offense . Chiefs 27 , Texans 20 -- Sarah Barshop
PickCenter
The Vikings ' defense aims to take advantage of Mitchell Trubisky 's inexperience at quarterback by disguising coverages and playing hide-and-seek with its blitzes . There 's not a whole lot of tape out there on Trubisky , which is a disadvantage for Minnesota in game planning . Since Chicago is n't a huge threat with its receivers , the defense will focus on Tarik Cohen and Jordan Howard in the run game . If Sam Bradford makes it through three days of practice this week and is ready to play , he will start in Chicago . And regardless of who 's at quarterback , Adam Thielen and Stefon Diggs need to spark the Vikings ' aerial attack early while the run game gets in its groove with Latavius Murray taking the reins for an injured Dalvin Cook . Vikings 20 , Bears 17 -- Courtney Cronin
The Bears are 14-2 in their past 16 home games against the Vikings dating back to the 2001 season . But Minnesota 's defense is tough . The Vikings sacked Lions quarterback Matthew Stafford six times in a losing effort last week . Overall , Minnesota is tied for eighth in points allowed ( 19.0 ) and third in rushing yards allowed ( 71.3 ) . There 's a ton of excitement in Chicago about Trubisky -- and rightfully so . But Trubisky is making his first career start on Monday Night Football . No one really knows what to expect . The Vikings are banged up on offense but probably still good enough to squeak out a close victory . Vikings 27 , Bears 26 -- Jeff Dickerson
The European Commission said on Friday it had conducted inspections in some EU states over banks ' alleged anti-competitive practices in limiting rival financial firms from accessing information about their customers ' accounts .
BRUSSELS : The European Commission said on Friday it had conducted inspections in some EU states into banks ' alleged anti-competitive practices in limiting rival financial firms from gaining legitimate online access to their customers ' data .
The Commission said in a statement it had `` concerns '' that the companies involved `` may have engaged in anti-competitive practices in breach of EU antitrust rules '' . It did not name any company .
It said that banks could have prevented non-bank competitors from gaining online access to account information of their customers to provide financial services , in spite of having obtained prior authorisation from the customers .
The unannounced inspections were carried out on Oct. 3 , the commission said . Antitrust inspections are preliminary steps into suspected practices that may not result in formal accusations .
Financial technology , or `` fintech '' companies had complained of banks limiting their access to customers . Fintech firms provide payment , lending and other services .

A Bristol school which went into lock down after it received a hoax bomb threat has spoken out .
Pupils at Bristol Free School were kept in their classrooms and searched by police after a hoax was made to the school on Monday morning .
The threats , which came on email , are being investigated by Avon and Somerset police , but a spokesman confirmed they were being treated as a hoax at this stage .
The email is thought to have come from the United States and been sent to hundreds of schools around the country . Five schools in the wider Bristol region have been affected .
Parents at Bristol Free School were told about the incident around 1.30pm . An email sent out to parents was shared with the Bristol Post .
It read : “ Dear parent/carer , you may be aware that in common with a large number of schools nationwide , we have been dealing with a hoax communication this morning .
“ Although we believed it to be a hoax , we erred on the side of caution and immediately contacted the police .
“ A similar response has been made by headteachers across the country .
“ Police attended promptly , have been working with the school and are confident that there is no risk to students or staff .
“ With this in mind , school will continue as usual until 3pm .
“ Also , any scheduled clubs or period 7 sessions will run as usual .
“ Thank you for your cooperation . ”
A spokesman for Avon and Somerset police said : “ We are being made aware of threats made to five schools today , March 19 .
“ These threats are being treated as hoaxes at this stage but we are thoroughly investigating each one .
“ The police take hoaxes extremely seriously . They divert police resources and cause disruption and alarm to the public .
“ Enquiries continue to establish the facts and forces are working together to investigate who is responsible . ”

The FCC has taken the final steps toward finally opening its long-delayed Connect America Fund II , which will disburse $ 2 billion in federal money over 10 years to support new broadband infrastructure in rural areas throughout the country . A date for bidding and the final documentation of the process were finally released today — though a bit of official infighting acted as a reminder that not all is well at the agency .
CAF II works like many other government reverse auctions — the agency or whoever publicize the tasks and locations it will subsidize work in , and companies submit bids to fulfill them . In this case the task is deploying broadband and the location is thousands of census units outside of the generally well-served urban areas . You can view a full map here , but the excerpt below is representative :
The purple parts are census “ groups ” that would be bid on while the orange parts are census blocks that would need to be served . That means you ca n't just serve one or two of the most lucrative ones .
Accelerating CAF II is one of the FCC 's legitimate claims to progress over the last year , which it rightfully gave pole position in Chairman Pai 's highly selective summary of the agency 's 2017 accomplishments . The fund was proposed back in 2013 , but for various reasons never saw the light of day . Pai made it an official priority of his upon taking the Chairman office , and to his credit he and the others have made good on his promise to get it out the door in 2018 .
“ With our decisions today , we jump the last big hurdle before holding a first-of-its-kind universal service reverse auction , ” said Chairman Pai in an accompanying statement . “ And I 'll remind
everyone that CAF II is only the beginning . In 2019 , we will move on to the Remote Areas Fund for
those areas still without high-speed broadband . Rural America has waited long enough . ”
The Connect America Fund auction will take place in July , but if you 're a broadband provider ( or aspire to be one ) you 'll need to indicate your intention to participate by the end of March , presumably so there 's plenty of time for vetting and getting all the necessary paperwork settled .
The decision to go ahead was met with nearly unanimous agreement by the various Commissioners , who all filed their own statements .
“ This effort has been many years in the making . It 's exciting—because with these decisions we are taking steps into the future of high-cost universal service , ” wrote Commissioner Rosenworcel , who has had some choice words for other agency decisions recently . “ We are experimenting with new opportunities for providers to build broadband in some of our most rural communities that have been among our most challenging places to serve . This forward-thinking effort has my support . ”
With hundreds of millions yearly planned to go out the door to local broadband deployment firms and their friends in infrastructure , we could see some real improvements to connectivity off the beaten paths , though it will take time .
Back to business as usual
It 's good that the FCC still functions well for this kind of important work , but a significant detail led to a bit of inter-office conflict that reminds us that this is still a sharply divided office .
Commissioner Clyburn noted in her accompanying statement that “ despite our unified desire as a Commission to spur deployment on Tribal lands , we do not take any action here , ” although Tribal lands in rural areas are disproportionately less connected .
“ What 's the hold up ? ” she asked in a separate statement . “ Chairman Pai repeatedly claims that closing the digital divide is among his top priorities , yet nearly a year has elapsed since a proposal was first put forward to help improve connectivity for Native communities and still no action . ”
Pai responded , saying that an order to increase federal funding for development in Tribal areas had been presented last February :
So what was the hold up ? Despite having formally voted for the item , Commissioner Clyburn 's office had privately and repeatedly threatened to withdraw her critical third vote in favor of the order if we moved to bring this item across the finish line . It is worth noting that her threat had nothing to do with what is actually contained in the order . Then , this morning , she carried through on that threat and withdrew her critical third vote in favor of the order . If Commissioner Clyburn believes as I do that the Commission should take action to expand broadband access on Tribal lands , the way forward is simple . Instead of quietly changing her vote on a Friday morning and issuing a Friday afternoon press release designed to shift the blame , she should cast her vote in favor of an order that will increase federal funding for broadband infrastructure on Tribal lands . It 's that simple .
Not one to let Pai have the last word , Clyburn shot back :
Maybe I missed it . I thought my role as Acting Chair of the Federal Communications Commission ( FCC ) ended in November 2013 ? But if the authority implied by Chairman Pai 's statement is one I possess , then the Tribal broadband item would be adopted by close of business today . Correction : I did not withdraw my vote . My vote on the initial item was cast seven months ago and in case you missed it , I 'm currently in the minority . I 'm the holdup ? How is voting to approve the entire text of the item but dissenting in part , as I did today , because it did not go far enough to support our tribal communities , delaying the vote ?
I await Chairman Pai 's retort .

The Trump Administration is giving insurance companies an extra three weeks to decide whether to offer insurance plans through the Affordable Care Act markets , and how much to charge .
The extension comes as insurance companies wait for Trump to decide whether he will continue to make payments to insurance companies that are called for under the Affordable Care Act , but that some Republicans have opposed .
The payments – known as cost-sharing reduction payments – reimburse insurance companies for discounts on copayments and deductibles that they 're required by law to offer to low-income customers . The Congressional Budget Office estimates the payments this year would be about $ 7 billion .
Trump has said he may end the reimbursements , which he calls “ bailouts , ” and has been leaving insurers to wonder month-to-month about whether they will receive a check .
A White House spokesman says Trump is “ working with his staff and his cabinet to consider the issues raised by the CSR payments . ”
The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services says it 's offering the extra time so insurance companies can plan ahead in case the government decides to end the payments . In a memo Friday , the agency said many states are now requiring companies to file their rates for 2018 on the assumption that they wo n't be reimbursed .
Several companies say that without the cost-sharing payments , their rates will see double-digit increases . For example , Blue Cross Blue Shield of North Carolina says ending the payments would push its rates up 14.1 percent .
The HHS memo says “ there have been no changes regarding HHS 's ability to make cost-sharing reduction payments to insurers . ”
But it then says the agency intends to change the ACA 's risk adjustment program to compensate for the loss of cost-sharing payments .
The changes are technical and complex , but Timothy Jost , professor emeritus at Washington & Lee University 's law school , says in a Health Affairs blog that the memo just deepens the confusion .
“ We still do not know if all of this is needed or not — the Trump administration has not made up its mind , ” he says .
The cost-sharing payments have been at the center of a political battle over the Affordable Care Act since before President Trump took office .
House Republicans opposed to the health law sued then-President Obama , saying the payments are illegal because Congress had n't appropriated money for them . A judge agreed but allowed the administration to continue making the payments during an appeal .
Now that Trump is in the White House , and Republican efforts to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act have failed , many Republicans are urging the president to continue the payments rather than undermine the health care markets .
The new year is a time to reflect on the past and resolve to make positive change in the future . As I reflect on an issue that is of utmost importance to many coastal communities —coastal restoration —I am somewhat saddened that the primary solution offered by our state leadership has been to encourage lawyers to file hasty and ill-conceived lawsuits in hopes of a big , quick payday and a potential fill for some budget holes .
The truth is that we already have a restoration plan in place , and it 's currently being funded in large part by the very companies these lawsuits are attacking . These lawsuits are the absolute wrong approach to addressing this problem , and in fact , they may make the problem worse .
The oil and gas industry , which remains the cornerstone of our economy in South Louisiana , has simply followed the rules as set out by decades ' worth of existing law . The industry has done everything required by law to legally operate on our coast . Companies go through exhaustive scrutiny and only receive final permitting after agreeing to a rigorous administrative process set up to enforce these permits . If there have been violations of those permits or that process , the state Department of Natural Resources should and does vigorously pursue those that break the law . As in all matters , a lawsuit should be the last recourse , not the first .
The complicated issue of coastal land subsidence is a factor that many from the geologic and scientific community believe is the greatest cause of land loss . Louisiana 's coastline has been evolving for thousands of years . The fault lines far below our surface are continually shifting , adding to and taking away large masses of land . In addition to this is the fact that virtually every expert recognizes the governmentally-approved levee system as a factor in inhibiting the natural distribution of soil and silt that fed our coastline for centuries .
But , while all these experts acknowledge the issues are multi-faceted and increasingly complex , there remain those opportunists whose solution is simply a legal shakedown of a critical industry . The real disappointment is that environmentalists and coastal governing bodies , knowing that industry dollars are funding the current restoration programs , should actually be the greatest supporters of our oil and gas sector . Attacking these industry partners with lawsuits removes any incentive they have for operating or expanding in our state , thus removing new funding sources and reducing future payments from any equation .
As we look enthusiastically to a new year , let us resolve to find solutions for coastal restoration through sound science , not shakedowns . And , may we all recognize it is time for cooperation and compromise , not contentious and costly lawsuits .

President Uhuru Kenyatta and NASA Leader Raila Odinga today morning wowed the nation with their passionate hug as they promised to ensure the nation stands .
The two were called up on the podium by U.S . Senator James Mountain Inhofe , Senator from Oklahoma who said Kenya needed leaders like Uhuru and Raila to see its growth .
“ The prayer for us right now is that Jesus will heal our land and our hearts ” said Sen. Inhofe as the stood right before him , listening attentively .
He said the unity of a nation requires dedicated leaders who believe in one course , that is ‘ uniting the country ' without thinking about themselves .
He then told the two show the world how united they were if they mean their business , that is to unite the country . It is at this juncture that the President and the Former Prime Minister shook hands and hugged to the amusement of the audience that included Deputy President William Ruto .
The audience cheered loudly as the two walked down the podium to take their seats in a brotherly way , just like their fathers the late Mzee Jaramogi Oginga Odinga and the late Mzee Jomo Kenyatta embraced each other in the 60 's when Kenya was born .
“ When members from different parties pray together even if they have different opinions ; it is difficult for them to be angry at each other ” said Sen. Inhofe .
The 16th National Prayer Breakfast , organized by Parliament ( Senate and the National Assembly ) has brought together guests from far and wide . Delegations from Ethiopia , South Sudan , DRC , South Africa , Rwanda , U.K , Somalia among others in attendance .

Jamie Foxx has said he helped the fledgling Ed Sheeran by letting him stay on his sofa for several weeks to allow him to practise his craft .
The Oscar-winning star , 49 , said on Wednesday that he quickly knew that the British musician was going to be `` something special '' .
Foxx told the Press Association : `` He sought me out , came to my house , he slept on my couch for , like , about a few weeks .
`` I took him down to a live night to see him perform in front of a raucous crowd , he pops out with a ukulele , gets a standing ovation and I knew right there he was going to be something special .
`` That 's what we all do as artists , you know . He needed a place to stay , and work on his craft and be left alone .
`` So I would give him food , let him work on his music and my daughter looked in on him and said , 'That guy 's about to be the next guy ' . ''
Sheeran , 26 , played on The Foxxhole , the actor 's radio channel , in 2010 .
Foxx , speaking at the Los Angeles premiere of Baby Driver , said he has also put up musicians such as rapper Nick Cannon and Ne-Yo .
`` My house is that type of house for artists , '' he added .

Bryan Fuller can not catch a damn break . After cutting his teeth on Star Trek : Voyager , Fuller started creating some of the most inventive series on television , such as Dead As Me , Wonderfalls , and Pushing Daisies , all of which were cancelled before he and his creative team got to fully explore the narrative worlds or their underlying thematic ideas . He also wrote and worked as a consulting producer on Heroes , and you can see his fingerprints all over that botches series ' best episodes . This is all the more devastating considering just how radical and evocative his longest-running series , Hannibal , ended up being by the end of its third season .
And yet , the unmitigated brilliant he showed there was n't enough to save his job at either Star Trek : Discovery or American Gods , the latter of which was one of the very best seasons of TV to be released last year . Fuller and his longtime collaborator , Michael Green , were fired from American Gods over budget issues , leading to a long hunt for a replacement showrunner to work with source author Neil Gaiman on season two . That search ended yesterday , when Jesse Alexander was announced as the lead showrunner on the show 's second season . Surprisingly , Alexander is also a Fuller collaborator , having worked on Hannibal with him , as well as a producer on Lost , Alias , and Heroes .
The second season of American Gods was originally expected to premiere in early 2019 , but the search for a showrunner has likely put that back to at least summer 2019 , if not fall . Regardless , one should not lose hope that American Gods will remain as satisfying and ambitious in its second season . Fuller and Green already penned half of the season before being fired from the project , so at least the general narrative will continue to explore sex , religion , romance , death , familial relations , and the metaphysical with the same wild abandon that made the first season so riveting . The imagery might not be quite as inventive or cleverly revealing , but American Gods will survive for now , which is all good news on this end .
Joe Thomas is moving on from professional football , and he wants you to know that while yes , the frequent losses took their toll , he never lost his sense of humor .
The six-time All-Pro made sure of that Monday by setting the tone of his retirement presser with a litany of playful jabs at a list of men with whom Thomas worked during his career in Cleveland . Among those included : former quarterback Johnny Manziel ( `` Johnny tried to call me from the club , but his money phone apparently did n't have very good service '' ) , GM Ray Farmer ( a text message joke was made ) , coach Eric Mangini , GM Sashi Brown ( `` tried to trade some information with me about my retirement , but unfortunately it did n't get in in time '' ) , quarterback Brandon Weeden ( `` he tried to call me but he ended up still being stuck under that giant American flag '' ) and quarterback Robert Griffin III , on whom Thomas jokingly blamed his retirement . More importantly , Thomas made everyone aware that his career was about more than wins and losses .
The rock of the Browns for more than a decade , Thomas saw his most successful season in terms of team achievement arrive in his first as a professional . The Browns went 10-6 and narrowly missed the playoffs , and did n't so much as sniff such success for the next 10 years . All the while , though , Thomas remained as effective and reliable as ever , making 10 straight Pro Bowls and amassing a consecutive snap streak of 10,363 , even while dealing with a variety of injuries previously undisclosed . For Thomas , it was fitting that he waited until his retirement to admit he was banged up -- he never complained , after all .
Perhaps no one in professional sports has done more with less : Thomas , a `` surefire Hall of Famer '' as Browns owner Jimmy Haslam called him Monday , built a legendary career amid so much mediocrity . He blocked for over 20 quarterbacks during his career , and Cleveland won just 48 of a possible 176 games . Unsurprisingly , Thomas admitted he 'll miss the locker room most , but also received an open invitation from Haslam and coach Hue Jackson to spend time around the team whenever he 'd like . It 's the least they could do for a player who dedicated his career to a team that repeatedly struggled to shift out of first gear , and to a city who embraced him from the moment he was drafted .
`` From the day that I got here , I really embraced Cleveland . I fell in love with the city , the people , the fans , '' Thomas told NFL Network 's Dan Hellie and Shaun O'Hara during a Monday appearance on NFL Total Access . `` To feel that love reciprocated even 11 years after my rookie season here , it really feels awesome . To hear the team say those things about me is really cool .
`` Most players that leave the game , they take away their keyfob the day that they leave the team and they 're forgotten about within a couple of weeks . To get that invitation from Hue and from Jimmy and Dee to be able to still be around the team and help out in any way I can really feel special . ''
With his early jabs , he got out in front of potential questions about Cleveland 's ineptitude at his farewell gathering . From there , he shifted to giving thanks , listing scores of people associated with the Browns from 2007 to 2018 . He named six -- yes , six -- head coaches for whom he played , and even more general managers .
He also recalled his fondest memories as a Brown : Cleveland 's thrilling overtime win over Baltimore in 2007 , the Brian Hoyer-led , record-setting comeback over Tennessee in 2014 , Jerome Harrison 's and Josh Cribbs ' historic romp against Kansas City in 2009 , Josh Gordon 's individual receiving explosion in 2013 and even LeBron James congratulating him on his career achievements in a tweet .
Thomas did n't shed a tear until a local beat reporter grabbed a microphone to open the round of questions and thanked him for the example he set as a professional amid seemingly constant chaos within the Browns organization . That same franchise thanked the player who skipped the draft to go fishing with his father by gifting him a custom fishing rod on Monday .
Thomas gave vague answers when asked what 's next , propping up his popular podcast `` The ThomaHawk Show '' ( with fellow former Brown Andrew Hawkins ) by mentioning its No . 1 ranking atop the iTunes chart before talking about keeping his doors open . He 'll likely step into a broadcasting role somewhere soon , given his charismatic nature , wealth of knowledge and football pedigree .
Where that will be , we 'll find out in the coming weeks or months . But five years from now , it 's all but guaranteed he 'll be getting measured for his gold jacket , as he delivers the franchise its greatest achievement from their time together : the newest Brown to be enshrined in the Pro Football Hall of Fame .
American ceramics artist Shawanda Corbett , who was born without both legs and one arm , shapes clay with one hand .
The African-American artist recently attended the `` Lathe and Free Shaping Workshop , '' organized by the Ceramics and Glass Department of Kastamonu University Fine Arts and Design Faculty . Speaking to Anadolu Agency ( AA ) , Corbett said though she was born this way , she has overcome all the challenges instead of surrendering . Currently , she is pursuing a doctoral degree at Oxford University .
She said that she has been using ceramics as a medium since her undergraduate years .
Noting she likes difficult things , Corbett said : `` In my freshman year , I was in the paintings department . We had a summer course on ceramics . The difficulties I had with shaping clay pushed me further to pursue ceramics . Whatever I have learned in the fields of film , photography and art philosophy , I try to transfer to my ceramic works . ''
`` It is very difficult to do something with one hand that people usually do with both hands . My professors also faced some difficulties while teaching me because they had never worked with some who has only one hand . Other people could learn much easier than me . But , I worked very hard and overcame all the difficulties , '' she said .
Positive attitude in Turkey
Talking about the positive reception she got in Turkey and in Kastamonu , Corbett said : `` I have lived in the U.S. and the U.K . I have witnessed a lot of discrimination and hate speech towards people with disabilities there . But , in Turkey , I have only got positive receptions . No one asked me anything about my physical condition . It was not a problem for anyone . ''
`` I was n't given any opportunity in the U.S. or the U.K. to organize a workshop , as they thought I would not be able to manage it myself . But , I am really happy to have received this opportunity in Turkey . I want to thank everyone who contributed to the workshop . I will return to the U.S. with very good feelings , '' she said .
Corbett added that everyone can face difficulties in their lives but the condition of people with disabilities is more difficult . `` No matter if the society accepts it or not , no matter if people believe in you or not , do not let anybody tell that you can not do something . Do not expect them to support you , as well . What you want to do is wait for you . You can do it as long as you want it . I felt this energy here . Turkish people always want to give something . It is in their character . I am not talking about physical gifts only . They are good at expressing emotions and love , '' she said .
In the future , Corbett wants to continue working as a freelance artist , and train people with physical disabilities in art .

Geoffrey Kirui pulled away from Galen Rupp over the last few miles , winning the men 's division of the 121st Boston Marathon on Monday and ending Rupp 's bid to become the first American winner since 2014 . In the women 's division , Edna Kiplagat made the most of her first appearance in the Boston Marathon , separating from the pack at the 18-mile mark and cruising to a victory .
Kirui , a 24-year-old runner from Kenya , won in 2:09:37 on a warm day in Boston . Rupp , the Olympic bronze medalist in the event , finished second in his first big-city American marathon in 2:09:58 and Suguru Osako of Japan was third in 2:10:28 . In his three marathons , Rupp has finished first ( in the Olympic trials ) , third and second . “ It lived up to and exceeded all my expectations , ” Rupp told NBC . “ ( The crowd ) really lifted me those last three miles . ”
Kirui , a convert from track , called Rupp “ a strong guy , ” and admitted that he tested him for 500 meters to see how the Portland , Oregon , native would respond . Now , after the win , he acknowledged in broken English , “ I try too many times in track , but I think my future is in the marathon . ”
One of the more emotional scenes of the day occurred when Meb Keflezighi crossed the finish line . Keflezighi won the men 's division of the first marathon after the 2013 bombings , becoming the first American winner since 1983 . He has said this will be his final Boston appearance at the age of 41 ; his last , the 26th of his career , will come at the New York Marathon . He finished in 2:17:01 , citing heat as one factor .
Keflezighi headed over to shake the hand of the father of Martin Richard , the 8-year-old who was killed in the 2013 bombings . The two have become close , he said , and he acknowledged that he 'll always be linked to the victims because of his emotional 2014 win .
WATCH :
Speaking Earth , or Haqa'pa'ninam ( Hackalth-palth-knee-nam ) , the Ktunaxa tourism experience that had been in the works for nearly 20 years , had its inaugural weekend from May 25 to 27 .
“ Pretty much through all the feedback that we received from everyone that took part in it , it was a big success , ” said Jared Teneese , business and product development coordinator with the Traditional Knowledge and Language Sector ( TKL ) at St. Eugene .
“ We realized that we have a world-class product and it met the standards of everyone that was here and it me the standards that we push out to have in the beginning . Everybody thought it was a positive experience . ”
One of the key components that will ensure the experience 's future success is its organizers ' adaptability and willingness to hear and learn from their guests .
For example , initially the package was intended to be a five day , four night excursions that took participants all over the traditional Ktunaxa territory — from St. Eugene to Ainsworth to Invermere .
“ So we had a very wide circle tour , but when we brought it to Canada 's West [ Marketplace — a tourism trade show in Banff ] , a lot of the buyers are saying it was too long , ” Teneese said . “ Too long , people do n't have enough time to commit to that , they wanted short intervals of stuff , so over a lunch period we changed the program . ”

Teneese said that they retooled their programming and made it so it was centred out of St. Eugene , and people could commit to the full weekend , or individual components of the experience .
“ When we start going to other places you start having to worry about , well , are they going to hold the standards we do ? Not saying they wo n't , but we have extremely high standards for our program and what we offer and when you start adding in other people you do n't have control over that . ”
However , when they brought the program to Rendezvous Canada [ a Canadian international tourism marketplace ] they found that there are indeed people out there that actually want the longer iteration of the program .
Fortunately , they are already set up for that , and can accommodate it if the need be .
“ So we have the best of both markets , ” Teneese said .
Additionally , after this first weekend , they had things that were n't in the planned programming , that wound up greatly adding to the experience of their guests .
“ The teepee raising — that was never part of our program , that just happened due to our cultural assistants wanting to add in something that they were good at and that was raising those tipis . ”
Teneese said that going forward , that would be something they 'd like to add to the program .
Registration , including several more discount days are still available , which gives people the opportunity to come in and try it for a little bit cheaper .
Teneese explained that what they feel is really going to sell the program is the people who experience it firsthand and share it with others .

Months after the death of Sudan , the world 's last male northern white rhino , scientists said Wednesday they have grown embryos containing DNA of his kind , hoping to save the subspecies from extinction .
With only two northern white rhino ( NWR ) known to be alive today — both infertile females — the team hopes their breakthrough technique will lead to the re-establishment of a viable NWR breeding population .
`` Our goal is to have in three years the first NWR calf born , '' Thomas Hildebrandt , head of reproduction management at the Leibniz Institute for Zoo and Wildlife Research in Berlin , told journalists of the work .
`` Taking into account 16 months ( of ) pregnancy , we have a little more than a year to have a successful implantation . ''
The team 's work , using a recently-patented , two-meter ( 6.6-foot ) egg extraction device , resulted in the first-ever test tube-produced rhino embryos .
Now frozen , these `` have a very high chance to establish a pregnancy once implanted into a surrogate mother , '' said Hildebrandt .
The hybrid embryos were created with frozen sperm from dead NWR males and the eggs of southern white rhino ( SWR ) females , of which there are thousands left on Earth .
The eggs were harvested from rhinos in European zoos .
The team now hopes to use the technique to collect eggs from the last two northern white rhinos — Najin and Fatu , the daughter and granddaughter of Sudan . They live in a Kenyan national park .
Risk and reward
By fertilizing these with northern white rhino sperm and implanting the resulting embryos in surrogate southern white rhino females , the team intends to create a new , fledgling NWR population .
`` Our results indicate that ART ( assisted reproduction techniques ) could be a viable strategy to rescue genes from the iconic , almost extinct , northern white rhinoceros , '' the team wrote in the journal Nature Communications .
The researchers have sought permission to harvest eggs from Najin and Fatu in Kenya , hopefully before the end of the year .
But the procedure is not without risk : `` we have to do a full anesthesia , the animal is down for two hours , and it is quite a risky situation '' for the last two of their kind , conceded Hildebrandt .
`` We are highly afraid something unexpected would happen , that would be a nightmare . ''
In the meantime , the team will practice , implanting some of their hybrid embryos into SWR surrogates `` to test the system '' .
Any hybrids born as a result may play a crucial future role as surrogates , sharing more genes with northern rhinos than purely southern surrogates .
There is , however , a key obstacle to the team 's envisaged NWR repopulation .
With only two NWR females left and all the available semen from only four dead males , ART alone would likely lead to a population without the genetic diversity required for a species to thrive .
Can it work ?
To this end , the researchers hope to use stem cell technology to engineer eggs and sperm from the frozen skin cells of 12 dead northern white rhinos , unrelated to one another .
`` This would enlarge the founding diversity of the future NWR population substantially , '' the team said in a statement .
There is time pressure , they pointed out , with only two animals still around to socialize the babies in the mysterious ways of northern white rhinos .
`` It is a motivating aspect to succeed as soon a possible so the calf that we produce can grow up with Najin and Fatu , '' said Hildebrandt .
Terri Roth and William Swanson of the Cincinnati Zoo and Botanical Garden , in a comment on the study , said ART alone can not save a species from extinction .
`` Impressive results in a Petri dish do n't easily translate into a herd of healthy offspring , '' wrote the duo , not involved in the research .
`` Achieving the latter requires navigating an untrodden path fraught with obstacles , and it remains unlikely that a viable population of northern white rhinos will be restored . ''
For the researchers , however , a combination of ART and stem cell techniques , could `` provide a blueprint on how to save highly endangered species that have already dwindled to numbers that make conventional conservation efforts impossible . ''

UNITED NATIONS There are no apparent plans by Arab states to propose that names from their Qatar blacklist be subjected to United Nations sanctions , diplomats said on Wednesday , a likely difficult move that would need approval by the 15-member U.N. Security Council . Saudi Arabia , the United Arab Emirates ( UAE ) , Egypt and Bahrain on Friday branded 59 people , including Muslim Brotherhood spiritual leader Yousef al-Qaradawi , as terrorists and 12 entities , among them Qatari-funded charities Qatar Charity and Eid Charity , as having links to terrorism.The move came days after the four Arab states severed relations with Qatar , accusing it of supporting Islamist militants and their arch-adversary Iran , charges Qatar rejects . Several other countries followed suit.At least six of the people on the Arab states blacklist are already named on the U.N. Security Council al Qaeda and Islamic State sanctions list , which subjects them to a global asset freeze , travel ban and arms embargo .
The U.N. Security Council has imposed sanctions on al Qaeda , Islamic State , the Taliban and related groups and people with ties to them . Iran is also subjected to a U.N. arms embargo.The Arab states would need to link people or entities on their blacklist to those U.N. sanctioned groups or to breaches of the Iran arms embargo if they wanted to propose that they be subjected to U.N. sanctions .
For any names to be added to U.N. sanctions lists the Security Council can either agree by consensus behind closed doors or vote on a resolution , which would need nine votes in favor and no vetoes by the United States , Britain , France , Russia or China.The biggest diplomatic rift in years among the rich states of the Gulf has become a major test for the United States , which is closely allied to the countries on both sides . Qatar hosts the Middle East headquarters for U.S. air forces ; Bahrain hosts the main base for the U.S. Navy .
The United Nations has said it is only bound by the U.N. Security Council sanctions lists and therefore any work with Qatar Charity was unaffected by the Arab states ' blacklist . `` The Qatar Charity implements projects included in the U.N.-coordinated Humanitarian Response Plans in Yemen , in Syria , and in Iraq , where they also participate in the common humanitarian coordination structure , '' U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said . He said the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs does `` not provide funding for them and we do not receive funding from them .

BUFFALO , N.Y. ( WIVB ) — Jaylen Adams scored a career-high 40 points and hit a career-best eight 3-pointers to lift St. Bonaventure to an 84-81 road win over the Duquense Saturday night .
Tied at 81 in the final seconds , Adams connected on his eighth 3-pointer of the night to give the Bonnies an 84-81 lead .
The 40 points were the most scored by an opponent at the Polumbo Center as the Bonnies picked up their fourth straight win to improve to 15-6 overall and 5-4 in Atlantic-10 play .
St. Bonaventure returns to the court Wednesday when they host Saint Louis at the Reilly Center . Tip off is set for 7:00 p.m .
A new US study suggests that for women in their 40s , high blood pressure could be a risk factor linked to developing dementia.Led by Rachel A Whitmer , PhD , of Kaiser Permanente Division of Research in Oakland , California , the research looked at 7,238 men and women who were part of the Kaiser Permanente Northern California health care system.The participants all had blood pressure checks and other tests from 1964 to 1973 when they were an average age of 33 , and then again when they were an average age of 44.Around 22 percent of the participants had high blood pressure in their 30s ( 31 percent of men and 14 percent of women ) and around 22 percent also had high blood pressure in their 40s , however by this time the figure for men had decreased to 25 percent , while the number of women had increased to 18 percent.Next , the team followed participants for 15 years to see who went on to develop dementia.The results showed that high blood pressure in early adulthood or during the 30s was not associated with increased risk of dementia.However , women who developed high blood pressure in their 40s were 73 percent more likely to develop dementia than women who had stable , normal blood pressure throughout their 30s and 40s.The team also found that for women who made it to age 60 without developing dementia , the cumulative 25-year risk of developing the condition was 21 percent for those who had high blood pressure in their 30s , compared to 18 percent for those who had normal blood pressure in their 30s.The results still held true even after the researchers had taken into account other factors that could affect risk of dementia , such as smoking , diabetes and body mass index . `` High blood pressure in midlife is a known risk factor for dementia , but these results may help us better understand when this association starts , how changes in blood pressure affect the risk of dementia and what the differences are between men and women , '' said Whitmer , commenting on the findings . `` Even though high blood pressure was more common in men , there was no evidence that having high blood pressure in one 's 30s or 40s increased the risk of dementia for men , '' Whitmer said . `` More research is needed to identify the possible sex-specific pathways through which the elevated blood pressure accelerates brain aging . ''
When Kirstin Bird-Lamoureux wanted to plan her daughter 's ninth birthday party , she thought of iSaute .
The popular trampoline centre recently opened a new location in Kirkland , and the mother of three thought it would be a perfect place to celebrate .
“ Before I gave the deposit , I had to sign a waiver , ” said Bird-Lamoureux . “ In that waiver , it said that pictures , any pictures that were taken on the premise could be used for their social media and for their advertisements . ”
READ MORE : New stores expected to revitalize Kirkland 's RioCan Shopping Centre
In a section of iSaute 's waiver , it reads : “ I assign the rights to iSaute to use my likeness and image or that of the Minor Child in its publications on its website , in promotional and marketing tools or in any other media , whether it be digital or printed or other and this , without any form of payment or compensation or need for any other approval or consent and I release all rights to iSaute pertaining to the said Footage . ”
Bird-Lamoureux says , the parents of her daughter 's friends would also be asked to sign that waiver , and she was n't comfortable with that .
“ The manager said , if I refused to sign the section on the pictures then the waiver would not continue — I could n't move it the next page — so it 's null and void , ” she said .
That means , she could n't host the party at iSaute .
ISaute co-owner , Natalie Lundquist is defending the waiver .
She said the photography clause serves as a protection for them , their employees and their customers .
“ We have thousands of customers that come through our parks on a daily basis and everyone is taking pictures and posting them on social media , ” she said . “ We ca n't control what pictures are being taken of whom , we ca n't control who has given those rights and who has n't . So this is the easiest way for us as a business , employees and customers , to make sure everyone is protected . ”

Lundquist says if iSaute wants to take photos or video , they always make sure to get additional consent from their clients on top of the waiver .
Commercial lawyer , Michael Vathilakis says , as a private business , iSaute can put together whatever waiver they want , and the user always has the right to go to a different facility . But he still questions the clause .
“ It 's an odd clause , in that you 're denying someone the right to jump or use your facility because they do n't want to be in your publication or video , ” he said . “ That does n't make any sense to me . ”
Regardless , Bird-Lamoureux said she and her family have decided to throw her daughter a pool party at their house instead .
JERUSALEM : Israel announced on Tuesday ( Apr 24 ) it has abandoned controversial plans to expel African migrants who entered the Jewish state illegally , after failing to find a country willing to host them .
The plan had targeted some 42,000 migrants of Eritrean and Sudanese origin currently living in Israel and denied refugee status .
Government legal advisers informed the Supreme Court of the plan 's cancellation after certain unspecified countries refused to host the migrants , a government source said .
`` At this stage , the possibility of removal to a third country is no longer relevant , '' the advisers said in a statement .
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had previously mentioned Rwanda as a possible host country and , earlier this month , Uganda said it was `` considering '' an Israeli proposal to accept the deportees .
The deportation plan has attracted a wave of criticism , including from the UN refugee agency , Holocaust survivors , and parts of Israeli civil society .

The government originally announced a plan under which it would present migrants with US $ 3,500 ( €2,800 ) and the opportunity to leave on their own accord , or face indefinite imprisonment with eventual forced expulsion .
In early April , Netanyahu agreed to cancel the plan , saying a new agreement with the UN would allow 16,000 migrants to be transferred to `` developed countries like Canada , Germany or Italy '' .
In exchange , Israel would give residency to an equal number of migrants .
But the premier cancelled the plan several hours later , after caving to pressure from his right-wing base .
'REOPEN DETENTION CENTRES '
Shortly after news of Tuesday 's cancellation broke , Netanyahu tweeted that he had instructed Interior Minister Aryeh Deri `` to immediately prepare for the reopening of the detention facilities to the infiltrators '' and to set up `` means to find a solution to the problem '' .
The prime minister was referring to the February closure of the Holot detention centre in southern Israel .
The presence of migrants in Israel has become a key political issue , and Netanyahu is already under heavy pressure due to a string of graft probes .
He has repeatedly referred to them as `` not refugees but illegal infiltrators '' .
Some 200 migrants detained for refusing to leave Israel were released in mid-April following a Supreme Court ruling .
Israel 's highest judicial authority had ordered their release because of the government 's inability to conclude an agreement with third-party host countries .
Human rights groups have long condemned Israel for its immigration policy and treatment of Africans seeking asylum .
Most of the migrants arrived to Israel after 2007 , mainly from the Egypt 's Sinai Peninsula .
Security along the once porous border has since been signficantly tightened .
Many of them settled in a number of poor neighbourhoods in the coastal city of Tel Aviv , the country 's economic capital .
Amnesty International welcomed the cancellation , but voiced concern over the continued practise of `` voluntary '' expulsions .
`` Israel is still conducting what it calls 'voluntary ' deportations , though in reality there is nothing voluntary about them , '' the London-based rights watchdog said in a statement .
`` Israel remains under the obligation not to transfer anyone to a country where they would be at real risk of serious human rights violations , '' it added .
The UN has accused the Eritrea government of committing `` widespread and systematic '' crimes against humanity .
SINGAPORE : The Land Transport Authority ( LTA ) on Tuesday ( Aug 15 ) said it has called a tender to develop bus services based on commuters ' demand via a mobile application in real time , and trials will start in the second half of next year .
The agency said in a press release that this service would allow commuters to request pick-ups and drop-offs at any bus stop within an operating area , instead of relying on fixed timetables or routes . They would thus have customised bus services with possibly shorter waiting time .
The three areas identified as possible for the trial are Joo Koon ( for services 253 , 255 and 257 ) , Punggol North/West ( for services 84 and 382 ) and Shenton Way/ Marina South ( for services 400 and 402 ) . These services were identified due to their low demand during off-peak hours , and on-demand bus services could potentially better serve commuters , LTA explained .
Instead of being able to alight only at a bus stop along a fixed route , commuters would be able to ask to alight at any stop in the operating area , it added
Group director of Public Transport at LTA , Mr Yeo Teck Guan , said the tender will allow the authority to explore data analytics and mobile technology which have `` revolutionised the way that we travel , as we have seen in the success of ride-hailing '' .
The tender will have two phases : The first will be awarded by the fourth quarter of 2017 and the successful tenderer will conduct modelling and simulation to test service quality and resource requirements . The second phase , to be awarded in the second quarter of 2018 , will have public bus operators test and calibrate software and hardware solutions provided by the successful tenderer .

They will then trial the on-demand services in the second half of 2018 , it added .
Before the actual trial , LTA will work with bus operators and communities to ensure residents and commuters understand how to use the services . It will also continue to run the usual scheduled bus services , but at reduced frequency , to cater to those who are not able to adapt to the new service , it said .
Tender participants are also invited to submit proposals for on-demand , dynamically routed night bus services , to replace existing night bus services that have fixed timetables and routes , the agency added .
Canola growers are being advised to contact their grain buyer before using the herbicide quinclorac this growing season .
The Canola Council of Canada is welcoming the recent decision of the Codex Committee on Pesticide Residues to advance for adoption of the proposed Maximum Residue Limit for quinclorac in canola . However , an international MRL at Codex is not yet formally adopted . The Codex Alimentarius Commission is expected to officially adopt the report of the Codex Committee on Pesticide Residues at its July 2018 meeting .
“ For the canola industry , access to technology and stable trade are both high priorities , ” says Jim Everson , president of the Canola Council of Canada ( CCC ) . “ Ensuring that exported canola meets the requirements of our foreign markets , including with respect to pesticide residues , is of utmost importance to the value chain . We look forward to the formal adoption of the MRL this summer . ”
Processors and exporters continue to have concern about quinclorac-treated canola being accepted in China before the Codex Alimentarius Commission finalizes its process . Processors and exporters have indicated that until the report is formally adopted , they will not commit to accepting canola treated with quinclorac in 2018 .
Growers are advised to contact their grain buyer directly before using quinclorac in 2018 or to use other cleavers control methods .

BUFFALO , N.Y ( WIVB ) — Several women from Buffalo are coming together , for what they 're dubbing as the “ Get it done party ” filling bags with general hygiene items for ladies living in Puerto Rico .
The care packages include items like t-shirts , toothbrushes , shampoo , combs – all of which have been donated by community members and through partnerships with organizations like the GM plant in Tonawanda .
The organizers say the idea came about after seeing the footage of the devastation on the island after Hurricane Maria .
“ When a woman feels good about themselves it gives them the strength to just keep pushing , ” said Jennifer Parker , one of the organizers for the fundraiser . “ Those women are taking care of children , husbands , families . Women are naturally nurturers but who is taking care of them ? So the country is depending on the power of women and these bags , hopefully , give them a little energy and let them know someone is thinking of them and fighting for them to keep pushing . ”
You can head to the Power 96.5 studios in downtown Buffalo at 143 Broadway to drop off anything to be sent to Puerto Rico . They are collecting items through next week .
BLANTYRE- ( MaraviPost ) -The Malawi national netball team , the Queens , have breathed a sigh of relief after qualifying automatically for the 2019 Liverpool Netball World Cup , following latest International Netball Federation ( INF ) world rankings released on Sunday .
The Queens , who are ranked sixth in the world , have benefited from the fact that second-ranked England have qualified for the competition as hosts .
Following the development , five more teams have qualified automatically based on the rankings .
Malawi will therefore at the World Cup , join Australia ( number one ) , New Zealand ( third ) , Jamaica ( fourth ) and South Africa ( fifth ) .
The competition is equivalent to the Fifa World Cup finals .
Local netball expert , Chimwemwe Nyirenda told the Daily Times that the latest development means that results of Africa Netball Championship , which will take place in Lusaka , Zambia from August 13 to 19 , will not affect the Queens and South Africa 's participation at the World Cup .
“ This is because of their respective superior INF world rankings . However , other African countries will fight for qualification spots in Lusaka . The Queens gained more points at the last Commonwealth Games [ in Australia ] after beating New Zealand who were then the world 's number two team on INF rankings , ” he said .
Nyirenda said INF releases the list of qualified teams in advance for their planning and commercial reasons among others .
“ We ( Malawi ) have also qualified for the Fast5 Netball World Series which will take place in Australia in October . However , we need to avoid losing to teams that are ranked below us as this could affect our future rankings . But for now , we are safe , ” he said .
Netball Association of Malawi General Secretary , Carol Bapu , said they were relieved with the development but will not relax .
“ We still need to participate in international competitions so as to gain more points and move away from teams that are closing in on us on the rankings , ” she said .

HARRISBURG — Funding for a long-standing state grant program for private colleges and universities would be halved if lawmakers approve Gov . Tom Wolf 's proposed state budget .
The Pennsylvania Higher Education Assistance Agency has provided institutional assistance grants to nearly 90 higher education institutions that do not receive direct state aid for the past four decades . These grants are based on the number of PHEAA grant recipients enrolled at an institution . The grants help colleges and universities keep education costs down and help students with tuition on a need basis .
Wolf proposes to cut the available grant money from $ 25.7 million to $ 12.8 million next year . He would require recipient institutions to provide an as yet undefined matching grant for the state aid .
Wilkes University in Wilkes-Barre received a $ 586,000 grant in the current academic year , said President Patrick F. Leahy who acknowledged the budget pressures facing the governor and lawmakers .
“ Reducing this by 50 percent constitutes a small portion of the university 's overall budget , but , because the grants are based on the number of students we serve with financial need , we are sorry to lose any funding that helps us support those students , ” he said .
Keystone College in La Plume called the proposed cut a short-sighted approach .
“ At Keystone , ( institutional assistance grants ) are used to assist those students who face the greatest financial obstacles in funding their college education , ” said Keystone spokesman Fran Calpin . “ Therefore , reducing ( the grants ) not only impacts private college and universities but adversely affects the educational future of thousands of students in Northeastern Pennsylvania and throughout the state . ”
Colleges and universities underwrite tuition for students who are n't wealthy but are academic overachievers with these grants , said Rep. Mike Peifer , R-Greene Township . It 's an effective way of expanding access to education at private institutions , he said .
Peifer is in line to become chairman of PHEAA 's governing board later this month . PHEAA is a legislative-run agency . A cut in these grants would have a big economic impact on Northeastern Pennsylvania because of the considerable number of private colleges and universities there , Peifer said .
The grant program recognizes the large role that private institutions play in higher education in Pennsylvania , said Don Francis , president of the Association of Independent Colleges & Universities of Pennsylvania . They enroll 42 percent of the higher education students and award 49 percent all degrees , yet draw only 11 percent of state spending on higher education .
By tying an institution 's grant to the number of PHEAA grant recipients they serve , it steers state aid to low-income and moderate-income students , Francis said .
“ This makes the governor 's singling out the ( institutional assistance grant ) program as the only higher education programs for a cut most troubling , ” he said .

By Abu Nmodu , Minna
President Dangote Group , Aliko Dangote , yesterday disclosed that the company will invest 450 million dollars in agriculture development in Niger State over the next three years
Dangote who gave the hint at the 2017 Niger State Investment Summit in Minna , Niger State capital , said the funds will be used in establishing a large scale rice processing mill to process over 200 , 000 metric tonnes of paddy rice .
He said that a state-of-the-art fully integrated sugar refining industry would also be established .
His words : “ The Dangote Group is committed to invest around 450million dollars over the three next years to establish a large scale rice processing mill for out growers .

“ We are very excited about these investments and look forward to kick starting this mutually beneficial partnership with the government and good people of Niger State . ”
Dangote who was represented by Alhaji Mansur Ahmed noted that the company also planned to invest over one billion dollars in agricultural production and processing of selected commodities like sugar , rice and tomatoes across the country .
According to him , Niger has become the destination of choice for investment in the agricultural sector given its rich and vast arable land .
He said that the company was poised to leverage on that toward a virile agriculture based economy .
Dangote said that the group would also continue to engage governments at the federal and state levels where there were great potential to explore investment opportunities .
The Commissioner for Investment , Commerce and Industry , Mrs Ramatu Yardua said the aim of the summit was to market the state as an investment destination in agriculture considering its enormous potential which were largely untapped .
Yardua said that agriculture was key to moving the country out of recession , adding that the state was committed to creating a conducive and enabling environment for would be investors .
On his part , Acting President Yemi Osinbajo said that Niger has the capacity to produce assorted food crops that will feed the African continent .
Osinbajo said this when he declared open a two-day Niger State Economic Submit .
He commended the state governor , Gov . Abubakar Bello for organising the conference , noting that it would assist in attracting various investors , especially in the agricultural sector .
The acting president called on state governments to assist farmers with alternative sources of power , to enable them to process and preserve their farm produce .
He said that the federal government was ready to partner with state governments willing to rehabilitate federal infrastructure in their areas .
“ Niger State Government is collaborating with the Federal Government to complete Baro Port ” , the acting president said .
Osinbajo said that such projects would create enabling environment for business activities to thrive in the national economy .
He said that Niger was hosting three major hydro dams , adding that renewable energy was the way forward to increase the capacity of villagers and farmers for agricultural investment .
Osinbajo added that there was also the need to improve on roads infrastructure for enhanced agricultural development in the state .
Earlier , Governor Bello said that the state had large deposits of natural resources ranging from hydro carbon at the Bida Basin , gold , copper , tin , iron ore , tantalite , Kaoline and clay .
He said the potentials in the mining sector were wholly untapped and open for investment .

After two seasons of heartbreak , the Brantford Red Sox finally turned the tables on the Toronto Maple Leafs .
Playing in Game 7 on Sunday in Toronto during their opening round best-of-seven Intercounty Baseball League quarter-final playoff series , the Red Sox scored a come-from-behind 5-4 victory versus the Maple Leafs .
Brantford advanced to the best-of-seven semifinals and will face the first-place Barrie Baycats .
Game 1 will be Tuesday in Barrie at 7:30 p.m. , with Game 2 in Brantford at Arnold Anderson Stadium on Wednesday at 8 p.m .
Game 3 is in Barrie on Thursday at 7:30 p.m. and Game 4 is in Brantford on Sunday at 8 p.m .
If necessary , Game 5 is Aug. 22 in Barrie at 7:30 p.m. , Game 6 is Aug. 23 in Brantford at 8 p.m. and Game 7 is Aug. 24 in Barrie at 7:30 p.m .
For the past two seasons , Toronto has ended Brantford 's season in the IBL quarter-finals . This season , the Maple Leafs seemed poised to do that again but the Sox showed resilience .
Trailing Toronto 3-2 in the series , Brantford needed extra innings in Game 6 to tie the series and then some ninth-inning heroics in Game 7 to clinch the victory .
In Game 6 on Thursday at home , Brantford led the Leafs 10-7 going into the ninth inning . However , the Maple Leafs scored three times to even things before the Sox came back by scoring a single run in the 10th for an 11-10 victory .
That forced Game 7 on Sunday in Toronto , which saw a monumental comeback by Brantford to move on .
Down 4-1 with two outs to go in the game , Nick Burdett singled and then Dan Jagdeo homered to bring Brantford to within one .
After recording the second out of the ninth inning , the Maple Leafs were on their way to the win but Brandon Dailey had other ideas .
With Nate DeSouza on first after a single , Dailey homered to put Brantford up 5-4 .
Stefan Strecker then came in to shut the door as the Red Sox got their revenge .
Combined , the Sox and Baycats have won the last nine Intercounty Baseball League championships .
The last time these two teams met in the playoffs was back in 2014 , when Barrie ended Brantford 's run of six straight titles with a seven-game semifinal series win .
The Baycats defeated the Sox in all five head-to-head contests this season .
Barrie has not played since July 30 after receiving a first-round bye .
Iran protests
Mass - and mostly unexpected - protests across Iran marked the beginning of 2018 . IFEX members , including Human Rights Watch ( HRW ) , ARTICLE 19 , Global Voices , Reporters Without Borders ( RSF ) , and PEN International , reported and commented on several of the ramifications the widespread and largely leaderless demonstrations have had on freedom of expression .
In the early days of January , Human Rights Watch condemned the use of excessive force against demonstrators and demanded an investigation into the deaths of at least 21 individuals during clashes , and RSF exposed the Iranian regime 's efforts to target journalists and media outlets in Iran and censor coverage of protests by media based abroad . RSF and Global Voices also shed light on the central role Telegram , a messaging app popular in Iran , played in regards to the demonstrations , and its eventual blocking by authorities . PEN International highlighted the case of Iranian poet Mohammad Bamm , who was arrested by members of the Iranian security forces on 31 December 2017 while on his way home in the city of Abadan , Iran . And ARTICLE 19 identified the protest movement as an opportunity for the government to implement regulations intended to support government transparency , namely Iran 's Access to Information law .
Business as usual in the Gulf States
Despite promised reforms and plans for modernization , when journalists criticize the government in Saudi Arabia they are likely to get arrested . According to the Committee to Protect Journalists ( CPJ ) , in their first free expression-related arrest of 2018 , Saudi security forces arrested al-Shehi , a columnist for the Saudi Arabian daily al-Watan , on 3 January . On 25 January , the Specialized Criminal Court convicted two Saudi human rights activists solely for their human rights advocacy . According to HRW , Mohammad al-Oteibi was sentenced to 14 years in prison and Abdullah al-Attawi to 7 years .
It is not only journalists and critics inside Saudi Arabia who face reprisals for criticizing the country . In Kuwait , on 25 December 2017 , independent journalist Abdullah Al Saleh was sentenced in absentia to five years imprisonment with hard labour after being found guilty of `` abusing Saudi Arabia '' . Kuwaiti courts also found al-Saleh guilty of insulting the United Arab Emirates , and , in a separate trial , of insulting Bahrain , Saudi Arabia and the UAE collectively . According to CPJ , he has not been sentenced in these two cases yet . And on 3 January 2017 , human rights defender Sulaiman Bin Jassir , accused of allegedly storming Parliament and sentenced to seven years in prison , began a hunger strike to protest the injustice with which his trial was handled . According to the Gulf Center for Human Rights ( GCHR ) , Bin Jassir was sentenced based on `` fabricated charges '' and that he was targeted solely for his peaceful activism .
In Bahrain , on 15 January , the Court of Cassation rejected human rights defender Nabeel Rajab 's appeal of a two-year prison sentence for `` spreading fake news that undermine the prestige of the state '' , and postponed once again his case for tweeting against the Saudi-led coalition war in Yemen to February 21 , 2018 . The Bahrain Center for Human Rights ( BCHR ) and Americans for Democracy and Human Rights in Bahrain ( ADHRB ) published statements condemning the decision .
In Oman , on 15 January , a new and concerning Penal Code came into effect . According to a comprehensive analysis by GCHR , `` the new law contains several vaguely-defined articles that could easily be used by the Internal Security Service ( ISS ) , known for its history of human rights violations , to target human rights defenders and internet activists , and to suffocate public freedoms '' .
War on Yemen
Journalists and activists in Yemen operate under dangerous circumstances . Given that international journalists have very little access to the country , the courageous efforts of local activists and reporters to inform the international community of the suffering Yemenis have been subjected to by all sides of the conflict are gravely needed , but they come at an incredibly high price .
On 22 January , Yemeni photographer Mohammad Al Qadisi was killed in a missile strike while on assignment . A second journalist , reporter Basheer Aqlan , was injured in the same attack and is in a coma at Khalifa Hospital with shrapnel injuries to his head and neck , according to CPJ .
Journalists and activists are also often targeted specifically for their activities . Both the Houthis and the Saudi-led coalition have forcibly disappeared thousands of Yemenis . After five months in captivity , Houthis released prominent activist and political analyst Hisham Al-Omeisy this month . Both Global Voices and GHCR celebrated his release and called on all warring parties to release all those detained for their peaceful activities .
Tunisia marks seven years since revolution with crackdown on dissent
A ten-day wave of anti-austerity protests in various Tunisian cities this January have been marred by police mistreatment and harassment of protesters and journalists alike . According to HRW , police sometimes beat those arrested and denied their right to a lawyer under Tunisian law . They also arrested some people for distributing leaflets critical of the government . One French reporter was briefly taken to a police station and interrogated for nearly an hour on 11 January and another was questioned on 14 January . One reporter had his phone confiscated . Also in January , a Tunisian blogger who recently won election to parliament discovered he is facing two military trials for criticizing the army on social media .
Egypt 's vanishing space for political expression
As Egypt 's first presidential election since Abdel Fattah El Sisi took power approaches , both international and local observers have noted Sisi 's attempts at eliminating any serious opposition to his rule . Regional organisations , including the Cairo Institute for Human Rights Studies ( CIHRS ) and the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information , warned in December 2017 that the upcoming elections would simply be `` a referendum to renew fealty to the sitting president '' , and the arrest and enforced disappearance of potential presidential candidate General Sami Anan on 20 January confirmed it . In a joint statement condemning the arrest , CIHRS , ANHRI , and other local organizations listed several other examples of government attempts at discouraging potential presidential opponents .
Furthermore , on 27 January , Judge Hisham Genena ( Anan 's human rights affairs deputy ) was brazenly attacked in what appears to be the latest reprisal in a coordinated retaliatory campaign by Egypt 's security forces against anyone willing to challenge Sisi 's claim to the presidency .
Lebanon 's shrinking tolerance for critical speech
A pattern of prosecutions against those who criticise officials that began in November 2017 in Lebanon continued well into January 2018 , with three new cases bringing criminal charges against Lebanese citizens . Human Rights Watch released a statement on 31 January expressing concern and providing details of each individual case .
Lebanon also came under fire internationally this month after researchers at the Electronic Frontier Foundation ( EFF ) and Lookout released a report alleging that a malware espionage campaign responsible for stealing hundreds of gigabytes worth of personal data was tied to a building owned by Lebanon 's General Security agency . Ten human rights and media organisations called on Lebanon 's general prosecutor to investigate the claims of secret large-scale surveillance .

Officers at the Marigot Police Station have said the station is in a terrible condition after Hurricane Maria and they feel abandoned by the Police High Command .
The roof of the building where the station is housed was blown away by the storm and officers say since then no repairs have been made .
Police sources at the station told DNO that after the storm they were visited by Deputy Police Chief Davidson Valerie and Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of National Security Jo-Anne Commodore but nothing has been done .
The officers say water from the roof is a major problem whenever it rains .
Added to that that the station is infested with mold and mosquitos .
One officer has fallen sick twice because of the conditions and others have been complaining of severe coughs .
Other institutions operating in the building , such as the Treasury Department and Magistrate 's Court , have been relocated but the police station remains .
“ The situation is bad , we feel abandoned , ” one officer told DNO .
DNO was told that other police stations on the east coast that received damage during Maria have been repaired , while the Marigot Police Station remains untouched .
The officers are now calling on Police Chief Daniel to visit the station to witness the conditions himself .
Congress president Rahul Gandhi has targeted the ambitious bullet train project of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and said that it is a “ magic train which might never be seen in reality. ” Rahul , on his two-day visit to Amethi , attacked PM Modi , BJP and RSS . “ Today there are three major challenges in front of India , unemployment , inflation and condition of farmers . If unemployment ends , inflation will be reduced . India is the third most powerful emerging power after the USA and China and we want India to shine on the international front , ” he said.The Congress chief accused the central government of ignoring the interests of the farmers and working for the benefit of industrialists. “ What is PM Modi , RSS and BJP doing today ? PM Modi has given the maximum money of the country in the hands of five to ten industrialists , while small entrepreneurs are being ignored . Last year PM Modi waved off zero rupees of our farmers but he waved off Rs 2 lakh crore of 15 people . The money collected after GST and demonetisation was given away to Nirav Modi and Vijay Mallya . The farmers of the country have been finished by PM Modi , ” Rahul added.Rahul said the bullet train project will be completed during Congress regime . “ PM Modi shared swing with Chinese President in Gujarat , where bullet train project was announced . But that bullet train is actually a magic train which might never be seen in reality . PM Modi obliged China , but on the other hand Chinese forces intruded in Doklam . Our PM remained silent on the issue of Doklam and did not utter a word against China. ” The Amethi MP also said that if a RSS person sees a Hindu , he also notices his caste , but the Congress party talks about connecting everyone.After addressing a gathering in Fursatganj , Rahul went to visit the family of the deceased farmer Abdul Sattar in Dhingai village in Jayas area . Sattar died allegedly after waiting for two days to sell his produce at a local government crop purchase centre.While the victim 's brother alleged that Sattar died of a heart attack , as he was worried overselling his the produce , the authorities maintained that the cause of the death could not be confirmed in the postmortem report .
The manner in which three petitions challenging the credibility of EVMs were wrapped up by the Supreme Court last week has left lawyers befuddled.On August 9 , a three-judge bench , led by Chief Justice of India JS Khehar , took up as many as four such petitions and the status of all the cases later showed as 'disposed of ' on the court 's website.But lawyers in two of these cases told CNN-News18 that they had no idea that their cases were being heard on that day and what orders were passed to dispose them of subsequently.Of the four cases , the first was a plea confined to conducting Assembly polls in Gujarat using EVMs with VVPAT ( paper trail ) machines.The other three petitions included PILs filed separately by ML Sharma , Ata-ur Rahman and the Bahujan Samaj Party ( BSP ) .These three petitions were listed last on August 4 when the court adjourned them for two weeks.The bench had given PIL petitioners the liberty to file their written replies to the stand taken by the Election Commission and Law Ministry in their affidavits.The court order dated August 4 had stated : `` Learned counsel for the petitioner ( s ) seeks an adjournment , so as to enable them to file rejoinder affidavit . Prayer is allowed . Rejoinder affidavit be positively filed within two weeks from today . Post for hearing thereafter . `` But these cases got listed again four days later.On August 9 , these three petitions were taken up along with another petition , which had sought direction to the EC for conducting upcoming polls in Gujarat using VVPAT ( voter verifiable paper audit trail ) .When the matter came up on the morning of August 9 before the bench , which also comprised Justices Adarsh K Goel and DY Chandrachud , the Election Commission submitted it had enough VVPAT machines for Gujarat assembly polls and that the first petition could , hence , be disposed of.Lawyers in the other cases , however , pointed out that their cases had come up abruptly after being adjourned for two weeks.But the bench was not satisfied with the submissions made by the counsel for the BSP and cautioned him against wasting the time of the court.It then deferred the hearing for a day later , to August 10.However , what happened in the next few hours remains a mystery for some of the lawyers in these cases . `` We got back knowing our cases had been adjourned till the next day . But suddenly , I started getting calls from other lawyers and media personnel asking if our petition had been disposed of , '' said a lawyer , who did not wish to be named.Another lawyer told CNN-News18 that he had left for Mumbai to undergo a therapy after his PIL was adjourned for two weeks on August 4 . `` When we asked others , we were told some BSP lawyer mentioned the case on August 9 at 3.30pm and the bench disposed of all the four cases by a common order . But five days on , even the order has been not released , '' rued one of the lawyers.They were also of the opinion that if the court had to close all the cases based on affidavits filed by the EC and the Law Ministry , it could have been done even on August 4 . `` The bench had still given to us two weeks on that day to counter the stand taken by EC and the Centre , and substantiate our cases against use of EVMs . We are perplexed if the cases have been disposed of . We may have to file a review petition once the court releases its order , '' said the lawyer .
Shares in household and personal care products supplier McBride slumped up to 18 % this morning after the company said full-year 2017/18 adjusted pre-tax profits would be “ marginally below the lower end of analyst expectations ” . The trouble is that “ marginally below ” is still worse than even the most pessimistic of number crunchers . And traders do n't like profits warnings , especially so late in the day , and has already issued one in January .
France is highlighted as registering continued revenue declines since half-year results in Feb , albeit balanced by growth in Germany . Personal Care & Aerosols is expected to post marginally higher losses than expected due to weak revenues .
Today 's admission comes after weaker than expected sales in May and June , despite increasing volumes in the final quarter . Matters were made worse by higher distribution/warehousing costs and inefficiencies . Disappointing sales on higher volumes with higher costs : not a good recipe for profitability .
June may have shown some sales improvement , but clearly , nowhere near enough to make up for May . And June was obviously still weak itself . The aggregate clearly made for an extremely disappointing close to the year , so much so that it nullified Feb 's full-year guidance ( “ adj . PBT and adj . EPS broadly in-line with last year ” ) . Either that or the company was already sailing too close to the wind at the halfway stage and was hoping for the best .
Only a couple of days into July , the risk is that the weakness that leads to today 's warning persists , making for a weak start to the new financial year . This is likely what hurt the shares most today : reduced expectations have a knock on for financial forecasts and thus valuations .
The company clearly waited until the very end of the period to see whether profits might sneak in at the lower end of guidance . It was n't to be . Results on 6 September will offer much more detail and of course fresh guidance on 2018/19 which could impact valuations and the share price again .
With the shares well off their worst levels though , investors ( and bargain hunters ) are clearly hoping that the improvement in June persists into July and August , that the company 's downbeat assessment and share price are both over-reactions , and that things are brighter going forward . Work to do though with the shares -46.1 % YTD from December 's best in nearly 8 years .
Bo Horvat believes it 's show-time for himself and the Canucks who have some NHL experience : “ There are no excuses . I 've had my time in the league . I 've played three full years and I ca n't play the young-guy card . I have to bring it every night . ''
There is an oft-repeated story in NHL lore concerning the wide-eyed rookie facing off against the veteran star and Ben Hutton admits his younger self was struck by hero worship on a number of occasions .
“ I 'd line up and I was like , ‘ Holy crap . That 's Ryan Getzlaf beside me , ' ” said the Canucks ' third-year defenceman . “ Or that 's Corey Perry coming down on me . I guess a lot of guys go through that . ”
Maybe , but one day those same guys look up at the player bearing down on them and do n't see Perry or Jeff Carter or whoever . They see No . 10 for the Anaheim Ducks and , at that moment , they 're no longer a kid finding his way in the world 's toughest league but a full-blown NHLer judged by the game 's highest standard .
Hutton has now arrived at that point in his career . As it happens , so has Bo Horvat , Sven Baertschi , Markus Granlund , Troy Stecher , Erik Gudbranson and even the goaltending tandem of Jacob Markstrom and Anders Nilsson . All are 25 and under — OK the goalies are both 27 but that 's under 25 in real years — and all have demonstrated some promise to date .
But promise is no longer good enough for the Canucks . Any hope they have of extricating themselves from the pit in which they dug themselves rests on those players taking a collective step in the next phase of their careers .
It might be asking a lot but , if it does n't happen for that group of players this year , it might never happen for this team . If that 's the case , a lot of people in this province will be saying , ‘ Holy crap , ' and not in the good way .
“ There are no excuses , ” said Horvat on Friday as the Canucks prepared for Saturday 's season-opener against Edmonton . “ I 've had my time in the league . I 've played three full years and I ca n't play the young-guy card . I have to bring it every night .
“ I 'm going to be playing against the best players in the world night-in , night-out and I 've got to be ready for that . ”
In other words he 's become a man and it 's time to set aside his childish ways .
“ Making the playoffs is our goal in here , ” said Henrik Sedin . “ There 's no question about it . But you want to see young guys take another step . If they do , we have a chance to make the playoffs . ”
In the Canucks ' final tune-up for Game 1 of the NHL 's 82-game marathon , most of the outside focus was on the lamentable decision to sit Jake Virtanen against the Oilers in favour of a more veteran lineup .
It appears the Canucks are still struggling with their messaging but this is just the first game of the season and there will be plenty of time to hammer away at Travis Green 's decisions .
The story of the Canucks ' millennials , meanwhile , might not be as sexy but its infinitely more important to the team 's aspirations in 2017-18 . The 25-and-under crowd represents one-third of the Canucks ' lineup and their greatest hope for advancement .
Horvat is entering his fourth year which is typically a breakout season . Can he make the jump from 50-point complementary centre to 75-point alpha male ?
Granlund and Baertschi are coming off 19- and 18-goal seasons , respectively . Can they get to the 25-goal mark and help transform the Canucks ' pop-gun offence ?
Gudbranson , with 339 career NHL games , is the most experienced player in the group but he 's still only 25 . He 's also coming off an injury-plagued season and his return to form is crucial for a team that has to improve its penalty kill .
Stecher is coming off a commendable rookie season but can he be the power-play quarterback this team has desperately needed ? What about Hutton ? While we 're asking questions , can those two provide some offence on a blue-line that totalled a pitiful 22 goals last season ?
As for the goalies , they 're a little farther along . But Markstrom , who figures to shoulder most of the workload , has never played more than 32 games in a season and Nilsson 's highest total is 26 games .
Add it all up and it 's unlikely this group will take the necessary leap forward together . But what if Markstrom establishes himself as a bona fide No . 1 this season ? What if Gudbranson keys an improved penalty kill and Hutton and Stecher combine for 15 goals ? What if Horvat supplants Henrik as the team 's first-line centre ?
It likely wo n't be enough to get the Canucks into the playoffs but it will send the right message about this team 's future . That might be as much as the Canucks could hope for out of this season .
“ There usually comes a time when you know what you have in a player , ” said Green . “ You know what to expect , what their plateau is , what their great games are .
“ We still do n't know that with some of our guys . ”
Which might not be the most comforting feeling for a first-year head coach but it should guarantee things wo n't be boring around his team this season .
“ We 're not rookies anymore , ” said Hutton . “ I 'd like to think we 've established a name for ourselves . I do n't think it 's ‘ who 's that Baertschi guy ' anymore or ‘ who 's that Horvat ? ' ”
No , but would n't it be great if that turned into , ‘ Damn , who 's that Horvat ? '

Hundreds fewer people are dying from bowel cancer compared with 20 years ago , new analysis suggests .
Cancer Research UK said that better treatments are behind the reduction in the rate of people who die from the disease .
Improved public awareness and the bowel screening programme may also be playing a part , the charity said .
New figures from the charity show that b owel cancer was responsible for 38 deaths per 100,000 people in 1995 , falling to 26 deaths per 100,000 people by 2015 .
The charity said that the reduction equates to a decrease in bowel cancer deaths from 17,600 in 1995 to 15,800 in 2015
Professor Matt Seymour , Cancer Research UK 's bowel cancer expert based at the University of Leeds , said : `` Early diagnosis is critical for bowel cancer survival .
`` In my opinion , GPs and patients are becoming more aware of bowel cancer symptoms and acting more quickly than in the past .
`` The national screening programme , introduced in 2006 , means some cancers can be cured before they have caused any symptoms at all .
`` And in our hospitals , better standards of surgery , radiotherapy , chemotherapy , imaging and pathology are all improving patients ' chance of cure . ''
The b owel cancer screening test sees all men and women aged 60 to 74 sent a home test kit in the post every two years .
In 2014 , around 41,300 people were diagnosed with bowel cancer .
And in 2015 , the disease claimed the lives of 8,613 men and 7,152 women .
Symptoms of the condition include : persistent blood in stools , a persistent change in bowel habit and lower abdominal pain , bloating or discomfort .
Cancer Research UK said people can reduce their risk of the disease by cutting down on red and processed meat , keeping a healthy weight , not smoking and keeping active .
Dr Julie Sharp , head of health information at the charity , added : `` The increasing number of people surviving bowel cancer today shows how vital research has improved the treatment of the disease over the years .
`` This positive trend is set to continue as new and improved bowel screening is rolled out nationwide which can detect the early signs of cancer before symptoms develop . Together all these improvements will continue to have a real impact on tackling this disease . ''

Someone asked me what my problem with Steve Bannon , assistant to the US president and Chief Strategist in the Trump administration , was ...
I have no problem with him . But forgetting [ injustice and hate of others ] for me is not an option . I will not remain silent ; when we are silent even God does n't help us . Speak up when you see evil intent .
I speak because I see in the eyes the glee of hate , the drab attire the cold-bloodedness of a persona who 'coldly and deliberately participated in and ordered the massacres of all those doctors of law or medicine or theology , all those lovers of art and poetry , of Bach and Goethe . '
Bannon is the kind of mindset that finally reveals itself as extreme executor . He has a huge influence over a man who has at his fingertips the deadliest nuclear armoury of the entire planet . Will you not be worried ?
This is one of the most powerful Nobel lectures delivered by Nobelist Elie Wiesel on December 11 , 1986 . Please read it so that you understand :
Hope , Despair and Memory
And the question of questions : Where was God in all this ? '' Where was God in all this ? '' and 'Why bring children into a world in which God and man betrayed their trust in one another ? 'How could we ever understand the passivity of the onlookers and - yes - the silence of the Allies ?
It seemed as impossible to conceive of Auschwitz with God as to conceive of Auschwitz without God . Therefore , everything had to be reassessed because everything had changed . With one stroke , mankind 's achievements seemed to have been erased . 'Was Auschwitz a consequence or an aberration of `` civilisation '' ? All we know is that Auschwitz called that civilisation into question as it called into question everything that had preceded Auschwitz . Scientific abstraction , social and economic contention , nationalism , xenophobia , religious fanaticism , racism , mass hysteria . All found their ultimate expression in Auschwitz .
The next question had to be , why go on ? If memory continually brought us back to this , why build a home ? Why bring children into a world in which God and man betrayed their trust in one another ?
Of course , we could try to forget the past . Why not ? Is it not natural for a human being to repress what causes him pain , what causes him shame ? Like the body , memory protects its wounds . When day breaks after a sleepless night , one 's ghosts must withdraw ; the dead are ordered back to their graves . But for the first time in history , we could not bury our dead . We bear their graves within ourselves .
For us , forgetting was never an option . The great historian Shimon Dubnov served as our guide and inspiration . Until the moment of his death he said over and over again to his companions in the Riga ghetto : `` Yidden , shreibt un fershreibt '' ( Jews , write it all down ) . His words were heeded . Overnight , countless victims become chroniclers and historians in the ghettos , even in the death camps . Even members of the Sonderkommandos , those inmates forced to burn their fellow inmates ' corpses before being burned in turn , left behind extraordinary documents . To testify became an obsession . They left us poems and letters , diaries and fragments of novels , some known throughout the world , others still unpublished .
Consuming energy drinks could be a gateway to cocaine use , a new study suggests .
According to researchers at the University of Maryland 's School of Public Health , young adults who said they consumed energy drinks between the ages of 21 and 24 were at a greater risk of doing cocaine or prescription stimulants for non-medical uses .
The study recruited 1,099 participants when they were 18-year-old college students .
More than half of the participants fell into the group with a `` persistent trajectory '' - meaning they continued to consume energy drinks over time . Members of this group were `` significantly '' more likely to use stimulant drugs .
`` This study gives evidence of a specific contribution of energy drink consumption to later substance use , '' said Professor Amelia Arria , an associate professor of behavioural and community health who was the lead author on the study . `` The results suggest that energy drink users might be at heightened risk for other substance use , particularly stimulants . ''
Even those who occasionally consumed energy drinks were at an increased risk of stimulant drug use .
Those who did n't consume energy drinks as they got older were less likely to develop substance-abuse issues .
While the study does n't explain why consuming energy drinks may be linked to stimulant drug use , researchers say it should be investigated further .
Shares of Google parent Alphabet Inc lost almost 5 percent on Tuesday as a surge in costs drove what analysts said was its biggest ever contraction in gross margins , overshadowing strong first-quarter ad sales .
REUTERS : Shares of Google parent Alphabet Inc lost almost 5 percent on Tuesday as a surge in costs drove what analysts said was its biggest ever contraction in gross margins , overshadowing strong first-quarter ad sales .
The dive in first-quarter operating margins , to 22 percent from 27 percent a year ago , follows a troubling six weeks for major U.S. tech players , now facing a more questioning public and the prospect of tighter official scrutiny on privacy issues .
The fall in Alphabet shares following its first quarter results on Monday evening turned them negative for the year and amounted to a roughly US $ 37 billion reduction in the value of the Mountain View , California-based firm .
At least 8 brokerages cut their price targets on the shares , compared to four who raised .
But analysts were reluctant to place the blame as yet on the row over user data which has engulfed Facebook and threatens to encourage more regulation of internet companies .
`` There is regulatory risk , though we have yet to find evidence that regulations will adversely impact the usefulness of Google for consumers or advertisers , '' RBC analysts said .

Longer-term capital expenditures at Google nearly tripled to US $ 7.3 billion in the first quarter from US $ 2.5 billion a year ago .
The company said that continuing cost increases came from acquiring streaming rights for YouTube 's new TV service and marketing new products .
Google executives say the spending to install powerful computers and internet cables is necessary to keep up with demand for YouTube , its Google Assistant virtual helper service and data analytics tools within its Google Cloud services .
`` With YouTube 's rapid growth ( also in non-ad-supported services ) and a greater emphasis on hardware made by Google , we think this gross margin contraction will continue , '' Cannacord Genuity analyst Michael Graham wrote in a client note .

`` Gross margin contracted ~370 bps y/y , ( that is ) the largest contraction in company history . ''
Ad sales also suggested that there were no immediate signs of the privacy concerns affecting profits .
Shares of the company have risen 25 percent in the past year , making it the third best performing of the FAANG group of tech stocks , trailing only Amazon and Netflix .

Moscow on Friday faced over 130 fake bomb calls that prompted the evacuation of some 100,000 people from shopping malls , schools , railway stations and office buildings.It was the most massive flurry of fake bomb threats since a wave of bomb hoaxes began in early September . The fake bomb threats have affected dozens of Russian cities and incurred massive economic damages.Among those targeted by the bomb calls Friday were all four Moscow airports , five railway stations , 15 shopping malls , several hotels , more than 20 schools and many other venues , the state Tass news agency said . No explosives have been found in the anonymous calls.Flights to and from Moscow were n't affected , as security agents at the airports checked for explosives without holding evacuations.The bomb calls continued until the evening , when the Luzhniki sports arena and office buildings in the Moscow City district were evacuated including the Moscow city hall legislature and the government 's analytical center.Alexander Bortnikov , the director of the Federal Security Service ( FSB ) , the main KGB successor , said the agency had tracked down four people suspected of engineering the wave of hoaxes.Bortnikov said the suspects were Russians living abroad who had accomplices inside the country , but he would n't identify them or describe their motives . He added that the perpetrators were using internet connections to make the calls , making them hard to identify.Russian media have speculated that the fake calls might have been launched from neighbouring Ukraine which has been angered by Moscow 's 2014 annexation of Crimea and it supports for pro-Russia separatist rebels in eastern Ukraine or staged by other Kremlin foes .
ANCHORAGE , Alaska ( AP )  The search has been called off for the six veteran fishermen aboard a crabbing boat missing in the icy , turbulent Bering Sea .
The fishing vessel Destination went missing early Saturday after an emergency signal from a radio beacon registered to the ship . The signal originated from 2 miles off St. George , an island about 650 miles west of Kodiak Island .
The Coast Guard released a statement Monday night saying the search has been suspended .
`` We extend our deepest condolences to the family and friends of the six crewmembers during this extremely difficult time , '' said Rear Adm. Michael McAllister , commander of the Coast Guard 17th District . `` The decision to suspend a search is always difficult and is made with great care and consideration . ''

Out of respect for the families , the owners of the vessel were not releasing names of crewmen , who are all experienced , professional fishermen , said spokesman Mike Barcott in an email from Seattle .
`` This is a terrible tragedy for them and the fishing community , '' Barcott said . `` Our hearts are broken for their loved ones who are now left with the certainty of this tragic sinking . ''
The search began after the Coast Guard received the signal from the Destination 's emergency beacon . The device can by activated manually or automatically when it hits seawater .
Searchers found the device in a debris field along with an oil slick , life ring and buoys .
A C-130 transport plane joined the Coast Guard cutter Morgenthau in the search for the 98-foot vessel . Upon arrival , the crew of the plane reported 30 mph winds , 5- to 8-foot waves and an air temperature of 20 degrees .
The Coast Guard received no mayday call indicating a problem with the vessel , Petty Officer 3rd Class Lauren Steenson said .
Bad weather is the main hazard for Bering Sea fishing vessels at this time of year , said Lt. Brenden Kelley , operations officer and navigator on the Kodiak-based Monroe , a sister vessel to the Morgenthau .
Boat captains with computer connectivity have far more tools than in the past for watching the weather and can take steps to avoid or mitigate its danger , he said .
The primary factor is the direction of the wind and distance it travels , or fetch , which determines wave height and frequency , he said .
There are not many places to find shelter in the Bering Sea , but the leeward sides of St. George and St. Paul islands are two important options , Kelley said .
`` When the wind gets blocked by an island , or a barrier , man-made or otherwise , it really helps to push down some of the seas and make it a little better and safer for the vessels , '' he said .
Seawater freezes at 26 to 28 degrees , he said , and ice can build up on a boat . In open ocean , boats will vary their course so that sea spray hits both sides of the vessel . Crews use baseball bats or rubber mallets to remove ice because too much weight decreases buoyancy and could make a boat flip .
Barcott says the owners will work with the Coast Guard to learn what they can to help prevent such an event from happening again .
Few LGBT people thought Donald Trump would be a friend to the community if elected president . The New York Times editorial board looked at the early record and debunked the idea .
They point out a number of appointments of officials to top positions who are openly hostile to the LGBT equality . Human Rights Campaign highlighted some of the top points :
• Among his first actions , AG Jeff Sessions revoked the Obama Administration 's guidance protecting the dignity and safety of transgender students ;
• Tom Price , an anti-LGBTQ politician picked by Trump to head the Department of Health and Human Services , which under Obama expanded access to healthcare for LGBTQ people , has been joined by Roger Severino , equally hostile to LGBTQ equality , to run the Department 's Office of Civil Rights ; ;
• Trump has nominated aggressively anti-LGBTQ Tennessee legislator Mark Green to head the U.S. Army , most recently led by Eric Fanning — the first openly gay leader of a branch of the U.S. military .
• Under Trump , federal agencies , including HHS , are rolling back efforts to collect data on the LGBTQ communities .
In addition , on Friday , ( April 14 ) , Trump nominated former New Jersey Rep. Scott Garrett to become president of the Export-Import Bank . Garrett refused to contribute to the House Republicans fundraising campaign because he said it supported gay candidates .

`` The Failing @ nytimes quotes ‘ a senior White House official , ' who does n't exist , as saying ‘ even if the meeting were reinstated , holding it on June 12 would be impossible , given the lack of time and the amount of planning needed . ' WRONG AGAIN ! Use real people , not phony sources . ''
Most Americans are n't glued to Twitter over the Memorial Day weekend , but that did n't stop a controversy this year , pitting President Donald Trump against journalists who cover the White House .
On May 25 , the New York Times published an article headlined , `` Trump Says North Korea Summit May Be Rescheduled . '' The article included a line expressing an unnamed White House official 's skepticism that a summit between Trump and Kim Jong-un could be held on its originally scheduled date .
`` On Thursday , for example , a senior White House official told reporters that even if the meeting were reinstated , holding it on June 12 would be impossible , given the lack of time and the amount of planning needed , '' the article said .
The following morning , Trump tweeted criticism of the New York Times story .
`` The Failing @ nytimes quotes ‘ a senior White House official , ' who does n't exist , as saying ‘ even if the meeting were reinstated , holding it on June 12 would be impossible , given the lack of time and the amount of planning needed , ' '' Trump tweeted . `` WRONG AGAIN ! Use real people , not phony sources . ''
The Failing @ nytimes quotes “ a senior White House official , ” who does n't exist , as saying “ even if the meeting were reinstated , holding it on June 12 would be impossible , given the lack of time and the amount of planning needed. ” WRONG AGAIN ! Use real people , not phony sources . — Donald J. Trump ( @ realDonaldTrump ) May 26 , 2018
Reporters from multiple outlets began pushing back on the notion that the New York Times had fabricated a source . The White House , they said , had actually furnished the source that Trump denied existing .
They said the official did indeed exist ; in fact , he had conducted `` an off-camera , not for broadcast , background briefing on North Korea , '' in the wording of the White House email that had announced it on May 24 .
The briefing had been held in the White House press room and was opened up to reporters elsewhere via a conference call line . Under the ground rules of a `` background briefing , '' reporters can not use the name of the specific official and instead must use a more vague descriptor .
The New York Times published a story after Trump sent his tweet , headlined , `` Trump Falsely Says Times Made Up Source in Report on Korea Summit Meeting . '' It said that the source referred to in the article `` was in fact a senior White House official speaking to a large group of reporters in the White House briefing room . ''
Margaret Talev , the president of the White House Correspondents ' Association , tweeted that she shared her `` colleagues ' conclusion . ''
I share my colleagues ' conclusion- the sr official whose existence the president disputes certainly appears to be same sr official who briefed 100+ of us in person and via conf call from WH . Brfng conducted on condition it is on bck with no audio/video distrib . — Margaret Talev ( @ margarettalev ) May 26 , 2018
So what 's going on here ? We did our own review . We found Trump was wrong in saying that the source `` does n't exist '' and was `` phony . '' Evidence shows Trump 's own White House arranged the briefing with the official .
Did the source exist ?
Yes . This can be demonstrated by audio released on Twitter by Yashar Ali , a contributor to New York magazine and HuffPost . The clip offers the first minute and a half of the background briefing . ( The audio is actually video of the press room 's empty lectern as it is records sound elsewhere in the room . )
4 . I 've obtained audio of the WH press briefing . You can hear Raj Shah , Deputy Press Secretary , introduce Pottinger ( along with the terms - which are standard ) and then Pottinger makes the statement that POTUS says was never made . Lots of reporters in briefing room and on phone . pic.twitter.com/2gEYkRSyTv — Yashar Ali 🐘 ( @ yashar ) May 26 , 2018
Some media outlets have not published the briefer 's name , including many outlets who participated in the briefing and felt they were bound by the original agreement not to publish the name . However , other outlets have subsequently published the name made available in the audio Ali tweeted .
PolitiFact will reprint the briefer 's name for a few reasons : It is needed to full address the accuracy of Trump 's charge ; the information is now readily available on the Internet ; and we were not a participant in the original briefing and did not agree to keep it on background .
The briefer was Matthew Pottinger , the National Security Council 's senior director for Asian affairs .
Here 's a transcript of the audio segment Ali tweeted :
White House press official : `` This briefing 's going to be on background , off camera , not for broadcast . Pottinger here can be referred to as a senior White House official . He is deputy assistant to the president for Asia . And you can take it from here . ''
Reporter : `` Can you clarify that the president obviously announced in the letter that the particular time and date of the summit is called off . Later , he said it 's possible the existing summit could take place , or a summit at a later date . Is he saying it 's possible that June 12 could still happen ? ''
Pottinger : `` The main point , I suppose , is that the ball 's in North Korea 's court right now . And there 's really not a lot of time . We 've lost quite a bit of time that we would need in order to — I mean there 's an enormous amount of preparation that 's gone on over the past few months in the White House , at State , and with other agencies and so forth , but there 's a certain amount of actual dialogue that needs to take place at the working level with your counterparts to ensure that the agenda is clear in the minds of those two leaders when they sit down to actually meet and talk and negotiate and hopefully make a deal . And June 12 is in 10 minutes and it 's going to be , you know — but the president has said that he some day looks forward to meeting… ''
The White House declined to either confirm or deny to PolitiFact that Pottinger was the briefer . But the audio speaks for itself .
Why Trump questioned the New York Times report
Trump 's underlying issue with the New York Times report might have to do with its paraphrase of what the official said .
Pottinger was certainly skeptical that a summit could happen on the original date , but he never actually used the word `` impossible '' — which is the phrasing the New York Times ' article had used .
The White House argues that Trump 's incredulity is justified because , despite the New York Times ' characterization , nobody said in the briefing that a summit would be `` impossible . ''
That said , the New York Times paraphrased Pottinger rather than quoting him , as Trump said in his tweet . That gives the newspaper a bit of wiggle room .
Our ruling
Trump tweeted , `` The Failing @ nytimes quotes ‘ a senior White House official , ' who does n't exist , as saying ‘ even if the meeting were reinstated , holding it on June 12 would be impossible , given the lack of time and the amount of planning needed . ' WRONG AGAIN ! Use real people , not phony sources . ''
Trump is wrong that the senior White House official cited by the New York Times `` does n't exist '' and is `` phony . '' In fact , the official in question , Pottinger , gave an authorized background briefing to dozens of reporters in person and via phone .
The New York Times article that Trump criticized may have gone too far by paraphrasing Pottinger as saying that a June 12 summit would be impossible , since Pottinger did n't use that specific word . However , Pottinger did express a significant degree of skepticism about the prospect of a June 12 summit .
If that was Trump 's gripe , it is n't what he said . The White House source did exist . We rate Trump 's statement Pants on Fire .
“ Riverdale ” star Lili Reinhart is speaking out after social media critics say she 's too thin to have body issues .
“ Feeling really disheartened by the fact that so many people are saying ‘ you 're skinny so shut up about embrscing [ sic ] your body , ' ” she tweeted on Wednesday morning . “ As if my body dysmorphia is irrelevant because of how I look to some people . I 'm either not curvy enough or not skinny enough to feel insecure . ”
Reinhart , who 's spoken out about her battle with depression and anxiety , added , “ Mental illness gets worse when people say that you do n't have a right to feel the way you do . That 's where we are dailing [ sic ] . Do not encourage this behavior . It is destructive . More destructive than you 'll ever realize . You may not understand someone 's insecurity- but respect it . ”
The comments stemmed from a recent article in Harper 's Bazaar in which the 21-year-old actress said she was inspired by Marilyn Monroe 's curvy figure because it made her feel like her body would be accepted .
After a Twitter user criticized her , she snapped back , “ Telling someone they do n't deserve to feel insecure because their body is ‘ fine ' or ‘ just like ' whomever .. is wrong . That 's part of the problem . That 's part of body-shaming . ”
“ I will never understand how someone can be so cowardly as to hide behind their phone and tell a stranger that their feelings are irrelevant and considered ‘ whining , ' just because they think you represent some ideal figure or shape , ” she added in another tweet .
Ducks defenseman Cam Fowler skated Monday for the first time since April 4 , when he took a knee-on-knee hit from Calgary defenseman Mark Giordano and was knocked out of the lineup .
Fowler , the Ducks ' regular-season minutes leader and the linchpin of their defense , declined to comment when asked if he thought the hit was deliberate and said he 's progressing well in a recovery that was projected to take two to six weeks . However , he said it has been “ painful ” to watch the Ducks facing the Flames without him in the teams ' first-round playoff series .
Asked if his goal is to return during this series , in which the Ducks hold a 2-0 lead entering Game 3 on Monday night at the Scotiabank Saddledome , Fowler hedged in his reply .
“ My goal is to return as quick as possible without putting the team or myself in jeopardy , ” he said . “ So whenever that is , but yeah , as soon as I can I 'll be back out there . ”
Fowler would n't say if he thought the damaging open-ice hit was delivered on purpose . Giordano was n't penalized but he was challenged to fight later in that game by Ducks defenseman Josh Manson .
“ It 's something that 's in the past that honestly I do n't want to get into too much . I do n't want to be a distraction to the team , ” Fowler said . “ It 's something that happened . It was dealt with at the time . It 's all in the past now . We have a big series . The guys have a big one tonight so I 'm focused on the team and any way I can contribute . ”
But Fowler acknowledged he was frightened at the time of the impact , a fear that was heightened by his history of knee problems . He stopped wearing a knee brace this season but will wear one when he returns , though he said wearing one likely would not have lessened the damage done by the knee-on-knee contact .
“ That 's the scariest time , when you do n't know exactly what it is . You just know that something is wrong , ” he said . “ When things settle down after you 're able to take a deep breath but initially it was scary , yes .
“ Any injury that you suffer as a player is tough . Unfortunately I 've had some incidents lower-body-wise . These collisions happen . It 's part of the game . It 's fast . So I was a little discouraged , to be honest with you . I had a lot of confidence . I was having a lot of fun playing . To kind of suffer a setback like that was tough for me initially . Once we got the diagnosis , it could have been a lot worse . I 'm happy with where I 'm at , how I 'm progressing . My main focus is just to try and get back and contribute to the team any way I can . ”
In his absence , the Ducks have capitalized on their depth on defense and have used Korbinian Holzer and Brandon Montour to replace Fowler and to replace Sami Vatanen , who missed Game 2 because of an upper-body injury . Coach Randy Carlyle said Vatanen looked good in Monday 's morning skate and might play if the training staff and Vatanen believe he can return .
Fowler also said he would wait to see how his knee reacts to Monday 's venture on the ice before planning the next step of his recovery . His initial feeling was positive .
“ It was a good first day , ” he said . “ Obviously the first time on the ice so you 're going to test the waters a little bit , but about as good as it could be for the first day so I 'm happy about that . ”

After the Florence gym floor was flooded by more than an inch of water from a kitchen sink leak , it was n't hard Friday to find a place to insert a blower underneath the ruined maple floor to try to dry it out .
After a dramatic round of knockouts , the FIFA World Cup 2018 contenders have been cut down to eight . Five of the eight Round of 16 matches were absolute thrillers , needing late goals or penalties to decide the winners .
England became the last team to qualify for the World Cup quarter-finals after a dramatic penalty shootout victory against Colombia to join Sweden , Croatia and Russia in the quarter-finals of the bottom half . England is the only former winners of the four teams .
The top half contains more heavyweights , with 1998 champions France taking on two-time winners Uruguay and favourites Brazil set to face dark horses Belgium .
The prevailing theme of the Round of 16 of this World Cup — which is already being labelled as the best edition ever — has been the triumph of the underdog . Heavyweights Argentina , Portugal and Spain have been left behind . And even in defeat , teams like Japan and Denmark won hearts and impressed with their fight .
Before we move on to the quarter-finals — Uruguay vs France , Brazil vs Belgium , Sweden vs England and Russia vs Croatia — let 's look back at some of the memorable moments , shocking statistics and hilarious memes from the Round of 16 .
The knockouts got off on the most dramatic note possible with the sport 's two biggest superstars , Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo , exiting on the same day .
0 - Neither Cristiano Ronaldo nor Lionel Messi have scored a goal in a World Cup knockout match : Ronaldo : 0 goals in 6 games from 25 shots ( 514 mins )
Messi : 0 goals in 8 games from 23 shots ( 756 mins ) Kryptonite. # WorldCup # URUPOR # FRAARG # POR # ARG pic.twitter.com/lgydl2UDb8 — OptaJoe ( @ OptaJoe ) June 30 , 2018

Favourites Brazil will come up against Belgium 's 'golden generation ' in Kazan on Friday while an exciting young France side spearheaded by Kylian Mbappe take on a shrewd Uruguay outfit in Nizhny Novgorod .
Eden Hazard , Romelu Lukaku , Dries Mertens and Kevin De Bruyne are likely to give Brazil 's defence the biggest test of their campaign so far , although the South Americans have only conceded once in four matches .
France never got out of first gear in easing through the group stage but turned on the style as Mbappe dazzled in a classic 4-3 victory over Argentina to set up the clash with Uruguay .
Uruguay 's success has been built on a solid defence led by Atletico Madrid pair Jose Gimenez and Diego Godin , with the old-fashioned strike partnership of Luis Suarez and Edinson Cavani doing the damage at the other end with five goals between them .
On Saturday , England play their quarter-final against Sweden in Samara , with a last-four clash against either Croatia or Russia up for grabs .
No South American sides have won on European soil since a Pele-inspired Brazil 60 years ago , but in a World Cup of shocks and surprises , nothing can be taken for granted .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The United States for the first time in years is sending its diplomat responsible for foreign military sales to the Singapore Airshow to promote U.S.-made weapons , a U.S. official said on Thursday , as the State Department prepares for an overseas arms sales push .
The attendance of Ambassador Tina Kaidanow at the Feb. 6-10 air show , the most important in the Asia Pacific region , is aimed at boosting sales for U.S. arms manufacturers such as F-35 jets made by Lockheed Martin Corp and missile manufactured by Raytheon Co .
President Donald Trump 's administration is nearing completion of a new “ Buy American ” initiative that calls for U.S. military attaches and diplomats to play a much bigger role in the sale of billions of dollars more in business overseas .
“ We will be working at strengthening our advocacy at every level of the embassy , from your commercial officer , up through your ambassador , ” the official , who spoke on condition of anonymity told reporters on Thursday .
Singapore could be seen as the test case for the Trump administration 's new strategy of having the Pentagon and the U.S. State Department take a more active role in securing foreign arms deals , which require State Department approval .
For the first time since at least 2009 , the U.S. delegation at the air show will include the top State Department official overseeing arms sales . Kaidanow holds that role with the title principal deputy assistant secretary in the Bureau of Political-Military Affairs .
The U.S. exported $ 49.5 billion of aerospace and defence products to Asia-Pacific in 2016 , compared to European demand of $ 49.8 billion , according to U.S. Department of Commerce data .
The official said of the “ Buy America ” initiative , “ I would expect with all of the energy the U.S. government is putting behind this , as well as all of the energy the companies are putting behind this , that I would hope to see very good numbers ” for foreign military sales .
The State Department said in a statement that Kaidanow “ will hold consultations on defence trade issues and promote more than 150 U.S. companies and trade organizations exhibiting the latest aerospace technologies . ”
Demand for U.S.-made arms is high and foreign military sales in fiscal 2017 , comprising the final months of Obama 's term and much of Trump 's first year in office , climbed to $ 42 billion , compared to $ 31 billion in the prior year , according to the U.S. Defense Security Cooperation Agency .
Remy Nathan , vice president for international affairs at the Aerospace Industries Association aid , “ The Asia-Pacific region was our industry 's largest regional export destination for several years before Europe overtook it in 2016 . ”
The B.C . government is changing real estate laws in an effort to prevent flipping of condos from one buyer to another before they are built .
Finance Minister Carole James presented legislation Tuesday to require real estate developers to collect and report information on pre-sale condo assignments , to enforce the collection of property transfer tax on buyers .
“ For too long , people who resell condos before they have been built have been inflating real estate prices , without necessarily paying taxes on their gains , ” James said . “ We are making it fairer for people who want to buy a condo , by making sure those who flip pre-sale condos pay their fair share . ”
James said the information will not be publicly available , but will be shared with the Canada Revenue Agency , to make sure that capital gains tax as well as provincial property taxes are paid .
JHANG/SAHIWAL-Four persons including two children died in separate incidents occurred in different areas on Monday .
In Jhang , two persons died and four others sustained injuries in collision between a truck and car here on Monday .
Rescue sources said that a speeding truck collided with a car on Cantt Road in Shorkot . The car was badly damaged in the accident , resulting in death of two persons while four others got critical wounds .
The bodies and injured were shifted to hospital for medico-legal formalities . The police impounded both vehicles and registered a case into the incident .
In Sahiwal , two children died in separate incidents here on Monday .
Police informed that five-year-old Husnain , son of Zaheer Ahmad , resident of Mokal Colony Sahiwal died of electrocution during a flag-hoisting ceremony . Another minor Sullah Faryaad died after falling from his rooftop . He sustained injuries and was shifted to DHQ Hospital Sahiwal where he succumbed to his wounds .
No matter how much you hear people say it before you give birth , there 's one paradox of parenting that will always catch you off-guard : even though the days can feel super long and tiring when you have a baby , it also feels like it 's going by way too fast . As exciting as it is to watch your little one grow , it 's also really bittersweet , and it 's a parenting reality that Khloe Kardashian 's sweet Instagram photo of True captures so perfectly .
Despite the difficult personal drama surrounding Kardashian 's relationship with partner Tristan Thompson , it seems that the reality star 's one and only priority since her daughter 's April 12 arrival has simply been squeezing every ounce of joy from new motherhood that she can . On Twitter Tuesday , the reality star admitted that sometimes she `` still ca n't believe [ she 's ] a mommy , '' according to People , and called her baby girl her `` bestie for life . '' One day later , Kardashian shared an adorable photo of True on Instagram from when she was only two weeks old , and though only five more weeks have passed since then , it already sounds like Kardashian is feeling eager to slow down the clock .
Kardashian shared the photo of her infant daughter rocking the bunny filter , and called her `` my baby bunny . '' But as proud as she sounds , it also seems like she 's becoming well acquainted with the simultaneously sweet and heartbreaking moments of motherhood : at the bottom of the pic , she wrote , `` She was only 2 weeks in this pic . Why is the time flying ! ! She will be 7 weeks tomorrow . ''
Of course , to parents with older kids , a 7-week-old baby is still practically a newborn , and it may seem funny that Kardashian is already freaking out . But if you 've spent your entire pregnancy eagerly awaiting your baby 's arrival , like Kardashian did , it makes sense that it would be really hard to wrap your head around the idea that seven weeks have already gone by in your child 's life . And while I 'd love to say the struggle gets easier , the truth is that it always seems to feel difficult to accept that certain milestones have already come and gone forever , no matter how many years have passed .
Although it seemed reasonable to think that Kardashian might want to head back to California after giving birth so she could be with her family ( including sisters Kim and Kylie , who have also had baby girls this year ) , it seems that she 's opted to remain in Cleveland after all , where she shares a home with Thompson . But , judging from her social media posts at least , it seems to be working out pretty well .
On Tuesday , Kardashian wrote in a post on her app that she was actually really enjoying the `` eat , sleep , potty '' schedule that infants follow in their first few months , explaining that she `` [ loves ] a routine , '' and adding , `` not going to lie , this works for me . '' And earlier this month , the reality star shared a video on Instagram for True 's one-month `` birthday , '' and it was honestly just too adorable for words :
The hard part for Kardashian though ( and , let 's be honest , for all parents everywhere ) is that , no matter how much you try to live in the moment and commit everything about your baby to memory , there will never actually be a way to change the fact that each stage will feel like it went by far too quickly — even if it did n't feel that way at the time . All we can do , it seems , is tried our best to enjoy every stage that comes and goes . And while True might still be a tiny infant , and it seems that 's something Kardashian already has figured out .
Pope Francis , in his new year messages at St. Peter 's Basilica suggested that “ we should acknowledge that we need the Lord to enlighten us ” to the faithful and the tourists who came to celebrate together and hear his message . In general , reviewing the various messages in recent days from this pontiff , it seems Francis wanted to express hope and encouragement to the people who came to share , worship and celebrate with him at the Vatican . And Pope Francis clearly sees new opportunities for improvement with the arrival of a new year , per the report from Crux . He added we should consider the infant born in Bethlehem to learn something more about God . As the pontiff points out in his message , there was a plan . “ God wanted to be close , in the flesh , to those who feel lost , hurt , discouraged , afraid , inconsolable , or who feel burdened by loneliness so that sin , despair and exclusion… ” But Pope Francis ' new year messaging seemed one designed to preach to the faithful and give hope to all persons seeking an official communication from the popular pontiff . Considering the message of the birth of the Lord in a Bethlehem manger , said the pontiff , would help in the contemplation of the God-Child as the old year ends and a new year begins . He stated that “ the times ahead call for bold and hope-filled initiatives , as well as the renunciation of vain self-promotion and endless concern with appearances. ” If people were to make an effort and “ return to the sources and roots of our faith , ” said Francis , then that faith would become a new hope . “ In Jesus , faith becomes hope ; it becomes a leaven and a blessing. ” Pope Francis arrives in the Paul VI Hall at the Vatican . [ Image by Alessandra Tarantino/AP Images ] As RadioVaticana describes it , the Pope meant to explain “ the logic of the manger ” as being one of “ closeness ” which does not allow for exclusion or divisiveness . He encouraged all “ to contemplate how God has been present throughout this year and to remind ourselves that every age , every moment is the bearer of graces and blessings. ” Later , per Voux Magazine , Pope Francis told another crowd of believers that our modern means of communication may be “ cauterizing our hearts and making us lose the capacity for tenderness and wonder , for pity and compassion. ” From the YouTube video below , Francis also wanted to speak clearly to those feeling alone in the world . “ To celebrate Mary as Mother of God and our mother at the beginning of the new year means recalling a certainty that will accompany our days , ” said Pope Francis in the first new year message , “ we are a people with a Mother ; we are not orphans. ” He added that it also “ reminds us that we are not interchangeable items of merchandise or information processors . We are children , we are family , we are God 's People. ” Addressing the crowds of faithful at the Vatican , the 80 year old Pope again warned the people of societies which risk becoming “ cold and calculating ” and losing compassion , per the information from Reuters . Quoted in that story , the pontiff tried to encourage “ all men of good will. ” “ I ask the Lord to sustain all men of good will to courageously roll up their sleeves to confront the plague of terrorism and this stain of blood that is covering the world with a shadow of fear and a sense of loss. ” And with the terrorism attack recently in Istanbul , NBC reports that this was also weighing upon the Pope 's mind . He took time to urge leaders to work together in the effort to fight the “ plague of terrorism. ” In his New Year 's message he told the faithful that “ a bloodstain ” covered the world as it began the new year 2017 . The Istanbul nightclub attack killed at least 39 people , per the report . The Pope , however , took time to express the pain he said he felt over this , and he prayed for the victims as well . “ Pained , I express my closeness to the Turkish people . I pray for the many victims and for the wounded and for the entire nation in mourning. ” Pope Francis ' new year 's messages are usually well-received , as he is known for his humility , and he tends to emphasize God 's mercy and love for people .

Churchill Street in Baie d'Urfé could be a sample of what makes the town distinct — the homes are on fairly large lots ( minimum size in the town is around 15,000 square feet ) and the houses themselves are small — usually one-storey bungalows . So social media began buzzing recently when a listing appeared for a modern , multi-storey house on a corner lot that currently has a simple , single-family house .
The plans call for a six-bedroom , three-bathroom home that would occupy the plot on the corner of Westchester and Churchill . Neighbour Giovanni Farinacci said he supports the project , saying that it would likely raise his property values .
“ It looks like a beautiful home . Obviously it 's a big home , ” said Farinacci . “ How big ? Well , we 'll have to see once it 's up . ”
On Facebook , some Baie-d'Urfé residents wondered about the price of the new dwelling ( the sellers are asking $ 2.25 million ) and the look ( they wonder if it fits in with the rest of the neighbourhood ) . But currently the advertised traits of the home are just proposals . According to Baie-d'Urfé officials , the owners do not have — and have not applied for — a building permit or a demolition permit . This fact was not initially made clear in the real estate listing .
“ I 'm certain that no demolition permit has been approved for this house , and if a request for a permit has come in I am unaware of it , ” said Janet Ryan , a Baie-d'Urfé town councillor who is also the chairperson of the town 's demolition committee .
Global News contacted the owner , Sandra Mateus , about the listing and she changed it to reflect the property 's current permit situation shortly afterward . She said the permit scenario was n't initially mentioned due to an oversight by the realtor .
While the proposed construction may have raised some eyebrows , some people in the town believe it 's simply the sort of change the town should have to learn to accept .
“ I think change is good and I think change is coming here , ” said Linus Weidemann , who lives in the area .

EastEnders fans were devastated last night as Roxy and Ronnie Mitchell tragically died in a swimming pool .
Viewers of the BBC soap were shocked as Samantha Womack and Rita Simons ' characters were written out for good .
But many were also confused as to how they both drowned , and why Roxy did n't manage to just swim back to the surface .
Roxy has been in a downhill spiral for weeks now .

Even the night before the wedding , she 'd taken drugs and ended up in such a state that she had to be saved by her mum Glenda Mitchell and brother Danny Mitchell .
While viewers saw her change her mind over taking another hit prior to sleeping with Max Branning , she could have easily had some off-screen .
And let 's not forget , the Mitchell sisters had drunk a bottle of champagne each on the rooftop just before jumping into the pool .
While many viewers might be questioning why Roxy could n't just swim to safety , the likely explanation would be drugs and booze in her system left her unable to .

As for Ronnie , she was too worried about her sister to question how heavy her massive wedding dress would be when she jumped in to save her .
With her still wearing the veil when she rescued Roxy , it easily could 've got tangled in the filters , also hindering her from getting out .
Now the Mitchell sisters are dead , what 's next for Albert Square ?

Adds Cheban , who in 2010 starred “ The Spin Crowd , ” his own show on E ! : “ FoodGod is the first brand to cross over between reality TV and the world of being an influencer . ”
When the series between the Vegas Golden Knights and San Jose Sharks begins , one thing is certain . The series will be between two teams with a strong emphasis on ‘ team ' . This is n't a series with a bunch of stars . There 's only one player on either team likely to make the Hockey Hall of Fame , and that guy , Joe Thornton , happens to be injured .
If you had a multiple choice question for the list of reasons each team succeeded this season , you 'd select the box labeled “ all of the above . ”
Eighteen Skaters
When the 18 skaters hit the ice for each team , both teams know it 'll take all 18 to make a difference . Neither team thinks much about shortening its bench or worries much about specific matchups . They are more concerned about keeping up the intensity for 60 minutes ; more if needed . To accomplish this , it means everyone plays significant minutes . And everyone has to find ways to contribute .
Some have described Vegas as a team with four ‘ second lines ' , meaning they lack the top line talent , but every line is good enough to be another team 's second best line . I find this logic odd considering what the Vegas top line has accomplished this season .
William Karlsson ( 43 goals , plus-49 ! ! ) , Jonathan Marchessault ( 75 points , plus-36 ! ! ) and Reilly Smith ( 60 points in 67 games , plus-31 ) put up numbers which are top line . Not just the top line for a team , but the top line in all hockey . The individuals may not have long resumes of greatness , but their collective 2017-18 resume is absolutely great .
The Sharks might not match the Vegas top line , but they have great depth . Indeed , it 's hard to figure out which line is the Sharks top line because two groups are both comparably good . The line most people consider the second line features the Sharks ' top two goal scorers , Logan Couture and Tomas Hertl . The Sharks bottom six is as good as any in the league .
The Eighteenth Skater
For each team , the last player in the lineup played a big role in the opening round series .
Only one skater for Vegas , William Carrier , played less than ten minutes in any game in the series against the Los Angeles Kings . Carrier was the player who frustrated Drew Doughty so much in the series ' first game that Doughty went after Carrier late in the contest . Doughty crossed the line with a hit to the head and took a one-game suspension as a result — the Kings could have used Doughty in that game . Doughty , the NHL 's regular season ice time leader , missed the game the Kings lost in double overtime .
The Sharks used Marcus Sorensen the least of any player in their series against the Anaheim Ducks . He was the lone Sharks ' skater to average under 10 minutes of ice time per game . But Sorensen was a major contributor , scoring a game-tying goal in Game 2 . In the Game 3 romp , Sorensen scored the Sharks third goal and assisted on the fourth to break the game open . In the series finale , Sorensen scored the game 's first goal , and considering the final score was 2-1 , it mattered a bunch .
He was also effective on the penalty kill . Sorensen was on the ice for four Sharks even strength goals ( tied for best on the team ) , and none against ( also tied for best on the team ) . One could make the case that the Sharks ' eighteenth skater was also their most valuable skater in the series .
Calling All Sharks and Golden Knights
For Vegas , winning was about everybody . The seven goals against the Kings came from seven different goal scorers . Twelve players had points against the Kings , including 10 of the 13 forwards who played in the series . Vegas head coach Gerard Gallant , who 'll soon win the Jack Adams Award as the NHL 's top bench boss this season , has a team which finds its comfort zone in close games . In Game 1 , they held a 1-0 lead for over 55 minutes . In Game 4 , for over 35 minutes . And won both games by the score of 1-0 .
For the Sharks , it was , well , also about everybody . The series stats against the Ducks are misleading in some respects , as the 8-1 win in Game 3 distorts the numbers . But like the Golden Knights , the Sharks managed to get just about everyone on the scoresheet , with 15 of the 18 skaters notching at least one point . The three Sharks who did n't have a point ( a defenseman from each pairing ) were on the ice for nine of the Sharks ten even strength goals , and only two goals against .
Relentless Hockey
Vegas loves to play at a relentless pace , looking to pounce on the moments where opponents lose track of the play . The Sharks are n't quite as relentless , but they also know how to take advantage of an opponent 's lapse . It showed repeatedly against Anaheim . Teams can not play relentless hockey over an extended series without the benefit of competitive depth .
The Golden Knights ice time leader among forwards in their opening series was William Karlsson . Karlsson averaged under 20 minutes per night in the games which ended in regulation . It is a lot easier to have fresh legs when the head coach balances out the ice time .
Among the Sharks , only Joe Pavelski played more minutes than he probably should against the Ducks . At 33 , it 's a good idea to limit his minutes to when they matter most . Playing Pavelski for almost 20 minutes in Game 3 's 8-1 victory was n't the best idea .
In a series where the pace is going to get pushed , it 'll be up to Sharks head coach Peter DeBoer to keep Pavelski fresh . Of course , the lengthy break between series is a good start .
Goalies Stealing the Show
The goalies have been stars of the show for both teams . Vegas won four games against the Los Angeles Kings , each by one goal . The Kings managed just three goals the entire series . Marc-Andre Fleury was superb and the Vegas skaters played with supreme confidence knowing Fleury was dominating the net .
It was n't much different for the Sharks — Martin Jones also posted superb numbers in the opening round . He provided his team confidence , allowing just four Anaheim scores . The Sharks confidence allowed them to be aggressive and it showed in the enormous number of odd-man rushes San Jose had in the series .
Caution in San Jose , Excitement in Vegas
While both teams swept their opening round series , by the numbers , the Sharks sweep looks more impressive , but I 'm not sure it was . Their opponents , the Anaheim Ducks , decided it was more important to try and intimidate the Sharks with dirty play than it was to win hockey games . The Ducks lost the first three games , and self-inflicted wounds were a huge part of it . The final game was a different story , the Ducks were outstanding and the Sharks were fortunate to eke out the win .
There is plenty of excitement for this series . The Golden Knights are drawing big crowds – to their practices . Every regular season game between the two teams was close . Two games went into overtime . The other two were one-goal games ( excluding an empty net score ) .
The Sharks were much deeper than Anaheim and the Golden Knights were much deeper than Los Angeles . Depth made a difference in both series . In this series , we 'll see two teams where depth units like fourth lines and third defensive pairings are unusually important . It 's truly being a team game for both San Jose and Vegas . I expect we 'll see quite a series .

Messi : A man on a mission
It 's that time of the season where national teams play friendly matches to test their tactics and plans for the final time before the World Cup . Yes , the international friendlies are much awaited by fans nowadays . One of the most talked about team , Argentina played Haiti in a friendly match .
Sampaoli has not been very clear with his lineups and it was a great opportunity for him to try and implement his ideas . Haiti is clearly a much weaker side and it would allow Argentina to dominate the ball and impose their game for 90 minutes .
The match ended 4-0 in favour of 'La Albiceleste ' . It was a very convincing victory with Messi grabbing a hattrick and Aguero adding one to his name . Recent performances by the Argentina national team have not been great but this match showed what makes them a contender for the World Cup .
Let 's have a look at things that went in favour for Jorge Sampaoli :
# 3 Starting Eduardo Salvio at right back
Argentina v Haiti - International Friendly
Instead of putting the experienced Sevilla full-back , Mercado , Sampaoli opted Salvio to do the job in the right back spot . A couple of hours before the match , it was rumoured that Salvio would start against Haiti but not playing him in the midfield was a smart move .
Salvio was in action throughout the game . Running up and down the right flank , he hardly made any major mistakes . His pace was fully utilized by Sampaoli . Salvio also showed great composure on the ball and even connected well with his teammates .
Mercado is more physical and experienced but lacks pace and attacking abilities like Salvio . Sampaoli was aware and thus opted for a more attacking full-back in his defensive back-four .
After the fiercely contested Test series between the top-ranked Test teams India and South Africa ended 2-1 in home side 's favour . The attention shifted to coloured clothing cricket where both the countries once again occupy the top spots in the ranking . Only difference before the start of the ODI series was as opposed to Tests , India followed the Proteas in the ranking .
Before the start of the series , there was much excitement among the viewers as well as pundits from across the cricketing world .
Firstpost caught up with Former South Africa cricketer Daryll Cullinan who said that there is a lot of excitement for ODI series in South Africa and there were a lot of expectations .
`` Both teams are very good . India is a terrific one-day team . South Africa has a formidable ODI side and probably the preparations for 2019 World Cup in England starts now , '' Cullinan , who is also an ESPNcricinfo expert panelist , said .
All the three Tests were very exciting and South Africa won the series as they capitalized on their chances better compared to India . The 70-Tests veteran added . `` The Test series have gone nicely and just gives us an indication how the remainder of the tour is going to be . ''
Just like the Test series , India is chasing history in the shorter format as well having not one a bilateral ODI series in South Africa .
The 50-year old believes with the confidence of winning the Test at Wanderers in mind , the current Indian squad have a real chance of winning their maiden ODI series in South Africa .
`` India bat deep and have got some world-class players . The squad has got a great opportunity to win the series , probably better chance than any other previous Indian ODI side that I have seen visit South Africa , '' he said .
On the other hand , Cullinan said , `` South Africa 's batting order seems little unsettled with AB de Villiers out of the first three ODIs . ''
After losing captain Faf du Plessis due to a finger injury , South Africa 's problems would have increased two-fold , as they will miss not only an able captain but also a frontline batsman .
He also added that With World Cup 2019 in mind South Africa will look to experiment in terms of their playing combination .
`` South Africa will not necessarily focus on winning , but instead providing exposure to few players and give some players opportunity . They also want to get into a good winning habit . Winning at the end of the day is the greatest confidence booster . We will have wait and see what their approach is but I have a feeling they will experiment a bit more , '' said Cullinan .
He also threw light on Khaya Zondo , who is yet to make his debut in international cricket and Aiden Markram .
`` Zondo has captained his domestic side and despite his talent he has n't been prolific in domestic competitions , but it serves as a great opportunity for him to prove himself , '' he said .
Whereas Markram has some experience at Test level and made his ODI debut last year against Bangladesh .
`` He is someone who is a very capable batsman and can bat anywhere in top five , '' said Cullinan , unaware that he would be captaining Proteas second ODI onwards .
With Markram pitchforked into captaincy in place of the injured du Plessis , he will now call the shots on what position best suits him in the batting order and it will be interesting to see when he decides to go out to bat .
Cullinan was Proteas batting 's mainstay for a considerable period of time in the nineties . He spoke about India 's number four conundrum with Indian management trying multiple players at the position . With Virat Kohli clearing the air in the pre-match conference , Cullinan seemed to agree upon the idea of having Ajinkya Rahane at that slot .
`` I think ( Ajinkya ) Rahane at number four is a good move , especially if you lose wickets early on , you need that sort of player to come in at four . I wo n't be surprised to see him at number four in England as well . He might be ideal for in those conditions . He needs to be given a prolonged run ''
Rahane played a perfect anchor , scoring 79 off 86 balls , joining forces with captain Virat Kohli ( 112 ) for a matching-winning 189-run stand for the third wicket in the first ODI .
On Rohit Sharma 's poor record in South Africa where the Indian limited overs vice-captain has scored at 12.28 in the seven matches , he played before the first ODI in which he was dismissed for 20 .
Cullinan said , '' In these conditions , he needs to be a little more cautious . I think he has to play the longer innings with a bit more patience . I think if he does that , we know how heavily he can score in the end . ''
Putting behind the pitch controversy of the third Test that was played at the Wanderers , Cullinan said it was just one-off incident and the one-day series will see good wickets .
`` I expect them to prepare good One-day pitches , good batting wickets . Generally anything roundabout 250-270 will be a good score in South Africa , '' he said .
Cullinan , however , was optimistic that the Proteas would pip the visitors 3-2 factoring in a game being washed out , in spite of agreeing to India 's chances of a series triumph . That confidence could well have taken a blow after the hammering the hosts got at what was considered their fortress at Kingsmead , especially against the Indians . Du Plessis ' unforeseen exit from the series would not have helped to boost that confidence either .
BRUSSELS : A Belgian minister arrived by bike to a news conference to promote cycling on Tuesday , only to find it had been stolen when he left half an hour later .
Ben Weyts , minister of mobility for the Dutch-speaking region of Flanders , unveiled a plan to invest 300 million euros ( US $ 320 million ) in cycle lanes until 2019 , as part of a wider program to promote alternative modes of transport .
`` We left the bike in racks at the station and locked it , '' a spokesman for the minister said . `` When we got back half an hour later , it was gone . ''
While Belgium is a country obsessed with cycling as a sport , cars are the main method of commuting to work , leading to some of the worst road congestion in Europe .
The minister had to call his driver to pick him up from the station in Halle , just south of Brussels , the spokesman said , and hoped police would discover the bicycle thief with the help of security camera footage .

Muharrem Ince , the presidential candidate of the main opposition Republican People 's Party ( CHP ) in the June 24 elections , continued his thinly-veiled criticism of Chairman Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu on Wednesday while signaling an active period in the aftermath of the elections which concluded with incumbent President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan and its ruling Justice and Development Party 's ( AK Party ) victory .
Ince started his countrywide tour to thank all electorates from eastern province of Erzurum , a traditionally conservative region where Ince received 9.9 percent of the votes , compared to the CHP 's 4.4 percent .
The nationwide performance of Ince also overshadowed that of the CHP 's , as he received 30.6 percent of the votes in the presidential election compared to the CHP 's 22.6 percent in the parliamentary vote . This situation reignited the leadership debate in the CHP with calls demanding Kılıçdaroğlu , who has lost in all elections since he took up the chairmanship role in 2011 , to step down .
During his visit to the CHP 's provincial headquarters , Ince announced that he will launch a membership campaign targeting the youth from Erzurum , where he could not visit during his energetic campaign that saw 107 rallies in 51 days .
`` I will make the opening of the campaign that I will launch on Sep. 9 in Erzurum . This campaign is named 'Let 's rule Turkey with the youth . ' Right now , the CHP has 1.2 million members , and I , from Sep.9 , 2018 to Sep.9 , 2019 or [ in other words ] a year , will make 1.25 million youngsters new members [ of the CHP ] . We have received 15 million votes , our goal is to receive 30 million votes , '' Ince said .
Regarding the leadership debate , Ince said that there is no chaos in the CHP , and that he has a brotherly relationship with Kılıçdaroğlu . However , he went on to say that the CHP lost the most recent elections and there are no excuses for this .
`` Those who refuse that they have lost can not win . If you lose , you retreat , and then make your preparations [ for the next ] , you do not make excuses , '' he said , in words both attributed to Kılıçdaroğlu .
The two were involved in a media debate on Tuesday as Ince revealed to reporters that he suggested to Kılıçdaroğlu to call for a leadership congress in which Ince would run as the chairmanship candidate and Kılıçdaroğlu would be declared honorary chairman . Saying that this offer was made in a private dinner between the two on Monday , Kılıçdaroğlu described Ince 's comments as `` political impoliteness , '' while the CHP administration also criticized Ince , who hit back earlier Wednesday saying he had `` no secret agenda . ''
In an interview with Turkish daily Hürriyet , Kılıçdaroğlu ruled out an extraordinary congress and claimed the CHP was successful in the elections , despite a three percent drop in the party 's votes from 25.3 percent in the Nov. 2015 elections .
Despite Kılıçdaroğlu 's rejection , several party delegates and provincial administration members have voiced support for a congress . A notable call came Wednesday from Izmir Metropolitan Mayor Aziz Kocaoğlu , who has been in the position since 2004 in Turkey 's third largest city dubbed as the CHP 's `` fortress . '' In a short statement , Kocaoğlu said the June 24 elections made urgent a change in the CHP mandatory and that this was the demand of the overall public opinion and party support base . `` This change taking place with the pioneership of our chairman would greatly enforce our party , '' Kocaoğlu said .
However , since Kılıçdaroğlu is dominant over the party organization and the delegates , it is highly unlikely that Ince and his supporters will push for a leadership congress against Kılıçdaroğlu 's will . Before being nominated by the CHP administration to run as the party 's presidential candidate , Ince unsuccessfully ran twice against Kılıçdaroğlu in party congresses in 2014 and 2018 . In the 2014 congress , 740 delegates voted for Kılıçdaroğlu while Ince received the backing of 415 delegates . In 2018 , 790 delegates voted for Kılıçdaroğlu , while İnce received only 447 votes . Ince 's supporters have been criticizing Kılıçdaroğlu for piling up the party with delegates who are close to him . Currently , there are 1,276 delegates in the CHP , and a chairman candidate needs the backing of that least one-tenth of the delegates in order to run in a congress . Moreover , Ince would need the support of at least 650 delegates to push for a leadership congress according to the party 's bylaws , a number unlikely to be reached if Kılıçdaroğlu blocks such a move .
After his visit to the CHP provincial headquarters , Ince visited the provincial headquarters of the Good Party ( IP ) , which was part of the Nation Alliance with the CHP and Felicity Party ( SP ) in the June 24 elections .
Here , Ince said that he will be a candidate in the upcoming presidential elections . `` Politics is a long-running business . No one can guarantee whether the next presidential elections will be held in 5 years , maybe it will take place within 2 years . That 's what we have to be prepared for . ''
( AP ) – Police officials in Bermuda say the body of U.S. student Mark Dombroski was found at the base of a colonial era fort in the British Island territory .
Acting Assistant Commissioner James Howard says authorities have not determined a cause of death of the 19-year-old student from Media , Pennsylvania , and that forensic experts are still at the scene .
Howard says they have not ruled out foul play in the death .
He expressed his “ heartfelt condolences to his family and friends ” after an intensive search for local authorities , volunteers , and relatives of the student .
SCIO , N.Y. ( WIVB ) – A black bear was spotted by an Wyoming County school Friday morning .
Scio Central Schools went into lockout mode as a precaution around 9:45 a.m. Friday after the bear was spotted walking on the roadway in front of the school .
This video was taken by a student .
Principal Dawn Race said that no students or staff were in danger .
The DEC was also notified .
LONDON : The time for talking is fast approaching as Mercedes start a new year with Formula One waiting for a big announcement about who is going to replace retired world champion Nico Rosberg alongside Lewis Hamilton .
The team made clear before the Christmas break that they would have nothing to say before the full return to work on Tuesday .
There is evidence , however , to suggest the decision is all but made .
According to the motorsport.com website , Finnish driver Valtteri Bottas was at the Mercedes factory at Brackley before Christmas to meet team engineers and try out the cockpit of the 2017 car .
Bottas has raced for Mercedes-powered Williams since his Formula One debut in 2013 and Mercedes team boss Toto Wolff , a former Williams shareholder , has also been involved with the 27-year-old 's management team .
The Finn is the bookmakers ' favourite to replace Rosberg , who quit unexpectedly last month only five days after winning his first title , but other elements may need to slide into place before a deal can be announced .
One would be for Brazilian veteran Felipe Massa to agree to abandon his announced retirement and return to Williams as Bottas 's replacement .
Claire Williams , deputy principal of the team founded by her father , indicated last month that Williams would be open to Bottas leaving if `` an experienced , credible alternative was available '' - such as the 35-year-old Massa .
Pascal Wehrlein , the 22-year-old Mercedes reserve driver who might have expected to take Rosberg 's place but lacks experience , is another piece of the jigsaw .
The young German raced for tail-enders Manor last year , scoring the only point for a financially-challenged team whose future remains uncertain , but is expected to join Ferrari-engined Sauber alongside Sweden 's Marcus Ericsson .
Wolff , in his final words to the team before the break , gave no clues but emphasised that Mercedes ' best interests would always come first .
`` Our position in the spotlight puts every decision taken and every word spoken under an intense microscope , '' said the Austrian . `` They are debated passionately among our fans and interpreted by the media .
`` But there has been enough talking , now . This is the period for calm and considered reflection , to savour our achievements and prepare for the next campaign . ''
With testing due to start in Spain late next month , ahead of the opening race in Australia on March 26 , the factories are now entering their busiest period . The time for reflection is coming to an end .

I 've been playing Animal Crossing : Pocket Camp for nearly two months now and have become familiar enough with the mechanics that I 've got a nitpick or two . If Nintendo never changes a single thing about ACPC , I 'll still play it multiple times per day , every day , possibly for the rest of my life , but here are some of the things I 'd like to see change in a future update .
General user interface changes that would make the game better
These are some game design features that I 'd like to see , or I 'd like to see done differently in ACPC .
Make it easier for me to see when friends need help in Shovelstrike Quarry - Right now , the only way you can tell if friends need help is to visit your Friends tab . There is no indication that someone has requested your help . A little red notification dot , similar to the one you see when you get kudos or new friends . For that matter , I do n't need to see when someone has given me kudos .
When I get a fish or a bug or pick fruit , I 'd like to see how many of that material I already have . It 's a little annoying to have to go into the Items tab and scroll until I find the material just to see how many I have .
More notifications ! We are asked to allow ACPC to send notifications , but the only ones I 've received had to do with the new event . I 'd like to know when my crafting items have finished , when my friends need a hand in Shovelstrike Quarry , or when fruit has re-spawned . These would be very helpful notifications .
Why is it so hard to buy items from my friends ?
The worst design feature in ACPC is the friends ' market box . If you want to buy , say , a couple of pears , you have to open your Friends tab , tap on a friend , visit the friend 's campsite , view the friend 's market box , and then , if the friend has the pears , you can buy them .
Here 's how it should change :
In the Friends List , we should be able to see every item in our friends ' market boxes , not just the four most expensive ones .
We should be able to go directly to a friend 's market box instead of having to visit their campsite first .
We should be able to search our friends ' market boxes for materials . For example , if I want pears , I should be able to type `` pear '' into the search field and only the friends that have pears in their market box will appear in the search results .
When scrolling down our list of friends , when we tap on one , our place should be remembered so that when we go back to the Friend List , it does n't start back at the top again .
Some fun Animal Crossing content I 'd like to see
Though I 'd be happy just the way ACPC is , there are a few Animal Crossing iconic things that I 'd jump for joy if were added to Pocket Camp .
Campsite naming - When you first start a game of Animal Crossing , you 're given the opportunity to name the city you 're about to become mayor of . I 'd love to be able to give the campground a name in ACPC .
- When you first start a game of Animal Crossing , you 're given the opportunity to name the city you 're about to become mayor of . I 'd love to be able to give the campground a name in ACPC . A museum so you can store your rare items - In Animal Crossing , players are able to show off their collection by storing stuff in a museum in town . It would be awesome ( and helpful for freeing up market boxes ) to be able to have a museum in ACPC — or in keeping with the campground theme — a visitor 's center where you can show off that rare Rainbow Trout or Jeweled Beetle you caught .

The ability to leave notes for other players - Kudos are nice and all , but I 'd like to tell a friend that their outfit is cute or that I love how they set up their Campsite . Notes could be left inside the camper . Nintendo could even set up pre-made messages to avoid concerns about harassment or inappropriate language .
So how can I tell Nintendo about my great ideas ?
There 's actually a way to send Nintendo a message directly from inside ACPC .
Tap More in the bottom right corner of the screen . Tap Misc . Tap Customer Support . Tap Feedback .
In the feedback section , you can select `` Other Thoughts ( Requests , Ect . ) as the topic and then let Nintendo know about the things you 'd like to see added or changed in the game . With enough feedback , we might at least get that market box horror fixed .
What changes would you like to see in Animal Crossing : Pocket Camp ?
Are you completely satisfied with how Nintendo designed ACPC ? What kind of changes would you ask the company to make if you could ?
This university debuted its Discovery District in February . The district , which was formerly known as M Square , is composed of academic spaces , amenities and businesses stretching along Route 1 , which includes The Hotel at the University of Maryland . The move also contributes to the Greater College Park Initiative — a $ 2 billion public-private project to revitalize Route 1 and to improve the relationship between this university and the city of College Park .
The city received a number of calls from Calgarians who noticed a significant amount of smoke in the air on the west edge overnight .
The calls came in just before midnight with people wondering if there was a fire in the area .
The Calgary fire department investigated the situation and confirmed a strong shift in wind direction pushed smoke into Calgary from the Verdant Creek fire , which is still raging in the Rockies .

Calgary 's biggest performing arts centre was n't even open when Wes Jenkins starting working in the building 's carpentry shop .
“ I started here back in 1984 , ” Jenkins told Global News on Monday . “ I built this floor we 're standing on . ”
After decades of working his way up , Jenkins is now operations manager at Arts Commons and is still familiar with all the backstage equipment .

“ The stage rigging , all these ropes that allow scenery to be flown in and out No fancy motors , no fancy technology ” he said “ Some things are still done the old-fashioned way . ”
Now he 's preparing to leave it all behind , retiring after all those years and all those shows .
“ The thing I 'll miss most is just the people and the craziness of our world , ” Jenkins said .
His decades of helping put on live shows have left him with some great memories .
“ One of my favourite things was when we had Johnny Cash performing here and we got to hang out with [ him ] between shows , ” Jenkins said . “ We shared prayers and dinner — fried chicken . Nothing fancy . ”
Jenkins says putting in new seating in all the Arts Commons venues is one of the accomplishments he 's most proud of .
“ I literally sat in every seat as a test drive to make sure that they were comfortable . ”
Jenkins will wrap up his job at the end of April , looking forward to an active life in retirement .
“ I 'm going to travel the world on my bicycle . [ I 'm ] off to Sri Lanka and Bangladesh . ”
The political pivot is an art , and for someone who spent most of his career making people laugh , not an easy one . But Al Franken learned to master the skill in 2008 when the former “ Saturday Night Live ” writer and liberal activist ran as a Democrat against incumbent Minnesota Republican Sen . Norm Coleman and unexpectedly unseated him .
“ I was taught that if Norm Coleman is 20 points ahead of you in the polls and you 're asked , ‘ How do you think you 're going to beat him ? ' The pivot would be , ‘ You know , when I go around Minnesota , Minnesotans do n't care about polls , ' ” he said . “ You see ? That 's a pivot . ” '
Franken did n't do much pivot — a fancy word for changing the subject — at a sold-out appearance on June 6 at Sixth & I Historic Synagogue in Washington to promote his new book , titled with Franken-like faux self-importance “ Giant of the Senate . ”
During the Q-and-A with CNN anchor Jake Tapper , Franken said what he really thinks about President Donald Trump and his administration .
“ They 're not acting like people who have nothing to hide , ” he said of Trump 's cabinet . “ That 's all I 'm saying . And that 's just from 66 years of observing human nature . ”
Franken described his showdown with Attorney General Jeff Sessions during Sessions ' confirmation hearings in January . As he grilled Sessions about his possible contacts with Russian officials during the 2016 presidential campaign , Franken asked Sessions if he would recuse himself from the FBI investigation into alleged Russian efforts to meddle in last November 's election .
Sessions , Franken recounted , responded by answering a question that he had not asked : Sessions said he 'd had no contact with Russian officials . However , he had in fact met with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak twice , and he later recused himself from the FBI investigation .
Sessions “ pivoted from ‘ I 'm not going to talk about recusal ' to ‘ I 'm just going to lie here , ' ” Franken said . “ That was not part of the pivoting thing I was taught . ”
Asked by Tapper what he thought the result of the investigation would be , Franken said he wanted to “ wait and see where the facts lead. ” Then he took a combination jab and laugh line at Trump 's son-in-law Jared Kushner — one of the figures at the center of the Russia investigation .
“ The question will be what did the president know and when did his son-in-law tell him , ” Franken said .
Franken was just getting warmed up . He noted that in his book , he said that he likes Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz more than any of his colleagues do . They all hate him , Franken said .
“ There 's 100 people in the Senate , and your ability to get things done depends on your work being good … and you just have to get along , ” Franken said . “ And [ Cruz ] does n't make an attempt to do that . He 's a toxic co-worker . He 's a guy that microwaves fish . And the only thing he 's done in the Senate is close down the government . ”
Franken 's balance of the serious and silly resonated strongly with the audience .
“ I think he 's doing an amazing job , ” said Fairfax resident Philippa Hindman . “ I think he 's made the transition from being a comedian to being a serious senator and yet retaining that sense of humor and his charm . ”
Bethesda resident Laurie Friedman agreed .
“ I thought it was really funny when he said Ted Cruz was like the office worker who puts fish in the microwave , ” she said .
While Franken has managed to shed much of his comedic demeanor since his arrival in the Senate , it took some time to learn to play it straight .
Franken said on his first day on the job , Sen. Jim DeMint ( R-S.C. ) asked him how things were going on the far left . Franken 's response : “ Great . How are things on the nutcase right ? ”
While this interaction was good-natured , Franken said his jokes got him in trouble the next year , during Supreme Court Justice Elena Kagan 's confirmation hearing . As Sen. Mitch McConnell ( R-Ky. ) , then minority leader , was testifying against Kagan 's nomination , Franken , who was seated behind the dais , made a series of sarcastic facial expressions .
McConnell “ was treating [ Kagan ] like she was a promising debutante , ” he said . “ And I rolled my eyes . And then I smirked . And then I laughed . ”
McConnell responded by telling Franken that the hearing was “ not ‘ Saturday Night Live . ' ” Franken said he immediately understood his mistake and sent a note of apology to McConnell 's office . The two made up and shared a friendly dinner .
“ Every once in a while , Mitch can be a mensch , ” Franken said . “ Although I 'm not sure he knows what that means . ”

As tempting as a free Target gift card might be , remember that when something sounds too good to be true , it usually is . So if you see anything about a free Target gift while browsing Facebook this week , you 'll want to remember just that . As Good Housekeeping reported , there is a Target gift card scam making its way around Facebook right now and here 's everything you need to know .
The scam is a Facebook post that has been going around , masquerading as an innocent offer of a free gift card . `` Howdy friends . Send TARGET to 83361 and get a free Target gift card . Just got one , '' reads one such caption , alongside a photo of a grocery haul , according to reports from Snopes and Good Housekeeping . Target did not immediately respond to Romper 's request for comment regarding the scam .
So if someone actually sends that text message , what will happen ? This scam is a `` smishing '' scam , as Good Housekeeping explained . And despite the silly name ( it 's a combination of SMS and phishing ) , smishing is actually quite serious .
After someone sends the text , the scammer will likely reply with a link , according to IDTheftInfo . The link will typically lead people to a page where they are prompted to type in personal information , like their credit card number or social security number .
After someone sends the initial text message , the scammer may have a variety of motives , as Jason Hong , a professor at Carnegie Mellon University told Fortune . They may be trying to hack into a person 's bank account , steal their identity , or blackmail them into sharing private information . For so long , scammers have conducted their work through email — so why the sudden shift to text message ? Hong explained to Fortune :
That 's where the money is ... People are getting more suspicious of emails . Companies like Google and Yahoo are getting better at detecting fake accounts and shutting them down . So the next easiest thing for [ a scammer ] to do is to go to mobile .
So how can people make sure not to fall victim to smishing scams like this one ? For one thing , if a link sent to you for a major store 's promotion does not bring you to the store 's official website , steer clear , as IDTheftInfo advised . Additionally — and this should really go without saying — your social security number , credit card number , and other private information would never need to be provided for any real free gift card contest . You should only ever enter private data on secure websites ( those with `` https '' in the URL ) .
Furthermore , try not to enter any contests that require you to provide your cell phone number , according to USA Today . And finally , when ( or if ) you look over your credit card statement and cell phone bill every month , look through each charge to make sure nothing seems fishy , USA Today added .
There is n't much information on exactly what the scammers behind this Target scam are after . Rather , the scammer ( s ) probably realized how much people love Target and decided to target Facebook users by dangling a Target gift card in front of them .
In fact , Target 's website has an entire page devoted to helping customers avoid gift card fraud . `` Do n't click on or respond to online ads or websites offering free gift cards . These are often scams , '' reads one piece of advice . Well , there it is straight from the source , folks . Really , the only way to get a free Target gift card is if a dear friend gives you one as a present — so if your birthday is sometime soon , now would be a great time to start dropping hints .
The North Carolina Courage are in first-place again , and five points clear of the nearest team after a 2-1 win over the Seattle Reign FC Sunday night . The Courage 's victory concluded a three-games-in-eight-days run with a full nine points taken from all games . The result dealt the Reign , who played without Megan Rapinoe , out recovering from knee surgery , and Jess Fishlock , their first home loss in 2017 and ended their 16-game unbeaten streak at Memorial Stadium .
Even First Half
Samantha Mewis put the Courage ahead with a wonderful display of power and finesse . The play began with a pass up the line by Jaelene Hinkle . Jess McDonald made the run outside to receive the ball and rounded on her defender , pushing her back and inside Seattle 's penalty box . She played a hard pass to the top of the 18 just behind Lynn Williams , who reached back to knock the ball into Sam Mewis ' path . Mewis took a half-step to gather herself before smacking a perfect volley for the game 's opening goal .

Seattle grabbed the equalizing goal just five minutes before halftime . After receiving the ball at midfield , Merritt Mathias powered up the right flank past Ashley Hatch and laid off a simple ball to Lindsay Elston on the sideline . Elston drilled a first-time cross that flew over the Courage back line and dropped perfectly at the top of the six-yard box , where an onrushing Rumi Utsugi arrived to bury it with a left-footed diving volley .
Rowland keeps Courage alive in second half
North Carolina 's most important player of the second half was goalkeeper Katelyn Rowland , who made two saves within five minutes to keep her team in the game . In the 65th minute , Rowland came bravely off her line to block a shot by Naho Kawasumi , and read the play well again three minutes later when she repelled a cross that deflected off Beverly Yanez at the last second .

Rowland 's confident handling kept the Courage alive for a game-winner against the run of play in the 74th minute . Hatch sent in a long throw-in that Mewis flicked back into the Seattle defense . Kristen McNabb had to react quickly and muffed the clearance , and for the second time that evening a rebound sat up perfectly for Sam Mewis , who made no mistake in bending the loose ball past a helpless Haley Kopmeyer .
Plenty of good for Seattle
Seattle pieced together several half chances in the final fifteen minutes , but they never recovered their earlier rhythm . The loss , Seattle 's first defeat at home in 2017 , drops the Reign two points behind the Orlando Pride and out of playoff position . With a match scheduled for Wednesday , August 16th , they 'll have a quick turnaround , but unfortunately the schedule points them due east to Toyota Park , Illinois , and the third-place Chicago Red Stars , another NWSL side with a near-impregnable home record .
There are plenty of positives the Reign can take from Sunday 's match . Despite missing their top goalscorer , Seattle created a lot of chances . Katie Johnson 's high press and speed were threatening up top , and her rotation with Kawasumi , Elston , Yanez , and Mathias caused the Courage backline plenty of problems .
After an exhausting eight-day schedule the Courage do n't play again until Saturday , when they host the Washington Spirit at 3:30 pm , a game that will be televised live on Lifetime .
MAPLE LEAFS AT PHILADELPHIA FLYERS
Tuesday , 7 p.m. Wells Fargo Center
TV : TSN4 RADIO : 590 AM
THE BIG MATCHUP
D Nikita Zaitsev vs , D Ivan Provorov
The pair of Russians are among the top 10 NHL defencemen in shot blocks ( Zaitsev tied for the league lead before Monday 's games ) and both will be called upon again tonight . Provorov was on the Maple Leafs ' radar in the 2015 draft had they opted for a defenceman and if Noah Hanifin was gone . Zaitsev is a key on the penalty kill as well and leads all Toronto blueliners in ice time .
FIVE KEYS TO THE GAME
Hakstol 's home hex
Before the Flyers went West , the edgy Philly fan base wanted coach Dave Hakstol 's head . Cue the sweep of Calgary , Edmonton , and Vancouver , with just five goals allowed , and he has a reprieve from the mob . But with a conference-worst four home victories , the Flyers will have to keep it going on Broad Street .
No red-light Fred
Frederik Andersen 's 4-2 loss to the Flyers at the ACC on Oct. 28 was his first in seven encounters against the black and orange , so that 's plenty of motivation for Toronto 's early season MVP . Brian Elliott was a catalyst for Philly on its road trip , in for all three wins and a .954 save percentage .
Naz-a-ma-taz
Two goals against the Flyers in the last meeting marked the sixth time Nazem Kadri has fallen a goal shy of an NHL hat trick . He 's doing a lot of other things right for the Leafs of late , but the road situation will make it harder for coach Mike Babcock to utilize him as a shutdown centre without last line change .
Raffl ticket
Austrian Michael Raffl has moved from the fourth line to an effective top-six winger , using size and speed to make things happen . That has been a big help to what was a critical deficit of secondary scoring for the Flyers .
Auston power
Auston Matthews is on the trip , but whether he 's well enough to play this game is unknown . If not , it would be the type of game that fourth-line winger Josh Leivo should be able to thrive in , never mind another chance at centre on the big line for William Nylander .
Better standards are in place in British Columbia , meaning less fish have escaped , reports show
The federal government is n't properly managing the risks that farmed salmon pose to their wild counterparts , nor is it doing enough to ensure Canada is meeting its international commitments on biodiversity and sustainable development , Canada 's environmental watchdog says .
In a series of new audits released Tuesday , environment commissioner Julie Gelfand takes a closer look at Canada 's management of the $ 1-billion salmon farming industry , which she warns is lacking when it comes to assessing the risk that diseases among farmed fish pose to wild salmon .
The department has no requirement to monitor the health of wild salmon or the status of the ocean floor beneath penned salmon farms , said Gelfand , and the department is also providing better funding for research related to fish farms than it is for research to help monitor their impact .
“ The department is at risk of being seen to promote aquaculture over the protection of wild salmon , ” Gelfand said after the reports were tabled in Parliament .
The research gaps are extensive enough that there 's no way to determine the impact of fish farms on wild fish , she said . Those gaps include a lack of knowledge about the risk of disease , as well as the impact of the drugs used to treat those diseases . Canada also lacks an impact threshold to determine when to shut down or limit fish farming , she added .
Canada also lacks standards for the nets used to contain farmed salmon in the ocean — a particular problem in the Atlantic , where heavy storms often batter salmon farms and destroy nets .

In 2015 , 40,000 salmon escaped from farms in Newfoundland and Labrador , New Brunswick and Nova Scotia . Better standards are in place in British Columbia , where fewer escapes have occurred , the report says .
Gelfand 's spring reports also look at Canada 's commitment to the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the UN Convention on Biological Diversity , both of which , she warns , could become the latest international environment agreements Canada signs but does little to actually implement .
She cited a lack of government leadership to address the targets in those agreements , saying there is no way to properly assess how effectively government policies can contribute to meeting those goals .
The agenda for sustainable development is an international agreement for countries to work towards sustainable environmental , economic and social development , including gender equality , eliminating poverty , climate action and industrial innovation .
Canada committed to the 2030 agenda in 2015 and recommitted to it last year , but the audit says the government has n't yet put in place the fundamental requirements to do more than pay it lip service .
“ The federal government committed to implementing the 2030 agenda three years ago , but again , it is not ready to respect its international commitment , ” Gelfand said . “ When will it be ready ? ”
The audit report looked at the period between September 2015 and November 2017 . The federal budget tabled in February promised nearly $ 50 million between now and 2030 to create a specific government unit to oversee the agenda , as well as to fund monitoring and reporting by Statistics Canada , Gelfand acknowledged .
The statistics agency also expects this spring to have a data portal ready to report on the Canadian indicators around the UN 2030 agenda . That could address one of Gelfand 's concerns that there are too many departments assigned as co-leads on the agenda , leaving no one to take full ownership of or leadership on the file .
“ In my opinion , it is difficult to move forward with 10 hands on the wheel , ” she says .
Gelfand 's third audit this spring looked at another unmet Canadian UN environment commitment , this one the UN Convention on Biological Diversity — a legally binding treaty acknowledging that a global decline in biodiversity is one of the “ most serious issues facing humanity . ”
Canada has had a biodiversity strategy under the convention since 1995 ; in 2002 , signatories committed to reducing the rate of biodiversity loss by 2010 . New targets were set for 2020 after that original deadline went wanting .
Environment Canada is n't taking the necessary steps to hit the 2020 targets , Gelfand found , focusing its efforts on international meetings and creating national committees rather than analyzing whether its actions will do anything to help . There is also no comprehensive monitoring or reporting on whether there is any progress to meeting the 2020 targets .

KUALA LUMPUR ( Reuters ) - Malaysia 's former prime minister , Najib Razak , on Wednesday pleaded not guilty to abuse of power and other charges arising from an investigation into a scandal-plagued state fund , weeks after he was ousted in a stunning election defeat .
Najib , 64 , who has denied wrongdoing in relation to the 1Malaysia Development Berhad ( 1MDB ) fund he founded , was charged with abuse of power and three counts of criminal breach of trust as part of an investigation into a transaction involving its former unit SRC International .
The charges relate to some 42 million ringgits ( $ 10.4 million ) of funds that allegedly went from SRC into Najib 's personal bank account . This represents a small fraction of the billions of dollars the U.S. Department of Justice has said was misappropriated from 1MDB .
Malaysia 's attorney general said he expected more reports from the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission ( MACC ) investigating wrongdoing at the fund .
“ This is arising from the first MACC IP ( investigation papers ) given to my office three weeks ago . No doubt there will be more , ” Tommy Thomas , who is leading the case against Najib , told reporters outside the court .
In a pre-recorded message posted on Twitter after his arrest , Najib said he was not perfect and “ not all the accusations against me and my family are true .
“ Let investigations be carried out . I have not had a chance to defend myself , ” he said .
Each of the four charges against Najib carries a prison term of up to 20 years . The abuse of power charge carries a fine of not less than five times the “ value of gratification ” .
Najib was granted bail of 1 million ringgits ( $ 247,000 ) and was ordered to surrender his passports . The judge set a tentative date for the trial to begin of Feb. 18 , 2019 .
The son of a former prime minister , Najib joined parliament at the age of 23 and rose through the ranks to take the top job in 2009 . But his second term in office from 2013 was plagued by allegations around 1MDB , prompting a stunning fall from grace that culminated in his arrest on Tuesday .

Mahathir Mohamad , who helped Najib 's political ascent before turning on him as the allegations surfaced , led a campaign that unseated Najib in a May 9 election and ousted a coalition that had ruled since Malaysia 's independence from Britain in 1957 .
One of Mahathir 's first acts was to reopen the 1MDB investigation .
SUPPORTERS GATHER
After spending the night in detention , Najib arrived at the court in the capital Kuala Lumpur on Wednesday wearing a dark blue suit and a red tie .
Crowds of media and onlookers jostled to catch a glance of the former premier . Some supporters of Najib 's UMNO party chanted and held up placards in support of him .
Soon after coming into power in 2009 , Najib founded 1MDB . The fund is being investigated in at least six countries on suspicion of money laundering .
SRC , created in 2011 by Najib 's government to pursue overseas investment in energy resources , was a unit of 1MDB until it was moved to the finance ministry in 2012 .
SRC has been the initial focus of Malaysian investigators as all the suspicious transactions involving the firm were made through Malaysian entities , unlike other 1MDB related transactions that went through foreign banks and companies .
A spokesman for Najib said on Tuesday that the SRC charges and the 1MDB investigations were “ politically motivated ” , and Najib will contest the charges and clear his name in court .
Mahathir told Reuters last month that embezzlement and bribery using government money were among the charges being considered against Najib , adding that his former protege was fully responsible for the 1MDB scandal .
Since his election loss , Najib has been barred from leaving the country and investigators have seized luxury handbags , jewellery and other items worth millions of dollars from properties linked to his family .

One of the biggest contributors to ocean pollution may be hanging in your closet right now . That would be microfibers , infinitesimal strands of polyester found in the ubiquitous fleece jackets we all know and love .
A type of microplastic — similar to the vilified and widely banned microbeads — microfibers are potentially more problematic for the ocean and other waterways . Not only are they denser , able to sink while microbeads and other plastics float ; microfibers can pass through nets and filtration systems that catch larger plastic pollutants . And , as with other microplastics , they are commonly mistaken for food by myriad marine life , disrupting feeding and digestion .
In short , microfibers are big problems .
While industrial ecologist Roland Geyer , of UCSB 's Bren School of Environmental Science & Management , works to quantify the amount of all plastics entering our oceans , some Bren School students have made strides in painting a clearer picture of microfiber pollution in particular .
Recognizing the challenges posed by microfiber , and seeking broader edification as a step toward solutions , apparel-maker Patagonia turned to Bren School . The company partnered with a team of graduate researchers to investigate and elucidate the issue .
Guided by advisor and Bren School professor Patricia Holden , students Nicholas Bruce , Niko Hartline , Stephanie Karba , Bess Ruff and Shreya Sonar collaborated with Patagonia to develop a protocol the apparel industry can use to better understand microfiber pollution and its impacts , and establish steps to mitigate it .
Working at Patagonia headquarters in Ventura and at the Bren School , the students employed filters to capture and quantify fibers from machines used to wash polyester-based garments . They then undertook a series of tests . Among their results : Top-loading washers cause more shedding than front loaders ; aged jackets shed more than new ones ; and high-end jackets shed less than the budget variety they tested . The work was published in the journal Environmental Science & Technology .
“ We found , by our estimates , that around 100,000 of these fibers can be released from a single jacket in each wash , ” said Hartline , first author on the paper . “ Other studies are coming out with larger numbers , so there is a huge range in what people have been finding . But 100,000 was consistent across the jackets that we washed — and that was quite a bit more than what was found previously .
“ The unique impact that microplastics have as a pollutant is their access to the lowest trophic levels of the ocean and water bodies in general — filter feeders of all sorts are getting these things lodged in their gut , ” Hartline added . “ From there what it does is questionable … The focus will likely move toward quantifying or at least describing the impact that microplastics have in the environment . We will probably see more of that research surface in the coming years . ”
Hartline and his co-researchers suggested future studies could examine how washwater temperature , wash-cycle length , clothing construction and detergent type may affect fiber shedding .
Meanwhile , Holden sees parallels to other areas of research , and ways forward to manage the problem . “ Synthetic microfibers , like engineered nanomaterials , are being emitted from consumer goods into waste streams , ” she said . “ When textiles have embedded nanomaterials , they go with the fibers . Improving removal in waste treatment systems could be an important path forward to address both concerns . ”
Alek Minassian was a member of the forces from Aug. 23 , 2017 until Oct. 25
Officials say the man accused in a van attack that left 10 people dead in Toronto on Monday was a member of the Canadian Armed Forces for two months last year .
A spokeswoman with the Department of National Defence says Alek Minassian was a member of the forces from Aug. 23 , 2017 until Oct. 25 .
She says Minassian did not complete his recruit training and asked to be voluntarily released after 16 days .

LONDON : Euro zone stocks opened 2017 by climbing to their highest in more than a year on Monday after data showed manufacturers in the currency bloc ramped up activity at the fastest pace in more than five years .
With all of Asia 's major markets closed for the New Year holiday - along with Britain and Switzerland in Europe - trade was thin , which could cause some volatility . The United States and Canada will also be closed .
The euro zone 's blue-chip Euro STOXX 50 index rose half a percent to its highest since December 2015 after the purchasing managers ' index ( PMI ) for factories in the currency bloc came in at 54.9 - well above the 50 mark that separates growth from contraction .
The euro , though , took no comfort from the figures , slipping 0.4 percent back below US $ 1.05 after climbing to as high as US $ 1.07 during a flash surge in low trading volumes in Asia on Friday .
Analysts said the fall was mainly due to a resumption of an up-trend in the greenback that saw it surge to 14-year highs in December on the view the U.S. Federal Reserve will hike rates as many as three times this year , and that Donald Trump 's administration will stoke growth and inflation with a program of fiscal expansion .
The dollar index - which measures the greenback against six major rivals - climbed half a percent , having hit a two-week low on Friday .
`` In the last days of 2016 we saw the dollar retreat somewhat , and there might be some sense of a correction from Europe this morning . I do n't see any fundamental drivers for the moves , '' said Commerzbank currency strategist Esther Reichelt , in Frankfurt .
Italy 's top share index hit its highest level since January last year , outperforming other major European stock indexes , with a rally in its banks and a strong manufacturing report improving sentiment .
Italy 's FTSE MIB index was up 1.5 percent by 1215 GMT at its highest level since January 15 of 2016 . Germany 's DAX was up 0.9 percent at its highest in nearly 17 months , while France 's CAC was up 0.5 percent at a 13-month peak .
As European stocks climbed , a rally in risk appetite also pushed down the yields on lower-rated government bonds in the euro zone to multi-week lows . Italian , Spanish and Portuguese 10-year bond yields were down roughly 8 basis points each on the day .
ISLAMIC STATE ATTACKS
A gun attack in Istanbul that killed 39 people was seen having little impact on markets , with the Japanese yen - traditionally used as a safe haven - falling 0.3 against the dollar , close to an 11-month low .
Islamic State claimed responsibility on Monday for the New Year 's Day mass shooting , which was carried out by a lone gunman in a packed nightclub in the Turkish city .
A separate Islamic State attack in Baghdad killed 24 people on Monday .
`` After all the big political shocks last year and muted market reaction , it is tempting to argue that the markets are very resilient , '' said Finland-based Nordea chief market strategist Jan Von Gerich .
`` I would say this is too optimistic an assumption and I think we will see more volatility this year . ''
The Turkish lira slipped half a percent after the attack to 3.5440 per dollar , close to a record low of 3.5840 the lira touched in December .
`` The problem is that this once again stresses the increasing instability and the security issues , and we 're seeing tourist numbers going down , which will have a lasting negative impact on the Turkish economy ... and that 's Turkish lira-negative , '' said Commerzbank 's Reichelt .
Data released earlier in the day showed China 's manufacturing sector expanded for a fifth month in December , though growth slowed a touch more than expected in a sign that government measures to rein in soaring asset prices are starting to have a knock-on effect on the broader economy .
The Chinese yuan suffered its biggest annual loss in more than 20 years in 2016 , with an almost 7 percent fall making it the worst-performing currency in Asia .
Digital currency bitcoin started the year by jumping above US $ 1,000 for the first time since late 2013 .

Thanks to a group of hardworking students who survived the Parkland shooting last month , numerous advocates of gun safety will march in the March For Our Lives this coming Saturday , March 24 . The march will be headquartered in Washington , D.C. , and there will be satellite marches in other cities all across the United States , as well as internationally . And with the rally just a few days away , residents of Arizona are likely wondering : Is there a March for Our Lives in Phoenix ?
Like many other cities , yes , Phoenix will be hosting a march as part of the March For Our Lives on March 24 . In fact , the city 's sister march is being organized entirely by Arizona teenagers , according to The Arizona Republic . The group of students helming the event made a Facebook page for the Phoenix chapter of the march , and as of Monday , more than 4,400 people are `` going , '' and more than 9,200 people are `` interested . '' The march will kick off Saturday at 10:00 a.m. at the Arizona State Capitol , located at 1700 West Washington Street in Phoenix .
`` On March 24 , kids and families will take to the streets to demand that their lives and safety become a priority and that we end gun violence and mass shootings in our schools today , '' reads a statement on the Arizona march 's website . `` On March 24 , the collective voices of the March For Our Lives movement will be heard . ''
The website also notes that the Phoenix march is led entirely by students , explaining :
Phoenix March For Our Lives is an entire youth led movement . There is not a single person on the planning committee over the age of 18 , in fact . Therefore , we are actively looking to recruit new youth organizers , whether in HS or College , to push for change .
The statement is followed by links for youths to volunteer . They can help by registering voters , publicizing the march , scheduling meetings with lawmakers , and more . Additionally , the website is selling Phoenix March For Our Lives merchandise , which will also be available to purchase at the march .
Samantha Lekberg , 16 , is one of the Arizona students helping to organize the march . `` I ca n't help but to see me and my classmates in them , '' Lekberg told The Arizona Republic , in reference to the survivors of the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting . `` I see my best friends in the victims and I see my family in theirs . ''
Lekberg also told the outlet :
I think it has to do with the fact that we are at the same stage in our lives . We deal with the same things on a daily basis ... So young people , now more than ever , understand the issue that 's going on because we are the targets . We are forced to quit being so naive when things like this happen .
Jordan Harb , 17 , is another teen activist helping to plan the march . He told told The Arizona Republic :
We all give our thoughts and prayers , but none of them are taking action ... It humbles me to see such a huge national movement . People , especially the youth , are sick of seeing shootings regularly . When mass death becomes the status quo , something has gone very wrong .
The March For Our Lives was first conceived in response to the tragic Feb. 14 , 2018 mass shooting in Parkland , Florida , which left 17 innocent students and teachers dead . According to the mission statement on the central March For Our Lives website , the aim of the march is `` to demand that a comprehensive and effective bill be immediately brought before Congress to address these gun issues . '' With so many people all across the country planning to participate , it 's a good time to be hopeful that Congress actually will address these important issues soon .

Right off the top , we need to make it very clear that this may not mean anything , but at the same time , this could also potentially be something for Star Wars fans to get excited about . But only maybe . Recently , an IMDB page for the proposed Star Wars : Underworld TV show wound up on Reddit and interestingly enough , it actually lists a premiere date for the series . So , is Lucasfilm actually planning on bringing Star Wars : Underworld to the small screen in 2018 ?
As many Star Wars fans may know , Star Wars : Underworld , a live-action series that would have taken place between the events of Star Wars : Revenge of the Sith and Star Wars : A New Hope , was originally conceived back in 2005 by George Lucas . But , the series was ultimately shelved for budgetary reasons . Now , the IMDB page for the series has a premiere date listed as December 15 , 2018 . On the one hand , this could mean absolutely nothing and could just be something that Disney and Lucasfilm have n't felt the need to edit or have taken down . On the other hand , it could mean that Star Wars : Underworld has been revived and is going to premiere next year . That is far more unlikely , but something that Star Wars fans would surely love to hear .
There is a lot to dig into here , but the most important thing to remember is that Disney and Lucasfilm tend to be very good at keeping things locked down with their announcements and official plans , so this is probably nothing . But , it is possible , however unlikely that Star Wars : Underworld is going to be the next big undertaking in a galaxy far , far away . For what it 's worth , Daniel Logan , who played a young Boba Fett in Star Wars : Attack of the Clones and voiced the character in episodes of Star Wars : The Clone Wars is listed for the series , and that fits the description currently provided for the show .
`` Follows the journeys of a young bounty hunter and his mentor , as they transport shipment around the galaxy , encountering huge threats along the way . ''
A live-action Star Wars show is something that has been talked about for a very long time , but for right now , or at least as far as we know and have heard , it is not part of Lucasfilm 's plan in the near future . That said , George Lucas originally commissioned a ton of writers to generate scripts for Star Wars : Underworld and when Disney purchased Lucasfilm , they got those scripts , of which there are reportedly 100 . So , they may be wanting to make use of some of that content . For what it 's worth , here is how Lucas described the show in an interview with Total Film Magazine back in 2008 .
`` It 's kind of like Episode IV , it 's funny and there 's action , but it 's [ a ] lot more talky . It 's more of what I would call a soap opera with a bunch of personal dramas in it . It 's not really based on action-adventure films from the '30s , it 's actually more based on film noir movies from the '40s ! ''
The other thing worth noting is that , there is nothing that says Star Wars : Underworld would have to be done as a live-action show . There have been some rumors swirling that Star Wars Rebels is going to end after season 3 , which concludes in March . There has also been evidence that suggests Lucasfilm could be looking to announce a new animated series , probably at Star Wars Celebration in April either to bolster their roster or take the place of Star Wars Rebels next year . It is a possibility that the new animated series could be Star Wars : Underworld .
For right now , given that all we have to go on is an IMDB page with a premiere date listed , it is n't worth getting your hopes up about a potential Star Wars : Underworld series . That said , the fact that this page is still up and has n't been edited or taken down by Lucasfilm is something worth chewing on . Who 's to say we are n't going to get an announcement about Star Wars : Underworld at Star Wars Celebration this year ?
The only potential issue is that , if the series were to premiere in December , that would possibly take some steam away on the movie side of things . As of right now , the young Han Solo movie is scheduled to be released in May of 2018 , but it is highly speculated that , given the success of both Star Wars : The Force Awakens and Rogue One : A Star Wars Story , Disney will move it to December . If they stick to their guns and keep Han Solo in May , that would actually lend a lot more credibility to the idea that Star Wars : Underworld could make it to air next December . We 'll have to wait and see , but the prospect of this show , no matter how small , is exciting .
SEOUL : South Korea 's prime minister will preside over a national security council meeting on Wednesday ( Feb 15 ) morning to discuss the suspected murder of the North Korean leader 's estranged half-brother in Malaysia , his office said .
Kim Jong Nam , the half-brother of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un , was found dead in Malaysia , according to Malaysian police on Tuesday . U.S. government sources have told Reuters they believe he had been murdered by North Korean agents .
A South Korean official also said they believed he had been murdered , without giving further details .
Kim Jong Nam , who was estranged from young North Korean leader Kim Jong-un , was known to spend a significant amount of his time outside North Korea and had spoken out publicly against his family 's dynastic control of the isolated state .
South Korea is acutely sensitive to any sign of potential instability in its impoverished and nuclear-armed neighbour , with which it remains technically in a state of war .
Malaysian police said the dead man , 46 , held a passport under the name Kim Chol . Kim Jong Nam has been caught in the past using forged travel documents .
Malaysian police official Fadzil Ahmat said on Tuesday the cause of Kim 's death was not yet known , and that a post-mortem would be carried out . Kim had been planning to travel to Macau on Monday when he fell ill at the low-cost terminal of Kuala Lumpur International Airport ( KLIA ) , Fadzil said .
The U.S. government sources said it was possible that Kim Jong Nam had been poisoned .

Broken hearts can be mended using an injectable tissue repair patch smaller than a postage stamp , research has shown .
The AngioChip consists of a biodegradable scaffold seeded with lab-grown heart cells and blood vessels .
Once injected into an ailing heart , shape-memory technology causes it to unfold into an expanding `` bandage '' . Over time the scaffold breaks down , leaving behind the new growing tissue .
Tests have shown that injecting the patch into rats that have suffered heart attacks improves the animals ' cardiac function .
Damaged ventricles pumped out more blood than they did without the patch .
Lead researcher Professor Milica Radisic , from the University of Toronto in Canada , said : `` It ca n't restore the heart back to full health but if it could be done in a human we think it would significantly improve quality of life . ''
An implant requiring open-heart surgery it is not going to be widely available to patients , Prof Radisic explained .
The alternative , an injected patch , was developed over a period of nearly three years .
After a large number of failures , the scientists came up with a design based on physical rather than chemical shape-memory properties .
This meant the unfolding process did not require additional injections and would not be affected by conditions within the body .
Injecting the patch into rats and pigs confirmed the heart cells survived the procedure well , the researchers reported in the journal Nature Materials .
Miles Montgomery , a PhD student in Prof Radisic 's laboratory , said : `` When we saw that the lab-grown cardiac tissue was functional and not affected by the injection process , that was very exciting .
`` Heart cells are extremely sensitive , so if we can do it with them , we can likely do it with other tissues as well . ''
The team is investigating whether the patch can be improved or used to repair other organs such as the liver .
Prof Radisic , who points out the invention is still a long way from being tested on patients , added : `` You could customise this platform , adding growth factors or other drugs that would encourage tissue regeneration . ''

CPI ( M ) general secretary Sitaram Yechury on Wednesday hailed the Supreme Court order on the power tussle between the AAP government and the Centre and said it brought into sharp focus the role of L-Gs and Governors and the misuse of power by them. “ BJP 's charade of cooperative federalism and in reality destroying our federal structure is condemnable . LGs/Governors can not usurp rights of an elected state government , ” he said in a tweet.The CPI echoed the sentiment and said the verdict was applicable to all the states , with its leader D Raja saying it is very clear that elected representatives can not be ignored as they represent the people.Raja was hinting towards the turf war in Puducherry , where CM Narayanasamy , who is engaged in a long running feud with L-G Kiran Bedi , has already said that the Delhi verdict is “ totally applicable ” in the union territory.But the apex court has clarified that Puducherry can not be compared with the case of Delhi as it is governed by a provision which is different from that concerning the national capital . It said that Puducherry was covered under Article 239A whereas NCT of Delhi is covered under Article 239AA.The Supreme Court handed a major victory to Delhi 's AAP government in its bitter power tussle by ruling that the Lieutenant Governor ( LG ) has no independent power to take decisions and is bound by the elected government 's advice.Meanwhile , Yechury also wrote to the law commission , voicing his opposition to the idea of holding Lok Sabha and Assembly polls simultaneously , saying that it is inherently `` anti-democratic '' and negates the principles of federalism , which is a fundamental feature of Constitution.The panel had on June 14 written to all recognised political parties seeking their views on the issue . In his letter , Yechury listed the party 's objections to the proposal stating that it goes beyond the ambit of law reform entailing major amendments to Constitution , and would run against both the `` letter and spirit of our Constitution '' . `` The aspects of our Constitution , we believe , can not be undermined , or tweaked . We believe that such a proposal is inherently anti-democratic and negates the principles of federalism which is a fundamental feature of our Constitution , '' he wrote.The Law Commission will hold a two-day consultation with major political parties in New Delhi this week on the possibility of holding Lok Sabha and Assembly polls together . Yechury had thanked the panel for inviting his party to the consultation , but said that it `` may not be necessary '' that they would attend .
Alysia Reiner , who 's back on “ Orange Is the New Black ” as tough prison exec Natalie Figueroa , tells us she feels the show 's especially important , “ considering what 's going on in our political structure today . ”
She added , “ The business of prison really turns my stomach because I am in the business of believing in the human spirit and rehabilitating people . . . If you 're gon na put someone in that situation , why not create a situation where they can better themselves as opposed to just making money for the man ? ”
WASHINGTON : The US Federal Reserve raised its benchmark interest rate by a quarter point to 1.0-1.25 % on Wednesday ( Jun 14 ) and signalled another increase remains likely this year , despite the recent spate of weak economic data .
In explaining this second rate hike of 2017 and plans for more increases in the coming months , Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen said the move reflected the progress in the world 's largest economy , which continues to add jobs at a solid pace .
`` The economy is doing well , is showing resilience , '' Yellen said in her quarterly press conference .
`` We have a very strong labour market , an unemployment rate that 's declined to levels we have not seen since 2001 . And even with some moderation in the pace of job growth , we have a labour market that continues to strengthen . ''
And despite recent tepid price pressures , the Fed expects inflation to pick up - eventually , citing `` one-off reductions '' in certain categories such as cell phone services and prescription drugs as the reason for the recent lower readings .

Those factors mean the Fed 's preferred inflation measure will remain below the two per cent target for some time , but will gradually rise to the target level over `` the medium term . ''
But coming on a day when the consumer price index and retail sales fell , in large part due to falling food and gasoline prices , but with widespread declines in other categories , some economists are saying the Fed is no longer basing its decision on the data , as it has repeatedly said .
`` The third rate hike in seven months , coming not long after a relatively poor Q1 GDP print , suggests the Fed has become less data-dependent in its monetary policy decisions , '' Fitch Ratings Chief Economist Brian Coulton said .
One FOMC member , Minneapolis Federal Reserve Bank President Neel Kashkari , dissented from the decision , preferring to keep policy on hold for now .
THIRD HIKE COMING ?
sentifi.com Channel News Asia - Sentifi topic widget
Analysts in recent weeks have become increasingly doubtful there would be a third rate increase later this year , as inflation , consumption and other economic data have indicated the weakness seen in the first quarter has continued .
Fed futures markets now put the chances for another rate increase this year to below 50 per cent .
Chris Low of FTN Financial said the Fed `` compromised '' by continuing the rate increases despite falling inflation , but `` the market expects the Fed to take a break . ''
However , Yellen said business and household confidence remain quite strong , and echoed the statement from the Fed 's policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee , which repeated its confidence that the economy will continue to expand `` at a moderate pace '' even with further gradual rate increases .
Asked about the criticism , Yellen said , `` I do n't think ... the Fed 's credibility has been impaired . ''
She once again said the path of interest rates `` is not a pre-set course , '' but the Fed 's quarterly projections show they still anticipate making a third rate increase this year , with the median federal funds rate ending 2017 at 1.4 per cent .
That would be followed by three rate increases in 2018 and three more in 2019 , with the key rate at 2.9 per cent by the end of that period .
FORECASTS
In their quarterly projections , Fed officials saw the economy growing slightly faster than previously forecast , with GDP up 2.2 per cent this year , a tenth of a percentage point higher than forecast in March .
But the estimate for the central bank 's preferred measure of inflation , the PCE price index , was cut three-tenths to 1.6 per cent , while the core PCE , which excludes volatile food and energy prices , was cut two-tenths to 1.7 per cent , according to the Summary of Economic Projections .
The Fed now sees the unemployment rate ending the year at 4.3 per cent , where it sits currently , rather than the 4.5 per cent previously expected .
The central bank also confirmed that it will begin later this year to implement a plan to reduce the size of its investment holdings , which were built up to record levels during the financial crisis to help support the economy , especially once interest rates reached zero .
As long as the economy `` evolves broadly as expected , '' the plan `` would gradually reduce the Federal Reserve 's securities holdings , '' the FOMC statement said .
GUATEMALA CITY : A strong 6.9 magnitude earthquake hit western Guatemala early on Wednesday ( Jun 14 ) , killing five people , causing power outages and knocking down homes , officials said .
The quake , originally estimated to measure 6.6 on the Richter scale before being revised upward , occurred at 1.29am ( 3.29pm Singapore time ) .
The epicentre of the quake was about 156 kilometres west of Guatemala City in the department of San Marcos , the Institute of Seismology said .
After reports of two deaths initially , three more people died of heart attacks sustained during the quake .
A man was killed in the southwestern Guatemalan village of San Sebastian after an old church collapsed , the agency said . News reports said another victim , a woman , died of a heart attack in a small village near the border with Mexico .

The tremor was felt across most of the country , including the capital , as well as in neighbouring Mexico , according to Guatemala 's National Coordinator for Disaster Reduction .
`` Moderate damage is reported to houses in southwestern areas and there are power outages in several parts of the country , '' agency spokesman Julio Sanchez said , adding that a 5.6-magnitude aftershock hit across the border in Mexico minutes after the first quake .
The quake , originally estimated to measure 6.6 on the Richter scale before being revised upward , epicentred 156 kilometres west of Guatemala City in the department of San Marcos , the Institute of Seismology said .
In the southeastern Mexican state of Chiapas , 11 people were treated for injuries . Twenty houses and five schools were damaged , state officials said . Video footage aired by rescue teams showed collapsed homes in western Guatemala , especially ones made of mud and straw in this poor Central American country .
President Jimmy Morales posted a message on Twitter , saying `` stay calm and be alert to possible aftershocks '' .
Guatemala is in a risk zone for tremors , located where the Caribbean Cocos tectonic plates converge with North America 's tectonic plates .
San Marcos was hit by earthquakes in 2012 and 2014 that left dozens dead .
Kolkata : Amid much fanfare and tight security , Argentine football legend Diego Maradona reached the city for a three-day visit on Sunday .
The iconic player , who is now coach of the Dubai-based club Al-Fujairah SC , was seen waving at fans before getting into the car , flashing the 'victory ' sign at camerapersons and supporters and throwing flying kisses .

Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath has maintained that 63 children in government-run Gorakhpur hospital died because of their ailments and not oxygen shortage , but grieving parents say their children were fine till the oxygen supply was cut.Some like Mohd Zahid , father of a five-year-old , alleged that BRD hospital authorities refused to declare their children dead , even as their bodies had turned ice cold as this would have further taken up the death toll.Another father said that while his son started bleeding from the nose , the hospital staff dismissed it saying , “ Kachra nikal raha hai ” ( It 's just body waste that is coming out ) .In a harrowing tragedy exposing the sorry state of medical facilities in Uttar Pradesh , at least 32 children perished between August 10 and 11 , allegedly due to no oxygen supply . A total of 63 children died within a span of five days , even as different ministers here could be seen making repeated tours of the BRD Medical College and passing the buck.The chief minister even dubbed the claim of oxygen shortage as fake news . Health Minister Sidharth Nath Singh attributed various other reasons to the tragedy . Yet , nothing can be done to ease the pain of these families.Zahid , who lives 7 kms from the Gorakhpur hospital , would have liked his daughter Khushi to become a doctor.Khushi was diagnosed with encephalitis and admitted to the hospital on August 10 . Shreya DhoundialKhushi was diagnosed with encephalitis and admitted on August 10 . While she was put on oxygen support on Thursday , hours later the supply was pulled out without any explanation . The family was handed an Ambu pump and asked to keep pumping to keep their child alive.Zahid insists his daughter was doing fine until the oxygen supply was cut and her health started deteriorating soon after.Mohd Zahid shows a photograph of Khushi . Shreya Dhoundial “ The government is lying to cover up their mistake , ” he says . “ If there was enough oxygen , why was the mask removed ? I have lost my daughter why would I lie ? ” The hospital , however , did not stop at that . Zahid says the doctors refused to declare Khushi dead for another four hours to keep the rising death toll under the wraps. “ My daughter died at 6pm and I know that because her entire body had turned cold . But the doctors kept insisting that she was alive because mediapersons were waiting outside . They kept injecting needles into my dead child just to show that she was alive , ” Zahid narrates.Khushi was finally declared dead at 10pm . Zahid , who had once hoped that his daughter would study at the BRD Medical College someday , now calls it a slaughterhouse.While Zahid was still nursing his child , 40 kms away , Srikusun Gupta was worried about one of his twin boys , who was detected with an irregular heartbeat and taken to a private clinic . The clinic referred the five-day-old to BRD Medical College because they did n't have a spare ventilator.The five-day-old boy was detected with irregular heartbeat and admitted to the government hospital , they were told that there was no ventilator that can be provided . Shreya DhoundialWhat they saw at the hospital 's neonatal ward on August 11 shocked them . “ Four babies died in front of us while we were still settling down . And they kept dying all around us till the time we were there , '' Gupta says.While Gupta 's boy was admitted in ICU , there was no ventilator or oxygen available . For four hours , Gupta kept pumping an Ambu pump in the hope that a ventilator or an oxygen machine would be provided to them . Two others parents were doing the same to their babies on the same bed. “ Each time I asked , I was told there are no arrangements right now , ” he adds.Gupta is angry that the doctors refused to communicate with the families , fending them off every time someone approached the staff. “ When blood started coming out of my child 's nose they said 'kachra ' nikal raha hai . How is my child 's blood kachra ? ” He rubbishes the government 's claims that not a single child has died due to lack of oxygen.In Beriapar , Ramesh Yadav has n't spoken to anyone in the last 72 hours . His 12-year-old daughter Vandana died at the ICU of the BRD Medical College on the morning of August 11 , 10 hours after she was admitted with fever.Vandana died 10 hours after being admitted to the BRD Hospital . They were handed an Ambu pump for oxygen supply . Shreya DhoundialHer uncle , Umesh Yadav , was handed an Ambu pump when he asked the doctors for oxygen . He was told there is a technical problem . `` What does the government know about how things were inside the ward ? Where were they ? I was there and I can tell you the situation was very bad , '' Yadav demands.Ramesh Yadav , Vandana 's father has n't spoken to anyone in the last 72 hours . Shreya DhoundialAlong with Vandana 's body , the family was also given a stern warning — “ Leave through the backdoor and do n't speak to the media . ”
“ We 've received messages about these kinds of packages , ” he revealed in an interview with Aamulehti on Sunday .
Jari Lindström ( BR ) , the Minister of Employment , has expressed his concern about reports that employers have begun offering tailor-made packages to help unemployed job seekers to satisfy the activity criteria laid out in the activation model for unemployment security .
“ Employers are offering the unemployed this kind of tailored packages , which are used to satisfy the activity criteria but that do n't really promote activity . This was certainly not the objective , certainly not , ” said Lindström .
He admitted that the much-discussed activation model is not without its problems but added that the model has been largely received well by the Employment and Economic Development Offices ( TE Offices ) . “ They 've told that it 's becoming clear that people who have n't shown any interest [ in working ] for years are becoming more active , ” he revealed .
The Finnish government has begun drafting revisions to address the problems in the activation model , but introducing them will likely take a while longer as the twists and turns of the social , health care and regional government reform are affecting all parliamentary decision making , according to Lindström .

PanARMENIAN.Net - Russian prime minister Dmitry Medvedev believes that member-states of the Eurasian Economic Union ( EAEU ) ( Armenia , Belarus , Kazakhstan , Kyrgyzstan and Russia ) should make a gradual transition to marking of all goods , TASS reports .
`` We will sign an agreement on goods marking today , which is called to improve control over the turnover of goods in the territory of the Union . Traceability will make it possible to significantly improve operations of the common market , increase the collection of taxes and bring the whole sectors of the retail trade out of the shadows , '' Medvedev said on Friday , February 2 .
`` It is important to extend marking to new groups of goods step-by-step until all commercial products are covered , '' he said , addressing the Eurasian Intergovernmental Council in Almaty .
`` The work should be complemented with new initiatives . The need is imminent to go deeper in other topics - nuclear energy , research and technology cooperation , healthcare , environmental protection , tourism and sports . ''
Medvedev also spoke in favor of more active development of cooperation between the countries of the EAEU in the digital sphere , noting resolving information security issues as one of priorities .
`` Undoubtedly , the digital agenda breaks the usual boundaries and creates a common digital space . The question is how quickly it will move forward , how close our interaction will be , how much we will be able to adapt to those trends that are gaining momentum on our planet , '' Medvedev said .
He spoke about multi-platforms Alibaba and Amazon as an example . `` Indeed , they accumulate a significant amount of information about consumers , about markets , about purchases and use all this in their commercial interests , so we really need to move faster , '' Medvedev said .
Medvedev noted that coordination of efforts in this sphere would be discussed at the upcoming meeting of heads of government of the EAEU countries on Friday . `` It is obvious that we can not do this alone . We will need to unite our markets - commodity , human , logistics , technological and form our own infrastructure , '' Medvedev said .

HAMBURG ( Reuters ) - A German university teaching hospital that has been caught up in an outcry over testing the impact of nitrogen dioxide on humans said on Friday there was no danger to the people involved .
Aachen University 's teaching hospital became embroiled in the saga after a German newspaper reported German carmarkers had sponsored scientific experiments testing nitrogen dioxide , a gas found in exhaust fumes , on the people .
The study was promoted by the European Research Group on Environment and Health in the Transport Sector ( EUGT ) , Stuttgarter Zeitung said .
The New York Times reported last month that Volkswagen ( VOWG_p.DE ) , BMW and Daimler had also funded EUGT to commission separate tests on monkeys , which the Aachen team was not involved with .
Reuters could not confirm the details and purpose of the monkey study and EUGT , which was dissolved last year , could not be reached for comment .
Volkswagen , Daimler and BMW denounced the monkey study , the revelation of which is the latest aftershock from the VW emissions-rigging scandal , which continues to rock the auto industry .
The university team had already confirmed on Monday that EUGT had sponsored their human study in 2013 and 2014 but said it was related to workplace safety , not diesel emissions .

RWTH Aachen will pay more attention to the source of funding for such studies in the future , the university told a news conference on Friday .
As part of the study , 25 people were exposed to varying levels of nitrogen dioxide for three hours to investigate the possible health effects of the chemical compound in concentrations below the limit for workplaces , RWTH Aachen said its statement on Monday .
“ The concentration of nitrogen oxide had been very low , not to harm the people being tested . We used very sensitive devices to detect possible respiratory reactions , ” Thomas Kraus , director of the institute , told the news conference on Friday .
“ These are reactions of the immune system which can be measured with sensitive methodology , but which are far from a danger to a subject , because they are very quickly reversible ... There were no lasting changes . ”
Kraus , who specializes in occupational and environmental medicine , said “ at the time , we had no idea ” about the monkey testing .
“ In hindsight it has to be said EUGT 's behavior was problematic , ” he told reporters .
EUGT , created by Volkswagen , Daimler and BMW in 2007 , was disbanded last year . The carmakers have since condemned EUGT 's work and suspended employees who were working for the group .
Skeena-Bulkley Valley MP Nathan Cullen questions Prime Minister Justin Trudeau decision to purchase the Kinder Morgan pipeline in the House of Commons on May 30 . ( CPAC photo )
The Trans Mountain pipeline may be located in the Lower Mainland , but Skeena-Bulkley Valley MP Nathan Cullen had some choice words for the Prime Minister Justin Trudeau today over the decision to purchase the project .
“ Liberals do know it 's not legal to smoke weed until August right because this makes no sense at all , ” Cullen said to Trudeau in a heated debate in the House of Commons on Wednesday , May 30 .
“ Only Liberals would dump $ 4.5 billion on a 65-year-old pipeline and call that an energy strategy . Only Liberals would try to force through a pipeline and tankers through traditional First Nations territory and call that reconciliation , ” Cullen said , adding , “ Watch he 's about to say the environment and economy go together . ”
# QP 8/ @ nathancullen PM will say that enviro & economy must go together . You know what else must go together ?

Cheers of support for Cullen , a member of the NDP , erupted from the House . In response , Trudeau reminded the House that the NDP had “ celebrated ” Alberta Premier Rachel Notley 's plan to both protect the environment and grow the economy .
“ Part of that plan included three elements , one , an absolute cap on oil sands emissions , two , a price on carbon that would apply to the Alberta economy , and three , getting our oil resources to new markets , ” Trudeau said , emphasizing that Notley is also NDP .
Cullen questioned the uncertainty of the project . If it was such a great risk for a commercial entity to take on , why would it be fair for the Canadian public to pick up the risk , he asked Trudeau . The Prime Minister responded with a quote from Notley that the government met the deadline set by Kinder Morgan and “ this project has more certainly than ever . ”
“ We have demonstrated that despite the actions of one province trying to block this pipeline , the project is in the national interest and the jobs that will be assured and defended in this project are in an integral part of our plan to fight climate change and grow the economy for future generations , ” Trudeau said .

Opponents to the Kinder Morgan project cite a 700 per cent increase in oil tanker traffic along the B.C . coast as one of the major red flags .
Cullen has been a fierce advocate for the oil tanker ban on the North Coast , tabling a private member 's bill for a tanker ban in 2014 . While he was pleased to see Bill C-48 , the Oil Tanker Moratorium Act , pass through the House of Commons in early May , he said it took too long , and now they have to wait for the Senate to pass the bill .

Several years before being arrested on April 20 for her alleged ties to a sex slave group , Smallville actor Allison Mack sent tweets to Emma Watson about `` an amazing women 's movement , '' as reported by Business Insider . At first glance , Mack 's tweets to Watson come off as pretty harmless — but , based on what 's recently been reported in regards to the 35-year-old 's alleged involvement with the NXIVM corporation , which provides `` executive success programs , '' Mack may have been using Twitter as a recruitment tool , according to People . ( Bustle attempted to reach out to a rep for Mack for comment on the allegations and her tweets , but did not receive a response at the time of publication . )
Mack pled not guilty to the accusations against her on April 20 , according to Page Six .
In the first of a series of tweets that were discovered by Business Insider , Mack initially attempted to contact Watson via Twitter back in January 2016 . `` . @ EmWatson I 'm a fellow actress like yourself & involved in an amazing women 's movement I think you 'd dig , '' Mack wrote . `` I 'd love to chat if you 're open . ''
Watson did not reply to Mack 's tweet on the social media platform , and Mack continued to reach out to the 28-year-old actor , and sent out two more tweets in February 2016 .
`` . @ EmWatson I participate in a unique human development & women 's movement I 'd love to tell you about . As a fellow actress I can relate so ... '' the Smallville star wrote . She went on to say , `` . @ EmWatson well to your vision and what you want to see in the world . I think we could work together . Let me know if you 're willing to chat . ''
Mack 's tweets to Watson did n't end there . She sent one final message to the actor in March 2016 , writing , `` @ TheCathyJensen @ EmWatson Thank you for the bump up ! Would love to chat with a fellow change-maker ! # InternationalWomensDay . ''
For the record , @ TheCathyJensen 's tweets are currently private , so the circumstances behind Mack 's final tweet to Watson is unclear . However , in light of the recent accusations against her , it seems as if Mack may have been attempting to promote — with her mention of the `` women 's movement '' — a group called DOS .
DOS , as per USA Today , was a `` women 's empowerment sorority '' allegedly led by NXIVM co-founder Keith Raniere for whom Mack was allegedly second in command . Mack was allegedly in charge of recruiting women for the sorority , after which , `` the victims [ of DOS ] were then exploited , both sexually and for their labor , to the defendants ' benefit , '' according to a statement from U.S. Attorney Richard Donoghue via USA Today .
On NXIVM 's site , Raniere , denied the allegations in a letter ( which you can read in full here ) :
Over the past months , there have been extensive independent investigations performed , by highly qualified individuals , and they have firmly concluded that there is no merit to the allegations that we are abusing , coercing or harming individuals . These allegations are most disturbing to me as non-violence is one of my most important values .
Additionally , I feel it is important to clarify the sorority is not part of NXIVM and that I am not associated with the group . I firmly support one 's right to freedom of expression , so what the sorority or any other social group chooses to do is not our business so long as there is no abuse .
Mack 's Smallville co-star , Kristin Kreuk , recently admitted to having been involved with NXIVM several years ago — but denies having had any acknowledgement of any alleged `` illegal or nefarious activity . ''
“ Thank you to all the brave women who have come forward to share their stories and expose DOS ; I ca n't imagine how difficult this has been for you , ” Kreuk wrote in a March 28 Twitter post . “ I am deeply disturbed and embarrassed to have been associated with NXIVM . I hope that the investigation leads to justice for all of those affected . ”
Kreuk has not said whether or not Mack played a part in her involvement with DOS , nor has she commented on the allegations against her former co-star , specifically . Mack did , however , reach out to another big name via Twitter back in 2013 — Kelly Clarkson — though there was no mention of NXIVM or DOS , and no allusion to her `` women 's movement . ''
`` @ kelly_clarkson I heard through the grapevine that you 're a fan of Smallville , '' Mack tweeted at Clarkson on July 20 , 2013 . `` I 'm a fan of yours as well ! I 'd love to chat sometime . ''
Both Raniere and Mack are facing charges of sex trafficking , sex trafficking conspiracy , and forced labor conspiracy . If convicted , they could each receive 15 years to life in prison . Raniere is currently being held without bail , according to USA Today .
Bustle reached out to reps for Watson and Clarkson for comment , but did not receive a response at the time of publication .

OTTAWA—Student and library associations are voicing their support for a section of the Copyright Act that allows materials to be used for educational purposes without infringing copyright .
The Canadian Alliance of Student Associations is telling a House of Commons committee today that restrictions on the scope of that exception will hurt students and educators , especially if it leads to higher costs .
The law is currently being reviewed by the Commons commitee on industry , science and technology .
The association says increased tuition costs for students and limited resources available to teachers would have a chilling effect on education .

A man with severe intellectual and physical disabilities in the care of IDEA Services was found to have a surgical glove in his bowel after a suspected sexual assault .
The Health and Disability Commission has published a damning finding into the care of the man , leading IDEA Services to apologise unreservedly to the man and his family and make a number of changes in how it cared for others like him .
The man , who was in his twenties , was extremely vulnerable and needed a very high level of support . He has intellectual , physical and developmental impairments , and had been in IDEA Services residential services between 2013 and 2015 .
Supplied Health and Disability deputy commissioner Rose Wall , pictured , said IDEA Services level of care `` fell short of the accepted standard '' .
He was housed in a flat , at an unidentified location , with another man who was intellectually disabled .

In the two years they lived together , there were numerous incidents involving the other man exposing himself to the man , as well as physically assaulting him . After a violent assault in January 2015 , that left him bruised , bloodied and traumatised , the victim was removed from the flat.﻿
Two months later , he became acutely unwell and was rushed to hospital by ambulance . Surgeons found an infection that had been caused by a plastic surgical glove in his bowel .
An independent review by IDEA Services could not determine who inserted the glove , or when or where it was inserted , but concluded it was most likely inserted as a result of a sexual assault .
After he was removed to another location in mid-2015 the man suffered burns after a staff member 's hot drink was left within his reach and spilled on him . After that , his mother removed him from IDEA 's care and he now lives with her .
The mother complained to the Health and Disability Commission . In a recently-released report , deputy commissioner Rose Wall found the care provided to the man `` fell short of the accepted standard '' .
IDEA Services failed to identify risks and put prevention strategies in place , failed to ensure sufficiently trained staff were on duty at all times and had placed the man with a man who exhibited inappropriate behaviour towards him .
Under a service agreement IDEA Services had with the Ministry of Health , the man was supposed to have received support for 24 hours a day , seven days a week .
But the two men were often cared for by just one staff member between them .
Wall said she was `` very critical '' that IDEA Services had not put processes in place to ensure there were sufficient staff on duty at all times
After the glove was removed from the man 's bowel , a doctor said it was unlikely to have been swallowed . The doctor could not say how long it had been there , and the man was unable to tell anyone .
An independent review could not determine who was responsible , but said the glove was most likely inserted by a third party in a sexual assault . Wall was unable to make a factual finding on how or when the glove was inserted .
Wall recommended an independent review of the effectiveness of changes made in light of events highlighted in the case , and to ensure plans for each client in the organisation 's care in the man 's regional location were reviewed and up to date .
If that review found deficiencies , the IDEA Services Commission wanted it to extend to a random audit of clients in its residential care facilities throughout New Zealand .
She also recommended that IDEA Services apologise to the man and his family .
IDEA Services acting chief executive Donna Mitchell said the organisation had apologised unreservedly for the incidents outlined in the report .
`` We failed in our duty of care to the person and his family . We deeply regret the incidents , which fell short of the service and standards that our staff provide across the country every day . It simply was not good enough in this instance .
`` We have and will continue to learn from this and we are implementing all the report 's recommendations , including an independent review of the local service , '' Mitchell said .
Health Ministry group manager of disability support services Toni Atkinson said the agency was `` very sorry this happened , and we acknowledge this was distressing for the person concerned , and their family '' .
`` This is n't the quality of support the Ministry expects of a provider and we welcome the fact that IDEA accepts all the HDC recommendations , '' Atkinson said .
- Stuff
Agra : In the backstreets of Agra 's Muslim quarter , where shoes have been made for centuries , small-scale manufacturers are firing workers and families cutting back on spending as a government crackdown on cattle slaughter ripples through the community .
The election of Prime Minister Narendra Modi of the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP ) three years ago has emboldened right-wing Hindu groups to push harder for protection of the cow , an animal they consider sacred .
Authorities in the country 's most populous state , Uttar Pradesh , started closing down unlicensed abattoirs in March , immediately hitting production and sales in the Muslim-dominated meat industry .
Last month Modi 's government also banned trading cattle for slaughter , including not just cows , whose killing was already outlawed in most states , but also buffalo , an animal used for meat and leather .
Now the squeeze is spreading to others in the Muslim minority and to lower-caste Hindus who cart cattle , labour in tanneries and make shoes , bags and belts - including for big name brands such as Zara and Clarks .
Frequent attacks by right-wing Hindus against workers they accuse of harming cattle have further rattled the industry .
Social tensions
Much of India 's meat and leather trade takes place in the informal economy , meaning the impact of the closing of illegal abattoirs and ban on trading for slaughter is hard to measure .
But cattle markets are reporting a big slowdown in trade and tanneries a shortage of hides .
Abdul Faheem Qureshi , a representative of India 's Muslim Qureshi community of butchers , said in Uttar Pradesh some markets trading 1,000 animals last year were now down to as few as 100 .
The decline in production means fewer jobs for two of India 's poorest communities , and risks inflaming social tensions at a time when Modi has vowed to boost employment and accelerate economic growth ahead of the next general election in 2019 .
Some large leather manufacturers support the Uttar Pradesh state government 's move , arguing that allowing only licensed abattoirs to operate will clean the industry 's image .
Bigger exporters also say they have enough leather as they source hides widely , including from abroad .
Still , millions work in the meat and leather industries , which are worth more than $ 16 billion in annual sales .
When Reuters visited the narrow shoemaking lanes of Agra , a crowd of Muslims breaking their Ramadan fast gathered , shouting angrily that they were no longer safe to trade buffalo , buy cow leather for shoes or to do work that their community has done for centuries for fear of being attacked by Hindu vigilantes .
`` They want to weaken us . They want to snatch our bread , '' says 66-year-old Mohammad Muqeem , whose workers stitch $ 3 shoes in his cellar , referring to the closure of slaughterhouses and recent attacks on cattle traders .
Muqeem 's monthly income has halved to $ 300 since last year as leather has become scarce . His dozen casual workers , down from 40 , now use mostly synthetic materials .
Impossible target
Like meat , India 's leather industry has expanded rapidly in the last decade , providing relatively well-paid factory work and cash for families stitching informally in their homes .
Agra , in Uttar Pradesh , turns out a million pairs of shoes a day for domestic buyers and European labels such as Inditex-owned Zara and Clarks . An estimated 40 percent of the population of the northern Indian city , famed as the home of the Taj Mahal , depends on the industry .
Clarks said in a statement that it does not use leather from Indian-origin cows and that the small amount of buffalo leather it sources from India had not been impacted . Zara and did not respond to requests for comment .
India is one of the world 's top five producers of leather , with skins coming from cows that die of natural causes or from the legal slaughter of buffalo .
The government is targeting leather revenues of $ 27 billion ( 21.14 billion pounds ) - more than double today 's level - by 2020 as part of a job creation push .
But in May , the government decreed that animal markets could only trade cow and buffalo for agricultural purposes such as ploughing and dairy production - a move many in the industry say contradicts its plans to grow leather sales .
The environment minister said this week the government could amend the rule after a court temporarily stayed the order and there was widespread anger in regions where meat and leather are important to the local culture and economy .
But industry officials said the shock of the ban , coming on the heels of the crackdown on abattoirs and attacks against cattle workers , meant business would not easily recover .
Companies say the government 's leather target would be impossible to meet unless the restrictions are reversed .
`` There is a lot of panic in the industry after the latest order , which has come as the biggest blow , '' Puran Dawar , chairman of Agra-based exporter Dawar Footwear Industries , said as hundreds of workers moulded shoes on the factory floor , referring to the ban on cattle traded for slaughter .
`` There are grave concerns about the supply of leather , exports of shoes and overall employment . ''
The commerce ministry did not respond to requests for comment .
In Uttar Pradesh , Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath , a controversial Hindu priest , had made closing unlicensed slaughter houses a priority after Modi appointed him in March .
About 30 percent of hides , mostly from buffaloes , that supply tanneries in the state are from unlicensed abattoirs .
Sitting in his one-room shop in Agra 's leather market , Mohammad Hashim , a burly leather dealer in his sixties , said business was down 40 percent in the last three months .
The recent scarcity of hides had hurt Hindus as much as Muslims , he said , pointing to the quiet streets outside and a Hindu man struggling to sell puffed rice snacks from his cart .
Modi 's election in 2014 and a resurgence in right-wing Hindu activism have increased concerns among Muslims that their livelihoods are under attack . As a minority making up 14 percent of India 's 1.3 billion people , they are generally poorer and less literate than majority Hindus .
When worshippers finishing evening prayers at the Mughal-era mosque in the shoemaking quarter of Agra are asked whether the chief minister handpicked by Modi is to blame , one of the Imams thunders : `` Modi is to blame . He is targeting Muslims . ''
In an interview with Reuters , Chief Minister Adityanath rejected accusations the BJP had targeted any specific group .
`` Illegal slaughterhouses operated across the state and many big and small leather traders were buying raw material at cheapest rates from unlicensed slaughterhouses to maximise profits , '' he said in Lucknow , the state capital .
Wider industry hit
In the industrial city of Kanpur , 250 km ( 155 miles ) east of Agra , tanneries processing buffalo skins are reporting job losses as the availability of hides dries up .
Nayyar Jamal , general secretary of Kanpur 's Small Tanners ' Association , reckons as many as 400,000 employees in Kanpur 's leather and related industries are temporarily jobless , including some laid off because of environmental curbs on tannery pollution . Supplies of local hides have dropped by 20 to 30 percent .
Qureshi , from the butchers ' organisation , estimates that 3.5 million employees in Uttar Pradesh alone have been directly hit .
`` More than the economic loss , the government has injected fear , '' said Chandra Bhan Prasad , a writer and businessman from the Dalit community , as those at the bottom of Hinduism 's social hierarchy once called `` untouchables '' are known . Dalits and Muslims often work in trades that higher-caste Hindus traditionally consider beneath them .
Tannery owner Mohammad Ikram said he was only able to procure 4,000 hides a month - down from 25,000 - because even truckers transporting legally obtained cow or buffalo hides fear attacks from vigilantes . He has a month 's inventory left , and when that runs out he will have to start shedding staff .
Shahnawaz Qureshi , a wage labourer stuffing synthetic shoes into plastic bags in Muqeem 's cellar in Agra , lost his last job after his employer could no longer afford leather .
He now earns 3,000 rupees - or $ 47 - a month , down from 4,500 in his previous job , and together with his father 's income supports three sisters and his mother .
`` I decided to sign up for this job despite the fact that I earn reasonably less here , '' he said .

The victory did n't erase the painful memories of previous Octobers . The performance did n't guarantee anything more than a 1-0 lead for the Dodgers in a best-of-five National League division series .
What Kershaw earned Friday night in the 9-5 win over the Arizona Diamondbacks was another opportunity — specifically , another opportunity to fail , in the words of the well-traveled philosopher who will follow him in the Dodgers rotation .
“ That 's basically what it is , ” Game 2 starter Rich Hill said . “ You 're going out there and you 're putting yourself in a position to fail , but in doing that , you 're giving it everything you can to succeed . ”
And so it started again for Kershaw , who scaled the mound at Dodger Stadium and exposed himself to the possibility of another crushing ending in exchange for an opportunity to reach heights he 's never previously reached in his celebrated career .
It was this fearlessness that was behind each of the 100 pitches he delivered and each of the seven strikeouts he recorded over 6 1/3 innings . It was this fearlessness that made the Dodgers ignore whatever uncertainty crept into their minds over a frustrating five-week stretch to close the regular season .
“ Any time you have someone out there exuding that passion for what they do , it 's a magnet , ” Hill said . “ You attract that intensity from other players . ”
Kershaw will have to pitch better if the Dodgers are to win the World Series — he gave up four runs , each of them on a solo home run — but he also has a stronger group of players around him to pick him up , as it did Friday night .
“ We 've said that depth is a key word around here in Dodger Stadium , ” Kershaw said .
Lost in the all of the talk about his fastball and slider , his conditioning and his competitiveness , is his emotional resilience . Every time the game has knocked him down , he has picked himself back up . He has experienced the worst postseason baseball has to offer , but always returned for more . “ Thankful for another opportunity , ” Kershaw said .
He welcomed the latest opportunity , knowing fully well this October could end how it did in 2013 , when he melted down against the St. Louis Cardinals in the NL Championship Series .
Or how it did in 2014 , when he and the Dodgers were knocked out again by the Cardinals , this time on a home run by Matt Adams .
Or how it did last year , when he lost an elimination game to the Chicago Cubs in the NLCS .
He entered Friday night with a career playoff earned-run average of 4.55 , which ranked 61st among the 67 pitchers with 10 or more postseason starts .
There were times Kershaw was combative with reporters in the aftermath of these defeats , but he was never dismissive of the media . He never pretended the failure did n't bother him and he never told his critics they had “ sorry lives , ” as LeBron James once did after falling in the NBA Finals .
He recharged over the winter , regained his resolve and returned to work with as much intensity as he had the previous season .
On pretty much every day he does n't pitch , he is the first Dodgers player on the field , already running in the outfield when reporters start trickling into the pressbox .
The best images from Game 1 of the Dodgers ' National League division series with the Arizona Diamondbacks .
And that was how he attacked the Diamondbacks . He was clearly amped up in the first inning , touching 96 mph with his fastball on the stadium radar gun . The Dodgers followed his lead , scoring four times in the bottom of the inning against rattled Diamondbacks starter Taijuan Walker .
But a familiar problem surfaced in the third inning , when A.J . Pollock homered to left-center field to cut the Dodgers ' lead to 4-1 . Kershaw gave up a career-high 23 home runs this season , including five in the six starts he made after returning from the disabled list on Sept. 1 .
J.D . Martinez sent the ball into the seats by the left-field foul pole in the sixth inning . Ketel Marte and Jeff Mathis hit back-to-back homers in the seventh , reducing the Dodgers ' advantage to 7-4 and ending Kershaw 's night .
The blasts by Marte and Mathis inflated Kershaw 's postseason ERA in the seventh inning to 25.50 as a starter .
The four home runs were the most ever given up by a Dodgers pitcher in a postseason game .
But that wo n't scare Kershaw . If the Cardinals and Cubs could n't break him , this wo n't , either .

IITS EFFECTS
A DRIVER 'S group is asking government to look for alternative livelihood programs for jeepney drivers , operators and other affected sectors before even thinking about implementing the Integrated Intermodal Transport System ( IITS ) .
Greg Perez , chairman of Pinagkaisang Samahan ng mga Tsuper at Operators Nationwide ( Piston ) in Cebu , said the four-component transport system project would displace thousands of jeepney drivers and operators , leaving them without any livelihood .
“ Di lang driver ang maapektohan sa ingon ana nga mga proyekto kon di apil na pod ang mga gamay nga mga nagnegosyo sa kadalanan . Apektado ang mga gagmayng vendors nga nanginabuhi sa mga karsada , ” said Perez .
( Not only the drivers and operators will be affected but also the small businesses in the streets . )
The IITS is composed of the Bus Rapid Transit ( BRT ) , Light Rail Transit ( LRT ) , point-to-point ( P2P ) bus system and a monorail project .
In a statement on Monday , Presidential Assistant for the Visayas Michael Dino said the Department of Transportation looks forward to the “ partial operability ” of the IITS within a year and a half to two years .
However , Dino clarified that DOTr will only implement BRT on roads with at least three lanes .
Perez said they will continue to protest against these projects if the government can not present a concrete alternative livelihood program for those who are affected .
He said government should study if the projects suit the people and demanded concrete plans that those who would be displaced would be given an alternative livelihood .
For the BRT route alone , Perez said that around 3,000 jeepney drivers will be affected .
He said that if the IITS would cover the whole Metro Cebu , from Carcar City to Danao City , at least 10,000 jeepney drivers will be affected .
Perez said the government should also listen to the side of the transport sector in formulating the “ basket of solutions ” to the traffic woes of the metropolis .
Perez said the transportation department has not engaged in any dialogue with the transport groups .
Meanwhile , the Cebu City government is urging DOTr to fast-track the implementation of the P17-billion BRT project .
City Administrator Nigel Paul Villarete told reporters on Wednesday that they welcome the decision of the DOTr to include the BRT project in its IITS project .
Villarete said that he will be sending a letter to the DOTr to present their suggestions on how to expedite the implementation of the BRT . /with Morexette Marie B. Erram

MATCHUPS
When Penn State has the ball
Offensive line vs . Defensive line
The Nittany Lions will be facing a massive 3-4 front for the second time in as many games , and they handled the different look much better against Wisconsin as the Big Ten Championship Game went along . Of course , Wisconsin did n't have a nose tackle quite like USC 's Stevie Tu'ikolovatu , a graduate transfer from Utah whose emergence as the season progressed had as much to do with USC 's resurgence as anything . Only one of USC 's last four opponents rushed for better than 3 ypc against it . Penn State will need to get C Brian Gaia some help on Tu'ikolovatu with guards Steven Gonzalez and Connor McGovern . But they 'll also have to watch DE Rasheem Green , a prototypical 3-4 end who can get to the quarterback .
EDGE : USC
Quarterbacks/Receivers vs . Secondary
USC has some terrific players in the defensive backfield , led of course by CB Adoree ' Jackson , but bolstered by safeties Leon McQuay III and Marvin Tell III , who are joined by the very active Chris Hawkins on passing downs . But , teams with dual-threat quarterbacks have had some consistent success throwing the ball against USC this season . Penn State has that type of QB in Trace McSorley , and receivers Chris Godwin , DaeSean Hamilton and DeAndre Thompkins have the speed to get open when the pocket is moved even against terrific athletes . The Lions will miss the explosiveness of the suspended Saeed Blacknall , but TE Mike Gesicki has been stretching the field all season . The Lions also will look to get RB Saquon Barkley more involved in the passing game .
EDGE : Penn State
Running backs vs. Linebackers
The USC linebackers play a lot like Wisconsin 's , and they 're at least as talented . Inside , sophomore Cameron Smith and senior Michael Hutchings are the leading tacklers on the team , and they 're aggressive near the line of scrimmage . They 'll be in position to make some plays in the backfield . But it 's the outside backers who can get to the quarterback that will have to play well for the Trojans to corral the Nittany Lions offense . Junior Uchenna Nwosu and Porter Gustin have combined for 8.5 sacks and 19.5 tackles for loss this season . They 're going to have to keep track of not just McSorley , but Barkley , who has had a few weeks to get healthy and should be a major contributor against a defense that has struggled against premiere backs .

When USC has the ball
Offensive line vs . Defensive line
This is not the biggest offensive line Penn State will have faced this season – outside of senior RT Zach Banner , who at 6-foot-9 , 360 pounds is built like the Incredible Hulk – but it may be the most athletic group overall . Junior guards Damien Mama and Viane Talamaivao are maulers inside , and LT Chad Wheeler has helped the offensive line allow only six sacks in the last 10 games . In its last nine games , Penn State has registered 29 sacks , so something will have to give . The Lions will have to stay fresh inside , and ends Evan Schwan and Garrett Sickels are going to have to win some battles against Wheeler and Banner .
EDGE : Penn State
Quarterbacks/Receivers vs . Secondary
A very intriguing matchup here , because Penn State 's secondary will basically be facing what it sees in practice most every day : An athletic quarterback who can move around , and big , physical , talented receivers who will challenge the Lions ' shorter-but-aggressive cornerbacks , John Reid and Grant Haley . USC QB Sam Darnold has led the Trojans to eight consecutive wins after taking over as the starter on Sept. 23 against Utah . Darnold has completed 68 percent of his throws for 2,633 yards and 26 touchdowns despite starting just nine games , and he 's also a threat to run . His three top targets are all 6-foot or taller , led by 6-foot-2 junior JuJu Smith-Schuster , who has scored nine touchdowns on his 63 catches . They need to win the battles with the smaller corners on 50-50 balls , and they 've been as good at that as anybody in the nation .
EDGE : USC
Running backs vs. Linebackers
Ronald Jones II does n't have the nation talking about him as the next in a long line of great USC tailbacks , but his numbers certainly put him in that discussion . The sophomore is big ( 6-foot-1 , 195 pounds ) and fast , and he amassed 1,027 yards and 11 touchdowns this season . Backup Justin Davis is a similar player who is more active in the passing game . The Nittany Lions have the depth at linebacker to keep them in check , though , even with Manny Bowen suspended . Jason Cabinda and Brandon Bell have been arguably the two most important players on the defense this season , developing against the pass but continued stalwarts against the run . USC is going to get its yards on the ground , but Cabinda and Bell are talented enough to limit the big-play opportunities .
EDGE : Penn State
Special teams
Kicking game
It could be interesting if this game gets down to a late field goal attempt , because both teams have pretty good , accurate kickers . USC 's Matt Boermeester has missed five of his 20 attempts , but two of those were beyond 50 yards , and he has only missed twice on eight attempts from 40-49 yards , with four of his makes coming from more than 45 . Tyler Davis has n't missed a field goal attempt for Penn State this season that has n't been blocked , but he has n't hit a kick longer than 40 yards . The punting game has been so-so for USC , though . Sophomore Chris Tilbey is averaging just 37.8 yards per kick , although nearly 40 percent of his kicks pin opponents inside the 20 .
EDGE : Penn State
Return game
Well , the Trojans are n't going to lose many battles in the return game , because Adoree ' Jackson has been such a threat on both kick and punt returns ( two touchdowns in both areas ) . But 52 percent of Boermeester 's kicks do n't get returned , either . By comparison , even the strong-legged Joey Julius is only booting touchbacks at a 48 percent clip for the Nittany Lions . Julius and punter Blake Gillikin are going to have to keep the ball as far away from Jackson as possible .
EDGE : USC
Prediction
These teams are so similar , it 's difficult to think any result would be surprising . Either team can blow out the other . Either team can win a close battle . An argument can be made for any result , and given how many weeks both teams have had to prepare , anything is possible . If Penn State wants to win , it will have to start better than it has during the regular season . If USC wants to win , it will have to finish better . Both teams have a ton of momentum . Both have changed their seasons after slow starts . They key to who will keep that momentum going lies , as it so often does , in the play of the quarterback . Great as Sam Darnold has been for USC , Penn State 's Trace McSorley has consistently come up with bigger plays , in bigger moments , all season long . Penn State won the better conference . Penn State beat the better teams . It should come out with a victory in its biggest game in years .

OLB Koa Farmer
Penn State will be playing the Rose Bowl without its steady , developing sophomore linebacker Manny Bowen , who has been suspended for the game for violating team rules . But it may turn out to be a blessing in disguise . The key to containing USC 's high-powered offense , at least according to what has been successful this season , is the ability to pressure its gifted quarterback , redshirt freshman Sam Darnold . Well , Farmer has been about the most dynamic pass rusher the Nittany Lions have had down the stretch , even though he has played sparingly . The sophomore from Lake View Terrace , California , just a stone 's throw from Pasadena , has three sacks in limited action , including one against Wisconsin in the Big Ten Championship Game . Penn State will need him to turn more reps into more production .

CB Adoree ' Jackson
Jackson will be the second Jim Thorpe Award winner Penn State has faced this season , but he adds even another dimension to his game that Iowa cornerback Desmond King ( last year 's Thorpe winner ) did not . The junior from Illinois is n't just a shutdown corner who has intercepted 11 passes and broken up 11 more this season , nor is he just a dynamic kick returner who has brought two kickoffs and two punts back for scores this season . He 'll also play a little bit on offense , averaging 9.8 yards on five carries to go along with a 52-yard touchdown catch . So , the Nittany Lions will have to worry about the 5-foot-11 , 185-pound junior not only when they 're on offense , but when they 're on defense , as well .
‘ I was prepared for yesterday . I had gone through the motions of having my son die like this '

Cody Isaacson 's father David was n't surprised to learn his son died in a hail of bullets in his Chilliwack home early morning on Jan. 31 .
Heartbroken at the loss , certainly . Angry at the devastating effects of illicit street drugs , indeed .
But most of all , David is frustrated at a perceived lack of investigative work done by the RCMP to solve crimes involving those in the drug underworld .
“ I anticipated this happening , ” David Isaacson told The Progress in an interview a day after his son was killed when at least a dozen bullets were fired at the known drug house Cody worked out of at the corner of Broadway and Cedar avenues .

“ I was prepared for yesterday . I had gone through the motions of having my son die like this . ”
Chilliwack 's first homicide of the year happened just after 6 a.m. at the house at 9291 Broadway Ave. Neighbours reported hearing between six and eight shots fired at the time , although as many as a dozen bullet holes were visible in the front door and wall of the bright yellow house . Each hole marked with a letter , “ A ” through to “ L ” labelled by RCMP forensics investigators .
At a press conference at the scene Wednesday afternoon , IHIT spokesperson Cpl . Frank Jang confirmed 28-year-old Cody Isaacson was the victim of the brazen killing , a person known to Chilliwack RCMP .
But as yet police have not yet confirmed that Cody was also the victim of a home invasion at a house on Second Avenue on Oct. 25 , 2017 . The Progress has learned he was indeed in that house along with his girlfriend when a number of individuals wearing masks stormed in with guns and hammers .
Reports are that three shots were fired , none striking anyone , although David Isaacson insists Cody suffered injuries to his face from hammer blows before he took a machete away from an attacker and fought back .

Asked to connect the October home invasion with the Jan. 31 homicide , Cpl . Jang said IHIT investigators will be working with the local RCMP Serious Crimes Unit to make connections between other incidents .
A frustrated father , David insists police were aware of who was involved in the home invasion but did little to investigate it , something he thinks might have prevented Cody 's death on Jan. 31 .
“ I knew something bad was going to happen to Cody , ” he said . “ Let 's face it , when you are in that lifestyle you make a lot of enemies . But the police did no investigation from the earlier home invasion . They know who did it . ”
Still , he says IHIT told him on Jan. 31 “ they want to solve this , ” and a friend told him Cody 's photo was posted on SkyTrain in Metro Vancouver with the RCMP looking for tips .
And while David speaks highly of his recently murdered son , he understands the “ business ” and insists that in the context of the underground drug world , Cody was one of the good guys .
” He took good care of his crew , ” David said . “ Nobody has anything bad to say about him . He was always the person to give something . I am kind compassionate to others , and Cody was the same way . ”
Cody does not have any local criminal contacts according to Court Services Online , not surprising to his father who said he unfortunately only got into dealing last summer .
He does , however , have a history in the north . Upon his murder , the Prince George Citizen went with the headline : “ Former Prince George drug dealer shot to death in Chilliwack , ” pointing to his 2014 conviction for weapons and drug possession leading to a 442-day sentence in jail .
The Citizen reports he was arrested twice within three weeks at the same Jasper Street home .
“ On both occasions , police found enough crack cocaine , heroin and methamphetamine to suggest it was used to supply drugs to lower-level drug houses around the city , ” according to Citizen reporter Mark Nielsen .
Still , even here , father David comes to his son 's defence saying that Cody was n't at home when the drugs and weapons were found , his girlfriend was , so he could have walked away .
“ He manned up because she was home , not because he had to , but he did , ” David said . “ Cody was a man when it came to doing the right thing , and that has made him some enemies . ”
David hoped , though , that Cody would leave the world , something that nearly destroyed his own life . A recovering meth addict himself , David says he turned Cody on to his relatively new faith in Jesus and he thought Cody was doing well .
But meth is a stubborn foe .
“ The crystal meth is a really , really bad drug . It destroys everything that gets in its path . It happened to us . ”
In a wide-ranging interview on Feb. 1 , David seemed remarkably calm about what happened , something he attributed to his faith , but he also was a little conflicted on what to do next , admitting he may have still been in shock .
Told by someone via text the night of the killing that the Red Scorpions gang were in town and he needed to flee , his defiant response : “ I 'm not going anywhere . ”
Upon further reflection of his goals pursuing his woodworking , his religion and moving on with his life , now with the death of his son , David switched gears .
“ Cody was a good kid , ” he said , getting emotional for the first time , suggesting that maybe it was soon time for him to leave the Fraser Valley .
“ There 's nothing for me here anymore . ”
Cody Isaacson leaves behind three children .

Elle King ‘ s wedding day was anything but textbook .
On Saturday , the “ Ex 's and Oh 's ” singer was set to wed fiancé Andrew “ Fergie ” Ferguson but was actually at an Eagles of Death Metal concert in Seattle instead .
“ Skipped out on my wedding . I married Rock & Roll instead so I hopped on tour with EAGLES OF F–KING DEATH METAL , ” King shared on Instagram .
The daughter of comedian Rob Schneider , King , 27 , accepted Ferguson 's proposal last February after he popped the question on a sailboat under the Golden Gate Bride in San Francisco . As King recalled on a March episode of “ Say Yes to the Dress , ” Ferguson proposed 12 days after they met .
A post shared by Elle King ( @ elleking ) on Apr 15 , 2017 at 9:25pm PDT
“ We met in London in the lobby of my hotel , and it was like we had known each other for 10 years , ” she said . “ We hung out all night , it was my last day in London , and he was like , ‘ You ca n't go home . ' And I did n't get on my flight , and I stayed in London . Two days later , he quit his job and moved to America . ”
While she found her dream dress , King hinted the pair had split following a cryptic Instagram post from March 28 .
“ Got ta say … no matter how heartbreaking one day may be , it 's hard to not smile in this California sunshine , ” she wrote .
Earlier this month , King penned a lengthy note detailing the importance of self-worth .
“ Been a really rough and insane start to this year , ” King shared , along with a snapshot of her puppy . “ Lately I do n't cry very much . I feel like it will just be an explosion if I did . But seeing my little baby girl again , and having her by my side , well I lost it . She 's my best friend and the only true loyalty I 've ever known .
“ Today someone tried to make me feel a certain way about myself . But we have to remember , no one can make you feel anything unless you let them . Do n't give people power over you . As a human , other people may try to be threatening in more ways than just verbal or physical acts , ” she continued . “ Always be strong . Always have dogs . Never forget your rights and your worth . If no one has told you today , I love you and I think you 're beautiful and are worthy of love and kindness . Be safe . Be smart . Do n't let anyone make you feel fearful or small . Love yourself . ”
A rep for King did not immediately return a request for comment .
Progressives for Immigration Reform ( PFIR ) , the `` non-profit '' that bought $ 80,000 worth of ads running to full houses at Bay Area Rapid Transport ( BART ) stations and trains told Firstpost that the ad blitz that launched late last week in Silicon Valley is the result of `` more than a year of thinking about the effects of immigration and hearing from US tech workers who could not find employment . ''
Asked about the lush budget , PFIR 's Kevin Lynn shrugged it off - “ Yeah , that 's about right , say $ 80,000 We get grants , donations .. we 've been around for 10 years , you see . ''
The timing of the ad campaign takes steel wool to an already open wound for the H1B worker in America .
`` Do these guys know how hard it is to get an H1B visa '' , reads one reaction on Twitter .
Oh wow this is infuriating . Do these people even know ... how hard ... it is to get an H1B ? ! https : //t.co/Cei9jCbwNo — Mariana Alfaro ( @ marianaa_alfaro ) March 16 , 2018
That sums up the angst on the receiving end quite accurately .
The H1B visa is already so highly regulated and the paperwork burden so high that Canada is fast becoming a huge draw . Those who remain in the US on an H1B can broadly be divided into two camps - those who are on a plain vanilla H1B and those who have applied for permanent residency . The second category keeps investing time in the hope that their PR status is cemented and with every passing year , the difficulty levels of a clean break rise for a variety of reasons including sunk cost on many of life 's non-negotiables . For relatively newer H1B workers , the current political mood and backlash present a very different world than what it was even three years ago .
In the Bay Area , the BART ads are all over social groups . People are telling us the ads are `` scary '' and `` unnerving '' .
For PFIR , the BART ads are just a baby step . What they are bulldozing towards for is a `` political solution '' .
`` We 'll get US tech workers together , we 'll organize and we need to have a political solution to this , '' said Lynn on his way to California - the location of PFIR 's headline hunting . `` We 're going there to speak with US tech workers who have found us through the ad , '' said Lynn who confirmed that PFIR 's choice of the Bay Area was a no-brainer . `` Yeah , Silicon Valley , that 's why we chose it , '' he said .
Southern Poverty Law Center traces links from the past showing Progressives for Immigration Reform 's ties with a man called John Tanton - described as the “ racist architect of the modern anti-immigrant movement . ”
“ He ( Tanton ) created a network of organizations – the Federation for American Immigration Reform ( FAIR ) , the Center for Immigration Studies ( CIS ) and NumbersUSA – that have profoundly shaped the immigration debate in the United States ” , says SPLC .
So far , Indian H1B workers are bound by a loosely defined creed that it might be better not to raise an alarm over PFIR 's ads on social media and instead let the storm pass . Even if they stay mum , the message is still getting seeded without an equal counterpoint across millions of commuters everyday for a month . This also points to a communications battle that is being dominated by those with massive treasure chests and a unified agenda .
In other news , this is a big week for the H1B community in the US and visa aspirants from all over . The new H1B season begins April 2 - the day after Easter weekend in America on April 2 so last minute paperwork is in full swing across outsourcing giants ' offices while H1B workers already in the US on the Green Card waitlist are hoping for a breakthrough when a $ 1.3 trillion catchall spending bill comes up for a vote in the US Congress mid week . Here 's a round-up of the headlines :
Immigration proposals still in dispute as shutdown looms
Indians in the US who have applied for permanent residency are keeping their fingers crossed for some key items on their bucket list to be ticked off in this massive spending bill - easing country caps on Green Cards and reducing the average wait time of 10-15 years per application for those on employment based quotas are right on top . On the other side , does this resonate loud enough ? Will Bob Goodlatte or Kevin Yoder be able to deliver ? Or is this the hill where these bills will die ? The latest tally looks like this : DACA - Not such a hot button . Trump wants funding for his wall along Mexico , Democrats may be willing to accept funding but they are dead against Trump 's other demands for changes in legal immigration - which is where H1B figures . Over the weekend , the White House on Sunday made an 11th-hour push for billions of dollars in border wall funding but came up against the Democratic stonewall on the fine print . All the headlines are about DACA ( which is essentially about illegal arrivals ) while legal immigrants are stunned by the uphill battle this represents for their public communication effors .
H1B filing season opens April 2
The H1B visa filing season for the fiscal year 2019 ( starting 1 October , 2018 ) which allows US companies to hire foreign workers will open on 2 April , 2018 , USCIS officials have confirmed . Indian companies have traditionally led the sweepstakes cornering the lion 's share of visas each year . With less than two weeks to the finish line , immigration lawyers have their work cut out in Trump 's America which is doubling down on H1B related abuse . On the supply side , H1B hopefuls who are applying under the stipulated 'caps ' know that skill , talent or the strength of their CV have no role at all , it 's just pure luck in a lottery that will decide whether they get chosen . In Hyderabad , India , all roads lead to the gates of the Balaji Visa temple .
A girl was struck by a car in East Moline in the 1400 block of 18th Avenue .
The girl was struck by a westbound vehicle and was taken to a local hospital where she is awake and alert .
East Moline Police responded to the scene , closing off 16th and 14th street upon arrival .

This Saturday , March 24 , cities around the world will see a wave of March For Our Lives ( MFOL ) demonstrations — gatherings of people demanding an end to America 's persistent gun violence . Organized as a direct response to the school shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas ( MSD ) High School in Florida on February 14 , the main march will take place in Washington , D.C. , with 817 sibling events around the globe , according to the event 's website . And because there are some similarities between MFOL and the Women 's Marches , you may be wondering whether the famous pink pussy hats will be making an appearance this weekend .
But while the two events do have some commonalities ( like disagreement with the current government and protest against the President 's policy positions ) , the MFOL is pretty different from the Women 's Marches . For one thing , the MFOL is explicitly nonpolitical , as stated on the event 's website . And the students from MSD who are speaking out and taking action with state and national lawmakers fall on both the conservative and liberal sides of the spectrum , as reported by the Washington Post . And while the Women 's Marches were open to participants of any gender , their name indicated that their purpose was to raise awareness of issues particular to women . The MFOL does n't make any such distinction : Though organized by students , it 's meant to appeal to , include , and represent people regardless of age or gender .

And the MFOL has developed its own brand of swag , as well . Krista Suh , a self-described craftivist and an originator of the Pussyhat Project in November 2016 , has recently launched a companion piece of knitwear just for the MFOL : the evil eye glove , a fingerless hand warmer with a large eye stitched on the palm . The idea is for all the march participants to wear a pair and thus create an enormous `` sea of eyes '' to show Congress that people are watching , according to Lifehacker . Suh is looking for volunteers to donate 438 pairs of the gloves to the D.C. MFOL , one pair for every person killed or injured at a school shooting since 2014 , as reported by the New York Times .
If you 'd like to join in the sea of eyes , either in D.C. or in your own town , you have a couple of options . You can create your own evil eye gloves following the pattern designed by Suh — even a complete knitting newbie can purl her own pair with the help of Joy Macdonell 's video tutorial . Or , if you prefer to purchase , there are plenty of options available on Etsy and eBay .
Of course , even with gloves on your hands , you still have space on your head for a pink pussy hat , should you choose to wear one . Before making your decision , though , it might be helpful to understand how perceptions of it have shifted since the trend was started .

For the first Women 's March in January 2017 , the hat was widely seen as a symbol of the participants ' unified protest , particularly against the President 's infamous remarks about grabbing women by their genitalia . But by the time the second Women 's March rolled around in January 2018 , opinion was pretty split on whether it was a good idea to dust off the hats to wear again . Organizers of some marches declared that they would n't be wearing the hats because `` the pink pussyhat excludes and is offensive to transgender women and gender non-binary people who do n't have typical female genitalia and to women of color because their genitals are more likely to be brown than pink , '' according to USA Today .
However , the creators of the hat have said they chose pink not because of any association with skin color , but because it 's typically associated with femininity . And the style and shape of the hat were not meant to resemble a vulva , but to look like the ears of pussycat and thus remind people of the President 's offensive statement . The intention was to reclaim the world `` pussy '' and the color pink . But , understanding that not everyone was interpreting the hat the same way , the creators wrote , `` Anyone who supports women 's rights is welcome to wear a Pussyhat . It does not matter if you have a vulva or what color your vulva may be . If a participant wants to create a Pussyhat that reflects the color of her vulva , we support her choice . ''
So while the pussy hat is n't the insignia of this weekend 's march , there 's a good chance we 'll see a few people wearing them — perhaps along with a pair of shiny new evil eye gloves . If you want to sport your own pink pussy hat and bring it into dialog with this new protest , that 's totally up to you .

Beijing : Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping will not sign any agreements or issue a joint statement at the Wuhan summit this week but they will try to build mutual trust and reach important consensus to resolve the outstanding issues , a top Chinese official said on Tuesday.Prime Minister Modi will travel to China on April 27 for an informal summit with President Xi in the central China 's Wuhan city . `` Both sides have agreed not to sign an agreement or release any joint document but reach important consensus to resolve outstanding issues , '' Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Kong Xuanyou told the media here on the two-day summit.This informal summit is the first of its kind and there is no precedent in each other 's country , he said , explaining why both the leaders opted to hold the summit . `` At the informal summit , the two leaders will have heart-to-heart discussions on overarching issues and try to build mutual trust and consensus to resolve outstanding differences , '' Kong said.Asked whether the Dokalam issue and the boundary dispute will figure in the talks , Kong said Dokalam happened because of lack of trust . `` The two countries need to create conditions and trust between them to resolve the boundary issue , '' he added.Kong said both President Xi and Prime Minister Modi have strategic vision and historical responsibility . `` Both of them have been widely supported by their people . Both leaders have attached great importance to India-China relationship and have devoted a lot of energy to grow this relationship . `` Over the past few years they met 10 times , visited each other 's capitals and home towns . They also met at multilateral occasions , '' he said , adding that every time they had very good talks and reached important consensus.At the informal summit , they will have strategic communication on the major changes in the international landscape unseen in more than 100 years.They will have in-depth exchange of views on the issues of overarching long-term and strategic importance in the bilateral relations , he said.Such exchange of views will deepen the mutual trust between the two countries , set the direction and set objectives for the further growth of bilateral ties . It will also open up new prospects in China-India cooperation . Such informal summit will not only benefit the two countries and peoples but will also deliver peace and development in the region and beyond , he said.Over the past few days and months competent authorities of both the countries have carried out intense engagement with each other about the upcoming informal summit to work together for a sound momentum in the India-China relations . `` It is fair to say that this informal summit has already played an important role in driving India-China relations . `` Both sides also agreed that after the summit the two sides will implement important consensus reached at the meeting maintain high level exchanges , have institutional engagements deepen cooperation , properly handle differences , step up multilateral cooperation and coordination so as to ensure that the China-India relationship will see better and fast development at a new starting point , '' he said.Kong said Modi will stay in a most comfortable place in Wuhan . `` The Chinese side will provide some unique arrangements . Some arrangements will go beyond even the expectations of the Indian side , '' he said . `` I ca n't release ( the details ) because of security reasons . The two leaders will spend two days in Wuhan . In this two days , they will engage with other on various forums . What I can tell you here is that they will spend a lot of time together one-on-one , '' he said . `` This kind of one-on-one is not often seen in other countries . Relevant information will be released in a detailed and timely manner , '' he added . `` Leaders in the past met in multilateral occasions , 30 minutes or one hour . Those meetings are important but personally speaking the meetings on the multilateral occasions are more ceremonial meetings , '' he said . `` So in this contest , both Indian and Chinese sides thought about the new format . This time we will make the first attempt to hold the informal summit . I am confident that with the joint efforts of both sides the new format will deliver to the expectations , '' he said .
The Senate on Tuesday condemned the continued xenophobic attacks on Nigerians in South Africa and called on the federal government “ to do more to protect its citizens living in South Africa ” . The chairman , Senate Committee on Diaspora and Non-Governmental Organisations ( NGOs ) , Senator Rose Oko , who addressed the press in her office on behalf of the Senate , regretted that efforts in the past to stop xenophobic attacks in the has not yielded positive result .
Oko , who also highlighted series of efforts by officials of the two countries to curb incidences of xenophobic attacks on Nigerians in South since 2013 , said it however persisted through to 2016 . The senator , who represents Cross River Northern Senatorial District , expressed the displeasure of the Senate over the latest mob killing of Anambra-born Mr Clement Nwaogu , in North West Province of South Africa .
According to her , incidences of “ xenophobic attacks and killing are fuelled by the lack of action by its government to bring perpetrators to book including disciplining its rogue law enforcement agents as well as utterances by prominent South Africans against foreigners in their country . ”
Senator Oko said , “ It has been reported that yet another Nigerian , Clement Nwaogu , from Anambra State living in South Africa and involved in upholstery business was attacked and killed by a mob in Rustenburg , North West Province . His crime ostensibly being his accent and habit which the mob found offensive . They were said to have descended on him like a common criminal in the presence of the South African police officers who reportedly did not respond to all entreaties to help him . Eventually , as he ran from the scene , he was chased and set ablazed . ”
She opined that , the incidence of xenophobic attacks and extra judicial killings of foreigners , most especially Nigerians has continued to be on the rise notwithstanding actions taken by both Governments to stem the tide . In 2013 , an MoU was signed by both governments to curb the incidence of xenophobia . The attacks however persisted through 2016 . After a series of attacks in early 2017 both Governments agreed on early warning mechanisms . In my interface with the Minister of Foreign Affairs , he was optimistic that this will ameliorate the situation . However , the efforts of 2013 and 2017 obviously have not yielded the desired result in protecting the lives of Nigerians in South Africa .
“ Furthermore , it is to be noted that there are currently 14 Nigerians still in detention when they protested against extra judicial killing of Nigerians in February this year , while the police officers involved have since been released on bail . She added that , It is also to be noted that apparently xenophobic attacks and extra judicial killings in South Africa is being fuelled by the lack of action by its government to bring perpetrators to book including disciplining its rogue law enforcement agents as well as utterances by prominent South Africans against foreigners in their country . For instance , in 2015 , the Zulu king was said to have called all foreigners to leave the country . This resulted in violent xenophobic attacks .
“ While we dont hold brief for Nigerians who do not obey the laws of the country , meting out jungle justice is against all known International , Regional and National statutes that enshrine basic and fundamental human rights to life and the right to fair hearing . The Nigerian government must do more to protect her citizens in South Africa . “ The African Union must be involved as xenophobia is indeed against foreigners especially those from Africa . Nigeria must urge the South African government to prosecute perpetrators of these acts . Nigeria must adopt a tougher stance including considering the present cordial relations with South Africa .
“ We must also urgently look inward and find a solution to the mass movement of Nigerian youths to other parts of the world notwithstanding the dangers that they face , over there . ”

It 's 2017 and Zendaya is here to slay all day .
The Disney kid turned Internet darling turned leading lady has already left her mark on the summer with her low-key turn as Michelle in `` Spider-Man : Homecoming . '' And she has stayed in the spotlight thanks to her social activism and red-carpet looks .
Zendaya 's latest head-turning effort is in Bruno Mars ' new video for `` Versace on the Floor , '' in which she plays the sultry 20-year-old pseudo-love interest of 31-year-old Mars .
Zendaya and Mars portray two strangers in adjoining hotel rooms ( or , judging by the decor , adjoining hotel ballrooms ) who exchange a look in the hallway before entering their respective rooms .
Mars then sits down at what appears to be a Lucite piano that Liberace would have deemed tacky and croons about how they should get naked , i.e. , leaving that expensive Versace dress on the floor .

Agriculture Cabinet Secretary Mwangi Kiunjuri maintains that no money was lost in the National Cereals and Produce Board ( NCPB ) maize scandal even as he admitted that most of the 9 billion shillings set aside to buy maize from farmers benefitted traders .
Kiunjuri also tabled an audit report of maize depots that implicates 23 traders who supplied 1.6 million bags and pocketed over 1.5 billion shillings . The agriculture ministry is now expected to inspect all silos to verify the value of the 60 million bags of maize in their stocks .
National assembly 's agriculture committee invited agriculture cabinet secretary Mwangi Kiunjuri to explain measures the ministry had instituted to contain corruption at national cereals board .
Kiunjuri told MPs that three regional managers of depots where NCPB officials colluded with unscrupulous traders to deny farmers a chance to sell their produce had been suspended pending investigations .

59 other officers from the cereals and produce board are also under investigation .
According to the cabinet secretary , unscrupulous NCPB officials circumvented guidelines and bought maize brought from neighboring countries .
The cabinet secretary also tabled an audit report of the controversial maize depots which implicated 23 traders who failed vetting despite supplying 1.6million bags of maize and earned 1.5 billion shillings .
Kiunjuri however assured genuine farmers yet to be paid , that will get their dues .
The Agriculture CS failed to name the prominent players allegedly behind the big suppliers mentioned in the report before the house committee , challenging the Director of Criminal Investigations and the ethics and anti-corruption commission to pick up the issue and unearth the people behind the supplies .
The Obama Administration used the Affordable Care Act to engage in cultural imperialism .
The way-too-rigid contraception mandate is a case in point . Rather than respecting a broad societal comity by permitting easy religious exemptions–such as , say , allowing an order of Catholic nuns to opt-out–Obamacare technocrats tried to force non-profits and business owners to violate their own faith as a cost of doing business or acting in the pubic square .
DOJ legal briefs also argued that the expansive mandate was necessary to promote the equality of women in the business arena–which is not the purpose of health insurance .
( The contraception issue was a stalking horse for abortion , about which , I have no doubt , Obamacarians would have mandated coverage had they remained in power . )
This led to what could be called “ resistance ” and court rulings , including at SCOTUS , that did not go well for the Obamacare attempted hegemony .
Perhaps more importantly from a political perspective , the hard mandate helped fuel the public 's rage against the law , helping propel the Republican party into power by promising lying that once in office , elected officials would ” repeal and replace , ” the law .
In any event , pieces of Obamacare are being dismantled despite Republican dysfunction . The Obamacare contraception mandate is now significantly weakened . From the Washington Times story :
The Trump administration said Friday it will let a vast universe of employers ducks Obamacare 's contraceptive mandate by claiming a religious or moral objection , a long-awaited move that will enthuse pro-life conservatives and enrage advocates who say women 's rights to birth control are being threatened . Under the new regulation , employers who assert a good-faith objection to having their insurance plans pay for contraception will be exempt so long as they notify their employees of the change , the Health and Human Services Department said . Until now , religiously affiliated charities and family-owned companies had to sign a form saying they did n't want to provide coverage , triggering a process where someone else would step in and offer coverage for free contraception . The Trump administration said colleges , faith-based nonprofits and for-profit companies can now avoid the mandate by claiming a religious or moral objection instead of submitting the paperwork , while publicly traded companies must pinpoint a religious objection to claim an exemption .
There is a valuable lesson to be learned here for DC politicos and their bureaucrat minions . But I doubt they will .
MANDI BAHAUDDIN/RAHIM YAR KHAN-District police in defiance of the rules are not treating the public on equality basis , as the poor having no political backing , are denied justice by the policemen who side with the wealthy and influential perpetrators , various victims alleged here on Sunday .
Frequent claims made by the government and police high-ups to have changed police culture and reformed the policing system are false .
Two days ago Bushra Parveen was present at her rented flat situated on Old Rasul Road . Her husband Khurram Shahzad was away on work . One Umar Hayat who deals in gold entered the flat and allegedly raped the lady . In the meantime , Khurram arrived and he saw the accused leaving the flat half naked . The lady reported the incident to civil lines police station but no legal action was taken against the accused .
She went to DPO office but he was not present . The lady reported the matter to PSO to the DPO who told her that civil lines police would contact her in an hour . Next day , she went to police Chowki Sufi City where In Charge Chowki told her he was busy and had no time to attend her . Reason behind not registering case is that the accused is wealthy and had political backing , she said .
In another case wife and daughter of grave digger Manzoor were present at their house in Gojra village while Manzoor had gone out on work . In the meantime , some gangsters belonging to influential families entered the house and attempted to rape the women .
The women resisted and made hue and cry listening to which the villagers from neighbouring houses reached . Seeing them , the accused fled away , leaving a pistol behind . The incident was reported to Gojra Police but no case has so far been registered .
On the other side , Rahim Yar Khan police have registered a case against a Pakistan People 's Party leader on the charges of making a person hostage for two weeks in Sadiqabad .

| WASHINGTON
WASHINGTON The Federal Reserve raised interest rates on Wednesday for the second time in three months and said it would begin cutting its holdings of bonds and other securities this year , signalling its confidence in a growing U.S. economy and strengthening job market.In lifting its benchmark lending rate by a quarter percentage point to a target range of 1.00 percent to 1.25 percent and forecasting one more hike this year , the Fed seemed to largely brush off a recent run of mixed economic data.The U.S. central bank 's rate-setting committee said the economy had continued to strengthen , job gains remained solid and indicated it viewed a recent softness in inflation as largely transitory.The Fed also gave a first clear outline on its plan to reduce its $ 4.2 trillion portfolio of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities , most of which were purchased in the wake of the 2007-2009 financial crisis and recession.It expects to begin the normalization of its balance sheet this year , gradually ramping up the pace . The plan , which would feature halting reinvestments of ever-larger amounts of maturing securities , did not specify the overall size of the reduction . `` What I can tell you is that we anticipate reducing reserve balances and our overall balance sheet to levels appreciably below those seen in recent years but larger than before the financial crisis , '' Fed Chair Janet Yellen said in a press conference following the release of the Fed 's policy statement.She added that the balance sheet normalization could be put into effect `` relatively soon . `` The initial cap for the reduction of the Fed 's Treasuries holdings would be set at $ 6 billion per month , increasing by $ 6 billion increments every three months over a 12-month period until it reached $ 30 billion per month .
For agency debt and mortgage-backed securities , the cap will be $ 4 billion per month initially , rising by $ 4 billion at quarterly intervals over a year until it reached $ 20 billion per month.U.S . stocks edged lower and prices of U.S. Treasuries pared gains after the Fed 's policy statement . The dollar .DXY was largely flat against a basket of currencies after reversing earlier losses , while the price of gold fell . `` The Fed announcing an update to their reinvestment principles leaves September open ( for ) the start of balance sheet runoff , and the fact that they have n't slowed their projected path of rate hikes suggest they can do both balance sheet and rate hikes at the same time , '' said Gennadiy Goldberg , interest rate strategist at TD Securities.EYES ON INFLATION
The Fed has now raised rates four times as part of a normalization of monetary policy that began in December 2015 . The central bank had pushed rates to near zero in response to the financial crisis . Fed policymakers also released their latest set of quarterly economic forecasts , which showed only temporary concern about inflation and continued confidence about economic growth in the coming years.They forecast U.S. economic growth of 2.2 percent in 2017 , an increase from the previous projection in March . Inflation was expected to be at 1.7 percent by the end of this year , down from the 1.9 percent previously forecast.A retreat in inflation over the past two months has caused jitters that the shortfall , if sustained , could alter the pace of future rate hikes . But the Fed maintained its forecast for three rate hikes next year .
The Fed 's preferred measure of underlying inflation has retreated to 1.5 percent , from 1.8 percent earlier this year , and has run below the central bank 's 2 percent target for more than five years.Earlier on Wednesday , the Labor Department reported consumer prices unexpectedly fell in May , the second drop in three months.Yellen indicated the Fed still remained confident inflation would rise to its target over the medium term , bolstered by what she described as a robust labour market that is continuing to strengthen.The Fed 's estimates for the unemployment rate by the end of this year moved down to 4.3 percent , the current level , and to 4.2 percent in 2018 , indicating the Fed believes the labour market will continue to tighten.The median estimate of the long-run neutral rate , which is seen as the level of monetary policy that neither boosts nor slows the economy , was unchanged at 3.0 percent.Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari dissented in Wednesday 's decision .

ISLAMABAD : CJCSC Hayat called on Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif , and said Pakistan 's armed forces are fully committed to eliminate terrorism from the country with the help of civilian security agencies . The nation is still determined to eliminate terrorism from Pakistan . Homage was paid to the police officials who lost their lives in the attack .
During the meeting , they discussed introducing a development programme for armed forces , along with other strategic matters . The Jamaatul Ahrar faction of the outlawed Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan has claimed responsibility for the attack and released a picture of the bomber . Though the claim could not be verified independently , the man in the picture released by the group bears resemblance to the one seen by investigators in the CCTV footage .
Investigators from the Counterterrorism Department ( CTD ) , Crime Scene Unit , Punjab Forensic Science Agency and other law enforcement agencies investigated the crime scene after collecting vital forensic evidence on Tuesday .
According to Ahmad Raza ( emergency official ) , among the 15 people killed in the Lahore blast , six were police officers . The toll could have been higher , Raza said , but for two vehicles — a TV news van and a minivan belonging to the protesters — wHich absorbed much of the impact of the blast .
MAPUSA : Assonora gram sabha , on Sunday , witnessed heated arguments on almost all issues , which came up for discussion . The situation turned worst when a gram sabha member made allegations that illegal vote bank is being created in the village . And , so police personnel had to be called to control the situation .
The gram sabha was attended by a large number of villagers , being the first gram sabha of the newly-elected panchayat body .
The secretary Rajkumar Chodankar read out the minutes of the last gram sabha . Some villagers took a strong note of the financial discrepancies mentioned in the audit report of 2015-16 , and objected to its passing .
The meeting was presided over by sarpanch Pravin Budge in presence of deputy sarpanch Shailesh Salgaonkar and other panch members . The observer for the meeting was Kashinath Pednekar .
Later , a villager Lawrence Fernandes suggested to the sarpanch to convene a special meeting to discuss the financial discrepancies mentioned in the report .
And , soon Budge assured the villagers that a special meeting will be convened , and all records will be made available for the villagers to scrutinise .
A villager Ashok Banaulikar brought to the notice of gram sabha that in one of ward around 50-60 voters are excising voting rights but they are not the villagers .
He alleged that an illegal vote bank has been created to win the election with the help of booth-level officer by a local politician .
Replying to allegation , Budge said that the matter does not come under the purview of the panchayat , as “ we do n't issue election cards , and hence we can not do anything in the matter and right authority is the State Election Commission . ”
Due to the code of conduct in force no development work can be taken up , still the villagers made suggestions , saying the works could be taken up after the code is withdrawn .
A villager Rajesh Madkaikar suggested to the sarpanch sending a proposal to KTC with regards to Assonora bus stand hall , mentioning that “ this hall is built in the village , but the rent is high . Hence panchayat should write to the KTC to give 50 per cent concession to the locals . ”
Commenting on the garbage generated from bus stand project , which is dumped on the rear side , sarpanch assured that he will study the matter and work out a solution .
Later , it was announced that four committees will be formed namely village development committee , child welfare committee , road and traffic safety committee and biodiversity committee , and yet again gram sabha members got into arguments among themselves , and soon the sarpanch intervened and situation was brought under control .
Budge asked about the opinion of the gram sabha as regards to the re-assessment of house tax , and said that “ for the last 14 years the house tax structure has not been revised , and panchayat needs to reassess it so that the panchayat revenue increases and matching grants can be received . ”
The villagers in principle agreed to hike the house tax by 8 per cent , and demanded that illegal houses should be regularised so that even their tax can be collected . The issue of the construction of a building near the bus stand was also raised , and the panchayat was asked to be vigilant as “ the builders , who are politicians may indulge in illegal constructions . ”
The issue of Mahindra project was again raised . And , the villagers demanded a PowerPoint presentation over the project .

While 2017 was a banner year for plant-based eating—with plant-based burgers and other alternative proteins coming to market—2018 began with headlines proclaiming a new year filled with meat . The U.S. Department of Agriculture sparked these stories by predicting that Americans will eat a record amount of beef , pork and poultry this year .
The meaty headlines—complete with pictures of burgers and steaks—are n't necessarily wrong , but they do n't tell the whole story . Even while total U.S. per capita consumption of meat has crept up over the past five decades , the mix of meats Americans eat has shifted dramatically , with the share of beef declining . Because eating lots of meat—especially beef—will make it harder to feed a growing global population while meeting key Sustainable Development Goals on climate , forests and water , it 's important to recognize the subtleties in the changing U.S. diet .
A more sustainable American diet , even with lots of meat
Per capita U.S. beef consumption peaked in the 1970s and has since declined by about one-third , according to USDA data on food availability . “ Availability ” measures food production and then adjusts for trade to show how much food is available at the retail level , providing a decent proxy for domestic food consumption . Pork consumption stayed relatively constant over the same period , while consumption of chicken more than doubled . All told , 2018 could well be another record year of U.S. chicken consumption . While some assert that “ beef will always be king ” in America , the data show this has n't been the case since around 1990 , and wo n't be in 2018 either .
While swapping out beef for chicken in diets can be problematic for animal welfare—more animals eaten overall , often raised in more crowded conditions—it does reduce pressure on the global environment . Beef production requires about seven times more land and emits seven times more greenhouse gases as chicken per gram of protein . ( A shift toward plant-based foods would be even better for the environment : beef production is 20 times as land- and greenhouse gas-intensive as beans , for example . )
Between this beef-to-chicken trend and steady improvement in American farming efficiency , U.S. individual dietary footprints are likely lower now than they were 50 years ago . Indeed , the NRDC estimated that from 2005 to 2014 alone , total U.S. diet-related greenhouse gas emissions fell by about 10 percent , mostly due to a 17 percent decline in beef consumption during that decade . Per capita beef consumption has since inched back upward to levels last seen in 2010 , but it remains far lower than its peak .
Changes in preferences , production and prices
What 's behind this enormous shift from beef to chicken consumption ? Beef industry-funded research from 2009 points to a combination of health concerns ( for example , links between fat consumption and heart disease ) , an increase in women in the workforce ( because women were often the ones who did the cooking at home and beef can take longer than chicken to prepare ) , and increased availability of ready-to-cook chicken products . More recent USDA research cites increases in chicken production , as well as production efficiency , leading to more chicken on the market over time—and a lower retail price for chicken than beef , possibly encouraging consumers to make the swap .
Prices and production patterns may also explain the recent rebound in total per capita U.S. meat consumption—particularly beef consumption—since 2014 . According to Rabobank , the primary driver for the downturn in meat consumption from 2005 to 2014 was high meat prices relative to consumer incomes , although consumers ' changing preferences for more plant-based foods and less meat may have also played a part . The Great Recession lowered incomes , and rising feed prices—along with other factors—led to a decrease in meat production and an increase in the price of meat . With the recession now over , feed prices back down and meat production back up , one might expect U.S. meat consumption patterns to bounce back to previous highs—unless consumer preferences really have changed .
Toward a sustainable food future
Beef is no longer “ king ” among meats in the U.S. diet , but it remains the most environmentally consequential food we eat , accounting for nearly half of Americans ' dietary footprint . And while U.S. per capita beef consumption is down from its peak , it 's still higher than almost anywhere else in the world and four times as high as the world average . At the global level , beef production and consumption continues to rise as incomes rise across the developing world . Researchers have shown that without further decreases in beef consumption in high-consuming countries , it will be extremely difficult to limit global warming to 2 degrees C ( 3.6 degrees F ) above pre-industrial levels—which is needed to ward off the worst impacts of climate change—even when assuming additional advances in agricultural efficiency and productivity .
More efforts are necessary to accelerate the shift to a more sustainable American diet , with a greater share of plant-based foods . Luckily , as the data above show , large shifts in consumption patterns are possible in just a generation 's time . If the next wave of plant-based foods and plant-forward meals can compete with all meats like chicken did with beef—on important consumer attributes like taste , price , convenience , and nutrition—we could be at the start of a very important dietary transition .
Later this year , as part of our final “ Creating a Sustainable Food Future ” report , WRI will release new modeling that shows just how much national and global diets need to shift toward plant-based foods by 2050 to feed a population of nearly 10 billion within environmental limits . We 'll also publish insights from our Better Buying Lab showing how food companies can use marketing and behavioral science to enable consumers to select more healthy and sustainable meals . Stay tuned !

“ The party agreed with the recommendation and the individuals in question will not be able to cast a ballot because of their incomplete application . ”
2 . We have handled all issues with membership applications rapidly , strictly , and by the book . We informed each campaign of their number of forms not accepted , and the reasons for those decisions . # bclib18 # bcpoli — Emile Scheffel ( @ Emile_BC ) February 2 , 2018
B.C . Liberal Party executive director Emile Scheffel said the party 's inspection of new memberships included checking email addresses . He issued a statement Friday that does not clarify if other campaigns had similar issues .
“ In any case where the party was not satisfied that an email address was the applicant 's own as required by the rules , those applications were not accepted , ” Scheffel said . “ Based on that process , we are confident that only those membership applications that have met all of the party 's criteria for membership , including those applications submitted by the Todd Stone campaign , have been accepted . ”
Moscow : President Vladimir Putin flew into Syria and ordered “ a significant part ” of Moscow 's military contingent there to start withdrawing on Monday , declaring their work largely done .
Putin , who polls show will be re-elected comfortably in March , made the announcement during a surprise visit to Russia 's Hmeymim air base in Syria - his first since Russia intervened in the conflict . He held talks with President Bashar al-Assad and addressed Russian forces .
The first leg in a three-country one-day whirlwind diplomatic visit which sees Putin also meeting his Egyptian and Turkish counterparts , Putin is keen to leverage the heightened Middle East influence that Syria has given him to cast himself as a leader who can do diplomacy as well as military force .
The Kremlin first launched air strikes in Syria in September 2015 in its biggest Middle East intervention in decades , turning the tide of the conflict in Assad 's favour . Now that it regards that mission complete , Putin wants to help broker a peace deal .
“ In just over two years , Russia 's armed forces and the Syrian army have defeated the most battle-hardened group of international terrorists , ” Putin told Russian servicemen .
A “ significant part ” of the Russian force could now return home . “ The conditions for a political solution under the auspices of the United Nations have been created , ” said Putin . “ The Motherland awaits you . ”
Washington was sceptical about Putin 's statement .
“ Russian comments about removal of their forces do not often correspond with actual troop reductions , and do not affect U.S. priorities in Syria , ” said Pentagon spokesman Eric Pahon .
Putin made clear in any case that Russia would retain enough firepower to destroy any possible Islamic State comeback .
Syrian state television quoted Assad as thanking Putin for Russia 's help , saying the blood of Moscow 's “ martyrs ” had been mixed with the blood of the Syrian army . It also showed the two men watching what it called a victory parade with Russian troops dressed in desert uniforms marching past .
Russia 's main contribution has been air strikes , and with Iran-backed Shi'ite militias doing much of the fighting on the ground , the partial Russian withdrawal may not make a huge difference when it comes to the military situation .
Russia 's campaign , which has been extensively covered on state TV at home , has not caught the imagination of most Russians . But nor has it stirred unease of the kind the Soviet Union faced with its calamitous 1980s Afghanistan intervention .
The use of private military contractors , something which has been documented by Reuters but denied by the defence ministry , has allowed Moscow to keep the public casualty toll fairly low .
Officially , less than 50 Russian service personnel have been killed in the campaign , but the real number , including private contractors , is estimated to be much higher .
Electoral boost ?
Russia 's “ mission accomplished ” moment in Syria may help Putin increase the turnout at the March presidential election by appealing to the patriotism of voters .
Though polls show he will easily win , they also show that some Russians are increasingly apathetic about politics , and Putin 's supporters are keen to get him re-elected on a big turnout , which in their eyes confers legitimacy .
Putin , who with the help of state TV has dominated Russia 's political landscape for the last 17 years , told Russian servicemen they would return home as victors .
Speaking in front of a row of servicemen holding Russian flags , Putin said his military had proved its might and that Moscow had succeeded in keeping Syria intact as a “ sovereign independent state . ”
“ I congratulate you ! ” Putin told the servicemen .
Putin is keen to organise a special event in Russia — the Syrian Congress on National Dialogue — that Moscow hopes will bring together the Syrian government and opposition and try to hammer out a new constitution .
When asked about Putin 's announcement , Yahya Aridi , spokesman for the Syrian opposition in Geneva , said it welcomed any step that brought Syria closer to real peace .
Putin made clear however that while Russia might be drawing down much of its forces , its military presence in Syria was a permanent one and that it would retain enough firepower to destroy any Islamic State comeback .
Russia will keep its Hmeymim air base in Syria 's Latakia Province and its naval facility in the Syrian Mediterranean port of Tartous “ on a permanent basis , ” said Putin .
Both bases are protected by sophisticated air defence missile systems .
Putin was told by the military that it had begun withdrawing 25 aircraft , a detachment of Russian military police , a detachment of Russian special forces , a military field hospital and a de-mining centre .
However , Russia has announced partial force draw-downs before only to later bring in different capabilities .
“ We 've seen such announcements before , which turn about to be less significant than they might have initially appeared , ” said one European diplomat who declined to be named .
“ The most significant contribution Russia can make to advancing peace in Syria is to pressure the Assad regime to engage seriously in Geneva ( peace talks ) . Absent that , the suspicion will be that this announcement may have more to do with Russian politics than the Syrian situation . ”
Views from Srinagar
Gulzar Bhat
Before 1990 , Kashmir was a sought-after location for Bollywood filmmakers . A plethora of movies had been shot in the valley particularly since 1960 capturing the spell-casting beauty of Kashmir . While most of these movies showcased the beauty of Kashmir , only a few reflected the rich Kashmiri culture and tradition .
In 1964 Shakti Samanta 's directed film Kashmir Ki Kali staring Shami Kapoor and Sharmila Tagore depicted the mesmerizing beauty of Kashmir . The song sequences on the banks of Dal Lake and a string of other events filmed on various locations across the valley portrayed merely the mesmerizing beauty of Kashmir while ignoring the socio-political and cultural aspects of the landscape . In 1965 , Suraj Prakash directorial Jab Jab Phool Khile casting Shashi Kapoor and Nanda was also set in Kashmir . Like Kashmir Ki Kali this film too promoted the beauty of Kashmir , barring a few sequences where Prakash has made stabs at highlighting some of the aspects of Kashmiri culture . By and large , the movie vis- a- vis Kashmir was all about the breathtaking beauty of vale—the exquisite mountains , beautiful houseboats , shikars , mighty chinars etc. , shown through the camera of ace cinematographer Taru Dutt .
Another movie directed by Manmohan Krishna , Noori produced in 1979 featuring Farooq Sheikh and Poonam Dhillion filmed in the valley of Baderwah also captured the snowcapped mountains lush green forests and the pristine springs of the landscape . The movie was no way an exception from the previous Bollywood compositions .
Post 1990 Movies
Militancy broke out in Kashmir in 1990 and since its inception Bollywood shifted its focus from portraying Kashmir as a beautiful landscape to a conflict ridden society . Although Bollywood filmmakers ceased to shoot movies in Kashmir for quite some time ( mostly from 1990-1995 ) , Kashmir conflict continued to remain a dominant theme in Indian cinema . The movies produced during this period depicted the motivation behind the Kashmiri youth picking up the arms , incidents involving the violence and gore , mass exodus of Kashmiri Pandit community so on and so forth . During this phase a rather biased approach was adopted by most of the writers and directors of Bollywood in showcasing the Kashmir conflict to set the cash registers ringing . However , there were some non-partisan directorial attempts made after 2000 that provided some valuable insights into the Kashmir conflict .
In 1992 , Roja , a Maniratnam directorial was the first attempt by any Bollywood director to portray Kashmir conflict . The movie was originally made in Tamil language and was later , given its popularity , dubbed in Hindi .
Roja miserably failed to reflect the cause behind the Kashmiri youth joining the militant ranks en-masse . Hardly any attempt was made to highlight the aspirations of the people of Kashmir in the backdrop of history , culture , religion and geography . Indian security forces were shown as the survivors of local populace ignoring the violence perpetrated by them .
In 2000 while the state backed counter insurgency was at its peak in valley , Mission Kashmir , a new Bollywood flick by Vidhu Vinod Chopra representing Kashmir conflict hit the screens across India .
Known for swimming against the tide in Bollywood , Chopra tried to depict the long-drawn-out Kashmir conflict on silver screen through Mission Kashmir . The movie has portrayed the vulnerabilities of the people living in a conflict zone and how they are caught—more often than not—unsuspected between two conflicting parties . Mission Kashmir has also revealed the bitter truth about the children of Kashmir suffering from Post-traumatic Stress Disorders after they lose their family members to bullets .
Although Chopra zoomed the cameras in on Kashmir conflict , he remained selective in depicting it . Mission Kashmir was made at a time when state backed militant groups had unleashed a reign of terror among the local populace , but no attention was paid towards this stark reality in the entire conflict-dominated story line .
After Mission Kashmir , in 2005 Bollywood director Shoojit Sircar came up with Yahaan featuring Kashmir conflict . Yahaan could be considered as Sircar 's first stab at unknotting some of the minuscule realities of the Kashmir conflict . The story is recounted through an inter-cast relationship between a Hindu Captain and a Muslim girl caught up in two political ideologies : one representing the idea of India and the other pro-freedom sentiment .
The movie has successfully brought to light the bad behavior of Indian army in Kashmir and has displayed how one can not raise voice against such behavior even within the ranks of army . And one who has the gumption to do so has to pay a heavy price . Although there is not a grain of doubt that women have borne the brunt of conflict in Kashmir , the way Adda 's ( Minissha Lamba 's ) character was created is way far from reality .
Vishal Bardawaj 's magnum opus Haider was another film by a Bollywood director to depict the Kashmir conflict . Haider was the first movie that succeeded in presenting a true picture of valley and went beyond the worn-out stance of earlier Bollywood filmmakers on Kashmir . Bardhawaj along with his co-writer Basharat Peer truthfully highlighted the pain and agony of people living in the hideous conflict zone of Kashmir .
Haider is set in 1995 . It was the year when people were picked by army and other security agencies arbitrarily on mere suspicion in Kashmir . Enforced disappearances were a routine affair .
Haider has succeeded in depicting this rather dismal picture of Kashmir . It has drawn attention towards the draconian laws like AFSPA . The director has also walked an extra mile to highlight the machinations of scheming politicians . Haider serves as a grim reminder of pain and agony that people in the valley experienced through nineties .
Most of the Bollywood directors in their commercial movies have preferred to stick to the official stand of India on Kashmir while ignoring the political and historical facts . They eulogized the prowess of Indian security establishment and bashed the neighboring country for all the mess in valley . Only a few baby steps vis-à-vis depicting Kashmir conflict on silver screen were taken where “ a spade was called a spade ” .

TV One Does Dinner for Two
Another TV One movie called Dinner for Two is currently in production in Atlanta . R & B singer Tristan “ Mack ” Wilds ( The Wire , 90210 ) , Chaley Rose ( Nashville ) , Shaun Baker ( House Party , Living Single ) and Prince Hammond star in the story of an alcoholic reflecting on his life and his lost relationship with a woman he still loves while he guzzles wine and whiskey . Orlando Bishop wrote the story and is directing .
BERLIN , Dec 10 ( Reuters ) - Troubled international retail conglomerate Steinhoff , whose shares plunged last week after disclosing accounting problems , said on Sunday it had appointed two advisory firms ahead of a meeting with lenders on Dec. 19 .
The South African company said it has appointed U.S. investment bank Moelis & Co to advise the company on talks with its lenders , and has asked management consultancy AlixPartners “ to assist on liquidity management and operational measures ” .
More than $ 14 billion was wiped off the market value of the Johannesburg and Frankfurt-listed group last week after it announced it was ordering an independent investigation into its accounts and said its CEO was leaving .
“ The group is currently fully focussed on safeguarding operational liquidity to continue funding existing operations throughout its various subsidiaries , ” the company said on Sunday .
“ In this context , the group is asking for and requires continued support in relation to existing facilities from all its lenders to achieve an immediate stabilisation of the group 's financing , ” it added in a statement .
On Friday the company had said it was postponing its regular annual lenders ' meeting in London from Dec. 11 to Dec. 19 as a result of it having postponed its financial results pending the outcome of the accounting investigation .
“ The purpose of the meeting will be for the group to provide an update on its ongoing operational and financial situation . An agenda for the meeting will be circulated ahead of 19 December 2017 , ” the company said on Sunday . ( Reporting by Maria Sheahan ; Editing by Greg Mahlich )
Lakers guard Lou Williams scored 19 of his 29 points in the fourth quarter Tuesday night , but it was n't enough to offset Sacramento forward DeMarcus Cousins , who scored 16 of his 40 points in the final period and hit the winning free throw with nine seconds left . Here are five things we learned from the Lakers ' 97-96 loss to the Kings in Staples Center .
1 . The Lakers looked a little disorganized , a little frantic , on their last possession , which ended with Williams ' 30-foot heave barely drawing iron at the buzzer , but Coach Luke Walton did n't necessarily want a do-over .
Cousins made the first of two free throws with nine seconds left to give Sacramento a one-point lead , and he missed the second , with Williams corralling the rebound along the baseline . The Lakers had two 20-second timeouts remaining and could have huddled to set up a play , but Walton let them play on .
Williams dribbled across midcourt and , while drifting to his right , threw up a shot from just in front of the Lakers bench that was well off the mark .
“ If he made [ the second free throw ] we would have taken a timeout , ” Walton said . “ With a miss , especially when I saw Lou come up with the ball , anything we drew up was gon na be for him at that moment anyway .
“ I 've seen enough basketball in my experience that if you get the guy you want with the ball in his hands and you can not allow a defense to get set , good things can happen . …
“ I like letting it go , see if in the chaos he can break away and come up with a shot . He 's not gon na get a wide-open look no matter what we draw up for him , so he 's going to have to make a challenging shot , either way . ”
2 . The Lakers had no antidote for the 6-foot-11 , 270-pound Cousins , who , in addition to his 40 points grabbed 12 rebounds and had eight assists . Cousins made 13 of 24 shots from the field and 12 of 19 from the free-throw line .
Lakers center Tarik Black fouled out in only 21 minutes guarding Cousins . Timofey Mozgov , Ivica Zubac , Larry Nance Jr. and Julius Randle each took turns on Cousins , with little luck .
“ He 's an Star-caliber player , the best player on that team , one of the best bigs in the league , ” Williams said . “ He did everything he was supposed to do tonight . ”
3 . Williams ' name has popped up in trade rumors , and it 's easy to see why . The reserve guard is a prolific scorer , as he showed again Tuesday night , fueling a fourth-quarter run in which the Lakers erased a 13-point deficit in the final 10 minutes .
The Lakers trailed , 79-66 , with 9 minutes , 46 seconds left , but Williams scored 14 of the team 's next 25 points , including a 26-footer from the top of the key with 1:45 left that tied the score , 91-91 .
Williams actually stepped on Darren Collison 's foot before the shot , nearly stumbling while the defender fell down , but Williams regained his balance , elevated and made the clutch shot .
“ I just hoop , and I let the powers that be dealt with that , ” Williams , who is averaging a team-high 18.4 points , said of the trade rumors . “ I 'm a little old-school in my approach . I play for the team that I have the jersey on for . I do n't really deal with hypotheticals , so if something happens , it happens , if it does n't , it does n't , and I 'm gon na compete for the Lakers . ”
4 . Just because you start the game for the Lakers , that does n't mean you 'll finish it . Neither Randle , a forward , nor point guard D'Angelo Russell played in the fourth quarter , while Williams , Jordan Clarkson , Nick Young , Nance and Luol Deng spurred a Lakers comeback .
“ They earned that chance , ” Walton said of the closing group . “ With the team that we have , we 're gon na try to get experience minutes for these young guys , but we were down by 16 , and that group fought back and gave us a chance to win the game . At that moment , I was rewarding the players that started playing together , bringing that energy , attacking on defense and making plays . ”
5 . Black was credited with the first three-point basket of his career with 3:21 left in the fourth quarter , but that does n't mean the Lakers center is now a three-point threat . With the shot clock expiring , Black found himself with the ball at the top of the key , and his desperation shot was short of the basket .
But Cousins leaped and deflected the ball as it was about to hit the front of the rim , and he was called for goaltending .
Asked if Black is now a three-point weapon , Walton said , “ I hope not . I know that 's the way the NBA is going , but if Tarik starts floating around that three-point line and shooting them , we 're gon na have to have a long talk . But he did recognize the clock . I 'll take that shot over a shot-clock violation . ”

Dave Jones says Hartlepool are United in their fight for Football League survival .
Pools are clinging to life - just one point above League Two 's relegation zone after their winless run was extended to six matches in an abject display at Leyton Orient .
Jones 's side were beaten 2-1 by the crisis club who fielded SEVEN teenagers in their starting XI .
It was an abject display , with second-bottom Newport County 's 6-1 mauling at Plymouth the only consolation .
Three wins from their last three matches would keep Pools up , but it 's difficult to see where the next victory will come from .
Jones admitted he felt let down by the players , but insisted it is a collective responsibility .
“ You have to stand up and be counted and some of them did not do that , ” he said . “ But we are a united dressing room , we are all in it together , every single one of us . That starts with me .
“ I 've not many options I know , but did I pick the right team ? Get the right formation ? Did the players go out and perform ? No .
“ So we are all to blame . We are lucky because the other result went for us .
“ Yes , I feel let down , but we 've all done the letting down . We 've let down the fans . ”
It looks like a two-horse race now for the final relegation spot alongside Leyton Orient , who look doomed despite the win .
Cheltenham and Yeovil both won to boost their survival chances .
It means Pools must produce the goods this Saturday at home to mid-table Barnet .
“ We have to [ get the result ] , ” said Jones . “ We got away with it [ yesterday 's result ] , we wo n't get away with it again . ”
Jones said he was “ shocked ” how Pools let a 1-0 lead turn into a 2-1 deficit before half-time .
“ First 15 minutes we were OK , the next 30 minutes we were more than half a yard off the pace , ” he shrugged .
“ Why ? We have to find out and see where we go . ”
South Korea 's LG Display Co Ltd reported its first quarterly operating loss in six years , hit by a sharp drop in panel prices as Chinese rivals flooded the market and sluggish sales of liquid crystal displays for TVs .
SEOUL : South Korea 's LG Display Co Ltd reported its first operating loss in six years , hit by a sharp drop in panel prices as Chinese rivals flooded the market and sluggish sales of liquid crystal displays for TVs .
The investment costs of shifting more production towards building organic light-emitting diode ( OLED ) panels to meet growing demand also weighed on earnings .
`` The market situation has changed more rapidly than expected , '' Don Kim , CFO of LG Display , said in a statement .
`` We will be focusing on efficient and flexible management in capital expenditure and maintaining operational performance including intensified cost reduction . ''
The Apple Inc supplier posted an operating loss of 98 billion won ( US $ 91 million ) for January-March . That compares with a 1 trillion won profit in the same period a year ago and an average forecast of a 58.1 billion won loss drawn from 14 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S .
Revenue fell 19.6 percent to 5.7 trillion won .

Chinese panel makers , bolstered by government subsidies , have ramped up production and caused panel prices to drop even further , analysts have said . Key LCD panel prices are estimated to have fallen between 6 percent and 10 percent in the first quarter , they added .
Concerns about a glut in the market have driven LG Display shares down about 17 percent so far this year .
CFO Don Kim said LG Display 's panel area shipments are expected to grow from the current quarter , as consumers are expected to want bigger screens for major sporting events .
He also said LCD panel prices are expected to stabilise during the current quarter , while demand for large-size OLED panels is expected to remain strong .

The Duggars love nothing more than planning weddings — and luckily for them , it feels like the family has pretty much been planning weddings nonstop since Jill 's 2014 nuptials . That being said , it 's understandable that even the biggest Counting On fans would need a refresher every now and then on which Duggar is getting married next .
Right now , the Duggar family is only planning one wedding : between Josiah Duggar , 21 , and Lauren Swanson , 18 . They will reportedly tie the knot on Aug. 28 , 2018 , in Springdale , Arkansas , as per a wedding registry on The Knot under their names . Although , with more than four months until their alleged wedding date , it would n't be out of character for another Duggar kid to swoop in and get hitched sometime before the end of August , as most Duggars have a pretty short timeline between courting , their engagement , getting married , and announcing a pregnancy .
For example , Jill and Derick Dillard began courting in March 2014 , he popped the question in April , they were married in June , and they announced a pregnancy in August , all as reported by People . ( Courting is the Duggar family 's super-conservative form of dating with the goal of marriage in mind , with extremely limited physical contact allowed . ) But assuming there are no surprises in the next few months , Josiah will be the next Duggar to walk down the aisle .
TLC on YouTube
Like Josiah , Lauren comes from a large family — she is the oldest of eight children , while Josiah is one of 19 . Because of that , their wedding will take a little more careful planning than some Duggar weddings of the past . When the couple got engaged in early March , Josiah told Us Weekly :
It 's going to be neat to see two great families come together in this union ... It 'll take a lot of planning since we have big families on both sides , but we 're very excited to get started and so thankful for how God has brought our lives together .
Counting On fans are likely less concerned with the actual date of the wedding than they are with the air date of the episode chronicling the wedding . Josiah and Lauren have not yet confirmed if their wedding will be on Counting On . But if the past is any indicator , it 's safe to assume it will be . All other Duggar weddings have been on the show — some of which have even been Counting On season finales , as noted on TLC 's website — so it would be pretty odd if Josiah and Lauren opted out . Not to mention , the couple has already shared their courting announcement as well as their engagement announcement in videos for TLC 's YouTube channel , as well as plenty of Insta selfies , so it 's clear that they are comfortable letting cameras capture their relationship milestones .
While Josiah and Lauren are the only Duggars with a wedding on the horizon , there are plenty of other family milestones just around the corner . Two different Duggar couples are currently expecting their first babies .
Jinger Duggar is expecting her first child , a girl , along with her husband Jeremy Vuolo . On April 6 , Jinger posted on Instagram that she was 25 weeks along . A typical pregnancy lasts about 40 weeks , which means her due date is likely sometime in mid-July .
The other expectant Duggar couple is Joseph Duggar and his wife Kendra Caldwell . Like Jinger and Jeremy , Joseph and Kendra have not disclosed their due date . However , an eagle-eyed fan came across the Amazon baby registry that appears to be Kendra 's , which claims her due date is June 17 , 2018 .
All that being said , it really would n't be a surprise if another Duggar wedding or birth announcement pops up sometime soon . Fans will just have to wait and see !

Paris : Former champion Novak Djokovic reached the French Open third round for the 13th consecutive year by beating Spanish qualifier Jaume Munar 7-6 ( 1 ) , 6-4 , 6-4 on Wednesday .
Djokovic , the 2016 Roland Garros champion and former World No 1 , is seeded 20 this year after struggling to rediscover his best form after returning from a right elbow injury .
He was n't at his best on Court Suzanne Lenglen but goes on to face Spain 's Roberto Bautista Agut for a place in the last 16 .
The Serbian 12-time Grand Slam champion fired 39 winners but 33 unforced errors and was broken three times by Munar , the World No 155 .
`` I am very happy to be here on Suzanne Lenglen and see so many people and see the support , '' said Djokovic .
`` Jaume is a great player , he has lots of quality and good concentration . I congratulate him on a great match today . ''
A group of determined parents have taken matters into their own hands after it was announced that their toddlers ' nursery school was set to close .
Instead of searching for alternative schooling for their children , the never-say-die team have taken over the committee at the Jackroyd Lane-based school and have vowed to keep it going for the sake of the village .
Kids at the school are said to be delighted it will stay open .
Ten committed mums officially took over the pre school 's committee last week and have vowed to keep it alive .
The charge has been led in part by Lydia McGrath , who said that whilst she is under no illusion that there will be challenges ahead , she is delighted that the pre school has been saved .
She said : “ It was n't a case of thinking whether or not to get involved , it was an obvious reaction , certainly from my point of view .
“ We had to step in . Aside from the fact that it 's such a lovely place to bring your children and that the children love it , it 's been open for nearly 30 years and it would have been such a shame for the village to not have it . ”
The initial decision to close the pre-school was a financial one and follows a number of similar closures in West Yorkshire in recent months .
On the new committee , Lydia has taken on the unenviable role of treasurer .
“ We do n't want to run it as a business , ” she said , “ it 's a small , charity , family sort of feel and we want to keep that . We do appreciate that there is a lot we need to do to raise money and recruit children , but this is something that does n't need to make a huge profit .
“ The fact is that for the last two years there has n't been a single parent on the committee . There are so many advantages to not being a commercial nursery . We can run it how we like and that will be about retaining everything good that we have there .
“ We know there are financial obligations we need to address and we 're not pretending it wo n't be challenging . The fact is that we need to find a way of attracting more children to the school . ”
Upper Hopton Pre School have been involved in several community events and Lydia insists that this will continue , with a number of events planned .

Report , Match 3 : Australia captain Aaron Finch revelled in his record-breaking innings against Zimbabwe , saying it was “ up there ” as one of the best innings he has ever played .
Finch powered his way to 172 , beating his own world record high score in Twenty20 Internationals .
Finch and fellow opener D'Arcy Short put on 223 , another world record .
Australia reached 229 for two , the highest total ever scored against Zimbabwe in a T20 international as a slew of records is broken during Australia 's 100-run victory .
`` It 's nice to break my own record , ” said Finch . “ Satisfying . It 's something that I 'll look back on when I 've finished playing and be really proud of . ”
Finch cracked his first six in the fourth over of the morning , and with his third he brought up a 22-ball half century - his fastest in Twenty20 internationals .
Australia took 75 from the Powerplay , with Finch doing the bulk of the scoring while fellow opener D'Arcy Short was content to turn the strike over to his big-hitting partner .
Finch brought up his second T20I hundred at the end of the 14th over , taking just 50 deliveries .
Four overs later , his 15th four took Australia 's score to 200 , and he then moved beyond 150 with a swipe to deep midwicket . He moved beyond the previous world record high score of 156 , which he scored against England in 2013 , with his ninth six .
Short eventually fell swinging across the line at fast bowler Blessing Muzarabani to be caught for 46 , while Finch fell in bizarre circumstances in the final over .
Stretching out to hit a full delivery from Muzarabani , he over-balanced and kicked his own stumps to be out hit wicket .
“ I thought he was going to go with a wide slower ball , so I got back , ” said Finch .
“ I realized out of the hand that it was a touch wide , so I actually went to let it go and probably just did n't realize how far back onto my stumps I got . Disappointing not to be not out at the end . ”
It appeared Zimbabwe might make a fist of their chase when openers Solomon Mire and Chamu Chibhabha rushed past 40 in the fourth over , but once they were dismissed regular wickets quickly stalled the innings .
Left-arm spinner Ashton Agar raced through four overs while conceding just 16 , while Andrew Tye 's seamers were even more effective . He took three for 12 as Australia inflicted one last record against the Zimbabweans , the hosts slumping to their largest ever defeat in T20Is .
Australia have now won two games on the trot following from a disastrous tour of England , and Finch suggested that the change of scenery and opposition had made a big difference .
“ The mood in the camp has always been really positive , and I think coming here we 've brought that confidence that we had , but probably with a bit more self belief coming into a new tournament against two sides that we have n't played for quite a while compared to a team that dominated us last summer in Australia and then did so again .
`` So new opposition and new environment has made a difference here so far . ”
Australia takes on Pakistan on Thursday , and Finch insisted there was no room for complacency .
“ Complacency ? Absolutely not , ” he said .
“ We know Pakistan are a world class side . They 're number one for a reason . They 've got a lot of bases covered , so you 've got to turn up each and every day and be 100 percent against them otherwise they 'll hurt you . ”

Read her announcement below .
Sometimes , when you least expect it , life throws you a curveball . I have recently been diagnosed with a high grade cancer that has metastised , which we frankly did not see coming . A niggling pain led to some tests , which led to this unexpected diagnosis . My family and close friends have rallied around me , providing the best support system that anyone can ask for . I am very blessed and thankful for each of them .
There is no better way to tackle this , than to take swift and immediate action . And so , as advised by my doctors , I am currently undergoing a course of treatment in New York . We remain optimistic and I am determined to fight every step of the way . What has helped has been the immense outpouring of love and support I 've received over the past few days , for which I am very grateful .
We wish the actor a speedy recovery .

“ Happy as Lazzaro , ” a prizewinner at the Cannes Film Festival , has sold widely around the world , including to China , the U.K. , Germany and Spain , following Netflix 's previously announced acquisition of North and Latin American rights .
German sales company The Match Factory has closed deals for more than 20 territories for the time-bending fable about Italy 's transition from a rural society to modernity . The film , directed by Alice Rohrwacher , was a standout in Cannes ' official competition lineup and won the best screenplay award for Rohrwacher ( in a tie with Iran 's Nader Saeivar for “ 3 Faces ” ) .
Set in a pastoral village dominated by a tyrannical tobacco magnate , the fact-inspired story is centered on a meeting between Lazzaro , a young peasant so good he is often mistaken for being simple-minded , and Tancredi , a young nobleman cursed by his imagination . A bond is sealed when Tancredi asks Lazzaro to help him orchestrate his own kidnapping .
Variety critic Guy Lodge called the film a “ tale of a rural innocent defying life 's certainties to bear witness to two separate eras of social and economic exploitation ” and praised it as “ a slow but bewitching burn that rewards viewers ' patience with humor and uncanny grace. ” Lodge said “ Lazzaro ” sealed Rohrwacher 's status “ as a truly distinctive European major , ” following her 2014 Cannes Grand Prix winner “ The Wonders . ”

“ Lazzaro ” was one of only three titles by a female filmmaker out of the 21 Cannes competition titles .
Carlo Cresto-Dina said he would work with Netflix to try to secure a theatrical release in the U.S. , since “ this is a movie that was made to be seen in movie theaters . ”
In its first theatrical outing , “ Lazzaro ” is being released in Italy on Wednesday by Rai Cinema 's 01 distribution on about 120 screens .
“ Happy as Lazzaro ” is an Italy-Switzerland-France-German production . It 's a Tempesta production with Rai Cinema in co-production with Amka Films Prods. , Ad Vitam Production , KNM , Pola Pandora , RSI Radiotelevisione Svizzera , ARTE France Cinéma , and ZDF/ARTE .

CanniMed Therapeutics says it is seeking regulatory action in both Saskatchewan and Ontario in its latest push back against Aurora Cannabis ‘ hostile takeover bid .
The Saskatoon-based medical marijuana producer ( TSX : CMED ) said it has applied to securities regulators in both provinces for several orders , including that Aurora 's hostile offer be considered an “ insider bid , ” and be treated as such .

CanniMed said in a statement that Aurora ( TSX : ACB ) acted jointly with the four institutional shareholders with whom the company secured lock-up agreements amounting to 38 per cent of outstanding shares before commencing its takeover bid , which should be ceased until 105 days after an insider bid circular is delivered to shareholders .
The Saskatoon-based marijuana company is also asking that Financial and Consumer Affairs Authority of Saskatchewan and the Ontario Securities Commission require Aurora to retract and correct what it says are “ several materially false and misleading statements ” in connection with its hostile bid .

Russia 's Federation Council , the Upper House of the Parliament , has invited Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg to speak at one of its plenary meetings , Speaker Valentina Matviyenko said on Wednesday .
`` We have sent an invitation and we will try to organise his arrival , '' Matviyenko was quoted by TASS news agency as saying .
`` Whether he will be able to come is another question , '' she said .
The suggestion to invite Zuckerberg came from Senator Anton Belyakov , who said that the US billionaire might appear at one of the parliamentary `` Hour of the Expert '' events , in which guests normally address the lawmakers and hold a Q & A session .
Matviyenko said that the Federation Council may invite other well-known foreign experts to speak on topical issues .

Justin Thomas capped off a major season that belonged to an aggressive new breed of fearless young Americans when he stormed to a two-stroke victory at the PGA Championship on Sunday.At 24 , he followed in the footsteps of then-23-year-old Jordan Spieth 's British Open triumph and the U.S. Open victory by 27-year-old Brooks Koepka , suggesting a bright future for American golf.Thomas , one of the longest drivers on tour , started the final major of the year ranked 14th in the world , not one of the favourites after recent poor form , but came through by executing under pressure as many of his rivals withered . `` I just had an unbelievable calmness throughout the week , throughout the day , '' Thomas said after lifting the Wanamaker Trophy . `` I really truly felt I was going to win . I was just very confident . I did n't get flustered . `` I was a lot more calm than I thought I would be . I thought I would be very shaky . At one point I looked at my hand it was a little shaky but that 's why you play . `` The serenity served Thomas well after a slow start , as he bided his time before vaulting to the front with four birdies in a sizzling seven-hole stretch mid-round.He then held firm over the dangerous final water-lined three holes , known as the 'Green Mile ' , hoisting a seven-iron to 15-foot at the par-three 17th before sinking the putt to all but secure victory , a bogey at the last academic as he carded 68 to finish at eight-under 276 . `` That was probably one of the best shots I 've ever had to a pin that was really brutal , '' Thomas said of his tee shot at 17 . `` I needed to make par . I 'll never forget that vision in my head ( and ) to make a birdie there was beyond a bonus . `` Thomas was one of five players tied for the lead early on the back nine , before he broke clear with an unlikely 40-foot chip-in birdie at the par-three 13th.He celebrated wildly , pumping his fists , perhaps sensing it was a pivotal moment . `` That chip-in on 13 was probably the most berserk I 've ever been on the golf course , '' he said.As Thomas celebrated , others wondered what might have been , as fellow American Patrick Reed ( 67 ) bogeyed the last to finish equal second with Italian Francesco Molinari ( 67 ) and South African Louis Oosthuizen ( 70 ) .Hideki Matsuyama , seeking to become the first man from Japan to win a major , held the lead briefly mid-round before fading with three consecutive bogeys from the 11th.He carded 72 and finished three shots behind with American Rickie Fowler ( 67 ) .Overnight leader Kevin Kisner ( 74 ) finished four shots back.Thomas , after sinking a 35-foot birdie at the ninth , picked up another shot to tie for the lead at the par-five 10th , where his eight-foot putt stopped on the lip of the cup.Almost apoplectic with frustration , he wisely took his time walking to the ball , which after remaining stationary for 12 seconds toppled in . `` I acted like a child and threw a little tantrum and then it went in so I did n't look so bad , '' Thomas said . `` I did a little fit and gravity took over . `` Two hours later he was celebrating victory . `` Major champion will never be taken away from my name , '' he said .

The B.C . government is offering emergency grants of $ 1,500 for eligible small businesses affected by wildfires in the B.C . Interior .
Forests Minister Doug Donaldson announced Monday the grants will be administered through the Red Cross , which has also distributed $ 600 payments to individuals and families forced from their homes by fires . The grants will also be available to aboriginal communities and non-profits affected by fires and highway closures .
Businesses and organizations along Highway 20 , evacuation areas on Highway 97 south of Prince George , Highway 26 to Barkerville and the eastern Cariboo Regional District communities of Horsefly and Likely .
The eligibility will be reviewed and adjusted as conditions change , but the government wants to get the program going as soon as possible , Donaldson said .
Applications are open today and online application forms are available here . Information on the program and links are also available at www.redcross.ca and the Red Cross has a small business phone helpline at 1-855-999-3345 . Phone service is available Monday to Friday between 6 a.m. and 5 p.m .
Eligible organizations are those with 50 employers or fewer , have a income of $ 250,000 per year , have been in operation on or before July 7 , 2017 and have resumed operations or are intending to restart as soon as possible .
“ We know that hundreds of small businesses in rural B.C . have been adversely impacted by wildfire activity and this initial support is designed to give these businesses some assistance as they resume operations again , ” said Jobs Minister Bruce Ralston .
Rain across some of the fire-affected regions helped slow down fires , but B.C . Wildfire Service spokesman Kevin Skrepnek said they were showers and the effect is temporary .
“ We 're likely going to see conditions rebound pretty quickly here , ” Skrepnek said .
Dr. Bonnie Henry of the B.C . Centre for Disease Control said that the smoke that has hung over some communities for the past month has led to an increase in medical visits from people with chronic respiratory conditions , it is not expected to have long-term impacts .
“ We still consider even the month to be relatively short term exposure , ” Henry said . “ We do n't expect long-term health effects as you would see with long-term exposure to air pollution like you would see in a city like Beijing . ”
The latest estimate in area burned by the more than 1,000 wildfires reported since April 1 is 7,290 square kilometres , an area more than twice the size of Metro Vancouver . By that measure it is the second largest fire season on record for B.C. , with more than 8,500 square kilometres burned in 1958 .
Costs to date are $ 292 million , with 4,000 people working on the fire control effort .
Skrepnek said many seasonal firefighters and support workers are preparing to return to school or work after the Labour Day weekend , and plans are underway to replace them if necessary . Fire department dispatchers and military personnel are being recruited , he said .
The government of Saudi Arabia bought the Merrywood estate of AOL co-founder Steve Case for $ 43 million , reports said Wednesday .
The house was initially listed for $ 49.5 million , and was sold last week , the Wall Street Journal reported .
The CNBC reported that the house is expected to be used as an embassy by Saudi Arabia .
The 23,000 square-foot estate , located along the Potomac River , has nine bedrooms , gardens , an indoor lap pool , outdoor swimming pool , a wine cellar , a tennis court and a gym .
Case and his wife had reportedly bought the house for $ 24.5 million in 2005 .
Merrywood was also the childhood home of Jackie Kennedy .
Steve Case is a co-founder of AOL and CEO of venture-capital firm Revolution LLC .
The couple travel often and did not need the property anymore , Sotheby 's International Realty and JLL said in a statement .
TOKYO : Shares in Toshiba Corp tumbled on Wednesday after the conglomerate said it would book a US $ 6.3 billion hit to its U.S. nuclear unit and may sell more of its prized flash-memory chip business than planned to urgently raise funds .
Scrambling for capital , Toshiba said it would consider selling most , even all , of its stake in the chips business - a decision that has investors questioning whether the company has a long-term future without the unit .
`` Usually in a corporate turnaround plan , the company would keep its most competitive business after selling non-performing businesses , '' said Masayuki Kubota , chief strategist at Rakuten Securities .
`` This turnaround plan gives no hope for Toshiba 's future , '' he said .
Toshiba will be meeting creditor banks on Wednesday to seek their understanding and support .
As of end of September , Toshiba 's loans from banks and insurers stood at about 800 billion yen ( US $ 7 billion ) , a financial source has told Reuters . Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp and Mizuho Bank are its biggest creditors .
While the two lenders and state-backed Development Bank of Japan Inc have so far expressed support for Toshiba , other creditors will need more convincing before they back Toshiba further , sources familiar with the matter have said .
`` Toshiba needs to come up with a convincing turnaround plan but it 's not an easy task , '' said an executive at one of the creditor banks . `` And we need to make sure there are no more negative surprises , '' he said .
Toshiba shares slid 11.4 percent in morning trade , compared with a 1 percent gain for the broader market .

Even more than two decades later , Harry Reid is haunted by the video an activist told him to watch .
Men grabbed a little girl in a white dress at a celebration in Egypt , then spread her legs and pulled out a cutting instrument . Blood pooled beneath her .
A Nov. 16 , 2016 , photo of then-Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid . Alex Brandon / Associated Press A Nov. 16 , 2016 , photo of then-Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid . A Nov. 16 , 2016 , photo of then-Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid . ( Alex Brandon / Associated Press )
“ I can still see it in my mind 's eye , right now , ” said Reid , now 77 .
Back then , as a second-term U.S. senator , he was so horrified by the image that he took up the fight against female genital mutilation and authored a law criminalizing it .
While international health authorities say that the ritual has been performed on more than 200 million girls , primarily in Africa , the Middle East and Asia , the 1996 U.S. law remained largely symbolic — until now .
On Wednesday , federal authorities accused Dr. Jumana Nagarwala , an emergency room physician in Detroit , of performing genital mutilation on two 7-year-old girls at a medical clinic in Livonia , Mich .
Charged with female genital mutilation , transportation with intent to engage in criminal sexual activity and making a false statement to a federal officer , she faces a maximum sentence of life in prison if convicted on all counts .
The girls were told they were brought to Detroit from Minnesota for a “ special ” girls trip , according to a court filing . After arriving at a hotel , the girls were taken to the doctor “ to get the germs out ” because “ our tummies hurt . ”
Both girls told authorities that they were instructed not to talk about the procedure .
One said she was given a pad to wear in her underwear , while the other told authorities that after the procedure she could barely walk and felt pain down to her ankle . The second victim 's parents told investigators that they took their daughter to Nagarwala for a “ cleansing ” of extra skin .
Authorities say other girls may have been victimized by Nagarwala between 2005 and 2007 .
The doctor , a U.S. citizen born in Washington , denied that she had ever engaged in the practice , telling a federal officer during a voluntary interview that she knew it was illegal , according to a court document .
She pleaded not guilty . Her attorney did not return calls for comment .
According to her online bio at Henry Ford Hospital , where Nagarwala practices , she attended Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and speaks Gujarati , a language of western India .
Nagarwala has been placed on administrative leave and her clinical privileges have been suspended , according to Henry Ford spokeswoman Brenda Craig .
“ The alleged criminal activity did not occur at any Henry Ford facility , ” Craig said in a statement . “ We would never support or condone anything related to this practice . ”
The procedure may involve a partial or total removal of the clitoris , excision of the inner and outer folds of the vulva or the narrowing of the vaginal opening . Carried out mostly on girls between infancy and age 15 , the procedure can be intended to reduce sexual pleasure and promiscuity , and to prepare a girl for marriage .
The World Health Organization says genital cutting has no health benefits for girls or women . The procedure can cause severe bleeding , problems urinating and infections , while increasing the risk of complications in childbirth and newborn deaths .
It is unknown how many girls have undergone the procedure in the U.S. , but the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention believes the number at risk has risen as more people emigrate from countries where the practice is common , including Egypt , Ethiopia and Somalia .
Reid said he was never swayed by those who defended the practice as a cultural rite and said it 's not supported by religious texts .
“ You want a way to hold women back ? Just make it so to have sex is a painful thing , not any fun , ” he said . “ That 's what they 've done for generations . It 's a way that men suppress women . ”
Back in the 1990s , his staff had dissuaded him from getting involved in the issue , arguing that politically it made more sense for a woman to do it .
“ I accept that — except no one else would take the cudgel , ” he said . “ It was just me . I figured I 'm a lot better than nothing . ”
So he persisted . His bill slipped through , he said , without much fanfare .
The prosecution of Nagarwala 21 years later is “ clear evidence ” the practice is happening in the U.S. , according to activists .
“ There 's a myth that this is only happening to people in India or Africa , ” said Shelby Quast , director of the women 's rights organization Equality Now . “ It 's happening everywhere and we 're beginning to learn that . ”
She also said the arrest could lead to others : “ It was very quiet . People were not talking about this… . Where this practice is occurring , if there are other doctors that are performing this , I would expect people might start speaking up . ”
Though authorities say no one else has been charged under the 1996 law , at least two other criminal cases have been brought against people suspected of or who agreed to perform genital cutting in the U.S .
In 2002 , a Santa Clarita man was caught in an FBI sting when he agreed through an undercover agent to perform genital mutilation on children ages 8 and 12 .
The man told investigators he had performed more “ female circumcisions ” than anyone in the Western world , though authorities were unable to corroborate that . He and his girlfriend pleaded guilty to conspiracy and possessing child pornography .
In 2006 , an Ethiopian immigrant was convicted of aggravated battery and cruelty to children for removing his 2-year-old daughter 's clitoris with scissors at the family 's Atlanta-area apartment .
In 2013 , President Obama signed an amendment to Reid 's law that made it illegal to send a girl to another country to have the procedure done .
For Reid , that the alleged perpetrator in Detroit was a trained physician makes the case hard to comprehend , but he was happy to see his law being enforced .
“ I hope it focuses attention on a problem we have in America , ” he said .

Over the past month , nearly half a dozen calls Authority Bail Bonds has received have had nothing to do with bail bond . ( Source : WSFA 12 News )
A scam involving bail bonds is making the rounds . These people scare you into giving them money over the phone .
Normally when Mo Harper , owner of Authority Bail Bonds , answers the phone the person on the other line needs help bailing their loved one out of jail .
`` We basically have them come down and walk them through the process . They would pay us usually a 10 percent fee and we will go post their bond and all they do is promise they will show up for court , '' said Mo Harper , Owner of Authority Bail Bonds .
Over the past month , nearly half a dozen calls Harper has received have had nothing to do with bail bond .
`` I have gotten at least four calls from various people trying to verify agents they say work with me . All the ones they name I have no knowledge of , '' said Harper .
Last week his suspicions a scam was circulating were verified when one of his agents made contact with a caller who claimed his son was in jail .
`` He was told he needed to send some money asap through a green dot card . What really was the red flag is he had an email similar to our email . The agent basically held him on the phone a little longer to get more information as he could , before he busted him and told him his son was n't in jail and he knew he was a scam artist and the individual hung up , '' said Harper .
Tony Garrett with Central Alabama CrimeStoppers has been contacted by other bail bond companies experiencing the same thing .
`` These scams are quite common , '' said Garrett .
Garrett says the scammers are strategic .
`` That is what they want you to do . They want you to be panicked , upset , and out of your element , '' said Garrett .
In an effort to make sure you do n't fall victim to these scammers claims , Harper has a very specific reminder to the public .
`` If someone calls you and tells you someone in jail you need to verify it first of all . Before we put up any money we want someone to sign a contract saying they will be responsible for the bond amount in case he/she skips . If you do n't sign anything do n't send anything , ” said Harper .
CrimeStoppers says while it is hard to track down the scammers , if you do receive a call you can contact local law enforcement to alert them .

At least 11 soldiers were killed in a suicide attack near a military camp in Swat , a valley in north-western Pakistan and hometown of noble laureate Malala Yosuafzai .
Inter Service Public Relations ( ISPR ) , the Pakistani army 's media wing , said in a statement on Saturday that another 13 soldiers were wounded . The injured have been moved to a military hospital for treatment .
`` The suicide attacker blew himself up at a check post near an army unit headquarters in Kabal area of the valley , '' Karman Khan , a spokesperson for the police , told dpa .
Tehreek-e-Taliban ( TTP ) claimed responsibility for the attack on the army camp in an email sent to media .
Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi condemned the attack .
`` The coward terrorist enemy is no match for our valiant sons of the soil , '' Abbasi said . `` No cowardly attack and deter us in pursuing our struggle against the menace of terrorism to its logical conclusion . ''
The valley had fallen to Taliban before the military launched a series of military operations in 2007 and helped peace return to the area . In 2009 , Taliban were pushed across the border into Afghanistan , where Pakistan alleges they are sheltered .
In 2012 , Taliban gunmen shot and severely injured Malala Yousafzai , who later become the youngest laureate of the Nobel Peace Prize for campaigning for girls ' education in the Swat valley .
Violence in Pakistan has declined in recent years following a series of military offensives along the northwestern border with Afghanistan , but militant groups are still able to carry out bloody attacks .
There have been a number of deadly assaults in recent months in the northwest as well as in the southwestern Balochistan province .
The Swat Valley was under the de facto control of the Pakistani Taliban in 2007-2009 .
The area has seen sporadic militant attacks since , including assassinations of local leaders who cooperate with the government .

A24 has released the Woman Walks Ahead trailer . Based on true events , the story follows widowed artist Catherine Weldon ( Jessica Chastain ) who travels alone to North Dakota to paint a portrait of Chief Sitting Bull ( Michael Greyeyes ) , but finds herself in the middle of a conflict between the Lakota tribe and the US Army .
Judging by the trailer , the film does n't look bad as much as it looks kind of tired and done . It has talented actors , but I 'm left wondering why we do n't just get a Sitting Bull movie and why this story has to be told from the perspective of a white character . Yes , audience surrogates are important , but they can also be supporting characters . That 's not to say Woman Walks Ahead will be a bad movie ( although it did n't really make waves when it played at TIFF last year ) as much as it could easily be a forgettable one .
Check out the Woman Walks Ahead trailer below . The film hits DirecTV on May 31st and opens in theaters on June 29th . Woman Walks Ahead also stars Sam Rockwell .
Here 's the official synopsis for Woman Walks Ahead :
# 1 The emergence of Hardik Pandya
India won the Test series against Sri Lanka in Sri Lanka comprehensively . ​Virat Kohli 's success story as India 's Test captain has extended itself yet again . The newest chapter of this saga describes the team 's ruthless performance in the recently concluded series against Sri Lanka , where they whitewashed the hosts in a thumping 3-0 victory.The best thing about this victory was that each win was greater in margin than the one preceding it.Here 's a look at the dominant results that India managed to pull off over the course of the 3-match series:1st Test : July 26 to 30 , Galle : India won by 304 runs2nd Test : Aug 3 to 7 , Colombo : India won by an innings and 53 runs3rd Test : Aug 12 to 16 , Pallekele : India won by an innings and 171 runsAn array of positives will emerge for India after this series , just as a bunch of problems will latch itself onto anyone who is involved with Sri Lankan cricket . Here is a list of the top five talking points of the series , with respect to both the participating teams : Hardik Pandya has been the biggest positive from this seriesIt is always better to shock people and change their expectations than to give them exactly what they think you can do : Jonah HillWhen Hardik Pandya made his international debut in January last year , no one gave him a second glance . He seemed to be a run-of-the-mill all-rounder of the new era who bowled with an average of 30 and batted lower down the order just to belt a few into the crowd in the death overs.He did just that for a year . He was a lightning-quick fielder , a useful fourth/fifth bowler and he knew how to swing the willow : the salient features of a modern day limited overs batsman . He performed brilliantly in the ICC Champions Trophy that was hosted in England this June , and won plaudits from cricket experts all over the world.In spite of his heroics in one-day cricket , he was n't considered for Test matches . No one even thought of trying him out in the longest format of the game , and rightly so : he had no first-class centuries and had not shown a smidgen of the temperament that is such a pre-requisite to playing Test cricket.The selectors decided to try him out for the Sri Lanka series though , and the youngster grabbed the ( unexpected ) opportunity with both hands . He performed well throughout the series , and silenced naysayers every time he set foot on the field.He played three matches , bowled 32 overs and picked up four wickets with a bowling average of 23.75 to go with an economy of 2.96 : his numbers with the ball are impressive , but they do n't even come close to his exploits with the bat . He walked out to the middle just three times in the entire series and ended up scoring 178 runs at an average of 59.33 with a fifty and a perfectly-paced hundred.The biggest positive from Pandya 's successful introduction to Test cricket was how he seemed to be more at home with every passing game . There was steady improvement and an increasing sense of belief that he belonged at this level.When he came out to bat in the first two Tests , the situation was tailor-made for him . The 23-year-old just had to come in and ameliorate on a good foundation , like he always does . The third Test , though , was a challenge for the man from Gujarat . He walked into a tricky phase of the game , when the Indian score read 322/6 and it looked like the hosts had a real chance of matching up to Kohli 's men for the first time in the series.Pandya , however , had other plans . He dug in , let the storm pass , and scored his first fifty runs in a slow , steady and seamless manner . The Sri Lankans were already deflated by then . What followed was a sheer decimation of the bowling attack , as Pandya shed his defensive skin and unleashed his natural game on the proceedings . He smashed 26 runs in an over and scored his next fifty runs at rapid pace.The right-hander was declared the Man of the Match for the innings , and in the post-match presentation , Kohli declared that Pandya was the biggest positive for India from the series.It ca n't get any better for the youngster in his maiden series , can it ? ​
LANSING , Mich. ( WOOD ) – The Michigan Education Trust ( MET ) announced today that it will reopen enrollment on Friday , Dec. 1 , just in time for holiday gift buyers to buy or contribute toward a child 's 529 prepaid tuition contract .
“ We like to say that , unlike the latest toy or gadget that children will quickly outgrow or lose interest in , the gift of a college education lasts a lifetime , ” said Robin Lott , executive director of the 529 prepaid tuition program administered by the Michigan Department of Treasury .
Lott said that grandparents , other family members or friends can purchase a new MET prepaid tuition contract in a child 's name , or contribute money toward an existing contract .
She also noted that contract holders qualify for a tax deduction on their Michigan tax returns for purchases or contributions made by Dec. 31 .
MET closes enrollment for a period each year in order to review pricing . During that time , it does not sell new contracts .
Also today , the 529 prepaid tuition program announced that its contract purchase prices will remain unchanged until April 30 , 2018 . Prices will increase 1 percent on May 1 and remain in effect through Sept. 30 , 2018 .
That means until April 30 , for example , that purchasers of Pay-As-You-Go contracts will continue to pay $ 589 for a credit hour of tuition under a full-benefits contract , which guarantees full payment of tuition and mandatory fees at any Michigan public university ; $ 474 per credit hour under a limited-benefits contract , which covers up to 105 percent of the weighted average tuition of Michigan 's public four-year universities ; and $ 110 per credit hour for a community college contract .
MET also sells contracts through lump-sum and monthly purchase plans .
More information about MET is available at SETwithMET.com or 800-MET-4-KID .

Srinagar
In occupied Kashmir , the Jamaat-e-Islami ( JI ) has expressed solidarity with all illegally detained Kashmiris lodged in local and far-off jails only because of their commitment to the cause of right to self-determination for the people of Jammu and Kashmir .
A JI spokesman in a statement issued in Srinagar said that the Indian government had utterly failed to fulfill its promises made to the Kashmiri people through the resolutions of the UN Security Council and New Delhi was now denying to have made any such pledge with the people and was bent upon suppressing their genuine voice .
The statement said , whosoever raises this demand is declared anti-India and a threat to the security of occupied Kashmir and is implicated in various cases and detained and deprived of rights of liberty and freedom of speech and even convicted under false charges in the courts .
In addition , the Jamaat said , unjustified force is used to suppress this voice and civil administration , police and other forces have been given unbridled powers under black laws to force the helpless people to surrender their genuine cause .
The spokesman condemned the illegal detention of the party leader Bashir Ahmad Lone and the Hurriyat leaders lodged in Delhi 's Tihar jail including Shabbir Ahmed Shah . He demanded unconditional release of all Kashmiri political detainees.—KMS

WASHINGTON : Defence Secretary Jim Mattis vowed on Wednesday ( Jun 14 ) that the Trump administration would not repeat the `` mistakes of the past '' in dealing with Afghanistan , after the president gave him the power to set troop levels in the war-torn country .
Mattis said the `` delegation of authority '' letting the Pentagon set troop levels in Afghanistan would give the military greater agility in conducting operations .
Unlike his predecessor Barack Obama , who kept battlefield commanders on a tight leash and scrutinised each deployment down to the individual soldier , President Donald Trump has been happy to defer his warfighting policy to his top brass - the men he likes to call `` my generals . ''
Battlefield commanders under Obama often felt hampered by seemingly arbitrary troop caps .
Currently about 8,400 US troops are in Afghanistan along with another 5,000 or so NATO forces .

`` This administration will not repeat the mistakes of the past , '' Mattis said in a statement .
`` We can not allow Afghanistan to once again become a launching point for attacks on our homeland or on our allies , '' Mattis said . He was alluding to the former Taliban government 's granting haven to Al-Qaeda in the run-up to the September 11 , 2011 terror attacks in New York and Washington .
Earlier , Mattis told lawmakers that he would present Trump with a new US military strategy for Afghanistan by mid-July .
American military commanders in Afghanistan and the surrounding region have requested thousands of additional boots on the ground for months to boost the NATO troop presence there .
`` Together in the inter-agency , we will define the way ahead and I will set a US military commitment consistent with the commander in chief 's strategic directions and his foreign policy , as dictated by Secretary of State Tillerson , '' Mattis told lawmakers during a hearing at the Senate Appropriations Committee .
Mattis said the decision would come in consultation with other US government agencies in a more comprehensive approach to the conflict .
Prior to the White House decision , Mattis had warned that the Taliban was surging - having claimed a series of deadly attacks , including against Afghan military bases and positions - and that America still was `` not winning '' in the country nearly 16 years after the US-led invasion there .
The latest report shows more than 24,000 Iowans registered to vote as Democrats last month .
The increase was likely fueled by the Iowa Democratic Party 's statewide primary for governor and Democratic primaries in three of the four Iowa congressional districts .
The last time Democrats saw a voter registration increase of this magnitude in the month of June was back in 2006 . Democrat Chet Culver won the party 's competitive gubernatorial primary that year , en route to winning the governorship that November .
Republicans had just one statewide primary in June . for secretary of agriculture . Republicans gained about registered voters last month .
By the end of June , nearly two million Iowans were registered voters according to a report form the Iowa . The majority of Iowa voters — nearly 695,000 of them — are independents and are registered as “ no party ” voters . Republicans have a roughly 24,000 registration edge over Democrats statewide .
The two Iowa congressional districts that basically cover the eastern half of the state have a voter registration edge for Democrats , while the fourth district that covers northwest and north central Iowa has a significant Republican voter registration edge . The third district that covers the southwest quadrant of the state is basically a draw , with nearly an equal number of Republicans and Democrats .
Republican Rod Blum of Dubuque is seeking reelection in the first congressional district . That 's where Democrats hold a roughly 23,000 voter registration edge over Republicans . Abby Finkenauer of Dubuque is Blum 's Democratic challenger . While incumbents are heavily favored to win congressional race , this contest is often listed as a toss-up by national rating agencies .
The Cook Political Report uses the phrase “ leaning Republican ” in its rating of the third district race between Republican Congressman David Young of Van Meter and Democrat Cindy Axne of West Des Moines .
Republican Congressman Steve King 's district has about 70,000 more Republicans than Democrats . J.D . Scholten of Sioux City is the Democrat who 's challenging King 's bid for a ninth term in the U.S. House . Democrat Dave Loebsack of Iowa City is seeking a seventh term in congress . He faces a rematch with Republican Christopher Peters of Coralville in the second congressional district . It leans Democratic , with about 23,000 more Democrats than Republicans .
Independent voters are the largest block of voters in Iowa 's first , second and third congressional districts . In the fourth district , Republicans even outnumber independents — by about 20,000 .
There were about 11,000 registered Libertarian voters in Iowa at the end of June .
John Goodman is n't paying attention to the Roseanne Barr controversy — and he could n't care less about ABC 's decision to pull the plug on “ Roseanne ” and its Emmy campaign .
“ I was n't gon na get an Emmy anyway , ” Goodman said in a video Wednesday , which was obtained by ET .
“ I 've been up there [ 11 ] times already , and if I did n't get one I 'm not gon na get one , ” the actor added .
Up until now , Goodman — who served as Barr 's on-screen husband for more than a decade on “ Rosanne ” — has remained silent on her controversial tweet about former Obama aide Valerie Jarrett .
“ I would rather say nothing than to cause more trouble , ” the 65-year-old explained .
Asked about the tweet that his longtime co-star sent out Tuesday , comparing Jarrett to an ape , Goodman claimed that he did n't pay it — nor the backlash — any mind .
“ I do n't know anything about it , ” he said . “ I do n't read it . ”
Describing how he 's been doing now that “ Rosanne ” has been cancelled , Goodman said : “ Everything 's fine . ”
While Barr has apologized for her tweet about Jarrett , she has also repeatedly defended it — calling her words “ insensitive , not racist . ”
ABC decided to cancel “ Rosanne ” on Tuesday and then suspended its “ For Your Consideration ” Emmy campaign the following day . Judging from the comments of voters , though , the show was n't likely to win anyway .
“ You ca n't put some alt-right scumball on your network and give her a platform , ” animation producer Deb Zak told Vanity Fair back in April . “ I do n't care if somebody has a conservative viewpoint , that 's fine . She has a hateful viewpoint. ” ​
Celebrity chef Mario Batali has taken leave from ABC 's The Chew and his B & B Hospitality Group , a global restaurant empire , amid sexual harassment allegations made by former employees .
WATCH BELOW : Half of working women have faced sexual harassment
Speaking exclusively to Eater New York , four women , all former employees , accuse Batali of “ inappropriate touching in a pattern of behaviour that spans at least two decades. ” They allege he inappropriately touched them , groped them and made lewd comments . The orange Crocs-wearing celeb chef was known for “ constantly making overtly sexual and inappropriate ” comments , according to a former staffer at one of his New York restaurants .
Fellow celebrity chef and television personality , Anthony Bourdain , alluded to the expose in two tweets yesterday , writing , “ No . Trust me . Monday is really going to suck , ” in one . And then followed up with another .
Story continues below It 's where you stand when the people you care about and admire do awful things that matter . Keeping head down and hoping it goes away ? No . — Anthony Bourdain ( @ Bourdain ) December 11 , 2017
Batali , who is also a minority stakeholder in the Eataly franchise , said to Eater that he would take leave from his restaurant operations and his co-hosting duties on The Chew for an unspecified time . He also admitted that the alleged incidents “ match up ” with his behaviour .
“ I have work to do to try to regain the trust of those I have hurt and disappointed . For this reason , I am going to step away from day-to-day operations of my businesses . We built these restaurants so that our guests could have fun and indulge , but I took that too far in my own behaviour . I wo n't make that mistake again . I want any place I am associated with to feel comfortable and safe for the people who work or dine there , ” he said .
The women have chosen to remain anonymous for fear of retribution — Batali is an exceptionally powerful player in the restaurant industry — and they have described him as vindictive when crossed .

“ He has clear intent on being threatening when he is wronged . And the level of vindictiveness is very chilling , ” one woman said .
As recently as this past October , Batali was reprimanded for inappropriate behaviour when a B & B restaurant employee filed a formal complaint . He was ordered to undergo training , according to the company .
The company says although it has had sexual harassment training in place for over 10 years , it will now enlist an independent corporate investigations firm for any employees who wish to make a claim against a restaurant owner .
“ We take these allegations very seriously . We pride ourselves on being a workplace for our employees where they can grow and deliver great service with equal opportunity and free from any discrimination . We have strong policies and practices in place that address sexual harassment . We train employees in these policies and we enforce them , up to and including termination , ” B & B said in a statement . “ Mr . Batali and we have agreed that he will step away from the company 's operations , including the restaurants , and has already done so . ”
While researching the recently published book Apartheid , Guns and Money : A Tale of Profit , Open Secrets collected approximately 40 000 archival documents from 25 archives in seven countries . This treasure trove contains damning details of individuals and corporations that propped up apartheid and profited in return .
Many of these documents were kept secret until now . Most remain hidden despite South Africa 's transition to democracy .
Open Secrets believes that it is vital to allow the public to scrutinise the primary evidence . Here we invite you behind the scenes to look at the documents that informed the book .
The Archive for Contemporary Affairs , a four story brown face-brick building at the University of the Free State in Bloemfontein is an unassuming place .
Yet , its 3.5km long shelves of files contain some of the shadiest secrets from South Africa 's past . Many of the National Party 's ( NP ) most prominent politicians sent their collections , including official NP documents , to this archive . There is no longer a National Party , and it is unclear whether anyone really wants to ‘ own ' this memory of oppression that delivered so much paperwork .
It is nonetheless a national treasure worthy of far more attention by researchers from across the country . Despite reading through hundreds of folders from PW Botha 's and FW de Klerk 's archives , the Open Secrets team never expected to be delivered a series of folders marked ‘ National Party donations ' .
Out of the folders came the signed cheques , fawning letters of thanks and promises of anonymity that secretive party funding demands .
Around 70 individual donors were identified in these pages . The names in the folders ? Some of South Africa 's most prominent businessmen , past and present , are a few of whom we highlight .
While the story of party finance is often revealed only through whispers , in this unassuming archive we had found indisputable documentary evidence .
The letters featured here provide a glimpse into the complicity between big business and the oppressive apartheid regime that was until now kept secret .
Some donors were unsurprising , given their long term complicity with the regime . In a letter written in 1988 , FW de Klerk informed PW Botha of a R50 000 donation from Barlow Rand – now trading as the large conglomerate , Barloworld .
De Klerk notes that , “ they prefer to keep their contribution confidential… ” before stating that one of the companies directors D.E . Cooper would handle the donations .
Barlow Rand was one of the chief suppliers of technology to the government .
Between the 1960s and 1980s , the corporation 's leadership sat on PW Botha 's Defence Advisory Board all the while presenting itself as an enlightened opponent of apartheid .
The two-faced nature of many of these corporations and their executives is a theme that runs throughout this collection .
Another person in these documents , who has continued making super profits in a democratic South Africa , is Shoprite businessman Christo Wiese .
Currently tied in fourth place with Johann Rupert on the Forbes list of the richest Africans and living in a mansion in Clifton , Wiese was also eager to support the NP and “ anxious ” to have this support made known to the Prime Minister .
In 1989 , Minister Kent Durr sent a letter to the newly appointed President FW de Klerk , informing him of Wiese 's financial support .
Durr fondly describes Wiese , then the director of the clothing retail giant Pepkor , as “ an old friend and supporter of the National Party ” .
Of course , as the Gupta 's Saxonwold Shebeen has shown us , these relationships also require a more personal touch . This is captured perfectly in a letter sent by prominent PG Glass executive chairman , Bertie Lubner .
In the letter written to PW Botha , dated 23 June 1982 , Lubner writes to thank the Prime Minister for “ a very wonderful evening which we spent with you , charming members of your family and other guests ” .
He proceeds to write of how much he admires Botha 's leadership of the country : “ It is men with such high ideals and determination like yourself that create history . ”
Post-apartheid amnesia ensured that at the time of his death in 2016 , Lubner was praised as a beloved philanthropist and iconic business leader with far too little said about his support for the establishment during apartheid .
This letter and others of a similar nature , from Bennie Slome of Tedelex and Macsteel 's Eric Samson , were some of the more surprising finds in the archive .
This is because these men were widely known as part of the self-proclaimed liberal English-speaking business elite of the time . Though perhaps , this surprise is misplaced – big business motivated by profit , notoriously funds whoever is in power . We also found letters of support from Altech ( now electronics giant Altron ) head , WP ( Bill ) Venter .
A long-time ally of the apartheid military , Venter made profits supplying the military with missile systems and other key technology at the height of apartheid 's war in Angola and cross-border raids . To return the favour , Venter made hefty donations to the NP .
In 1982 , he pledged R150 000 ( R2.4m in todays terms ) – with promises of more to come which he honoured in 1985 and 1989 with generous donations of R200 000 ( R2.2m in today 's terms ) .
In the letter , Venter points out the success that his company has achieved , adding that , “ …we believe that we would be able to achieve very little without the firm support of the current [ NP ] government… ”
In February 2017 , Venter finally stepped down as Altron chair and was praised for his contribution to the South African economy . His collaboration with the apartheid state was conveniently ignored .
The Truth and Reconciliation Commission ( TRC ) concluded that many businesses “ benefited financially and materially from apartheid ” .
While many businesses presented themselves as victims of apartheid and part of an enlightened opposition to apartheid – these letters tell a different story .
They reveal a complicity with the NP government , and show that a significant portion of the business elite kept the taps open to the party at the height of domestic repression and foreign wars .
It also allows us to go beyond the broad brushstrokes of the TRC and have a more nuanced conversation about the degrees of complicity within the private sector .
As the Gupta leaks have shown , South Africa is still struggling with the undue influence of the private sector in politics , it is vital to understand the nature of these networks .

South Africa desperately needs a private sector that can create jobs – but it also requires far more effective enforcement of the laws governing private sector misconduct .
This is an important message as Parliament has now finally begun the process of drafting a law that could for the first time regulate the private funding of political parties .
The success of this process and the enforcement of these rules is vital to ensure that the powerful and corrupt are limited in their use of secret funding to undermine democratic politics and buy political favours .
Secret funds fuelled the National Party 's machinery – we can not allow it to continue to be a conduit for entrenching political and economic inequality in South Africa .
* To gain access to apartheid 's secret records our partners at the South African History Archive ( SAHA ) relied on requests made under the Promotion of Access to Information Act ( PAIA ) . Many of our requests remain outstanding forcing us to turn to the courts . We continue to demand the release of the apartheid archive . For this purpose , SAHA met the South African Reserve Bank on the 4th of August at the South African High Court , Johannesburg Division .
* The Archive for Contemporary Affairs at the University of the Free State does not require any PAIA requests to access documents .
* Open Secrets is an independent non-profit with a mission to promote private sector accountability for economic crime and related human rights violations in Southern Africa .

2017 Predictions on Trump , Gold , Silver , Housing , Stocks , Bonds & Antarctica-Clif High
January 1 , 2017
By Greg Hunter 's USAWatchdog.com ( Early Sunday Release )
Internet data mining expert Clif High says forget about the rumors and predictions of Donald Trump being blocked from taking office . High says Trump will be sworn in as the 45th President and explains , “ I do n't have any data that says , hard stop , Trump is assassinated . I do n't have that . . . . I am willing to back my data with real money , an ounce of silver , and I have an ounce of silver , and I would be willing to bet the inauguration part goes through smoothly given the emotional data sets we have now . ”
High , who calls what he does “ Predictive Linguistics , ” mines the internet and collects billions of data points to produce forecasts of the future . On the financial markets , High simply says , “ We 're screwed . . . . The equity markets in our data sets are highly manipulated . So , if you ask will there be a crash ? I say there already is a crash . Everybody that is not part of the financial system at the top end is currently living in a depression , and the media does not acknowledge this . ”
On the U.S. dollar and its purchasing power , High predicts , “ The purchasing power is going to be eroded away fairly quickly . I suspect the erosion ( of the U.S. dollar ) is going to start in March or so . . . . The turning point for the Trump euphoria will hit at the end of February and carry on through March and April . There will probably be people that will define this as a crash . . . . In our data sets , around March and April , the erosion of the dollar continues . . . The Fed , in a laggardly way , starts to chase interest rates . . . . We may jump to 9 % or 10 % interest rates as quickly as March or April . ”

Dear Amy : My boyfriend and I have been on/off for the last five years .
During the time we were apart , he had another girlfriend . I did n't know about her . He and I maintained a “ friends with benefits ” relationship during our breaks .
After I became pregnant with his child , I found out that they were very serious . I learned that she was pregnant , too . Our sons were born nine days apart .
They are no longer together , and he and I are trying to work things out , but I ca n't seem to let their relationship go .
I know that Facebook is n't “ life , ” but it bothers me that their entire relationship was broadcast on FB , but he wo n't even acknowledge us as being in a relationship .
He has never posted a picture of us or of our son .
He says he 's ashamed of himself ( not of me ) , but I ca n't help but feel like he 's not being truthful . I think he 's ashamed of me .
He tells me all the time : “ You 're not her , ” which makes me feel like he wishes he was n't with me . He says I 'm being insecure , and that he 's never going to care about Facebook .
I just do n't get why he could care about his Facebook status when he was with her , but not with me ?
Am I being stupid ?
— Worried
Dear Worried : When you ask me if you 're being “ stupid , ” you run the risk of supplying me with a descriptor I 'd rather not apply to a woman with a young child . However , this whole situation is unfortunate — because Rome is burning and you 're worried about your Facebook status .
I do agree that this status is a sign of where your guy 's priorities are , and while I 'm not inclined to side with him , I do appreciate his embarrassment over fathering two babies ( days apart ) with two different women . Yes , he should feel embarrassed . He deceived both women ( I imagine ) , and now his ability to be a good parent to both of his sons is compromised because one baby 's mother is insecure and threatened by the other . This impedes his ability to be present in his sons ' lives .
Your guy is not in charge of Facebook . You should post whatever photos you want the world to see . When people start to realize that your partner has two sons the same age with different women , he ( and you ) will face some questions .
Please understand that parenthood will not magically change your guy 's character . You should get all of your legal , custodial and financial ducks in a row regarding the child , encourage this man to be a good father to both of his children , but understand that he may not intend to lead a monogamous life .
Dear Amy : My “ adult ” 23-year-old son is home for the holidays .
He leads a more liberal lifestyle than my husband and me , and suffice it to say not only do our politics not match up , but neither do our hygiene practices .
To be blunt , his BO is killing us ! I did n't raise him this way and I absolutely ca n't stand it .
I just ca n't embrace not showering daily and not using a daily dose of antiperspirant .
How do you address an awkward and difficult topic with a person who is also awkward and difficult ?
— Mother of the Smelly Kid
Dear Mother : I assume you have heard the term “ adulting. ” This is a recently minted verb to describe the process that people in their 20s are now undertaking to finally exit their lengthy childhoods . Adulting refers to assuming some life skills , such as doing dishes , paying bills , and — yes , cleaning oneself .
I 'm assuming that you did teach your son these skills , but your fear of mentioning this now indicates that you are actually afraid to relate to him both as a parent and as a fellow adult .
( This does n't have anything to do with your politics — or his — by the way . )
Tell your son , “ We love having you home . But you 've got to wash yourself — and your clothes — while you 're here . Let me show you how to use the washer , and let 's put in a load . ”
Dear Readers : My own life is probably a lot like yours . I 've experienced poverty , prosperity , marriage , divorce , remarriage , step-parenting , caretaking , loss and grief . If you 've ever been curious about the life behind the advice column , I hope you 'll consider picking up my memoir , “ Strangers Tend to Tell Me Things : A Memoir of Love , Loss , and Coming Home. ” ( 2017 , Hachette ) .
SHICKSHINNY — Lena Zimmerman does not know how to swim , so she always brings her pink inner tube to the annual Polar Bear Plunge on Shickshinny Lake .
This year , the Harveyville resident took the plunge first with the words “ Last Time ” written in black marker on her trusted tube .
“ So nobody can talk me into doing it again next year , ” Zimmerman said . She 's taken the plunge for the past three years at the annual Freezin ' for a Reason event held by Glenn Schaffer on his lakeside property .
Schaffer said divers give donations before leaping off his dock to support Give Kids the World Village , a resort that caters to children with life-threatening diseases .
“ It 's give as you feel , give from the heart , ” Schaffer said . “ It 's a fun thing to do and it supports a great cause . ”
Schaffer took the first jump with Zimmerman and emerged from the brisk lake smiling to encourage the rest of the participants .
“ It 's ... cold , ” he said . “ It 's probably about 33 degrees . This is brutal on the body but it 's fun . ”
Jumpers Sara Grier of Shickshinny and Paul Binskofski of Dunmore warmed themselves up after the plunge by a large , roaring bonfire near the edge of the lake . Grier and her husband live on the lake and have participated in the plunge for the past four years .
“ It 's a great community event , ” she said .
Binskofski came to cross something off his bucket list . He said he 'd probably do a polar bear plunge again .
Participants warmed up by the fire , grabbed hotdogs from the grill and talked with neighbors after the initial plunge . Schaffer said the event has grown far beyond how it started as something for his family to do on New Year 's Day .
“ It 's exciting ... here we are doing something way different , ” he said . “ Every year it gets bigger and bigger . ”

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Monday proposed creating a new fast track to market for certain medical devices and a potential reduction in the amount of safety data required for approval .
REUTERS : The U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Monday proposed creating a new fast track to market for certain medical devices and a potential reduction in the amount of safety data required for approval .
Commissioner Scott Gottlieb announced the proposal in a blog posted on the FDA 's website . If implemented , it could save device companies millions of dollars in product testing and shave years off development times .
The proposals make good on President Donald Trump 's promise to cut regulations and sparked concern from public health advocates who fear the moves will harm patients . Already dozens of devices are recalled each year .
Gottlieb 's proposal would offer an alternative route to market for certain companies who do not meet the criteria for clearance under the agency 's existing fast track route , known as the 510 ( k ) pathway .
To win 510 ( k ) clearance a product must be moderate risk and substantially equivalent to an existing device , called a predicate . High-risk products such as implantable heart devices must go through a more rigorous process .
Gottlieb said that advancing technology means it can be hard for companies to identify a suitable predicate , `` which can create an obstacle to certain kinds of innovation and lead to inefficiency in the review process . ''

His new proposal would dispense with the need for a predicate and offer the option of using a benchmark consisting of a set of performance standards or guidance documents . The plan would be voluntary .
Janet Trunzo , a spokeswoman for the industry organization AdvaMed , said the organization `` commends FDA 's commitment to promoting patient access to medical technologies through innovative regulatory pathways . ''
Gottlieb said the FDA will also examine ways to speed the path to market for high risk products by re-evaluating the amount of safety data needed prior to approval . The agency will issue guidance shortly outlining `` how certain issues could be ultimately resolved in the post-market setting , rather than the pre-market setting , to allow patients to gain faster access to potentially life-saving devices . ''
Dr. Rita Redberg , a cardiologist at the University of California San Francisco and editor of JAMA Internal Medicine , said shifting safety monitoring from the pre-approval to the post-market setting would turn patients into guinea pigs .
`` When we use devices on patients without clinical studies first , the patients effectively become the trial and the insurers become the funder of the device trial , '' she said .
Others echoed Redberg 's concern .
`` I see a potentially huge problem in moving more risk to the post-approval setting , '' said Areta Kupchyk , a partner at Foley Hoag and former associate chief counsel at the FDA . `` It 's very difficult once a product has been approved to pull it back . ''

A.R . Gurney , the playwright who chronicled the foibles and mores of wealthy , white Anglo-Saxon protestants in plays such as “ The Dining Room , ” “ The Cocktail Hour , ” and “ Love Letters , ” died Tuesday at his Manhattan home . He was 86 .
Gurney was a member of the upper class society he anatomized onstage in shows like his 1981 breakout “ The Dining Room , ” which tells the overlapping tales of the WASP families who inhabit the same dining room over the course of many years . His well-known 1988 play , “ The Cocktail Hours , ” is a highly autobiographical tale that centers on a playwright who returns to his family home to ask his family for approval of the production of a play he wrote about them .
His 1988 play “ Love Letters ” became a regional-theater staple . The epistolary tale , presented as a staged reading that requires little prep for the often well-known older actors to step into the show , follows a not-quite romance between two wealthy childhood friends . The last Broadway production of “ Love Letters ” initially starred Mia Farrow and Brian Dennehy .
His 1995 play “ Sylvia ” was another success , in which a human actor plays a dog who is adopted by a middle-aged , upper-middle-class couple . Sarah Jessica Parker played Sylvia in the original Off Broadway production .
In later years , Gurney 's work sometimes took a more plainly political turn , with shows including “ O Jerusalem ” ( a 2003 play about the Middle East ) and “ Mrs . Farnsworth ” ( 2004 ) . More recent works included “ Love & Money , ” which played Off Broadway in 2015 .
One of three children , Gurney — often called Pete — was born in Buffalo , N.Y. , in 1930 , to a family whose patriarch was president of an insurance and real estate company . He attended Williams College and then the Yale School of Drama , from which he graduated in 1958 , and he wrote early plays including “ Children ” and “ The Middle Ages ” while teaching humanities at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology .
He is survived by his wife and their four children .
A students group has made another pitch to a Newfoundland town council to allow a rainbow crosswalk to be painted in their small community after councillors initially rejected the idea , sparking a province-wide debate over the issue .
Three teenagers from Indian River High School 's Gender-Sexuality Alliance made presentations to Springdale town council on Monday evening , hoping to convince councillors to reverse an earlier decision against the proposal .

Christina Pelley , one of the group 's teacher sponsors , said council made no decision after the three girls talked about everything from what their group is and statistics on mental health and LGBTQ youth , to what a rainbow crosswalk represents .
“ They did a fantastic job and whatever happens , it 's a positive for those girls and for the entire group , ” she said Tuesday .
“ There are a lot of conversations that have been started – important conversations that will keep going no matter what the result is , whether we get our rainbow crosswalk or not . ”
Councillors did n't vote on the material that was presented .
Lorinda Goudie , administrative assistant for the Springdale town council , said Tuesday there is no follow-up council meeting planned at this time .
She said it 's not known if or when the council may vote again on the crosswalk .

The mayor and other councillors were not immediately available Tuesday for comment .
Earlier this month , the council voted four to three against painting the crosswalk – something that 's been done across the country as a symbol of inclusion and support for the LGBTQ community .
The result prompted prominent Newfoundlanders to criticize the council for rejecting the rainbow , and offer their support to people in the LGBTQ community .
If you 're a LBGTQ kid in Springdale , please know that there are a whole lot of people in Newfoundland & Labrador that support you . Inclusion never divides . Your mayor is being a tool . You 're awesome . https : //t.co/vAdcskj6or — Mark Critch ( @ markcritch ) April 19 , 2018
“ If you 're a LGBTQ kid in Springdale , please know that there are a whole lot of people in Newfoundland and Labrador that support you , ” tweeted comedian Mark Critch , anchor of CBC 's “ This Hour Has 22 Minutes . ”
“ Inclusion never divides . Your mayor is being a tool . You 're awesome . ”
Ruth Cameron , another teacher sponsor and vice-principal of the school , said they are getting a lot of support in Springdale for the crosswalk , which they hoped would run between the school and the local stadium .
She said the group has also offered to raise funds to create the colourful crosswalk , but that they would n't want to infringe on union jobs to do it .

“ One of our mandates as a group is to try to educate more people about some of the issues around this and that people feel safe and do n't feel alone , and that 's something that 's coming out of this , ” she said of the alliance , which has about 25 core members and was started in 2014 .
Ryan Reid , who has been an advocate in Springdale for the crosswalk , said it demonstrates the importance of inclusiveness and acceptance in the community and within the school .
New Delhi : Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has denied before the Delhi High Court that he filed a false affidavit claiming he had not instructed his counsel to use derogatory words against Union minister Arun Jaitley .
Kejriwal 's response came in pursuance to the 23 August notice issued to him by Justice Manmohan on Jaitley 's plea seeking action against the chief minister for making a false statement during his cross-examination in a defamation suit against him and five other AAP leaders .
Jaitley , who has filed a Rs 10 crore defamation suit against Kejriwal and five other AAP leaders , had moved a fresh application alleging that the chief minister had falsely denied that he had instructed his then senior lawyer to make derogatory comments . This was opposed by his former counsel Ram Jethmalani two days later .
The high court listed the matter for hearing on 26 April .
In his response filed through advocate Anupam Shrivastav , Kejriwal has denied that he has committed any perjury or made any false statement supported by an affidavit under oath .
`` It is denied that the Senior Advocate representing the Defendant 1 ( Kejriwal ) on instructions had used abusive , offensive and per se defamatory words against the applicant/plaintiff ( Jaitley ) .
`` On the contrary , the Defendant Number 1 had at no time instructed his counsels to use abusive , offensive or defamatory language against the applicant , '' he said .
The chief minister also submitted that the Bar Council Rules and the Advocates Act 1961 prohibits a senior advocate from taking instructions in any case directly from a client .
`` Therefore no utterances of a senior advocate can be attributed to the instructions of the client unless they are received through the Advocate on Record ( Instructing Counsel ) , '' he said .
Kejriwal said the union minister 's application was `` completely baseless '' and was filed with the sole motive of `` attempting to overawe the judicial process '' sought its dismissal with costs .
`` It is denied that untrue averments have been made in the pleadings which would amount to committing perjury , '' he said .
The high court had on 23 August sought Kejriwal 's response on the plea seeking that a criminal complaint be lodged against him for allegedly filing a false affidavit that he did not instruct his counsel to use derogatory words against Jaitley .
During the cross-examination on 17 May , Kejriwal 's then counsel Jethmalani had used offensive words against Jaitley .
Jethmalani had categorically stated in court that he had received specific instruction from Kejriwal to use derogatory words against Jaitley .
The application had stated that in an interview to the media on 26 July , Jethmalani reiterated his earlier statement that he had instructions from Kejriwal to use the words .
In his application , Jaitley had said that on 28 July , Jethmalani had written a letter to Kejriwal . He copied it to the union minister stating he had not received a reply from the chief minister on his 20 July letter .
According to the application , in the 20 July letter to Kejriwal , Jethmalani had said : `` ask your ( Kejriwal ) conscience how many times you used the word ... ''
Seeking strict action against Kejriwal for allegedly stating false facts , Jaitley 's counsel had said , `` a blatant , false and dishonest statement under oath by such a high functionary must attract severe and stringent punishment . ''
`` Committing perjury before this court by making false averments in pleadings is squarely covered under provisions of section 340 of CrPC and the defendant ( Kejriwal ) deserves to be punished in accordance with law , '' it had said .
The high court had on 26 July asked Kejriwal not to put `` scandalous '' questions to Jaitley during the cross-examination in the defamation suit filed by the Union minister against the chief minister and five others , Raghav Chadha , Kumar Vishwas , Ashutosh , Sanjay Singh and Deepak Bajpai .
The first Rs 10 crore defamation suit was filed by Jaitley against Kejriwal and five other AAP leaders in 2015 . The second Rs 10 crore defamation suit was filed on 22 May this year only against the chief minister .
Jaitley , who denied all the allegations of corruption levelled by the AAP leaders in December 2015 , had claimed that they had made `` false and defamatory '' statements in the case involving the DDCA , thereby harming his reputation .
The cross-examination of Jaitley by Jethmalani on 17 May led to heated exchanges between them .
Kejriwal had on 24 July told the high court that there was no instruction from him to Jethmalani to use objectionable remarks against Jaitley .

While Bollywood celebrities spend most of their time in the public eye , more often than not , their children are also privy to the flashes of the paparazzi cameras . Case in point : every single picture of Taimur Ali Khan Pataudi attracts even more attention than the previous one . This weekend , he was spotted at Rani Mukerji 's daughter Adira 's birthday party with other Bollywood children ( accompanied by their parents , of course ) . While Kareena Kapoor Khan was in attendance with Taimur , Karan Johar attended with his twins Roohi and Yash , Sridevi arrived with younger daughter Khushi , Shilpa Shetty Kundra with Viaan , Shah Rukh Khan with AbRam , Arpita Khan Sharma with Ahil ( who had Katrina Kaif as his date for the event ) and Tusshar Kapoor with Laksshya .
What looked like a fun fair-themed event had the parents and the children enjoying in equal measure . Karisma Kapoor took to some old school headgear with a headband made from a balloon and Shilpa Shetty Kundra 's Sunday binge came early as she gorged on ice cream ( she was joined by Arpita Khan Sharma and the hostess Rani Mukerji ) . In what could be the most adorable moment of the event , Karan Johar captured Taimur Ali Khan Pataudi with Roohi and Yash Johar , a picture he posted on his Instagram with the caption : “ And a new friendship begins…. ” . The parents also came together with some of the children for group photos , with Rekha fondly carrying Yash Johar in her arms .
Also in attendance at the birthday were Alia Bhatt , Karisma Kapoor , Rekha , Vaani Kapoor , Neil Nitin Mukesh , Shweta Bachchan Nanda and Raveena Tandon .

Another foreign fighter , British national Anna Campbell , was killed in the ranks of the PKK-affiliated groups in Syria on March 15 as result of a Turkish airstrike , her father confirmed yesterday .
Dirk Campbell , the father of the killed Briton , said to the BBC that his daughter was fighting against the Turkish Armed Forces ( TSK ) and the Free Syrian Army ( FSA ) in Afrin for the Women 's Protection Units ( YPJ ) , the women branch of the PKK 's Syrian-affiliated People 's Protection Units ( YPG ) , when killed by an airstrike . The PKK is recognized as a terrorist organization by the U.K. , along with Turkey , the U.S. and the EU . However , its affiliations are not thought as a terrorist group by those countries except Turkey , despite evidence that proves strong links between them .
It was reported that Campbell , 26 , was a plumber and lived in East Sussex , southwestern U.K. , before joining the terrorist group . Campbell 's father said he tried to make her return to the U.K. many times but failed to do so .
While the number of British nationals killed in the ranks of the YPG has increased to eight , Campbell became the first woman among them .
In January , Alistair Burt , the U.K. minister of state for the Middle East , acknowledged that Britain is aware of the possible links between the PKK terrorist organization and the YPG , saying at a session of the House of Commons ' Foreign Affairs Committee : `` We are very concerned over possible links . We do n't seek any link with the PKK and ourselves in any way . ''
The U.K. government previously called on its citizens to not travel to Syria , warning that they may face being arrested and face a trial when returning to the U.K .
BERLIN : The German Defence Ministry said on Monday that the European fighter jet was in poll position to replace its Tornado jets , which it wants to phase out starting in 2025 .
It added in a statement that Boeing 's F-15 and F-18 fighters , as well as Lockheed Martin 's F-35 aircraft , were secondary options . No final decision has been made .
The Eurofighter Typhoon is a joint project between British defence group BAE , France 's Airbus and Italy 's Finmeccanica .
France and Germany said earlier this year they plan to develop an European fighter jet as they seek to tighten defence and security cooperation .

Cape Peninsula University of Technology ( CPUT ) students protested against financial exclusions on Thursday . About 200 people participated in the protests at the Cape Town campus .
Some protesters tried to disrupt classes which prompted police to disperse them using rubber bullets .
This came a day after Vice Chancellor Prins Nevhutalu resigned , following a disciplinary hearing that found him guilty of “ gross misconduct ” .
Some of the protesting students told Ground Up that they received a notice ordering them to pay their debt , failing which they would not be able to register next year .
Following the protest , students returned to class . Security from the firm Vetus Schola watched and protected entrances to the campus buildings . The firm has been on campus for over two months .
“ They are provoking us everyday , ” said protester Wanana Siyanda . “ If one of us responds , it will prove the need for their presence , but we do n't want them any more here ! ”
Protests have been ongoing on CPUT for months over fees , accommodation , workers ' issues , and the suspension of four students .
Last week St Mark 's Anglican Church in District Six , renowned for its anti-apartheid activities , was petrol bombed , allegedly by a student protester .
Protests are expected to continue on Friday .
Some protesters told Groundup that they wo n't stop until CPUT management meets them and acknowledges their demands on financial exclusion .

GRAND RAPIDS , Mich. ( WOOD ) — Grand Rapids-based MC Sports is closing stores after filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy .
In the bankruptcy filing Tuesday , MC Sports said it has closed or will close seven stores , but none of them are located in Michigan . The company also plans to look at underperforming stores to determine which ones will be viable in the future .
The sporting goods company also plans to hold liquidation sales at all of its stores to address “ legacy costs , ” including long-term leases and trade debt .
MC Sports said it filed for bankruptcy after it could n't reach a “ viable ” restructuring agreement with vendors , landlords and associates outside of court .
The company blamed increased competition for its downfall , including an uptick in direct and online sales . The company specifically pointed to weak Black Friday sales in its filing .

New signing Michy Batshuayi enjoyed a dream debut at Borussia Dortmund , scoring twice on Friday as his club edged Cologne 3-2 to move into second place in the Bundesliga .
BERLIN : New signing Michy Batshuayi enjoyed a dream debut at Borussia Dortmund , scoring twice on Friday as his club edged Cologne 3-2 to move into second place in the Bundesliga .
Andre Schuerrle made sure of Dortmund 's first league win of the year with an 84th minute winner after Cologne twice had come back from a goal down . Dortmund are second on 34 points , ahead of Bayer Leverkusen and Schalke 04 on goal difference .
Batshuayi arrived on Wednesday on loan from Chelsea to plug the gap left by the departure of last season 's Bundesliga top scorer Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang to Arsenal in the Premier League .
Dortmund coach Peter Stoeger , returning to Cologne only 61 days after his sacking , gave the 20-year-old Belgium international his first start and the player paid him back when he scored in the 35th minute for the lead .
He thought he scored again on the stroke of halftime but his effort was ruled off side after the use of the video assistant referee .
Cologne levelled on the hour when Roman Buerki cleared a shot and Simon Zoller nodded in on the rebound but Batshuayi responded only two minute later , pouncing on a defensive error to slot in .

Bottom club Cologne refused to give up and thought they had done enough to earn a point with Jorge Mere 's 70th minute header before Schuerrle unleashed an unstoppable shot into the top corner six minutes from time to earn Dortmund their first three points of 2018 .
Leaders Bayern Munich , 16 points clear at the top , travel to Mainz 05 on Saturday . Leverkusen face Freiburg while Schalke host Werder Bremen .

The players from Port Macquarie and Sawtell/Toormina line up for an historic photo prior to the first AFL North Coast women 's match being played on Saturday .
The players from Port Macquarie and Sawtell/Toormina line up for an historic photo prior to the first AFL North Coast women 's match being played on Saturday .
AFL history was made at Richardson Park with the first competitive women 's fixture .
After a long build-up of development , recruitment and training , the Sawtell/Toormina and Port Macquarie teams and a healthy crowd were champing at the bit for the first bounce .
It was entirely appropriate that the first goal was kicked by Alana Hanson , the region 's key instigator of the women 's competition .
Hanson booted both of Sawtell 's opening term goals as the Saints headed to the break with a narrow seven point lead .
The Saints women blew the game apart in the second quarter when they kicked six goals while holding Port scoreless .
The Magpies fought back in the second half to limit the scoring damage but the Saints won 10.7 ( 67 ) to 1.3 ( 9 ) .
Hanson finished the match with four goals for the victors and had support in front of goal from Keira Basset who kicked three .
The market for SUVs and crossovers continues to expand and automakers from every corner of the industry are preparing to exploit the body style 's success . That includes Lamborghini and even—believe or not—Ferrari . Naturally , Aston Martin wants in on the SUV game as well .
The British luxury and sports car brand previewed an electric SUV concept , dubbed the DBX , at the 2015 Geneva motor show , but now production plans are moving forward , according to a report from German publication Auto Bild .
The DBX Concept showcased an all-electric powertrain , but the latest report states Aston Martin will first offer gasoline engines before diving into an electric powertrain for its SUV . The engines should be familiar to any Aston Martin follower : a 5.2-liter twin-turbo V-12 and a 4.0-liter twin-turbo V-8 will both be offered when the SUV launches . The engines make 503 and 600 horsepower , respectively , and the V-8 is sourced from Mercedes-AMG .
Following the production DBX 's launch , Aston Martin is then expected to offer either a plug-in hybrid or all-electric variant of the SUV .
However , even the first units will arrive with some non-traditional automotive technology . Aston Martin also plans to keep the DBX Concept 's cameras , per the report . The cameras are put in place of traditional side mirrors and relay their images to screens positioned inside the vehicle . It 's not too different from the setup we 've seen on the brand 's Valkyrie hypercar project .
The report pegs 2019 for the launch of the SUV with a price range of $ 195,000 to $ 260,000 . Meanwhile , Rolls-Royce will also challenge the ultra-luxury segment with its Cullinan SUV . We 'd expect Rolls-Royce to push its opulent high rider even more upmarket , while the Aston should be decidedly sportier .
Brantford will celebrate the opening of its first new hotel in nearly a decade when the Holiday Inn Express and Suites welcomes its first guests in the spring .
Finishing touches are being put on the hotel at 27 Sinclair Blvd. , just off the Garden Avenue-Highway 403 interchange . The hotel , which cost $ 15.1 million to build , plus $ 1.2 million for the land , offers 70 standard rooms and 40 suites .
Management is accepting reservations online for arrivals on or after May 30 , said Peter Tosh , regional director of hotel capital projects and new builds with Vrancor Hospitality Corp. of Hamilton .
`` The market mix of visitors we are aiming for is diversified with corporate travellers during the week and mainly sports , weddings , groups and leisure travellers on weekend , '' said Tosh .
`` We will offer a modern , new hotel experience in Brantford . ''
The last new hotel built in Brantford was the Hampton Inn and Suites , which broke ground on Fen Ridge Court in the spring of 2008 and opened in the summer of 2009 . Next door to the Hampton Inn , construction has started a new Staybridge Suites , which is expected to open in late fall .
In January 2008 , an agent submitted to the city on behalf of Vrancor , run by hotelier Darko Vranich , a rezoning application that would allow the construction of two hotels at that spot .
It took a decade to plan and build the Holiday Inn Express , with details of the second hotel , a Home2 Suites by Hilton , to be announced soon .
`` I want to build two types of hotels , each with a new format , in Brantford because I believe there is a market for both . Brantford is growing and it needs new hotels , '' Vranich told The Expositor at the time .
Fast forward 10 years to Tosh 's explanation of what it took for the company to accomplish its goal .
`` While we have experience of building 16 hotels in Ontario , we do take time carefully planning and co-ordinating details , '' he said .
`` We have several new-build and existing hotels ' capital improvement projects happening at the same time . ''
Tosh said the City of Brantford `` has been great to work with '' throughout the planning and construction period .
`` We believe in Brantford and we know the timing for a fresh hotel experience is now . ''
Brantford Mayor Chris Friel said the new hotel 's arrival is symbolic of the city 's rising prosperity
`` It 's the kind of ancillary activity that comes from a robust economy like Brantford has now , '' he said .
`` We ca n't keep up with the requests that are coming in right now . It 's really exciting and the quality of investment we got coming in , like this hotel , is fantastic . ''
Friel said investors are coming droves to the city .
`` It 's nothing like it used to be , when we had to bend over backwards to get any economic activity going . ''
Meanwhile , Tosh said he thinks visitors will like what the Holiday Inn Express will offer , including free WiFi , 55-inch high-definition TVs and plush beds . There also will be a complimentary hot-breakfast bar , a 24-hour fitness centre and an indoor swimming pool .
`` When it comes to hotel , residential or commercial spaces , we know our game , '' Tosh said .
`` We pride ourselves in creating a sense of uniqueness and individuality for each of our properties . ''

MULTAN-The traditional Chand Raat ( moon night ) festivities were underway when Hazrat Bibi , wife of Qari Abdul Ghafoor , a prayer leader at a mosque in Chowk Sarwar Shaheed , a remote village of Muzaffargarh district , felt labour pains .
Qari , already father of five girls , was highly excited as a recent ultrasound scan disclosed that his wife was expecting quintuplets , out of which three were baby boys and two girls .
But the couple never knew it was the beginning of a long ordeal , which would leave scars on their hearts and minds for the rest of their lives .
Hazrat Bibi gave birth to five premature babies on Eid day , 2nd of September , out of which three have so far lost their lives while two are alive .
“ Doctors are responsible for the deaths of my kids . First they denied my wife admission to all public and private hospitals during her highly critical labour condition and then they refused to admit my new-born quintuplets , ” blamed Qari while Talking to The Nation .
After having denied treatment and consequently losing three children — Abdullah , Muhammad and Sahra — in Multan , Qari travelled all the way to Toba Tek Singh district along with the remaining two kids — Ahmad and Zahra — to a charity hospital where they were placed in incubators in neonatal intensive care unit ( NICU ) . They are stable now .
Doctors across the world believe the chances of conceiving quintuplets are one in 50 million , making Hazrat Bibi and Qari Abdul Ghafoor a very special couple . But local doctors used quints as a pretext to refuse the family access to healthcare facilities , putting the lives of both mother and children in jeopardy .
A study published in The Lancet Medical Journal last year disclosed that Pakistan is ranked among the top ten countries in the world with the highest infant deaths , mainly because of poor or missing healthcare facilities . Similarly , a United Nations Children 's Fund ( Unicef ) report on state of children in Pakistan 2014 also points out that one in every 14 Pakistani children ( 7.1 % ) die before his or her first birthday , and one in every 11 ( 9.1 % ) do not survive to his or her fifth birthday .
District government sources revealed that an inquiry on the order of Deputy Commissioner Nadir Chattha is also underway in connection with the babies ' deaths and the report is likely to be submitted within a week . “ The two-member inquiry committee comprising Malik Muhammad Shafiq , Additional Deputy Commissioner ( HQ ) , and Mubashir Rehman , AC City , is investigating into the matter . “ The committee has been tasked with submit a report along with recommendations within seven days , ” sources pointed out .
The ill-fated couple went to at least five big public and private hospitals of Muzaffargarh and Multan twice — first on the night before Eidul Azha and then on Eid day — but the woman , who was in severe labour pains , was denied admission . “ We went to local hospital in Chowk Sarwar Shaheed , Tayyeb Erdoğan Hospital Muzaffargarh , Nishtar Hospital Multan , CMH Multan and City Hospital Multan but all of them showed us the door , saying no senior doctor was available to handle the case , ” said Qari while narrating his ordeal .
He said that eventually he returned home , performed the ritual of Qurbani , as it was Eid day , and again returned to Tayyeb Erdoğan Hospital , but to no avail . “ They sent us back again . We went to Muzaffargarh District headquarters Hospital where my wife gave birth to quintuplets in a normal delivery , ” he informed .
However , an even tougher part of Qari 's trouble begun from the delivery of babies . Each of the quints weighed 1.2 kg and they need immediate care at a neonatal intensive care unit ( NICU ) , which was missing at Muzaffargarh DHQ hospital .
“ I kept running from pillar to the post for 36 consecutive hours with my quints , all in a critical condition , to get them admitted to any NICU , but to no avail . Doctors at Nishtar and Children Complex Hospitals flatly refused to admit my kids , saying they did not have any incubators vacant , ” he regretted while recalling his ordeal .
“ I waited in the lawn of Children Hospital for three hours with all five babies in my lap in critical condition , waiting for doctors ' response . They returned with a weird offer , which too they withdrew after an hour , asking me to admit two babies here and take the remaining three to any other hospital , ” the dejected father revealed . He said that he also went to a private hospital on Abdali Road , who demanded Rs1.8 million for one month treatment .
In response to the accusations of Qari , the Medical Superintendent of Children Complex Hospital Dr Shahid said that a person namely Hayat Khan contacted DMS of the hospital and asked him to admit five newborn babies of Hazrat Bibi . He claimed there was space for only two children available in the hospital at that time so the man was asked to bring two children but he insisted that all five babies should be admitted altogether . He claimed that the man went away and did not return . “ Even we contacted Qari Abdul Ghafoor and asked him to join the inquiry but he refused to participate , ” he added . He claimed that there was no proof regarding negligence on part of any staff member of Children Complexes Hospital .
On the other hand , the poor father returned to Chowk Sarwar Shaheed and started treatment of the quintuplets at his home . A local doctor was called who put all the babies on oxygen support . However , the doctor advised the parents to take the babies to hospital as soon as possible .
“ After a great deal of efforts , the Nishtar Hospital administration accepted political safarish and admitted my quints to Ward No-19 on September 4 . Three of them were put in incubators while two others in nursery , ” he recalled , adding that after giving treatment for about 15 hours , the doctors at Nishtar started asking him to take the babies to Children Complex . In the meantime , one baby expired on September 7 and other on 9th , the ones who were in nursery without incubators . “ Finally , we were asked to vacate incubator on which we left the hospital and returned home . Another baby expired during this process . I 'll never forget callous behaviour of medics , ” he lamented .
However , Dr Nadir Bashir , Admn . Registrar of NICU , Nishtar Hospital , contradicted the allegations levelled by Qari Ghafoor and claimed that all the babies were entertained as serious patients , who were discharged on request of their father . In a written statement submitted by him during inquiry , he stated that the babies were admitted with the complaints of prematurity i.e 30 weeks and two babies were seriously ill who , inspite of all efforts , expired . He added that all the babies were examined by Professor , Assistant Professor and senior registrar on daily basis and written advices were available in the chart and progress sheet .
Declaring the deaths of newborns due to unavailability of healthcare facilities a complete failure of health system , Shahid Mahmood Ansari , District coordinator of The Child Rights Committee ( CRC ) , a non-profit body working for kids , said that a comparison of budgetary allocations for metros with the funds for health projects spoke volumes of rulers ' priorities . “ Women and children are dying due to unavailability of healthcare infrastructure . Children Complex hospital extension project , which is incomplete for about one decade , cancer hospital , kidney centre are the biggest examples of government 's disinterest in citizens lives , ” he maintained . He noted that the death ratio of newborn babies in South Punjab is much higher than other parts of the country . “ It 's because of missing maternity and childcare facilities . We strongly condemn government 's negligence and demand funds for Children Complex and other incomplete health projects . We also demand a strict action against the doctors responsible for the death of three babies of Qari , ” he demanded .
Multan Deputy Commissioner Nadir Chattha , while talking to this reporter , said that he had taken notice of the issue and had initiated an inquiry . “ We have sought explanations from the medical superintendents of Nishtar and Children Complex Hospitals . Their response is not satisfactory . So , we have constituted a two-member committee to hold an inquiry and submit its report and recommendations in seven days , ” he revealed .

Under Cellepathy 's software , “ driver mode ” blocks online features and social media , and some or all telephone calls that are n't of a vital nature . ( Photo : Ken Lambert / TNS )
In the near future , your phone might be smart enough to know whether you are driving a car , or going along for the ride .
Anti-distraction software by a tech startup called Cellepathy would automatically go into a restrictive “ driver mode ” when a phone is within a moving vehicle . Online features such as texts , video , games and social media would be blocked , as well as some or all nonemergency telephone calls .
Your cellphone is like an airplane 's black box . It contains a compass , a gyroscope , an accelerometer and GPS tracking .
Using those features and the software , vehicle passengers could perform a verification task , lasting seven seconds or less , to unlock all the apps in “ passenger mode. ” For instance , they would hold a phone level and type in a series of numbers .
Cellepathy co-founder Dan Abramson recently moved from Tel Aviv to the Seattle area , where he says the company will recruit engineers . The pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca in Israel and some European firms are requiring employees to use Cellepathy , which he said has begun to market to customers in North America .
“ Our contribution to the world is our ability to differentiate between drivers and passengers , ” he says , a useful goal until self-driving cars someday rule the road .
“ We can prevent a lot of deaths , injuries and tragedies over the next 40 years , and if we can make an honest wage for our efforts , that 's great . ”
Apple announced earlier this month its “ Do Not Disturb While Driving ” mode , to be installed in iOS 11 software this fall . Once a phone owner has chosen this mode , the iPhone would know when it 's in a moving car and automatically reply to an incoming call or message : “ I 'll see your message when I get where I 'm going . ”
Cellepathy-equipped phones would automatically go into driver mode when a car moves , unlike Apple 's feature , which is voluntary . No law now requires a driver 's phone to be disabled . Device makers oppose any government guidelines or mandates that call for software that automatically locks phones in moving cars .
“ Ultimately , this is a behavioral problem , ” said Jamie Boone , government affairs director for the Consumer Technology Association . “ There are tons of different distraction problems . Daydreaming , eating , putting on your makeup . ”
Cellepathy is marketing to companies that seek to improve safety and avoid liability for employees who drive on the job . That applies not only to fleets , but traveling salespeople , or anyone uses private cars to deliver food or packages .
Employers can order settings to allow calls , such as those to and from the boss . Calls to 911 would not be restricted . Employers typically allow finger or voice-activated maps , and music apps . Employers could configure Cellepathy software to either allow or block hands-free calls via Bluetooth , Abramson said .
Cellepathy is developed for Android phones and being beta-tested on Apple products , according to Abramson .

TOKYO : A mayor opposed to a U.S. Marines base on Okinawa seeks re-election in a poll on Sunday , raising the prospect that the facility will remain an irritant in Japan-U.S. relations .
Japan 's central government and Okinawa authorities have long bickered over a plan , first agreed between Tokyo and Washington in 1996 , to relocate the U.S. Marines ' Futenma air base from an urban area in central Okinawa to the less populated Henoko district of the northern city of Nago .
Nago Mayor Susumu Inamine and Okinawa Governor Takeshi Onaga are among the opponents of the move , seeking to have Futenma 's functions moved off Okinawa entirely . Prime Minister Shinzo Abe 's government wants to forge ahead with the relocation .
Many Okinawa residents associate the U.S. military presence with crime , pollution and accidents , and resentment has been rekindled by a spate of incidents involving U.S. military aircraft . In December , a window fell from a U.S. helicopter onto a school sports field , fanning safety concerns .
Inamine , who is seeking a third four-year term with opposition support , was leading challenger Taketoyo Toguchi , backed by Abe 's Liberal Democratic Party ( LDP ) and its junior coalition partner , the Komeito party , a Yomiuri newspaper survey published on Jan. 30 showed .
A win for Toguchi would make it easier for Abe 's government to carry through the relocation . A former local assembly member , Toguchi has pledged to improve the city 's economy .

Work is underway for construction of a Futenma replacement facility , but some aspects require approval from the Nago mayor , so the re-election of Inamine could bring delays .
Polls close at 8:00 p.m. ( 11:00 GMT ) and media exit polls are expected afterwards . Final official results may not be available until early on Monday .

SAN FRANCISCO : British cybersecurity researcher Marcus Hutchins pleaded not guilty on Monday to federal charges he built and sold malicious code used to steal banking credentials .
Hutchins , 23 , rose to overnight fame within the hacker community in May when he helped defang the global `` WannaCry '' ransomware attack , which infected hundreds of thousands of computers in May and caused disruptions at factories , hospitals , shops and schools in more than 150 countries .
He was arrested earlier this month in Las Vegas on unrelated hacking charges . U.S. prosecutors have claimed that he and an unnamed co-defendant advertised , distributed and profited from malware code known as `` Kronos '' between July 2014 and 2015 .
The case has drawn intense interest from the hacker community for the implications it may pose for cyber research and concerns it may deteriorate an often tense relationship between hackers and law enforcement .
Hutchins is a `` brilliant young man and a hero , '' his attorney , Marcia Hoffman , told reporters on Monday shortly after the arraignment .
`` He is going to vigorously defend himself against these charges , and when the evidence comes to light , we are confident he will be fully vindicated , '' she said .

The sold-out crowd of nearly 11,000 at Montreal 's Olympic Stadium cheered Black and Moors every step of the way .
`` It 's such an honour to be competing with such amazing girls , '' said Moors , who was awarded the elegance prize at the end of the competition . `` And the home crowd was amazing .
`` I did n't set any expectations for myself . I went in and just tried my hardest . ''
Black began the finals with a 14.600 on the vault and a 14.233 on the uneven bars . She scored a 12.866 on the beam , after losing her balance on a few occasions . Those dropped points ended up costing her the gold .
Despite a less than perfect performance on the balance beam , Black entered the final discipline in first place , two tenths of a point ahead of Hurd .
`` I knew what the general idea was going into the last rotation , '' said Black . `` But I try not to focus on that because the only thing I can control is the routine I was going to put out there .
`` I had a mistake on beam , and in the sport of gymnastics it always comes down to tenths . It was n't a perfect day for anyone here . ''
The 16-year-old Hurd performed first in the floor exercises , scoring a 13.733 .
Black needed a 13.534 or better on the floor to win gold , but she earned a 13.433 instead .
`` It 's crazy that I was even competing here , '' said Hurd , who finished sixth in all-around after qualifications . `` To think that I won is just the most surreal feeling in the world . ''
Black has a chance to win more medals over the weekend as she is also competing in three individual finals : vault , balance beam and floor exercises .
Moors ( floor ) and teammate Shallon Olsen ( vault ) are also in the running for medals in the individual finals on Saturday and Sunday .
Notes : American Ragan Smith , a favourite to win gold in the all-around , was forced to withdraw from the final after injuring her ankle during the vault warm up .

WildSafeBC is continuing to bring awareness to fawning deer after an increase in deer aggression in both Kimberley and Cranbrook over the last few weeks .
Community Coordinator for WildSafeBC Kimberley/Cranbrook , Danica Roussy says deer are normally timid animals , but if they become habituated to humans they can become a danger , especially when protecting their young .
If you find a fawn , it should be left alone , says Roussy .
“ A doe will often leave her fawn ( s ) alone for hours at a time while she feeds , returning throughout the day to nurse , ” she said . “ Scentless and silent , fawns may appear to be orphaned and helpless , but the best thing you can do for a fawn is to leave it alone . As soon as you remove that fawn from the bedding area , you are greatly decreasing its chance of survival . ”
She adds to stay on marked trails to reduce your chance of stumbling across a hidden fawn , and if you do come across one , be cautious as you may have come between a mother and her baby .
If you are approached by an aggressive deer , here are some tips from WildSafeBC for you to consider :
1 . Never approach a deer , especially if it has young with it .
2 . Deer may signal an impending attack by laying their ears back and lowering their head .
3 . If a deer does attack you – try to stay upright as they inflict injury by striking at their opponent with their sharp hooves . Cover your head with your arms and back off to some form of shelter .
4 . Please keep your dog on a leash when walking in city limits . If a deer does come towards you – let go of the leash – the dog can get away faster that way .
Deer are herbivores and have many natural predators . As such , they have developed keen senses to ensure their survival . A deer 's hearing is acute and their ability to articulate their ears allows them to pinpoint the sounds of any approaching predator . A dog looks like a predator to them ; as in the wild canines will predate on deer .
If you observe an aggressive deer , abandoned fawn , or other young animal that appears to have been left alone for an extended period of time , contact the B.C . Conservation Officer Service through the Report All Poachers Polluter ( RAPP ) hotline at 1-877-952-7277 . Residents can also report wildlife conflict other than bear , cougar , coyote , or wolf online at WildSafeBC 's Wildlife Alert Reporting Program ( WARP ) , available at www.wildsafebc.com/warp . This program allows you to see what wildlife has been reported in your neighbourhood and be alerted of new sightings .
The 2017-18 season marked the silver anniversary of what is regarded by many to be the best season in NHL history , 1992-93 . A quarter-century ago , Wayne Gretzky , Mario Lemieux , and Eric Lindros graced television sets . The Pittsburgh Penguins were going for a three-peat but fell short as the league 's most storied franchise , the Montreal Canadiens , captured their 24th Stanley Cup .
To commemorate the 25th anniversary , the upcoming NHL Network documentary Picture Perfect : The 1992-93 Season does a wonderful job presenting the greatness of that season . If you are too young to remember it or are a new fan , the documentary teaches you about it . Or , if you are old enough to remember what made that season great , Picture Perfect will foster nostalgia .
﻿
Use of Pictures to Tell a Story
As can be gathered from its title , photographs play a key role in telling Picture Perfect ‘ s story . It 's what sets it apart from other sports documentaries , especially fellow hockey ones . The film opens by showing a dark room where film is developed and then proceeds to present a still that represents a different storyline from the 1992-93 season .
The images are presented in chronological order , beginning with Eric Lindros at the 1991 Entry Draft , leading to his trade a year later , sparking the 1992-93 season , and ending with Patrick Roy hoisting the Stanley Cup with the Canadiens . In between are images of Lemieux that convey his electric start to the season , Gretzky discussing a career-threatening back injury , and Teemu Selanne taking the league by storm .
Using still photographs to tell a story in a fast sport like hockey seems impossible but it works . I feel this is because the film 's producers chose images that perfectly captured the essence of each moment . At the film 's conclusion , these images are shown having been framed and hung on a wall in chronological order in a way that even if someone had n't watched the documentary , basic player knowledge allows the story to be told .
Impressive Storytelling
Picture Perfect is told in a chronological fashion . It starts with Lindros being drafted , going unsigned for a full calendar year , and then his controversial trade from the Quebec Nordiques to the Philadelphia Flyers that changed hockey history for a decade . But , while it is chronological , it is not necessarily linear .
The storylines jump around between moments , themes , and players , but use excellent segues to do so . For example , after establishing the Lindros trade , the film highlights his first game against the Penguins but focuses more on Lemieux 's incredible start to the season , where he scored 36 points in his first 11 games .
From there , the film moves to Gretzky 's career-threatening back injury , the Canadiens ' attempt to break a seven-year Stanley Cup drought , and Selanne 's overtaking of Lindros as the league 's best rookie . All of these storylines except Selanne are revisited as the film advances , each with its own ups and downs .
Following Lemieux 's diagnosis of Hodgkin 's Lymphoma ( after which he ultimately returned better than before his radiation ) , Gretzky 's health returned and he led the Los Angeles Kings to their first Stanley Cup Final , and Roy played through trade rumors to win his second Cup .
This storytelling style succeeds because it takes audience members through each moment but never fully addresses each at one time . Using Lemieux as an example , his season started off great , the film cuts to other stories , comes back to Lemieux for his cancer diagnosis , his return , and his success after radiation .
“ There were always arguments about Mario and Wayne Gretzky , and he does n't hold all the records that Wayne Gretzky holds , but the people in Pittsburgh think he 's the best player that ever lived , and we have reason to because we saw the stuff he did that '92-'93 season. ” – Paul Steigerwald ( Former Pittsburgh Penguins Broadcaster )
Use of Interviews
No documentary , especially a sports documentary , is complete without interviews . In Picture Perfect , interviews go beyond being an addition to the film but are an integral part , as people present for the season are utilized .
The film interviews New York Rangers GM Neil Smith to discuss the team 's attempt to land Lindros at the 1992 Entry Draft . Others interviewed include broadcaster Gary Thorne , the Canadiens ' Kirk Muller and Guy Carboneau , Kings player Luc Robitaille and coach Barry Melrose , and NHL commissioner Gary Bettman .
That star-studded cast helped present all facets of the season , including opposing views of the Stanley Cup Final . Additionally , to hear Lemieux talk freely about facing cancer or have Melrose discuss that the main reason he took the Kings job was to coach Gretzky , only to have him miss the first three months of the season , was spectacular and something only a well-thought-out documentary can accomplish .
An interview that stands out to me was Gretzky being asked about his health scare , his return from injury , and his ability to lead the Kings . He admitted to struggling in the Conference Final against the Toronto Maple Leafs , where received criticism as a result . Entering Game 7 in Toronto , a security guard told Gretzky that he was n't looking forward to his 10:30 shift that night because when the Leafs won , the city would go crazy . To that , Gretzky replied :
“ Do n't worry about your 10:30 job , because my job starts at 7:30 . ”
Gretzky and the Kings beat the Maple Leafs 4-1 that night , with Gretzky producing four points and providing the hockey world with a storyline that could n't be made up .
Seriously , Watch It !
If you are a hockey fan , and I 'm assuming you are to be reading this , you will love Picture Perfect . It has something for everyone . There is history , controversy , and sad valleys with great peaks .

A season that started with a blockbuster trade was capped by the most storied franchise winning the Stanley Cup for the 24th time . But while those moments were spectacular and would have made the 1992-93 season dynamic on their own , it was the moments between the beginning and end that established the season as one of the best in league history . And on the 25th anniversary of that storied season , Picture Perfect celebrates it with the reverence it deserves .
Picture Perfect : The 1992-93 Season airs on Friday , June 1 at 8:00 p.m. on the NHL Network .
When Amelia Earhart vanished from the skies over the South Pacific , she largely became her disappearance . Decades have passed , yet her name still evokes speculation as to what may have happened to the famed aviatrix and her navigator Fred Noonan . Did they simply run out of fuel and plummet into the ocean ? Did they touch down on some tropical atoll ? Were they captured by foreign agents ?
We 'll never know for certain the fate of Earhart and Noonan . What is known is the unparalleled impact she had on a generation of Americans , who saw in her a fearless and determined counterpoint to the despondency of the Great Depression . Young women , in particular , were taken with Earhart 's iconoclastic manner which flew in the face of mores of the time .
Nowhere today is that spirit and zeal for adventure better documented than at the Purdue University Archives and Special Collections , which houses over 5,500 items from Earhart 's personal papers .
“ Amelia Earhart was a rock star in the thirties , ” says Tracy Grimm , the Barron Hilton Archivist for Flight and Space Exploration at the Purdue Archives . “ She went against society 's rules , and she did n't do it in a real blatant way . She did it in a very subtle and smart way , challenging women 's roles in society . ”
From her correspondence with such notable figures as First lady Eleanor Roosevelt to her prenuptial agreement with husband and manager George Palmer Putnam , the items in the collection paint a portrait of Earhart few today remember .
“ When you look through the collection and see the breadth of her papers you start to see the complexity of the individual , ” Grimm notes . “ Behind every legend there is a human being . ”
Earhart 's connection to Purdue began in 1935 . Nominally a visiting faculty member , she served as a technical adviser to the university 's Department of Aeronautics in addition to being a guidance counselor of sorts to women concerning their careers .
“ President [ Edward C. ] Elliot had heard her speak in New York City and she spoke about how a woman could have a career just like a man , ” says Grimm . “ He wanted to bring her to Purdue because , in the thirties , we had quite a large population of women students . She was invited to live here and work with them , to be a role model and to encourage them to have careers of their own . ”
It was during her time at Purdue that Earhart began planning her ill-fated trip around the world , with the university even providing the funds to purchase the Lockheed Model 10 Electra she would pilot .
When it became clear that Earhart was never going to be found , Putnam made the decision to donate her personal papers to Purdue , owing not only to their commitment to aviation education , but also to the vast opportunities that the university offered to women .
The continuing mission of the Purdue Archives is one of preservation and education , Grimm explains . One of the most gratifying elements of being a steward of such a collection is watching as children discover Earhart 's incredible tale of courage , tenacity and perseverance .
“ Her legacy at Purdue is really important because it inspires students . Kindergarteners all the way up to twelfth want to come to Purdue and be like Amelia , to fly planes or maybe just do something that is out of the ordinary . ”
It 's second nature to most diners but the practice of tipping may be making female servers more vulnerable to sexual harassment .
From rude customers to sexist employers , Eric Nordal got fed up with what he saw in his 15 years working in the restaurant industry and is now an activist .
“ I just saw so many people , so many of my friends that were just being abused or let down by their employers or customers . It 's painful to watch , ” Nordal said .
Nordal helped launch the Retail Action Network in Victoria last year .
The non-profit helps workers in retail , food service and hospitality however they can .
Their efforts range from legal education , putting pressure on employers or lobbying the government for legislative change .
“ We 've easily had over 100 people come through the door and a lot of them stick around to volunteer , ” Nordal said . “ They 're coming back because they 're seeing years ago these things happened to them and they wish they could have done something . ”
University of Victoria PhD candidate , and former server , Kaitlyn Mateluwicz also joined the Retail Action Network and hopes her research will help .

Mateluwicz said hers is the first in-depth study on sexual harassment in restaurants in Canada .
She found that low wages and a dependence on tips puts female servers in vulnerable situations .
“ I heard stories about inappropriate touching , questions about the worker 's sex life , innuendo like , ‘ I like the way you bend over , ' ” Mateluwicz said .
“ Women are disproportionately affected by this because 81 per cent of servers and bartenders in B.C . are women . ”
While the Retail Action Network helps workers in many industries , there is a focus on restaurants and bars .
In B.C. , liquor servers earn $ 1.25 less than minimum wage , legislation the non-profit is hoping will soon be history .

AMSTERDAM : Turkey has sentenced a judge at a U.N. war crimes court to 7 years and six months in prison on charges of `` membership in a terrorist organization '' , the court in the Hague , Netherlands said on Thursday .
Judge Aydin Sedaf Akay has been held since September , one of tens of thousands of Turkish officials arrested in a crackdown on people and organisations after a foiled coup in which hundreds died .
The U.N. court said in a statement that Turkey 's actions violated international law , as Akay should enjoy diplomatic immunity .
( Reporting by Toby Sterling ; editing by Ralph Boulton )
This statement was originally published on rsf.org on 25 May 2018 .
Reporters Without Borders ( RSF ) condemns this week 's decision by Benin 's High Authority for Broadcasting and Communication ( HAAC ) to close one of the country 's most popular newspapers , the pro-opposition La Nouvelle Tribune , for insulting President Patrice Talon . The decision is disproportionate and lacks a legal basis , RSF said .
`` La Nouvelle Tribune is finished . On to the next one , '' a cartoon on the newspaper 's front page said yesterday , a day after the HAAC issued its decision to close it until further notice for `` conducting during recent months an insulting and offensive campaign violating the Head of State 's privacy and using a degrading vocabulary . ''
Under article 55 of the 1992 law establishing the HAAC , it can only close a media outlet when the outlet violates this law 's own provisions . But the decision published by the HAAC on 23 May cites provisions on press ethics , insult and respect for privacy in Benin 's information and communication law and press ethics law , neither of which says this kind of offence is punishable by closure .
When reached by RSF , HAAC president Adam Boni Tessi refused to make any comment about this decision .
`` There are no legal grounds for the HAAC 's decision , '' said Arnaud Froger , the head of RSF 's Africa desk . `` Closing a newspaper on the basis of laws that do not provide for this form of punishment is absurd and the punishment seems out of all proportion to the alleged offences . As long as the HAAC continues to arbitrarily close media outlets critical of the authorities , it will be seen as a government tool . ''
The Benin Union of Media Professionals ( UPMB ) and the National Council of Print and Broadcast Media Owners ( CNPA-Benin ) have issued a joint statement `` questioning the HAAC president 's real motives '' and saying there are `` no valid arguments justifying the closure of what is a space for freedom . ''
The HAAC ordered the closure of four opposition broadcast media outlets in December 2016 . Three of them are now back on the air but one , Sikka TV ( owned by the president 's leading political rival , Sébastien Ajavon ) , is still unable to resume broadcasting despite a court ruling in May 2017 ordering its reopening . Tessi , who was already the HAAC 's president , was himself ordered to pay 76,000 euros in damages .
Benin fell six places in RSF 's 2018 World Press Freedom Index and is now ranked 84 out of 180 countries .

LAHORE-Strongly moving towards its release at the end of this year , the highly-anticipated movie Rangreza 's aesthetically powerful poster has been released .
The poster shows the main cast of the movie , Bilal Ashraf , Urwa Hocane and Gohar Rasheed as depicted in their roles . Following Janaan 's widest release for a Pakistani film internationally , Rangreza is now set to break a new record number of countries as part of its worldwide distribution strategy , establishing a whole new benchmark for Pakistani cinema on a global platform .
Making one of the most expensive Pakistani film productions to date , Rangreza is a musical romance directed by Aamir Mohiuddin , featuring Gohar Rasheed , Bilal Ashraf , Urwa Hocane and Saleem Miraj in the principal cast .
Musical legend , Abida Parveen , features prominently on the sound tracks , composed by the film 's writer , Akhtar Qayyum . The film is presented by Vision Art Films , Usman Malkani Films , Distribution Club ( PVT ) Ltd , Munir Hussain Films UK and Pepe 's Piri Piri and will be distributed worldwide by B4U Motion Pictures .
Munir Hussain , Head of Munir Hussain Film UK says , “ I 'm very excited to bring another highly anticipated film , which will showcase the growing strength of Pakistani cinema . We have some creative plans in place for the release , ” he said .

Mumbai : Unheralded , anonymous but starry-eyed , Yashasvi Jaiswal and Jwala Singh are perhaps two sides of the same coin .
It was Jwala , who first saw the fire in Jaiswal 's eyes and the spring in his steps , as he wandered around for life 's basic necessities , plus an opening in cricket .
There was not enough food and no proper shelter , but the 17-year-old Jasiwal battled the odds and is now primed to make the India U-19 team for the tour of Sri Lanka , alongside a certain Arjun Tendulkar .
`` I had gone to Azad Maidan ( in South Mumbai ) in 2013 , when I saw him ( Yashasvi ) practising , when he was 11-12 years-old , when he was facing A division bowlers . A friend of mine told me that he plays well , but was going back to his village in Uttar Pradesh , '' Jwala said .
Jwala runs a cricket academy in suburban Santacruz .
For three years , Jaiswal slept with groundsmen in a tent belonging to the Muslim United Club inside the Azad Maidan premises in Mumbai . Before that , he worked in a dairy shop , where he used to sleep for the night .
Recalling the days gone by , Jwala added , `` He had the lot of problems and there was no one to support him . I asked where does he stay and was told that he stays at the tent of the Muslin United ( Club ) . I was shocked , and after he was done with batting , I spoke to him .
`` He told me that he was from Bhadoi and stayed here ( at the tent ) and was heading back as he felt that his cricket was over .
`` I asked him to meet me . He showed me his ( cricket ) file and ( it ) looked impressive . I told him that I will make arrangements for his stay . ''
Then on , life took a turn for better for Jaiswal .
`` From that time , his parents have never interfered . I took a lot of extra efforts on him when I felt that he could make big . I worked on his batting . He did not have strength .
He had a fear that he wo n't play cricket and it was important to drive out the fear , '' the coach added about the boy who hails Bhadohi in Uttar Pradesh and is one of the two sons of a shopkeeper .
Once he discovered Jaiswal , Jwala said , he tried to make the middle-order batsman technically , mentally and physically strong .
`` I took him to Juhu beach for fitness . He was an under-privileged child , as he did not get proper diet . There were also other issues , which needed to be worked on .
`` We worked on him for hours and now he has become stable . He was handling other issues and he too worked hard on it . ''
Jwala said the U-19 selection could be a big break in Jaiswal 's journey .
`` He is a talented player . At the end of the day , he is just 17 and if he performs well , he will go ahead . He has special ability , '' said Jwala .
According to former Mumbai U-19 coach Satish Samant , the left-handed batsman was always focussed on realising his dream .
`` He never told me about his background and never took advantage of it . I did not know about it ( the background from where he came ) . He is away from social media and he would be a one-off boy , who is so much focused at his age , which is good sign , '' Samant , who had coached Jaiswal in the Mumbai U-19 team , said .
JERUSALEM : Police investigators began questioning Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at his official residence in Jerusalem on Monday on suspicion of receiving gifts from businessmen in breach of his role as a public servant , Israeli media said .
The move was authorised by Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit , who decided after a preliminary inquiry that there was enough evidence to open a criminal investigation , Haaretz newspaper reported .
Israeli media said the questioning by senior police investigators began on Monday evening , was expected last several hours and would almost certainly be followed by more interrogation .
Netanyahu told his ruling Likud faction in parliament that those hoping for his downfall would have to `` wait with the celebrations , do n't rush . I 've said it before and I 'll say it once again : there will be nothing because there is nothing . ''
Photographers were camped outside the heavily guarded residence , hoping to get pictures of investigators arriving . Black screens were erected inside the gates of the property to block the view .
Haaretz and other newspapers said the probe related to gifts worth `` hundreds of thousands of shekels '' ( US $ 1=3.85 shekels ) given to Netanyahu by Israeli and foreign businessmen .
Channel 2 , a commercial network , said the investigation was one of two cases now open against the prime minister , although it said details of the second remained unclear .
Netanyahu , 67 , has been in power on and off since 1996 . He is currently in his fourth term as prime minister and will become Israel 's longest-serving leader if he stays in office until the end of next year .
He and his wife , Sara , have weathered several scandals over the years , including investigations into the misuse of state funds and an audit of the family 's spending on everything from laundry to ice cream . They have denied any wrongdoing .
Netanyahu is not the first prime minister to be questioned in a criminal case .
Ehud Olmert , who held office from 2006 to 2009 , is currently serving 18 months in prison after being convicted of breach of trust and bribery in 2014 .
Former prime minister Ariel Sharon was questioned while in office in 2003 and 2004 over allegations of bribery and corruption involving him and his two sons . In 2006 , his son Omri was convicted of corruption and served time in prison .
Netanyahu 's police appointment drew a barrage of commentary from the centre-left opposition in parliament , with politicians calling for him to go . But Yair Lapid , leader of the centrist Yesh Atid party , said that for the good of the country , he hoped the prime minister would be cleared .
`` I wish for him and his family , and the State of Israel , that we uncover that there was no fault in his behaviour . If two prime ministers in a row fall from office because of corruption , it will be very hard to rehabilitate the public 's trust in its leadership . ''
Israeli commentators pointed out that while Netanyahu may be questioned , it has happened many times in the past and prime ministers have gone on governing , sometimes for years .

The new head coach of the Eastern women 's basketball team Matt Bollant brings proven success to a program that has not had a winning record since the 2012-13 season .
Bollant becomes the ninth head coach of the Panthers and he has been a winner in many of his 15 years of head coaching . He started his head-coaching career at Bryan College for five years , followed by five years at Green Bay and five years at the Illinois . He has an overall record of 343-149 and reached the postseason in 11 of his 15 years .
Much of Bollant 's success came during his five years at Green Bay where he reached the NCAA Tournament four times along with winning the Horizon League five years in a row . He won the Horizon League Coach of the Year four times and in 2015 at Illinois he won the Kay Yow Heart of a Coach Award .
Along with his history of winning comes the success in the classroom from his student-athletes . Bollant has had his team among the top of the conference each year in team GPA and graduation rate .
“ Every single player that I have coached has graduated and we will do that here as well , ” Bollant said .
Bollant takes an active role to make sure his players are excelling in the classroom as well as the court . The active role he takes is by asking them about assignments that are coming up and gives them a date to do that assignment or else they will not be practicing .
Athletic Director Tom Michael took notice to the success in the classroom past teams under Bollant have had during the hiring process .
“ His commitment to the academic side and what he has done in the past is something that is important to us , ” Michael said . “ We want all of our programs , all of our coaches and all of our student-athletes to excel in the classroom and that is what they are coming her ultimately is to use that degree . Certainly sport allows that to be a vehicle for them to be more successful when they leave Matt has demonstrated that everywhere he went . ”
Junior Grace Lennox will be entering her senior year with a new coach and has played an active role to keep the team practicing during the month-long coaching vacancy .
“ We were playing at the gym six days a week and continuing to do individuals for 30-45 minutes three times a week . We had a graduate assistant from the men 's team bringing us along with that , ” Lennox said .
Bollant acquires a young team that had just one senior on it last year and will begin practicing with his new team this week . Eastern had a record of 9-19 and 5-11 in conference last season .

New Delhi : With the farm loan waiver pitch getting shriller by the day , former RBI governor Y V Reddy on Monday said the practice is not good for `` economic or credit culture '' and insisted that ultimately it is a political decision and can not be justified in the longer run .
Even former RBI governor C Rangarajan took a similar line , saying the alternative is to offer farmers a longer window to pay off .
Reddy noted that every political party in India has offered such waiver in some state or the other or at an all-India level .
`` Loan waiver is not good for economic or credit culture . Every political party in India has given farm loan waiver in some state or the other or at all India level . So , ultimately it is a political decision , it can not be justified in the longer run , '' he said on the sidelines of the Inclusive Finance India Summit 2017 .
Rangarajan observed that instead of waiving farm loans , the government should give longer time to farmers to repay loan or perhaps waive the payment of instalment and rate of interest in that particular year .
`` First thing to do is waiver of interest payments during the year of distress , second reschedule the loans so that the farmers will get a longer timeframe for repayment and finally , if all these things do n't succeed , then the government should think of farm loan waiver , '' Rangarajan suggested .
Both the former RBI governors ' remarks assume significance , coming in the wake of such announcements by Punjab , Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra .
Recently , Congress leader Rahul Gandhi too tried a similar pitch during his campaign for Gujarat elections by promising farmers loan waivers if his party forms the government in the state .
In 2008 , the government wrote off farm loans to the tune of Rs 74,000 crore .
Rangarajan pointed out that increase in growth rate in the second quarter of the current fiscal indicates that the slowdown is bottoming out .
`` My own assessment is that in the next two quarters , rate of growth will be 7 percent so that on an average for the year , GDP growth will be 6.5 percent , '' Rangarajan said .
On surge in Bitcoin prices , Reddy said , `` It is better we take a definitive view on Bitcoins . I think the main problem for the government and the central bank is to decide what to do ( with Bitcoins ) , everybody is aware that it ( Bitcoin ) is a big problem , '' he added .
On sidelines of the same event , former RBI deputy governor H R Khan said investment in Bitcoins is `` dangerous '' and people should understand this .
Earlier , participating in a panel discussion with former RBI governors Bimal Jalan , D Subbarao and Reddy , Rangarajan said financial inclusion is not an option , but a compulsion .
Jalan 's prescription is inclusion has to be combined with financial stability .
Subbarao explained that India is a large country and what works in Nagaland may not work in Kerala , which is why `` we should have a diversified model for financial inclusion '' .
Former deputy governor Subir Gokarn moderated the session .
Chance the Rapper brought in 24 with a bang on Sunday .
The “ No Problem ” rapper used his celebration — which he dubbed “ Chance the Birthday ” — at Studio Paris Nightclub in Chicago as an opportunity to raise $ 100K for his charity , SocialWorks , which focuses on empowering youth through the arts , education , and civic engagement .
“ The night was a huge success with Chance 's ability to rally the community to donate for a great cause , ” says managing partner of Studio Paris , R.J. Melman . “ We are proud to play a part in it and are honored to have been chosen by Chance as the place to throw his party . ”
Chance 's birthday began with a private reception at il Porcellino , a casual-chic Italian restaurant , where the rapper and friends enjoyed food , cocktails and a one-of-a-kind birthday cake , a source told us .
The tiered white , green and red dessert was decorated with what appeared to be french fries and chicken wings cascading down the side and paired with a Mistic drink .
The source added that the birthday boy “ spent the night enjoying himself with friends and fans at his table ” at Studio Paris .
The crowd was surprised with a musical treat when T-Pain and Ludacris asked Chance to join them on stage to perform “ All I Do Is Win . ”

Tech billionaires Michael Dell and Bill Gates collect trophies—trophy hotels , that is . Both men have sunk millions of dollars into high-end hotels , like a Four Seasons resort in Hawaii owned by Dell and a Four Seasons resort in Mexico owned by Gates .
“ I do n't mean for this to be pejorative and I do n't mean to malign anyone , but there is some cachet to being able to ‘ play ' with a hotel , ” says Daniel Marre , co-chairman of the hotels and leisure practice at Seattle-based law firm Perkins Coie LLP .
For a lot of other high-net-worth investors , however , trophies are merely shiny objects that gather dust on a shelf . Increasingly , these HNW investors would rather snap up more modest hotels—like a Hilton Garden Inn or a Courtyard by Marriott—in secondary and tertiary markets , thereby eschewing prestige in favor of profit .
According to a report from commercial real estate services company JLL , full-service hotels in the high-end category accounted for more than two-thirds of single-asset deals in the third quarter of 2017 . Transaction volume during the quarter totaled $ 6.4 billion , with publicly-traded REITs , private equity funds and foreign investors driving the bulk of those deals .
Since major league players have put top-tier hotel acquisitions squarely in their sights , a number of HNW investors are targeting deals elsewhere . And HNW investors are just fine with that , as trophy hotels in primary markets tend to draw a slew of bids from well-capitalized institutional investors .
Mike Cahill , founder and CEO of Hospitality Real Estate Counselors , a consulting firm based in Greenwood Village , Colo. , says family offices in secondary and tertiary markets like Cleveland , Denver and Omaha , Neb . typically feel comfortable buying stable cash-on-cash lodging assets—either on their own or in conjunction with other family offices—in non-gateway markets scattered around the country .
“ But if you 're in a for a roller coaster ride , then by all means , buy a trophy property in a major city , ” Marre says .
Marre uses a baseball analogy to describe the trophy-or-no-trophy approach to hospitality investing for HNW investors . “ If you want to swing for the fences , that 's fine , but also understand that you have more of a likelihood of striking out , ” he says . “ If you want steady stats , just go for the singles and doubles . ”
More and more HNW investors , including family offices , are going for those singles and doubles by chasing income-producing hospitality investments outside gateway markets , according to Adam Docks , co-chairman of the hotels and leisure practice at Perkins Coie . HNW investors pursuing non-gateway hospitality properties tend to focus on second-tier markets , including Austin , Texas , Minneapolis , Nashville , Tenn. and Seattle , he says .
“ If a high-net-worth investor is looking for some capital appreciation and income , there 's nothing wrong with investing in a branded select-service hotel in a secondary or tertiary market , ” Docks notes . “ You can get nice returns off those . ”
Statistics from Portsmouth , N.H-based hotel consulting firm Lodging Econometrics bear out the popularity of the types of hotels you 'd find in a secondary or tertiary market . Through the third quarter of this year , 686 hotels whose selling prices are publicly available were sold in the U.S. , according to Lodging Econometrics . Those properties had an average sale price of $ 134,204 per room and an average room count of 127 .
When scoping out hospitality assets , regardless of size and stature , HNW investors typically prefer one-off deals over portfolios , Docks says . “ Portfolio transactions are complicated and they 're really tough to execute , and a high-net-worth investor or family office may not have the team or resources necessary to take down an entire portfolio of hotels . ”
HNW individuals and small family offices lacking in-house asset managers usually hand off oversight of acquired hotels to third-party operators , according to Marre . That 's an especially important step for investors who do n't have experience in the hospitality industry .
Aside from the burden of running a hotel , Marre stresses that the financial success of lodging assets is less predictable than that of , say , office or industrial properties . Thanks to the prevalence of long-term leases for office and industrial buildings , forecasting income and expenses is simpler than it is for hotels , whose occupants are more transient and whose fortunes are closely tied to the economy .
“ Hotels are such a different asset than any other class of real estate , ” Marre says . “ With hotels , you have to price every single room every single night . That 's the nature of hotels ; it 's a roller coaster ride . It 's almost like the canary in the coal mine for the economy . ”
The roller coaster ride can pay off handsomely , though . In secondary and tertiary markets , an investor can expect a cap rate of 8 percent to 11 percent for a hotel , with yields in the high teens , Cahill says .
“ There are n't very many investments out there today that bring those types of yields , ” he says .

Mumbai : The BJP unit in Maharashtra is prepared for mid-term polls , Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis said in Mumbai on Wednesday .
Fadnavis made the remarks in reference to reports speculating mid-term polls in Maharashtra amid farmers ' stir seeking loan waiver in view of the agrarian crisis .
The Fadnavis dispensation had announced the long-standing demand of the waiver last Sunday .
`` Some people said ( when the agitation was on ) that they will bring the government down , will withdraw support . I said we are ready for mid-term polls .
`` If someone wants to impel us to go for mid-term polls , I am confident we will be able to form the government again , '' Fadnavis told reporters here without naming any party .
Buoyed by the BJP 's success in Maharashtra local governing bodies ' polls , held in the recent past , Fadnavis exuded confidence that people of the state were with the saffron party notwithstanding various agitations against the state .
`` This success was unprecedented and no other party achieved such success . The Congress-NCP could n't attend the success even during their hay days . So , people believe in the government , '' he said .
Talking to a Marathi news channel recently , Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut had suggested that the Shiv Sena would withdraw support to the government if the loan waiver was not announced .

Joey Logano knows time is short to make the playoffs
BROOKLYN , Mich. With three races left before the playoffs start , Joey Logano is on the outside looking in . His failure to qualify so far is arguably the biggest surprise of the Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series season in terms of performance .
He admitted at Michigan International Speedway to feeling desperate , but he sees the closing stretch of regular-season races as really good for him , particularly Bristol and Richmond .
Bristol is probably one of our best racetracks as well , especially in the fall race ,  said Logano , driver of the No . 22 Team Penske Ford Fusion .
He has two career wins at Bristol in 17 starts . He also has two wins at Richmond . He won there in the spring , but a rules violation meant the win was declared encumbered , so it does not lock him into the playoffs . Darlington is the only weak spot in the group . His average finish there is 18.4 , and he has just two top 5 finishes in eight starts .
I dont look at that race track ( Darlington ) and say we dont have a chance ,  he said . I feel like well still be fine there , it just might be a little bit different.
Logano is too far back to points-race his way in , so his team is likely to take aggressive chances to try to grab a win .
Every moment becomes more and more important on the racetrack , and thats OK ,  he says . Thats where you find out what youre made of , so Im all right with that.
ROOKIE DANIEL SUAREZ 'S TOP 10 STREAK ENDS AT MICHIGAN
Coming into this weekend , Joe Gibbs Racing 's Daniel Suarez was on a streak of four consecutive top-10 finishes in the Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series and was looking to make it five . Unfortunately his day was cut short after tangling with Kasey Kahne late in the race .
Kahne , driver of the No . 5 Hendrick Motorsports Chevrolet SS , was attempting to pass Daniel Suarez for position on Lap 139 . But he pulled up before he cleared Suarez . The contact slammed Kahnes right side into the outside wall just past Turn 2 ending his day . He finished 38th .
We had to fight from the back and had a good LIFTMASTER Chevrolet , '' Kahne said . `` We kept working to get up there . Daniel ( Suarez ) was going backwards and I was going by and I ran the bottom . I expected we could be close off the corner , and I was just coming off and then we hit.
Suarez was having another good run in the first stage of the race in the No . 19 Joe Gibbs Racing Toyota Camry , but in the final stage he started to struggle with a tight racecar before the incident .
I was trying to give him some room , but actually I got out of the throttle at that point , but I dont know if he was told it was already time to go up  I dont know . Its just unfortunate because we came from a streak of top-10s , and now this is going to be the end of it ,  said Suarez , who finished 37th . Were going to regroup and come back stronger next week.
MICHIGAN 'S ERIK JONES PONDERS A WIN AT HIS HOME TRACK
Of course Erik Jones thought about it . How could he not ?
With the race halted by a red flag for a little over five minutes with just two green flag laps left in the Pure Michigan 400 on Sunday at Michigan International Speedway , Jones let his mind wander to what it would be like to win the race .
Not only would it have been the first win of his Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series career and lock him into the postseason , but it would have come at his home town track . A native of Byron , Mich. , Jones grew up 99 miles from the racetrack .
 ( The red flag ) gives you a lot of time to play through scenarios on the restart and how you want it to work out . Its very rare it ever works out the way you picture it in your head ,  he said . And this one didnt , either . Instead , Jones settled for third .
He would have had to beat his teammate to get that win . Jones was second on the final restart alongside his Furniture Row Racing teammate Martin Truex Jr .
Before the question could even be asked , Truex said flatly Furniture Row Racing does not have so-called team orders and that there was no chance he would let Jones win .
Jones can not make the Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series playoffs on points , and will have to win one of the next three races to make the postseason .

Foreign Minister Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu and his German counterpart Heiko Maas recently voiced their determination to retain the positive trend in bilateral ties , reports said .
Speaking on the sidelines of a United Nations meeting , Çavuşoğlu and Maas exchanged views on the state of the bilateral ties between Ankara and Berlin . According to diplomatic sources , the meeting on the 21st floor of the German U.N. embassy lasted just over half an hour and was described by the German side as a `` good conversation in a constructive atmosphere . ''
Also , the two ministers agreed to keep the positive trend in the normalization process of bilateral ties afloat , sources said . Maas reportedly suggested that `` positive signals from recent months will be followed by further constructive steps in the German-Turkish relationship . ''
Recently , the announcement of early general and presidential elections to be held on June 24 in Turkey led to heated debates in Germany . The German foreign minister said earlier this week that Turkish politicians would not be allowed to hold electoral events on German soil due to concerns emanating from the propaganda period prior to the April 16 , 2017 referendum .
The German minister had already made it clear before the conversation that the ban on campaigning for foreign officials three months before a vote in their country also applies to Turkish politicians . According to sources , the matter was brought up in the bilateral meeting .
Çavuşoğlu is expected to travel to Germany on May 29 to speak at an event in Solingen on the 25th anniversary of a right-wing extremist arson attack that killed five members of a Turkish family . This event was also vehemently opposed by some German politicians on the grounds that it be could turn into a political platform .
However , Maas ensured that , `` This is an event that takes place on a regular basis where the victims of this terrible arson attack are remembered . ''
Earlier in March 2017 , then Justice Minister Bekir Bozdağ and Economy Minister Nihat Zeybekci were prevented from holding meetings in Germany prior to the April 16 constitutional referendum . During the constitutional reform referendum campaign , Ankara sharply condemned such obstructions by European countries , comparing them to the practices of fascist regimes during World War II and also accused these governments of taking sides in Turkey 's referendum by favoring the `` no '' campaign .
The bilateral ties between Ankara and Berlin breathed a sigh of relief after German human rights activist Peter Steudtner , translator Meşale Tolu and journalist Deniz Yücel were released from Turkish detention in October . There have also been others whose names have not been disclosed by Turkish or German authorities . Former German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel 's close relationship with Çavuşoğlu had also helped diplomatic efforts in making ties better between the two allies .
On the other hand , Germany has slightly upped the pressure on supporters of the PKK . The number of preliminary proceedings launched against suspects increased from 15 in 2013 to 130 in 2017 , a spokesman for the Federal Prosecutor 's Office told a German news agency earlier this year . Also recently , German police raided a PKK-affiliated organization in Hannover in central Germany earlier this month . The Public Prosecutor 's Office said police searched the office of NAV-DEM in Hannover on suspicion of support for terrorism . `` Several people are suspected of supporting the PKK 's illegal structures in Germany and recruiting Kurdish youth for the PKK , '' Frank Padberg , spokesman for the Public Prosecutor 's Office in Luneburg , said .
Tom Brady has added to his greatest-of-all-time resume by winning his third AP NFL MVP award for the 2017 season . This ties him up with Jim Brown , Brett Favre and Johnny Unitas — Peyton Manning is the only player with more at five .
The announcement was made on Saturday night before Super Bowl LII , and Brady could not attend because of his preparation for the big game on Sunday . Although Brady only has three MVP awards , he has five Super Bowl wins in seven appearances , including four Super Bowl MVP awards .
Brady 's season was tightly contested with Todd Gurley and Carson Wentz before he went down with an ACL injury . Gurley had a phenomenal season , but Brady at the age of 40 years old was just too impressive .
Brady received 40 votes , Gurley received eight votes , and Gurley received two votes .
Brady threw for 4,577 yards and 32 touchdowns , while only throwing eight interceptions.He also pulled his team to a 13-3 overall record during the season , even though the defense started off with below average performances . His season was spectacular , and bringing this team to another Super Bowl is just a testament to Brady 's greatness this season .
Brady is heading into his eight Super Bowl and could possibly win his fifth Super Bowl MVP award , all of this will build this incredible career . He is also the oldest to win the award .

Day 3 report : Ross Taylor scored his 17th Test century to equal the New Zealand record Monday and to put his team fully in control of the second cricket Test against the Windies .
Taylor made an unbeaten 107 to join current captain Kane Williamson and Martin Crowe on the record before New Zealand declared at 291-8 , setting the Windies an unlikely victory target of 444 with two days remaining .
The Windies , who will have to beat their world record for the highest winning fourth innings score in Test cricket — currently 418 against Australia in 2003 — were 30-2 at stumps . Opener Keiran Powell was out for a duck to complete a pair for the match and Shimron Hetmyer fell for 15 , seven minutes before stumps on day three .
Captain Kraigg Brathwaite was 13 not out and Shai Hope was on 1 , and the Windies still trailed New Zealand by 414 runs .
Taylor kept up his close competition with Williamson to become the first New Zealander to score 18 Test centuries when he reached his hundred Monday from 172 balls . Williamson missed the chance to stretch the record mark when he was out earlier on the third day for 54 .
Taylor had also missed an opportunity to equal the record when he was out for 93 in the first innings of the first Test at Wellington , where New Zealand won by an innings and 67 runs .
With his innings Monday , Taylor set up New Zealand 's declaration late in the day and Williamson achieved his objective by taking two wickets in the short interval of 36 minutes before stumps . Powell was caught at slip by Tim Southee from the bowling of Trent Boult , and Hetmeyer chipped a catch to Neil Wagner at mid-off from Southee 's bowling .
`` When I started my career I never thought I 'd even get to play Test cricket let alone get 17 centuries , '' Taylor said .
The milestone was more poignant for Taylor because he equaled the mark first set by Crowe , who helped guide him in his Test career at times when he struggled to fully realize his potential . Crowe died of cancer last year aged 53 .
`` The team situation was first and foremost in our minds and it was nice to get out there and get a bit of a score , '' Taylor said . `` You never want to think a game is safe but to get a lead over 400 is satisfying . ''
Taylor said the Windies made batting difficult with their best bowling performance of the series on Monday and he had a life when he was dropped in the gully on 35 .
The determination of the West Indies not to surrender meekly was made evident by a fiery spell of fast bowling by Miguel Cummins immediately after lunch on day three . Cummins allowed his team to win back some ground from New Zealand who had dismissed the tourists for 221 Monday in reply to their first innings of 373 , a lead of 152 .
He took 2-22 from the six over-spell , dismissing Williamson with a sizzling yorker and removing Henry Nicholls ( 5 ) with a superb bouncer . He then unsettled Mitchell Santner with a sustained spell of short pitched bowling , striking the New Zealand allrounder on the helmet .

by Joe Lacey today at 9:33 pmThe growth in participation was driven in part by the new Multi 2000 class – which was won by Charlie Capelle sailing the immaculately renovated Accapella , a sister-ship to Mike Birch 's 1978 Route du Rhum winner Olympus.The Diam 24 trimarans are also growing in number and Spi Ouest provided perfect training for 33 boats who are preparing for this years Tour de France a la Voile.Another growing class is the 2-handed IRC division . JPK 10.80 's LS-Resa and Bouznik finished first and second in a 34 boat fleet which competed in one long coastal race each day.IRC 1 was a battle between two Grand Soleil 's – and it was the GS43 Codiam , with former 505 world champion Nicolas Loday at the helm , who came out on top against GS44 Spirit of Spineck , skippered by 2016 Solitaire du Figaro champion Yann Richomme.In IRC 2 the podium positions where shared by the same teams as in 2016 , but this time it was Didier Le Moal 's J112 J-Lance ahead of the JPK10.80 's Dream Pearls and Leon.IRC 3 was arguably the most competitive class this year , with many of France 's top Figaro sailors joining the fun in a fleet dominated by JPK10.10 's and Sunfast 3200 's . OGIC took a well deserved win ahead of Raging Bee in second.IRC 4 was won by Alain Guelennoc 's X332 Riwannon III ahead of the Surprise Indigo and Half Tonner Brittany Drizzle.More than half of Spi Ouest 's entrants raced in one-design classes , the largest of which was the J80 class with 67 entries this year . Inigo Jaurigui 's Gold Sailing Team made the trip from Spain to take the win , with double world champion and Olympic gold medallist Jose Maria van der Ploeg in second and French national champions Eric Brezellec / Géry Trentesaux in third.The other stand-out one-design class was the Open 7.50 's – with local sailor Nicolas Groleau 's Bretagne Telecom team finishing ahead of two Dongfeng boats – with Marie Riou in second and Charles Caudrelier in third.Multihull sailing and 2-handed sailing are two growth areas in our sport and our club will be working hard over the next year to make sure these fleets continue to flourish . We hope as many of you as possible join us for the 320 mile ArMen Race in May ( www.armenrace.fr ) , the IRC 2-handed Duo Cat-Amania in June ( www.duocatamania.com ) , or indeed Spi Ouest next year !

There is compelling evidence to suggest that Lorde has been secretly posting onion ring reviews on Instagram for a while now . As the New Zealand site Newshub points out , Lorde recently followed an account called @ onionringsworldwide on Instagram . The account has only 24 followers , many of whom are Lorde associates , and it follows nobody else . When Newshub contacted Lorde 's management to ask about the account , and to ask whether Lorde really is into onion rings like that , they did n't respond , but the account was taken down shortly afterward . But the internet is forever , and screenshots are out there
Is this Lorde 's secret onion ring Instagram account ? https : //t.co/Ch0KBsNtOr pic.twitter.com/JbEPwFrciH — Newshub ENT ( @ NewshubENT ) June 13 , 2017
I ca n't breathe Lorde has been exposed for running an onion ring instagram pic.twitter.com/yYjFuUGUu7 — tony ( @ tohneigh ) June 13 , 2017
Dedicated sleuthing has revealed that Lorde momentarily had a side gig reviewing onion rings on Instagram https : //t.co/jdOBnbdEXn — New York Magazine ( @ NYMag ) June 13 , 2017
Newshub has all the screenshots from the deleted Instagram ; check it out here . The site also notes that many of those onion rings , which come from eating establishments around the world , come from places within driving distance from wherever Lorde was at the time , like a “ charter plane from Tennessee to New York . ”

And there are other pieces of evidence , as well , including its use of Lorde-ish language and , more creepily , the fact that the fingers in the pictures look like they could be Lorde 's fingers .
In any case , it 's weirdly awesome to think that one of our greatest young pop stars could also be a massive onion ring head , the type who travels to seek out the best onion rings available , and who has to share that obsession with the world , even in clandestine form . If that 's really you , Lorde , please never stop Instagramming onion rings . ( Also , all of those onion rings look great , and I am suddenly reminded that it 's just about lunchtime . )
The first scene of a movie is often its defining moment : In subtle and large ways it lets the audience know where they are , where they 're going — and often , what to expect along the way . But deciding on that first major statement can be a challenge ; sometimes , a main character dancing to “ Thriller ” in the bathroom mirror is the wrong choice .
Here , directors and editors from nine awards-season contenders share why they began their films as they did – and what alternate openings were abandoned along the way .
Tom Cross ( editor , “ La La Land ” )
First scene : Amid an all-too-familiar massive L.A. freeway backup , a musical number breaks out and our hero and heroine meet cute while sparring with one another in their cars .
Revelations : “ Damien [ Chazelle , director ] wanted to introduce our characters in a memorable way , but also their world : La La Land , ” says Cross . “ Our characters dream big , so it was important that the film start with a bang . ”
Alternate reality ? “ The original plan was to open with a main title sequence that would serve as an overture . We eventually lifted out the overture and put the traffic number ahead of the intro . What was airtight on the page had been transformed through the shooting , and re-editing achieved the original spirit . ”
The cost of school crossing guards will grow by about $ 580,000 over the next two years as the minimum wage rises to $ 15 an hour , a report to the upcoming Toronto Police Services Board shows .
Toronto Police employ 769 school crossing guards who earn hourly wages ranging from 11.90 to $ 14.44 -- depending on years of service .
Premier Kathleen Wynne is boosting the current minimum wage of $ 11.60 an hour to $ 14 on Jan. 1 , and then to $ 15 on Jan. 1 , 2019 .
The police board estimates the increased cost of bringing school crossing guards up to the new minimum wage will be $ 230,900 in 2018 and $ 352,400 in 2019 , says the report to Thursday 's police services board meeting .
Mayor John Tory said he does n't begrudge the crossing guards a pay boost given the important work they do protecting children .
“ It 's not as if they were paid an exorbitant amount of money before , ” Tory said Sunday . “ And it 's not as if they even get that many hours ... They work in this split shift arrangement , in the morning and afternoons . ”
However , any time another level of government , usually the province , makes changes that impose costs on municipalities , it can be very challenging , he said .
“ They simply have not given us , over time , the flexibility with respect to how we raise money to pay for a lot of this stuff , ” Tory said . “ And it 's very frustrating for me as a mayor and I 'm sure for other mayors . ”
For example , cannabis legalization brings a host of new responsibilities for cities , and provincial policies around funding shelters “ substantially prejudices ” Toronto , he said .
The only reason that the school crossing guard pay hike would even be an issue is because it comes on top of a lot of other financial obligations that the city must shoulder , he said .
The provincial government has sent funds for some priorities , including supportive housing , he said .
But the mayor noted he does receive a lot of mail from other levels of governments pleased to inform him of new mandated initiatives .
“ And then there 's no cheque in the envelope , ” Tory said .
The City of Toronto budget committee has already considered the impact of minimum wage hikes on its bottom line -- about $ 2.3 million over the next two years for parks , forestry and recreation staff alone , and millions more for other labour law changes , including three-hour standby pay and paid emergency leave .

VANCOUVER : A female stunt driver has died on the set of “ Deadpool 2 ” in downtown Vancouver during the filming of a stunt on a motorcycle , Vancouver police said on Monday .
Local media reported that the stuntwoman appeared to lose control of the vehicle , which drove off the set and through the window of a building across the street .
A representative for movie studio 20th Century Fox , a unit of Twenty-First Century Fox Inc. , did not immediately respond to Reuters for comment .
The sequel to the 2016 superhero movie “ Deadpool ” starring Ryan Reynolds is being filmed in Vancouver .

When the teaser of Ajith 's latest film , Vivegam , was released at midnight on Thursday , 11 May 2017 , it crossed 1.6 million views in an hour — making it the fastest a million views for a south Indian film 's teaser .
Now , a teaser for a song from Vivegam — titled 'Surviva ' — has gone viral on YouTube , garnering over 696,959 views within the space of a few hours .
A verse from the song was released on YouTube and features singers Anirudh Ravichander and Yogi B in the studio as they record it . The lyrics — a mix of Tamil and English — are by Yogi B , while the music , with heavy hip-hop and electronic influences , is composed by Anirudh . The teaser has a rap by Yogi , while Anirudh provides the refrain .
Unfortunately for fans , there are no vignettes featuring Ajith in the 'Surviva ' teaser .
Vivegam marks the third time Ajith — or Thala , as he is addressed by fans — is teaming up with director Siva . Ajith plays an Interpol agent on the hunt for the world 's biggest terrorist ( played by Vivek Oberoi ) . It is being pitched as a James Bond-esque espionage thriller .
Vivegam also features Kajal Agarwal and Akshara Hassan in key roles . The film is expected to release sometime this year , although no date has been announced so far .
Watch the teaser for 'Surviva ' here :
CHIANG RAI , Thailand ( Reuters ) - Rescue teams in northern Thailand were giving crash courses in swimming and diving on Wednesday as part of complex preparations to extract a young soccer squad trapped in a cave , and hoping for a swift end to their harrowing 11-day ordeal .
Divers , medics , counsellors and Thai navy SEALS were with the 12 schoolboys and their 25-year-old coach , providing medicines and food while experts assessed conditions for getting them out safely , a task the government said would not be easy .
“ The water is very strong and space is narrow . Extracting the children takes a lot of people , ” Deputy Prime Minister Prawit Wongsuwan told reporters .
“ Now we are teaching the children to swim and dive , ” he said , adding that if water levels fell and the flow weakened , they would be taken out quickly .
By late on Tuesday , about 120 million litres of water had been pumped out , or about 1.6 million every hour .
It was unclear what the options were to get the “ Wild Boar ” team out of the Tham Luang caves in Chiang Rai province and how they would be steered through tight , fluid conditions and uncertain weather .
Experts say divers have required three hours to reach the boys , located about 4 km ( 2.5 miles ) from the mouth of the cave .
A group of about 30 divers in wetsuits was seen preparing kit and heading for the caves on Wednesday , accompanied by military personnel and a foreign cave expert .
A video released by the SEALS showed two rescuers seated on an elevated part of the cave beside boys wrapped in emergency foil blankets who appeared to be in good spirits , occasionally laughing .
A torch is shone on each boy , who says hello and introduces himself with head bowed and palms pressed together in a traditional “ wai ” greeting .
A young player wears what appears to be the red jersey of the England soccer team in Tuesday 's World Cup second-round victory over Colombia . Another wears the blue shirt of English team Chelsea .

NIGHTMARE OUTING
The group was discovered by the SEALS and two British cave diving experts on Monday , having been incommunicado since June 23 , when a post-practice outing went awry , prompting the high-profile search and rescue effort .
News that the team had survived sparked relief , celebrations and an outpouring of praise in a country transfixed by the drama and its almost blanket media coverage .
Chiang Rai Governor Narongsak Osottanakorn said the authorities were keen to get the boys out and suggested it might have to happen in phases , but only when safe .
“ All 13 do n't have to come out at the same time , ” he told reporters . “ Who is ready first can go first . ”
Officials have dismissed as speculation reports that the boys could be trapped for up to four months , although supplies have been prepared for that period of time .
Weerachon Sukondhapatipak , a deputy government spokesman , said there was much work to be done in preparing the boys for what could be a demanding task , and rescue teams should not be pressured to act faster .
“ Some of them ca n't swim , so therefore it will take time for them to adjust , ” he said .
“ Officials would teach them how to move , how to dive , how to move their body under those circumstances . ”
Somboon Sompiangjai , 38 , said his son Peerapat , 16 , was able to swim , adding that he was confident the SEALS ' experience and professionalism would let them get the boys home safely .
“ I am not worried if the kids have to swim and dive , ” he told Reuters .
“ I felt much better after seeing the clips with the children in good spirits , even though they were in there for 10 days . ”

EXPAND There are some weird conversations happening out there . Mathew Tucciarone
Every year at Coachella , we set out to pick up on the best things heard in passing on the polo fields . They 're bits and pieces of people 's adoration for the performers that move them , utter confusion about getting where they 're going and , sometimes , drug-induced ponderings .
Here are 25 of the most oddball and hilarious — especially when heard out of context — things overheard this year .
25 . This was actually the very first thing I heard when I got through the gates .
`` You should have a morning poop , an afternoon poop and a night poop . That 's , like , a healthy diet . ''
24 . Not usually the kind of question you shout at a band , but Tall Juan took it in stride .
`` Where 'd you fly in from ? ''
`` Mars ! No , from Argentina . ''
23 . Only three hours in and this security guy had had it .
`` Stop doing drugs ! Stop doing drugs ! ''
22 . I 've been there too , Surfbort .
`` This one 's about waking up and being like , 'Where 's all my shit ? ' ''
21 . Does anybody actually though ?
Girl shouting at Mac DeMarco during his set : `` I do n't get you ! I really do n't ! ''
20 . One of the more far-out Coachella rumors this year .
`` You think Snoop Dogg is gon na show up for Radiohead ? ''
`` Foshizzle ! ''
EXPAND Surprisingly , Snoop Dogg did not make an appearance during Radiohead 's set . Maybe he bailed because of all the sound issues ? Mathew Tucciarone
19 . Then , these two dudes said this :
`` If they play 'Creep ' I 'm gon na make out with you . ''
`` Now I 'm excited . ''
18 . The Radiohead frontman does have a reputation for being a bit of a miserabilist .
`` I can just imagine every time the audience claps , Thom 's just like , 'Those do nothing for me ! ' ''
17 . Despite the fact that Radiohead left the stage twice because of sound issues ...
`` That was still better than Drake . ''
16 . The beginning of day two .
Girl yawns in the crowd .
Other girl : `` No ! I do n't want to catch it ! Noooooo ! ''
15 . At least it looked like he was having a good trip .
`` I did way too many mushrooms . Waaaay tooooo maaaany . ''
14 . From a bro passing a buff guy wearing a bunny rabbit head , Speedo with bunny tail and nothing else :
`` You should be charging for pictures , bro ! ''
EXPAND Somewhere up there , Warpaint are casting spells . Mathew Tucciarone
13 . This dude at Warpaint :
`` They 're straight up doing witchcraft . I have no idea what they 're doing . ''
12 . `` I will go buy an iced coffee for anyone who gives me a fat nug right now . ''
11 . Apparently , Future 's surprise guest was n't for everyone ...
`` How was Drake ? ''
`` He was good , but all the girls around me just kept screaming 'Daddy ' at him the whole time , so that was kind of weird . ''
10 . Selfie turf is a real thing , I guess ?
`` Can you please go over there ? You 're in my picture . ''
`` Bitch , you 're in my picture ! Move ! ''
9 . Day three : The final stretch for tired limbs and brains .
`` Sitting in this beanbag chair is better than any hug I 've ever gotten . ''
8 . There 's a lot of sweating .
`` My spray tan is making my pit stains orange . ''
7 . And a lot of drugs .
`` I think if every hair on your head had a name it would be like every name in America . ''
6 . Devendra Banhart brought out a little girl to sing , and this woman could barely contain herself :
`` Are you freaking REAL right now ? ! ''
EXPAND Lebo M. , left , and Hans Zimmer , getting their Lion King on Matthew Tucciarone
5 . Hans Zimmer and his orchestra performed The Lion King theme and it was a really big deal .
`` I was so excited I peed a little . ''
4 . Teenage girls acted at gatekeepers to Lorde 's show .
`` I 'll only let you through if you 're actually here for Lorde and not just Kendrick . ''
3 . And this one might be just a little obsessed :
`` I want your face and your hair and your clothes and your voice and your life and I want you ! ''
2 . Everything the singer did impressed us .
`` She 's drinking water with a straw ! She 's so fucking classy . ''
1 . And the very last thing I hear before exiting the festival ?
`` How did she get a giant inflatable dick in here ? ''
The Miami Dolphins wore their perfect season uniforms , and for at least one game in 2017 , they looked the part .
Tom Brady was intercepted twice by Xavien Howard and held without a third-down conversion Monday night , and Miami snapped the New England Patriots ' eight-game winning streak with a surprising 27-20 victory .
The Dolphins ( 6-7 ) were 11-point underdogs at home , but they kept the Patriots ( 10-3 ) from clinching their ninth consecutive AFC East title — at least for another week .
“ It was a bad night , ” Brady said . “ We 've had a lot of good nights this year . This was a bad night . ”
Brady went 24 for 43 for 233 yards and one touchdown . Miami sacked him twice and hit him five times , and held the Patriots to 25 yards rushing . New England was 0 for 11 on third down .
“ Our focus every game is to hit the quarterback as hard as we can and make him uncomfortable , ” defensive tackle Ndamukong Suh said . “ I think we did a pretty good job of it . ”
The Dolphins ' Jay Cutler threw for 263 yards and three scores , including two to Jarvis Landry . Kenyan Drake had 114 yards rushing and 79 receiving .
A Brady touchdown pass cut the deficit to 10 points with 13 minutes left , but the Patriots ' next three possessions netted 5 yards . After a New England field goal , Miami sealed the victory by recovering an onside kick with 53 seconds to go .
“ This gives us a boost , ” Cutler said . “ Winning is what keeps you in this game . The locker room after a game , there 's nothing like it . ”
The Dolphins wore their 1972 uniforms , and for the first time in four prime-time appearances this season , they rose to the occasion . Miami tried to turn the game into a laugher in the third quarter when Landry caught a touchdown pass and then set the ball down in the end zone and pumped it repeatedly — a reference to the Patriots ' Deflategate scandal .
“ It 's all about taking the air out of the ball , ” Landry said .
Coach Adam Gase beat New England for the first time in four tries . His team snapped the Patriots ' 14-game road winning streak , second-best ever behind San Francisco 's 18 in a row from 1988-90 .
Gase threw a lot of wrinkles at the Patriots early , with tight end MarQueis Gray and receivers Landry and Jakeem Grant taking turns lining up in the backfield .
“ We used a lot of guys , ” Cutler said . “ We were mixing it up . Adam was dialing it up well . ”
Cutler spun out of the grasp of blitzing safety Jordan Richards to throw a completion that kept Miami 's first touchdown drive going .
The 5-foot-7 Grant made a leaping catch against Malcolm Butler his first career touchdown reception , a 25-yarder .
Meanwhile , the Patriots sputtered without tight end Rob Gronkowski , who served a one-game suspension for a late hit to the head of an opponent .
“ We got beat in all three areas of the game , ” coach Bill Belichick said .
BALL HAWK
Brady underthrew an open Brandin Cooks deep , and Howard closed for the interception and a 29-yard return to set up a touchdown . Howard also had two interceptions a week ago against Denver .
Brady came into the game with only four interceptions all season .
SLOW START
The temperature was 55 degrees at kickoff — frosty by Miami standards — and the Patriots were sluggish from the outset . They were outgained 123 yards to 2 in the first quarter , when Brady went 0 for 4 with an interception .
ANTHEM
The Dolphins ' Kenny Stills , Michael Thomas and Julius Thomas knelt in protest during the national anthem , as they 've done for most of the season . Stills was nominated by his teammates last week for the NFL 's Walter Payton Man of the Year Award .
INJURIES
Patriots DT Alan Branch left the game with a knee injury . Starting S Patrick Chung limped off in the final minute .
UP NEXT
The Patriots visit AFC North champion Pittsburgh on Sunday in a possible playoff preview .
The Dolphins play the Bills in two of their final three games , including Sunday at Buffalo .

Save your life but harm your heart ? Health experts are sounding a warning as potential side effects of a growing number of breast cancer treatments come to light .
In its first statement on the topic , the American Heart Association on Thursday said women should consider carefully the risks and benefits of any therapies that may hurt hearts . Not all treatments carry these risks , and there may be ways to minimize or avoid some .
“ We want patients to get the best treatment for their breast cancer , ” said Dr. Laxmi Mehta , a women 's heart health expert at Ohio State University who led the panel that wrote the statement . “ Everyone should have a conversation with their doctor about what are the side effects . ”
There are more than 3 million breast cancer survivors and nearly 48 million women with heart disease in the United States .
“ Most people with breast cancer fear death from breast cancer . Even after they survive that , they still fear it , ” but heart disease is more likely to kill them , especially after age 65 , Mehta said .
Some treatments for other types of cancer may pose heart risks , but they are growing more common for breast cancer patients and the statement addressed only that form of the disease .
Here are some questions and answers :
Q : What are the problems and which treatments can cause them ?
A : Side effects can include abnormal rhythms , valve problems or heart failure , where the heart slowly weakens and ca n't pump effectively . Symptoms may not appear until long after treatment ends .
Herceptin and similar drugs for a specific type of breast cancer can cause heart failure . Sometimes it 's temporary and goes away if treatment is stopped , but it can be permanent .
Radiation can affect arteries and spur narrowing or blockages . Other drugs can lead to abnormal heart rhythms or artery spasms , which can cause chest pain and possibly lead to a heart attack . Still others can damage DNA .
Some research suggests that powerful new drugs that harness the immune system to fight cancer may , in rare cases , cause heart damage , especially when used together .
“ The problem is , no one has this on their radar , ” so patients are not routinely checked for it , Dr. Javid Moslehi , head of a Vanderbilt University clinic specializing in heart risks from cancer therapies , said when a study reported this problem about a year ago .
Q : What can be done to avoid harm ?
A : If heart failure develops early during breast cancer treatment , sometimes therapy can be slowed down or altered .
Certain chemotherapies such as doxorubicin , sold as Adriamycin and in generic form , might be less risky if given more slowly , rather than all at once . Some research suggests that a drug called dexrazoxane may minimize damage if given to women with advanced breast cancer who are getting high doses of doxorubicin .
Q : What can patients do ?
A : Women should make sure doctors are monitoring their heart before , during and after breast cancer treatment .
The diseases share many common risk factors such as obesity , smoking and too little exercise , so reducing these can help .
“ Make sure you 're working on your diet , exercise , managing your weight , following up with your doctor on your blood pressure and cholesterol , ” Mehta said .
So now the Notley hypocrite government of Alberta plans to take over ownership of the Trans Mountain project and vows to fight to the finish to get it built . Neither the province nor the Liberal feds will fight for free enterprise ownership of the pipeline but will fight for socialist and nationalist ownership . Folks , welcome to the Canadian Socialist Bolshevic Republic . Absolutely disgusting ! Think I would rather live in Putin 's Russia . At least the privileged leader is intelligent and political correctness is non-existent .

A firefighter from Dewsbury has described how he feared the worst whilst saving the life of a toddler who got into difficulty at a swimming pool on holiday .
Stefan Taylor was on a break in Turkey with his young family when he was alerted to a three-year-old boy who had been submerged for nearly four minutes .
Springing into action , the 34-year-old began performing CPR whilst a fellow holiday-maker , incredibly also a firefighter , performed mouth-to-mouth .
“ When he was pulled out of the water he was gone , ” he said , “ His eyes were open , he was blue , there was no sign of life . We performed on him for two and a half minutes and got nothing back from him . Everyone around us was shouting and screaming , his mother was beside herself .
“ We carried on for several seconds and felt a movement , some colour came into his face and all of a sudden he started coughing and crying .
“ I 've never felt anything like it , it was a tremendous feeling of just pure relief .
“ I 've saved people before in my job but not like that . I was in holiday mode with no equipment , it was a totally different experience .
“ I 'm an atheist and I always have been , but I found myself praying to God , which was unusual . I felt like I was trying to save the life of my own child . ”
Seconds after the child responded , paramedics arrived to rush him to hospital . He has fully recovered , but had he spent any more time underwater , Stefan said , it could have been a tragedy .
“ Once you get to four minutes or more you begin to suffer brain damage , ” he said , “ everything was very surreal , that we got to him just in time as well .
“ The whole thing felt like time had slowed down and everyone around the pool was hysterical as you can imagine . I 'm just glad we were able to help him . ”
David Williams , secretary of the West Yorkshire Fire Brigades Union , said that whilst incredible , the story was typical of Dewsbury-stationed Stefan and the firefighting service as a whole .
He said : “ From our point of view , it 's indicative of firefighters everywhere . They 're brilliantly trained and the fact is that you never fully switch off , even on holiday .
“ We 're here to make a difference and when we get the opportunity to do so , we do .
“ It 's no surprise to hear that Stefan behaved in the way that he did . He 's that type of bloke - really dogged and determined in everything that he does and an absolute credit to the fire service . ”

ISLAMABAD - Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif Sunday strongly condemned the terror attack at Istanbul , Turkey on New Year 's eve .
The prime Minister in a message said Pakistani people shared the grief of Turkish people and stood by them , in this most painful time . `` Terrorism is our common enemy and the world needs to put up a joint fight against this menace , '' the prime minister said .
He said Pakistan itself has suffered great losses of lives and property by terrorism and would continue to ensure all measures for its eradication .
The prime minister on behalf of the people and government of Pakistan , extended his heartfelt condolences to the Government and people of Turkey on the loss of precious human lives in the attack .
Meanwhile , the Foreign Office also strongly condemned the terrorist attack at a nightclub in Istanbul and expressed deep anguish as `` terror and tragedy has struck brotherly Turkey again . ''

BRUSSELS : Nervous European allies put a brave face on the troubled debut of President Donald Trump 's administration , expressing confidence in U.S. engagement with NATO as they prepared to hear from Trump 's defence chief at talks in Brussels on Wednesday .
The meeting at NATO headquarters is seen as an opportunity for Defense Secretary Jim Mattis to reaffirm U.S. commitment to European security after an election campaign in which Trump appeared to question the value of the alliance .
His administration was jolted again this week by the resignation of national security adviser Michael Flynn , who was seen in Moscow as a leading advocate of warmer ties with Russia .
But NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg dismissed concerns about the turmoil or U.S. backing for NATO .
`` I 'm absolutely certain that the message of this meeting will be a message of transatlantic unity , of the importance of that we stand together and protect each other , and a very strong commitment of the United States to NATO , '' he told reporters .
Britain 's defence secretary echoed that mantra .
`` There is no uncertainty about America 's commitment to NATO , '' Michael Fallon told reporters when asked about the Flynn 's resignation . Denmark 's Claus Hjort Frederiksen said everything he had heard was `` calming and reassuring . ''
Still , European allies are expected to privately seek details from Mattis about Trump 's attitude toward the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation , which has guaranteed Europe 's security for almost 70 years .
Trump has deeply unsettled allies with his contradictory remarks on NATO - calling it `` obsolete '' but also voicing support - and with his praise for Russian President Vladimir Putin .
Moscow 's 2014 annexation of Crimea , Ukraine 's Black Sea peninsula , and its direct support for rebels in eastern Ukraine have prompted NATO to begin sending alliance troops to Russia 's borders to deter the Kremlin from any other moves . The White House said on Tuesday that Trump expected Russia to hand back Crimea to Ukraine .
One senior European NATO diplomat said allies are under no illusion that Trump might not still undo careful diplomatic work with a single message on Twitter . But they would still look for his support as they try to manage tensions with Russia .
`` We need to bring the family together , '' the diplomat said . `` Things have been made to feel fragile . ''
INCREASED SPENDING
In his debut trip to Europe as Pentagon chief , Mattis is set to echo longstanding U.S. calls that European allies invest more on defence , something his predecessors under Republican and Democratic administrations have done for years .
But experts say that message will have to be calibrated , because while Trump has eased off his criticism of NATO since taking office , he has maintained criticism of some allies for failing to make `` full and proper financial contributions . ''
NATO Europe argues it is increasing defence spending , upping outlays by US $ 10 billion last year .
NATO defence ministers from Europe , Canada and Turkey will also want to hear from Mattis , who will be first to address the 27 other defence ministers on Wednesday , on how the alliance can meet Trump 's demands to do more to counter Islamic militants .
NATO says it is already active , training troops from Afghanistan to Iraq , and can not do the work of police or social workers seeking out returning foreign fighters from Syria .
`` We need to be clear that the response to international terrorism can not be led by NATO , but it can a part of that , '' a second senior European NATO diplomat said .

Here 's what we know so far :
Johanna Konta got her 2017 campaign off to a bright and confident start as she breezed into the second round of the Shenzhen Open .
The British number one , seeded third here , looked sharp as she beat Cagla Buyukakcay 6-2 6-0 .
Konta broke Buyukakcay on her opening serve and then again on her third to go 4-1 up .
Although the Turk broke back to make it 4-2 , Konta immediately returned the favour for a 5-2 lead , and she was never troubled again .
Konta looked in ruthless mood throughout the second set , and Buyukakcay finished the match having saved only two of the eight break points against her .
Konta will now face American Vania King in the second round .
Differences should not lead to disputes in relations between India and China , Defence Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said on Tuesday as she met her Chinese counterpart General Wei Fenghe in the backdrop of the strain in ties between the two countries after the Dokalam standoff.Sitharaman , who arrived on Monday , attended the SCO defence ministers ' meeting on Tuesday.During her meeting with Fenghe , Sitharaman said that differences should not lead to disputes in relations between India and China , officials said.In August last year , India and China ended their 73-day standoff between their troops in Dokalam .

Students from the Florida high school where 17 people were fatally shot last month expect more than 1 million participants in upcoming marches in Washington and elsewhere calling for gun regulations , students said Monday .
More than 800 March for Our Lives demonstrations are planned around the world Saturday , sparked by the Feb. 14 shooting in Parkland , Florida .
`` It just shows that the youth are tired of being the generation where we 're locked in closets and waiting for police to come in case of a shooter , '' Alex Wind , a junior at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School , told The Associated Press .
`` We 're sick and tired of having to live with this normalcy of turning on the news and watching a mass shooting , '' he added .
Since the massacre , Stoneman Douglas students have been at the forefront of a push to tighten gun restrictions and protect schools .
They have led rallies and lobbied lawmakers in Washington and Florida 's capital , Tallahassee . Last Wednesday , tens of thousands of students around the U.S. walked out of their classrooms to demand action on gun violence and school safety . Stoneman Douglas students fanned out Monday to discuss the marches with media outlets in New York , including NBC 's `` Today '' show and `` CBS This Morning . ''
The National Rifle Association did n't immediately respond to an inquiry Monday about the upcoming marches .
Amid the wave of activism , Florida passed a law curbing young peoples ' access to rifles . Some major U.S. retailers decided to curb on the sale of assault-style rifles or stop selling firearms to people younger than 21 .
But Congress has shown little appetite for new gun regulations . President Donald Trump at one point proposed raising the minimum age for buying an assault rifle to 21 but then backed off , citing a lack of political support .
The Republican president has since released a school safety plan that includes strengthening the federal background check system and helping states pay for firearms training for teachers , while assigning the buying-age issue to a commission to study .
A petition associated with Saturday 's march calls for banning sales of assault weapons and large-capacity ammunition magazines , as well as tightening background checks .
The suspect in the Parkland shooting , 19-year-old former student Nikolas Cruz , used an AR-15 assault-style rifle , according to authorities . His lawyer has said he will plead guilty in return for a life prison sentence , rather than possibly facing the death penalty .
The Associated Press reported Sunday that documents show some officials recommended in September 2016 that Cruz be involuntarily committed for a mental evaluation , though the recommendation was never acted upon . Such a commitment would have made it more difficult , if not impossible , for Cruz to get a gun legally .
Beyond making a statement , Saturday 's marches aim to make political change by registering and mobilizing people to vote .
But the students insist their aim is n't partisan : `` We 're just trying to make sure that morally just people are running this country , '' Stoneman Douglas senior Ryan Deitsch told the AP .
As soon-to-be voters , the students say they 're here to stay in the public debate .
`` We are not just a presence on Twitter . We are not just some social media fad . We 're not like Tide Pods , '' Deitsch said , referring to the laundry detergent packets that recently sparked a dangerous social-media-fueled trend of teenagers eating them .
`` We 're trying to push this idea that we have a voice , that people can speak out , and that that voice should be heard , '' Deitsch said .
Former Burbank Police Lt. Rick Madrid was a big man with a big smile . He had a bigger-than-life personality and sense of humor , and an even bigger heart .
When that big heart suddenly and unexpectedly stopped beating on Dec. 3 , the news spread rapidly , hitting hundreds of people , from diverse walks of life , who knew and loved him , like a devastating thunderclap .
He was 61 years old .
More than 520 of those who had known Madrid gathered to remember and pay their respects to the Burbank-born graduate of St. Finbar Elementary School , College of the Canyons and the FBI National Academy in Quantico , this past Sunday at Paramount Pictures Studios Theater .
A 1981 Medal of Valor recipient , Madrid worked his way up the ranks at the Burbank Police Department , became known as the “ Sergeant to the Stars , ” and then , following a promotion , the “ Lieutenant of the Luminaries ” — monikers he earned by establishing relationships and friendships with executives , actors and personalities in the music , film and television industries .
During the years Johnny Carson held the reins of “ The Tonight Show , ” Madrid provided security during the taping of the program , as an escort when Carson left the studio after tapings , and even at the entertainer 's Malibu home .
He served on the Burbank police force for 31 years and , just two days after retiring in 2006 , joined Paramount Pictures as the studio 's chief investigator .
Former Burbank Police Chief Tom Hoefel , a close friend of Madrid 's who now lives in Texas , presided over the memorial service .
Hoefel smiled as he watched people arrive , walking a red carpet to indicate that each attendee had been a VIP in Madrid 's life .
“ A red-carpet arrival for a memorial service , ” he said , shaking his head . “ That is just so Rick . He would be humbled and secretly trilled by this turnout of so many people he loved . ”
One of those walking the red carpet was former Burbank Police Capt . Janice Lowers , who had attended the police academy with Madrid and then came up through the ranks alongside him .
“ I cry every time I think about his passing , ” Lowers said . “ I just ca n't process . It 's like losing a brother . ”
Inside the theater , members of Madrid 's family , including his wife of 36 years , Carol , daughter , Drue , son , Kenny , parents , Al and Pat , sister , Cathy , and brother , Bobby , sat in the first row .
Among the notables in attendance were former Burbank Police Chief Tim Stehr , current Chief Scott LaChasse , a contingent of former and current sworn and civilian representatives of the police department , former Burbank Fire Chief Mike Davis and former Mayor Mary Lou Howard .
“ Rick was a phenomenal representative of the BPD , ” Hoefel said . “ He was also a persistent name-dropper who would always talk about Garth doing this , or Angelina doing that . ”
During the following two hours , speakers , who included Madrid 's neighbors , family members and colleagues , intertwined touching stories with humorous memories .
Marc Evans , president of the Motion Picture Group at Paramount Pictures , recalled his first meeting with Rick Madrid and remembered having an immediate and desperate urge to become friends with him .
“ The word paramount means supreme , ” said Evans , who spoke of Madrid 's love for the studio and its rich heritage . “ To me , Rick will always be paramount . ”
Rickey Kelley a Harley-Davidson dealer who worked with Madrid in staging many celebrity motorcycle rides for charity , spoke of Madrid 's leadership at those events that , over the years , raised more than $ 6 million for various organizations .
Former Burbank Police Lt. Darin Ryburn , who presented Madrid 's widow with a flag that had flown over Burbank police headquarters , recalled his friend 's work backstage and on the red carpet when they handled security for the Country Music Awards .
“ Rick knew everyone — musicians , singers , their business representatives — and he could always be counted on to take care of whatever had to be done , ” Ryburn said .
Before introducing Madrid 's children , Hoefel said that while Madrid had always been a big name-dropper , the names he dropped most often , and with great pride , were those of Drue and Kenny .
Kenny Madrid reminisced about the love his father always showed him .
“ The only problem in my relationship with my dad was that it was too short , ” he said .
Standing between a portrait of her father and a picture of the Madrids together at a recent family gathering , Drue Madrid echoed her brother 's sentiments and said it was fitting that the service took place in the Paramount Theatre because her father loved the venue so much .
“ He loved this room and would have really loved it today because of who it is filled with , ” she said before telling touching tales of her childhood , such as going to her first concert with her dad and being walked down the aisle by him at her wedding .
“ Dec . 3 was the worst day of my life , ” she said . “ But because of my dad , I had 33 years of the best days anyone could ever hope for . ”
For those who knew Rick Madrid , and may like to do something in his memory , the family has requested contributions be made in his name to the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund or the Henry Mayo Newhall Hospital Foundation .
AFTER a successful tour to South Africa with the county 's academy side , Jason Martin is targeting regular Sussex 2nd XI cricket next summer .
The 21-year-old Guernsey wicket-keeper was part of a 15-man Sussex Academy squad which made the three-week trip to Cape Town to play a number of 50-over and three-day matches .
While it took him some time to get going after missing the opening two of those , Martin responded with a succession of tidy performances , both with the bat and behind the stumps .
Batting primarily at No . 5 , he got in regularly despite the tough bowler-friendly conditions , but could not convert any of his innings beyond the best score of 38 .
It meant he finished with a tour average of exactly 23 from his eight innings .
He was also behind the stumps in six of the seven matches he played and , across 300-plus overs , he did not concede a single bye or drop a catch .
Reflecting on his time in South Africa , Martin was pleased with what he learned and also with the way he performed .

A year ago , May proposed that Trump make a state visit to Britain , but there was speculation it would be cancelled due to strong public and political opposition to the president in the UK .
A senior British government source was unable to say whether Trump would receive the prestigious welcome initially offered , or whether his trip would be scaled down to a working visit .
Johnson said : `` What the British people should look for is actually what he 's accomplished and where he wants to go . ''
He admitted that Trump 's relationship with the media had been `` terrible in one way but he is getting the message out in his own unique way '' .
Johnson said he thought Trump would `` absolutely '' be a two-term president .
`` If the president decides to run , he 'll win ... I think he 'll decide to run , '' he said .
New Delhi : Olympic silver-medallist PV Sindhu is satisfied with what she has achieved so far this year but wants to cap a successful season with yet another title at the $ 1000,000 Dubai World Super Series Final starting on Wednesday .
After the high of Rio Olympics last year , Sindhu continued her rampaging run this season clinching the India Open Super Series and Korea Open Super Series , besides bagging the silver at Glasgow World Championship and finishing as runners-up at Hong Kong Open last month .
`` It has been a good year for me and I 'm very happy with my performance . I won two Super Series and a runner-up and also a silver at World Championship . I have no regrets because I did pretty well this season . Now I really hope the year ends on a good note , that is at the Dubai Super Series Finals , I hope I do well there , '' Sindhu told PTI .
`` It is not going to be easy as all the top players will be playing in this event . Each match from the first round itself will be very tough . So I will have to be prepared from the start to do well in Dubai , '' added the Hyderabadi , who had reached the semifinals at Dubai event last year .
Asked which matches impacted her most this season , Sindhu said : `` Each match was comparatively different and in the starting it was Sindhu-Marin and then it was Sindhu-Okuhara at the World Championship and also there were other good matches .
`` I think each player has a different style of play and every match is different . Well , not one in particular but I think the World Championship final impacted me the most . ''
The 22-year-old Indian has played all the 12 Super Series tournaments this season and she credited her training sessions which helped her to manage the workload .
`` Training was going well and I had to be prepared for every match . Every month we had tournaments and I am happy the way I have managed the workload . It worked out fine for me , '' said Sindhu , who played five back-to-back tournaments in October-November .
Badminton World Federation ( BWF ) has revamped the international circuit and made it mandatory for the top 15 players to play at least 12 tournaments next year .
Asked about the schedule next year , Sindhu said : `` I think it would be a hectic schedule next year and we have to plan it out accordingly and play tournaments because each event will be important and also we have other important tournaments such as Commonwealth Games and Asian Games .
`` It 's just that we have to be prepared . I will have to sit with my coach and plan accordingly . The scheduling will depend on the training sessions , how fit I am and how I am playing and also it 's my coach 's decision , so I will sort it out with him which tournaments to play , '' she added .
Sindhu , who finished runners-up at the Senior National Championship in Nagpur , said it would be difficult to figure out a window for the domestic tournament next year .
`` It depends on the schedule as 2018 would be very hectic . It would be difficult to figure out which month or which date it would be . It would not be easy for me or other players . It depends on the scheduling of the tournaments which I play and I will decide accordingly , '' she said .
BWF has decided to trial a new kind of service rule next year starting at the 2018 All England Open Championships and Sindhu said they would have to practice it during training before playing at the tournaments .
`` I heard about the new service rule . I think we all have to be really conscious about it , it would be implemented from the England and we have to really practice it before we play in the tournaments but I think it would be good for everybody , '' said Sindhu .
TOKYO : Shares in Toshiba Corp tumbled on Wednesday after the conglomerate said it would book a US $ 6.3 billion hit to its U.S. nuclear unit and may sell more of its prized flash-memory chip business than planned to urgently raise funds .
Scrambling for capital , Toshiba said it would consider selling most , even all , of its stake in the chips business - a decision that has investors questioning whether the company has a long-term future without the unit .
`` Usually in a corporate turnaround plan , the company would keep its most competitive business after selling non-performing businesses , '' said Masayuki Kubota , chief strategist at Rakuten Securities .
`` This turnaround plan gives no hope for Toshiba 's future , '' he said .
Toshiba will be meeting creditor banks on Wednesday to seek their understanding and support .
As of end of September , Toshiba 's loans from banks and insurers stood at about 800 billion yen ( US $ 7 billion ) , a financial source has told Reuters . Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp and Mizuho Bank are its biggest creditors .
While the two lenders and state-backed Development Bank of Japan Inc have so far expressed support for Toshiba , other creditors will need more convincing before they back Toshiba further , sources familiar with the matter have said .
`` Toshiba needs to come up with a convincing turnaround plan but it 's not an easy task , '' said an executive at one of the creditor banks . `` And we need to make sure there are no more negative surprises , '' he said .
Toshiba shares slid 11.4 percent in morning trade , compared with a 1 percent gain for the broader market .

LONDON : Global stock markets clawed back losses on Monday ( Aug 14 ) as spiralling tensions over North Korea showed tentative signs of easing , in turn reducing appetite for safer assets .
Fears of a catastrophic confrontation between Washington and Pyongyang were calmed when CIA director Mike Pompeo said Sunday that there was `` nothing imminent '' in the escalating stand-off .
London 's benchmark FTSE 100 index climbed 0.6 per cent , while in the eurozone Paris and Frankfurt added more than one per cent .
`` European equity markets appear to have left the fears of late last week behind , with investors coming out of their defensive positions to move back into riskier assets , '' said Joshua Mahony , an analyst at IG Markets .
Approaching midday in New York , the Dow index was up 0.7 per cent , edging back above the key 22,000 level .
Earlier in Asia , Hong Kong was back in positive territory on Monday after slumping two percent Friday , while Shanghai ended the day higher despite data showing that Chinese industrial production slowed sharply in July as government efforts to rein in debt weighed on demand .

However , Tokyo closed down one percent as traders returned from a three-day holiday weekend to play catch-up after Asian and European shares had dropped on Friday , with the Nikkei finishing at its lowest level in more than three months .
Investors largely shrugged off official data showing that Japan 's economy grew by a faster-than-expected one per cent in the three months to June , as the world 's third-largest economy marked its longest expansion in more than a decade .
'NOT OUT OF THE WOODS '
`` What we are seeing today is relief at the ( geopolitical ) situation not deteriorating over the weekend , something traders were clearly wary of towards the end of last week , '' said Oanda analyst Craig Erlam .

As stock markets started recovering , the dollar rose against the Japanese currency and the euro , while gold halted its advance after jumping 2.4 per cent last week .
`` We 're seeing a small unwinding of ... risk aversion trades , with gold trading slightly lower and the yen and Swiss franc off against the dollar , pound and euro , '' Erlam added .
Last week 's losses worldwide were triggered by President Donald Trump 's threat to unleash `` fire and fury '' on North Korea , and Pyongyang countered by announcing plans to test-launch missiles toward Guam .
`` There is a still a 'buy the dips ' mentality running through financial markets , '' said Chris Weston , chief market strategist at IG Markets .
But analysts cautioned that with joint South Korean-US military exercises scheduled and North Korea celebrating `` Liberation Day '' on Tuesday , market volatility could return .
`` We are not out of the woods yet and the situation in North Korea will remain front and centre , '' Weston said .

Wilkes-Barre Area School District Superintendent Brian Costello is planning three community meetings with building tours at each district high school .
The meetings will be Aug. 28 at GAR High School , Aug. 29 at Meyers High School and Aug. 30 at Coughlin High School . Each will start at 6 p.m. and last about an hour , Costello said at the last school board meeting on Aug. 7 .
The meetings will be informal , Costello said , adding he and other administrators will be there to answer questions from the public .
Information about the community meetings will be posted on the district website .
District residents have expressed an interest in touring the aging high schools to get a better look at some of the problems and challenges with the buildings .
The district plans to close Meyers and Coughlin and merge the two high schools by building a new consolidated high school on the 80-acre Pagnotti Enterprises site between Maffett and Main streets in Plains Twp . The estimated cost to build on that site is between $ 101 million and $ 118 million , and construction could take five years .
In January 2016 , the school district abandoned Coughlin 's main building in downtown Wilkes-Barre because of exterior deterioration , moved the 11th and 12th grades into the Coughlin annex on North Washington Street , and moved Coughlin 's ninth and 10th grades into the renovated Mackin school in the city 's East End .
Meyers is in South Wilkes-Barre , and district officials want to keep the school open until the new high school is finished . GAR is in the Heights neighborhood in the city .
The district is funding a $ 600,000 project at GAR to replace some masonry and determine what is causing deterioration there .

At the end of November , the US Olympic Committee looked back on the year by hosting the 2017 Team USA Awards at UCLA 's Royce Hall .
From the aquatics world , Katie Ledecky and Caeleb Dressel were nominated for Female and Male Olympic Athlete of the Year , and the US Women 's Water Polo Team was nominated for Olympic Team of the Year . Though neither swimmer was in attendance , Ledecky took the win .
Besides the awards themselves , the hot topic of the night was the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics , as a number of attendees were heavily involved in the city 's bid . SwimSwam spoke with Janet Evans about the host bit process , as well as her relationship with Ledecky . LA 2028 Chair Casey Wasserman discussed what it was like to work with Evans .
Also in attendance was five-time Olympic Medalist and former World Record-holder John Naber , who clearly is loving all of the excitement around swimming today .
We also spoke with water polo player John Mann . After competing for Team USA at the 2012 and 2016 Olympics , Mann is in a transitional moment of his career as he begins to pursue a professional life outside of the sport , while still considering his prospects within it .
President Trump 's reflection is seen in First Lady Melania Trump 's sunglasses . ( Pablo Martinez Monsivais / Associated Press )
She is either complicit in her husband 's worst instincts or a victim of them , either struggling in an anachronistic job or confidently doing precisely what she wants to do with it . Fifteen months after she became first lady , Melania Trump remains a mystery .
In the span of several days ending Tuesday , Melania Trump will have been thrust into a more visible public role than perhaps at any other time in her husband 's presidency . It comes after a lengthy period of relative invisibility that has not only confounded White House tradition but also limited her potential political benefit to a troubled administration .
After hosting the Japanese prime minister and his wife at Trump 's Mar-a-Lago compound in Florida last week , Melania Trump attended the Saturday funeral of former First Lady Barbara Bush in Houston ; the president stayed away . Before the service she smiled and chatted with President Obama , whom her husband has scorned for years , and , again smiling , joined in a formal picture with all of the former presidents and first ladies who attended the funeral .
Renault announced plans on Wednesday to launch in September a ride-hailing and car-sharing scheme covering the French capital and its surrounding areas .
PARIS : Renault announced plans on Wednesday to launch in September a ride-hailing and car-sharing scheme covering the French capital and its surrounding areas .
Renault and Peugeot-maker PSA are vying to offer a car sharing scheme in Paris to replace Autolib , the electric car sharing service run by French tycoon Vincent Bollore 's group that was recently ditched by local authorities after a dispute .

Renault already offers a car sharing service in France called `` Renault Mobility '' and operates 500 Zoe electric cars in `` free floating '' in Madrid . Renault said it hoped to have eventually more than 2,000 vehicles available for the Paris car-sharing and ride-hailing service .
Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo also told a news conference on Wednesday that other companies had expressed an interest in plans to get involved in a car-sharing project for the city .
PSA will launch during the last quarter of 2018 a `` free floating '' car-sharing scheme in Paris , allowing drivers to pick up an electric vehicle at one location and leave it elsewhere in the city , PSA said earlier this week .
Launched in 2011 , Autolib has 150,000 active users and its silver-coloured small cars have become a familiar sight on Paris streets .

Padmaavat : Amid Rajput romance and valour , Bhansali gives us a most queer love story
The film once known as Padmavati ( now Padmaavat ) has exposed the strangest fault-lines in India . The progressive liberals , the freedom of expression-wallas , are fighting for a film that is supposed to glorify jauhar where mass suicide is better than dishonour . Meanwhile the Rajputs whose bravery has been made the stuff of legend in the film are protesting it in droves . And now the Karni Sena has withdrawn its protest , admitted it 's a valentine to Rajput valour and promised to help the film release everywhere .
But amidst these vitriolic debates about progressive vs regressive , distracted by this dizzying farce , we miss the one thing truly subversive about Padmaavat .
Malik Kafur .
War booty . Eunuch . Slave . Confidante . General . Malik Kafur is the underhand queer storyline of an overblown heterosexual love story .
The film is so over-the-top , it veers into camp . While CGI ensures Deepika Padukone remains discreetly covered from head to toe , even while dancing to 'Ghoomar ' , the men are all heaving bare chests , always happy to soak in a bathtub or take a break from battle to wrestle glossily . No bosom heaves as much in the film as the pectorals of Ranvir Singh and Shahid Kapoor as they go mano-a-mano , seemingly drawn to each other by some inexorable force of animal magnetism . They even go to great lengths to be alone together , their faces inches away from each other . Alone in the desert night , smouldering at each other , a bit of bondage and fetish — this is the stuff of gay fantasies .
If that is fantasy , Malik Kafur as played by Jim Sarbh is very much real . Some might think this is yet another example of Bollywood homophobia . Here we have the heartless , cunning eunuch deviously plotting the downfall of true love .
But that 's missing the point . Malik Kafur is the only character with real agency and brains in the film . He rises from a shrouded slave to become Alauddin 's confidante and right hand man . His character has real trajectory . Ranvir Singh 's Alauddin Khilji is unadulterated testosterone . Shahid Kapoor 's Ratan Singh is distilled righteousness , asli desi ghee , so pure and wholesome it almost gives indigestion . And once Deepika Padukone stops hunting in the forests of Sinhala and becomes a princess , she is instantly weighed down by all that parampara and jewellery , Manyavar-Mohey meets Tanishq . All she can do is act noble .
Only Kafur is free to chart his destiny . And he does so with relish .
Unlike Padmini/Padmavati whose historicity is disputed , Kafur definitely existed . He was called hazar-dinari because — the story went — he was purchased for 1,000 dinars . He was presented as a slave to Alauddin and was favoured by him as commander and chamberlain . He led raids into the Deccan , repulsed the Mongols and became the governor of Devagiri . In Alauddin 's paranoid last days he grew even closer , masterminding a great purge . When Khilji died , Kafur installed himself as regent but was soon assassinated .
Was this a great love affair ? Ruth Vanita and Salim Kidwai have maintained it was based on the descriptions from court chronicler Ziauddin Baran who said the sultan was losing his senses and falling madly in love with the “ useless , ungrateful , ingratiate sodomite ” . Others insist the relationship was not sexual but do not deny the closeness between the two , a closeness described as an inexplicable infatuation .
Whatever the reality was , what 's delicious is Sanjay Leela Bhansali has snuck in a gay love story of sorts in a film that is red-blooded paean to heterosexual love . Kafur gets to sing to Alauddin Khilji . He scrubs the sultan 's feet in the bathtub , causing Alauddin to arch his back in pleasure , strokes his back with peacock feathers , kills for him and then ushers his mistress into the bedchamber and draws the curtains on them . But the mistresses come and go . Kafur is the one with unfettered access to the bedchamber . When the Rajputs rain fire on the camp , it 's Kafur who jumps onto the bed to rouse the sleeping Alauddin . It is fascinating because in a story of love and lust among the blue-blooded , this is the slave — sex-slave if you will — who wields such power . We see little of what he gets from Alauddin though at one point the sultan lovingly pats his cheek , a rare gesture of tenderness in a character filled with rutting violence .
But Kafur knows his limits . Like classic old-fashioned gay love stories , he knows he will never get the ultimate respect . At one point he says almost wistfully that he can come very close to Alauddin Khilji but he can not take the place of Padamvati .
That is the true tragic love story hidden away in all the sturm und drang of the Ratan-Padamvati-Alauddin triangle . Kafur is the queer fourth angle to their triangle . The story goes the real Malik Kafur looted the Koh-i-noor from the Kakatiyas for his sultan . Padmavati is the Koh-i-noor here and Malik Kafur spends the film plotting how to get that for Alauddin Khilji , even though he knows the price he will pay for it .
This too is love , devotion and sacrifice in its own way .
And yet Sanjay Leela Bhansali does not make him either a simpering laughing stock or some woebegone tragic figure . Malik Kafur , sly and conniving , is a go-getter and not unashamed to broadcast his proximity to the sultan . When he arrives at the court of Chittor , a nobleman tells the Rana that he is the sultan 's close companion , “ Uski begum hi samajh li jiye ” ( consider him his wife ) . They snicker . But Kafur has the last laugh .
Ultimately it 's Malik Kafur who emerges the winner when all the ashes settle . Alauddin Khilji 's dream of obtaining Padmavati dies in a blaze of jauhar . Meanwhile he has imprisoned his own wife , the hapless Mehrunisa who helped Padmavati and the Rana .
When you think about it who does Alauddin Khilji have in the end ?
Only Malik Kafur .
As the end credits roll , one can almost imagine Malik Kafur , drawing his sultan another hot bath .
In the guise of a full-throated story about Rajput love and valour , Sanjay Leela Bhansali has given us a most queer love story . For a Bollywood film , that 's something .

“ It is a dream come true but I know at the same time it is just a start , ” Phillips said . “ It is nice just to take a couple days here to reflect on how far I have come playing since I was 5 years old. ” Phillips says he is expecting a call from the Giants in the coming days to finalize his plans for rookie ball .

South African startup SA Florist has launched a programme to onboard township florists , and plans to attract , upskill and support at least 30 entrepreneurs over the next three years .
SA Florist is a custom-built marketplace for consumers and corporate clients to order South flower bouquets , arrangements , and gifts .
A four-month pilot of its new programme has been launched in Soweto to empower independent florists that are owned by black women and service the township area . From 16 applications , five were selected to participate in the programme .
SA Florist managing director Matt Surkont said the pilot project was the result of a detailed analysis of the existing 300 florists on the platform .
“ We found an unacceptably small percentage were black-owned , ” he said .
The programme uses a two-pronged approach , combining training and peer-to-peer mentorship . The aim is to play a pivotal role in using technology to transform townships by creating market access .
“ SA Florist has proved the case by brining township florists into the economy and onto our technology marketplace through this pilot programme . We intend to expand this programme and transform the industry as a whole , ” Surkont said .
The entrepreneurs attended five half-day training sessions at Khonology 's Academy focusing on the SA Florist technology , financial management , lean business canvas model and flower arrangement . They were paired with an established florist mentor already on the SA Florist technology platform and spent time learning how to optimise their business operations .
Khonology marketing manager Africa Nkosi said the academy empowers entrepreneurs by providing fundamental knowledge of the core financial products and core technologies .
“ The academy aims to provide a practical understanding of the day-to-day workings of specific markets , explain the application of the products within those markets and to explain the under-pinning technology to ensure the markets remain efficient , ” he said .
Gertrude Mentoor , who is the owner of Mande Bloom florist in Soweto , said the initiative is a great platform for florists to display their talent .
“ Receiving guidance through such a wonderful programme increases business opportunities and gives us the necessary exposure to become an established florist , ” she said .

LONDON , Feb 2 ( Reuters ) - Britain 's top share index retreated on Friday after results from BT and AstraZeneca were met with disappointment , rounding off a lacklustre week for British blue chips .
The blue chip FTSE 100 index was down 0.2 percent at 7,476.12 points by 0942 GMT , set for its fourth day of straight losses , while mid caps declined 0.3 percent .
“ There 's a global flight to safety out of risk assets , so it 's not just a UK phenomenon , ” Jasper Lawler , head of research at London Capital Group , said .
“ We have had some soft earnings with some quite dramatic falls for individual shares ( which ) have dented a bit of appetite for UK stocks , then we have had the pound which has been generally pretty resilient , pretty strong , ” Lawler added .
Share price falls following earnings updates were to blame for declines on the day , with the FTSE 100 on track for its worst week in nearly six months as it retreated further from the record high it hit in the middle of January .
BT Group was the biggest faller , its shares down more than 5 percent at a five-year low after the telecoms firm reported third quarter earnings .
While BT broadly met expectations , analysts flagged a lack of growth and concerns around its pension scheme .
“ The performance in the Wholesale and Global Services divisions remains stagnant , whilst the pension situation is a concern . Key metrics such as revenues and earnings per share remain patchy and slightly light of expectations , ” Richard Hunter , head of markets at interactive investor , said .
AstraZeneca also saw its shares decline after giving an update on its performance for the full-year .
The pharma company dropped 1.7 percent on the back of a disappointing profit outlook .
Elsewhere a bounce among commodities-related stocks was a bright spot . Shares in miners Anglo American , Antofagasta and Rio Tinto rose between 0.3 percent to 0.9 percent thanks to a firmer copper price .
Heavyweight oil stocks Royal Dutch Shell and BP also advanced 0.7 percent and 0.4 percent respectively as oil prices extended gains .
Among smaller stocks , troubled outsourcer Capita was the top gainer on the mid cap index , its shares rising more than 5 percent following an upgrade from broker Morgan Stanley to “ equal-weight ” from “ underweight ” .
Capita 's shares have tumbled this week following a big profit warning and dividend suspension .
“ We continue to view Capita as a traditional BPO provider that is competitively challenged , which justifies a discount to its wider peers , ” Morgan Stanley analysts said in a note , referring to business process outsourcing .
“ But with the shares now up with events , we move to Equal-weight . ”

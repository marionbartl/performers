One of the biggest problems with Star Wars movies that many fans and detractors like to point out is how incompetent the Stormtroopers are , especially their marksman abilities . A hallmark of every movie shows the Stormtroopers firing wildly , missing even the slowest moving targets and placing shots nowhere near their intended aim . Their abilities are highlighted in A New Hope from some Obi-Wan dialogue , but we never really get to see their `` precise '' handiwork . That has all changed now that one competent Stormtrooper has been identified .
As it turns out , the underappreciated Stormtrooper , identified as TK-714 , was seen in Return of the Jedi , right under our noses the entire time . During the main battle on Endor , we see a ton of bad shots by the Empire , basically only connecting with the shield generator . Then comes the moment that we 've all seemed to forget : when TK-714 takes aim , shoots , and connects with Princess Leia 's arm . It 's mind boggling that it 's taken this long to find the one Stormtrooper with any aim whatsoever , but he 's finally being recognized for his work , 34 years later .
Some believe that the Stormtroopers are just mimicking real-life soldiers who are battling in war . A study conducted years ago finds that not many soldiers fire their weapons at all and when they do , they do n't want to take another life . So , they wildly shoot in an effort not to hit anything , which could explain why the Stormtroopers have the worst aim in the history of movies . Or , it could just be some lazy Star Wars storytelling . If they were as precise as Obi-Wan claimed , nobody would have made it out of A New Hope alive .
In Star Wars movies , there was another Stormtrooper who was a decent shot . FN-2187 in The Force Awakens turned out to be pretty good with a blaster , but he was n't a part of the Empire and he later joined the Resistance , where his blasting aim really started to flourish . Finn might be an outlier , but he was once a Stormtrooper , so that has to count for something , right ? Maybe this is something that J.J. Abrams will address in the upcoming Star Wars 9 or maybe even in Rian Johnson 's new trilogy that he 's currently cooking up .
While 99 percent of Stormtroopers have terrible aim , it 's important to let TK-714 shine bright like the hero that he/she is . Out of 9 movies , he was the one to make a difference and it took 34 years to get recognized . The next time that a Star Wars fan or even hater talks about the horrible aim of the Stormtroopers , we can now safely defend ourselves because one member of the Empire was able to successfully hit Princess Leia in the arm during the main battle sequence on Endor .

The shortened daylight hours and the rapid approach of the holidays always mark the end of a fall semester , but for TV viewers it also indicates winter finale season . Since most shows go on a winter hiatus and viewers have to wait several weeks before their favorite TV characters return to the screen in the new year , TV writers often go to great lengths to ensure that the last episode before the break is surprising and exciting , and it often ends with an unforgettable , mind-blowing cliffhanger . Accordingly , fans of The CW 's ‚Äú Supernatural ‚Äù ( 2005‚Äì ) felt anything but let down after watching that midseason finale earlier this week . Unfortunately , for dedicated viewers of another CW show , ‚Äú Crazy Ex-Girlfriend ‚Äù ( 2015‚Äì ) , the same can not be said .
At its core , ‚Äú Crazy Ex-Girlfriend ‚Äù is a musical comedy . If the musical element suffers , so does the comedy ; therefore , the success of the show is based entirely on the music . In the early days of ‚Äú Crazy Ex-Girlfriend , ‚Äù before it became a cult phenomenon , there might have been three , sometimes even four songs in an episode , all of them hilariously relevant and relatable . Recently , however , viewers are lucky to get two songs , each deserving of at most a polite chuckle . The songs in last week 's midseason finale seemed rushed and forced , and as if viewers needed to feel even more cheated , both were solos . ( The show 's ensemble songs tend to be of much higher quality . ) And just like the songs themselves , the plot supporting them could not have been weaker .
Rebecca ( Rachel Bloom ) has been the sole focus of the show for several episodes , so it is understandable that her close friend Paula ( Donna Lynne Champlin ) is finally in the spotlight . Nevertheless , her storyline is essentially a contrived version of the show as a whole . Upon spotting her longtime ex-boyfriend , Jeff Chanington , at the supermarket , Paula sings ‚Äú First Penis I Saw. ‚Äù When asked by an employee why she is staring at Jeff so intensely , Paula answers , ‚Äú He 's my Josh Chan , ‚Äù as if his name alone did n't already make that obvious enough . Moreover , unlike with Josh and Rebecca , who actually have a romantic backstory , Paula 's song seems to imply that the only reason she still cares about Jeff at all is that she was impressed by his penis , which adds an element of misogyny the show has never before expressed . Worse , Jeff proves to be completely irrelevant ; after he tells Paula that she is important and meaningful as her own person and not just as a best friend or coworker , Paula simply thanks him and leaves , transforming what could have been a new , interesting romantic development into the ultimate anticlimax . Thus , rather than demonstrating how the character of Paula can truly exist in its own space , the writers instead expose how flawed a character Paula actually is .
After nearly killing herself and being diagnosed with borderline personality disorder , Rebecca appears to be doing well in the recovery process . She strictly follows the treatment plan her doctor outlined for her ( although in true Rebecca fashion , she goes above and beyond , hoping the doctor will give her an A+ ) , and is overall much happier with herself than perhaps ever before . However , it is clear that in some ways she has made no improvement whatsoever . She tries to refrain from maintaining a sexual relationship with Nathaniel ( Scott Michael Foster ) because her doctor advises against it , but eventually begins sexting him before giving in completely and ‚Äú visiting ‚Äù him . In this way , she has not moved on from Josh ( Vincent Rodriguez III ) , but rather has replaced him with another man she can not help but become emotionally attached to . Yet at the end of the episode , when she tells the doctor about her sexual encounter ( as well as other actions she took throughout the episode that more likely harm her than help ) , she adds that she has finally realized that being human is not as black and white as she originally believed , to which the doctor responds by giving her the coveted A+ . Dude , did you not hear all the other things she just told you ? With a doctor like that , it will not be a surprise if Rebecca never gets better .
Other fun parts of the episode include Josh missing out on a date due to a staph infection , the continuation of the never-ending argument between White Josh ( David Hull ) and Darryl ( Pete Gardner ) about whether to have a baby and a notable lack of Valencia ( Gabrielle Ruiz ) . If the show keeps moving in this direction , it will soon be the crazy ex-CW show that never should have made it to a third season in the first place .
Australian Peter Brown has lived in various parts of Singapore for more than two decades . Here he talks about how he ended up in a provision shop in Chai Chee .
SINGAPORE : Deep in the heart of Chai Chee , Runda Minimart is everything you would expect of a heartland provision shop .
The storefront at Block 21 Chai Chee Road is packed with shelves of bread , eggs and children 's toys . Then there 's the customary row of colourful gashapon machines .
But walk inside and there is an unexpected sight : A silver-haired Caucasian manning the cash register . Australian Peter Brown , 62 , has worked as a cashier in the shop since it first opened three years ago .
‚Äú Several people come in and go : ‚Äò Ang moh in a shop ? In Singapore ? It 's not possible ! ' ‚Äù he told Channel NewsAsia after completing a shift . ‚Äú Then they ask if it 's my business . They think all ang mohs are bosses , not workers . ‚Äù
The permanent resident , who has lived in Singapore for 24 years , is not your typical expatriate . He earns S $ 1,000 a month working four-hour shifts , seven days a week . Home is a rented room in an HDB flat a short walk away .
Peter has been around for so long that he has become a familiar face in the neighbourhood . Even the fruit seller waves and shouts ‚Äú ang moh ‚Äù each time he walks by .

Some customers do not register Peter 's race , and automatically speak to him in Mandarin . He has picked up the language over time , although he is still far from fluent .
So , when he replies to customers , they often look up in shock before asking where he is from . ‚Äú From China , ‚Äù he usually says . ‚Äú I play games with them . ‚Äù
But Peter 's job is far from being just a game .
On top of his cashiering duties , he takes stock of sometimes challenging deliveries . ‚Äú There are hundreds of different items and I 've got to get them on the shelves or stored away because they block the aisles , ‚Äù he said .
Peter also ensures the racks and fridges are constantly full . This means moving around a lot and topping up the best-selling Carlsberg cans as soon as they fly off the shelves .

‚Äú Some days are dull , some days are very busy , ‚Äù he said . ‚Äú It 's not my idea of a career . I 'm doing it because I ca n't find anything else . ‚Äù
THE ARTIST
It 's Friday morning at the shop and business has been slow all week . Then , a man pulls up with a trolley loaded with boxes of chips and cookies . Suddenly it 's not so slow .
Peter leaves his post and pulls the inventory list close to his nose ‚Äì something does n't seem right . A line starts forming at the cashier and a boy impatiently rings the bell on the counter .
This is Peter 's world .

To understand how this elderly man ended up working in a cramped shop almost 5,000km away from home , you have to go back more than two decades to when he landed his first job in Singapore at an American firm based in Bukit Timah .
Peter , a stained glass artist , had just come off a failed business venture in Australia . He was also hit with a fine after his previous employer ran into some legal problems .
‚Äú I needed to find some money urgently , ‚Äù he said . ‚Äú This company was offering me a good wage and immediate work , and I jumped at the opportunity . ‚Äù
In 1993 , the then 38-year-old left for Singapore to embark on a six-month contract painting windows for Hard Rock Cafes in the region .
The company had to look as far as Australia because glass painters were a ‚Äú rare breed ‚Äù . Furthermore , Peter said , it felt American artists would struggle with the culture shock of living and working in a place like Singapore .
It did n't take long for Peter to experience the shock for himself .
‚Äú Here in Singapore , clients would spend six months debating how much to pay , and as soon as they agree to the cost , they want the thing tomorrow , ‚Äù he said . ‚Äú My boss was constantly on my back , asking me to work faster and more efficiently . ‚Äù
Outside of the ‚Äú punishing schedules ‚Äù at the office , Peter grappled with the unfamiliar cuisine . He described mee rebus as ingredients ‚Äú floating around in this dark gravy ‚Äù , while the smell of shrimp sauce in rojak ‚Äú made me want to vomit ‚Äù .
The weather was also too hot , and he did not understand a word of the local slang . ‚Äú I remember going into the lift at work , ‚Äù he said . ‚Äú These girls were talking and I asked my colleague what language they were speaking . English ? You 're kidding ! ‚Äù
Over the years , Peter got used to things . He learnt to love rojak and eventually spoke perfect Singlish . As for his job , the American company ‚Äú kept getting work and they kept needing me ‚Äù . The six-month contract became 12 , then 18 .
It was n't all good news , though .
The company started losing money and eventually fired him in 1995 after an argument . ‚Äú I was in a low state of mind because I had lost my job , and I did n't know whether I would stay here or go back to Australia , ‚Äù he said .
THE CHURCH-GOER
Back at the shop , Peter usually takes the morning shift , which runs from 8am until noon . He raises the shutters , pushes out the roller shelves and counts the cigarette cartons in the cabinet behind the counter . This is a daily routine .
Cigarettes are one of the shop 's most popular items , Peter said , before attending to a customer . He plucked out a pack of Winston Reds and pushed it across the counter .
Peter 's final assignment at the American company was to paint some windows for Bethesda Cathedral , a large church in Chai Chee . He completed the painting , but got sacked before it went up .

Just before Christmas that year , Peter turned up at the church with his camera as he always made it a habit to photograph his work for his portfolio .
‚Äú They were having a Christmas barbeque , ‚Äù he said . ‚Äú They were curious and did n't know who I was , and they invited me to a church service . ‚Äù
Peter identified as Christian at that time , but he was n't particularly pious . Even so , he found himself warming to the church 's messages .
He started attending church every week and eventually taught children at the Sunday school there . He also began teaching kids art and craft on Saturday evenings .

Peter also found a job at a local stained glass company , where he designed pieces for churches , hotels and condominiums . His proudest work ? For a private home in Kuala Lumpur , he painted Da Vinci 's The Last Supper on a 3m by 2m window .
Peter admitted that he has grown comfortable in Singapore . ‚Äú It was just a job , ‚Äù he said of his first stint with the American company . ‚Äú My plan was to come here , earn money and go home . ‚Äù
More than a year after he left the glass company in 2012 , a couple of church members opened the provision shop in Chai Chee and hired him as its cashier .
‚Äú I never dreamt that I would stay in Singapore for so long , ‚Äù he said .
THE NOMAD
During his years here , Peter has lived in more than 10 homes , in locations ranging from Queenstown to Bedok North . He has had to move around a lot because rental fees are ‚Äú crazy ‚Äù . ‚Äú Everybody is selling their units , ‚Äù he said .
He hates the constant shifting , but it has meant he has been able to explore different parts of Singapore . Because he loves the beach , he is particularly fond of Sentosa . And after moving to the east , he would regularly cycle along East Coast Park , which he called ‚Äú one of Singapore 's great little places ‚Äù .
Despite that , Peter said he 's not a very social person . Besides attending gatherings with church members on Friday evenings , he keeps very much to himself .

Still , he makes it a point to see his two brothers and a sister in Australia once a year . He goes to Bathurst , a small town three hours away by car from Sydney , where he grew up on a ‚Äú beautiful ‚Äù farm with his parents . His father died last July , his mother four years ago .
He also misses Australia 's seasons , vast spaces and Western food , which he stressed is more than ‚Äú french fries , coleslaw and baked beans ‚Äù .
Does he feel lonely in Singapore ? ‚Äú All the time , but you get used to it , ‚Äù he replied . ‚Äú Being alone is part of life . You do n't really make friends , but you chit-chat with customers . ‚Äù
Peter said he 's been through a number of relationships here , but ‚Äú nothing 's happened ‚Äù . ‚Äú I thought that I would like to get married . I thought I 'd be a successful artist anywhere I go , ‚Äù he said . ‚Äú That 's a bit of a frustration for me . ‚Äù
At his age , Peter acknowledged that the ‚Äú book is closing fast , but I do n't know where it leads ‚Äù .
‚Äú I 've seen so many people here in Singapore in their 70s who are struggling to walk and do n't work , ‚Äù he added . ‚Äú In 10 years ' time , am I going to be sick ? ‚Äù
Peter keeps fit by visiting a gym in Chai Chee twice a week . He used to play tennis too , but his age has put the brakes on that . ‚Äú Thankfully , my father and mother lived to 95 and 93 , so maybe there 's good genes in the family , ‚Äù he said with a laugh .
He 's also earning some extra cash by giving English tuition and working part-time with the same local glass company . This is so he can cover his S $ 600 a month rent and expenses like his phone bill and annual trip home .
Peter does n't want to retire because he ca n't afford it . But things might change . With the inheritance from his late parents , he could buy his own house , be it in Singapore or Australia . It 's something he 's never had in his life .
Nevertheless , Peter described himself as the ‚Äú biggest procrastinator in the world ‚Äù . ‚Äú When I get older , I wo n't be able to work hard and my income goes down , so where do I spend my old age ? ‚Äù he said . ‚Äú I avoid making decisions at all costs . ‚Äù

He always found himself sticking around in Singapore because ‚Äú there 's always work here to do ‚Äù . He has great affection for the church too . ‚Äú For some strange reason , it 's a good church . ‚Äù
For Peter , life had not turned out how he thought it would , but he learnt not to ‚Äú worry about what you think you 're lacking ‚Äù .
‚Äú Life has its way of leading you to places , and it 's not your plan , ‚Äù he said .
About 1,000 migrants have tried to force their way into the Spanish enclave of Ceuta bordering Morocco by storming a wired border fence . Local officials say dozens of security forces from both Spain and Morocco have been injured .
Crowds of migrants approached the 6-meter-high barbed wire border fence early Sunday and tried to break into Ceuta in several places . The local officials called the attempt ‚Äú well organized and violent , ‚Äù local news outlets write .
Migrants tried ‚Äú to force open some of the doors in the external fence , using iron bars , wire cutters and large stones , ‚Äù a statement by Ceuta government said , as cited by the local media . The refugees then assaulted Moroccan security forces as well as Spanish police ( Guardia Civil ) .

Ongoing American military support for PYD/YPG terrorists not only jeopardizes Turkey 's security but also poisons the long-standing bilateral partnership between Washington and Ankara , Turkey 's top diplomat recently told a foreign magazine .
Mevl√ºt √áavu≈üoƒülu 's remarks came last month in an exclusive interview with the Canadian-based , Ottawa Life Magazine , in Canada , where he attended The Vancouver Foreign Ministers ' Meeting on Security and Stability on the Korean Peninsula .
√áavu≈üoƒülu said the U.S. and Turkey are in a delicate period because Ankara and Washington hold different views on important issues , including PYD/YPG terrorists in Syria and the presence of the FET√ñ terror group in the U.S .
`` As a NATO ally , Turkey rightly asks the U.S. to prioritize Turkey 's vital security concerns over the U.S. 's short-term tactical policy goals , '' he said . `` However , Turkey and the U.S. are long-standing allies , and our relations are time-tested . ''
While highlighting the importance of Turkish-American cooperation for bilateral relations and the future of the region , √áavu≈üoƒülu said Ankara continues high-level contacts with Washington and believes it is important to keep communication channels open .
`` We need to focus on a positive agenda from which both sides can benefit . Enhancing economic relations is also a priority for both sides , '' he said , noting his meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson in Vancouver regarding current difficulties in bilateral relation and Turkey 's expectations from the U.S .
`` We would like to increase our bilateral trade volume [ 17.5 billion dollars in 2016 ] and encourage mutual investments . ''
As the carnage and war in Syria appears to be winding down , √áavu≈üoƒülu was reluctant to make any definitive comments about that outlook for 2018 but said that nation 's future would be determined by Syrians .
`` During the last seven years of conflict , which started with peaceful protests and then flamed into a civil war , the people of Syria have made their choice clear , '' he said . `` They aspire for democracy , freedom , equality , and rule of law . The record of [ Bashar ] Assad counters these aspirations . History tells us that the will of the people prevails eventually , '' and he said Turkey would continue its `` intense efforts '' to ensure talks in Astana , Sochi and Geneva yield concrete results so that 2018 would be the final year of conflict .
Along with ensuring lasting and credible political solutions to the conflict , √áavu≈üoƒülu said the goal would not be reached unless the international community helps rebuild Syria 's infrastructure , facilitate the return of refugees and those displaced , and provide economic aid .
`` In brief , the international community should contribute to saving the future generations of Syria , '' he said .
Regarding Iraq and the Kurdish Regional Government 's ( KRG ) referendum in Iraq last year , √áavu≈üoƒülu said Ankara opposed the vote only to ensure Iraq 's territorial integrity and help sustain regional stability .
`` Preserving Iraq 's sovereignty , territorial integrity and political unity is vital for Turkey . These principles are also critical for regional peace and stability , '' he said .
`` In line with this understanding , we opposed the KRG referendum , and the Iraqi Federal Supreme Court 's recent rulings have proven us right . In coordination with the Iraqi Federal Government , we adopted some measures against the KRG . ''
Shortly after the vote , considered illegal by Turkey and other regional and global observers , the court ruled in favor of Iraqi territorial integrity . It also said the Kurds should relinquish control of its areas to the Iraqi government .
√áavu≈üoƒülu was adamant Turkey never targeted the Iraqi Kurds by not supporting the referendum , and said the KRG leadership should unequivocally accept the court 's decision and act accordingly with Iraqi government .
If Baghdad and Erbil , the capital of the KRG , enter negotiations , Turkey would be one of the strongest supporters of the process , said √áavu≈üoƒülu .
Daesh has been militarily defeated in Iraq and it is now time for the Iraqi government to defeat the terror group ideologically by adopting inclusive policies , promoting a common Iraqi identity and reconstructing liberated areas , according to √áavu≈üoƒülu , who noted Turkey will support its neighbor in those efforts .
`` Vis-a-vis the Kurdish situation in Syria , the key defining factor will not be the defeat of Daesh on the ground through military means . A new social and political contract should be reached via a Syrian-led and Syrian-owned process , and it should determine the role of Syrian Kurds in Syria 's future . Our efforts aim at facilitating this process , be it in Astana , Geneva , or Sochi. , '' √áavu≈üoƒülu said .
`` The delegates of Syrian Kurds who chose to isolate themselves from terrorist organizations are well-represented in these fora . As for the PYD/YPG , which is the Syrian extension of the PKK terrorist organization , it is destined to fail in its efforts to create fait accompli on the ground , under the pretext of combating terrorism . We will continue to support the legitimate aspirations of the Syrian people to live freely in a democratic Syria that maintains its territorial integrity and political unity . ''
Turning to Jerusalem recently being acknowledged as Israel 's capital by the U.S. , √áavu≈üoƒülu said the city also known as Quds is home to three monotheistic religions and Its preservation is the duty of all humankind .
`` No one has the right to make unilateral or arbitrary decisions on the status of Jerusalem , which is one of the final status issues in negotiating peace between Palestinians and Israelis , '' he said , adding that President Donald Trump 's decision on Jerusalem is a `` dangerous violation '' of international law and a source of tensions in the region .
Because of Trump 's `` illegal '' decision , Israeli officials are announcing a rash of settlement plans and taking steps to intensify the occupation of Palestinian lands , which imperils the viability of a two-state solution that is based on 1967 borders , according to √áavu≈üoƒülu .
Recalling the UN vote that rejected and slammed the U.S. for the decision , and Washington 's threats to countries for casting votes against the U.S. , √áavu≈üoƒülu urged all nations to stand against efforts to create further fait accompli concerning the status of Jerusalem .
`` The current status quo is not sustainable . A new approach is needed to achieve comprehensive , just and lasting peace in the Middle East , '' he added . `` We are ready to support all efforts to revive the peace process . ''
Touching on Turkey 's membership in and relationship with its NATO partners , the Turkish minister described the alliance as the center of Turkey 's defense and security plans .
`` Turkey has historically shouldered its fair share of the burden , if not more , within NATO , and it continues to do so with equal determination . Our record of 66 years within the alliance , including our current undertakings , speaks for itself , '' he said .
Citing NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg 's praise of Turkey for being `` a valued ally making important contributions to the alliance '' , √áavu≈üoƒülu said Turkey is a valued ally making important contributions to the Alliance .
`` First and foremost , we are a frontline actor in the fight against terrorism , in particular against terrorist groups such as Daesh , as well as the PKK and its offshoots PYD/YPG . As one of the top-five contributors to NATO operations , we have been a consistent and significant contributor to NATO undertakings in Afghanistan , as is the case with the ongoing Resolute Support Mission , '' he continued .
`` Turkey is a proud member of NATO and is particularly fond of its solemn partnership with Canada . Indeed , while there are some circles trying to cast doubt on Turkey 's commitment to NATO , the facts on the ground are clear . We are forthcoming in our commitments , and we greatly value allied solidarity and cooperation , '' he said , reiterating that Ankara expects the same from its NATO allies .
`` Any concern of ours should be a matter of concern for them . This is particularly true in the face of our longstanding fight against terrorism in our part of the world , '' he added .
SINGAPORE : A new smartphone app is being used as part of a clinical trial to help pregnant women with diabetes manage their condition better and prevent excessive weight gain during pregnancy .
Gestational diabetes mellitus is a type of diabetes that develops usually during the second half of pregnancy , when there is insufficient insulin production to meet extra demands for pregnancy , resulting in high blood glucose levels .
Singapore has one of the highest rates of gestational diabetes in the world , with the condition affecting 20 to 30 per cent of expecting mothers . If left untreated or poorly managed , it can lead to various complications for both mother and baby . For the mother , this includes increased risk of high blood pressure , while the baby runs the risk of jaundice , breathing problems , and in the worst scenario , still birth .
The app , developed by the National University Hospital ( NUH ) , is being used as part of a clinical trial for a tailored coaching programme to help more pregnant women better manage their gestational diabetes , compared with standard care alone .
It consists of several components . First , there are short , personalised interactive lessons and daily tips to help mothers understand the importance of managing the condition for themselves and their babies .
There are also tracking features to help women monitor their weight and blood glucose levels , even on the go . This is done via the detachable Aina blood glucose monitoring device , where a blood test strip is analysed to determine the user 's blood sugar .

The app can be paired with a Bluetooth weighing scale to help chart weight gain .
It also helps track food intake , which may cause spikes in blood glucose levels , said Dr Yew Tong Wei , who is site principal investigator of the SMART-GDM ( gestational diabetes mellitus ) clinical trial and consultant at NUH 's division of endocrinology .
The app also features an automated chatbot that prompts users to take further action when their blood sugar readings are high .
The app and the study aims to target behavioural change , which doctors say is the key to managing gestational diabetes and helping mothers achieve optimal health outcomes .
‚Äú The primary outcome of the study would be gestational weight gain , because the more weight you gain during pregnancy - it is associated with a larger baby , and also the more weight you need to lose after delivery . And that increased gestational weight gain is also associated with the risk of developing type 2 diabetes after the pregnancy in the long run , ‚Äù Dr Yew said .
The clinical trial began in September with 20 mums-to-be using the app . It aims to recruit a total of 340 participants over the next 10 months .
Actor Jim Carrey wo n't have to face trial for the wrongful death of his then-girlfriend , Cathriona White , who died from an apparent suicide back in 2015 . Cathriona White 's estranged husband Mark Burton and her mother Brigid Sweetman filed the wrongful death lawsuit in September 2016 , claiming the comedic actor was to blame for her death , due to a drug overdose . Here 's what a publicist for Jim Carrey had to say in a statement about this lawsuit being dismissed .
`` The case and all claims against Jim Carrey have been dismissed . He is extremely grateful to everyone in his life who supported him throughout this challenging episode . ''
Burton and Sweetman 's original lawsuit claimed that the actor supplied Cathriona White with the prescription drugs that she overdosed on . Cathriona White , an Irish hair and makeup artist , dated Carrey off and on between 2012 and 2015 . White 's body was found with a suicide note written to Carrey . The actor filed a countersuit against Burton and Sweetman for extortion , claiming the lawsuit was nothing more than an attempt to exploit a famous actor . No details were given about the case 's dismissal , but Michael J. Avenatti , an attorney representing White 's family , released the following statement .
`` Mr. Burton and Ms. Sweetman are pleased the case has been resolved . They appreciate the support they have received worldwide . ''
The Hollywood Reporter first broke the news on this lawsuit being dismissed , stating that a rep for Jim Carrey confirmed that the matters were cleared on January 25 , adding that the actor was looking forward to moving on with his life . Their report revealed that Avenatti would only say that , `` We have no further comment at this time , '' but the attorney released the above statement to E ! Online a day later . Whether or not there was any sort of financial settlement between the two parties remains unclear .
In September 2017 , attorneys for White presented a 2013 iPad note that was allegedly sent from White to Carrey , where she claims Carrey introduced her to , `` cocaine , prostitutes , mental abuse and disease , '' including HSV and HPV . The actor stated in his countersuit that White knew the claims were false , but she pushed forward knowing just the allegations alone would impact the actor 's career . Carrey 's attorney , Raymond Boucher , filed a motion with the court , compelling Burton to produce White 's STD results . Boucher came to the conclusion that a 2011 document that proved White was free of STD 's before meeting Carey was a forgery .
Jim Carrey was most recently seen in the Netflix documentary entitled Jim & Andy : The Great Beyond , which debuted in November . The actor was also recently seen in The Bad Batch and he also created and produced the HBO series I 'm Dying Up Here . The Hollywood Reporter broke the news on this lawsuit being dismissed .
NEW YORK : Warren Buffett 's Berkshire Hathaway has sold off its stake in General Electric , according to US regulatory papers filed on Monday ( Aug 14 ) .
Berkshire had previously held 10.4 million shares in the US industrial giant , according to earlier securities filings .
But GE was no longer listed among the 20 or so Berkshire stakes , according to the company 's filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission .
Shares of General Electric are down nearly 20 per cent thus far in 2017 , a stark under-performance compared with the index , which has risen more than 11 per cent .
GE has been hurt by weakness in its oil and gas business .
The company in June announced that longtime chief executive Jeff Immelt was retiring and would be replaced by GE veteran John Flannery . But a disappointing outlook during the company 's July earnings conference call further pressured shares .

Shares in GE dipped 0.4 per cent in after-hours trading to US $ 25.27 , while Synchrony rose 4.4 per cent to US $ 30.95 .

The unsealed search warrants do n't confirm the source of the drug , fentanyl , that led to the 57-year-old singer 's accidental , self-administered overdose last April , according to The Star Tribune .
Investigators found no prescriptions in Prince 's name , however , Dr. Michael Todd Schulenberg told detectives he had written a prescription for oxycodone , which is also an opioid , under the name of long-time Prince associate and drummer Kirk Johnson .
Between April 21 and Sept. 19 , 2016 , Carver County authorities conducted investigations into Prince 's death with a total of 11 search warrants .
With failure comes frustration , and with frustration there is a need to ratchet up the panic-stricken rhetoric , Harsanyi writes . ( Photo : J. Scott Applewhite / AP )
Whenever passable Republican legislation materializes ‚Äî a rarity these days ‚Äî Democrats quickly warn that thousands , or perhaps even millions , of lives are at stake . Tax reform ? Health care ? Bogus international treaties ? Internet regulations that were only instituted last year ? It really does n't matter . Longstanding conservative ideas are not only wrong ; they portend the end of America as we know it .
Why are liberals so apocalyptic and bellicose about tax reform ( a rare cut that is , according to the sometimes-reliable Washington Post fact-checkers , only the eighth largest in history ) ? Well , everyone in politics tends to dramatize the consequences of policy for effect . A modern Democratic Party drifting toward Bernie-ism , though , is far more likely to legitimately perceive any cuts in taxation as a limiting of state control , and thus , an attack on all decency and morality . Taxation , after all , is the finest tool of redistribution . So it 's understandable .
But that 's not all of it . With failure comes frustration , and with frustration there is a need to ratchet up the panic-stricken rhetoric . It 's no longer enough to hang nefarious personal motivations on your political opponents ‚Äî although it certainly ca n't hurt ! Good political activists must now corrupt language and ideas to imbue their ham-fisted arguments with some kind of basic plausibility .
The most obvious and ubiquitous of the left 's contorted contentions about the tax bill deliberately muddles the concept of giving and the concept of taking . This distortion is so embedded in contemporary political rhetoric that I 'm not sure most of the progressive foot soldiers even think it 's odd to say anymore .
‚Äú You really should n't lower everyone 's taxes , because it creates deficits and makes it harder to expand important programs like Medicaid ‚Äù does n't have quite the same jolt as ‚Äú You 're killing the poor ! ‚Äù And yet , whatever you make of the separate tax bills in the House and Senate , the authors are not taking one penny from anyone ( unless you consider debt a tax on future generations , which does n't seem to be the case for either party ) . In fact , no spending is being cut ( unfortunately ) . Not one welfare program is being given a block grant . Not one person is losing a subsidy . It 's just a traditional wide-ranging tax cut without any concurrent spending cuts .
To believe that taxing at a moderately lower rate is the same as ‚Äú taking ‚Äù from the poor , you must believe the following : Some arbitrary rates concocted by politicians many years ago for corporations , child credits or deductions are now baselines that all future generations must hold sacred and/or the state has a natural right to your property , and whatever you keep is stolen from the collective .
Or , of course , you might just be extraordinarily dishonest .
Our progressive federal tax code already places most of the tax burden on the wealthy , but perhaps you believe they should pay more . I get it ; you 're worried about income inequality . On the other hand , it is preposterous to claim ‚Äî as many journalists have ‚Äî that lowering rates across the board is a state-sponsored ‚Äú transfer ‚Äù of wealth .
For that matter , overturning the Obamacare mandate to purchase health insurance ‚Äî a market coercion masquerading as a tax for purely legal purposes ‚Äî does not mean that any Americans will have lost ‚Äú access ‚Äù to health care insurance , as the vast majority of liberal pundits claim . That the left deliberately confuses consumer choice with a lack of availability says something about its growing authoritarian inclinations . These perversions of basic language are n't new , but they are becoming more prevalent .

BAGHDAD : Islamic State is talking to al Qaeda about a possible alliance as Iraqi troops close in on IS fighters in Mosul , Iraqi Vice President Ayad Allawi said in an interview on Monday .
Allawi said he got the information on Monday from Iraqi and regional contacts knowledgeable about Iraq .
`` The discussion has started now , '' Allawi said . `` There are discussions and dialogue between messengers representing Baghdadi and representing Zawahiri , '' referring to Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al Baghdadi and Ayman al Zawahiri , the head of al Qaeda .
Islamic State split from al Qaeda in 2014 and the two groups have since waged an acrimonious battle for recruits , funding and the mantle of global jihad . Zawahiri has publicly criticized Islamic State for its brutal methods , which have included beheadings , drownings and immolation .
It is unclear how exactly the two group may work together , Allawi said .
Islamic State blazed across large swathes of northern Iraq in 2014 , leaving the Iraqi central government reeling . Baghdadi declared a caliphate over the territory the group controlled from the al-Nuri mosque in Mosul the same year , which also became a point of contention with al Qaeda .
Last October , Iraqi security forces and Shi'ite volunteer fighters , commonly referred to as the Popular Mobilization Units teamed up with an international coalition , including the United States , to drive Islamic State from of Mosul and the areas surrounding the city .
The group has been pushed out of the half of Mosul that lies east of the Tigris River , but Iraqi soldiers and their allies are now bogged down in tough fighting in the narrow streets of the Old City of Mosul , west of the river , according to Iraqi security officials .
Islamic State has used suicide bombers , snipers and armed drones to defend the territory under their control . The group has also repeatedly targeted civilians or used them as human shields during the fighting , according to Iraqi and American security officials .
The militant group has lost ground in Mosul but still controls the towns of Qaim , Hawija and Tal Afar in Iraq as well as Raqqa , their de facto capital in Syria .
Even if Islamic State loses its territory in Iraq , Allawi said , it will not simply go away .
`` I ca n't see ISIS disappearing into thin air , '' Allawi said , referring to the group by a commonly used acronym . `` They will remain covertly in sleeping cells , spreading their venom all over the world . ''

A group of citizens in Illinois City is working to build a veterans memorial for the town . Currently , the only veteran 's memorial site they have sits in the cemetery .
‚Äú I did n't mind serving my country , ‚Äù said Kevin Killkenny , president of the Illinois city veteran 's memorial committee .
It 's a choice Kevin Killkenny chose . Putting his life on the line for his country .
‚Äú Yes I was on a submarine during the Vietnam war , ‚Äù said Killkenny .
He says he was fortunate enough to come home . Even after leaving the navy , serving and giving back is something , he still enjoys . That 's why he did n't mind forming a committee when a community member was interested in seeing a veteran 's memorial built in Illinois City .
‚Äú Gives me the opportunity to continue to serve my community , my state , and my nation , ‚Äù said Killkenny .
Right now , the only veteran 's memorial site the city has is a marker in their local cemetery . That reads ‚Äú In memory of all veterans ‚Äù . Killkenny says as a veteran himself , he knows just how meaningful this would be .
‚Äú Service to community and nation run deep in this community , ‚Äù said Killkenny .
The group is currently fundraising and looking at finding a company to build the site . They plan to have it go on the corner of 124th Avenue and 238 Street , next to the fire department , which donated the space for free .
‚Äú If you see right behind me on this corner is where the memorial will be placed . This property was donated by the Illinois City Fire Department , said Killkenny .
Although the site sits empty and the only thing some may see is cement . Killkenny says they eventually hope to have it look like a headstone , which will have the names of veterans , who gave the ultimate sacrifice .
‚Äú Be reminded of the sacrifices that our fellow veterans have made , ‚Äù said Killkenny .
They say their goal is to raise 20-thousand dollars . They expect to have the site completed by Veterans Day next year .

EXPAND These are the first images being released of the new facility , which opens this weekend for a video game competition . Blizzard Entertainment
As the popularity of esports has risen over the past handful of years , Blizzard Entertainment has made a name for itself as more than just the company that created classic video games like Diablo and World of Warcraft . Competitive titles like Hearthstone , Heroes of the Storm , and last year 's award-winning Overwatch have all become staples in the gaming industry , and now the Irvine-based company is taking what is arguably its biggest step yet .
After years of brainstorming and planning , the 450-seat Blizzard Arena will open its doors on Oct. 7 for the finals of this Overwatch Contenders season . Although it wo n't be the first esports-dedicated venue ‚Äî Esports Arena in Santa Ana has been the area 's go-to option and Blizzard opened a smaller stadium in Taipei earlier this year ‚Äî the new Burbank facility is based around giving the company 's devoted players and fans an experience they typically only get if they 're one of the 25,000 people who attend Blizzcon in Anaheim every year .
‚Äú What players and fans can expect when they come to Blizzard Arena is just walking into a facility that 's been designed to be able to support esports competitions and create the best-in-class experience around that , ‚Äù says Adam Rosen , Blizzard 's senior business operations manager of esports . ‚Äú One of the things we love to do as Blizzard is to create these monumental moments where we can communicate with players ‚Äî and players can come from all over the world to interact not only with our games , but with each other . Blizzard Arena gives us the opportunity to do that year-round . ‚Äù
From the lobby and merchandise themed specifically to whatever event is taking place to the stadium 's Hall of Champions and trophy case , Blizzard Arena not only lends a sense of permanence to Los Angeles ' esports community but also a look back on some of its history . Sure , you 'll only be seeing official Blizzard events there ‚Äî which means members of the fighting game community will still be making their weekly trek to Orange County ‚Äî but having a world-class venue in the heart of an entertainment capital can only be viewed as a positive for the industry as a whole .
EXPAND Blizzard Entertainment
In addition to giving Blizzard a home base for its live events , the arena will also provide a secondary focus on the lifeblood of esports : streaming . While the NFL has network TV deals , esports is a community that 's been built on broadcasting over the internet via mediums like Twitch and YouTube . For that reason , Rosen says Blizzard Arena has been set up to provide the best possible experience not only for the fans inside of the venue but also the ones watching through their phones , tablets , computers and consoles .
Aside from being able to permanently set up their technology ( rather than having to take it down and start from scratch for each weekend 's events at various locations ) , Blizzard will be able to record and stream multiple broadcasts from the venue at any given time ‚Äî allowing fans to watch the competitions going on in the arena itself as well as any broadcasts they 're streaming from private studios away from the spotlight .
‚Äú Historically , we 've had events all over the world , and we 've also had broadcasts with our players playing onstage , but the broadcasts happened in studios and other places that are n't open to the public , ‚Äù Rosen says . ‚Äú Blizzard Arena gives us a really great opportunity to create this awesome experience where we can invite our players and our fans to be a part of the events with us on a more ongoing basis .
‚Äú One of the things that 's important to us is to make our broadcasts compelling to the fans , ‚Äù Rosen continues . ‚Äú We see the arena as a way to improve the quality of the narrative around our players and their stories by integrating technology to grasp their stories in a way that would be really difficult with broadcasts that were being developed all over the world and were n't connected as well . ‚Äù
As much as Blizzard Arena symbolizes the company 's investment in the future of esports , it also provides a look at the history and future of entertainment . It was n't too long ago that video gaming was still looked at as nothing more than a children 's pastime , and it was n't long before that when people still were n't sold on smartphones ‚Äî or the internet , for that matter . But as the crew at Blizzard looks to push entertainment into the future with esports , the new venue happens to carry a very familiar address from one of the mediums it 's cutting into .
‚Äú [ The location of ] Blizzard Arena is really important to us , because it was the former home of The Tonight Show , and it held a number of breakthroughs for television and entertainment , ‚Äù Rosen says . ‚Äú We 're excited to usher in the next generation of entertainment through Blizzard Arena as well . For those who are n't familiar with esports , it 's everything that you know and love about sports merged with everything you know and love about entertainment in one of the most compelling live event experiences . Esports is the future of entertainment . ‚Äù

QUETTA , Pakistan : At least six policemen were killed and 15 security personnel were wounded Tuesday ( Apr 24 ) when three suicide bombers blew themselves up in quick succession in southwest Pakistan , officials said .
The attacks hit the city of Quetta in the southwestern province of Balochistan , where police and troops have been fighting Islamist militants and separatist groups for more than a decade .
`` The first suicide bomber blew himself up outside a paramilitary frontier corps checkpost in the outskirts of Quetta city after he was spotted by the guards , '' Ghulam Ali Baloch , home secretary of Balochistan told AFP .
`` Just in the next moments , another bomber who was covering the first attacker exchanged fire with the security forces and later blew himself up . ''
Some eight paramilitary officials were wounded in this attack , he said .
Around half an hour later a third bomber drove his motorcycle into a police truck on a road leading to the airport , killing at least six policemen , Baloch added .

Moazam Jah Ansari , Quetta 's police chief , confirmed the attacks and said the bombing of the police truck was so powerful that the vehicle overturned .
It was not clear whether the third bomber was wearing an explosive vest or if the bike was filled with explosives .
`` Seven policemen were injured in this attack , '' he said , adding that the three blasts may have been coordinated .
No group immediately claimed responsibility for the attacks .
Islamist militants and separatist groups have waged violence in mineral-rich Balochistan , which borders Iran and Afghanistan , for more than a decade .
Balochistan is the largest of Pakistan 's four provinces but its roughly seven million people have long argued they do not get a fair share of its vast gas and mineral wealth .

Manchester United manager Jose Mourinho became involved in a physical confrontation with Manchester City 's players after complaining about their post-derby celebrations , according to British media reports late on Sunday .
The Daily Mail and Daily Telegraph said Mourinho went to City 's changing room following United 's 2-1 defeat at Old Trafford because he felt their noisy celebrations were disrespectful .
The newspapers reported Mourinho had a verbal altercation with City goalkeeper Ederson before having water and milk thrown at him by City 's players and being hit on the head with a plastic bottle .
The Mail said United 's security had to break up a brawl involving 20 players and staff members from both clubs , which was said to have occurred near the Old Trafford tunnel .
City 's victory sent them 11 points clear of United at the top of the Premier League table , further enhancing their status as red-hot favourites for the title .
The reports of the Mourinho incident brought to mind the ‚Äú Battle of the Buffet ‚Äù that erupted after United beat Arsenal in October 2004 , when Arsenal midfielder Cesc Fabregas threw pizza at United manager Alex Ferguson .
BUFFALO , N.Y. ( WIVB ) ‚Äî A day after Tyrod Taylor was benched for the Bills ' season finale versus the New York Jets ‚Äì a game the Bills lost by 20 ‚Äì the second-year starter vented his frustrations to reporters , calling the decision unfair .
‚Äú I did n't lose my starting job , ‚Äù Taylor said . ‚Äú It was taken from me . ‚Äù
He continued : ‚Äú Definitely disappointed in how [ the benching ] went down‚Ä¶ There 's a business side to this thing . I 'm not a rookie , I knew that . You just have to deal with it . ‚Äù
Taylor said he spoke briefly to GM Doug Whaley about the decision , one that was in all likelihood motivated by the injury clause in Taylor 's contract that would hand him a massive payday were he to sustain a serious injury . Taylor said Whaley mentioned the decision also factored in a desire to see the other quarterbacks get playing time , but he 's not satisfied with that explanation as it relates to his future .
Tyrod was asked if the benching shows a lack of confidence in him on the part of the Bills .
‚Äú That 's fair to say , ‚Äù he said . ‚Äú That 's what I think it showed . ‚Äù
Taylor 's contract allows for the Bills to cut him after this season if they so desire . If they choose to keep him , his salary will increase to $ 27.5 million next year .

Fast-growing `` superstar '' tech firms are taking a growing share of national income in many countries , leaving workers ' overall wage growth subdued , the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development said on Wednesday .
PARIS : Fast-growing `` superstar '' tech firms are taking a growing share of national income in many countries , leaving workers ' overall wage growth subdued , the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development said on Wednesday .
Though unemployment in most OECD countries has returned to pre-crisis levels , wage growth has not , even though many labor markets have become the tightest they have ever been , the Paris-based policy forum said in its annual Employment Outlook .

One legacy of the 2008-2009 global economic crisis is that many workers were forced to accept low-pay jobs afterwards , weighing on overall wage growth .
The OECD said another factor was at play with overall productivity gains in most economies no longer translating into higher wages for all workers as they did in the past .
The reasons for slow post-crisis wage growth has been one of the great economic debates in recent years as stronger labor markets have in the past fueled higher overall wages and thus higher inflation .
Weighing into the debate , the OECD suggested what it called `` superstar '' firms could be partly to blame for weak wage growth , which slowed on average in OECD countries to 1.2 percent after accounting for inflation , down from 2.2 percent before the crisis .

It said much of the productivity growth has been generated by a small of number of innovative firms that invest massively in technology but employ few workers compared to other more traditional companies .
As a result , the overall share of national income going to workers , rather than investors , has declined on average in the OECD , led by the United States , Ireland , Korea and Japan .
It said for now there was no evidence that emergence of superstar firms was creating anti-competitive forces , but it also did not rule that out as a future danger .
`` A key challenge for product market regulation and competition policy going forward will be to prevent emerging dominant players from engaging in anti-competitive practices , '' the OECD said .

Instead of recommending an anti-trust clamp-down as some politicians in the United States have proposed , the OECD said the way to help workers would be to give them better skills an education .
It also said collective bargaining between workers ' reps and employers could help reduce wage inequality .

Disney has finally found a director for its highly-anticipated Mulan remake , with New Zealand filmmaker Niki Caro signing on to take the helm . This news comes just a few months after Ang Lee passed on the project back in October . But now the project is back on the right track . This hiring also makes Niki Caro the second female director at the studio to be at the helm for a project budgeted at over $ 100 million , following in the footsteps of Ava DuVernay and her film A Wrinkle In Time . Along with adding Niki Caro , the Mulan remake has brought on veteran Chinese producer William Hong as an executive producer .
The Hollywood Reporter reveals that Disney was considering other female filmmakers such as Wonder Woman 's Patty Jenkins and celebrated TV director Michelle MacLaren ( Breaking Bad , Game of Thrones , The Walking Dead ) . With Niki Caro taking the reins on this project , that most likely means she 's out of the running to direct Captain Marvel , since a report from August revealed she was one of the front runners , along with Lesli Linka Glatter ( Mad Men ) and Lorene Scafaria ( The Meddler ) . The studio is again trying to assure fans that this Mulan movie will be culturally responsible .
The studio also sought Wen Jiang , who starred in Rogue One : A Star Wars Story and is an accomplished Chinese director , but that did n't pan out . The project originated from a spec script Disney purchased in 2015 from writers Elizabeth Martin and Lauren Hynek . Then in October , a report surfaced that the spec script centers on a `` 30-something European trader who initially cares only for the pleasure of women and money , '' who becomes Mulan 's love interest . This sparked quite the controversy , forcing Disney to release a statement that all of the main characters in this Mulan remake will be Chinese .
Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver ( Dawn of the Planet of the Apes ) were also brought in to rewrite the original spec script Disney bought last year from Lauren Hynek and Elizabeth Martin . The spec script is said to be a `` jumping off point '' for a `` more nuanced and elaborate adaptation , '' that combines elements of the original Chinese ballad with the 1998 animated film . Disney has already set a November 2 , 2018 release date for this Mulan remake , putting it up against an untitled Fox/Marvel superhero film and an untitled Paramount event film . Chris Bender , Jason Reed and Jake Weiner are producing with William Kong executive producing .
The original film followed a young woman who disguises herself as a man so she can take her father 's place in the army and go to war . With the help of her trusty dragon sidekick Mushu , she becomes a skilled Chinese warrior and , eventually , one of the country 's greatest heroines . It earned $ 304.3 million worldwide , earned Golden Globe and Academy Award nominations and spawned the 2005 direct-to-DVD sequel , Mulan II . Disney is reportedly focusing its casting search in mainland China for the title role and other characters as well . The studio is also bringing in Chinese cultural consultants along with the studio 's own team in China for this new version of Mulan . William Kong has produced some of China 's biggest hits , including films have have had success in the U.S. such as Crouching Tiger , Hidden Dragon , Hero and House of Flying Daggers . He has also produced Chinese blockbusters such as Monster Hunt , Wolf Totem and Journey to the West . Niki Caro most recently directed McFarland USA for Disney , and her next film , The Zookeeper 's Wife , hits theaters on March 31 .
With questions being asked over the sustainability of the famed ‚Äò Kerala model ' of social development in the absence of corresponding growth in the productive sectors of the economy , the Left Front government has set in motion a new experiment .
A brainchild of Finance Minister Thomas Isaac , the new initiative seeks to raise funds outside of state budget to finance infrastructure projects . The funds will be mobilised and channelised to various government agencies by a special purpose vehicle ( SPV ) called Kerala Infrastructure Investment Fund Board ( KIIFB ) .
Its main source of the fund is general obligation bonds against unconditional government guarantee and revenue bonds with structured payment mechanism to be issued by the state government . An additional source is the profit from an exclusive chit fund that the government will be introducing for Non-Resident Keralites ( NRK ) from April this year .
The government will give the proceeds from the petrol and vehicle cess it introduced in 2015 to KIIFB to meet the repayment obligations . The agency has been given a tall target of mobilising Rs 1 lakh crore for financing infrastructure projects .
The agency has already received project proposals worth Rs 54,000 crore . Out of these , projects to the tune of Rs 17.28 crore are under various stages of approval . The finance minister has declared a moratorium on new proposals . Instead , he has passed on almost all new projects and schemes he has announced in his budget for 2018-19 to KIIFB .
This includes a Rs 3,500 crore scheme for the revival of the perennially red Kerala State Road Transport Corporation ( KSRTC ) and a Rs 2,500 crore scheme for building houses for the homeless . This has helped Isaac to get the revenue deficit below the last year 's level .
If all the projects materialise as envisaged by the finance minister , KIIB will have to find Rs 1 lakh crore over a period of 10 years to repay the debt at nine percent interest . The government will have to provide the fund since no return is expected from the projects to be financed by the KIIFB .
The bulk of the projects sanctioned by the agency so far is upgradation of schools , colleges and hospitals and construction of rural roads , which do not generate any revenue unless the government introduces fees and tolls . The government has no such plan . This means the government will have to provide the required funds to KIIFB from state exchequer as a government grant .
Isaac , a trained economist , is confident that the government will meet its obligations . But economists and opposition parties are not impressed since the state is already grappling with an outstanding liability of Rs 2.40 lakh crore and debts to the tune of Rs 1.37 lakh crore . The debt is bound to go up in the coming years since the state is virtually living hand to mouth .
With the salaries and pensions alone accounting for more than 70 percent of the state 's annual revenue , the state government is left with no money to meet even the non-plan expenditure . The gap between revenue receipts and expenditure has been widening over the years .
While expenditure increased by 22 percent in the current year , revenue went up by only 7.6 percent . The current financial year will close with a deficit of Rs 13,080 crore . The revenue estimated for 2018-19 is Rs 1,02,801 crore as against the estimated expenditure of Rs 1,15,661.05 crore . In spite of passing the burden on the new projects to KIIBF , the deficit for 2018-19 is estimated to be Rs 12,859.81 crore .
The government has earmarked the cess on petrol , diesel and vehicles for KIIFB , but the proceeds from it are meagre . This yielded only Rs 629 crore in 2016-17 . The yield in the current year is expected to be Rs 1,042 crore . This will not be sufficient even to pay the interest on the debt fund to be mobilised by KIIFB .
VK Vijayakumar , a chief investment strategist , termed KIIFB is a big gamble , which has a high probability for failure . He feels that the new growth strategy can backfire and land the state in a serious fiscal crisis if the government is unable to raise funds for the debt repayment .
`` No one will object to infrastructure investment through borrowings . But , the problem with KIIFB-led growth strategy is that part of the borrowed money is to be spent on projects that will not yield revenue , like housing for the poor , '' Vijayakumar said in an article in the Deccan Chronicle .
He pointed out that KIIFB itself had a pathetic performance in the last two years , with targets for fund mobilisation and expenditure falling short by a huge margin . Revenue expectations from higher growth are too optimistic particularly in the context of falling West Asian remittances impacting growth , he added .
Vijayakumar strongly feels that the state should focus on attracting investments as it lags far behind other states . The state 's future economic growth should be private investment-led growth , he said .
‚Äú Unfortunately , the budget talks about more investment in PSUs . Kerala has 96 PSUs under different departments , with accumulated losses of Rs 13,969 crore till 2016 . Pouring more money into these black holes , as the budget attempts to do , does n't make economic sense , ‚Äù Vijayakumar said .
Opposition leaders have termed the budget as a KIIB-led exercise . State Congress vice-president and MLA VD Satheesan said Isaac had used the agency to free the government from its responsibility to steer the development .
‚Äú Isaac has reduced the budget as a mere accounting exercise by passing the burden of implementing the projects and schemes to KIIFB . He also had nothing to do with the tax as GST will take care of it . With the exclusion of tax and development activities , what Isaac presented on Friday can not be termed a budget , '' Satheesan said .
But what is worrying the opposition parties is the lack of accountability of KIIFB . Kerala Congress ( M ) leader and former finance minister KM Mani said the funds the agency mobilises and spends will be outside the purview of the Assembly .
Adikesavan , a banker , said that the finance minister could have tabled a report on KIIFB and fund it collects and spends separately as part of the budget to silence the sceptics . He said this was important since KIIFB is emerging as an alternative pole of the government 's strategy for development .
He said that the new model was unavoidable since the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act had placed restrictions on fiscal deficits . This has left little room for the states to borrow funds from the market .
Isaac justified the new model saying that the Central government had prevented the state from borrowing for three months last year . He termed KIIFB as a financial innovation to bypass the Central Act .
‚Äú When borrowing is stopped , we have to borrow through special institutions outside the budget . If the government waits for its own funds for the development , it will take years . For the young generation , it is better these developments happen now . We can not sit idle and bid the time , ‚Äù Isaac said .
A federal appeals court reduced by US $ 2 million the legal fees that Sears Holdings Corp and Whirlpool Corp must pay to settle a class action lawsuit over defective washing machines . The reason : the case was not that complicated .
REUTERS : A federal appeals court reduced by US $ 2 million the legal fees that Sears Holdings Corp and Whirlpool Corp must pay to settle a class action lawsuit over defective washing machines . The reason : the case was not that complicated .
The 7th U.S . Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago on Monday cut to US $ 2.7 million from US $ 4.77 million the sum owed to the plaintiffs ' lawyers .
Shoppers alleged that Whirlpool-manufactured front-loading washing machines they had bought at Sears , under the Whirlpool and Kenmore brands , were prone to failure because of defective control units and mold .
A lower court judge last September cited the `` presence of novel and complex legal issues '' as a factor to justify awarding the plaintiffs ' lawyers 1.75 times the base fees they charged . Such multipliers are common in class action settlements .
Circuit Judge Richard Posner , however , said the appeals court was `` puzzled '' by the `` questionable '' decision to award a multiplier , given that a case 's novelty and complexity was typically reflected in base fees .
The lower court judge `` concluded that for the most part the case was n't very complex - it was just about whether or not Sears had sold defective washing machines , '' Posner wrote .

Lawyers for the plaintiffs did not immediately respond to requests for comment .
The settlement followed nine years of litigation . Damages have not been determined , but Sears and Whirlpool have estimated that the total payout to class members may not exceed US $ 900,000 .
In a joint statement , Sears and Whirlpool said the appeals court correctly reduced the `` excessive and unreasonable '' fee award , and said fees in similar cases should generally be lower than sums the plaintiffs recover .
The case is In re : Sears , Roebuck and Co Front-Loading Washer Products Liability Litigation , 7th U.S . Circuit Court of Appeals , No . 16-3554 .

Shillong : The Centre 's decision to repeal AFSPA from Meghalaya was on Tuesday unanimously welcomed by political parties , students ' organisations and church leaders of the state .
Meghalaya home minister James K Sangma said he was grateful to the Union government for considering the state 's request of revoking The Armed Forces ( Special Powers ) Act from the state .
`` We are thankful to the Centre for responding to the Meghalaya government 's request for denotification of AFSPA in the Garo Hills areas , adjoining Assam , '' he told PTI , adding militancy has been `` by and large contained '' in the state and this was made possible by the Meghalaya police .
A home ministry official had on Monday said the Centre has revoked AFSPA , which empowers security forces to conduct operations and arrest individuals without prior notice , from the entire state of Meghalaya and parts of Arunachal Pradesh , with effect from 31 March .
Lauding the Centre 's move , the Congress credited the erstwhile Mukul Sangma-led government for it .
`` The imposition of AFSPA had lots of demerits in a state like Meghalaya , as it has often been seen that language barrier led to atrocities here . This was the reason why former chief minister Mukul Sangma did not allow the army to take up operations in the Garo Hills , '' Congress spokesperson Zenith Sangma said .
He said Mukul Sangma focused on raising Special Force-10 , the state 's own anti-insurgency force , to bring peace in the state .
Meghalaya is the first state to have its own anti-insurgency force , the Congress spokesperson said .
The North East Students Organisation ( NESO ) demanded revocation of the `` controversial law '' from the other states of the region .
`` The NESO welcomes the decision of Ministry of Home Affairs to revoke AFSPA from Meghalaya . In fact , we want the act to be removed from all northeastern states where it is in force at the moment , '' its chairman Samuel B Jyrwa told PTI .
The act has only given undue authority to the armed forces to `` torture and kill people at will '' , he said .
`` AFSPA failed miserably in containing militant activities . It has only led to human rights violations by the armed forces , '' Jyrwa alleged , adding even after 27 years of the imposition of the act in Meghalaya , it did not have any positive impact on the law and order situation .
Echoing similar sentiments , former church leader PBM Basaiawmoit said the people of North East can rejoice together once the act is repealed from other states in the region .
`` People will be happy if the draconian law is totally removed from India 's statute books . No one will be considered as the enemy of the state , '' he said .

CHICAGO ( AP ) ¬ó A suburban Chicago high school says safety concerns have prompted it to forfeit a football game against a school on Chicago 's West Side .
St. Francis High School in Wheaton was scheduled to play Chicago Hope Academy on Friday night . But officials at St. Francis say a recent shooting , along with gunshots reported near Little League games at a local park over the summer , convinced the school to keep its team at home .
Chicago Hope Academy played a game at the park on Sept. 29 against another Chicago school that was interrupted by gunfire . No one was injured .
Hope Academy founder Bob Muzikowski says that was the first violent episode in 13 years of football at the school . He says security would have been robust at Friday 's game .

Katy Perry ‚Äò s Twitter bio reads , ‚Äú I know nothing , ‚Äù and it 's becoming clear she 's right .
The ‚Äú Swish Swish ‚Äù singer , 32 , has been giving the promo tour for her newest album , ‚Äú Witness , ‚Äù all of her time and effort , but with every interview it becomes increasingly clear that Perry ca n't decide who she is .
Born Katheryn Hudson , Perry ditched her given identity and the ideals of her Pentecostal preacher parents in favor of musical freedom . Her major life choice led her to skyrocket to fame with her hit single , ‚Äú I Kissed a Girl , ‚Äù and the rest was pop history .
Then on the heels of one of the most contentious presidential elections in which Perry campaigned hard for Hillary Clinton , Perry took on a new role when she became ‚Äú woke . ‚Äù
But in a profile for the New York Times , released Wednesday , Perry explained that no part of her former self is left .
‚Äú I did n't kill her , because I love [ Katheryn Hudson ] , and she is exactly what I had to do then , ‚Äù Perry told the New York Times . ‚Äú And I 'm not a con artist , I did n't con people , like , that was just me . And this is me now . ‚Äù
She further explained that transitioning into the ‚Äú Witness ‚Äù era was ‚Äú necessary ‚Äù for her growth .
‚Äú It 's a departure , and it 's a necessary evolution that I have to take , ‚Äù she said . ‚Äú And I know that sometimes it feels publicly like I 'm dragging cement blocks , but like , the pyramids were made out of cement blocks ‚Äî or not cement . But do you know what I 'm trying to say ? I 'm gon na get there . ‚Äù
In an interview with The Guardian released Sunday , Perry flip-flopped and said she never had any intentions to show the world Kathryn Hudson , despite telling the Times she loves her .
‚Äú I was scared that if you saw me , Katheryn Hudson , the girl wearing the Bior√© strip on my nose , you 'd be like , ‚Äò that 's not glamorous ' . It was me going , ‚Äò OK , I 've been upset my whole childhood so I 'm going to show the world I am something , that I am going to do something and that I am enough ' . I did n't want to be Katheryn Hudson , ‚Äù she shared with the Guardian . ‚Äú I hated that , it was too scary for me , so I decided to be someone else . ‚Äù
Notably , Perry explained all this while wearing a Bior√© strip during the interview .
Throughout her interviews , and even her heated ‚Äú Dinner With Discourse ‚Äù live-streamed event , Perry remains consistent on one thing : vocalizing her opinion .
‚Äú Some people said , ‚Äò Look we ca n't do this thing with you anymore because we 've gotten letters ' . Basically , corporations are like , ‚Äò Do n't have an opinion ' , and I 'm like , ‚Äò So if I was vocalizing for the other side , you 'd still get letters , you know that right . ' What they 're asking me to do is not to speak at all , ‚Äù she told The Guardian . ‚Äú So , God bless you on your journey . ‚Äù
RuPaul wants to become your new spiritual adviser .
The drag star and entrepreneur , 57 , plans to release an inspirational book , ‚Äú GuRu , ‚Äù this October .
‚Äú This book is a talisman , a guidebook for living , ‚Äù he told People . ‚Äú [ It 's ] a collection of meaningful phrases and quotes that have helped me navigate the chaos of modern life . ‚Äù
RuPaul , whose full name is RuPaul Andre Charles , has been a reality TV fixture for many years now since he launched ‚Äú RuPaul 's Drag Race ‚Äù in 2009 . He 's also appeared in numerous movies and television shows in addition to singing .
As he tells the publication , the book will also feature more than 80 pictures from his life .
‚Äú I hope that fans will use the book for inspiration , ‚Äù he said . ‚Äú It offers beauty , but also advice , insight and attitude . It 's more than just a bunch of pretty pictures . ‚Äù
He added that his performances are also closely aligned with a higher power .
‚Äú We are spiritual beings having a human experience , ‚Äù he carefully explained . ‚Äú If we approach the experience without judgment , we can open up a vast vista of unlimited colors , textures , shapes and ideas . It 's not important for me to know what God is , it 's only important for me to know that God is , and that we are all an extension of that grace . ‚Äù
Whatever may come from the book , it 's just a small piece of his growing empire .
‚Äú Please . I 've had eight [ Emmy ] nominations , ‚Äù he quipped to The Post 's Cindy Adams in 2017 . ‚Äú And won an Emmy last year . People are finally catching on to me . But wait ‚Ä¶ next is a TV movie about me . Not filmed yet . No title yet . Not cast yet . I wo n't play me . It 's maybe Willow Smith . ‚Äù
‚Äú GuRu ‚Äù will be the star 's second book . He released ‚Äú Workin ' It ! : RuPaul 's Guide to Life , Liberty , and the Pursuit of Style ‚Äù in 2010 .
Protesters turned up at Peter Jolly 's Circus taking place in Scunthorpe over the weekend .
The circus , set up on Scotter Road South , uses performing animals which protesters claim are kept in 'horrendous conditions ' - something the circus 's spokesman and clown Peter Jolly Junior has dismissed as `` completely wrong . ''
One of the protesters , Bethany Burke , said : `` The animals used from zebras to camels to raccoons are wild animals who do n't belong in entertainment .
`` Being part of a travelling circus means they are kept in small enclosures and cages for the majority of their lives and therefore their five freedoms and welfare needs ca n't possibly be being met .
`` A suitable environment is not a small enclosure , being forced to perform night after night , being enclosed for the majority of their day in a cage , being carted around from place to place does not allow them to exhibit normal and natural behaviour .
`` As a nation of animal lovers I am shocked that people still support this barbaric entertainment .
`` If a dog was going through the same torment and horrendous conditions would we stand back and just let it happen ?
`` These animals do n't have a voice , so we 're being their voice and standing up for what is right . I hope that the public do become more educated about animals in circuses and do the right thing in not going . ''
However , Mr Jolly said that all levels of animal care expected by the circus are met .
He said that the circus has announced and unannounced inspections and that paperwork for the animals is filled in every day .
`` We had animal health here last week who came to inspect the animals and they were fully satisfied with everything they saw , '' he said .
`` Our website you can read about our licensing and what we do and do n't do . ''
He also claimed that protesters had taken signs on the road giving directions to the circus .
The circus is on this Wednesday , Thursday and Friday from 6.30pm , Saturday at 2pm and 5pm and Sunday at 2pm .

YOKOHAMA : Ghana gatecrashed Japan 's farewell game before the World Cup - coach Akira Nishino 's first in charge of the Blue Samurai - with a 2-0 win on Wednesday ( May 30 ) .
Thomas Partey put the visitors in front after just nine minutes in rain-lashed Yokohama before an Emmanuel Boateng penalty early in the second further dented Japan 's fragile confidence .

It was a harsh reality check for Nishino , who took charge last month after predecessor Vahid Halilhodzic was abruptly given the boot , plunging Japan 's World Cup preparations into chaos .
`` We tried a lot of things tonight but obviously the result is frustrating , '' said Nishino .
`` We wanted to put in a good performance before the World Cup but we could n't really get into a rhythm and did n't take our chances . ''
Thomas , who plays in Spain at Atletico Madrid and largely goes by his first name , blasted a free kick into the bottom corner to punish Japan after a clumsy foul by Tomoaki Makino on the edge of the box .

Japan 's talisman Keisuke Honda twice went close at the other end , but Boateng stunned the home side by doubling Ghana 's lead from the spot six minutes after halftime .
Nishino cut a dejected figure in a soaked grey sweatshirt and baseball cap , in sharp contrast to Halilhodzic 's dapper pinstripe suits .
The 63-year-old former JFA technical director threw on playmaker Shinji Kagawa , marking his return to the Japan side after an absence with ankle trouble since the start of the year .
Forwards Shinji Okazaki and Gaku Shibasaki also came off the bench as Japan chased goals but the hosts never really threatened a comeback in a poor display .
Japan travels to Europe to take on Switzerland on Jun 6 and Paraguay on Jun 12 in final tune-ups before facing Colombia , Senegal and Poland at the World Cup .
Nishino names his final 23-man World Cup squad for Russia on Thursday .
Japan , who will be playing in their sixth successive World Cup , have only twice reached the last 16 - in 2010 and as co-hosts in 2002 .
NAIROBI , Kenya ‚Äî Namibian media say an elephant trampled and killed an Argentine who was in a group of hunters tracking a herd of elephants .
The Namibia Press Agency said the hunter , identified as 46-year-old Jose Monzalvez , was killed on Saturday afternoon in a private wildlife area 70 kilometres ( 43 miles ) northwest of the small town of Kalkfeld .
The agency said Monzalvez , who worked for an oil company , was with another Argentine and three Namibians when he was killed . It says one of the elephants charged before the group was able to find a spot to aim and shoot .
The report says Monzalvez had a hunting permit with him and that relatives have been informed of his death .
Doug Pederson tugged the Eagles to the Super and Bill Belichick can do no wrong , but this year 's voters looked elsewhere for the game 's most transformative coach .
Sean McVay of the Los Angeles Rams was announced as the 2017 NFL Coach of the Year during Saturday 's NFL Honors award show . McVay received 35 of 50 votes with Minnesota Vikings coach Mike Zimmer ( 11 ) and Jacksonville Jaguars coach Doug Marrone ( 2 ) also receiving votes . The two Super Bowl LII coaches -- Doug Pederson and Bill Belichick -- each received one vote .
The 32-year-old first-year head coach needed just one season to turn a stagnant , hard-to-watch Rams team in an offensive juggernaut that took the NFC West by storm .
McVay 's fingerprints were all over an offense that saw Jared Goff become the game 's most-improved quarterback league-wide in just his second pro season -- upping his passer rating from 63.6 to 100.5 -- while leading the Rams to their first division crown since 2003 .
McVay 's scheme produced the NFL 's top scoring offense this season after Los Angeles finished last in points under Jeff Fisher in 2016 , making the Rams the first team in the Super Bowl era to flip from worst to first in that category .
McVay also helped Todd Gurley author a comeback season for the ages , wiping away 2016 's disappointments with an NFL-best 2,093 yards from scrimmage and the most touchdowns ( 19 ) by a Rams player since Marshall Faulk posted 21 in 2001 .
It was a night to remember for the Rams as they became the first team in NFL history to win Coach of the Year , Offensive Player of the Year ( Gurley ) and Defensive Player of the Year ( Aaron Donald ) honors in the same season .
`` People rave about his work ethic , his creativity and his ability to communicate , and for a guy who 's that young , it 's really , really impressive , '' Seahawks general manager John Schneider told NFL.com 's Michael Silver this season .
`` Anybody that spends five minutes with Sean McVay comes away from it and goes , 'Man , that kid 's not 31 , '' Rams left tackle Andrew Whitworth also told Silver before McVay turned 32 in January . `` It 's kind of the same as when you 're around a truly great player , a future Hall of Famer . You hear people talk about Jonathan Ogden or Anthony Mu√±oz or Deion Sanders , and they say , 'You knew from the beginning this guy was gon na be special . You could just tell he 's different . ' That 's how it is with Sean . ''
The season ended in disappointment for the Rams with January 's wild-card loss to the Falcons , but the future is ultra-bright for Los Angeles with McVay at the controls -- and the voters agree .
BUFFALO , N.Y. ( WIVB ) ‚Äì An alleged cocaine dealer was taken into custody after attempting to evade Erie County Sheriff 's deputies .
Armond Cleague , 33 , of Buffalo , was charged Thursday afternoon with felony criminal possession of a narcotic ( 8 oz . or more ) and criminal possession of a narcotic with intent to sell . He was also charged with unlawfully fleeing a police officer in a motor vehicle .
According to sheriff 's reports , the sheriff 's Narcotics Unit was conducting a six-month-long investigation into Cleague 's drug-dealing activities .
He was arrested near Duerstein Street and Junior Avenue after attempting to flee deputies in a vehicle .
Members of the Narcotics Unit recovered 9 oz . of cocaine and approximately $ 8,800 in U.S. currency .
Cleague is being held at the Erie County Holding Center pending his arraignment .
TAURANGA : An elated India U-19 head coach Rahul Dravid hopes that his World Cup winning wards will have many such lasting memories in the future , adding that the support staff had helped him make the title triumph possible .
‚Äú I am really proud of the boys and the effort they put in . ‚Äú Proud of the effort they put in and could n't be happier for them . Hopefully it 's a memory they cherish for a long , long time , but hopefully not the lasting memory and they have many more great moments and bigger things in future , ‚Äù the batting legend said after India outclassed Australia to win their fourth U-19 World Cup .
‚Äú I do n't want to mention names , but everyone in the support staff has put in a great effort . We do the best for the kids , ‚Äù Dravid added as the boys in blue celebrated loudly behind him .
Electing to bat first , Australia were dismissed for 216 runs in 47.2 overs . Ishan Porel , Shiva Singh and Anukul Roy picked up two wickets each for India .
JANAKPUR , Nepal : At least 175 people have died and thousands have fled their homes as monsoon floods swept across Nepal , India and Bangladesh , officials said on Monday ( Aug 14 ) , warning the toll could rise as the extent of the damage becomes clear .
Three days of relentless downpours sparked flash floods and landslides that have killed at least 80 people in Nepal , 73 across northern and eastern India and 22 in Bangladesh .
Around 200,000 people are living in emergency camps in Assam in northeast India , which suffers frequent flooding during the annual monsoon rains .
Another 15,000 have had to leave their homes in the eastern state of Bihar , which borders Nepal and where one official said seven rivers were at danger levels .
Large parts of the state were submerged in 2008 when a river burst its banks across the border in Nepal , with the two countries trading blame for the disaster .
All trains to the northeast have been suspended until Wednesday , with sections of the track completely submerged in water , Indian railway spokesman Anil Saxena told AFP .

In Nepal , ariel photos taken by an AFP photographer showed huge swathes of land in the southeast still underwater Monday afternoon .
Police said over 48,000 homes have been totally submerged by the floods across Nepal 's southern planes .
As emergency workers struggled to reach far-flung areas , the country 's home ministry said another 36 people were missing , presumed dead , revising down an earlier count after more bodies were found .
The Nepal Red Cross warned that shortages of safe drinking water and food could create a humanitarian crisis in the impoverished Himalayan country .
`` In many parts of the country there is a scarcity of safe drinking water creating a high risk of health hazards , '' spokesman Dibya Raj Poudel told AFP .
`` Several villages and settlements are unreachable . Telecommunications , mobile phones are still not working so it is difficult to give a full assessment . ''
A local volunteer in Saptari district - one of the worst affected areas - said the water level was receding but many people were still stranded on higher ground .
`` Water level has decreased a little bit but families still can not return home . They are taking shelter in sheds . What people need now is clean drinking water and food , '' volunteer Dipak Kumar Yadav told AFP .
On the outskirts of Janakpur , in southeastern Nepal , local residents were sheltering in a local temple after the flood waters had totally destroyed their basic mud homes , though the water had mostly receded .
In India , emergency workers were scouring the area hit by a massive landslide that swept two passenger buses into a deep gorge on Sunday , killing at least 46 people in the mountainous northern state of Himachal Pradesh .
In the neighbouring state of Uttarakhand - which also borders Nepal - three people were killed in a landslide late Sunday triggered by heavy rains , local police official Ajay Joshi told AFP .
BANGLADESH DEPLOYS TROOPS
Bangladesh deployed troops to shore up embankments in the north of the country , where flooding has killed 22 people .
Local government administrator Kazi Hasan Ahmed told AFP up to 700,000 people had been marooned by flood waters after rivers burst their banks following days of heavy rain .
`` We 've not seen such severe floods in Dinajpur since 1988 , '' he said , referring to the worst-hit district .
`` The town protection embankment was washed away by flood water , submerging most of the main town . ''
The government 's Flood Forecasting and Warning Centre warned that water levels in some major rivers would continue to rise over the next 72 hours , raising fears the flooding could spread .
In Nepal , the worst of the flooding was in the southern lowlands known as the Terai , the country 's most fertile region and home to much of its agriculture .
`` We are getting reports that about 70 per cent of agriculture area in the Tarai is inundated , '' said Shankar Sapkota , senior agricultural economist with the government .
`` Paddy fields , vegetable plantation and fish farms have been affected but right now we can not confirm the extent of damage . ''
Nearly 150 people have been killed in Nepal since the beginning of the rainy season in late June .
The rains are now expected to shift westwards and authorities in Nepal have begun evacuating 74,000 people from a vulnerable western district .
Hundreds have died in torrential rain , floods and landslides in neighbouring India during the monsoon , which hits the country 's southern tip in early June and sweeps across the nation , lasting into September .
FORT MYERS , Fla. A highly sensitive court document related to a Lee County child abuse case was made publicly available online for several hours last month .
The information released on the Lee County Clerk of Court website contained graphic details that only a judge and those involved in the case were supposed to see ‚Äî and it 's prompted Clerk of Court Linda Doggett to redouble efforts to protect data .
‚Äú Open records are great ‚Äî they are very beneficial ‚Äî but they also come with a risk and a burden to those who have to try to protect certain information , ‚Äù Doggett said .
Prosecutors in the case had filed a notice asking that the entire document be confidential , but someone within the clerk 's office misread the form , according to Doggett .
‚Äú This incident made us re-evaluate , ‚Äù Doggett said . ‚Äú We retrained all of our clerks . We 've done several sessions of question and answers about what the process should be for each . ‚Äù
It 's not the first time sensitive information from the clerk 's office found its way online .
A software upgrade in February caused the names of 45 crime victims and 12 civil sexual violence victims to be displayed online . Another software upgrade that month put 24 Social Security numbers online .
All of those issues were corrected with 24 hours , the clerk of court 's office said .
Attorneys and law enforcement also play a role in keeping information confidential . The address of a woman who was a victim of stalking had her home address listed in a police report that became public because her address is the address where the crime took place .
‚Äú I can understand no one is perfect , everyone makes human error , ‚Äù the victim said . ‚Äú However , as a victim , I expect protection , and to see that happen , it kind of made me lose faith . ‚Äù
WINK News has chosen not to identify the woman or the law enforcement agency involved in the case to protect her identity .
Clerk of courts staff has been meeting with members of the legal community to streamline the process of filing forms in an effort to keep more confidential information from getting out , Doggett said .
They 're also going back and looking at five years ' worth of cases to determine how often it 's happened .
At age 17 , Romola Garai was given the opportunity to star in the 2004 sequel of the classic 1987 film ‚Äú Dirty Dancing. ‚Äù However , the British actress does n't have fond memories of her time on set .
The now 34-year-old told The Guardian how a female producer pointed at her thighs while she stood in her underwear and declared ‚Äú This is n't good enough . ‚Äù
Garai even described how she was ‚Äú weighed in and out every day with a dietician flown to Puerto Rico ‚Äù to ensure she stayed ‚Äú underweight ‚Äù for the leading role in ‚Äú Dirty Dancing : Havana Nights . ‚Äù
‚Äú It screwed me up for years , ‚Äù explained Garai to the UK-based publication . ‚Äú Not only did it completely changed how I felt about my body , but I felt like I 'd failed because I had n't fought back . I felt complicit , because I did n't say no . I signed off on Photoshopped images and felt terrible for perpetrating this‚Ä¶ lie . ‚Äù
‚Äú Someone said the only thing that was convincing in the whole film was the look of pure misery in my eyes , ‚Äù she added . Garai described the experience as her ‚Äú feminist epiphany . ‚Äù
While Garai did pursue modeling as a teenager , she insisted that no one ever told her to lose weight until she took on the role of Katey Miller opposite Mexican star Diego Luna as Javier Suarez .
‚Äú It 's different with film , because it 's not about the weight , it 's about control , ‚Äù she said . ‚Äú It 's an industry with a clear agenda of ensuring women 's relationships with their reflection on screen make them feel inadequate . I never went back to Hollywood again . ‚Äù
Garai did eventually pursue acting again after she studied at university . She described still being told to change by producers , except this time it has nothing to do with the scale .
‚Äú I 've had sporadic acne in my life and have extraordinary conversations with them about how I ca n't have spots on screen , telling me about the drugs I should take , ‚Äù she added . ‚Äú There 's this idea that in order to propagate visions women aspire to , you have to make other women feel bad . ‚Äù
Garai also mentioned how she was told to behave towards her male co-stars .
‚Äú OK , I 've had a female director say to me that the male actor is really challenged by aggressive women , so I have to be delicate with the way I speak to him , ‚Äù she said . ‚Äú I said : ‚Äò I ca n't tell you how hard that will be for me . I am not that kind of person . ' There are hundreds of misogynistic directors , but an equal number who are not . It 's a mistake to make it a gender split . That 's not helped the cause . ‚Äù
BUFFALO , N.Y. ( WIVB ) ‚Äì Terry and Kim Pegula have bought yet another building in the city 's Cobblestone District , leading many observers to wonder if the Pegulas are building up their real estate portfolio in anticipation of a new downtown football stadium .
The Pegulas , owners of the Buffalo Bills pro football team , and the Buffalo Sabres hockey franchise , have purchased the Carr Building , at Michigan Avenue and Perry Street . That acquisition is heating up speculation about the Pegulas ' plans for downtown .
The Carr Building is across Michigan Avenue from the Buffalo Creek Casino‚Äîa magnet for downtown entertainment . The Pegulas have already spent millions on the HarborCenter , and last year they bought the Hi-Temp Fabrication Building , across Illinois Street from the KeyBank Center .
Common Coucilmember David Franczyk 's Fillmore District encompasses all of the Pegulas ' downtown property , and he is feeling optimistic about the power couple 's commitment , ‚Äú You are seeing a permanency with the Pegulas , that this is really their place to grow and build and protect their teams . So I think it is an encouraging sign . ‚Äù
But the proximity of those properties to the Commodore Perry Homes , land that is in the cross hairs of new football stadium talk , ca n't be brushed aside . While Franczyk is on the record favoring a new stadium in the city , he would not support the removal of Perry 's tenants .
‚Äú Some people have lived there for 40 years , that is their home . Just because they might be of slightly less income does not mean that is not where their heart is , and that is where their neighborhood is . ‚Äù
The Pegulas have been saying very little about a new football stadium , but the predominant scenario would see the Cobblestone District built up‚Äìwith the arena , HarborCenter , the casino , Canalside and Labatt USA .
The expanded entertainment district would be capitalized on the construction of a new Bills football stadium , just a few blocks away , or possibly a new convention center .

Paris District High School 's junior girls volleyball team continued its dominant season Tuesday .
Playing at Pauline Johnson Collegiate against Assumption College in the opening game of the best-of-three Brant County high school championship series , the Panthers scored a 25-17 , 19-25 , 25-14 and 25-13 win against the Lions .
Coming into the final , Paris was undefeated in Brant County this season .
And , although the Panthers dropped a set in Game 1 , coach Sandy Beedham is pleased with her team 's play .
`` They 're a very patient team , '' said Beedham , whose team will look to clinch the championship in Game 2 on Thursday at PJC at 4 p.m ..
`` We 're very quiet and steady . We know if we take a loss ( of a set ) we can usually bounce back from it . That 's good to have in a junior team . ''
It 's clear from watching just a few minutes of a game that these Panthers are talented from top to bottom .
Beedham said she uses her entire roster , which is almost equal between students in Grades 9 and 10 . There 's a wide range between club players and those with little or no experienc .
The the team has come a long way , especially on its left side , but Beedham said she 's working with players on certain things .
`` Right now we 're working on calling our serve and they 're really hitting their spots , '' she said . `` That makes a big difference to be able to hit that spot .
`` And we 're really working with this team to swing to finish . At the first of the year we went into a few five ( set matches ) with teams because we tried to play their game , which is quick free ball .
`` Our team needs to smack the ball . ''
Paris proved early in Game 1 why it is the favourite .
In the opening set , the Panthers built leads of 7-1 , 12-3 and 17-7 . Assumption did catch its breath later in the set , getting to within five at 21-16 , but Paris finished things with a 4-1 run .
Even though the Lions got down 2-0 in the second set in the best-of-five match , this time they picked themselves up .
With Bella Restelli on the service line , Assumption would eventually take a 9-2 lead . But , as quickly as they built it , it got taken away as Nicole Sharpe served Paris all the way back into a tie at 9-9 .
With a great back row hit from Restelli and terrific defence and serving by Mya Chappell , the Lions went on a run and took a 20-10 advantage .
Good serving from the Panthers Amma Nolson put some pressure on the Lions but Assumption prevailed to even the match at 1-1 .
Following a second set that found Paris going back on balls and making some poor first passes , the Panthers picked things up and took a 4-1 lead in the third .
After grabbing a 15-9 advantage later in the set with some great hits from Leah Kruis and solid serves from Kianna Miller , PDHS saw its lead trimmed to 15-13 when Restelli scored several points from the service line .
Despite that brief jolt , that 's as close as the Lions would get as the Panthers prevailed 25-14 .
Paris did n't let up in the fourth set , going ahead 3-0 , 8-2 , 14-6 and 19-7 before wrapping things up .
Assumption coach Meghan Vickers liked the way her team played in the second set .
`` I think that set was one of the best sets we 've had against them , '' she said . `` It was very similar to the games we 've had when we 've played in tournaments .
`` When we 're moving , when we 're talking and communicating and fighting for every point , that made that set better .
`` The girls have to have constant positivity , clapping for every point , cheering for every point and shaking hands on every point . ''
Vickers said she thinks her team can rebound in Game 2 .
`` If we play like that second set on Thursday , I think we 're going to Friday , '' she said .
If necessary , Game 3 in the final is Friday at PJC at 4 p.m .

Not long after the Muhammadu Buhari administration came into power , youth restiveness in the Niger Delta led to a decline in oil production and the accompanying fall in the nation 's earnings from the sector which has remained the main stay of the economy . It was no surprise then that foreign reserves plummeted leading to a drastic fall in the value of the Naira against other major currencies especially the United States dollar . Distributing the limited foreign exchange among the critical sectors of the economy became a delicate balancing act on the part of the Central Bank of Nigeria ( CBN ) and , in particular the Governor , Mr Godwin Emefiele .
The situation posed a huge challenge to the management of the apex bank . The Governor himself was , literally , in the eye of the storm as demands for foreign exchange kept rising even as the supply side of the hard currency remained static at best . It was at this point that he decided to expand his mandate beyond monetary policy formulation and financial system stability into areas he hoped will diversify the economy so as to lessen the pressure . This included his foray into agriculture , agri-business and agri- processing . Through this policy , the Anchor Borrowers Scheme , for instance , that backed small holder rice growers without abandoning the large scale producers , came on stream and with it the rice revolution .
The idea was and still is to reduce , if not eliminate , rice importation that was a major drain on the scarce foreign exchange . Commerce also got a sharp cut from the Emefiele scalpel when he put 41 inessential items on the import prohibition list . They were not altogether banned from being imported . The policy thrust defined those items like took pick , apple and others in that category which have local substitution as not urgently needed as to receive official foreign exchange allocation . That decision , in particular , could only have been taken by a CBN governor willing to stand up to the courage of his convictions in a determined effort to manage a currency that was battling to hold its value . Of course , there were barbs from all sides but he stayed his course .
As this tasking battle to save the Naira progressed , its value vis-√†-vis other currencies took a near fatal beating as it went down to N520 to the US dollar no thanks to the unpatriotic activity of speculators most of whom resorted to round tripping that further did damage to the nation 's currency . Notwithstanding , Emefiele remained resolute in his determination to win the game against those who saw the scenario as lucrative and a lifetime opportunity to make the kill . His application of the most intricate modules available in monetary policy formulation and implementation came in sync with the federal government 's measures to calm frayed nerves in the Niger Delta using the carrot and the stick . It worked as daily production improved and foreign exchange supplies rebounded offering a breathing space and a chance to the CBN to confront the saboteurs head on in a real battle of wits .
While this was on , he was conscious of the effect of any measure to be applied on the economy . He carried the major stakeholders- deposit money banks ( DMBs ) and bureaux de exchange along in the drive to satisfy all demands for foreign exchange . Through this dexterity and display of skill and tact , he has been able to bring the exchange rate to what it is today N360 to the dollar , a huge revamping move that is unprecedented anywhere else in the world . It was a feat achieved by the Central Bank of Nigeria under Emefiele as a result of a painstaking study of the forex market in Nigeria and even globally .
Reports across markets indicate that the apex bank 's long-haul strategy is having a sustained positive result particularly in the areas of foreign exchange market and the external sector . The CBN 's management of the crisis situation and the eventual huge foreign exchange resource deployment to counter speculators in the Nigerian currency market is lifting the economy from recession as external reserves reaches a high of more than USD30.1 billion , indicating a new threshold in the external sector strategy .
It is pertinent to point out , in our opinion , that in fighting to save the local currency from speculative attacks , Emefiele adopted a policy strategy of funding the commercial banks with enough forex to cater for the request of customers to meet personal travelling allowance ( PTA ) , basic travelling allowance ( BTA ) , medicals and tuition fees . With a willingness , capability , and determination to meet forex demand in the market , in our view , the CBN is restoring the value , pride and integrity of the local currency . A miracle indeed .

LONDON : British police said on Wednesday ( Jul 4 ) that they suspected two people , found in a critical condition near the English city where a former Russian spy was poisoned earlier this year , may have been exposed to an unknown substance .
Police in Wiltshire , where ex-double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia were poisoned with a nerve agent in March , took the rare step of declaring a major incident after a man and a woman were found unconscious on Saturday in Amesbury .

The pair is now in hospital in a critical condition .
`` They are both currently receiving treatment for suspected exposure to an unknown substance , '' Wiltshire Police said in a statement . `` Based upon the number of casualties affected , it is not believed that there is a significant health risk to the wider public . ''
The pair , both in their 40s , were initially believed to have taken heroin or crack cocaine from a contaminated batch of drugs . They are being treated at Salisbury District Hospital , which remains open as usual , police said .
The Skripals spent weeks in a critical condition in the same hospital before slowly recovering and being discharged .

More than three days since the two people were found , tests are still being conducted to ascertain what substance made them ill .
Amesbury lies seven miles ( 11km ) to the north of Salisbury , where the Skripals were found slumped unconscious on a bench on Mar 4 .
Police said sites in both Amesbury and Salisbury that they believed the man and woman found in Amesbury had frequented would be cordoned off as a precaution .
A Public Health England ( PHE ) spokesman said there was not a significant risk to the wider public .
Britain blamed Russia for poisoning Skripal with Novichok nerve agent , the first known offensive use of such a nerve agent on European soil since World War Two .
Moscow denied any involvement and suggested Britain had carried out the attack to stoke anti-Russian hysteria .
Russia has said it does not have such nerve agents , did not develop Novichok , and President Vladimir Putin dismissed as nonsense the notion that Moscow would have poisoned Skripal and his 33-year-old daughter .
The attack prompted the biggest Western expulsion of Russian diplomats since the Cold War as allies in Europe and the United States sided with Prime Minister Theresa May 's view that Moscow was either responsible or had lost control of the nerve agent .
Moscow has hit back by expelling Western diplomats , questioning how Britain knows that Russia was responsible and offering its rival interpretations , including that it amounted to a plot by British secret services .

Next up for the Ventures ( 23-12-1 ) is a battle with Caro on Friday morning in the state semifinals at Michigan State University .
To advance to the quarterfinals , Foley overpowered Almont 11-0 for the regional title on Saturday . Richard ( 20-8 ) crushed Dundee 18-5 to earn its regional crown .
Justin Campbell started on the mound for the Ventures and went the distance . He struck out five batters , walked only one and allowed just five hits . At the plate he was 1-for-3 with an RBI and reached on an error .
¬ìYou get the same guy every single time you come out , said Ventures coach Greg Fettes of Campbell . ¬ìHe¬ís a competitor , he¬ís going to battle for you the kid¬ís a player.¬î
Also for Foley , Evan Finegan finished 2-for-3 with two RBIs and Mason Minzey was 1-for-3 with a pair of RBIs and a run scored .
Foley got on the board in the bottom of the first thanks to a Chase Gearing single that knocked in Max Stevenson and gave the squad a 1-0 lead .
Stevenson had reached with a single and stole second , which was one of nine Foley steals on Tuesday .
With the bases still loaded , Richard starting pitcher Matthew Silka got out of the inning with a line drive caught on the infield .
In the bottom of the third Silka struck out the Ventures¬í Alex Dixon with two outs and the bases loaded .
To load the bases that inning , Finegan singled , Gearing was hit by a pitch and Santos Guzman walked .
Richard filled the bases in the top of the fourth after Zach Swain singled and both Haydon Burke and Josh Tufts reached on errors .
With two outs , Campbell got Shawn Szpaichler to swing and miss at a 2-2 pitch and ended the threat .
Foley¬ís Payton Schuster kicked off the four-run fourth inning with a one-out single and Stevenson walked .
Minzey drove in Schuster with a single to put the Ventures up 2-0 . Minzey moved to second on the throw home and Stevenson made it to third .
Next up was Campbell , who hit a rocket back at the mound that hit Silka¬ís leg and went into the outfield . Stevenson easily scored from third and gave Foley a 3-0 advantage .
Yet another hard hit ball came back up the middle , this time off the bat of Finegan , and it allowed courtesy runners Benji Alderson and Jonathan Hubanks to cross the plate and gave Foley a commanding 5-0 lead .
In the bottom of the fifth , Evan Ludwick reached with a one-out single and then stole both second and third . Schuster drove him in with a double and gave the Ventures a six-run lead . A bad throw into the infield allowed Schuster to advance to third .
After a walk to Stevenson , a sacrifice fly from Minzey scored Schuster and made it a 7-0 game .
Stevenson stole second and third and came home after an error on a hard liner hit by Finegan .
Swain and Jac Lemieux singled for Richard in the sixth and Tufts was hit by a pitch , but the Pioneers were unable to push a run across and ultimately went on to the 8-0 defeat .
¬ìI¬ím definitely proud the season we had , ¬î said Pioneers coach Mike Magier . ¬ìI wish we had a better outcome today , obviously . They had their ace back and we threw three sophomores today .
¬ìIt¬ís good for the program , moving forward , I think it will help them get better for postseason play in the years to come.¬î
Richard¬ís Jacob Hanoian and Zach Loewengruber also had hits in Tuesday¬ís game .
On the mound , Silka pitched three and a third innings , while Burke and Frank Klamerus combined for the other two and two thirds innings .
The Ventures¬í semifinal game with Caro is set for 9 a.m. on Friday at MSU . The winner will play either Stevensville Lakeshore or Chelsea for the championship the following day at 2:30 p.m. , back at MSU .

It 's not every day that the Queen of England makes an announcement following the death of a public figure . Indeed , it 's relatively rare for her to make any public announcements at all . Because of this , a statement released in February 2018 left many curious ‚Äì and it was in connection with the death of an individual who was much-loved in the Christian community and beyond .
The man who had died was Pastor Billy Graham , who passed away due to natural causes on February 21 , 2018 . An individual who was frequently cited as being among the ‚Äú Ten Most Admired Men In The World , ‚Äù Graham preached to over 200 million people over the course of his lifetime . On the event of his death , many figures wasted no time in expressing their grief .

Those sending their condolences included the current President , Donald Trump , as well as his predecessor , Barack Obama . Both took to Twitter to praise the prominent evangelist . Steering clear of his often provocative approach , Trump wrote , ‚Äú The great Billy Graham is dead . There was nobody like him ! He will be missed by Christians and all religions . A very special man . ‚Äù

MONTREAL ‚Äî At first whiff , the traffic and grime of Montreal 's busy downtown may not seem like the best inspiration for a luxurious perfume , but Claude-Andre Hebert begs to differ .
In honour of the city 's 375th anniversary , the Montreal-based perfume maker has launched five scents , each inspired by a different area of the city .
One evokes the essence of bustling Ste-Catherine street , while others try to capture the romance of Old Montreal , the grandeur of old churches , or the scent of the grass on Mount Royal .
And how does one capture the scent of a city ? Hebert says it starts with a story .
‚Äú I always start with a blank page and write a story , and every word that 's important in the story is transformed into an ingredient , ‚Äù he said from behind the counter of his St-Denis street boutique .
For the scent inspired by Old Montreal , Hebert said he created a ‚Äú vintage ‚Äù perfume with hints of cardamom and cinnamon that brings to mind velvet and lace , the dust of the city streets and the smell of the nearby St-Lawrence river .
The floral-scented ‚Äú Metropole ‚Äù incorporates tobacco and hops -- a nod to downtown nightlife -- while the perfume named after Mount Royal includes pine and hints of the incense that wafts over from nearby St-Joseph 's Oratory .
Hebert , 47 , said he started his own line in 2002 after realizing that most perfume makers focus more on ingredients than on inspiration .
‚Äú They talk about the top note , the base note , the patchouli ... it 's like a recipe ‚Äù said Hebert , who previously worked for labels that include Aramis and Thierry Mugler . ‚Äú For me a perfume is much more than that . ‚Äù
Hebert orders his ingredients from a company in Grasse , France .
Once they arrive they are mixed with corn alcohol to create a ratio of 20 % raw materials , 80 % alcohol and about 1 % water .
He says he eschews chemicals when possible , opting for 95 % natural ingredients . The perfumes then sit for about a month before they hit the shelves .
The finished product sells for $ 185 for 100 ml -- a testament to the cost of the ingredients and the steps involved in the process .
But Canadians do n't seem to be put off by the price of what is undeniably a luxury purchase .
Although there are no precise Canadian sales figures , the fragrance industry is estimated to have grown 4 % to 5 % in 2016 , according to the Canadian Cosmetic , Toiletry and Fragrance Association ( CCTFA ) .
So-called niche fragrances like the ones Hebert sells -- ones available through a limited number of channels -- are a small but growing category in that market .
Hebert says scents are important because they can help create or trigger memories and give people a little boost when they want to feel sexier or more energized .
‚Äú If all your chakras are perfect you probably do n't need perfume , ‚Äù he said . ‚Äú But the perfumes are there if you need a little touch , a little push . ‚Äù

Yet another spinoff of The Conjuring franchise has been put into development . Filmmaker James Wan 's 2013 horror film scored wildly positive reviews and set him on a path to go and direct films like Furious 7 and the now-filming Aquaman , but it also spawned a franchise . Wan returned to helm The Conjuring 2 , but New Line Cinema produced a spinoff of the first film called Annabelle in 2014 , with a sequel to that film called Annabelle : Creation hitting theaters later this year . Then The Conjuring 2 warranted its own spinoff , The Nun , which hits theaters in 2018 , and now a second spinoff from The Conjuring 2 is in the works .
Per THR , Mike Van Waes has been hired to pen the script for The Crooked Man based on a story by Wan . The character first appeared in The Conjuring 2 during a pretty terrifying sequence involving a zoetrope toy . The character is based on an English nursery rhyme , but made for a memorable horror figure in the context of The Conjuring 2 .
It 'll be interesting to see how The Crooked Man is fleshed out as a full feature film . The Nun is based on the main villain of The Conjuring 2 , but the nun character was n't even added to the film until post-production‚ÄîWan decided the original design for the antagonist was n't scary enough , and developed a new design and backstory for the nun .
No release date is yet set , but if we 're following the format of one Conjuring movie per year , The Crooked Man will likely hit theaters in 2019 .
TOKYO : Pregnant women struggling to bag a seat on the famously packed Tokyo subway could find their salvation in a new app connecting them with nearby passengers willing to give up their coveted perch .
The digital match-making app being trialled this week on the metro aims to overcome two problems especially prevalent in Japan : passengers generally have their nose buried in their phones and talking is strictly frowned upon .
The service allows a pregnant woman to send a message when she wants a seat .
The app will then look for generous pre-registered users who have said they are willing to give up their seats .
If there is a match , the pregnant woman gets a seat map on her smartphone screen showing her partner 's location .
The exchange can be made without giving personal information to each other .

Printing and IT firm Dai Nippon has been testing the service this week on one of the key subway lines in conjunction with Tokyo Metro and the Line messaging app company .
`` This may be particular to Japan but some people hesitate to speak to a person who may need a seat , '' said a spokeswoman at Dai Nippon Printing involved in the project .
`` Many people are also looking at smartphone screens and do not always realise quickly that someone in need is standing nearby , '' said the official , who declined to be named .
`` We try to take advantage of the situation . ''
It is yet to be decided when the service will be rolled out but the companies also hope to expand assistance to elderly and disabled people .
Japan has one of the world 's lowest birth rates and authorities are trying out several policies to encourage people to have more children .
Tokyo : Associations representing atomic bomb survivors in Japan criticised on Saturday a change in the policy of the US which advocates modernising its atomic arsenal and increasing its launch capacity .
Toshiyuki Mimaki of the Japan Confederation of A-and H-Bomb Sufferers Organisations expressed anger over the change in Washington 's strategy , saying it posed an obstacle to global denuclearisation , reported Japan 's state broadcaster NHK .
Mimaki said `` if the President of a global power such as the US wanted to increase and modernize its nuclear capacities , the survivors of the atomic bombings in Japan will never see a world without nuclear weapons '' .
Mimaki , a survivor of the nuclear bombing by the US on Hiroshima on 6 August , 1945 , said that these weapons do not make the world a safer place and should never be used .
Koichi Kawano , leader of Hibakuren , a survivor group based in Nagasaki ‚Äî which suffered a nuclear attack on 9 August , 1945 ‚Äî said the announcement poured cold water on the historic UN treaty to ban nuclear weapons , adopted last year by over 120 countries .
Kawano warned that the new US strategy , which seeks to develop smaller nuclear arms , could lower the bar for the use of such weapons and raise the likelihood of nuclear war .
He also urged the Japanese government to utilise the US presence in Japan to intensify its diplomatic efforts to prevent such a scenario .
However , Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Kono in a statement welcomed Washington 's move , saying it showed the determination of the US to ensure the effectiveness of dissuasion .
The Nuclear Posture Review of the US , presented on Friday by the Trump administration is in contrast the one in 2010 by then-President Barack Obama ( 2009-2017 ) , who sought a reduction in the nuclear arsenal .
Berlin : Michy Batshuayi scored twice on his Borussia Dortmund debut in Friday 's 3-2 Bundesliga win at bottom side Cologne ‚Äî just two days after signing on loan from Chelsea .
Head coach Peter Stoeger , who was sacked by Cologne in December , threw the Belgian striker in at the deep end to replace Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang .
Dortmund sold their top-scorer to Arsenal for ¬£56 million , then signed Batshuayi hours later than cover until May .
`` I am very happy , but the most important thing was the win , '' Batshuayi told Eurosport .
`` It 's my first match , it was always going to be difficult .
`` I could have scored more but the most important is the win and the three points .
`` My goal with Dortmund is to keep winning , finishing as high as possible to play in the Champions League next season . ''
Having already scored 12 goals for Chelsea this season , Batshuayi scored 35 minutes into his Bundesliga debut when he fired home a cross .
Cologne equalised with an hour gone , but the 24-year-old Batshuayi showed ice-cool finishing to restore the lead less than two minutes later .
He could have finished with a hat-trick having put the ball in the net just before the break , but the video assistant referee ( VAR ) spotted he was offside .
Cologne levelled for the second time when Jorge Mere headed home , but Batshuayi provided the final pass for Andre Schuerrle to hit the winner .
The win broke Dortmund 's run of three draws .
It lifts them to second in the table , level on 34 points with Bayer Leverkusen and Schalke who play on Saturday , behind leaders Bayern Munich .
The defeat ends Cologne 's four-match unbeaten run which yielded 10 points to boost survival hopes .
Batshuayi grabbed his first goal when Dortmund left-back Jeremy Toljan fired a cross into the box for the Belgian striker to fire home .
The pair combined again just before the break when Batshuayi again tapped home , but the goal was ruled offside by the VAR .
It was 1-0 at the break , but Cologne drew level on 60 minutes when second-half replacement midfielder Simon Zoller finished off a counter-attack .
However , Dortmund replied almost immediately .
Christian Pulisic headed down a long ball and Batshuayi robbed Cologne defender Dominique Heintz before firing home from a tight angle .
Cologne equalised again on 69 minutes when Mere headed home from a corner .
Schuerrle claimed his first league goal for 11 months when Batshuayi spotted the Germany winger free on the right and he smashed home the winner .
Swiss centre-back Manuel Akanji , who cost ‚Ç¨21.5 million from Basel last month , made his Dortmund debut in the dying stages off the bench .

Alton Towers owner Merlin Entertainments ( LSE : MERL ) was the FTSE 100 's top performing stock in trading yesterday , rising almost 3.5 % . The reason ? It would appear that the company is keen to purchase parts of US theme park giant SeaWorld , the only snag being the latter 's preference for an outright sale .
This news is n't exactly unexpected , particularly as Merlin did hint at purchasing SeaWorld 's African-inspired Busch Gardens theme park when announcing its interim results back in August . Nevertheless , a deal now seems particularly opportunistic given that the Florida-based marine park operator 's shares have lost a quarter of their value so far this year and hit an all-time low of just over $ 11 a couple of months ago . To give some perspective , the stock changed hands for nearly $ 40 a shot four years ago before accusations were made about the way in which the company treated the whales in its parks and attendance figures began to dwindle .
This seems an understandable move by Merlin , especially as it 's already the world 's largest aquarium operator . Even if a deal does n't materialise , I still think there are a number of reasons for investors to consider adding the ¬£4.7bn cap to their portfolios .
While its elephant-like nature means its share price wo n't exactly gallop anytime soon , an expected 16 % rise in earnings per share in the next financial year leaves it trading at 19 times forecast earnings . That 's not screamingly cheap but nor is it ludicrously expensive for a business with an ambitious international growth strategy . Indeed , so geographically diversified are the company 's assets , I believe it could be a good stock to hold as we approach our EU departure . Factor-in consistently high operating margins and decent free cash flow and there are surely far worse picks in the market 's top tier .
Strike it rich
Those with more risk appetite might wish to take a closer look at ¬£276m cap Hollywood Bowl ( LSE : BOWL ) . Shares rose in early trading this morning after an encouraging year-end trading update from the Hemel Hempstead-based firm .
Since coming to the market last September , the UK 's largest ten-pin bowling operator said that it had met its goals of expanding its sites , refurbishing those already in its possession and rebranding those taken over from peer Bowlplex . This has led to ‚Äú strong financial and operational performance ‚Äù which is now expected to be ‚Äú marginally ahead ‚Äù of previous expectations . Revenue growth of 10 % was seen in H2 compared to the same period in 2016 , with like-for-like growth for the whole year now predicted to come in at 3.5 % .
It gets even better for holders of the stock . Building on hints made in its half-year trading update and thanks to its cash generative nature , the company reiterated its intention to return cash to investors in the form of a special dividend at some point in the future . More news on this is expected when full-year results are confirmed in December .
At a time when many growth stocks are starting to look frothy , it 's pleasing to note that shares in Hollywood Bowl still look reasonably priced , trading as they are at 17 times earnings . Assuming analyst earnings projections for the next financial year are hit , this falls to just 15 times earnings for 2018/19 .
While it would be a mistake to forget that its business model can be easily replicated , Hollywood Bowl remains a promising growth play .
BEIRUT : An earthquake hit western Iran on Monday , the region where an earthquake last month killed at least 530 people , state media reported .
The centre of the quake was near the town of Ezgele , but tremors were also felt in Kermanshah , the largest city in the area .
Iranian state media said the quake was a magnitude 6.0 . The U.S. Geological Survey reported it was 5.4 . Last month 's quake was a magnitude 7.3 .
President Hassan Rouhani highlighted his government 's efforts in bringing aid and temporary housing to the victims of last month 's quake . Hardline rivals said the government response was not quick enough or adequate .
No reports of deaths or injuries have come in , the governor of Kermanshah province said , according to state media .

An ISIS gunman who murdered 39 people in a Turkish nightclub sprayed the crowd with 180 bullets during the seven-minute ordeal .
The group claimed responsibility this morning after issuing a statement praising its 'heroic soldier ' for the attack .
Turkish media now say the gunman , who is still on the run from authorities , used as many as 180 bullets - firing almost every two seconds .
At least 600 people were inside the building at the time with almost 40 killed and another 70 injured in the ambush .
ISIS claim responsibility for slaughter of 39 clubbers in Turkish nightclub saying 'heroic soldier ' carried out attack

The IS statement , as revealed by Reuters , read : ‚Äú In continuation of the blessed operations that Islamic State is conducting against the protector of the cross , Turkey , a heroic soldier of the caliphate struck one of the most famous nightclubs where the Christians celebrate their apostate holiday . ‚Äù
The gunman is understood to have arrived at the club by taxi , rushed through the entrance carrying a long-barrelled gun he had taken from the boot of the car and began firing indescriminantly .
CCTV footage of the man showed him sneaking around the carnage after launching his attack .

Another taxi is then believed to have picked him up as he escaped the police .
Police believe he was a ‚Äú well-trained professional with experience of war ‚Äù , it is claimed .
Reports suggest they have come to the conclusion after considering the killer 's use of a Kalashnikov , a heavy-duty weapon , and fired it from the waist , aiming it towards the upper body of his victims for maximum casualties .

They also say he spoke in ‚Äú broken ‚Äù Turkish and was wearing a green shirt , dark pants and black boots .
He was said to be aged around 25-years-old and may be from East Turkestan .

Red Sox pitcher returns to field after child undergoes surgery
Boston Red Sox pitcher Craig Kimbrel returned to spring training nearly three weeks after his infant daughter had heart surgery .
WINK News sportscaster Andrew Keesee shared his journey back to the mound .

Sergio Ramos criticised referee Ricardo de Burgos Bengoetxea for sending off Cristiano Ronaldo as Real Madrid secured a 3-1 win over Barcelona in the first leg of the Supercopa de Espana at the Nou Camp .
Substitute Ronaldo restored Real 's lead with a brilliant effort from range 10 minutes from time , but was sent off two minutes later after picking up a second yellow card for diving after going down under pressure from Samuel Umtiti .
To compound matters , the Portugal forward - linked with a move away from the Bernabeu this summer - then pushed De Burgos Bengoetxea after being shown a red card .
Gerard Pique 's own goal had put Real ahead after a low-key first half , but in a frantic finish Lionel Messi equalised from the spot before Ronaldo struck , with Marco Asensio grabbing a last-minute third for the 10 men .
Real skipper Ramos said of the second booking , in quotes reported by Marca : `` I was far away , but I think it was a piece of play in which ( Ronaldo ) lost his balance , rather than feigning anything .
`` It could be appealed . Sending off a key player with 10 minutes remaining of a Clasico in which we 've given our all is something which needs to be evaluated and thought about . ''
Barcelona 's penalty was awarded after Luis Suarez was brought down by goalkeeper Keylor Navas , and Ramos also took issue with that decision .
`` In no moment was it a penalty , '' the Los Blancos defender added .
`` I will need to watch it and evaluate it because I do n't think the referee would blow for an action in which there was nothing there , knowing that he could be mistaken .
`` My feeling was that it was n't ( a penalty ) . ''
Barcelona boss Ernesto Valverde insisted the tie was not over ahead of Wednesday 's second leg at the Bernabeu .
He told Bar√ßa 's website : `` We have to look ahead as there is still the second leg to come . Even though they will be favourites , the game is still there to be played .
`` It was a game in which we had some good moments and in which we were caught out on the counter by two great goals .
`` We had chances in their area and I think we were closer to scoring than they were but when you do that you can switch off against Real Madrid .
`` You never like losing , even less so against Madrid , but aside from the blow of the defeat there are things that we can take from the game . ''
U.S. President Donald Trump on Tuesday said he wants to withdraw American troops from Syria `` relatively soon '' but not before their mission is completed , adding that negotiations over the crisis there should be part of a larger deal regarding Iran .
`` We want to come home . We 'll be coming home . But we want to leave a strong and lasting footprint , and that was a very big part of our discussion , '' Trump said at a joint news conference with French President Emmanuel Macron at the White House .
‚Äú An incomprehensible failure. ‚Äù Those were the words used to describe the federal government 's handling of the Phoenix pay system .
They were n't words spoken by their partisan opponents in the House of Commons . No , they came from Auditor General Michael Ferguson .
It 's not the type of language he regularly uses in his regular reports that hone in on specific deficiencies in government . This is an exceptional circumstance .
As Mark Bonokoski explained in a recent column : ‚Äú It was the Harper Conservatives who projected Phoenix would save $ 70 million a year by requiring fewer bodies , but it was the Trudeau crowd who determined the time was right to go live .
Because of this , there were cases of ‚Äú public servants being under-paid , over-paid , or not paid at all , with the tab to fix the glitch now honing in on $ 1.2 billion . ‚Äù
These were workers from all pay scales . Stories have emerged over the past year of public servants taking out loans and going into debt to simply pay the rent or buy groceries . It 's just not right .
What could lead to such a boondoggle ? It 's easy , concluded Ferguson . There was nobody keeping watch .
‚Äú Overall , we found that there was no oversight of the Phoenix project , which allowed Phoenix executives to implement the system even though they knew it had significant problems , ‚Äù reads the executive summary from the Office of the Auditor General of Canada .
No oversight ? It 's a crazy notion given that there are public servants , contractors and politicians all thrown into the mix here . But none of them stepped forward to press pause on this project before it went live .
The report notes that ‚Äú several departments and agencies , along with third-party assessments , identified significant problems with the system . Phoenix executives did not understand the importance of these warnings and went ahead with implementing Phoenix. ‚Äù It 's a damning conclusion .
Ferguson recommends things like actually testing such systems on one or two departments before the whole thing goes live .
But there 's a bigger problem . ‚Äú There 's something in the culture that makes people believe they ca n't bring forward those problems , ‚Äù Ferguson told the media .
The senior levels of the public service need to work to change this culture if they 're committed to delivering excellence for Canadians .
BEIJING : Heavy smog that blanketed parts of China at the weekend cleared somewhat on Monday , with flights in Beijing back to normal , but it was likely only to be a brief respite with more choking smog expected to return to the wintry north within 24 hours .
Weather forecasts on Monday showed the smog would return to Beijing and nearby Tianjin city from Tuesday . It was expected to persist until Thursday in Hebei , the heavily industrialised province that surrounds the capital , and Henan and Shandong provinces as the region battles freezing temperatures .
Authorities have been issuing smog alerts across the north since mid-December , prompting orders for hundreds of factories to scale back production or close outright and for restrictions on motorists to cut emissions .
Pollution alerts are common in northern China , especially during winter when energy demand , much of it met by coal , soars .
A pollution index that measures the average concentration of small breathable particles , known as PM2.5 , dropped to just over 100 micrograms per cubic metre in Beijing early on Monday from more than 500 on Sunday night .
The safe recommended level of PM2.5 is 10 micrograms per cubic metre , according to the World Health Organization .
A customer service staff member at the Beijing Capital International Airport said flights were returning to normal . Smog on Sunday caused hundreds of flights to be cancelled and highways to shut , disrupting the first day of the New Year holiday .
On Monday , the Beijing government maintained its orange alert for heavy pollution and a ban on heavy-duty construction trucks from using the roads .
An orange alert is the second-highest level in a four-tier pollution warning system adopted by Beijing when China , worried that its heavy industrial past was tarnishing its global reputation and holding back development , declared a `` war on pollution '' in 2014 .
Despite that declaration , public anger is mounting about pollution and what many Chinese sees as government talk , but little action , to end it . That anger has occasionally spilled over into protests .
Late on Sunday , the Ministry of Environmental Protection said 62 northern cities had issued yellow , orange or red alerts .
Some highways to Beijing and Tianjin were re-opened as motorists headed home at the end of the long weekend , state television reported later on Monday .
But 20 highways remained closed in Shandon province , as heavy smog persisted .
State television also reported that some factories in Hebei province 's heavy industry hub of Tangshan , including a coal-fired power plant of Datang Power International , and several steel mills , were found to be violating the curb on operations .
The latest bout of air pollution began on Friday . China has struggled to tackle the problem effectively after decades of breakneck economic growth , much of it based on heavy industry and the coal-fired power sector .

In the 1800s , the sport truly began to take shape in Eastern Canada . By the late 19th century , the game had grown popular in the United States . American Malcolm Greene Chace became interested in the game and assembled a group of players from various universities . In 1896 , a team from Yale , which included Chace , faced Johns Hopkins University in the first college hockey game . Soon , professional leagues formed in North America .

Dimitrov and Nadal meets at the net after their encounter in Melbourne this year | Photo : Michael Dodge/Getty Images AsiaPac
Rafael Nadal and Grigor Dimitrov face off in what could be a scintillating semifinal encounter at the China Open as the Bulgarian looks to pull off the upset in their tenth meeting of their careers .
Nadal has had an incredible season thus far , reaching three Major finals and extending his Grand Slam haul to 16 , while Dimitrov reentered the top-10 with some consistent results which allowed him to reclaim his status of being a contender at the major tournaments . They face off for the second time this year having met at the start of the year in Melbourne , and the enthusiastic fans in Beijing will have a good show to watch as the two battle tomorrow afternoon at the National Tennis Stadium .
Nadal 's path to the semifinals
Nadal had the worst possible draw despite being the top seed as he was drawn to face the dangerous Frenchman Lucas Pouille , the player who sent him crashing out of the US Open last year . Knowing that it was a tough challenge , Nadal lived up to the occasion and managed to edge through in the encounter , saving two match points to triumph in the first-round thriller .
Going against Russian talent Karen Khachanov , Nadal surprisingly did not face any troubles and strolled to the comfortable 6-3 , 6-3 win in just under 90 minutes of play , making his 12th quarterfinal appearance of the year . He then exacted revenge for his Laver Cup loss with an impressive straight-sets win over the big-serving John Isner , prevailing in the tight affair which saw him fend off all three break points he faced in the encounter .

Dimitrov 's path to the semifinals
Dimitrov had a tricky opener as he was drawn to face the in-form Damir Dzumhur in the first round , with the Bosnian rattling off 25 wins in his last 31 matches . Despite a slight hiccup in the second set , the Bulgarian was able to claim the win in three sets to overcome his slow start to the tournament .
A blockbuster second-round meeting with wildcard and 2009 US Open champion Juan Martin del Potro followed as the match-up definitely lived up to the hype it received , with Dimitrov prevailing in the high-quality encounter after exactly two hours of play .
The world number eight was able to ride on his momentum and prevailed in a tight quarterfinal clash against fifth seed Roberto Bautista Agut , coming back from an early deficit in the final set to do so , setting up a meeting with Nadal in Beijing for the second consecutive year .

Match Analysis
Scheduled third at the National Tennis Stadium , this encounter between Nadal and Dimitrov will be a top-notch battle between a counterpuncher and an aggressive player . Both players excel with their playing styles and their world-class tennis was what allowed them to enter the world 's top 10 , especially for Nadal and his 16 Grand Slam titles .
Dubbed as the ‚Äú baby Federer ‚Äù in the younger days of his career , Dimitrov adopts a playing style similar to Nadal 's biggest rival of his life as he is a very aggressive player looking to dictate play throughout the match . He would look to use his solid groundstrokes and powerful serves and overpower the defensive-minded Nadal , who could be aggressive at times .

His famous one-handed backhand should also be a weapon , especially the slices on it , but Nadal deals extremely well with those slices and the Bulgarian will be looking to utilize his consistent forehands more often . Dimitrov would have to lessen the number of unforced errors at the baseline as Nadal is an incredible baseliner who could possibly return any balls that lands on his side of the court .
Nadal deals well with the pace of Dimitrov 's shots , as seen in their past meetings . The Spaniard is one of the best returners in the game and his returning position in the back of the court would allow him to better anticipate the direction of the serve , but it could also pose a danger as his opponent would be able to throw in a drop shot .
Nadal 's forehand is one of his most famous shots , and if the match were to be a physical one , the French Open and US Open champion will have the edge . Nadal is an excellent defender , and Dimitrov will definitely find it a daunting task to be hitting consecutive winners past the 16-time Grand Slam champion , and thus the Spaniard could come up with some impressive shots to turn defense into offense , turning the point into his advantage .

Head-to-Head
Nadal and Dimitrov had met for a total of nine times in the past , with the Spaniard leading their lopsided head-to-head 8-1 . Their most notable meeting came at this year 's Australian Open , where Nadal triumphed in a five set thriller . It was a semifinal encounter with Nadal playing for his first Major final since 2014 and Dimitrov aiming to reach his first ever Grand Slam final . Dimitrov 's only win , coincidentally , came at the China Open last year and the Bulgarian triumphed with a 6-2 , 6-4 scoreline .
Match Prediction : [ 1 ] Rafael Nadal d. [ 3 ] Grigor Dimitrov in three sets
Although much of moviegoers ' attention this April is focused on the impending release of Avengers : Infinity War , the Marvel extravaganza is not the only film hitting theaters this month . There are loads of other movies being released that are hoping to cater to those who are uninterested in the superhero epic , and one of them is the thriller Traffik . The film has a horrifying story that revolves around the sex trafficking industry , as it follows an innocent couple who become caught up in a human trafficking ring . It 's certainly scary , but is Traffik a true story ?
The film itself is not a true story , but it was inspired by true events . The movie 's plot sees a couple ( Paula Patton , who 's also a producer , and Omar Epps ) go on a road trip , where they run into a motorcycle gang at a gas station . The gang have a woman with them who sneaks a cell phone into the purse of Patton 's character in the bathroom . This leads to the gang , who are connected to a sex trafficking ring , to track down the phone and terrorize the innocent couple . This event itself is entirely fictional , and was written by director Deon Taylor , but the filmmaker drew inspiration from real life sex trafficking incidents near his home in Northern California .

Taylor , who lives in Placer County with his wife Roxanne Avent ( a producer on the film ) and their 13-year-old daughter , revealed a scary experience that led to his idea for the film in an interview with the Los Angeles Times . `` We started getting emails about kids being trafficked in our city and at the mall , '' Taylor told the L.A. Times ' Sonaiya Kelley . `` I remember thinking , 'Well , black people do n't get trafficked so we 're cool . '' Taylor ‚Äî who is black ‚Äî then learned that around 40 percent of trafficking victims are African American , and quickly changed his thinking . `` And as I realized just how dumb my thought was , I began to realize just how big the epidemic was for kids being trafficked all over the world domestically , '' he said .
Not only was Taylor inspired by real life sex trafficking crimes , but his film ended up being closer to reality than even he envisioned . The pivotal gas station in the movie is a real gas station in Placer County , and while filming there , Taylor learned of a sex trafficking bust that had recently taken place just up the road . According to the L.A. Times , a local police officer approached Taylor while he was filming at the gas station and told him that 15 miles down the road they had recently discovered 40 young women and girls hidden under a house in a set up Taylor compared to Silence of the Lambs .

Placer County is currently a major epicenter for the human trafficking epidemic . Over 40 cases involving either human trafficking directly or the related crimes of pimping , prostitution , and pandering were investigated in the county in 2017 , according to local newspaper The Loomis News , which also lists nearby Sacramento County as another hub for traffickers . In Dec. 2017 , a sting of a suspected human trafficking ring in bordering El Dorado County led to 14 arrests , according to the Sacramento Bee .
Traffick may not be a true story per se , but it 's shining a light on a growing problem in the United States , and especially in Northern California where the film was shot . Human trafficking is a blight on society that needs to be eradicated , and Traffick is hoping to educate people on the seriousness of the threat .
If you believe you have some information on a sex trafficking crime , you can visit the National Trafficking Hotline online or call them at 1-888-373-7888 .
Police have appealed for help to track down a young man who went missing earlier today .
Officers in Peterlee have issued a photo of Declan Freeman as they try to track him down .
They say they are concerned for his welfare .
Declan , who lives in Peterlee , was last seen at around 11.30am in the Beverley Way area of the town .
The 18-year-old is around 5ft 5in in height was wearing black clothing .
Anyone who has seen him is asked to call Durham Constabulary on 101 .

Argentina 's business-friendly President Mauricio Macri 's preferred candidate led a closely watched Senate primary race on Sunday , in what could be a surprise win over populist former President Cristina Fernandez in Buenos Aires province .
BUENOS AIRES : Argentina 's former populist leader Cristina Fernandez and business-friendly President Mauricio Macri 's preferred candidate were nearly tied in a closely watched Senate primary on Sunday , with few votes left to be counted .
With 87.97 percent of polling stations counted , Macri 's coalition led by former education minister Esteban Bullrich had 34.31 percent of votes compared with 33.98 percent for Fernandez 's list in Buenos Aires province .
Bullrich 's lead narrowed significantly late in the count in a hotly contested battle to represent the province that is home to nearly 40 percent of Argentina 's electorate .
Fernandez had been expected to win by several percentage points according to the final polls last week , causing investors to fear a comeback in Congress could pave the way to her running for president in 2019 and ending Macri 's reform agenda .
The compulsory primary vote essentially serves as a detailed poll ahead of the Oct. 22 election for one third of the Senate and half the lower house of Congress , because no major candidates are being challenged from within their own parties .

Rising government and public hostility towards the lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender ( LGBT ) community in Indonesia is threatening the battle against AIDS in the world 's largest Muslim-majority country , activists and an official said .
JAKARTA : Rising government and public hostility towards the lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender ( LGBT ) community in Indonesia is threatening the battle against AIDS in the world 's largest Muslim-majority country , activists and an official said .
Homosexuality is not regulated by law in Indonesia , except in the conservative province of Aceh , but the country has seen an increase in raids targeting LGBT people , which have forced many members of the community underground .

The group Human Rights Watch ( HRW ) said this week hostility was making it harder for the LGBT community to get access to public health programmes , putting people at greater risk of contracting the human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) , which causes AIDS .
`` The Indonesian government should recognise that its role in abuses against LGBT people is seriously compromising the country 's response to HIV , '' said Kyle Knight , LGBT rights researcher at HRW and author of the report .
`` One particularly troubling aspect of the anti-LGBT panic is that public health outreach to such populations has become far more difficult , making wider spread of the disease more likely , '' the rights group said .
The prevalence rate of HIV among gay men in Indonesia has jumped from 8.5 percent in 2011 to 25 percent in 2015 , it said .

Indonesia recorded 46,357 new HIV infections in 2017 , with nearly a quarter of those among men who have sex with other men , according to government and UNAIDS data . Other groups included sex workers and intravenous drug users .
A senior health official said the increasing hostility to the LGBT community was disrupting the relations between health workers and people who need their help .
`` For a long time , health workers were able to meet these groups in certain places , '' Dr Windra Waworuntu , director general of infectious diseases at the health ministry , said on Wednesday .
`` But with the anti-LGBT feeling now , health workers find it difficult to reach them . It 's similar to when red-light districts are broken up and health workers have difficulty in reaching sex workers . ''
A spokesman for President Joko Widodo declined to comment when asked about rising anti-LGBT sentiment among the government and public but senior government officials have called for gay rights advocacy to be restricted .
Indonesia 's parliament looks set to criminalise same-sex relations , something that Islamist groups have long pressed for , while police have stood by while vigilantes have stormed `` gay sex parties '' .
Police have also stepped up raids on gatherings at spas and hostels , charging some people with violating strict pornography laws .
In 2016 , Vice President Jusuf Kalla asked the U.N. Development Programme to stop US $ 8 million of funding for LGBT-related programmes in Indonesia .
This year , a survey found that nearly 90 percent of Indonesians who understand the term `` LGBT '' felt threatened by the community , whiles the Indonesian Psychiatric Association and the Health Ministry stated in internal documents seen by Reuters that being LGBT was a mental illness .

Walmart is offering its employees a new perk : affordable access to a college degree .
America 's largest private employer , which in the past has helped its workers get their high school or equivalency degree , hopes the new benefit will help it recruit and retain higher quality entry-level employees in a tight U.S. labor market .
The company is teaming up with Denver-based startup Guild Education to offer employees the chance to obtain a bachelor 's degree in business or supply-chain management . It will cost a dollar a day at one of three non-profit universities with online programs that have had success working with adult learners : the University of Florida , Brandman University and Bellevue University . It plans to eventually expand to more types of degrees .
It will also offer college-prep classes for workers who need extra help . Walmart is subsidizing the cost of tuition , books and fees , eliminating the need for student loans .
Both full-time and part-time workers who have been with the company at least 90 days will be able to qualify , Walmart said . About 68,000 of Walmart 's 1.4 million U.S. employees are expected to enroll in the first five years , based on interest from its workers , said Julie Murphy , executive vice president of people at Bentonville , Arkansas-based Walmart .
The move underscores how retailers and restaurant chains are under increasing pressure to improve the skills of their entry-level workers at a time when their jobs are getting more complicated due to the rise of online shopping , steeper competition from Amazon and more demanding shoppers .
The partnership with Guild Education , which was founded in 2015 , goes beyond Walmart 's current program covering the cost of workers and eligible family members for earning a high school diploma or GED equivalent . The company also grooms managers at its Walmart Training Academy , and has a career program for entry level workers .
Guild Education works with other national chains , including Chipotle Mexican Grill , Taco Bell and Lowe 's , on their employee education programs . But Rachel Carlson , CEO and co-founder of Guild Education , says its partnership with Walmart is unique in several ways , including its low upfront costs .
Walmart 's move puts it in the league of Starbucks , which three years ago began offering four years of tuition for an online college degree from Arizona State University .

SEOUL : Hyundai Motor and affiliate Kia Motors on Monday forecast global sales to rebound in 2017 by a stronger-than-expected 5 percent , after posting their first annual sales fall in nearly two decades last year .
Sales could get a lift this year with emerging markets such as Russia stabilising , and with Hyundai and Kia Motors gearing up to boost supply to the United States and China , analysts said .
But margins could come under pressure as the South Korean duo - which together rank fifth in global sales - plan to add capacity in China and Mexico , just as many analysts expect those markets and the United States to slow .
`` With the global economy continuing its low growth , trade protectionism spreading and competition intensifying in the automobile industry , uncertainty is growing more than ever , '' Hyundai Motor Group Chairman Chung Mong-koo said in his New Year message to employees .
The 78-year-old chief said the automakers will launch more than 10 new models every year , including a new SUV for advanced markets and a Genesis G70 sedan this year .
The projected 5 percent rise in global sales for 2017 to 8.25 million vehicles easily beats the 1.9 percent rise forecast earlier by Hyundai Motor Group 's own think-tank .
`` The 2017 goal is slightly higher than my projection , '' said Ko Tae-bong , an auto analyst at Hi Investment & Securities .

Hyundai Motor likely clocked its fourth straight annual profit decline in 2016 . Sales were hit by its sedan-heavy line-up , which meant it missed a boom in SUV demand , and sluggish emerging markets .
Hyundai Motor sold 4.86 million vehicles compared with its target of 5.01 million last year . Kia Motors sold 3.02 million vehicles , shy of its goal of 3.12 million .
Hyundai Motor is now targeting 2017 global sales of 5.08 million vehicles , while its smaller affiliate set its goal at 3.17 million vehicles .
Kia Motors Vice Chairman Lee Hyong-keun warned of tough competition in the year ahead .
`` Rivals are expected to launch a full-blown assault based on their cost competitiveness , '' he said in a speech to employees .
Hyundai Motor shares ended up 2.7 percent on Monday and Kia Motors stocks were up 0.6 percent in a flat wider market .
Hyundai Motor shares fell for a third straight year in 2016 , down 2 percent , while Kia Motors was the worst-performing stock among major carmakers with a 25 percent slump .
Executives paid the price for Hyundai Motor 's rough year . The automaker 's top U.S. executive resigned and the South Korea sales chief and China head were replaced .

As lawmakers in the nation 's capital struggle with how to replace the Affordable Care Act , a greater number of insurance companies are leaving the marketplace within state marketplaces around the country , including here in Washington State .
Last week was the filing deadline for insurance companies who intend to offer coverage in Washington State when open enrollment through the Healthplanfinder exchange begins later this year . In all , eleven companies registered to offer a total of 71 plans .
Some rural areas however , found that no providers stepped forward to offer coverage , including both Klickitat and Grays Harbour Counties .
Residents living in Chelan and Douglas Counties will only have a single company to choose from , and that lack of competition is almost certain to see premiums increase and the scope of coverage for many to decrease .
State Senator and Executive Director of the North Central Washington Accountable Communities of Health Linda Evans-Parlette tells KOHO the problems surrounding this lack of providers are part of a larger systemic issue at the federal level .
Former Corona Centennial quarterback Tanner McKee will board a flight Monday to San Antonio , then to S√£o Paulo , Brazil , to begin his two-year Mormon mission . He 's bringing with him two footballs to a country that loves the other f√∫tbol .
He has been studying Portuguese and will spend six to eight weeks in training in S√£o Paulo before heading off to Curitiba , a city of 1.8 million . He 's 6 feet 6 , so it might be hard for him to keep a low profile . But he 'll be on his own for the first time .
‚Äú I think I 'm ready , ‚Äù he said Tuesday after spending a day at the beach with friends in one of his final days before departing . ‚Äú I 've been looking forward to it . ‚Äù
He 'll be able to email or write a letter once a week . He can call his family only on Mother 's Day and Christmas .
The goal , as he put it , is to ‚Äú become a man ‚Äù and help others as part of his church mission .
‚Äú There 's a ton of life lessons , ‚Äù he said .
His fans in Corona did n't exactly get a final chance to celebrate his many contributions at Centennial . He was stuck on the sideline in his team 's final football game last fall , the Division 1 semifinals , a 62-34 loss to St. John Bosco . He lost consciousness briefly in a game the week before and had to undergo concussion protocol .
‚Äú I was trying to get cleared but it did n't look good from the start , ‚Äù he said . ‚Äú I was trying to be a good teammate . ‚Äù
He was more than that . He earned great respect from teammates and opponents alike the way he played the game . His athleticism and intelligence enabled him to accept a football scholarship to Stanford , the school he will attend when he returns in the summer of 2020 .
He has been watching the World Cup and rooting for Brazil . As for his f√∫tbol skills , McKee said , ‚Äú It 's all right . Not great , especially for the standards down there . Hopefully they will improve . ‚Äù
He will get one hour each morning to work out . He '' ll be looking for kids and other volunteers to catch his passes when he throws a football each day during his eight-week training session . After that , he might get to throw once a week .
Either way , football is on hold . He has chosen to spend the next two years learning about life far away from home . You can bet he 'll be making a difference . And when he returns , his friends , family and fans will be ready to root for him in his comeback on the football field . It will go fast , and soon he 'll be a Stanford Cardinal .
From Lil Kim to Kesha to Azealia Banks to Fifth Harmony to Joan Jett to the Pointer Sisters , L.A . Pride 's concert component ( organized by the nonprofit Christopher Street West ) always boasts a powerhouse-driven and female-heavy bill . No surprise , as the LGBTQ+ community appreciates music diva fortitude and attitude better than anyone . And this year is no exception . L.A . Pride just announced its preliminary lineup , featuring two pop superstars on the festival 's mainstage : Kehlani ( June 9 ) and Tove Lo ( June 10 ) are both Grammy-nominated singers known for their honest and expressive approach to music .
Kehlani has come a long way since a suicide attempt back in 2016 made her a hot topic on social media . Her full-length debut , SweetSexySavage , was released to critical acclaim last year . Coupled with a breakout Coachella performance , it established the bisexual singer as a survivor who overcame heartbreak ( a theme reflected in her music ) and online bullying , something the gay community can obviously relate to and be inspired by . More recently Kehlani has been touring with Demi Lovato as her opening act , and is heard on Eminem 's new extended version of ‚Äú Nowhere Fast , ‚Äù which the pair performed last week at the 2018 IHeartRadio Music Awards .
Tove Lo , the provocative Swedish dance-music artist , who has an RIAA platinum debut album , Queen of the Clouds , and provocative follow-up Lady Wood ( yeah , it refers to what you think it does ) under her belt , should offer an equally bold performance on Sunday . Her most recent single , ‚Äú Disco Tits , ‚Äù off her third and current studio album , Blue Lips ( again , it 's about what you think ! ) , remains a club hit after reaching No . 1 on the Billboard Dance Charts last year . Like Kehlani , Lo is proudly bisexual as well , and her raunchy lyrics are an uncompromising celebration of women taking control of their desires and having fun , too .

In its early days , L.A. 's craft beer movement had one goal : to convince the masses that flavorful , hand-crafted beer is better than the so-called ‚Äú fizzy yellow stuff . ‚Äù
Nearly a decade later , at least some portion of that dream has been realized . Everything from IPA to Berliner weisse now can be found at nearly every supermarket and liquor store , right next to the fizzy yellow stuff . But where do you go to buy beer beyond the year-round Firestone Walker and Stone releases ? What if you want to try something entirely new but do n't know where to begin ?
From Long Beach to Westlake Village , El Monte to Redondo Beach , these are the best bottle shops in L.A. County ‚Äî the ones that care about the craft beer community , stock the best and rarest brews , and can always be counted on to sell both new and limited releases from independent local breweries , nationally known brands and international heavyweights alike .

Beverage Warehouse
As the name implies , Beverage Warehouse is a huge industrial building with rows of alcohol bottles that seem to go for miles .

It might not have the latest El Segundo IPA , but only here can you find entire lineups from Japanese breweries like Hitachino Nest and Yoho , along with Russian River sours , Rogue Farms seasonal ales and more Belgian-made stalwarts than anywhere else around .

The Heights Deli & Bottle Shop
Lincoln Heights is one of the oldest neighborhoods in L.A. , so it 's about time that the quiet neighborhood nestled in the rolling hills outside of downtown gets a respectable bottle shop to call its own . The Heights Deli & Bottle Shop concept is simple : Combine a Boar 's Head deli that makes sandwiches and pizza with two walls of brightly lit fridges stocked exclusively with uncommon California craft beer . Each fridge is labeled by beer style ( lagers , sours , browns , saisons , etc . ) and filled with a well-curated selection of bottles and cans from locals such as Eagle Rock and NorCal favorites Knee Deep ; it 's also still the only shop in L.A. that consistently carries beers from all five of the Baja craft breweries that distribute in the United States .

While the Marvel Cinematic Universe has been a monstrous success from a critical and commercial standpoint , the MCU certainly is n't perfect , and one gripe many fans have had relates to the diversity among its heroes . While the studio has taken steps to address these issues , a deaf actor , model and disability activist named Nyle DiMarco is calling on Marvel to make Hawkeye ( Jeremy Renner ) deaf in Avengers 4 . What 's more , there actually is a comic book precedence for Hawkeye being deaf as well .
Shortly after Avengers : Infinity War came out , DiMarco responded to a Mic article about Marvel 's challenges with diversity , stating that `` Disability is also a part of diversity , @ mic . HawkEye is actually Deaf and MARVEL Cinematic Universe made the character hearing . '' DiMarco is referring to a 1983 comic arc that started with Hawkeye # 4 by Mark Gruenwald , when Hawkeye lost his hearing during a battle with Crossfire . After DiMarco called them out , Mic invited the model/actor for an interview , where he spoke about having Hawkeye become a deaf character , while calling the current version of the character boring .
`` So many times people forget the disability conversation in diversity . They think diversity has to do with race ( and ) gender , but there 's so much more to it . We are part of diversity as people with disabilities and the danger is that we get excluded . There are a couple of issues where specifically Hawkeye is deaf . And so they brought in an actor who can hear instead . I think it would have made [ better movies ] ... if they brought a deaf person in to play a deaf Hawkeye . I mean , no offense , but Hawkeye in the Avengers is boring . A lot of people do n't even like him ... Let 's have a deaf actor in there instead , why not ? ''
In that 1983 comic , Hawkeye lost his hearing after battling Crossfire , who was trying to manipulate Hawkeye and Mockingbird with a machine known as Undertaker . To disable Undertaker 's effects , Hawkeye stuck a sonic arrow in his mouth , but when the arrow detonated , it left him without his hearing and he then started to communicate with American Sign Language in the comics . Naturally , Marvel did n't include this character trait when Jeremy Renner started playing Hawkeye , a.k.a . Clint Barton , in the MCU , but it 's certainly possible that could change , if not in Avengers 4 then perhaps with a different character in the MCU .
While Hawkeye was not present in Avengers : Infinity War , he has been confirmed to return in Avengers 4 , with set photos revealing his new haircut and outfit that seemingly hints his wife ( Linda Cardelinni ) and kids may have died . Hawkeye 's new costume was featured in the comics after Clint 's wife and kids were killed in a much different way , but there is speculation that the wife and kids may have been part of the Earth 's population that was wiped out when Thanos ( Josh Brolin ) obtained all six Infinity Stones . Take a look at DiMarco 's full interview , courtesy of Mic YouTube , with DiMarco 's Hawkeye comments coming at the 32-minute mark .

PARIS : Botox-maker Allergan has embarked on a big push in China where it plans to hire 200 additional staff this year and will also be on the lookout for potential acquisitions in the country , a senior executive told Reuters on Friday ( Feb 2 ) .
The drugmaker is about to complete a restructuring in which more than 1,000 staff will leave the company , more than 5 per cent of its current workforce , as it faces a drop in revenues coming from new competition for its second most important drug , dry-eye treatment Restasis .
Speaking on the sidelines of aesthetic and cosmetic dermatology congress IMCAS in Paris , Allergan 's Executive Vice President in charge of international operations Marc Princen said Allergan was eyeing annual sales of around US $ 500 million in China by 2022 .
The company recorded sales of around US $ 180 million there last year , he said .
`` At this point in time , 80 per cent of our sales are in the US and 20 per cent abroad . Over the next five years , we will bring the 20 per cent to 30 per cent , '' Princen said in an interview .
`` The focus will be on high potential must-win markets , for example China . We have added 300 staff there in 2017 and we grew revenues by 60 per cent . We will add another 200 this year , '' he said .

Princen said his team had identified 12 key markets outside the United States . Among them China , Brazil , Russia as well as European countries such as France , Italy , Germany and Spain .
`` I am a strong believer in mainland Europe for instance . We can have double-digit growth there by doing the right things . At the moment , in Europe , we have growth of around between 7-8 per cent , it will grow ... '' he said .
The executive said the company , which has recently bought Zeltiq Aesthetics for US $ 2.48 billion , had many options to grow out of its own resources but that other acquisitions would also be considered .
`` What we are not going to do : mega deals . We will not go into that . But we will buy early stage-products that we will develop and market further , the closer they are to launch , the better , '' he said without giving further details .

`` I will not go country by country on M & A . I would say though mainland Europe is important as well as Asia . ''
Princen said 90 per cent of the job cuts announced in November were completed .
`` If we look at the proportion , its 800 departures in the US and 200 outside the US , '' he said .
The company is due to publish its annual results on Feb 6 .
STERLING , Va./ WHITE SULPHUR SPRINGS , W. Va. ( Reuters ) ‚Äì The U.S. Congress made no notable progress this week toward a deal on the status of 700,000 ‚Äú Dreamer ‚Äù immigrants , with President Donald Trump saying on Friday that one ‚Äú could very well not happen ‚Äù by a deadline next month .
Whether the lack of progress signaled the possibility of another federal government shutdown next week was unclear , but it worried the Dreamers , young people who were brought illegally into the United States as children .
Trump said last year that he would end by March 5 a program that was set up by former President Barack Obama to protect the Dreamers from deportation , and he urged Congress to act before that date . No action has resulted .
‚Äú We want to make a deal , ‚Äù Trump said at an event in Virginia with U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials . And he blamed Democratic lawmakers for the impasse .

‚Äú I think they want to use it for political purposes for elections . I really am not happy with the way it 's going from the standpoint of the Democrats , ‚Äù he said .
Democrats have said repeatedly that they want protections written into law for the Dreamers , who were given temporary legal status by Obama 's Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals ( DACA ) program , which lets them study and work in the United States without fear of deportation .
Republicans , who control Congress , are undecided on what to do about DACA and the Dreamers . They ended a three-day retreat at a mountain resort in West Virginia on Friday not much nearer to consensus than they were a week ago .
WATCH : Democrats withdraw border wall funding over ‚Äò Dreamers ' dispute
The partisan standoff caused a partial shutdown of the federal government for three days last month after Congress failed to pass a stopgap spending measure needed to keep the lights on at federal facilities across the country .
The House of Representatives plans to vote on Tuesday on legislation to keep federal agencies operating beyond Feb. 8 , when existing funds expire , a senior House Republican aide said .
The aide did not provide details , however , on the duration of this latest-in-a-series of temporary funding measures .

Democrats have leverage on the immigration issue because their votes are needed to pass spending measures in the Senate .
The next spending deadline looms on Thursday , with Democrats defiant in their demands and Republicans remaining divided .
Four-part offer
Trump has offered the Dreamers a path to citizenship , but only on the condition he also gets funding for a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border , as well as other immigration-related measures that Democrats oppose .
Last month , he proposed letting 1.8 million Dreamers stay in the country and become citizens in exchange for $ 25 billion for the wall , curbs on family-sponsored immigration , and an end to a visa lottery program .
Some lawmakers want Trump 's four-part immigration framework pared back , while others want it approved or made even more strict on future immigration .
‚Äú If we can solve DACA and border security that may be the best I can hope for , ‚Äù Senator John Thune , a member of the Republican leadership , told reporters at the retreat .

Senator James Lankford was among Republicans who said this week that Trump could give Congress more time to reach a deal by extending the Dreamers ' deadline beyond March 5 .
Trump reiterated on Thursday at the retreat that all four components of his framework must be included in a deal , a stance viewed as unworkable by many lawmakers in both parties .
Some Republicans say the March 5 deadline lost its power last month when a federal court blocked the rescinding of DACA . That meant the law would remain in effect until the Supreme Court resolves the case , which is unlikely by March 5 .
In a research note , financial firm Height Analytics set the odds of another shutdown next week at 65 percent .
Republicans are trying to call Democrats ' bluff on DACA , but the Democrats look even more willing to allow a shutdown than they were last month , the analysts said . ‚Äú What this has become is a very absurd game of chicken , ‚Äù they said in the note .
The Karnataka Police on Wednesday charged four men in connection with the murder of journalist-activist Gauri Lankesh who had earlier been arrested for allegedly plotting to kill Kannada writer and critic KS Bhagwan in Mysore .
According to a report in The Indian Express , the Special Investigative Team ( SIT ) has recovered from them three diaries with handwritten notes about carrying out covert operations and a map which is suspected to be of Lankesh 's house .
All the four are linked to Mangaluru-based right-wing organisation Sanatan Sanstha and its affiliate Hindu Janajagruti Samiti ( HJS ) and have been identified as Sujeet Kumar alias Praveen , 37 , a resident of Karnataka ; Amol Kale alias Bhaisab , 39 , from Maharashtra ; Amit Degwekar alias Pradeep , 39 , of Goa ; and Manohar Edave , 28 , from Karnataka . The SIT will place them under arrest on Thursday after obtaining their custody , sources told The Indian Express .
Apparently , the four are also closely linked to KT Naveen Kumar who was the first arrest to be made in the Lankesh murder case on 2 March . Kumar is an activist of the Hindu Yuva Sena and had attended several meetings of the HJS and Sanatan Sanstha in 2017 , states the report .
As per a report in The Wire , the SIT has filed a 650-page chargesheet in the Lankesh case on Wednesday naming only Kumar ‚Äî for the time being ‚Äî as an accused . Kumar is accused of locating her home for the eventual perpetrators and of providing information about her movements . The SIT has also provided details of Kumar 's telephonic conversations with friends and family about his alleged links to the Lankesh murder .
Following his arrest , Kumar had told investigators that he received much of the instructions for the suspected killings from a Mangalore- based man named Sujeet Kumar who was later arrested .
The SIT is also extending the probe to find out if Kumar and his accomplices had any links with the murder of rationalists MM Kalburgi , Govind Pansare and Narendra Dabholkar in the past , Bangalore Mirror reported . But , the SIT has stated that it was yet to recover the firearm used in the killing even though Kumar has been booked for murder , criminal conspiracy and concealment of evidence under Section 25 ( 3 ) of the Arms Act , the Bangalore Mirror report says .
Gauri Lankesh , editor of the weekly Lankesh Patrike magazine , was shot dead by unidentified men at her residence in Bengaluru on 5 September . The state government had set up a SIT to probe the killing and had announced a Rs 10 lakh reward to anyone providing clues/information that could lead to the capture of her killers .
Finance Minister Arun Jaitley has done several things in Budget 2018 quietly without fanfare . One of them is taxability of interest of senior citizens . As it is , everyone irrespective of his age gets deduction of Rs 10,000 uniformly from his gross total income under section 80TTA if it includes interest from savings bank account ( s ) .
Jaitley has introduced another section 80TTB under which senior citizens would get a hefty deduction upto Rs 50,000 if their gross total income includes interest from fixed deposits with banks . For good measure and in sync with this , he has also amended section 194A asking banks not to deduct tax at source from senior citizens on Fixed Deposits ( FD ) interest upto Rs 50,000 per annum . There is no TDS on savings bank interest . So far so good .
While doing this , he has played a small but significant mischief . He has thrown the gauntlet at the senior citizens -- -choose between section 80TTA and section 80TTB . In other words , the two benefits are going to be mutually exclusive . The bottomline is senior citizens whose pet investment is FD would normally plump for the new tax saver section 80TTB because it begets them a greater tax exemption vis-√†-vis section 80TTA . In the event , their savings bank interest would become fully taxable which is a pity .
There are senior citizens still standing on their own slender , enfeebled legs . They perforce have to keep a large amount in their savings account because loneliness brings with it a feeling of insecurity .
Money on tap is more valuable than money in tank as it were , as far as they are concerned . This is not to say that they do n't invest in fixed deposits . They do . But they also keep a sizeable amount in savings account so that they can draw from it anytime without much ado to meet numerous emergencies that routinely assail them . It is cruel to wrench away a small tax benefit from them just because they perforce plumped for a larger and newer tax benefit .
The new tax benefit is , however , going to make senior citizens more wanted . Grown-up sons and daughters-in-law as well as grandchildren might choose to park their surplus funds by opening fixed deposits in the name of the family patriarch as well as the matriarch . And given the longevity that has come to characterize our demography , there could be a cornucopia of senior and very senior citizens in a family .
Imagine patriarch and matriarch and grand patriarch and grand matriarch as well in a family . The four of them among them come to enjoy hefty tax break of Rs 2 lakh sans hassles of TDS . The doting children and grandchildren only have to get their names inserted as nominees just in case . Levity aside , the senior citizens would be only too happy to be of use to the family and return the money ( principal as well as interest ) to whosoever it belonged .
This wo n't be a new trend or show of affection . It all started ever since the income tax law started giving extra benefits to senior and very senior citizens , with the latter not being taxed on their first Rs 5 lakh of income . Families are often united by tax considerations if not by affection .
LONGMEADOW - Bay Path University 's 16th Writers ' Day , which features three afternoon sessions Sunday , Oct. 15 , will focus not only on the development of ideas and narrative , but also on a writer 's verbal presentation as well .
Poet and writer Charles Coe will present the session , `` Standing Your Ground : Thoughts on Reading in Public , '' for writers who `` want to become more comfortable and effective reading their work in public . ''
`` The talk on being a better reader was booked after the great response to Charles Coe giving that same presentation back in July , at the third annual Summer Writing Seminar that Bay Path University 's MFA program hosts each year in Dingle , Ireland , '' said Suzanne Strempek Shea , facilitator of the seminar and the university 's writer-in-residence and director of the undergraduate creative writing program .
`` So many of our participants were interested in what is often a 'missing piece ' for writers - we might be very skilled in writing a story but standing up and reading that story before an audience is a whole other thing . Yet that very public reading and speaking is part of any successful writing career , so it 's something a writer needs to learn to do well . ''
Shea added , `` As a veteran writer and professional singer and musician , Charles is very much at home on the stage . But that did n't happen automatically . Via tips and working with several volunteers from his audience , he 'll share common pitfalls and ways to navigate around or through them . ''
`` Attendees can be certain that they 'll leave with memorable messages , including one of the first he likes to note , that unless we 're testifying before Congress , there 's really no need to get all nervous about this speaking in public/reading in public thing , '' said Shea , author of more than a dozen books , of the Coe session that will be held from 2:35 to 3:50 p.m .
Shea said another session , which runs from 4:10 to 5:25 p.m. , will featuring a panel of writers - Ellen Meeropol , Meredith O'Brien and Joan Dempsey - talking about how current events can inspire a novel .
`` Our 'Swimming With the Current ' panel will showcase writers who 've used current events as springboards for their fiction and nonfiction , '' she said .
`` It 's something I am fascinated by and inspired by , the way a true story can spark a dazzlingly real but made-up tale , or how it can be what gets a writer to want to spend years researching an issue or following a person through her daily life . I 'm hoping the panel will do the same for attendees who might mine their own work from what 's happening in their communities or somewhere across the globe . ''
Meeropol is author of `` Kinship of Clover , '' O'Brien , `` Mr. Clark 's Big Band '' and Dempsey 's `` This is How It Begins '' was released this month .
She said Dempsey replaces previously scheduled panelist Elizabeth Searle who is unable to attend .
The middle session of the day is `` Mining the Personal for your Nonfiction '' with Patricia Reis , author of the memoir `` Motherlines : Love , Longing and Liberation , '' from 1 to 2:15 p.m. During the session , Reis is expected to discuss how a writer can use `` personal experiences , memories , documents , letters , diaries and more '' to `` craft nonfiction of any length . ''
Cost to attend one workshop is $ 40 ; two , $ 75 and three , $ 100 .
Registration and check-in begins at noon in the D'Amour Hall for Business , Communications and Technology , and continues until the start of session three .
Registration may also be done online .
The event generally attracts between 40 to 50 participants . Refreshments will be served , and a limited copy of authors ' books will be available for purchase and signing .

Joan Sweeney spotted this painted turtle basking in the sun at the pond at Kirby Park on Friday morning , April 14 . ‚Äú It is a very large and probably very old turtle . We were delighted to have seen it , ‚Äù she wrote .
REUTERS : The manhunt for a murder suspect who police said posted a video of himself on Facebook shooting an elderly man in Cleveland on Sunday widened Monday as authorities asked the public for help and pleaded with the suspect to turn himself in .
Police said they have searched `` dozens of locations '' for the suspect , Steve Stephens , and tried to convince him to turn himself in when they spoke with him on his cell phone on Sunday . But Stephens remains at large as the hunt for him expands in Ohio and neighbouring states , they said .
`` Obviously , this individual is armed and dangerous , and quite frankly at this point he could be in a lot of places , '' Federal Bureau of Investigation Special Agent in Charge Stephen Anthony told a news conference in Cleveland .
Police said Stephens used Facebook to post video of him killing 74-year-old Robert Godwin Sr. Stephens is not believed to have known Godwin , a retired foundry worker who media reports said spent Easter Sunday morning with his son and daughter-in-law before he was killed on camera in the street .
Stephens , who has no prior criminal record , is not suspected in any other murders , despite a claim he made in the video of having killed more than a dozen other people , police said .
`` We know that Steve is still out there , '' said Cleveland police Chief Calvin Williams . `` We 're asking the public to remain vigilant . We 're asking you to go about your day , but be careful . ''
The last confirmed sighting of Stephens was at the scene of the homicide . Police said he might be driving a white or cream-coloured Ford Fusion , and asked anyone who spots him or his car to call police or a special FBI hotline ( 800-CALLFBI ) .
`` We 're still asking Steve to turn himself in , '' said Williams . `` But if he does n't , we 'll find him . ''
Late Sunday night Cleveland police issued an aggravated murder warrant for Stephens and warned he could have crossed into Pennsylvania , New York , Indiana or Michigan .
It is not the first time a serious crime has been posted on Facebook . In January , four black people in Chicago were accused of attacking an 18-year-old disabled white man and broadcasting the assault on the social media site while making anti-white racial taunts .
A month later , the suspects pleaded not guilty to assaulting the man .

BANGKOK , 24 April 2018 ( NNT ) ‚Äì Officials in Bangkok have given residents of the Pom Mahakan Community until tomorrow ( April 25 ) to vacate the area and have continued to demolish structures .
Officials in Bangkok have confirmed that April 25 is the deadline for residents of the Pom Mahakan Community to vacate . However , residents , such as Supanach Prachuabsuk , say they are yet to come to terms with their eviction because many were born in the community and remain uncertain as to where they will go next . Other residents , like Pornthep Booranabureedej , have accepted the situation and found new housing . Officials handling the demolition are also assisting community members to relocate .

WA dairy farmers who supply to Brownes are being given the opportunity to produce about 10 per cent more milk within the next 12-18 months as part of the company 's new growth strategy .
WA 's oldest dairy was bought by Chinese dairy giant Shanghai Ground Food Tech in December , voicing plans to grow the business .
A major component of facilitating that growth involves a $ 10 million investment to restart the mothballed Brunswick Cheese Factory in the South West .
At full capacity , in three to five years time , the factory would manufacture up to 6000 tonnes of cheese a year , using 60 million litres of milk , equivalent to 15 per cent of the State 's current annual supply .
Most of the cheese produced would be exported to Brownes ' parent company in China .
Finance News Presenter Meilin Chew looks back at the history of WA 's oldest dairy as Shanghai Ground Food Tech takes control . The West Australian Finance News Presenter Meilin Chew looks back at the history of WA 's oldest dairy as Shanghai Ground Food Tech takes control .
Brownes managing director Tony Girgis said the ability to manufacture milk into cheese meant that the dairy 's 49 farmers had been told they could grow their production if they wished .
‚Äú We are pursuing a deliberate strategy of allowing current suppliers to grow in a progressive and well-managed way , ‚Äù he said .
‚Äú A commitment I 've made to our farmer base that we will give everyone in the pot a chance to grow . ‚Äù
Brownes has asked its suppliers to provide their three-year milk production forecasts by end of May .
It was therefore too early to know how many would increase their scale , but Mr Girgis said that some farmers had already shared intentions to grow their business by at least 10 per cent over the next 12-18 months . There was no intention to take on additional suppliers , unless Brownes ' own farmers could not fulfil the dairy 's forecast requirements .
Separately , it remains unclear what corporate dairy farm Lactanz , a cluster of four farms in Scott River , north-east of Augusta , is planning for its circa 20 million litres of milk , given Harvey Fresh has advised it would not renew Lanctanz 's contract after it expires in July .
AAG Investment Management , which owns Lactanz , did not return calls .
The parents of a 15-year-old girl killed in a fiery car crash while evacuating the Fort McMurray wildfire last spring are planning to build a park in her memory .
Emily Ryan and her cousin Aaron Hodgson , 19 , were killed in a highway collision one day after the entire Fort McMurray area was evacuated in May .
They had made their way to Anzac on the evening of May 3 , but the evacuation centre was full . They camped out overnight and then started driving down Highway 881 toward Lac La Biche the next day .
Emily , a triplet , was riding with her cousin when their vehicle collided head-on with a logging truck and burst into flames .
‚Äú Life has changed , dynamics have changed but we do n't want to stay stuck in grief , ‚Äù Melonie Matthews-Ryan , Emily 's stepmom , said Monday .
‚Äú We want to have something to focus on to give other people a way to remember the kids and not just remember their death . ‚Äù

Melonie and her husband , Cranley Ryan , the deputy fire chief in Saprae Creek , initially thought they would build a bench in an existing park to honour their daughter but offers to help do more from the community and complete strangers quickly began to pour in .
‚Äú Initially there were a few people asking what we needed or if they could do something , ‚Äù Cranley said . ‚Äú As more and more people were offering then we kind of said , ‚Äò maybe we can do something good for the entire community . ' ‚Äù
The Ryan family has already collected about $ 16,000 through fundraising . Heinz Kraft Project Play , which is dedicated to building places for people to play across Canada , has committed $ 25,000 for the park .
‚Äú We feel like we 're well on our way to having a park that 's bigger than what we could have ever dreamed , ‚Äù Melonie said .
The family has support from the municipality and hopes to build the park in the devastated Beacon Hill neighbourhood , where Emily went to elementary school .
‚Äú There was so much damage and destruction , ‚Äù Cranley said . ‚Äú I think it would mean a lot to the community of Beacon Hill , and the Beacon Hill school and Emily and ourselves if it was somewhere in the vicinity of the school .
‚Äú We 're hopeful to do something great for the community that 'll give us somewhere to go and a memory to hold onto and a place to build new memories for families for years to come . A legacy . ‚Äù

The couple hopes the park can provide a peaceful place for families to come together . Because Emily and Aaron were both into reading , they envision benches where people can spend time with a good book or watch their kids play .
‚Äú Emily loved Harry Potter , Alice in Wonderland , the Wizard of Oz ‚Äì some of these characters ‚Äì she loved those types of things so I kind of envisioned trying to use that to represent who she was , ‚Äù Melonie said .
‚Äú When people come to the park not only do they just see their names , but they leave there feeling like they kind of knew who the kids were . ‚Äù
Watch below : She was a daughter , a sister and a friend to so many . Fifteen-year-old Emily Ryan and her cousin Aaron Hodgson were killed while fleeing the Fort McMurray wildfire in May . They are the only deaths connected to the massive blaze . Erin Chalmers sat down with the family in June as they returned home for the first time without Emily .
The Ryans ' family home in Saprae Creek was extensively damaged in the wildfire . While the structure of the home remained standing , the house suffered water and smoke damage . The Ryans lived in their RV for a while but have been living in a rental home in Fort McMurray for the past several months .
They look forward to moving back home , hopefully in the next couple of months .
‚Äú There 's been so many struggles along the way . In November we kind of took some time privately to kind of deal with what we were going to have to face when we eventually get home . Many families , when they lose a loved one ‚Äì especially a child ‚Äì you go home that night and grieve in your own bed and some of that has been held over because we have n't been back , ‚Äù Melonie said .
‚Äú We 're hoping for a fresh start . It 'll be good to get home and to finally be able to be our family unit as we were before the fire hopefully . As best we can , put things back together . ‚Äù
The couple hopes to have the park up and running by the end of 2017 or early 2018 . Anyone who wishes to contribute to the project can visit any Scotia Bank branch and donate to the ER Park Rebuild Trust Fund . E-transfers can be made to eparkrebuild @ hotmail.com .

TFPC President Vishal on ongoing no-new-release stance in Tamil Nadu : 'This strike is an attempt to revamp the industry '
It has been more than three weeks since the no-new-release rule came into place in the Tamil film industry , bringing the entire fraternity to a grinding halt from 1 March . The strike reached its zenith when the Tamil Film Producers Council ( TFPC ) placed an indefinite embargo on all post-production activities , film shoots , press meets and audio/teaser/trailer launches on 16 March .
Now , a handful of movies , which are being filmed in foreign locations , will also come to a standstill from 23 March as the ongoing rift between TFPC and Digital Service Providers ( DSPs ) widens by the day as both parties continue to argue against each other without any amicable solution .
Speaking to reporters in Chennai , Vishal , president of the TFPC , responded to an array of queries regarding the shutdown and the reason behind his sudden meeting with Kamal Haasan . `` When it comes to our film industry , Kamal sir is a vital personality and I felt that it 's my responsibility to explain to him about the pressing need for this shutdown , in person . That 's the agenda of this meeting . I have elucidated the reasons behind our protest and he shared his thoughts . It was a healthy discussion . He has always been acting in the best interests of the industry . He is someone who has never hesitated to voice his opinions and to be great support vehemently . I do n't intend to mean that the purpose of this meeting is just to solicit his help . His involvement is highly critical in a situation like this , '' said Vishal .
Asked if he would meet superstar Rajinikanth to explain him about the stalemate , Vishal replied in the affirmative . `` Though they ( Rajinikanth and Kamal Haasan ) have entered politics , they are indispensable to the film industry . Also as the General Secretary of Artists Association and President of TFPC , I owe an explanation to the legendary personalities who belong to the association . I will meet Rajini sir too very soon . ''
Vishal stressed that the ongoing strike is not a selfish choice made my the TFPC as an act of ego . `` Rather than using the term strike or shut down , I would choose to say this as an attempt to renovate and revamp the industry . We have been negotiating with various stakeholders including directors union , cameramen association , theatre owners association with the intent of bringing out some changes . This shutdown is definitely not an act of ego . Producers strive a lot to make a film , and when it comes to releasing them , it 's a whole new set of struggles they face at that time . It has to change . ''
Vishal also appealed to theater owners in the state to pay heed to the long-time requests of producers . `` Our demands are quite fundamental . Our first request is to computerise the ticketing across all theaters . Also , a change in terms with the DSPs is not too much to ask for . I 'm not trying to poke my nose into the theatre 's food business . All we are attempting is to make the movie-going experience affordable to the commoners . Burdening the audience with online booking fee , parking charges and a lot more is not going to help in increasing the footfalls . We are not proposing any unreasonable demands . We are just asking to bring down the charges to make film-watching an inexpensive experience . ''
Responding to questions about the skyrocketing salary of big heroes , which in turn overshoots the production budget , Vishal said , `` Tamil Nadu is the only state with double taxation after GST imposition . We negotiated with the government and brought the state tax from thirty percent to eight percent , which is still a considerable amount . There have been multiple statements about the remuneration of artists . Only when the theatres computerise the ticketing and provide the association with the exact numbers on the collection , we can do something about it . A distributor should know the correct figures of a show after it ends and before the next show commences . It will bring more transparency and stars would also get to know their box office prowess precisely , '' he stated .
Meanwhile , veteran distributor Tiruppur Subramaniam , in an audio message , has requested producers to understand the plight of exhibitors and treat them as friends . `` When DSPs hit the market with their projectors , the producers said it would cut the cost of printing and the quality will not degrade with multiple screening . When this promise was made , we migrated to digital and now the producers , who had then agreed to pay the VPF charges for the projectors , are now protesting against paying . We have been renewing the contracts as the technology evolves and latest projectors are being replaced with the old ones . And when the producers ca n't pay the charges and with a big chunk of the advertisement money directly going into the pocket of DSPs , how can a theatre owner earn the profit ? '' points out Subramaniam .
Another accusation on theater owners is the online booking fee charged on film-goers . `` The online booking charge is not enjoyed entirely by theatre owners ; a fair share goes to the booking agency and the bank too . For exhibitors , there are expenses to be met like the electricity , staffing and maintenance . The producers think we are basking in money and they see us as their rivals , '' said Subramaniam .

America 's Recording Academy president Neil Portnow has denied Beyonce 's losing out on the top prizes at the Grammy Awards was due to racial bias .
The Formation singer , 35 , won the Best Urban Contemporary Album and Best Music Video prizes at Sunday 's ceremony but lost to Adele in the prestigious Record , Song and Album of the Year categories .
With her unexpected loss meaning no female African-American artist has won in the Album of the Year category since Lauryn Hill in 1999 , fans and musicians including Beyonce 's sister Solange and St. Vincent have accused Recording Academy voters of being biased against non-white artists .
Sufjan Stevens burns the Grammys over @ Beyonce snub https : //t.co/xdflfjXR1G ‚Äî Pitchfork ( @ pitchfork ) February 14 , 2017
Portnow has denied the claims however , saying that members of his organisation are experts who are unswayed by the race of an artist .
‚Äú No , I do n't think there 's a race problem at all , ‚Äù he told Pitchfork Media . ‚Äú Remember , this is a peer-voted award . So when we say the Grammys , it 's not a corporate entity - it 's the 14,000 members of the Academy .
Grammys ' Portnow : `` You do n't get Chance the Rapper as Best New Artist if you have a membership that is n't diverse '' https : //t.co/N3BCb7Mxpn ‚Äî Pitchfork ( @ pitchfork ) February 14 , 2017
‚Äú They have to qualify in order to be members , which means they have to have recorded and released music , and so they are sort of the experts and the highest level of professionals in the industry . ‚Äù
Even Adele was shocked to beat Beyonce , whose pioneering visual album Lemonade was hailed by critics as one of 2016 's defining cultural moments .
Defending the Academy 's members from the accusations , Portnow added , ‚Äú We do n't , as musicians , in my humble opinion , listen to music based on gender or race or ethnicity . When you go to vote on a piece of music - at least the way that I approach it - is you almost put a blindfold on and you listen . ‚Äù
The Recording Academy Chief cited Chance the Rapper 's win in the Best New Artist category as evidence voters honoured musicians of all backgrounds .
He also denied his organisation needed a membership shake-up like the one the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences ( AMPAS ) chiefs embarked upon after no non-white actors were nominated at the 2016 Oscars .
‚Äú Well , they may have had a problem , ‚Äù he explained . ‚Äú We do n't have that kind of issue in that same fashion . ‚Äù
The gunman who attacked a congressional baseball practice in Virginia on Wednesday , wounding five , has been identified as a passionate Bernie Sanders supporter and campaign volunteer who had long expressed his hatred for Republicans on social media . He was pronounced dead shortly after the attack .
James T. Hodgkinson , 66 , of Belleville , Ill. , had repeatedly likened the GOP to ‚Äú a group of terrorists ‚Äù in hyperbolic posts dating back to at least 2014 , according to a Facebook profile under his name .
Over recent months , President Trump and congressional Republicans were central targets of Hodgkinson 's ire . In a May 31 post he called Trump and his family ‚Äú traitors ‚Äù who ‚Äú Need to Be Prosecuted to the Fullest Extent of the Law . ‚Äù
‚Äú Republicans Hate Women , Minorities , Working Class People , & Most All ( 99 % ) of the People of the Country , ‚Äù Hodgkinson wrote on May 26 .
Sanders , an independent senator from Vermont who captured left-wing support during his campaign for the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination , said in a statement that Hodgkinson had apparently volunteered for his campaign . Sanders denounced the violence and offered his sympathies for the victims .
`` I am sickened by this despicable act , ‚Äù Sanders said . ‚Äú Let me be as clear as I can be . Violence of any kind is unacceptable in our society and I condemn this action in the strongest possible terms . ''
Hodgkinson was a home inspector in downstate Illinois and a Democratic supporter who had written multiple letters to the editor of the Belleville News-Democrat in 2012 , often opposing Republicans or supporting marijuana legalization .
A neighbor in Belleville , Aaron Muerer , 33 , said Hodgkinson lived in a well-kept home in a rural area on the south side of town and had kept a Sanders sign in his yard during the 2016 election .
Muerer said that he had n't seen Hodgkinson in recent months . Hodgkinson had recently obtained a used white van , and Muerer said he assumed Hodgkinson had retired and left on a trip .
Before leaving home , Muerer said Hodgkinson often worked in the yard or on the house and would sometimes wave and say hi . Muerer said he 'd never seen Hodgkinson would sometimes talk about politics but showed no signs of violent behavior and instability .
‚Äú He had mentioned stuff about Republicans and high taxes and not taxing the rich enough , stuff like that , ‚Äù Meurer said . ‚Äú Nothing too extreme or too violent . ‚Äù
A former construction industry acquaintance , Bill Stanis , of St. Louis called Hodgkinson ‚Äú a little off . ‚Äù
‚Äú He was just always very opinionated in what he thought should be right , ‚Äù Stanis said . ‚Äú He was always quick to tell you what he thought it was and what he thought it should be . ‚Äù
Stanis had worked with Hodgkinson on construction projects 20 or 30 years ago , but Stanis lost touch after he moved from Belleville from St. Louis . He said Hodgkinson and his wife had adopted a daughter from an Asian country .
But the pair reconnected in 2013 when Stanis hired Hodgkinson ‚Äî who Stanis said went by the nickname ‚Äú Tom ‚Äù ‚Äî to inspect his new home .
‚Äú I had known Tom in the past , was actually friends with him , but had lost touch with him for many years , ‚Äù Stanis said . ‚Äú He was just as crazy as as I thought he was 20 years ago . ‚Äù
But when it took Stanis more than two weeks to send Hodgkinson a check for the work , Hodgkinson immediately sued him , which stunned Stanis .
‚Äú Dude , I had n't seen you for 20 years , and you sue me ? ‚Ä¶ I ca n't believe you did that to me , ‚Äù Stanis remembered thinking . Stanis said he paid Hodgkinson at court and the case was dismissed , and Stanis told Hodgkinson he did n't want to see him for another 20 years .
Still , nothing prepared him for Wednesday 's events . ‚Äú I would never have thought he would do something like this , ‚Äù Stanis said . ‚Äú It flabbergasts me . ‚Äù
On Facebook , Hodgkinson was a member of several liberal-leaning groups . Among them : ‚Äú The Road to Hell is Paved with Republicans , ‚Äù ‚Äú Donald Trump is Not My President , ‚Äù ‚Äú Terminate the Republican Party , ‚Äù and ‚Äú President Bernie Sanders . ‚Äù
Howard Pearlman is the founder of the national group ‚Äú Terminate the Republican Party . ‚Äù
Pearlman said Wednesday he did not personally know Hodgkinson .
‚Äú But I 've seen him post some , ‚Äù Pearlman , who called his group left-leaning , said from his Cherry Hill , N.J. , home . ‚Äú Everyone posts‚Äî we 're really political . ‚Äù
‚Äú It 's terrible what he did , ‚Äù Pearlman said of the gunman . ‚Äú I ‚Äî and we as a group ‚Äî do not condone this at all . ‚Äù

SYDNEY : Officials at an Australian immigration centre in Papua New Guinea are increasing pressure on asylum seekers to return to their home countries voluntarily , including offering large sums of money , amid fears a deal for the United States to take refugees has fallen through .
About a dozen Bangladeshi and Nepalese asylum seekers on Manus Island told Reuters they are being repeatedly called to meet with Australian officials and pressured to take amounts of up to US $ 25,000 to return to those countries , or face deportation .
The men , who have been ruled ineligible for refugee status by Papua New Guinea , said officials are also acting with urgency on deportation notices filed weeks or months ago . At least one Nepalese man was removed from his accommodation in the middle of the night last week , they said .
`` They told me and others that if you go back voluntarily you will get money about US $ 20,000 , if you guys go in group you will get more money , '' detainee Mohammad Bilal , a crane driver who says he fled Bangladesh for political reasons , told Reuters about a meeting with Australian officials last week .
Offering money to failed asylum seekers to return home is not illegal . However , the sums being offered by Australian officials have more than doubled since a year ago , and are far above the funds being offered elsewhere .
Germany , for example , recently announced plans to offer up to 1,200 euros ( US $ 1,275 ) to asylum seekers to voluntarily return home .
`` Substantial assistance packages are available to help non-refugees depart voluntarily , return home and re-establish their lives in their home country , '' Australia 's immigration department said in an emailed statement to Reuters . `` In cases where non-refugees refuse to depart voluntarily , the government of PNG has indicated that it will enforce the removal of those individuals , in accordance with normal international practice . ''
The department declined to comment in more detail .
Australia does not reveal the cost of its offshore processing program . However , a 2016 report from Unicef and Save the Children estimated the policy had cost AUS $ 10 billion ( US $ 7.7 billion ) over the previous three years .
DOUBTS ON U.S. DEAL
The Papua New Guinea Supreme Court last year ruled the Manus Island centre , which houses around 860 men , breached human rights and was illegal , adding pressure on Australia to find a new solution .
But U.S. President 's Donald Trump 's immigration ban has thrown doubt over a swap deal agreed in the final months of the previous administration .
The United States committed to take up to 1,250 asylum seekers being held on behalf of Australia on Manus and Nauru , another Pacific island nation . In return , Australia will take refugees from Central America .
The deal sparked a rare diplomatic spat between the two allies , with Trump berating Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull before reluctantly agreeing to honour the deal , subject to `` extreme vetting '' of would-be refugees .
While the numbers of asylum seekers trying to reach Australia pale in comparison to those flooding into Europe , losing the U.S. deal would be a major set-back for Turnbull . His centre-right coalition came to power on policies that deny any asylum seeker trying to reach Australia by boat from ever being allowed to settle there .
OFFERING CASH
There are 225 men on Manus currently eligible for deportation as so-called `` double negatives '' - people who have twice had their refugee claims rejected .
Bangladeshi and Nepalese detainees are being targeted for both deportation and voluntary return , human rights advocates and lawyers said , because Iran does not accept deported citizens and international law prevents the return of people to war torn countries such as Syria and Afghanistan . Nationals from Pakistan , Sri Lanka and Myanmar are also held in the centre .
Bangladeshi detainee Mohammad Rasel told Reuters he was offered US $ 19,500 to return to Bangladesh voluntarily , more if he convinced a group of his countrymen to go with him , during interview with an Australian Border Force official on Manus last Tuesday .
Another detainee who requested anonymity told Reuters that ABF officials met with a group of twelve Nepalese men on Friday , telling them they could either accept an offer of between US $ 10,000 and US $ 25,000 to go home voluntarily , or be deported .
Lawyers and refugee advocates have raised concerns about process .
`` The increased focus by the Australian and PNG governments on deporting people with negative protection assessments is deeply troubling , '' said Sanmati Verma , a lawyer at Clothier Anderson Immigration Lawyers who represent several people on Manus and Nauru . `` All of the circumstances indicate that those people have never had their claims for protection fairly , legally or impartially assessed . ''
The Papua New Guinea government did not respond to emailed and telephoned requests for comment on its refugee assessment practices .
Sally Thompson from Refugee Rights Action Network said long delays before processing began seriously compromised detainees ' mental health and many were afraid to speak freely before the migration agents supplied by the Australian government .
`` Those with final negative assessments from PNG Immigration have been unable to access pro bono lawyers with standing in PNG Courts who can challenge these decisions on procedural grounds , '' she said .

MANCHESTER , N.H. ( AP ) ‚Äî Unveiling a long-awaited plan to combat the national scourge of opioid drug addiction , President Donald Trump called Monday for stiffer penalties for drug traffickers , including embracing a tactic employed by some of the global strongmen he admires : the death penalty .
‚Äú Toughness is the thing that they most fear , ‚Äù Trump said .
The president traveled to New Hampshire , a state ravaged by opioids and which is also an early marker for the re-election campaign he has already announced . The president called for broadening awareness about drug addiction while expanding access to proven treatment and recovery efforts , but the backbone of his plan is to toughen the punishment for those caught trafficking highly addictive drugs .
‚Äú This is n't about nice anymore , ‚Äù Trump said . ‚Äú This is about winning a very , very tough problem and if we do n't get very tough on these dealers it 's not going to happen folks ‚Ä¶ I want to win this battle . ‚Äù
The president formalized what he had long mused about publicly and privately : that if a person in the U.S. can get the death penalty or life in prison for shooting one person , a similar punishment should be given to a drug dealer who potentially kills thousands .
Trump has long spoken approvingly about countries like Singapore that have fewer issues with drug addiction because they harshly punish their dealers . During a trip to Asia last fall , he did not publicly rebuke Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte , who authorized extrajudicial killings of his nation 's drug dealers .
Outside a local firehouse that Trump visited before the speech , someone compared the leaders with a sign that said : ‚Äú Donald J. Duterte . ‚Äù
‚Äú Drug traffickers kill so many thousands of our citizens every year , ‚Äù Trump said . ‚Äú That 's why my Department of Justice will be seeking so many tougher penalties than we 've ever had and we 'll be focusing on the penalties that I talked about previously for big pushers , the ones that are killing so many people , and that penalty is going to be the death penalty . ‚Äù
He added : ‚Äú Other countries do n't play games . ‚Ä¶ But the ultimate penalty has to be the death penalty . ‚Äù
The Justice Department said the federal death penalty is available for limited drug-related offenses , including violations of the ‚Äú drug kingpin ‚Äù provisions in federal law .
It is not clear if the death penalty , even for traffickers whose product causes multiple deaths , would be constitutional . Doug Berman , a law professor at Ohio State University , predicted the issue would be litigated all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court .
John Blume , a professor and director of Cornell Law School 's death penalty program , said the Federal Drug Kingpin Act has yielded few ‚Äú kingpins ‚Äù or major dealers , mostly ensnaring mid- to low-level minorities involved in the drug trade .
Opioids , including prescription opioids , heroin and synthetic drugs such as fentanyl , killed more than 42,000 people in the U.S. in 2016 , more than any other year on record , according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .
Trump has declared that fighting the epidemic is a priority for the administration , but critics say the effort has fallen short .
Last October , the president declared the crisis a national public health emergency , short of the national state of emergency sought by a presidential commission he put together to study the issue .
Trump called for a nationwide public awareness campaign , which he announced in October , to scare kids away from dabbling in drugs . He announced a new website , www.crisisnextdoor.gov , where members of the public can share stories about the dangers of opioid addiction .
Trump said the administration will work to cut the number of opioid prescriptions that are filled by one-third within three years .
The president also discussed how his policies , including a U.S.-Mexico border wall and punishing ‚Äú sanctuary ‚Äù cities that refuse to comply with federal immigration authorities , would help reduce the flow of drugs and help end the addiction epidemic .
Monday was Trump 's first visit as president to New Hampshire , which has long occupied a special place in his political rise . He captured his first Republican presidential primary here in 2016 , though he narrowly lost in the general election to Democrat Hillary Clinton .
Trump drew criticism last year after leaked transcripts of a telephone conversation with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto showed he had described New Hampshire as a ‚Äú drug-infested den. ‚Äù The Washington Post published the transcripts .
Though the 2020 election is more than 30 months away , early jockeying is already happening in states that play an outsized early role in choosing a party 's nominee . Retiring Sen. Jeff Flake , R-Ariz. , a persistent Trump critic , visited New Hampshire , which holds the nation 's first presidential primary , last week . He told Republicans someone needs to stop Trump ‚Äî and it could be him if no one steps up .
Meanwhile , the president 's daughter , White House senior adviser Ivanka Trump , spent Monday discussing infrastructure and workplace development in Iowa , which traditionally holds the first presidential nominating caucus .
Dakota Johnson and Bruce Dern have joined Shia LaBeouf in the adventure drama ‚Äú The Peanut Butter Falcon . ‚Äù
Newcomer Zachary Gottsagen , who is the inspiration for the film , will play the principal character of Zak in the movie , which will be directed by Tyler Nilson and Michael Schwartz from their own script .
Variety first reported in May that LaBeouf had come on board . The story follows Zak , a young man with Down syndrome , who runs away from the nursing home where he lives to pursue his dream of becoming a professional wrestler and attending the Saltwater Redneck wrestling school . Through circumstances beyond their control , a small-time outlaw also on the run ( to be played by LaBeouf ) becomes Zak 's unlikely coach and ally .
Armory Films ' Tim Zajaros and Christopher Lemole will produce and finance the film , alongside Bona Fide Productions ' Ron Yerxa , T-Bone Burnett , Lije Sarki , and David Thies . Burnett will also produce the soundtrack . Principal photography will commence on June 17 in Savannah , Ga .
Zajaros and Lemole said : ‚Äú Films like this are the reason why we got into the business . The script is absolutely incredible and the message so important , which should be apparent from the superb talent that the script has attracted . Tyler and Michael are extremely talented and we could n't be more excited to be working with them . ‚Äù
Johnson has starred in the two ‚Äú Fifty Shades of Grey ‚Äù films and will next be seen starring in Luca Guadagnino 's ‚Äú Suspiria. ‚Äù Dern received Academy Award nominations for his roles in ‚Äú Nebraska ‚Äù and ‚Äú Coming Home ‚Äù and has appeared in over 100 films . Burnett won an Academy Award for original song for ‚Äú Crazy Heart ‚Äù in 2009 .
Gottsagen lives with high-functioning Down syndrome , and became the inspiration for the movie after Nilson and Schwartz met him while working at a non-profit arts organization .
Johnson is represented by WME ; Dern is represented by Innovative Artists and Pure Arts ; Burnett is represented by L J Entertainment ; and Nilson , Schwartz and Sarki are represented by Management 360 and Bloom/Hergott .

PARIS : Johnny Sexton 's last-second drop goal earned Ireland a dramatic 15-13 away victory against France in their Six Nations opener as Les Bleus suffered an agonising defeat in coach Jacques Brunel 's first game in charge on Saturday .
Sexton 's 44-metre drop goal almost three minutes into injury time stunned the Stade de France as the hosts thought they would prevail after a splendid late try by wing Teddy Thomas .
But Sexton , who scored all his team 's points as he also slotted home four penalties , had other ideas .
France had stayed in contention thanks to Maxime Machenaud 's two penalties before Thomas 's dazzling run and Anthony Belleau 's conversion had put them ahead for the first time .
Les Bleus , who have not won in their last seven games , lost teenage sensation Matthieu Jalibert after the flyhalf suffered a knee injury in the first half .
Brunel , who took over from Guy Noves after a poor November series , banked on Jalibert to instil some life into the French team , but the 19-year-old limped off the field after half an hour .

Replacement scrumhalf Antoine Dupont was also injured .
`` We have to wait for the medical exams but it seems to be serious for Antoine Dupont , and possibly for Matthieu Jalibert , '' Brunel told a news conference .
France were penalised for offside early on and Sexton coolly slotted home the penalty as Ireland got off to a lively start .
The hosts were often pinned back to their own half with Connor Murray 's kicks proving tough to handle , but they enjoyed a good spell after 15 minutes as Jalibert showed a lot of pace .
But Ireland defended ferociously and never allowed Les Bleus into their 22 metres .
Another Sexton routine penalty earned Ireland a 6-0 lead .
Jalibert left the pitch to be replaced by Belleau on the half hour after hurting his knee .
Machenaud reduced the arrears five minutes before the interval with a penalty France won at the breakdown , only for Sexton to restore the six-point lead after a Sebastien Vahaamahina foul on Murray in the scrum .
The second rower was sanctioned again for offside and Sexton converted the resulting penalty to fatten up Ireland 's advantage , only for Machenaud to reply with a penalty .
France were still in contention after Sexton missed his first penalty of the night and Thomas scored the only try of an otherwise locked game .
Belleau converted to put France ahead but missed another penalty . Ireland pushed in the closing stages and Sexton fired a fine drop goal after a long spell of possession .
France travels to Scotland while Ireland host Italy next weekend .

When Jon Hamm was revealed to be the awful abductor who kept Kimmy and three other women imprisoned underground for 15 years on Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt , it was the best twist the show could have brought in its first season . So now that the finale season is upon us , will Jon Hamm be in season four of Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt ? He 's still a big part of the story , even if Kimmy has essentially moved on from the traumatic experience in her life .
As Variety reported ahead of the premiere of the first half of season four , Hamm was set to be one of the handful of beloved returning guest stars of the show . According to IMDB , Hamm will appear in just one episode of season four titled `` Party Monster : Scratching the Surface , '' which will be about Douglas , a.k.a . DJ Fingerblast , investigating what happened to his childhood idol , DJ Slizzard . And since Hamm 's character delved into music , as shown in his secret home movies , there 's a good chance that this will be a way for everything to come full circle . After seeing Hamm as a bearded and then clean shaven sociopath over the duration of the series so far , I also just want to see Hamm as a struggling DJ , because how amazing would that be ?
Since Hamm is probably going to be in just one episode of season four , the writers no doubt made it count and if he is going to be DJ Slizzard as well , then maybe this will give viewers a chance to see more about him before he became the terrible villain of Kimmy 's life . Aidy Bryant is also guest starring in the same episode as Tabby , his ex-girlfriend , so perhaps there will be some amazing flashback-heavy scenes . I do n't think Richard Wayne Gary Wayne could ever do or say anything to redeem himself , but at this point , Hamm 's portrayal of the character is honestly one of the main things I look forward to with the show .
The last time we saw the reverend , it was season two and he was calling Kimmy from prison to let her know that he wanted a divorce . Of course this came as a complete shock to Kimmy , and viewers , since it seemed impossible that any marriage to him would have been proven legal or legit in any way . But hey , this is TV . Later , his new wife-to-be , played by Laura Dern , showed up to have Kimmy sign the divorce papers . But since it 's been some time since Hamm has made an appearance on the show , it was only fitting that his character return one last time for the last season . Even though the reverend is terrible in every way , he 's also still a big part of the story since he 's part of Kimmy 's traumatizing past .
Co-creator Robert Carlock spoke to Variety about season four of Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt and where the story will go for Kimmy herself in regards to moving forward and growing up just a little bit . Because part of the charm of Kimmy is that she 's always maintained some of that innocent cheerfulness that makes her so unique . He said that the goal is `` Keeping Kimmy Kimmy while letting her move forward , '' while Ellie Kemper ( Kimmy ) added that Kimmy has plenty she still needs to work out in her own personal life .
I mean , after spending 15 years in a bunker and then trying to make it as a stunted adult in New York City , you ca n't really blame her for still having plenty to deal with . So hopefully Hamm 's return as the reverend will help Kimmy deal with some of those issues even further this season .
Could this be the start of further acquisition activity in the telecoms sector ? As a result , could a FTSE 250 sector peer be worth a closer look ?
Shares in CityFibre ( LSE : CITY ) , a provider of wholesale full fibre infrastructure in the UK , increased by 90 % on Tuesday after it became the subject of a bid approach . The company 's board has agreed the terms of a cash acquisition by Bidco . It consists of 81p per share in cash , which is a 92.9 % premium to the closing price of the company on the working day prior to the offer being announced .

Shares in CityFibre ( LSE : CITY ) , a provider of wholesale full fibre infrastructure in the UK , increased by 90 % on Tuesday after it became the subject of a bid approach . The company 's board has agreed the terms of a cash acquisition by Bidco . It consists of 81p per share in cash , which is a 92.9 % premium to the closing price of the company on the working day prior to the offer being announced .
Could this be the start of further acquisition activity in the telecoms sector ? As a result , could a FTSE 250 sector peer be worth a closer look ?
A done deal ?
But first , CityFibre . The board is recommending that shareholders accept the deal . Already Bidco has irrevocable undertakings and a letter of intent from 67.8 % of shareholders in the company . As such , the chances of it being concluded seem to be relatively high , and it would represent an all-time high valuation for the business . As such , the prospect of investors who are set to make a profit from the deal deciding to vote against it seems relatively low .
Improving outlook
Alongside news of the bid approach , CityFibre also released its full-year results . They showed a rise in revenue of 126 % , while gross profit moved 48.4 % higher . During the period , it was able to deliver on a ¬£201.8m fundraising which is being used to fund growth of the company 's full fibre network and to pay for the acquisition of Entanet .
However , the company 's net loss increased to ¬£16.6m from ¬£12.6m in the previous year . This shows that while it has the potential to become a highly profitable business in the long run , in the near term it may struggle to deliver a financially-appealing outlook . As such , the acquisition approach seems to be good news for the company 's investors .
Further bid activity ?
Also operating within the telecoms sector is FTSE 250-listed Talktalk ( LSE : TALK ) . The company has experienced a difficult period which has had a negative impact on its financial performance . However , it now seems to have found the right strategy under a refreshed leadership team , with the company 's bottom line forecast to rise by 62 % in the current year and by a further 20 % next year .
Despite such a strong rate of growth , Talktalk trades on a price-to-earnings growth ( PEG ) ratio of just 0.9 . This suggests that it could offer growth at a reasonable price . And since dividends per share are expected to increase by 78 % next year , it appears as though the company is optimistic about its investment outlook .
Certainly , the UK quad-play sector is becoming increasingly crowded and remains highly competitive . But with a strong position and the potential for further growth due to its focus on efficiency and customer service , it would be unsurprising for the company to become a takeover target over the medium term .
When I had my first baby , I was determined to be the `` perfect mom . '' I planned to breastfeed exclusively , use cloth diapers , and make my own organic baby-food , among other things . Then I became a mom , and my plans went right out the window . I felt like I had failed . After my second baby was born , I relaxed a little , combo-fed , ditched cloth diapers , and cut myself some serious slack . Then last year I had my youngest , and you guys , there are so many things that no one will tell you about having a third baby . It 's so completely different , in just about every way .
Maybe it 's because my life is completely different than it was when I had my first two kids . I now have a super supportive partner , and the relative luxury to be able to stay home with my son . Then again , I do n't think that 's entirely it . I think it 's because I 'm different , too . I am so much more relaxed , and less stressed out , and more than happy to fully embrace my status as a `` hot mess '' mom . I have also realized that loving your kids is the only thing that really matters . The rest ? The things that seemed so huge when I was a first-time mom ? Well , after having my third baby I 've realized that I was making mountains out of molehills .
My baby seems different , too . A mom of one I know recently joked that my youngest is a `` classic third child . '' I am pretty sure she was actually trying to imply that I 'm neglecting him by not touching him 24-hours a day . But , eh ? I mean , sorry I 'm not sorry . Because I 've realized that spending time away from my children is n't a bad thing . At all . My youngest is learning to do things for himself , and I am way less intense than I was as a first-time , and even a second-time , mom . I am pretty sure my chill is rubbing off on him , too , because he actually is a really happy baby , which is great , because I do n't think I could handle parenting a high-needs baby and my other kids , too .
So , if you are thinking about having a third baby , or already have one on the way , there are a few things you should know , including the following :
Your Third Pregnancy Is So Much Harder Giphy OMG pregnancy was so much harder the third time around . Between the exhaustion of pregnancy , hyperemesis gravidarum , and having to go on bed rest while simultaneously having to keep my older children alive and happy , it was the worst .
Labor Was Still Scary Even though I knew what labor was like , because I had had two babies before , also I knew that each childbirth experience might be completely different . So , yes , it was still scary . That 's why I did n't care about doing this `` naturally '' or earning some `` medal '' in the so-called labor and delivery olympics . Instead , I got an epidural before my induction started . 10/10 would recommend .
You 'll Take Way Better Care Of Yourself Postpartum Giphy I took way better care of myself this time , seeking help for postpartum depression and anxiety right away and talking to my doctor about birth control options as soon as possible . I also made sure I received physical therapy for the pain and incontinence I tried to ignore last time . Listen to your body , guys . It took me three pregnancies to learn that lesson .
Parenting Three Kids Is Easier Than Parenting Two Believe it or not , most of the time parenting three kids is actually easier than parenting two . My older kids are able to help with the baby , and they keep each other occupied most of the time . It 's actually awesome to see them play with each other . I mean , when they are n't fighting , that is .
It 's No Big Deal Giphy They say that when your kids are little , the days are long , but the years are short . It 's so true . I ca n't believe that my oldest child is about to turn 9 , and my youngest ‚Äî my baby ‚Äî is not really a baby anymore . Perhaps the most important lesson that I 've learned , though , is that the things that I thought were the biggest deals ‚Äî like breastfeeding , and being a perfect mom ‚Äî are so small in the grand scheme of things . I guarantee that no one can tell which of my kids breastfed the longest , ate only organic , and wore only cloth diapers .
You 'll Have Way Less Money Kids are expensive , you guys . There 's no getting around that . Fortunately , though , over the years I 've learned that there are so many items of baby gear that you just do n't need . Unfortunately , I 've also learned that different babies like different things . One baby might love that expensive swing and specific brand of bottle , but another might hate them . So , this time around , we only bought the bare minimum and waited to see what our baby would like once they got here .
Your House Will Never Be Clean Again Giphy You know those moms with the houses that always look perfect on Instagram and Facebook ? Yeah , I 'm not one of those moms . After having my third baby , I 've totally given up on trying to be perfect all of the time , and I simply do n't have the time or the energy to try , even if I wanted to . And I 've stopped trying to make my life perfect from the outside , too . Besides , it 's way more fun and way easier to be a hot mess mom that it is to clean my house 24 hours a day .
Your Plans Will Go Out The Proverbial Window My best laid plans for my third baby have totally fallen by the wayside . I planned to breastfeed , at least as much as I could . Turns out ? My baby has food allergies and has to drink special formula . I bought dozens of adorable cloth diapers . Guys , I love cloth diapers , but with three kids , two step-kids , three cats , and a tank full of fish , I just do n't have time to keep up with all the extra laundry . Fortunately , I 've also learned to cut myself some slack . I just wish I had learned that lesson the first time around .

101 Traces | The lone caretaker of Kochi 's centuries old Jewish synagogue
The caretaker of a 450-year-old Synagogue worries about the future of the Jewish community in Kochi . Joseph Elias Josephai ( affectionately known as Babu ) , is one of the few members of the Jewish community in Kochi who still remain in the city . After the formation of the state of Israel in 1948 , a large number of Cochin Jews ( also called Malabar Jews ) migrated back to the holy land . As a result , there are now as few as 27 Jews left in the city of Kochi . With no one to care for the Kadavumbhagom Synagogue , Babu has taken it upon himself to manage the security and upkeep of the Synagogue . Lamenting the future of the Jewish community in the city , Babu is looking to international Jewish trusts to help ensure that the Synagogue is maintained after his death .

Manchester United 's new signing Alexis Sanchez scored on his home debut in a 2-0 win over Huddersfield Town as they took advantage of a slip by cross-town rivals and Premier League leaders Manchester City on Saturday .
LONDON : Manchester United 's new signing Alexis Sanchez scored on his home debut in a 2-0 win over Huddersfield Town as they took advantage of a slip by cross-town rivals and Premier League leaders Manchester City on Saturday .
After City had been held 1-1 at Burnley , their daunting lead over United was reduced to 13 points when Jose Mourinho 's side eventually overcame a defensive Huddersfield side .
It took 55 minutes before Romelu Lukaku broke the deadlock after which Sanchez won a penalty , had it saved by Jonas Lossl , but tucked away the rebound in the 68th .
`` We had to be patient but had to keep the intensity high and the pressure , '' Mourinho told the BBC .
`` We had to break down the Berlin wall organised so well by David Wagner . ''
City paid the price for missed chances as they drew at Turf Moor with Johann Berg Gudmundsson 's 82nd-minute equaliser earning Burnley a point .

City had dominated possession but , after taking the lead with a fine strike from Brazilian Danilo in the 22nd minute , the visitors failed to press home their advantage .
`` We are frustrated in terms of the result but the performance was outstanding , '' said City manager Pep Guardiola .
City have 69 points , ahead of United on 56 with third-placed Liverpool ( 50 ) at home to Tottenham Hotspur ( 48 ) , who are fifth , on Sunday , while Chelsea ( 50 ) visit mid-table Watford on Monday .
Sixth-placed Arsenal ( 45 ) led Everton 4-0 at halftime and won 5-1 as Welsh international Aaron Ramsey scored the first hat-trick of his career . Record signing Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang was also among the scorers .
RELEGATION BATTLE
Huddersfield 's defeat at Old Trafford dropped them into the bottom three for the first time since they were promoted as Southampton and Swansea City both moved above them .
Bottom club West Bromwich Albion lost 3-2 at home to Southampton on an emotional day at the Hawthorns , where there was a minute 's applause for the home side 's former striker Cyrille Regis , who died aged 59 last month .
Albion led early on through Egyptian defender Ahmed Hegazi but were rocked by three goals in a quarter of an hour either side of halftime .
Southampton held on after Salomon Rondon 's goal to secure a first win in 13 league games , leaving Albion four points adrift at the bottom with 20 points .
Improving Swansea earned a valuable point with Federico Fernandez 's equaliser at Leicester City , for whom Jamie Vardy scored his 13th goal of the season in all competitions .
Bournemouth consolidated their place in the top 10 by coming from behind to beat Stoke City 2-1 and , on a good day for the south-coast sides , Brighton & Hove Albion beat West Ham United 3-1 to draw level with them on 27 points .

The 2017 Porsche Panamera is like a pair of nice but overpriced shoes . Once you stop considering all the other things that could have and maybe should have been bought with the same amount of money , it becomes more and more pleasurable .
Porsche expects this of its customers , and while the Audi RS7 or the Tesla Model S P100D may provide more bang for not as many bucks ( the Cadillac CTS-V is by far the best value of the large-performance sedans ) , the Porsche brand is more revered as the pedigree for performance . So $ 133,000 might not seem so out of line from a brand that fetches about $ 120,000 for its often imitated , never duplicated sports coupe known as the 911 .
While the Cayenne and Macan felt like crossover derivatives of the automotive world 's most recognizable icon , the first incarnation of the Panamera for 2010 looked like something else altogether . With its bulbous rear and hunchback roofline , Panamera looked more like an experiment than an extension of the 911 into four doors and four full seats .
This new shoe is a much better fit . It 's only an inch longer but in shortening the overhangs and stretching the wheelbase , and with the roofline curving more fluidly into the rear , it better harmonizes with the 911 .
The new 2.9-liter twin-turbo V-6 engine also supports the proposition in the 4S . It 's responsive without surging or lagging , and due to the compressed layout of the turbochargers as well as some magical action in the variable valve timing , the 440-horsepower engine is efficient under light loads and beastly under full throttle . It does n't feel like a sports car when you do n't want it to , instead cruising comfortably and quietly like a luxury sedan . Mash the pedal , though , and 405 foot-pounds of low-end torque comes with no lag and plenty of warbles as it hits 60 mph in 4 seconds ( 4.2 seconds without the sport chrono package ) . That 's 0.3 seconds faster than the old model .
The $ 6,930 sport chrono package features launch control , which literally took our breath away . Switch the controller on the steering wheel to sport plus mode , mash the brake , rev the engine for a second or two so there 's full torque , then let off the brake and hold on . The rocketing sensation is like the Tesla Model S but with engine noise .
The engine is mated to Porsche 's first-ever eight-speed PDK transmission , a dual-clutch setup derived from Porsche 's racing series and known for really quick shifts while maintaining relatively high rpm . But the eighth gear , much like its seventh-gear predecessor , is meant for greater fuel efficiency during highway cruising ; sixth gear is the highest gear when hammering it up to a top speed of 179 mph , 2 mph faster than the old one .
Inside , the cockpit has been streamlined so there are fewer buttons in the console , and a wider , more integrated touch screen . The touch screen is an improvement but the safety of a tabletlike interface in these distracted-driving times is questionable . Narrow buttons with drop-down menus on the left open as your hand approaches the screen , which is nice , but the icons are too small .
The annual Fairways for Football golf tournament brought friends and families together Saturday , Sept. 23 . The event took place at the Diamond Mountain Golf Course in Susanville .
Between the games of golf that were taking place on the course and the bidding wars and raffle prizes occurring in the clubhouse , the Lassen High School football booster fundraiser was declared a huge success .
Once all was said and done , the boosters raised approximately $ 5,000 for the Lassen High football team .
The event had a total of 10 teams of four players register and take to the course . Meanwhile , participants on a break or community members interested in the non-athletic aspects of the event could be found inside the clubhouse along with the many prizes donated by members and businesses of the community .
The winning team of the golf tournament included Jim Ernaga , Sam Porter , Greg Arnold and Frank Farris .
Ernaga , who is more than experienced in the sport , is the coach for both the boys ' and girls ' golf teams at Lassen High School .
‚Äú These are my golfing buddies , ‚Äù Ernaga said when warmly referring to his team . ‚Äú We 're just here to have fun and raise some money for our Grizzlies . ‚Äù
In addition to the overall tournament , the Fairways for Football event held the closest to the pin competition , of which James Luna won .
According to Lassen High football booster member Kristen Wilburn , the event was a great success and was fun for all who came out to participate .
The Lassen High football boosters fully intend to host another Fairways for Football fundraiser in fall of 2018 .
The boosters appreciated the support seen from the community and expressed their gratitude continually .
BANJA LUKA , Bosnia : The parliament of Bosnia 's autonomous Serb Republic approved a bill raising wages by up to 12.5 percent on Wednesday , violating terms agreed under a loan deal with the International Monetary Fund , in a move seen as a sweetener ahead of October elections .
Last week , the IMF Executive Board postponed at the last minute a meeting called to conclude a review of Bosnia 's loan programme which would unlock fresh aid , saying its staff needed more time to evaluate recent cabinet decisions to increase spending .

The lender 's move came after the Serb Republic government announced it would reduce income tax , raising net wages , while keeping overall pay unchanged , violating a deal with the lender under which it pledged not to increase salaries .
Bosnia 's other region , the Bosniak-Croat Federation , has also caused the IMF concern by planning to pass a law next week expanding the rights of veterans from the country 's war in the 1990s , a move that has not been agreed with the lender .
In a hastily called session , the deputies in the 83-seat Serb parliament approved the new income tax and wage bills with 44 lawmakers voting in favour . Opposition MPs left the session earlier over an unrelated dispute with the deputies from the ruling coalition .
Finance Minister Zoran Tegeltija denied that the terms of the IMF deal were violated , saying that payment allocations were changed only for employees that receive the lowest wages and who account for 1.1 percent of the total workforce in the region .

`` If I have to choose between the IMF and these workers , it 's clear what I will choose , '' Tegeltija told the parliament .
The bills will come into force in August .
The new spending legislation in Bosnia 's two regions is widely seen as part of campaigning by ruling parties ahead of the Oct. 7 parliamentary and presidential elections .

HONOLULU ‚Äì The FBI is investigating four Honolulu police officers who are accused of forcing a man to place his mouth on a urinal inside a public restroom .
Honolulu Police Chief Susan Ballard says another officer reported the suspected misconduct after the officers responded to a complaint Sunday of a person trespassing in the restroom .
Ballard says the department referred the case to the FBI on Wednesday following an initial internal investigation .

All four have been placed on restricted duty . They have not been identified .
According to the department , the officers have between three and 16 years of law enforcement experience .
Ballard says she is ‚Äú appalled at the behaviour , ‚Äù and the department will take appropriate action if the allegations are true .
India 's independence from British colonial rule coincided with the partition of the subcontinent into two separate countries , setting off unprecedented communal carnage on both sides of the hastily created border .
AMRITSAR , India : India 's independence from British colonial rule coincided with the partition of the subcontinent into two separate countries , setting off unprecedented communal carnage on both sides of the hastily created border .
A mass migration followed , marred by violence and bloodshed , as about 15 million Muslims , Hindus and Sikhs , fearing discrimination , swapped countries in an upheaval that cost more than a million lives .
During the chaotic transition , train cars full of bodies arrived at railway stations in the twin cities of Lahore and Amritsar in the province of Punjab , which was split roughly down the middle at partition on Aug. 14 , 1947 .
As India prepares to mark 70 years of independence on Aug. 15 , families who witnessed the death and destruction during partition recalled the tales of horror .
Brothers Santa and Niranjan Singh were lucky to survive the crossing from their village of Bhasin on the Pakistani side of the new border to their current home in Sarangra in India .
Santa , then aged 15 or 16 , says everyone was baying for blood . People were running around with knives , swords and guns .

Up to a dozen people from their village were killed in the madness , Santa recalls , saying they carried an injured brother across the border after he was shot through the head .
`` The bullet went in from one side and went out from the other side of his head , '' said Santa , reminiscing at a gathering of his extended family . `` We carried him all the way and he died after reaching this side . ''
His younger brother , Niranjan , was barely 5 years old but still remembers the sight of houses being burnt and people being massacred , and hearing stories of women and girls being raped .
Now the brothers live with their children and grandchildren , tending their lush green farmland located just three kilometres from the troubled border .
The separation based on borderlines created by the British at the end of their colonial rule came into effect at the stroke of midnight on the eve of Aug. 14 , 1947 .
India and Pakistan have fought three wars since 1947 , and relations remain tense , particularly when it comes to the disputed Himalayan region of Kashmir , which both claim in full but rule in parts .
Even as the rawness of the carnage that marked partition fades into history , the nuclear-armed neighbours re-enact their hostilities in ritual form in a colourful flag ceremony staged as the sun is setting over the Wagah border post that lies midway between Amritsar and Lahore .
Thousands of supporters from each country come to witness a parade of patriotism from their border guards who , in a mock confrontation , goose-step up to each other , stomp their feet and shout their lungs out during their daily retreat .
`` Amazing , amazing feeling about my country , about my army , '' said Phalguni Zaveri , who came from Mumbai with her husband Rahul to witness the parade .
`` I am so happy and obliged for making us feel safe . ''

A concrete wall in Sitio Bayanihan , Barangay Basak Pardo , Cebu City collapsed this morning .

Jaipur : Shree Rajput Karni Sena chief Lokendra Singh Kalvi on Saturday declared that his outfit is the `` real Karni Sena '' and that its protests against Sanjay Leela Bhansali 's `` Padmaavat '' would continue , even as a Karni Sena wing whose Mumbai faction had declared it was ending its protest , did a U-turn in the evening .
Sukhdev Gogamedi , national president of Shree Rashtriya Rajput Karni Sena , told reporters that `` Whoever saw the film on Friday , did so on personal basis and the person who wrote the letter ( ending the protest ) has been expelled . ''
He also said that his outfit has called an emergency meeting of office bearers to take a call on the film .
To a question about a sting operation of those who went to Delhi to see the film , Gogamedi said he will respond when the sting footage comes out .
Earlier in the day , Kalvi said that his group is the `` real Karni Sena ' , and it has made the BJP pay - via its loss in the Rajasthan bypolls - for not respecting the sentiments of the protesting Rajputs .
`` There are many fake Karni Senas emerging in India . At present there are eight such entities operating in the country with vested interests , '' Kalvi said .
The Rajput leader , whose group has been at the forefront of massive protests against `` Padmaavat '' , said there has been a `` duplicacy '' in matters pertaining to Karni Sena 's functioning . He stressed that there was `` only one Rajput Karni Sena operating in India and I proudly say that I am the founder of that organisation '' .
He also asked people to `` beware of such similarly named organisations functioning and operating in the market '' .
The Shree Rajput Karni Sena has been protesting the Deepika Padukone-starrer since its inception , claiming the film distorts history . `` We started the initial protests against the release of the film , which we still continue to do , '' he said .
`` However , the other duplicate Karni Senas are creating a dubious situation by releasing contradictory and fake news , '' Kalvi added .
On the Bharatiya Janata Party 's loss in the Rajasthan bypolls , the Rajput leader said : `` Around 17 organisations have joined hands and declared that they will make sure that BJP loses elections on each and every seat . ''
`` And we proved what we said . Congress won with a big margin while BJP was a loser on its home turf . ''
`` Jauhar ki jwala mein bahut kuchh jalega . Aur bhi bahut ghatnayen hongi ( The fire of Jauhar will burn down many things , there is more to come ) . 'Padmaavat ' will decide many things in future . ''
Kalvi said : `` We want the government to understand via political loss how it has hurt the sentiments of people here . ''
`` We have hit hard on notes as well as votes . Bhansali was expected to get Rs 500 crore return , however , we scuttled his dreams and cut the profit margin to Rs 150 crore .
`` Similarly , the vote share of the BJP was reduced , '' he added .
`` I have met 21 Chief Ministers and am I looking forward to meeting Prime Minister Narendra Modi soon . I have got the call from PMO asking about my schedule and have given them my schedule .
`` Will see when can I meet him and apprise him on the present situation , '' Kalvi added .
The Rajput leader strongly denied having any political aspirations . `` None of us have any dream of floating a political party , '' he said .
The Shree Rashtriya Rajput Karni Sena on Friday had announced that it had decided to end the protests against Bhansali 's `` Padmaavat '' stating that the film `` glorifies the valour of the Rajputs '' .
Shree Rashtriya Rajput Karni Sena 's Mumbai leader , Yogendra Singh Kartar said that a few members of the outfit watched the film on the directions of the organisation 's national President Gogamedi and found that the `` film glorifies '' the valour and sacrifice of Rajputs , and `` every Rajput would feel proud '' after watching it .
SINGAPORE : Tigerair will officially come under Scoot ‚Äì its sister budget airline under the Singapore Airlines Group ‚Äì on Jul 25 , the two airlines said in a news release on Thursday ( Jun 15 ) .
This marks the completion of the two carriers ' integration , a process which began in May last year , when they were brought under a common holding company , Budget Aviation .
The airlines will operate under a common licence or Air Operator 's Certificate , and consequently , the flight designator code for all Scoot flights will be changed from TZ to TR ‚Äì the code currently used for Tigerair flights .
All flight schedules , however , will remain unchanged .
Scoot 's website will also be the sole booking platform for all flights and existing Scoot-Tigerair check-in counters will also reflect the Scoot brand .

Just a friendly reminder this morning that 26 other major league baseball teams could , right now , have had not just the game 's best hitter statistically , but its most marketable young star by a mile-and-a-half .
But by the time the New York Yankees rolled the dice on a big , strong , raw slugger from Fresno State with the 32nd overall pick in the 2013 amateur draft , that 's how many teams looked at him and only saw the potential drawbacks .
Twenty-six .
Four of those teams ‚Äî the Pirates Rays , Rangers and Cardinals ‚Äî each took two players before Judge got selected , a consortium of Austin Meadowses and Reese McGuires and Ryne Staneks and Nick Ciuffos and Marco Gonzalezes and Rob Kaminskys and Travis Demerittes and Chi Chi Gonzalezes .
Guys like Meadows and Demeritte are pretty good prospects . Some are relief pitchers . Others are still trying to find their footing .
None are Judge , which is good for the Yankees , considering he is a very early candidate for the Triple Crown and , you know , sort of the future of sports ' biggest franchise .
‚ñ†‚ñ†‚ñ†
A common question I 've received since it began occurring to people that Judge 's assault on the American League in April has only intensified as June set in : During his time with the RailRiders in 2015 and 2016 , did it ever occur to you that this was possible ?
The short answer is no .
It never seemed possible . It never seemed likely . I thought Judge could someday be a very good player , someone who could hit for power and be a classic No . 5- or No . 6-in-the-lineup , all-or-nothing slugger . Someone who defended right field and ran the bases better than most people realized . Someone who is as classy a person as the Yankees say he is .
But an MVP candidate in 2017 ? No way . Only liars will tell you this .
He still is on pace to strike out about 180 times this season , which is a pretty good clip even by today 's more strikeout-understanding standard . But he 's like the fictional boxer Ivan Drago . Whatever he hits , he destroys .
Who 'd have predicted a .331 batting average and .448 OBP from a guy who frankly never approached those numbers over a full season in the minors .
When he played 155 games in the lower minors in 2014 , he hit .303 , with 21 homers , a .413 OBP and a .483 slugging percentage . That was his best minor league season by a considerable amount .
In his first season in the big leagues , he has 22 homers and 59 RBIs through 60 games . He 's hitting .331/.448/.714 . Those are massive , massive gains .
While Judge 's new , more advanced approach at the plate should be credited for most of that , it might be worth considering doing something that hardly seems fun , considering how he has battered opposing pitching over the last few weeks .
Maybe , it 's time for fans to temper their expectations , as far as what Judge can realistically provide the Yankees the rest of the season .
‚ñ†‚ñ†‚ñ†
He 's on pace for a Ruthian season . His numbers through his first 60 games are significantly better than Roger Maris ' through his first 60 games in 1961 ‚Äî .234/.337/.551 with 20 homers and 50 RBIs . And Maris had one of the best offensive seasons in history .
If Judge finishes the next 3¬Ω months with 40 homers and 100 RBIs , it will represent a Rookie of the Year season , and perhaps still an MVP run . But it will also come as a result of a much slower second half than he has had in the first , power-wise .
Probably not fair to expect more than that . But , a more-than-that pace is what Judge is on for three months . It 's why he has taken baseball by storm .
The game needs marketable , young talent like this , an everyman who looks like superman , carrying a team beloved ‚Äî and hated ‚Äî nationwide . He 'll be great theater in October . But fans still need to realize , he 's on a historic pace , and he 's still a kid .
And kids do n't often maintain historic paces .

There are no innocent people in politics .
That is an important truth to remember as herds of politicians rush to the moral high ground looking for a microphone .
Over the last few weeks , the political landscape shifted dramatically .
Federal Minister Kent Hehr , the PC leaders of Nova Scotia and Ontario , Jamie Baillie and Patrick Brown , and the president of the Ontario PC Party , former MP Rick Dykstra , have been forced to resign over allegations of misbehaviour .
Green Party leader Elizabeth May is under investigation for alleged bullying of staff .
The message is clear ‚Äî the power structures that once protected politicians from accountability for unprofessional conduct are crumbling .
This is hardly surprising . A system of government that dates back to 1848 is bound to have some difficulties fitting into the norms of the 21st century .
But changing the fundamental structures that allowed and sometimes encouraged misbehaviour is not something politicians are likely to embrace .
The collective hand-wringing over the last week gives proof to the notion that politics is more often the business of fixing the blame instead of fixing the problem .
Certainly Vic Fedeli ( my second favorite MPP from North Bay ‚Äì sorry , Vic ) can be forgiven for pushing behaviour issues to the back burner as he tries to right the PC ship .
The affable Fedeli has been handed the difficult task of presiding over the Ontario Progressive Conservative Party as interim leader .
He is the latest in a short list of people who have put the party and the province ahead of personal ambition . Good on him .
Fedeli has a couple of small problems .
In a scant five months , Ontarians will head to the polls .
In two months Ontario PC party members will vote for their next leader .
Somehow , inside of those deadlines , Fedeli and his team need to fix a database , establish a credible membership list and sort out issues surrounding the amount of cash available for the next election .
And , oh yeah , there are the small matters of building a team without a permanent leader in place and making campaign decisions that simply ca n't wait until after the leadership race .
Fedeli needs about a year to get all that done . He 's got two months .
First up is the membership list ‚Äì a crucial part of the leadership contest .
Most party membership lists are at least a little bogus . Suspect names get added during membership drives and leadership races . Most times you are lucky if 80 % of the names on the list are real supporters .
Rumour has it that the bloated OPCP membership list , most recently stated at 200,000 , is actually closer to 70,000 real members .
Getting the membership list vetted is job one for Fedeli .
Another looming issue is what to do with the recently released election platform , the People 's Guarantee .
Predictably , the leadership race will feature candidates attacking and defending various parts of the party 's own election platform .
That will have all the coherence of ‚Äî to borrow from Leonard Cohen ‚Äî a drunk in a midnight choir .
I have confidence that Fedeli will get the OPCP on the right track .
And ‚Äî however messy the process ‚Äî I do n't doubt that the party will be well lead heading into the June election .
But , given the distractions , I doubt that the burning issue of political misbehaviour is going to get resolved anytime soon , if at all .
Cleaning up politics is going to take more than feint shock and horror from our political leaders .
The elections into the 23 local government areas of Kaduna State will still hold as scheduled on 12th May , 2019 in spite of the inferno that occurred at the commission 's secretariat , the chairman Kaduna State Independent Electoral Commission ( KADSIECOM ) Dr ( Mrs ) Saratu Binta Dikko-Audu has disclosed .
Although , the chairman informed that some of the materials were destroyed in the inferno , she however stressed that the remaining Electronic Voting Machine ( EVM ) will be adequate for the election .
She also informed that the Smart Card Readers ( SCR ) will not be used for the election as earlier advertised because the Independent National Electoral Commission ( INEC ) said it wo n't be able to make 6,000 SCR available in view of the preparations for the 2019 general elections .
She said that the permanent voter 's cards ( PVCs ) would be used and verified through the voters ' register to be made available by the INEC .
She stated this during an emergency meeting between the SIECOM management , and stakeholders including chairmen and secretaries of political parties in the state .
On the inferno , she said the commission lost a lot of materials on the second floor of the buwilding due to the fire outbreak .
‚Äú We have taken stock of what we lost in the fire , we concluded that last night and are confident we have enough machines to conduct our elections .
‚Äú We want to remind you that the nomination forms your candidates filled are intact , but we lost the affidavit but we would give new forms during the screening of candidates , ‚Äù she informed .
The chairman also said that ‚Äú in view of that , the screening of candidates which was to commence on Tuesday April 24 , will now commence on Wednesday April 25 .
Qatar signed a deal with the US to buy a reported 36 F-15QA fighter jets for $ 12 billion on Wednesday , according to the country 's Ministry of Defence . It comes at a time when the Gulf nation is mired in one of the worst diplomatic crises in its recent past .
Qatar signs LOA for the purchase of the F-15QA fighter jets creating 60,000 new jobs in 42 states across the United States pic.twitter.com/tnOAC3KGma ‚Äî Meshal Hamad AlThani ( @ Amb_AlThani ) June 14 , 2017
What 's interesting is that the deal appears to have gone ahead despite US president Donald 's Trump 's scathing criticism of Qatar last week . In a statement delivered on Friday , the president accused Qatar of being a `` high-level '' sponsor of terrorism .
`` The nation of Qatar , unfortunately , has historically been a funder of terrorism at a very high level ... nations came together and spoke to me about confronting Qatar over its behaviour ... I decided , along with Secretary of State Rex Tillerson , our great generals and military people , the time had come to call on Qatar to end its funding ‚Äî they have to end that funding ‚Äî and its extremist ideology in terms of funding , '' Trump had said .
And under a week later , the deal for the fighter jets was signed .
At face value , this could appear to be a case of muddled or mixed foreign policy , but there 's more to it than meets the eye .
While the US and Saudi Arabia share warm diplomatic relations , something underscored by Trump in recent visit to West Asia , ties ( particularly defence relations ) between Doha and Washington have also been strong . First off , the sale of F-15QA jets , according to the Pentagon , will increase security cooperation and interoperability between the US and Qatar .
Additionally , Qatar is home to the Al Udeid Air Base , which is home to around 10,000 US troops . The base is widely referred to as Washington 's nerve centre in the battle against the Islamic State .
Saudi Arabia and other partners in the region who have blacklisted Qatar are yet to issue a comment on the fighter jet deal , but it appears as though the Trump administration has so far deftly managed to balance its relations with both Riyadh and Doha .
Whether this balance holds in the weeks to come , however , remains to be seen .

Harmanpreet scored 171 * against Australia in the semi-final More
‚Äã
What 's the story ?
Indian women 's T20 captain Harmanpreet Kaur was on Saturday felicitated by the Mumbai Cricket Association at the Garware Club House , where she recalled how former captain Diana Edulji motivated her to score big before the quarter-final against New Zealand and semi-final against Australia . Harmanpreet had scored only 77 runs in her first six games , the kind of performance not expected from a star player like her .
`` Before our match against New Zealand , Diana madam sent me a text message , asking me why I 'm in England and what I 'm doing in the team . Firstly , there were all sorts of thoughts running across my mind and to top it all , this message arrived . I did n't reply to her for the next two days . She then messaged again and asked , 'You are not replying ? ' I finally replied , saying 'Wait , we are coming with the Cup ' . She replied : 'Firstly , I need your fifty . ' I scored half-century against New Zealand in that match , '' recalled Harmanpreet .
The Punjab-born batter also regretted the fact that India fell short of only nine runs , and hoped she could have scored those nine runs .
`` Before our semi-final against Australia , Diana madam asked me , 'What now ? ' I told her , I am focusing on the Cup and I am not bothered about my game , but I will do my best . When I scored an unbeaten 171 in the next innings , she congratulated me by saying ' I am very happy ' . Even at that time I did n't reply , because I was thinking only about winning the final . Now , whenever we attend such felicitation functions , we all do a rewind and question ourselves why we could n't score those nine runs and that makes us feel sad . I wish I could score those nine runs , '' said Harmanpreet .
In case you did n't know
Harmanpreet Kaur scored a sensational unbeaten 171 against Australia in the semi-final . What stood out in her innings was that it came against the best bowling attack in women 's cricket , and despite the fact that Kaur was troubled by cramps in her legs .
The heart of the matter
India lost to England by nine runs in the finals at Lord 's . This was the second time they made it to the finals , the first time was in South Africa in 2005 , when they met Australia in the finals but lost .
Prior to the World Cup , the Eves had played a World Cup qualifier tournament to qualify for the quadrennial event . They became the only team in Women 's World Cup to beat Australia , England and New Zealand in a single edition . Mithali Raj was awarded the captain of the tournament .
What 's next ?
The BCCI is yet to announce the schedule for the women 's upcoming matches .
Author 's Take
Harmanpreet Kaur 's 171 against Australia got the whole of India to take interest in women 's cricket . She destroyed the Australian bowling attack , hitting them for boundaries all over the park . That innings are one to remember for a lifetime .

Safari Club International ( SCI ) will auction off hunt packages of 56 animals in Canada at its annual Las Vegas convention this weekend , valued at more than $ 444,000 CDN .
Some of the wild animals up for auction include wolves , moose , caribou , black bears , elk , coyotes , lynx , mink , wolverines and red stags .
Among the most expensive Canadian auction items are a 10-day British Columbia Roosevelt elk for one hunter , valued at $ 33,318 and an 11-day Yukon trophy moose or mountain caribou for one hunter and one non-hunter , valued around the same amount .
The Toronto Sun asked an animal activist about her thoughts on the auction as well as a spokesman from the Canadian branch of Safari Club International .
JUDY MALONE , FOUNDER OF TOURISTS AGAINST TROPHY HUNTING
‚Äú It 's shocking and I think the majority of Canadians would agree . We just saw in British Columbia a ban implemented on the trophy hunting of grizzly bears and both residents in B.C . and a poll across Canada show that there 's a huge of majority of Canadians very much opposed to killing our wildlife for trophy , for bragging rights , for wall mounts , rugs‚Ä¶for home decor , we kill our wildlife . ‚Äù
‚Äú We 're losing our Canadian wildlife at an alarming rate . We 're losing them because of habitat loss and climate change and regional over-hunting . But we still let these foreign hunters in here and resident hunters in here to kill them for gratuitous pleasure . ‚Äù
‚Äú Of all the pressures that are threatening our wildlife now , trophy hunting is something that can easily be taken off the table . There is no conversation benefit to it . They will lay claim there is . But it 's well documented there is not ‚Äî very little of the money from hunting permits or even the trips go into conservation of wildlife . ‚Äù
‚Äú It 's a very small group of people who can do this . They 're affluent people , they have the money to go around the world and pay huge sums of money to kill iconic wildlife . They get great pleasure out of it . We believe they 're psychopaths . They 're serial killers . ‚Äù
JASON ST. MICHAEL , SCI CANADA OPERATIONS MANAGER
‚Äú It 's a fact that hunting is a purist form of conservation , animals need to be managed and we 're able to raise money to ensure the wildlife is there for future generations . ‚Äù
St. Michael said they work with ‚Äú best available science , ‚Äù including deploying biologists and coordinating with the Ministry of Natural Resources in Ontario in projects . Millions of dollars every year go back into conservation programs from Safari Club International , he says . Last year , SCI spent $ 450,000 in projects throughout Canada , including a woodland caribou study and a grizzly bear study . ‚Äú That money is coming back and doing great things for Canadian wildlife . ‚Äù
‚Äú I would hesitate to use the word ‚Äò trophy . ' It 's become a derogatory statement because people have the wrong idea of what ‚Äò trophy hunting ' is . In Canada , there are very few animals that you could not utilize the entire animal . Predators such as wolf and coyotes , you do n't have to take the meat , everything else has to be utilized . Moose , deer , people have a misconception that hunters that pay money to go up there , they cut the horns and the head off and leave the rest of the animal there in the bushes . That is not the case . That is a fallacy that needs to be fought . ‚Äù

The biggest news in college basketball comes in August which is typically one of the quietest recruiting months of the year .
The nation 's No . 1 high school recruit Marvin Bagley III made his decision to reclassify up into the class of 2017 on Monday , which means he will immediately be a freshman in college basketball this season .
Along with his decision to reclassify Bagley said on SportsCenter that he will play his college basketball at Duke for Hall of Hame coach Mike Krzyzewski .
`` I would like to thank Danny Ferry and Coach K to allow wearing his retired number 35 at Duke University , '' Bagley said as he pulled out a blue Duke jersey out of bag on the Sportscenter set in Los Angeles , referring to the 1989 Naismith Award winner who played for the Blue Devils from 1985 through '89 .
The Bagley family has roots in Durham , North Carolina as Marvin 's father , Marvin Bagley Jr. , was born and raised in Durham and played football at North Carolina A & T .
Editor 's Picks Marvin Bagley just made it Duke and everyone else Marvin Bagley 's decision to play for Duke -- and to play for the Blue Devils this coming season -- shifts the college landscape . Arizona is good . Kansas is good . Michigan State is good . But Bagley 's choice has everyone looking up at Duke -- again .
ESPN 100 PG Tre Jones commits to Duke Tre Jones is hoping to carry Duke to the same heights his brother Tyus did during his time in Durham . Jones committed to the Blue Devils on Sunday , giving coach Mike Krzyzewski the country 's No . 4 point guard in the 2018 class . 1 Related
Bagley cited `` the brotherhood '' at Duke for helping sway his decision .
`` That 's what Coach K preached to me and my family on my visit , '' Bagley said . `` You know , I just had a good feeling there ever since they first offered me a scholarship in ninth grade . I 've always liked Duke . It 's a special place . And you have to be special to be a part of it . So I 'm just blessed . I thank God every day for allowing me to see schools like that and just be in a position to go to a place like that . So I 'm very thankful . ''
`` Marvin is a special kid , '' Bagley 's father said , appearing alongside him in Los Angeles . `` He 's fun ; you know he 's great with his brother . He 's a great role model . And it 's an honor to say I have a son such as Marvin . He 's just a special person -- outside of basketball . ''
Bagley Jr. said Duke was n't a decision he made for his son .
`` It was n't where I wanted him to go , it 's just where Marvin felt comfortable , '' Bagley Jr. said . `` You know , it was an extremely tough decision . Every school have everything lined up perfect . But in a case like this , you just got to go with your heart . And that 's where his heart is , at Duke , in the Bull City in Durham . ''
Bagley had been contemplating this decision for a long time , and began to explore immediate eligibility in recent months . He is now scheduled to graduate from Sierra Canyon High School in August at which point in time the NCAA Eligibility Center will review his final transcript to assess whether or not he has met all requirements to play at the Division I level .
Recently Bagley took official visits to Duke , USC , and UCLA . By choosing Duke he joins a six-man freshman class that includes five ESPN top 100 prospects . With Bagley headed to Durham along with their returning roster this instantly puts the Blue Devil 's in position to win the ACC regular season title and to become a legitimate final foul contender and to win a national championship .
The last time a No . 1 prospect reclassified up this late was Andre Drummond who was scheduled to enter college in 2012 . He committed to Connecticut in August 2011 . He finished the year at UConn leading the team in field goal percentage , rebounding and block shots . He then entered the NBA draft and was selected ninth in 2012 by the Detroit Pistons .
Bagley recently participated in the elite Drew Summer league in which he played along-side James Harden and Chris Paul and competed against NBA talent . In the All-Star game , he recorded a double-double by scoring 18 points and grabbing 20 rebounds . Bagley owns undeniable talent and untapped potential in the game . Left-handed and 6-foot-11 , he demonstrates extreme skill both on the interior and from the outside . He frequently recorded double-doubles and some triple-doubles .
Adding Bagley to the class of 2017 along with scoring savant Michael Porter Jr. and physically imposing big man Deandre Ayton , as well as newly reclassified No . 24 Jontay Porter ( Missouri ) , makes this class rival last year 's group that had historic one and done draft picks . The race for a national championship has changed with Bagley 's decision as Duke now can be considered a serious contender .
Bagley will now be the No . 1-ranked player in the class of 2017 and Duke will boast the No . 1 class . In the last four years Duke has landed the number one class three times and recently it 's their third No . 1 player to headed to Durham as No . 1 Harry Giles ( 2016 ) and No . 1 Jahlil Okafor ( 2014 ) also selected Duke .
As for now Zion Williamson will take over the top spot in 2018 until the rankings get updated the week of August 21 .
One of the most endearing qualities about model and actress Coco Austin is that she clearly * adores * being a mom . Fans can witness Austin 's love for motherhood on Instagram ‚Äî just about every photo on her feed is of her 2-and-a-half-year-old daughter , Chanel . Sadly , Austin 's desire to share her parenting journey with fans makes her vulnerable to criticism , and it 's a common occurrence for fans to lash out about her so-called mistakes as a mom . As for the latest controversy that has people fired up , it centers around a cute photo of Coco Austin and her daughter . Although the snap seems innocent at first glance , it 's inspiring a heated debate about breastfeeding . Buckle up , folks .
A lot of celebrity parents make it a point to draw awareness to the beauty of breastfeeding . Austin ‚Äî who has breastfed Chanel from the jump ‚Äî is no exception to this awesome trend . `` I follow some mother empowering pages here on Instagram and I love the inspiring pics they post showing the tenderness and love between a mother and child with or without nursing moments , '' Austin captioned a shot uploaded to Instagram on Tuesday of Chanel resting on her breasts , according to Instagram . `` Love that I can be a part of that . @ babychanelnicole has made me a more sensitive person now that I 'm older . ''
Sweet , right ? It 's obvious Austin and Chanel share a deep bond .
Adorableness aside , it seems like some people are preoccupied with Austin 's nursing habits . Following Austin 's admission in the comments section that she still breastfeeds Chanel for `` comfort , '' fans openly critiqued her decision .
`` Disgusting . Breastfeeding from birth to 1 year I understand but beyond that it becomes very strange , '' someone argued , according to Instagram . `` Gon na have a 5 or 16 year old still feeding for comfort . # grossbro . ''
Another person advised :
Once it turns to comfort that 's when it 's time to wean her off . Breastfeeding is mainly for the purpose of nutrition and passing on the immune antibodies to your baby and of course you also gain a connection with your baby and that 's great but once the baby is old enough to have solid foods they no longer need the nutrition that breast milk offers so it 's okay to wean them off .
In response to the above comment , another person chimed in : `` Thank you for saying something . Medical school teaches this and at some point it does become unhealthy mentally for the baby . Do what you want but y'all gon na end up with a 13 year old still wanting to nurse . Lol . ''
Others took jabs at Austin for her so-called inappropriateness .
`` You really need a separate nursing page one minute people are looking at sexual a * s and tit poses , '' one person penned . `` Then another minute you got these same people watching you breastfeed your kid . Your kids face should n't be on the same wall with those type of pictures . ''
`` It 's a tender moment but what about the previous picture coco posted of herself showing all her butt crack ? '' a fan asked . `` She enjoys putting her sexuality out there . ''
Of course , there 's nothing sexual about Austin 's post . Secondly , Austin 's sexuality does n't compromise her parenting , and it does n't jeopardize Chanel 's well-being . Austin can express her sexuality and be a mom at the same time , haters .
As for the comment that breastfeeding is strictly for nutritional purposes , I have a feeling many parents will disagree with that sentiment . Not to mention , a study published in Pediatrics found that breastfeeding is an effective tool in lessening a child 's pain . So , if your child has a minor accident , breastfeeding is more soothing than giving them a pacifier , for instance . This finding proves that there is more to breastfeeding than just nutrients . ‚Äú Babies go to the breast for many reasons ‚Äî they 're hungry or thirsty , they 're tired , they 're scared or hurt , they 're feeling overwhelmed , '' lactation consultant Fleur Bickford told Today 's Parent . `` All of these are equally valid reasons for a baby to nurse . ''
Luckily , other fans have Austin 's back in this debate .
`` Priceless bond between mommy and child ! Her mommy 's milk is the best gift a mother can give to her child , '' someone else said . `` Benefits continue for the child and mommy as they continue to grow . Thank you for normalizing breastfeeding . ''
`` This is so sweet , @ coco , '' a fan gushed . `` These are the moments you wo n't ever get back . Still nursing my 21 month old too and it is helping us through teething , sickness and provides comfort like no other . Love you ! ''
Another person chimed in :
You are such an inspiration to Moms everywhere . As a Grandma , I 'm thankful for you and other celebrity moms sharing their breastfeeding experiences publicly . I wish there had been these role models and resources when I breastfed and was shamed 30 and 40 years ago . Kudos !
And on the topic of Austin 's sexuality , a commenter wrote :
Part of what makes her empowering is she is both a mother and owns her sexuality . There is a stigma that once a woman has children her body is not her own . A woman has the right to choose when and if her body is sexualized and no one should be shamed for that .
The main takeaway here is that there is no wrong or right way to feed or comfort your child . Each parent can decide what 's best for their kid , and no one ‚Äî including Austin ‚Äî deserves to face criticism for these personal choices . To each their own , right ?
SEOUL : South Korea will downgrade its bird flu alert level by one notch from the highest level starting from Wednesday as no new cases have been reported for about two weeks , the country 's agriculture ministry said on Tuesday .

The Ministry of Agriculture , Food and Rural affairs said in a statement that bird flu is likely to abate , with no new cases found since April 4 .
The ministry said it will keep disinfecting farms and stay vigilant until the country becomes bird flu-free .

ISLAMABAD - Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi said on Tuesday that the outgoing Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz government had successfully overcome the monstrous challenge of power crisis and added up to 11,461 megawatts of electricity to the national grid .
Addressing a press conference here , the premier sought an open debate with those leveling allegations about the LNG deal with Qatar and said that had these agreements of LNG import not been materialized , the people would have been experiencing eight to 10 hours load-shedding now .
Flanked by Minister for Power Awais Leghari and Information Minister Marriyum Aurangzeb to present his government 's performance in the energy sector , Premier Abbasis said that the country 's power generation capacity has increased from 18,753 MW in 2013 to 28,704 MW this year .
The prime minister said that LNG-based power plants were the most efficient power units in the country as 6745 MW were being generated by them .
To a question , the prime minister said that he did not see any prospect of PTI chief Imran Khan 's becoming the future premier .
He said he himself and his ministers were responsible for their actions and were accountable . Due to legal proceedings and the NAB , bureaucrats were not willing to work , he said .
He also credited former premier Nawaz Sharif for providing them a leadership and smoothly overcoming power issues .
To another question , he said provinces should also come forward and share their responsibilities with regard to energy issues . He said the federal government was ready to hand over power to provinces after its generation and gas supply and they should manage it . He regretted that PESCO was facing 60 percent power losses .
About Pak-India water dispute , the prime minister said the World Bank was mediating over the issue and the dialogue was still continuing .
About the Financial Action Task Force ( FATF ) upcoming meeting , the prime minister said Pakistan had to submit a compliance report . The FATF had pointed out deficiencies which were also addressed and it was expected that the body would appreciate our narrative in its next meeting .
Earlier , giving details about the power generation and the comparison in the power supply and demand when they took over the government in 2013 , the prime minister said in July 2013 , 9.9 billion units were produced , whereas in July this year , the actual production will rise to 14.6 billion units , showing an increase of 4.75 billion units .
Abbasi said the situation of electricity availability during this Ramazan was much better than the previous year . He said there was zero load-shedding in 90 percent areas during the peak hours .
He said two to four hours load-shedding was being observed in the 10 percent feeders where power theft and high line losses were reported .
The prime minister said that a minor shortfall of about 362 MW was likely to be faced next month . He said the demand was expected to be 22,538 MW and generation 22,175 MW . He said in July , there will be a shortfall of about 403 MW . He said this shortfall was expected due to a decrease in water supply . He said after July , the country will have surplus energy .
The prime minister said that the government has addressed the electricity issue keeping in view the future demand . He said 10,687 MW will be added to the national grid in the next three years , while another 17,119 MW will be generated in the following five years . He said that the government has initiated projects to meet the country 's energy demand till 2025 .
The prime minister said the fluctuation in the hydel power production was linked to the availability and flow of water . The water shortage could affect the power generation in addition to technical reasons , he said .
With the onset of the summer season , the water flow this year was recorded 60 percent less than compared to the previous year .
In April 2013 , a total of 5,099MW was generated whereas in the same period of 2018 , 3,090MW could be generated due to the shortage of water and 3000 MW shortfall from hydel power was recorded this year .
The prime minister said that during the next five years , about 17,000 MW would be added to the national grid . The next government should give consideration to the issue , he added .
He said in the country 's history for the first time , the national consensus was reached and the first water policy was approved by the Council of Common Interest ( CCI ) .
To a query , he maintained that a national dialogue and consensus should be held on construction of certain water reservoirs .
He said the power distribution system faced a challenge but the NTDC had spent a huge amount to mend it whereas a Chinese company was also working on it .
Abbasi defends LNG deals with Qatar
It 's been almost two months since Jinger Duggar married Jeremy Vuolo in a small ceremony attended by a couple thousand of their closest friends .
Given her family 's obsession with procreation it 's not surprising that the rumors about Jinger being pregnant began almost immediately after she got hitched .
Surprisingly , however , we 're still waiting on an official announcement .
No non-Duggar would be expected to start a family so soon after getting hitched , but Jinger and her siblings have been taught from a young age that sole purpose of human life is to create more human life .
Just before the holidays , Jinger celebrated her 23rd birthday , and many fans seemed convinced that she would make the occasion extra special by announcing that she 's expecting her first child .
Jeremy added fuel to the fire by hinting at some sort of big reveal on Jinger 's big day .
It seems the surprise he was referring to was a trip to the opera for Jinger , who has a reputation for being the most artsy and sophisticated member of the massive Duggar brood :
Jeremy posted the pic above with a caption reading , ‚Äú Enjoying Jinger 's birthday gift together ! ‚Äù

You knew it . You knew something was off with Carson Wentz after he dove into the end zone for a touchdown that ultimately was erased by a penalty .
The Philadelphia Eagles ' sensational second-year quarterback actually stayed in the game vs. the Los Angeles Rams -- the biggest bout of the NFL season thus far -- and threw his fourth touchdown pass . Because that 's what Carson Wentz does . But when you saw Wentz go into the medical tent , you knew . And when he walked off the field , you knew . And when he was quickly ruled out for the game , you really knew .
Wentz is done for the season with an ACL tear .
And even though I was bracing for it , I immediately felt sick when the ACL reports first materialized on Sunday . Still do . Wentz is everything that 's right about the NFL . In just his second NFL season , the former North Dakota State star had emerged as one of the most exciting players in the NFL at age 24 . With a league-best 33 touchdown passes , an adventurous playing style and leadership skills beyond his years , Wentz seemed poised to lead the Eagles to Super Bowl LII . Philadelphia was the best team in the NFC . In fact , I had Philly as the best team in the entire NFL . And yes , Wentz was in line to receive my Associated Press MVP vote .
Now , Wentz is the latest high-profile player to be lost to injury in this seemingly cursed season . I ca n't imagine what Eagles fans are going through . From sheer , season-long jubilation to sudden , pure agony . Gutted . Destroyed . Torn apart . This is the downside of sports fandom , when an exhilarating campaign is abruptly spoiled by a cruel twist of fate . The fact that the Eagles actually ended up winning Sunday 's highly anticipated showdown , 43-35 , becomes immaterial .
The 11-2 Eagles still have a great defense , one that leads the NFL in rushing D and ranks in the top 10 of numerous other categories . And QB Nick Foles actually has experience leading the Eagles to the playoffs . ( Remember that 2013 season , when Foles racked up 27 TD passes against just two picks ? ) Philadelphia is currently the No . 1 seed , having clinched the NFC East on Sunday .
But while the backup QB looked solid in relief during Sunday 's win , it 's impossible to see the Foles-led Eagles making a deep playoff run . Foles ' 2013 campaign is the outlier in an otherwise-underwhelming NFL career . And with the way this team played over the first three months of this season , the bar was set : Super Bowl or bust . On Sunday , Philadelphia went bust . Carson Wentz made these Eagles . Just ask Philly LB Nigel Bradham .
`` I mean , he 's everything to us , '' Bradham said in the postgame , per The News Journal . `` It 's definitely a hurting feeling . ''
The NFC is absolutely loaded . Yet , each team has its flaws . On Sunday , the Vikings -- and notably , Case Keenum ( two picks ) -- came back to Earth after playing next-level football for two months . It was Carolina who snapped Minnesota 's eight-game winning streak , and the Panthers deserve immense credit for the win . But if you 've watched this team on a weekly basis , you know it 's tough to trust Carolina . In the two weeks prior to Sunday 's big win , the Panthers squeaked by the Jets and were thoroughly outclassed by the Saints . Speaking of New Orleans , that team is so tough and well-rounded . But injuries are starting to take their toll , with a bevy of Saints going down in last Thursday 's loss to Atlanta . Those Falcons are loaded with talent , but they just have n't looked the same as last season . I 'm a big fan of Sean McVay 's upstart Rams , but do they have enough experience to make the Super Bowl ? Can they hold off Seattle in the NFC West ? On the latter question : I think they can and will , as I do n't believe in the Seahawks , other than Russell Wilson . On the former question : Not so sure .
When it comes to the current NFC playoff teams , I think the Saints and Rams have the best opportunity to capitalize on the Eagles ' awful misfortune . But there is one other team , presently on the outside looking in , that could wind up being the scariest team in the entire NFC postseason field .
In an NFL season marred by a galaxy of injured stars , would n't it be rather ironic if Aaron Rodgers were to return this week -- the week after Wentz went down -- and lead the 7-6 Packers on another magical run ? With extreme empathy for the passionate Eagles backers , this is the jolt NFL fans need after watching an MVP hopeful go down . It 's time for Rodgers to remind the world , in case everyone forgot , that he 's the Michael Jordan of today 's NFL -- one man who can completely change the balance of power in an entire league .
This is certainly a possibility I 've been eyeing . Following Green Bay 's loss to Pittsburgh in Week 12 , I thought the Packers could still run the table and finish the season at 10-6 and sneak into the playoffs . So far , so good . Yes , Green Bay needed a furious comeback to force overtime and eventually escape Cleveland with a victory over the winless Browns , but a win 's a win , especially when you 're rolling with your backup . That saved the season and kept the dream alive . Brett Hundley and the receivers came through . Clay Matthews stepped up . It had to happen .
If the Packers had lost , it might not be worth bringing Rodgers back less than two months after collarbone surgery . But now , the stage is set for Rodgers , who 's eligible to return from injured reserve this week , to toss on his Superman cape and save the season . Football fans need Aaron Rodgers playing like Aaron Rodgers . Opposing coaches do n't exactly share that sentiment , as the Rodgers-led Pack would be the team no one wants to face in the postseason .
The skeptic could say the task is daunting , even for Rodgers . Green Bay 's remaining schedule is far from easy : at Carolina , vs. Minnesota , at Detroit . Well , I 'd like to respond to the naysayers by quoting a great philosopher : R-E-L-A-X .
Carolina has won a lot of games , but -- like I said above -- these Panthers certainly do n't give off a world-beater vibe . Case Keenum vs. Aaron Rodgers ? I 'll take No . 12 . And Jim Caldwell 's Lions are hanging on by a thread .
Yes , the Packers have issues of their own . Ted Thompson did n't give Rodgers requisite talent and the defensive backfield is all banged-up . But Aaron Rodgers is the ultimate deodorant . If he can indeed return to action this week , are you really going to bet against him ?
Sunday was awful for the Eagles -- and the NFL , as a whole . I felt like I was punched in the gut with the Wentz news . It was the same feeling I got when Deshaun Watson went down . And when Rodgers snapped his collarbone in Week 6 .
But if that collarbone checks out in a CT scan this week , Rodgers will have the opportunity to take us on another thrill ride deep into the new year . And in a season that 's seen way too many superstars shelved by injury , this is the kind of fairy tale climax we all need .

The beef just got bigger : Pusha T claimed in a new song that Drake has a love child named Adonis with an ex-porn star .
In ‚Äú The Story of Adidon , ‚Äù which dropped Tuesday night , the G.O.O.D Music rapper alleges that Drake , 31 , fathered a son with a former adult actress named Sophie Brussaux .
Drake was photographed with Brussaux in January 2017 . In May 2017 , she claimed she was pregnant with his child , TMZ reported , and alleged that he urged her to have an abortion .
At the time , Drake 's rep told TMZ , ‚Äú This woman has a very questionable background . She has admitted to having multiple relationships . We understand she may have problems getting into the United States . She 's one of many women claiming he got them pregnant . If it is in fact Drake 's child , which he does not believe , he would do the right thing by the child . ‚Äù
A source close to Drake voiced serious doubts to Page Six that he was the father of Brussaux 's child , but said that if he was , he 'd step up for the child .
Pusha referenced the scandal in his track .
‚Äú Since you name-dropped my fianc√©e / Let 'em know who you chose as your Beyonc√© / Sophie knows better , ask your baby mother / Cleaned her up for IG , but the stench is on her / A baby 's involved , it 's deeper than rap / We 're talkin ' character , let me keep with the facts / You are hidin ' a child , let that boy come home / Deadbeat motherf‚Äîker playin ' border patrol , ‚Äù Pusha raps in the song . ‚Äú Adonis is your son / And he deserves more than an Adidas press run , that 's real / Love that baby , respect that girl / Forget she 's a porn star , let her be your world . ‚Äù
Brussaux 's Instagram account has since been made private ( perhaps what Pusha referenced with ‚Äú cleaned her up for IG ‚Äù ) , though a fan account has posted several photos that were on her page previously , including one of her showing off her bump at her baby shower .
A post shared by Sophie Brussaux ( @ sophiebrussaux ) on Oct 19 , 2017 at 9:21am PDT
The diss track is just the latest in a war of words between the rappers .
In Pusha T 's track ‚Äú Infrared ‚Äù off his album ‚Äú Daytona , ‚Äù released Friday , he resurrected rumors that Drake uses ghostwriter Quentin Miller , rapping , ‚Äú The lyric pennin ' equal the Trumps winnin'/ The bigger question is how the Russians did it / It was written like Nas , but it came from Quentin . ‚Äù
Drake retaliated with the instantly viral ‚Äú Duppy Freestyle ‚Äù on Friday , in which he references Pusha T 's engagement to Virginia Williams as well as Kanye West , who produced much of ‚Äú Daytona . ‚Äù
Pusha told ‚Äú Ebro in the Morning ‚Äù last week that his feud with Drake began after Drake questioned his past as an alleged drug dealer in his track ‚Äú Two Birds , One Stone . ‚Äù
‚Äú A lot of talk about the record , or whatever the case may be ‚Ä¶ I guess , just speaking his truth , questioning my validity to the streets and so on and so forth within that verse , ‚Äù Pusha said . ‚Äú It 's fine . That 's what it was . But if we 're gon na question things , it 's my turn to question . ‚Äù
A rep for Drake declined to comment on his potential paternity .
( CNN ) ‚Äì The New England Patriots are looking for a sixth title on Sunday when they face the Philadelphia Eagles in Super Bowl LII . That would tie the Pittsburgh Steelers for most Super Bowl wins .
Have n't bought your ticket yet ? The cheapest ones left cost nearly $ 3,000 , according to StubHub .
Tickets on the site were up 31 % compared to the cost of last year 's Super Bowl two days out .
The average cost of attendance for Sunday 's game is also up over last year from $ 3,967 to $ 5,309 on StubHub .
This year 's tickets are the second most expensive ever . Only tickets to Super Bowl XLIX in 2015 cost more . That year the average was an astronomical $ 9,500 . But prices were out of whack because rampant ticket speculation by resellers inflated prices .
The increased prices are n't unique to StubHub . It 's expensive on other sites that list resale prices .
On TicketIQ , the cheapest ticket costs $ 3,210 . TicketCity had seats available in the uppermost level for $ 2,814 .
These prices will likely fall as the game gets closer .

WASHINGTON , D.C. ( AP ) ‚Äì President Donald Trump is making a surprise visit to MedStar Washington Hospital Center , where Rep. Steve Scalise is being treated for his injuries following Wednesday 's shooting at a Republican congressional baseball practice .
Scalise is still in critical condition Wednesday night and will need more operations after shooting .
The president and first lady Melania Trump brought two bouquets of white flowers to the hospital .
MedStar Washington said in a tweet Wednesday afternoon that Scalise ‚Äú was critically injured and remains in critical condition. ‚Äù It provided no further details about him .
Scalise was among several people wounded when a rifle-wielding attacker fired on lawmakers on a baseball field in Alexandria , Virginia , outside Washington . The attacker was shot and later died .
Vice President Mike Pence has been speaking with the victims of Wednesday morning 's attack on a Congressional Republican baseball practice .
Pence 's office says he spoke with the two injured members of the U.S. Capitol Police , as well as the father of lobbyist Matt Mika , who was shot multiple times .
Pence also touched base with the Capitol Police chief and a number of lawmakers , including Rep. Roger Williams of Texas . Williams said at a press conference that Pence had spoken with his injured staffer , Zachary Barth .
The White House said shortly after the shooting that President Donald Trump had spoken with House Speaker Paul Ryan , Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell , injured Rep. Steve Scalise 's wife and chief of staff , and the chief of the Capitol Police .
Family members of Matt Mika says he suffered multiple gunshot wounds and remains in the intensive care unit in critical condition after surgery .
Mika was wounded Wednesday when a gunman opened fire at a baseball practice , injuring a congressman and others .
His family said in a statement late Wednesday that they expect Mika to remain hospitalized for at least several days . The family said , ‚Äú we continue to be in disbelief that he would be part of this heinous attack . ‚Äù
Mika is a former aide to Michigan Republican congressman Tim Walberg . He is director of government relations for Tyson Foods Washington , D.C. , office and has worked for the company for more than six years .
Mika 's family described him as ‚Äú a very thoughtful , fun-loving person who is competitive and loyal ; all things which contributed to his continued commitment to the Congressional Baseball Game . ‚Äù

This statement was originally published on ipi.media on 19 March 2018 .
The International Press Institute ( IPI ) today strongly condemned a three-year suspended prison sentence and journalism ban given to Slovak journalist Luk√°≈° Milan on criminal defamation charges .
The verdict comes amidst a national political crisis in Slovakia following the murder of investigative journalist J√°n Kuciak in February 2018 . Like Kuciak , Milan was investigating alleged corruption linked to politicians with Slovakia 's ruling Smer party .
IPI Deputy Director Scott Griffen said the ruling violated international principles on freedom of expression .
`` Numerous international human rights bodies , including the U.N. Human Rights Committee and the European Court of Human Rights , have established that imprisonment - even in the form of a suspended sentence - is not a proportionate penalty for defamation , '' Griffen said . `` Disproportionate rulings such as the one in Mr. Milan 's case have the potential to chill investigative journalism in Slovakia , even more so in the wake of J√°n Kuciak 's murder . ''
`` This ruling should be overturned on appeal , and Slovakia should urgently bring its defamation laws in line with international standards , in particular by repealing all forms of criminal defamation . ''
Article investigated bribery involving Smer official
The charges were based on a 2015 article Milan wrote on the Slovak health care system to Plus 7 Dn√≠ weekly . In an interview with IPI , Milan said that as part of the story he was looking into various contracts in the local health care system made by Pavol Pa≈°ka , a former speaker of the Slovak parliament and a prominent figure in the Smer party .
Milan met with a young transport entrepreneur who claimed Pa≈°ka had asked for bribes so that the entrepreneur could take on a blood plasma transport business for hospitals . The entrepreneur told Milan that when he had gone to a hospital to negotiate on the transport business , staff there directed him to Pa≈°ka , as the latter was `` in charge '' of all the business .
The entrepreneur alleged that in an ensuring meeting , Pa≈°ka asked the entrepreneur to pay 5,000 euros per month to his company in exchange for a contract with the hospital .
`` The entrepreneur did n't take the deal because it was not profitable , '' Milan told IPI .
The source 's claims are behind Pa≈°ka 's libel case against Milan . The young entrepreneur has requested to remain anonymous in order to protect his business . He has not come forward to the authorities and Milan has refused to reveal his identity .
Pa≈°ka has denied the bribery allegations and claimed that Milan 's story harmed his family relationships and damaged his business . However , according to Milan , records show that business at Pa≈°ka 's company has actually improved after the article .
Additionally , police have not investigated the allegations contained in the article , a fact Milan described as `` normal '' in Slovakia due to a close connection between politicians and the justice system . Police initially dropped the libel investigation before taking it up again following a prosecutor 's order . `` Pa≈°ka is a very influential man in Ko≈°ice , and there is a connection with Pa≈°ka and the Ko≈°ice court , '' Milan alleged . `` The system in Slovakia is like that : Politicians use police and prosecution against their enemies . ''
Anger at a perceived `` corrupt system '' in Slovakia has grown in the weeks following the murder of Milan 's former colleague Kuciak .
`` Police shut their eyes when they are told to do so , '' Milan said . `` Until Kuciak 's case , the system was hidden . Now it is revealed . ''
Ban on 'practicing journalism '
Milan 's sentence includes a seeming absurdist three-year ban on practicing journalism . Slovak law does not define `` journalism '' and Milan has not received any further details on what the ban actually entails . Since January , Milan has worked as a spokesperson for the city of ≈Ωilina .
`` Should I be quiet , am I not allowed to ask any questions , can I upload pictures on social media ? '' Milan asked . `` These are all things that a journalist does . Am I now not allowed to do them ? Nobody can define journalism . ''
In addition , Milan was sentenced to either 18 months of prison or 36 months in probation . The sentences are longer than one would get for a hit-and-run case , he said .
Milan has filed an appeal to the ruling . The next court session is due in May .
`` I will go through all the possible measures to prove that I am right , '' Milan said .
In the meantime , he is focusing on his new job and his newborn child . `` I 'd rather spend time with my baby than think about going to jail . ''

Christine Cromer walks through security at the Luzerne County Courthouse Friday morning . Mark Moran cv03cromerp2 MARK MORAN / STAFF PHOTOGRAPHER Christine Cromer walks through security at the Luzerne County Courthouse on Friday morning .
WILKES-BARRE ‚Äî The preliminary hearing for a Plains Twp . woman alleged to have falsely accused two state police troopers of rape was derailed Friday morning when tempers flared between her attorney and the presiding magistrate .
Christine A. Cromer , 37 , of 237 Maffett St. , is facing charges of filing false reports and unsworn falsification alleging she implicated two troopers in a sexual assault outside Mohegan Sun Pocono ‚Äî attacks police say never happened .
In court Friday morning , Cromer 's preliminary hearing fell apart after state police Cpl . Rebecca Warner testified that Cromer gave police inconsistent statements about whether she had consensual sex with Trooper Robert Covington , a Bureau of Gaming Enforcement officer , prior to the alleged assault at the casino in November 2016 .
When defense attorney Joseph F. Sklarosky Sr. went to cross-examine Warner , Assistant District Attorney Angela Sperrazza objected to several of his questions in a row . The prosecutor argued that Sklarosky 's inquiry about a state police internal affairs investigation went beyond the scope of her examination and that a question about why troopers think Cromer is lying is a matter for a jury to decide .
Magisterial District Judge Thomas F. Malloy Sr. sustained Sperrazza 's objections , causing Sklarosky to question why he was even present at the hearing .
‚Äú All I want is a level playing field , ‚Äù Sklarosky said .
Malloy responded that if Sklarosky felt he was being treated unfairly , Malloy would recuse himself from the case . Sklarosky immediately took him up on the offer .
‚Äú It 's pretty obvious I should be able to ask some questions , ‚Äù Sklarosky said .
‚Äú Nobody is stopping you from asking questions , ‚Äù Malloy said . ‚Äú It 's just the way they 're being asked . ‚Äù
But Sperrazza put the brakes on an immediate recusal , requesting a formal motion to be filed in writing with the courts before the case was reassigned .
‚Äú I do n't have to file at the magisterial level , ‚Äù Sklarosky said , gesturing to the judge .
‚Äú Do n't point your finger at me , ‚Äù Malloy said .
The hearing then concluded . Officially , the hearing ended up as a continuance , with a new date set for Feb. 23 .
The charges against Cromer stem from allegations she made to investigators and from a restraining order application she filed against one of the troopers . In November , Cromer sought a protective order against state police Sgt . Daniel Jones , alleging that in November 2016 , Jones forced himself on her in a police car parked behind Mohegan Sun Pocono , where Cromer worked at the time as a cocktail waitress . Cromer subsequently dropped her effort to get a protective order .
The charges note that the first time Jones ever met Cromer was in May , when he interviewed her about allegations she raised that Covington had forced himself on her after she tried to break off a relationship with him .
Cromer 's story about Covington , which Cromer related to investigators during questioning , was nearly identical to the allegations she leveled against Jones . Citing Cromer 's ‚Äú multiple and inconsistent stories , ‚Äù police charged Cromer with making false reports and unsworn falsification .
She remains free on bail pending trial .

ISLAMABAD , Dec 11 ( APP ) : Close and friendly relations between Pakistan and France are getting stronger through a series of new initiatives and exchange of visits in the political , economic , cultural and educational fields , Ambassador of Pakistan to France Moin ul Haque said .
According to a message received here Monday , he was talking to a delegation of 107th National Management Course , who called on him at the Embassy of Pakistan to France in Paris . The 14-members NMC delegation is visiting France as part of their training course .
The Ambassador said that this month two parliamentary delegations from France are visiting Pakistan while a delegation of the Senate of Pakistan is expected to visit Paris in January 2018 . These contacts between our parliamentarians would contribute in a qualitative change in the bilateral relations , he added .
The Ambassador noted with satisfaction that there has been a steady increase in the volume of bilateral trade over the last few years which has reached US $ 1.4 billion in 2016 . France has remained a major investment partner of Pakistan with over forty
French companies working in Pakistan . The recent announcement by the Renault group to set up a car plant in Karachi in
partnership with Al Futtaim group is a welcome development .
Ambassador expressed the hope that NMC 's visit to Paris would provide them a good opportunity to learn about the French administrative structure , their training regimes and best practices and policies in other fields .
NMC delegation during their week-long stay in Paris would have meetings/briefings at the Ministry of Economy , Ministry of Climate Change , French Parliament , National School of Administration ( ENA ) , Centre of High Studies of Ministry of Interior
( CHEMI ) , UNESCO and Mairie of Sarcelles .
TOKYO : Japan 's ruling bloc enacted a law targeting conspiracies to commit terrorism and other serious crimes on Thursday , pushing it through parliament 's upper house despite concerns over civil liberties .
The vote followed opposition party delaying tactics , protests and concerns raised by a United Nations expert - who called the legislation `` defective '' - and came days before the current session of parliament was set to end on June 18 .
The result of the vote on the bill , which has divided the public , was shown live on public broadcaster NHK .
Japanese governments had tried three times previously to pass similar legislation , which officials say is needed to ratify a U.N. treaty aimed at global organised crime as well as to prevent terrorism as Tokyo prepares to host the 2020 Olympics .
The legislation would criminalise plotting and preparing to commit 277 `` serious crimes '' that critics such as the Japan Federation of Bar Associations note include acts with no obvious connection to terrorism or organised crime , such as sit-ins to protest construction of apartment buildings or copying music .

Opponents see the legislation as part of a broader agenda by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to increase state powers and fear ordinary citizens could be targeted , despite government assurances to the contrary .
Combined with a widening of legal wiretapping and the reluctance of courts to limit police surveillance powers , the changes could deter grassroots opposition to government policies , critics say .
To try to speed up passage of the law , the ruling bloc took the rare , contentious step of skipping a vote in an upper house committee and moving directly to a vote in the full upper house .
The U.N. special rapporteur on the right to privacy , Joseph Cannataci , wrote to Abe last month asking him to address the risk that the changes could `` lead to undue restrictions to the rights to privacy and to freedom of expression '' .
In an email to Reuters , Cannataci said the Japanese government had used `` the psychology of fear '' to push through `` defective legislation '' .
`` Japan needs to improve its safeguards for privacy , now even more so that this suspicious piece of legislation has been put on the statute books , '' he said in the email .
Critics say gathering information on possible plots would require expanded police surveillance , and the legislation has been compared to Japan 's `` thought police '' , who before and during World War Two had broad powers to investigate political groups seen as a threat to public order .
A Kyodo news agency survey last month showed voters are split over the bill , with support at 39.9 percent and opposition at 41.4 percent .

This year 's World Malaria Day coincides with activities to commemorate the 70th anniversary of World Health Organisation ( WHO ) . The Global Malaria Programme is marking the global malaria response , as it reflects on key moments in fighting this disease over the past seven decades .
Tracing the trajectory of malaria response since 1948 , when WHO was first created , from the early years of the Global Malaria Eradication Programme , WHO 's Dr Pedro Alonso reflects on unprecedented reductions in cases and deaths since the turn of the century and a corresponding slowdown in progress .
According to the global health body , during World War II , the casualties attributed to malaria led to the development of many of the tools that are available today , such as chloroquine , an anti-malaria drug , and DDT , an insecticide to kill the mosquito . With the creation of WHO in 1948 , and the optimism generated by these new tools , the Global Malaria Eradication Programme was launched in 1955 .
This effort represented the first-ever attempt in history to eradicate a disease from the planet . Ultimately , the objective was not achieved for a myriad of reasons and eradication efforts were paused in 1969 . What followed was a long period of reversals in many of the gains that had been achieved .
At the start of this century , the UN Millennium Development Goals ( MDGs ) pushed forward a renewed effort to fight malaria . The 10 and 15-year period following the adoption of the MDGs is considered a golden era in the fight against malaria . There are three key elements responsible for this ; First , new tools and strategies became available ; tools that were under development for many years , like insecticide-treated bed nets , rapid diagnostic tests and artemisinin combination therapies . Second , political leadership ; the Abuja Declaration of 2001 , the G7/G8 Summit of 2002 , and similar high-level events saw malaria and other communicable diseases rise to the top of global agenda .
The creation of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS , TB and Malaria was a critical aspect in this regard . Taken together , the significant injection of resources during this time frame enabled the global community to scale up malaria-fighting tools and achieve extraordinary impact : nearly seven million lives were saved and a reduction in global malaria mortality rates of more than 60 per cent .
For Nigeria , the economic loss attributable to malaria is estimated at N132 billion annually due mainly to loss of man hours resulting from sickness , absence and cost of treatment . It is a major cause of absenteeism from work and school ; it contributes to poverty and results in poor pregnancy outcome .
According to data from the Federal Ministry of Health , under National Health Management Information System ( NHMIS ) malaria is by far the most important cause of morbidity and mortality in infants ( 38 per cent and 28 per cent ) and young children ( 41 per cent and 30 per cent ) . It also contributes to an estimated 11 per cent of maternal mortality .
Malaria is a major public health problem in Nigeria where it accounts for more cases and deaths than any other country in the world . It is a risk for 97 per cent of Nigeria 's population while the remaining three per cent of the population live in the malaria free highlands .
The United States Agency for International Development ( USAID ) adds that there are an estimated 100 million malaria cases with over 300,000 deaths per year in Nigeria . This compares with 215,000 deaths per year in Nigeria from HIV/AIDS . On individual level , research results indicate that households would be prepared to pay an average of about N1 , 112 ( $ 9.3 ) per month for the treatment of malaria . This is about N427 ( $ 3.6 ) in excess of the average expenditure they currently make on malaria treatment per month . This amount represents about Naira 611.7 ( USD 5.1 ) per head per month and Naira 7,340 ( USD 61.2 ) per year . For a country with a population of about 180 million this translates to about 12.0 per cent of Gross Domestic Product .
It is pertinent to note , in our view that the closer a country moves towards malaria elimination , the more important it becomes to follow and track every single case , so that proper action can be taken . Unfortunately , we dare say , malaria surveillance systems are usually weakest in countries with the highest burden of disease , particularly in Africa . This is mostly due to a lack of good quality data relating to malaria morbidity and mortality trends .
To that extent , it is the opinion of this newspaper that there is an urgent need to develop new tools like diagnostics and new medicines , for which research is needed . To implement these tools , Nigeria , in particular , can do with operational or implementation research , which will help to know the best way to use them and ensure acceptability by communities .
New Delhi : The Congress on Monday demanded that Prime Minister Narendra Modi apologise to former prime minister Manmohan Singh and former vice-president Hamid Ansari and withdraw his statement alleging that `` they were colluding with Pakistan '' for defeating the BJP in Gujarat polls .
Congress senior spokesperson Anand Sharma also accused the prime minister of dragging the political discourse to an `` unacceptably low '' by making statements that harmed the dignity of his post .
He alleged that the Modi was `` frustrated '' as he had sensed a clear defeat of the BJP in Gujarat and was resorting to using foul language in his bid to whip up emotions and polarise Gujarat .
`` There can not be anything more as an explanation and there can not be anything more reprehensible than what he has done , '' he alleged .
`` The prime minister should restore the dignity of the political discourse , withdraw what he has said and apologise to the former prime minister and the former vice-president , '' Sharma told reporters .
Addressing an election rally , Modi on Sunday had claimed that Congress leaders held a secret meeting with current and former Pakistani officials a day ahead of Mani Shankar Aiyar 's `` neech '' jibe against him and that there was an attempt by Pakistan to interfere in the Gujarat polls .
Sharma dismissed as `` absurd '' the prime minister 's statement and said while Modi `` belongs to a party which has no contribution to the country 's freedom struggle while the Congress has fought it '' .
It is expected of the prime minister of India to be dignified in his discourse , he said , adding the prime minister should always remember that the Congress does not level allegations and cast aspersions on those who are on high positions .
`` He is seeking sympathy desperately by playing the victim card , which he and his party are playing while dragging the political discourse to an unacceptable low , '' he said .
His statement on Sunday by insinuation , accusing the former vice-president of India and former prime minister Manmohan Singh of doing something which was improper , `` is highly irresponsible , unwarranted and condemnable '' , Sharma said .
The Congress leader said the prime minister must remember that mere attending a social function in which high dignitaries were present should not be given a `` sinister and sensational twist '' , especially when it was not a secret meeting .
He said the former chief of Indian Army , former Indian High Commissioners to Pakistan and eminent journalists were all present at this dinner meeting hosted by Aiyar .
`` Since when has it become a crime and one needs to seek permission before attending a dinner , '' he asked .
The Congress leader also asked why the prime minister does not talk about progress and the country 's economy .
`` Why does n't he talk about farmers today ? Why does n't he talk about employment , the future of youth ? What is their agenda , on what basis are they fighting the polls ? '' he asked .
SEOUL/BEIJING : Reining in North Korea 's nuclear ambitions will top South Korean President Moon Jae-in 's agenda in Beijing during a visit this week aimed at breaking the ice after a furious row with China over Seoul 's deployment of a U.S. anti-missile system .
While both Seoul and Beijing share the goal of getting Pyongyang to give up its nuclear weapons and stop testing increasingly sophisticated long-range missiles , the two neighbours have not seen eye-to-eye on how to achieve this .
China has been particularly angered at the deployment of U.S.-made Terminal High Altitude Area Defence ( THAAD ) anti-missile system in South Korea , saying its powerful radar can see far into China and will do nothing to ease tensions with North Korea .
At his third meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping this year on Thursday in Beijing , Moon is expected to reaffirm South Korea 's agreement with China in late October the two would normalise all exchanges and move past the year-long spat over THAAD , which froze trade and business exchanges between the two .
The THAAD dispute had dented South Korea 's economic growth , especially its tourism industry , as group tours from China came to a halt while charter flights from South Korea were cancelled .
While China still objects to THAAD , it has said it understands South Korea 's decision to deploy it .

In an interview with Chinese state television shown late on Monday , Moon said THAAD 's presence is inevitable due to the looming North Korean threat but assured it would not be used against China .
`` South Korea will be extremely careful from here on out that the THAAD system is not invasive of China 's security . South Korea has received promises from the United States multiple times regarding this , '' Moon said .
Joint efforts by China and South Korea could have `` good results '' if they work together to bring North Korea to the negotiation table , he added .
Speaking over the weekend , Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said Moon had chosen to have `` friendly cooperation '' with China , and that China was willing to work with South Korea to bring peace and stability to the Korean peninsula .
In its latest missile provocation , Pyongyang test-launched what it called its most advanced intercontinental ballistic missile ( ICBM ) ever in defiance of international sanctions and condemnation as it continues its mission to create a nuclear-tipped ICBM that can hit the United States .
During his first visit to China since taking office in May this year , Moon is expected to get bilateral economic exchanges back on track . According to South Korean media , Moon will be accompanied by the biggest business entourage ever with more than 220 businesses partaking in the four-day visit .
Before returning to Seoul , Moon will head to Chongqing to meet with its Communist Party boss Chen Miner , a close ally of Xi 's .

KUALA LUMPUR : Malaysia 's Attorney-General Tommy Thomas said more charges relating to the 1MDB scandal will be filed , once he receives new investigation papers ( IPs ) from the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission ( MACC ) .
‚Äú Today 's case is the first IP that came to my table when I clocked in three weeks ago , '' he told reporters on Wednesday ( Jul 4 ) at the Kuala Lumpur Courts Complex . `` No doubt , there will be more IPs . ''

Thomas was speaking after he led the prosecution team in the case against former prime minister Najib Razak , who was charged with three counts of criminal breach of trust and one count of abuse of power in connection with a transaction involving SRC International , a former unit of 1MDB .
Najib , 64 , pleaded not guilty to the charges .
Thomas also commented on the interim gag order requested by Najib 's lawyers , saying that the prosecution team was taken by surprise .
‚Äú We are also not sure about the extent of the gag order . We were taken by surprise and no ground was given . We are totally against it as we believe in free speech , ‚Äù he said .

The attorney-general added that the judge overseeing the case also did not provide any grounds in approving the order .
Meanwhile , Najib 's lawyer Muhammad Shafee Abdullah has questioned the prosecution 's readiness in pursuing their case against his client .
He said he believed that Thomas ' team was still looking for evidence in the case .
‚Äú We requested February and March to have the hearing . We want it earlier if possible , but the weird thing is , the one prosecuting us is not prepared , '' Muhammad Shafee told reporters after the court proceeding .
`` Perhaps , ( they 're ) still looking for evidence . ''
The trial is set to take place in February and March next year , from Feb 18 to 28 , Mar 4 to 8 and Mar 11 to 15 .
Najib , who was allowed bail of RM1 million in two sureties in cash , was also ordered to surrender his passports .
Commenting on the gag order , Muhammad Shafee said it was to stop anyone from making statements to the media and interfering with the court proceedings .
`` We asked for a gag order against people who have nothing to do with the case from making statements to the media ‚Ä¶ even Najib can not make any comments in the media . ‚Äù

Wang Jian , a co-founder of the company , suffered `` severe injuries '' in a fall in Provence in southern France and died Tuesday at age 57 , said an HNA Group statement . It gave no other details .
Wang fell into a 10-meter ( 32-foot ) void while taking photos on a high wall in Bonnieux , a town in a region famed for its panoramic views .
`` Together , we mourn the loss of an exceptionally gifted leader and role model , whose vision and values will continue to be a beacon for all who had the good fortune to know him , '' his firm said in a statement issued in China .
HNA said Wang , whose personal fortune is estimated at $ 1.7 billion by Forbes magazine , had been visiting Bonnieux during a business trip to France .
The company started as a small provincial airline servicing China 's Hainan Province but has expanded quickly in recent years under the leadership of Wang and business partner Chen Feng .
The firm 's $ 230 billion in assets were built up during a foreign buying spree that saw it diversify into tourism and finance via major deals to buy shares in companies including the Hilton hotels group and Deutsche Bank .
It also took stakes in foreign airlines such as Virgin Australia , France 's Aigle Azur and TAP in Portugal .
But HNA came under pressure last year as Beijing cracked down on the risky debt-fueled financing that enabled its expansion .
The conglomerate has started selling parts of its empire to pay down its loans , including its Hilton and Deutsche Bank shares , and Wang 's death was seen as likely to complicate the unwinding process .
`` Wang 's passing will mark the end of an era of aggressive expansion by HNA , '' Corrine Png , chief executive at the Singapore-based research firm Crucial Perspective , told the Bloomberg financial news agency .
`` It will also put HNA Group and related companies ' restructuring plans back on the drawing board , in our view , '' Png added .
Warut Promboon , managing partner at credit research firm Bondcritic , told the news agency that Wang 's death would be a blow because the company `` relies on personal connections , especially with Chinese banks and Chinese government officials . ''
At the end of 2017 , the company reported that its debt was 638 billion yuan ( 81.5 billion euros ) , up 36 percent from 2016 .
Wang owned about 15 percent of the Chinese group , making him one of the group 's biggest shareholders , Bloomberg reported .
Wang began his career in civil aviation planning in 1983 .
Bonnieux is a medieval village in the Provence area of the south of France , a favored destination for the rich and famous over the peak summer holiday period .

According to weather experts , Southern California is about to be enveloped in the sweaty embrace of the season 's first heat wave , which means roughly seven days of cursing God for your apartment 's lack of central air conditioning . Nighttime and mornings are bearable , but daytime and especially the afternoon hours can be brutal with nothing but an aging window unit and a few fans to keep you cool . Luckily , there are loads of places in L.A. where you can go to cool off . The movies ( we recommend a cheap , second-run theater , such as Regency Academy 6 in Pasadena with $ 3 tickets ) , the library and the beach are staples , of course , but here are 10 additional ideas that wo n't break the bank .
1 . That museum you 've been meaning to visit
Los Angeles is chock-full of museums with wonderful programming and sweet , sweet central air conditioning . Some , like the Hammer ( 10899 Wilshire Blvd. , Westwood ) and the Getty ( 1200 Getty Center Drive , Brentwood ) , are always free ( although the Getty charges $ 15 for parking ) , while others , like the Broad ( 221 S. Grand Ave. , downtown ) and the brand-new Marciano Art Foundation ( 4357 Wilshire Blvd. , Windsor Square ) are free when tickets or reservations are made in advance . But , OK , you ca n't exactly plan for a heat wave , so keep an eye on museums with weekly free days : LACMA ( 5905 Wilshire Blvd. , Mid-Wilshire ) is free the second Tuesday of every month , Autry Museum of the American West ( 4700 Western Heritage Way , Griffith Park ) is free on the first Tuesday of the month and the Museum of Latin American Art ( 628 Alamitos Ave. , Long Beach ) is free every Sunday . There 's a lot more to explore .

2 . The skating rink
The skating rink ‚Äî be it roller or ice ‚Äî has always been a perfect place to spend a few hours cooling off and getting some exercise in the summertime . L.A. has a handful of good options . Besides its popular adults-only party nights ‚Äî like the forthcoming George Michael Memorial Skate on June 25 ‚Äî Moonlight Rollerway ( 5110 San Fernando Road , Glendale ) has a summertime skate session from 1:30 to 4 p.m. Sundays through Thursdays , plus an afternoon skate from 3:30 to 5 p.m. on Friday and a morning skate for kids on Saturday . And although it might sound counterintuitive to cool off in the Valley , Pickwick Ice in Burbank ( 1001 W. Riverside Drive ) has daily public skate sessions beginning at either 1 , 2 or 3 p.m. , and Iceland Ice Skating Center in Van Nuys ( 14318 Calvert St. ) has both daytime and evening public sessions many days of the week .

3 . Stores with shit to do
Sure , you could spend an hour or two wandering around Whole Foods eating samples and sniffing natural soaps , or go to the Smart & Final on Beverly in Historic Filipinotown and hang out in the refrigerated cheese room , but there are lots of stores to loiter in browse that have way more fun stuff to do . Even if you 're an adult , toy stores will keep you busy for a while , and we happen to have a whole list of suggestions that run the geographical gamut from Little Tokyo to Montrose . Musical instrument stores are fun , too , even chains like Guitar Center and Sam Ash , where futzing around with a bass guitar is n't frowned upon . And then there 's ...

4 . IKEA
The ultimate `` store with shit to do , '' Ikea requires an entry all its own . The Scandinavian furniture and home goods store ‚Äî with locations in Burbank , Carson , Covina and Costa Mesa , locally ‚Äî is a monument to commerce so massive , we 're relatively sure you could spend a day or several `` testing '' various ready-to-assemble sofas and beds and soaking up AC and no one would be the wiser . You can even have lunch in the cafeteria . Hell , you can have `` the Valley 's hottest brunch '' with friends , take a lunch meeting and then invite a date to your favorite new hangout for a dinner of Swedish meatballs and lingonberry jam .
5 . Mount Wilson Observatory
To catch some cooler air , we have a tendency to head west toward the ocean , but there 's also the option to travel upward into the San Gabriel Mountains . Located at an altitude of 5,700 feet above sea level , Mount Wilson Observatory , northeast of Altadena , invites visitors inside a dome to check out the Hooker 100-inch telescope , the very instrument that was used by Edwin Hubble to prove that the universe extends beyond the Milky Way and by Fritz Zwicky to find evidence of dark matter . There 's a small museum as well as a little eatery called the Cosmic Cafe , and keep an eye out for classical music concerts under the dome on Sunday afternoons .
By John Sorce | SHREWSBURY ‚Äì A Greens and Grains restaurant is coming to Shrewsbury Plaza in 2018 . The project was proposed before the Shrewsbury Zoning Board at the Reorganization Meeting on Jan. 3 and was approved . Greens and Grains is a part of LAN Restaurant Group , with headquarters in Linwood . The restaurant currently has three other locations ‚Äì all located in Atlantic County ‚Äì in Galloway , Northfield and Margate City . LAN Restaurant owners Nicole Jacoby and her husband Lambros Psounos are partnering with Danielle and Joseph Bucci of Eleven11 Hospitality , LLC to grow the Greens and Grains brand .
The first Greens and Grains to come to central New Jersey will be located in a 2,125-square-foot store in Shrewsbury Plaza , the shopping center on Broad Street anchored by AC Moore , Marshalls and Home Goods and soon , OrangeTheory Fitness . Panera Bread and Jersey Mikes eateries are also located in the plaza . The couple has been involved in the restaurant and hospitality business for their entire careers , and saw a fit for healthier options in Monmouth County . ‚Äú In New York and most big cities , you can find healthy options everywhere , but in the suburbs , it 's not so easy , ‚Äù Danielle Bucci said in an email .
The concept will be ‚Äú grab and go ‚Äù with in-house seating for about 35 customers , according to the proposal . They anticipate 65 to 70 percent of the business will be takeout . The anticipated cost of development is in the $ 245- $ 300,000 range , and they plan to construct a full- service kitchen of about 600 square feet . Lightbridge Academy Center Coming to Shrewsbury The business expects to create a total of 9 to 10 positions , with three full-time employees and six or seven part-timers , excluding the storeowner . They plan to serve breakfast , lunch and dinner options , and the operating hours will be approximately 7 a.m. to 8:30 p.m .
A deputy of the far-right Alternative for Germany ( AfD ) slammed Friday his colleagues from the German Left Party ( Die Linke ) over their intention to question Turkey 's decision to launch an operation in Syria against the PKK terror group , its affiliates Democratic Unity Party ( PYD ) and its armed wing People 's Protection Units ( YPG ) .
Petr Bystron , who was holding his first speech at the German parliament , said that the Left Party was pretending to be `` a party of peace , '' but was actually quite the opposite .
The Left Party previously criticized Turkey for using German tanks in the ongoing Operation Olive Branch in northwestern Syria 's Afrin region .
`` Who is Erdoƒüan 's army fighting in Syria ? The Kurdish YPG , an offshoot of the banned Marxist PKK , which is considered a terrorist organization in Germany , but also in the U.S . ''
Referring to Left Party members , Bystron said that they were `` not concerned with stopping the armed conflict . ''
`` Your concern is that the Turkish attack is targeting your Marxist comrades from the PKK , '' he said .
The far-right AfD deputy also criticized the Left Party for wearing YPG scarfs in the parliament as a show of support for the terrorist organization .
The PKK is listed as a terror organization not just by Turkey , but also by the European Union and the United States . However , it has long enjoyed relative freedom in European cities and has a particularly strong presence in Germany with PKK supporters being allowed to hold rallies , recruit militants and collect funds .
Operation Olive Branch was launched by Turkey on Jan. 20 to remove the PKK/PYD/YPG/KCK and Daesh terrorists from Afrin in northwestern Syria .
According to the Turkish General Staff , the operation aims to establish security and stability along Turkish borders and in the region as well as to protect Syrian people from the oppression and cruelty of terrorists .
The operation is being carried out under the framework of Turkey 's rights within international law , U.N. Security Council resolutions , its right to self-defense under the U.N. charter and respect for Syria 's territorial integrity .
Golfer Louis Oosthuizen closed the weekend 's PGA Championship in a three-way tie for second place alongside Francesco Molinari and Patrick Reed , a result not unfamiliar to the South African native .
By finishing two strokes behind winner Justin Thomas , Oosthuizen earned the distinction of being runner-up at a fourth different major . However , the 2010 British Open champion was in good spirits after the tournament and decided to commemorate the result by lip-syncing Andra Day 's `` Rise Up '' while aboard his private jet .

It did n't take long for several of Oosthuizen 's peers to chime in on his performance .
Too good ! ‚Äî Kevin Kisner ( @ K_Kisner ) August 14 , 2017
No topping that tonight , that was world class ‚Äî Kevin Kisner ( @ K_Kisner ) August 14 , 2017

Can you imagine @ jacknicklaus doing this ? ‚Äî Phil Casey ( @ pcaseysafc ) August 14 , 2017
Oosthuizen finished second to Bubba Watson at the 2012 Masters , tied for second behind Jordan Speith at the 2015 U.S. Open and was runner-up alongside Marc Leishman following a three-way playoff that Zach Johnson won at the 2015 British Open .
Although winning the PGA Championship would have been sweeter for Oosthuizen , the $ 784,000 payout for the No . 2 player at Quail Hollow certainly helped his bankroll `` Rise Up '' as well .

Emmanuel Macron plans to award multi-year grants for several U.S.-based scientists to relocate to France , his office said on Monday on the eve of a climate summit hosted by the president to raise finances to counter global warming .
PARIS : Emmanuel Macron plans to award multi-year grants for several U.S.-based scientists to relocate to France , his office said on Monday on the eve of a climate summit hosted by the president to raise finances to counter global warming .
Macron unveiled the `` Make our Planet Great Again '' grants after President Donald Trump in June said he was pulling the United States out of an international accord to reduce greenhouse gas emissions that was brokered in Paris in 2015 .
Macron repeatedly tried to persuade the U.S. leader to reverse his decision . In a statement , the Elysee Palace said 13 of the initial 18 grants would be awarded to scientists based in the United States . Macron will make a detailed announcement later on Monday evening .
At Tuesday 's summit , Macron will urge wealthy nations to increase climate financing and urge investors to turn their backs on polluters in a bid to accelerate efforts to combat global warming .
French state-controlled utility EDF on Monday said it would invest 25 billion euros to develop 30 gigawatts of solar capacity in France between 2020 an 2035 . Daily Newspaper Les Echos quoted the chief executive of Engie , Isabelle Kocher , as saying her company would invest one billion euros to improve the energy efficiency of buildings .
Separately , nine European energy companies including EDF , Italy 's Enel , Spain 's Iberdrola and Britain 's SSE said they would include green bonds in their financing policies .

Developing nations say that the rich are not on track with a broader commitment in the Paris accord for wealthy economies to provide US $ 100 billion ( ¬£74.9 billion ) a year by 2020 - from public and private sources alike - to help developing countries switch from fossil fuels to greener energy sources and adapt to the effects of climate change .
Oxfam estimated that there was only between US $ 4 - US $ 8 billion available for adaptation and that recent estimates showed the cost of helping to emerge nations deal with rising sea levels , droughts , flooding and other effects of global warming could add up to US $ 140 to 300 billion per year by 2030 .
`` Right now , the world 's poorest people are getting only a tiny fraction of the help they desperately need to survive , '' Oxfam said in a statement .
`` This year 's barrage of climate disasters showed that poor communities are often completely unprepared to deal with extreme weather . ''

ESPN 's Samantha Ponder and her NFL quarterback husband , Christian Ponder , are expecting their third child , Page Six has learned .
Samantha ‚Äî the host of the sports network 's ‚Äú Sunday NFL Countdown , ‚Äù who took over from Chris Berman ‚Äî told us that she backed out of an assignment to go ice fishing on Friday morning when the temperature dangerously dipped to 7 below zero in Minneapolis .
‚Äú I was supposed to go ice fishing this morning and I backed out , ‚Äù she revealed at a panel talk at h.wood Group 's Bootsy Bellows pop-up .
She further told us afterward , with a laugh , ‚Äú I was like , ‚Äò I do n't think it 's a good idea for the pregnant woman to go . ' ‚Äù
Former Jets coach Rex Ryan ¬≠instead got the icy assignment . ( Meanwhile , ESPN 's Mike Greenberg chimed in during the panel talk , ‚Äú I would n't go ice fishing if it was 80 degrees . ‚Äù )
Samantha posted on Instagram before heading to the big game , ‚Äú Third kid life is rough man . Finished my 3rd pregnant football season in the last 4 years . . . Not gon na lie , avoiding puking on national TV is probably my biggest accomplishment to date . ‚Äù
She said of her two kids at home , ‚Äú Scout and True got to be at National Championships before they were born , but this baby will have them beat at the Super Bowl . # Ponderpartyof5 . ‚Äù
Samantha and Christian revealed they had welcomed their second child , son Robinson True ( inspired by Jackie Robinson as well as former NBA great David Robinson ) in June .
During the pregnancy , Samantha got high marks for fighting back against Twitter trolls who were inappropriately commenting on her appearance on TV . She wrote last year : ‚Äú Getting sexist/vulgar tweets abt my job/appearance while I 'm unable to see my own feet & covered in toddler pee is somethin else I tell ya . ‚Äù
On Thursday , she also posted in an Instagram post plugging a pretzel brand : ‚Äú Headed to Minneapolis for # SB52 ! ! Whether I 'm trying to avoid unhealthy airport food , traveling with kids or just pregnant and in need of a constant snack . ‚Äù
Also participating in the ‚Äú Inside the Game : Insider Hall of Fame ‚Äù panel , hosted by Minneapolis sports agency IFA , were NFL stars Jerome Bettis and Adam Thielen .

There is nothing in this world quite so determined as a toddler . Determined , stubborn , whatever you want to call it . The point is , toddlers have n't had to come to terms with the soul-crushing disappointments and expectations of adulthood , and are therefore still able to believe that whatever they want to do is most likely the right thing . Even if someone else , say a wise parent who might know a thing or two more than them , tells them they 're wrong . Case in point ; the toddler eating an onion in this viral video that has the internet in stitches .
Not that this little tyke would tell you it was an onion . No , according to the caption on the video shared by Gesa Croonan on Facebook on Wednesday , the toddler insisted it was an apple . And kept on insisting until getting into a little hot water . The caption reads :
Mom , can I have this apple ?
That 's not an apple , it 's an onion .
No , it 's an apple !
It 's an onion .
It 's an apple !
Well , if you insist ... ( would rather die than admitting an error ) .
I 'm assuming this mom figured she would let the onion eating happen as a little life lesson . Sometimes it 's ok to admit you 're wrong , sometimes you need to listen to your parents because they know way more than you . Sometimes an apple is an onion ... whatever .
Unfortunately , this toddler was n't giving in .
This kid , right ? Not only eating the onion ( and trying not to look disgusted ) but going back for bite after bite . Looking into the camera with fierce determination , pretty much daring any one of the more than 28 million people who have watched this video since Wednesday to call that `` apple '' an onion . Like , go ahead . Say it . Call it an onion ... I dare you . Side note : you really , truly need to have the audio on for this video . To hear this toddler breathing heavily through the ordeal is maybe the best part . Or the eye rubbing . I 'm not sure .
The video , which was also shared on Reddit , has racked up some pretty hilarious comments from the internet . Many social media users begrudgingly praised the toddler for sticking with it .
It 's possible it is a Vidalia onion or some other sweet onion that is n't so bad . Or it 's possible that kid is just willing to die on that hill .
That kid is goddamn trooper .
This kiddo has layers of commitment . I commend their fruitless efforts .
One has to wonder what this little one will be like as a grown-up ... I 'm not going to lie , George Costanza from Seinfeld comes to mind .
There were plenty of people on Twitter making the solid case that this kid eating an onion while insisting it was an apple could be the perfect metaphor for more than one situation .
We all know someone like this toddler , and if you do n't recognize one of your friends ( or probably one of your own kids ) in this toddler insisting an onion is an apple , you might actually be that person yourself . Determined , willful , stubborn . These are not terrible qualities to have , of course . Unless you 're going to get stuck munching your way through an onion rather than admitting you might have made a mistake . On account of you 're just a small child .
I see two things happening down the road ; either this kid is going to be a brilliant ruler of a country some day , or a terrifying despot . It could go either way .
Or there 's another possible option . The kid could just grow out of being stubborn . For some reason , I hope that does n't happen . Stick with it , kid . One of these days , that apple is going to be an actual apple . You 'll be right , and we 'll all rue the day we dared to contradict you .
DAKAR : Top opposition leaders in Democratic Republic of Congo called on the new prime minister on Monday to investigate revelations by Reuters last week that most of the money paid by Congolese citizens for new passports goes overseas .
Documents reviewed by Reuters of a 2015 deal between Congo 's government and a Belgian company called Semlex to produce biometric passports show that most of the US $ 185 price for a new passport goes to Semlex and a small company called LRPS in the United Arab Emirates .
According to a person with direct knowledge of the passport deal , the UAE-registered company - which receives US $ 60 for every passport issued - is owned by Makie Makolo Wangoi , believed to be a close relative of Congo President Joseph Kabila .
The Congolese presidency , Wangoi and Semlex did not respond to requests for comment for last week 's story .
Speaking to reporters in the capital , Kinshasa , Felix Tshisekedi said the main opposition bloc that he leads would only speak to incoming Prime Minister Bruno Tshibala once he takes action over the passport affair .
`` He should start by resolving the problem of the scandal taking place in the republic today - the scandal of the passports , '' Tshisekedi said . `` Tshibala should show his independence by resolving this problem , and then we will speak . ''
Claudel Andre Lubaya , an opposition member of parliament and former provincial governor , also called on the attorney general to investigate the matter .
The youth activist group Lucha reacted to the story on its Twitter feed by saying that Congo `` is hostage to a band of stealers and criminals . ''
A government spokesman could not be immediately reached for comment on Monday .
Corruption is endemic in the vast central African state . Kabila 's counsellor on graft and money laundering said in 2015 that the country loses up to US $ 15 billion a year to fraud , roughly three times the annual budget .
Kabila also faces calls from the opposition to step down this year after he refused to quit power at the end of his constitutional mandate in December , citing delays organizing an election to replace him .

A controversy of the past continues to haunt government officers in Cebu .
The Commission on Audit ( COA ) has ordered officials of the Department of Public Works and Highways in Central Visayas ( DPWH-7 ) to return the P43.95 million they paid to the contractor of the allegedly overpriced lampposts installed in the cities of Cebu and Mandaue for the Association of Southeast Asian Nations ( Asean ) Summit in 2007 .
In a two-page decision , state auditors affirmed the disallowance of the partial payment already made to Gampik Construction and Development Inc. , saying that the street-lighting project was illegal since it did not go through public bidding .

COA also directed its Prosecution and Litigation Office to refer the case to the Office of the Ombudsman for possible charges against the persons responsible for the controversial procurement of lampposts for the two cities .
The DPWH-7 skipped public bidding and entered into contracts on September 2006 in preparation for the Asean Summit in January 2007 . The total cost of the contracts was P54.94 million ‚Äî about three times higher than COA 's evaluated cost of P19.38 million . The P43.95 million represented the advance payment received by Gampik .
At least 660 of the total 1,800 decorative lampposts were installed in the cities of Cebu and Mandaue .
‚Äú At the outset , this commission holds that there was a clear violation as the project did not undergo the required public bidding . It is worthy to note that the lack of public bidding may be considered by this commission as the ground for the disallowance of the entire amount stated in the contracts , ‚Äù said the decision signed by COA chairperson Michael Aguinaldo , and commissioners Jose Fabia and Isabel Agito .
The decision was dated Dec. 29 , 2016 , a copy of which was obtained by the Philippine Daily Inquirer yesterday .
Anomalous
Although officials cited the lack of time in foregoing public bidding , the COA said it still did not justify the resort to negotiated procurement . The mode , it said , is allowed only in times of emergencies where there is imminent danger .
‚Äú The hosting of the Asean Summit is not a disaster . Since there is no calamity at the time the projects were implemented , there is no danger to speak of , ‚Äù the COA commissioners said .
They also cited the failure of DPWH-7 officials to post the notice of negotiated contracts at the Government Electronic Procurement System ( G-EPS ) website ‚Äî a requirement under Republic Act 9184 or the Government Procurement Reform Act .
An audit report described as ‚Äú bloated and excessive ‚Äù the contract cost agreed upon by DPWH-7 and Gampik Construction and Development Inc. as compared to the evaluated cost made by COA , resulting to an ‚Äú overpayment ‚Äù of P24.569 million .
'Not my case '
DPWH-7 Director Ador Canlas begged off from issuing any statement to the media , saying he is not privy to the details of the case and that the DPWH officials involved in the case are no longer with the department .
‚Äú Well , I am not part of that case . I was n't the regional director at that time when the procurement was made . Hence , I 'd rather not comment on that , ‚Äù he told Cebu Daily News .
He said he also has no idea on how the payment will be done .
‚Äú I do n't know yet whether it will be DPWH-7 or the individual respondents who pay the contractor . Basta whatever the decision says , that should be respected , ‚Äù Canlas said .
Lawyer Ma . Corazon Naraja , spokesperson of the Office of the Ombudsman in the Visayas , also refused to interpret COA 's ruling as to who should pay the government .
‚Äú COA has the competence and expertise to answer that . It 's their decision to disallow the disbursement , ‚Äù she said in a text message to Cebu Daily News .
Cebu Daily News tried but failed to get a statement from lawyer Joey Luis Wee , the counsel of the DPWH-7 officials who were linked to the controversy .
Wee first responded in a text message to Cebu Daily News , asking what issue he would comment on .
When informed about the COA ruling , he did not respond . Cebu Daily News contacted him but he did n't answer the calls .
Trial continues
At present , graft cases are pending before the Sandiganbayan against nine DPWH officials , two private contractors , and local government officials for the purchase of 1,800 China-made lampposts believed to be overpriced .
Both former mayors Thadeo Ouano of Mandaue City and Arturo Radaza of Lapu-Lapu City were impleaded in the lamppost scandal by the Ombudsman .
The Sandiganbayan dropped the lone case against Radaza in 2013 .
Ouano was named in two cases . One case against him was dismissed in 2011 , while the remaining case was junked after the former Mandaue City mayor passed away in February last year .
All respondents in the lamppost cases were earlier found guilty of grave misconduct by the Ombudsman-Visayas and were ordered dismissed from public service .
Ouano and Radaza , however , escaped the penalty because they were reelected .
Under the Aguinaldo Doctrine , reelection to office condones administrative liability for misconduct done during a previous term . However , criminal liability can not be erased .
It was only in 2015 when the controversial doctrine was junked by the Supreme Court .
Aside from the two local officials , also impleaded in the charges were former DPWH-7 regional director Robert Lala and officers Gloria Dindin , Marlina Alvizo , Pureza Fernandez , Cresencio Bagolor , Augustinito Hermoso , Luis Galang , and Restitutu Diano , and Buenaventura Pajo .
In March 2007 , the Ombudsman investigated the acquisition of decorative lampposts installed along the streets of the cities of Cebu , Mandaue , and Lapu-Lapu .
Overpriced
The Ombudsman-Visayas said a comparison of the costs of the 1,800 lampposts as indicated in the Programs of Work and Estimates ( POWE ) prepared by Mandaue City and reflected in the importation documents showed the equipment were overpriced by nearly 10 times their actual cost .
The Lapu-Lapu City POWE covering the costs of the lampposts was practically the same with Mandaue City .
The POWE prepared by the DPWH covered the procurement and installation of the lampposts in Cebu City and some parts of Lapu-Lapu City .
The DPWH then under secretary Hermogenes Ebdane spearheaded the acquisition of the China-made lampposts .
The funds used and/or allocated for the purchase were reportedly taken from the Motor Vehicle Users Charge Fund .
The local chief executives of the cities of Cebu , Mandaue , and Lapu-Lapu were given a chance to choose the design of the lampposts to be installed in their respective areas .
The anti-graft office said officials of Mandaue and Lapu-Lapu prepared the corresponding POWE for the lampposts .
For the lampposts installed in Cebu City , the POWE was prepared by the DPWH-7 officials since Cebu City Mayor Tomas Osme√±a refused to sign any POWE .
The two contractors for the project were Fabmik Construction and Equipment Co. Inc. , and Gampik Construction and Development Inc .
COA issued a ruling on the appeal of Gampik Construction and Development Inc. to allow the full payment from DPWH for the installation of streets lamps in the cities of Cebu and Mandaue .
A plan to ‚Äú triage ‚Äù asylum seekers crossing the Canada-U.S. border illegally , in an effort to move some migrants out of Quebec and into Ontario , has stalled because Ontario is in the midst of a provincial election .
Federal Transport Minister Marc Garneau says Ontario civil servants have been working on details of the plan with the federal government and Quebec , but nothing can be finalized until a new provincial government is in place .
WATCH : Canada rejects immigrants based on incomplete data
‚Äú There 's a lot of very hard work being done by civil servants who work for Immigration Ontario to look at the whole issue of the triage , which is more than just a reception centre . It 's the whole process of absorbing people who want to go to Ontario . And that entails resources ‚Äì financial resources , and other kinds of resources , manpower resources , ‚Äù Garneau told reporters Wednesday .
‚Äú There is an election going on and , when it 's all in place , there will be a requirement to get the new government of Ontario , whatever that government is , to sign onto that . ‚Äù
The ad hoc intergovernmental task force on irregular migration met Wednesday evening to discuss the ongoing issue of illegal border crossers and how to address pressures facing Quebec , where the vast majority of irregular migrants are arriving .

The group of federal and provincial officials also met last month , when they reached agreements on measures including the creation of a so-called triage system to identify asylum seekers interested in going to areas outside Montreal or Toronto to await the outcome of their refugee claims .
So far , the system has not materialized .
Quebec Immigration Minister David Heurtel says his province 's resources are becoming strained . More than 9,000 refugee claimants have crossed into Canada through unofficial paths along the border so far this year , with 90 per cent of them landing in Quebec .

A majority of the primarily Nigerian asylum seekers who have arrived this year have indicated they want to live in Ontario . That 's why Heurtel says he wants to see the triage system up and running , to help facilitate travel and other arrangements for those who want to go to Ontario .
‚Äú For us it is important to see that people who do not want to be in Quebec do not have to stay in Quebec , ‚Äù he said in French .
Heurtel noted that all federal resources and claims processing centres for these migrants are in Montreal , which is why many of them are remaining there despite wanting to leave .
WATCH : $ 112 M added to budget to deal with ‚Äò irregular immigration '
Garneau said all they can do is continue to work on the details , which he says are complex .
‚Äú Very significant progress has been made on what is a fairly complex operation , ‚Äù he said .
‚Äú It includes accommodations and other service that are provided . And of course , like Quebec , which is getting near full capacity , Toronto is getting near full capacity . So there 's also a conscious effort to see whether , while people are going to Ontario , whether they would go to smaller centres in Ontario . ‚Äù
Concerns have also been raised by both Quebec and Ontario about costs they say the provinces have borne as a result of the surge of irregular migrants .
They 're looking to Ottawa for reimbursement , with Quebec seeking $ 146 million and the city of Toronto recently stating it needs $ 64 million to recover its costs .

Garneau said Wednesday those financial negotiations are ongoing .
Meanwhile , federal Immigration Minister Ahmed Hussen said the month of May has seen a drop in the number of irregular migrants , which he attributes to getting the message out that crossing the border illegally is no free ticket to Canada .
In April , an average of 83 asylum seekers were crossing per day . So far in May the average has been 51 per day .
But Heurtel says the federal government must also do more to reduce the amount of time it takes to process the refugee claims .
Many of these border-crossers are well aware there are significant delays , and this is an incentive for them to come to Canada illegally , he said .
‚Äú For us this is the heart of the problem . ‚Äù
Olympics - Ireland 's Rio ticket agent was front for banned seller , says report
by Reuters 15 Aug 2017 , 00:54 IST

DUBLIN ( Reuters ) - The agent at the centre of an alleged scheme to illegally pass Ireland 's tickets for the 2016 Rio Olympics to touts was `` not genuine '' and was used to hide the involvement of banned ticket reseller THG , a Irish government report said on Monday .
The Olympic movement was rocked during the Rio Games when Europe 's top official , head of the Olympic Council of Ireland ( OCI ) Patrick Hickey , was arrested in a dawn raid on a luxury beachfront hotel by police investigating the alleged scheme .
Police in Brazil accuse Hickey of operating the ring with Dublin-based PRO10 Sports Management to funnel tickets intended for use by the Irish Olympic committee , and not authorised for resale , to international sports hospitality company THG Sports .
Hickey was released on bail in December . All involved deny wrongdoing .
A report commissioned by the Irish government in the wake of the scandal said on Monday it believed that PRO10 was effectively a front for THG , which had been banned by the organisers of the Rio Games .
`` It appears that Pro10 was not a genuine Authorised Ticket Reseller ( ATR ) but its involvement disguised the continuing role of THG and Marcus Evans as the real or de facto ATR , '' Judge Carroll Moran said in the report .
Evans is a British businessman whose namesake company controls THG .
The report cites Hickey 's personal assistant Linda O'Reilly , as saying it `` would appear that PRO10 was effectively a front or cover to allow Marcus Evans and THG to remain in the picture . ''
THG said in a statement it was satisfied that , at all times , it had `` acted lawfully in connection with the Rio Olympics , or any Olympics , '' but declined further comment .
Hickey , 72 , said in a statement he had received legal advice not to cooperate with the report in order to avoid prejudicing himself in relation to the criminal investigation in Brazil , but said the report contained `` significant inaccuracies . ''
He added that he was `` totally confident '' he would be cleared of all charges .
Hickey 's replacement as OCI president , Sarah Keane , told journalists the report `` did not make easy reading '' but that it neither confirmed nor refuted the possibility that criminal activity took place .
THG REJECTED
THG had been Ireland 's official reseller of tickets for the Olympics in London in 2012 and at Sochi in 2014 .
But the Rio Organising Committee rejected the application of THG to act as reseller for the 2016 Summer Games , saying the fact it was already offering hospitality packages in Brazil breached its rules .
Police last year said they had uncovered emails between Hickey and Evans in which the pair discussed tickets , which police said the ring planned to sell at inflated prices and earn as much as 10 million reais ( $ 3.14 million ) in profit .
Reuters could not independently verify the authenticity of the emails .
Monday 's report noted that THG paid $ 1 million to be appointed as Ireland 's ticket reseller for the Olympic Games in London in 2012 and at Sochi in 2014 `` without an explanation being given at the time as to how it would recoup this sum or earn a return on such a large outlay . ''
The report was highly critical of the service provided by PRO10 , particularly to the friends and family of athletes , saying it was `` inadequate and chaotic '' and that PRO10 's services were `` unfit for purpose '' .
The judge said the refusal of THG , PRO10 and Hickey to participate in the preparation of the report was a `` major impediment '' to its work .
On Monday , the OCI 's Keane said a contract was signed with THG to retain its services until the 2026 Winter Olympics and that it was possible THG would take legal action to enforce it .
The organising committee of the 2018 Pyeongchang Winter Games in Korea had rejected THG as Ireland 's authorised ticket seller , she added .
Ireland has been unable to find sponsors for the 2018 Games and will have to fund uniforms from its own resources , she said .

New Delhi : The Congress on Saturday accused the central government of having `` utterly failed '' on the national security front and said instead of taking strategic steps to protect India 's interests , it was relying upon rhetoric and yajnas .
The party 's communications in-charge Randeep Singh Surjewala alleged that the government has abdicated its duties in protecting the country 's borders and Prime Minister Narendra Modi has instead resorted to self-propagation of his strategies .
His reply at a Congress briefing came in response to a question on BJP MP Maheish Girri 's announcement to hold a yagna to ward off `` conspiracies by inimical forces '' .
`` Instead of taking strategic and diplomatic steps for protecting India 's national interests , they ( central government ) are relying upon rhetoric and yajnas . This is typical of all symbolism and no delivery style of the government , '' he said .
Last month , Girri had announced that a week-long 'Vedic yagya ' will be organised from 18 March at the Red Fort to blunt `` conspiracies '' by forces `` inimical '' to the country and said President Ram Nath Kovind and the prime minister have been invited for it .
Surjewala alleged that the government has abdicated its solemn duty to protect India 's borders both from external and internal threats and said the prime minister has `` utterly failed '' to stop the Pakistan-sponsored terror that is taking the lives of Indian jawans and civilians on a daily basis .
`` While yajnas and offering prayers are part of our philosophy and faith , the government can not abdicate its duties towards national security by just holding yajnas , '' the Congress leader said .
`` Modi ji is so busy in self-propagation of his strategies that he is blind to the threats on our eastern , western and northern borders which have become extremely volatile because the Chinese government has aggressively infringed upon India 's territory and caused serious concern by fortifying its military position on the Doka La plateau , '' he said .
Surjewala said that the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor is passing through Pakistan-occupied Kashmir and the Chinese now have a presence both at Gwadar Port in Pakistan and Hambantota Port in Sri Lanka .
`` Yet the BJP government remains a mute spectator and is relying upon rhetoric and yajnas , '' he said .
It became clear in the last election that a stark division existed between urban and rural areas . In places such as north Idaho , people with similar political stripes have begun seeking each other out .
When Adrien Koch retired last summer from her job with FEMA in the Bay Area , she and her husband resettled in the wooded mountains of north Idaho . They had visited only a few months before on a vacation but had quickly fallen in love . For Koch , Idaho reminded her of the California she knew in the 1970s .
‚Äú It 's kind of like a better time that 's gone by , ‚Äù Koch says . ‚Äú It 's a much slower pace , [ and ] people are more down to earth here . ‚Äù
Koch is 62 , with graying blond hair . She 's sitting on the couch in her Spartan living room . The house she bought in this quiet cul-de-sac is twice as big and half as expensive as the one she sold in California .
But that 's only one of the reasons why she left .
‚Äú I did not feel safe because of the crime has escalated and the element that has moved out of San Francisco , ‚Äù she says . ‚Äú So the farther out you go , yes , it 's less expensive , but it 's also more dangerous . ‚Äù
Koch instantly felt at home in small town Idaho . She says there are a lot of like-minded Christians . And as she 's gotten older , to her surprise , she 's become more conservative .
‚Äú I 've always been fearful of guns , ‚Äù Koch says . ‚Äú However , I am open now to learning , and the gun stores and gun clubs here in Coeur d ' Alene are very warm and welcoming . ‚Äù
Koch was also struck by just how many ex-pat Californians are here . They are everywhere : the gun shop owners , the retirees at the golf resorts . They hold seats on school boards and in local government .
‚Äú I immediately tell people , especially if they 're not from California , I am not one of those people who want to change Idaho , ‚Äù Koch says . ‚Äú I love it the way it is , that 's why we 're here . ‚Äù
While it 's long been a popular sport among longtime locals of the Mountain West to complain about the ‚Äú California-zation ‚Äù of states like Idaho , the fact is there has been a considerable demographic shift playing out in this region since the early 1990s .
That was around the time of the deadly earthquakes in California . There was a lot of racial tension after the Rodney King beating . Housing costs had already been soaring , and the outmigration of Californians moving to nearby states such as Idaho really picked up .
Since then , northen Idaho counties like Kootenai have seen their population double . Even as late as 2015 , the census shows that more than a quarter of all new residents moving to the state still came from California .
The idea that like-minded people like to live together and in some cases are seeking one another out is being put in renewed focus in the wake of the divisive 2016 presidential election . This is regardless of whether it 's in the more conservative rural areas or liberal cities .
The rural vote in the Electoral College played a key role in the surprise election of Donald Trump .
The Electoral College is weighted disproportionately to rural , now mostly red states like Idaho . So if you 're a conservative and you move up to Idaho from California , your vote has nearly twice as much impact .
This is not lost on people like C.J . Buck , who picked up and moved his entire business ‚Äî Buck Knives ‚Äî from Southern California a few years back .
Buck says his family manufacturing business ‚Äî they make hunting knives mostly ‚Äî decided to leave the Golden State because business costs ( primarily taxes and workers comp premiums ) were getting too high . And they did n't have to be there , he says .
‚Äú In Southern California , businesses are almost treated as necessary evils , ‚Äù Buck says .
Buck entertained an enticing tax incentive package from Portland , Ore. , but they settled on Idaho .
‚Äú We looked at Idaho as not having a major metropolitan area [ and ] that would mean as a state we would stay truer to those rural understandings , ‚Äù Buck says .
What he means is that there is n't a major city like Portland or Los Angeles that would swing Idaho 's politics to the left . Especially when it comes to minimum wage increases .
‚Äú The beauty of Idaho is , you just never lose connection ; it 's the people who need the jobs who are the ones voting on the issues , ‚Äù Buck says .
Business owners like Buck are hoping to rebuild a manufacturing economy in the region . Since the late 1980s , north Idaho has transitioned from a mostly natural resources-based economy to one that 's much more dependent on services , like health care , real estate and tourism .
‚Äú The economy has changed enormously , ‚Äù says Mary Lou Reed , a Democrat , who represented Coeur d ' Alene in the state legislature until 1994 .
Reed also moved here from California , albeit in 1956 . She recalls how north Idaho was once the country 's top silver producer and union Democrats once ruled up until the late 1980s .
‚Äú The lumber mills are all gone , the mines are shuttered down , we do not have labor unions that are active , ‚Äù she says .
Today , Kootenai County does n't have a single Democrat in an elected office .
For Reed , there 's one thing that no one talks about out in the open at least with all these demographic changes .
‚Äú We 're very , very white up here , ‚Äù she says . Kootenai County is 95 percent white according to the most recent census , compared with much of California today , where whites are in the minority .
She insists race plays a factor in some people 's decisions to move up here .
‚Äú No question the white flight is to flee from a multi-racial situation into one into in which everybody looks the same , ‚Äù she says . ‚Äú It 's very dull . ‚Äù
This is definitely an uncomfortable subject . Some of the transplants did n't want to talk about race as a reason for moving . Others said it did n't have anything to do with it .
After a few days , it became clear that race and politics are as complicated in northern Idaho as anywhere else .
Take the story of Anna and Luis Oropeza , who settled recently in a modest home in one of the many new subdivisions that are sprouting up in the pine forests on the western edge of Coeur ‚Äò d Alene .
They half-joke that they 're surrounded by fellow Californians in their cul-de-sac .
‚Äú Looking at houses , I 'm like , oh , there 's another Californian moving to the neighborhood , ‚Äù Anna says , laughing .
The Oropezas relocated last year from California . For Anna it was like coming home .
She grew up in the Coeur d ' Alene area . Her parents moved her up from Orange County , Calif. , in the early '90s . When they decided to move again , they were a little apprehensive at first .
Anna is white , and Luis is Hispanic . They 're raising two African-American foster kids and a Latina child .
‚Äú When I first moved up here people were like , ‚Äò Oh you 're gon na get the eye ' or whatever , ‚Äù Luis says . ‚Äú But it 's never happened to me . People are just as nice as can be . ‚Äù
The couple thinks this is a safer place to raise kids than the city they moved from in California . And they like the politics , too . Luis says Idaho is more live and let live .
‚Äú The laws are just way too strict compared to up here , ‚Äù he says . ‚Äú Here you can actually practice your amendment . A lot of people like the freedom . ‚Äù
A gun owner , Luis says that even he was surprised when he first walked into a store here and saw someone openly carrying and it was no big deal . In California he says , someone would call the cops right away .
KIEV/MOSCOW ( Reuters ) - A dissident Russian journalist reported murdered in Kiev on Tuesday dramatically reappeared alive on Wednesday during a televised briefing by Ukrainian state security about the killing , which they then said they had faked .
Authorities said Arkady Babchenko was shot dead at his flat and found by his wife in a pool of blood .
But he took to the podium before stunned reporters and said he had been part of a Ukrainian operation to thwart a Russian attempt on his life and expose those behind it .
‚Äú I would like to apologise for what you have all had to go through , ‚Äù said Babchenko , who looked on the verge of tears . ‚Äú I 'm sorry but there was no other way of doing it . Separately , I want to apologise to my wife for the hell that she has been through . ‚Äù
His reappearance elicited gasps , then cheers and applause from journalists at the briefing .
Babchenko , 41 , is a critic of President Vladimir Putin and Russian policy in Ukraine and Syria .
His reported murder sparked a war of words between Ukraine and Russia . The two countries have been at odds since a popular revolt in Ukraine in 2014 toppled a Russian-backed government in favour of a pro-Western one .
It also produced a flurry of condemnations from European capitals and Washington , and sent shivers through the journalistic communities in both countries .
This was in part because several prominent Russian journalists critical of Putin 's policies have been murdered in recent years . Opposition groups and human rights organizations say the Kremlin is behind the killings . The Kremlin denies this .
But there were signs of a backlash against Ukraine . Some media organisations said the staged plot undermined the credibility of journalists . Others said it had handed the Kremlin a propaganda gift .
Babchenko praised the operation , however , and thanked the Ukrainian Security Service , the SBU , for saving his life . He said the most important thing was that what he called other big acts of terror had been thwarted .
He later took to Twitter , promising to die ‚Äú when I am 96 after having danced on Putin 's grave ‚Äù .
STING PLOT
The SBU said it received information about a plot to kill 30 people in Ukraine , including Babchenko , but had thwarted it .
The security service declined to say who the other 29 people were but said it had detained a Ukrainian citizen recruited by Russia to find someone to kill Babchenko . He was given $ 40,000 to organise the murder , $ 30,000 for the killer and $ 10,000 for being an intermediary , the SBU said .
The detained man had been ordered to buy weapons , including 300 Kalashnikovs , grenade launchers , and explosives which were to be stashed in central Ukraine , it added . A video of the man being detained was shown to reporters .
‚Äú We managed not only to break this cynical provocation , but also to document the preparation of this shameful crime by Russian special services , ‚Äù SBU chief Vasyl Hrytsak said .

Mykola Lazarenko/Ukrainian Presidential Press Service/Handout via REUTERS ATTENTION EDITORS - THIS IMAGE WAS PROVIDED BY A THIRD PARTY .
General Prosecutor Yuriy Lutsenko , who appeared alongside Babchenko , said it had been necessary to fake the journalist 's death so that the organisers of the plot to kill him would believe they had succeeded .
Ukraine 's prime minister , foreign minister , the European Union , the United States and the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe were among the many to condemn Babchenko 's reported murder .
News that he was alive brought a mixture of relief and praise for the Ukrainian security services , including from President Petro Poroshenko , but a backlash from certain quarters about how the incident was handled .
‚Äú Reporters Without Borders expresses its sharp indignation on learning of the Ukrainian secret service 's manipulation carried out as part of an information war , ‚Äù Christophe Deloire , secretary general of Reporters Without Borders , said on social media . ‚Äú It is always very dangerous for states to play with facts and especially on the backs of journalists . ‚Äù
Poroshenko welcomed Babchenko with a hug at the presidential administration and said the journalist and his family would be given protection .
RUSSIAN MOCKERY
Russian state media mocked Ukraine for solving a murder it had staged itself , while the Russian Foreign ministry said it was happy that Babchenko was alive , but said Ukraine has used his story as propaganda .
The New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists said it was also unimpressed .
‚Äú We are relieved that Arkady Babchenko is alive , ‚Äù said the CPJ 's Nina Ognianova . ‚Äú ( But ) Ukrainian authorities must now disclose what necessitated the extreme measure of staging news of the Russian journalist 's murder . ‚Äù
But in Kiev journalists who had gathered in the central Maidan square to mourn Babchenko cracked open champagne .
‚Äú That was the best news conference in my life , ‚Äù said Olga Musafirova . ‚Äú I have never experienced such emotions at any official event . We watched ... at a studio of a TV channel and I realized that I burst into tears and it was tears of joy . ‚Äù
Another journalist , Sergiy Grishyn , said ‚Äú Babchenko will have to give me money for pills ‚Äù for the stress he 'd suffered .
Anton Gerashchenko , an adviser to the interior minister , who had announced Babchenko 's death on Tuesday , went on Facebook on Wednesday to compare the operation to the fictional detective Sherlock Holmes faking his own death .
Babchenko has lived in the Ukrainian capital since receiving threats at home for saying he did not mourn the victims of a Russian military plane crash .
Ukrainian Prime Minister Volodymyr Groysman had said in a social media posting late on Tuesday that he was convinced what he called ‚Äú the Russian totalitarian machine ‚Äù had not forgiven Babchenko for what Groysman called his honesty .

Moscow has described the allegations as part of an anti-Russian smear campaign .
China accused the United States of disrespecting Latin America after U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson warned countries in the region against excessive reliance on economic ties with China .
Tillerson , in a speech ahead of a visit to Mexico , Argentina , Peru , Colombia and Jamaica , said China was getting a foothold in Latin America , using economic statecraft to pull the region into its orbit .
In a statement released late on Friday responding to Tillerson , China 's Foreign Ministry said cooperation between China and Latin America is based on common interests and mutual needs .
‚Äú What the United States said is entirely against the truth and displayed disrespect to the vast number of Latin American countries , ‚Äù the ministry said .
Cooperation between China and Latin American countries is based on equality , reciprocity , openness and inclusiveness , it added .
‚Äú China is a major international buyer of Latin American bulk commodities , and imports more and more agricultural and high value-added products from the region , ‚Äù the ministry said .
China 's investment in and financial cooperation with Latin American countries are in full accordance with commercial rules and local laws and regulations , it added .
‚Äú The development of China-Latin America ties does not target or reject any third party , nor does it affect the interests of third parties in Latin America , ‚Äù the ministry said .
‚Äú We hope that relevant countries abandon outdated concepts of zero-sum games and look at the development of China-Latin America relations in an open and inclusive manner . ‚Äù
Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi visited Chile last month for a summit with Latin American and Caribbean countries , where he invited them to join China 's massive Belt and Road infrastructure program .
Separately , the U.S. Treasury 's top economic diplomat , David Malpass , on Friday accused China of enabling poor governance in Venezuela by propping up the socialist government of President Nicolas Maduro through murky oil-for-loan investments .
AURORA , Colo. ( AP ) ¬ó The Latest on the fatal collision of a van with a Denver airport train ( all times local ) :
3:40 p.m .
Police are investigating the possibility that the motorist hit and killed by Denver 's airport train intentionally pulled his van in front of the train before arrived at a crossing .
Police say the driver ignored an officer trying to stop him from entering the crossing before its gates and lights activated early Tuesday morning .

Then they say surveillance video shows that the driver waited for 38 seconds on the crossing 's first set of tracks before pulling forward to the second set of tracks as the train was headed toward him and the crossing lights were flashing .
Police Sgt . Chris Amsler says the van 's driver made no attempt to move the van and the train hit it .
An officer and a flagger were stationed at the crossing because of ongoing problems with the train system 's automated gates .
Amsler says the crossing 's gates and lights appeared to work properly during the incident .

A CEBU City cop was injured after he was shot by unknown assailants at N. Bacalso Ave. , in Barangay Bulacao , Talisay City on Thursday night .
PO2 Feliciano Yballe , currently assigned in Pardo Police Station , sustained a gunshot wound on his right shoulder .

SPO1 Erwin Carbonquillo of Talisay City Police Station said Yballe was on board his motorcycle on his way home when he noticed that three motorcycles were following him . The bonnet-wearing assailants fired shots after Yballe stopped at the roadside .
The victim reportedly retaliated and sent the assailants off .
Yballe drove his way back to Pardo Police Station and sought the help of his colleagues .
He was rushed to a nearby hospital in Cebu City and is now in a stable condition .
Senior Supt . Joel Doria , director of Cebu City Police Office , said he has already ordered a thorough investigation on the ambush incident .
Doria did not rule out the possibility that the strafing was related to Yballe 's job .
Yballe is part of the Drug Enforcement Unit of Pardo Police Station and is active in conducting surveillance on suspected drug personalities .
Pardo and Talisay City police offices are now conducting manhunt operation against the assailants .
In a big blow for the Board of Control for Cricket in India , the Supreme Court has removed Anurag Thakur from the post of BCCI President for not complying with the orders of the apex court with regards to implementation of the Lodha committee reforms . The Supreme Court also removed Ajay Shirke from the post of Secretary .
The Lodha committee had asked the Supreme Court to appoint an observer on December 15 , who would guide the BCCI in its administration , particularly with reference to the awarding of contracts , transparency norms , audit , etc. , for domestic , international and IPL matches to be played hereafter .
The court had a fortnight back , while hearing the case , hinted at appointing a panel of administrators as opposed to a single administrator .
The Supreme Court of India had also hinted at instituting perjury case against BCCI president Anurag Thakur for filing a false affidavit and reserved its order on the issue .
The Supreme Court said : `` BCCI case-prima facie we believe a case of PERJURY . We will launch a prosecution . Apologise if you want to escape , but even then we are not sure if we could accept apology . ''
The perjury case is due to the fact that the Lodha panel had informed the court about Thakur writing a letter to ICC chief executive Dave Richardson requesting for a letter from ICC , stating whether the appointment of a CAG official , as per Lodha panel 's recommendation amounted to government interference in BCCI .
In earlier hearings the court has rapped the board on the knuckles for not obeying that order , asking whether it believes `` it is a law unto itself . ''
In October 2016 , the court had frozen the accounts of the BCCI but has allowed release of funds to enable the board to hold cricket matches first with the visiting New Zealand side and then with England .
At the December 16 hearing , the BCCI rejected the Lodha Committee 's recommendation that former union home secretary GK Pillai be appointed as an independent auditor to scrutinise the grant of contracts by the board as ordered by the court .
PORTER TOWNSHIP , Mich. ( WOOD ) ‚Äî A convenience store employee chased and hit a retail fraud suspect with a snowplow in rural Van Buren County Monday morning , authorities say .
The incident started around 8:40 a.m. at the Country Lakes General Store on M-40 north of County Road 352 in Porter Township , south of Lawton .
The Van Buren County Sheriff 's Office says a man went into the convenience store and asked for $ 122 in lottery tickets . He then gave the clerk an old lottery ticket and left . The employee soon realized the ticket was not a winner , so he gave chase .
The clerk pursued the suspect , who was on foot , south on M-40 in his snowplow , eventually hitting the suspect . The suspect fell into a ditch , but got up and tried to get away . The clerk tackled him and held him down until deputies arrived .
The suspect , a 26-year-old man from Paw Paw whose name was not released Monday night , was hospitalized with possible broken bones and internal injuries .
After deputies finish their investigation , the case will be handed over to the county prosecutor , who will decide what charges are appropriate .

Athletics - World Athletics Championships - Men 's 4x400 Metres Relay - London Stadium , London , Britain ‚Äì August 11 , 2017 . Karabo Sibanda of Botswana picks up the baton as Anderson Henriques and Hugo De Sousa of Brazil exchange the baton .
LONDON ( Reuters ) - Botswana missed out on the men 's 4x400 metres relay final at the World Athletics Championships on Saturday after dropping the baton in their semi-final heat while the United States ran the year 's fastest time .
Bahamas , Olympic champions on the same track five years ago , also failed to qualify for the final as did Jamaica .
Botswana , among the title favourites , were fifth but quickly making up ground on the leaders at the end of the third leg of the second semi-final when Nijel Amos tried to hand the baton to Karabo Sibanda .
Sibanda took the baton but it slipped out of his hand and , as he went to pick it up , he collided with Brazil 's Anderson Henriques who was left sprawled on the track and had to be helped away .
Sibanda went on to complete the race and Botswana still finished sixth , ahead of Japan .
The U.S. , aiming for a seventh world title in a row , ignored the trouble behind them as they stormed away to win the heat in 2:59.23 ahead of Trinidad and Tobago and Belgium .
Belgium snatched third spot from Britain when Kevin Borlee pipped Martin Rooney on the final straight .
Britain still went through as one of the fastest losers as did France who were fifth in the heat in 3:00.93 but still faster than Spain , winners of the first semi-final in 3:01.72 .
Spain were followed by Poland and Cuba , the other qualifiers for Sunday 's final . Jamaica were fourth while the Bahamas , who also won bronze in Rio de Janeiro last year , trailed home in sixth .

Last week when US Ambassador to UN , Nikki Haley was asked about when a person of Indian origin will take to the highest office in US , she laughed and said , `` a woman of Indian origin is trying to survive this job . `` She may have made the remark in jest but over the past few months it does appear that US President Donald Trump 's core foreign policy team member is being outpaced by Secreatary of State Mike Pompeo and National Security Adviser John Bolton.The decision for the postponment of the crucial India-US 2 + 2 dialogue was taken in Washington DC but intimated to Haley , as our sources reveal , only hours before she went in for her meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi , the evening of 27th of June . This while she was in India holding crucial meetings through the day with Ministry of External Affairs officials and minister Sushma Swaraj.The decision to postpone the dialogue not just surprised and disappointed New Delhi but left officials at the American Embassy scrambling to put forth a credible excuse as this was not the first time the dialogue had been postponed . A source said had they been consulted , they would have conveyed to DC that this `` looks really bad '' . However , the person emphasised that the dialogue will happen and after the negative reaction from India , US is actively looking at dates.While the US is mulling end of the year as a possibility for the dialogue when Defence Secretary James Mattis visits India , a source did not rule out the possibility of it happening earlier . This as concerns have been raised that India would get into election mode by year end and ministers may not be readily available.India , on the other hand , is looking at a September-October window when External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj visits US for the UNGA summit . Sources indicated that the dialogue can be held in `` the next couple of months '' but as 4 principals are involved their convenience and availability will play a part . A source said that New Delhi is figuring out how to deal with this US administration that is `` not able to handle conventional relations '' as it runs behind a fleeting glimpse of a peace process alluding to Pompeo 's Pyongyang visit as a reason for postponment.However , the constant rescheduling has obviously left scope for speculation about India-US ties.From ongoing trade issues , to sanctions on Russia impacting India 's defence purchase to the pressure on US allies to reach zero import of oil from Iran - the relationship is struggling on many fronts . But as one source quipped , the American President is handling foreign policy much like he 'd handle business deals which also means there will be `` flexibility '' when needed .
President of the Dominica Association of Architects , Claude Lauture , has called on the government and the Planning Division to prevent construction in areas that are prone to disasters .
He said Dominica is vulnerable to multiple disasters such as hurricane , earthquakes , and landslides , among others , and there is construction in areas such as hillsides , close to precipes and flood zones .
He gave the example of what happened in Checkhall Valley .
‚Äú The river was dredged because of what happened with ( Tropical Storm ) Erika and with ( Hurricane ) Maria the river got back to where it was before Erika , and even more , and destroyed more houses in that community , ‚Äù he stated last week .
He said some concrete retaining walls were built but they all fell because of the power of the water and the river wanted to take back its bed .
‚Äú So , therefore , Planning Division should make sure that no buildings should be allowed to be built in such zones because it is high risk as it can destroy a lot of lives , ‚Äù he said .
The trial of terror-accused siblings Ebrahim and Fatima Patel is expected to start in the Kagiso Regional Court on Wednesday .

ZURICH : The International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) on Friday suspended Brazil 's national Olympics committee head after his arrest for allegedly arranging more than US $ 2 million ( 1.53 million pounds ) in bribes to get the IOC to pick Rio de Janeiro to host the 2016 games .
In addition to Carlos Arthur Nuzman 's provisional suspension , the Swiss-based IOC also suspended the Brazilian Olympic Committee and froze all IOC payments to the body . The IOC said Brazil 's athletes would not be affected , allowing them to compete in the 2018 Winter Olympics in South Korea .

Donald Trump has reportedly sent sharply-worded letters to several the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation ( NATO ) member countries including Britain ‚ÄìWashington 's most loyal battlefield ally in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan ‚Äì rebuking them for spending too little on their militaries .
The US president sent similar letters to the leaders of several NATO allies , including Germany , Belgium , Norway and Canada , warning that his administration was losing patience with what he said was their failure to meet security obligations shared by the alliance , The New York Times reported .
The letters sent in June , the report adds , are the latest sign of acrimony between Trump and American allies as he heads to a NATO summit meeting next week in Brussels . He has repeatedly questioned its value and has claimed that its members are taking advantage of the United States .
A strongly-worded letter to Britain 's defence secretary Gavin Williamson noted that Britain was one of the few NATO allies that had already met the alliance 's target of spending two percent of economic output on the military . But it said that was not good enough . Britain 's global role `` will require a level of defence spending beyond what we would expect from allies with only regional interests , '' the letter said .
White House spokesman Hogan Gidley , meanwhile , said on Tuesday that Trump will tell fellow NATO countries at next week 's summit that the United States can not be `` the world 's piggy bank '' .
`` What the president is going to do is go into these meetings with the mindset to protect the American people , stand with our partners and allies - but as he has said many times before America is thought so often to be the world 's piggy bank . And that 's got ta stop , '' Gidley had told reporters , as per a Reuters report . Trump has pressured some NATO allies to significantly increase military expenditure .
The letters show Trump 's determination to pressure NATO allies to significantly increase military expenditure , ahead of the summit in Brussels .
The US president also hinted that after more than a year of public and private complaints that allies have not done enough to share the burden of collective defence , he may be considering a response , including adjusting the United States ' military presence around the world , as per the New York Times report .
According to a report in The Independent , the NATO allies had agreed in 2014 to spend more on their own national defence , aiming to eventually contribute two percent of their GDP to the effort . Many members countries say they are still working towards that goal , and are frustrated by Trump 's threats .
Trump 's tumultuous relationship with NATO
Right from his campaign trail , Trump had declared NATO obsolete . Even during his first year in office , the US president had used NATO as a punching bag . He had often called members of the American-led security alliance in Europe as 'deadbeats freeloading on US defence spending . '
It took until Trump 's second trip to Europe last July for him to reaffirm America 's commitment to defend fellow members if they come under attack .
During a visit to NATO headquarters last year in Brussels , Trump had pointedly not mentioned US support for a critical portion of the NATO charter . He used his speech there to demand that members pay more for the alliance 's defence .
A senior White House official later had said the United States does , in fact , support Article 5 simply by agreeing to the terms of the charter .
But having not mentioned it himself , Trump sowed some doubts among allies and the ensuing controversy prompted Vice-President Mike Pence to later express explicit US support for the charter .
Senior aides to Trump had tried to get a statement of explicit support for Article 5 in the president 's NATO speech but it was not included , a senior administration official said .
But later last year , Trump again took a u-turn when he said : `` I 'm committing the United States to Article 5 and certainly we are there to protect and that 's one of the reasons that I want people to make sure we have a very , very strong force by paying the kind of money necessary to have that force . '' `` But yes , absolutely I 'd be committed to Article 5 , '' he had said .
'NATO ripping us off '
Then last month , Trump had fired off a volley of tweets venting anger on NATO allies in the wake of a divisive G-7 meeting . He had lambasted fellow members of NATO for paying disproportionately less than the United States to maintain the Western alliance .
`` The US pays close to the entire cost of NATO ‚Äì protecting many of these same countries that rip us off on trade ( they pay only a fraction of the cost - and laugh ! ) , '' he tweeted . `` The European Union had a $ 151 billion surplus ‚Äì should pay much more for the military ! ''
`` Germany pays one percent ( slowly ) of GDP toward NATO , while we pay four percent of a much larger GDP . Does anybody believe that makes sense ? '' `` We protect Europe ( which is good ) at great financial loss , and then get unfairly clobbered on trade . Change is coming ! , '' he had said .
His extraordinary outburst against NATO allies appeared aimed at striking a chord with voters who support his `` America First '' agenda . At the same time , however , it put Trump in the position of going into a crucial summit at odds with countries he needs on his side to pressure North Korea to move toward dismantling a nuclear arsenal that threatens the United States .

Harry Redknapp has made `` a good offer '' to John Terry in a bid to bring the former England captain to Birmingham .
Terry will be a free agent on July 1 after ending his 22-year association with Chelsea at the end of last season .
A host of Premier League clubs have been linked with the 36-year-old centre-half , but Blues boss Redknapp hopes to tempt him into the Championship .
`` I 'd love to have him at the football club , '' Redknapp told talkSPORT .
`` He 's a fantastic captain and great leader .
`` We 've made him a good offer and we have done the best we can . It 's up to John now , but we would love him at Birmingham .
`` He played for me the other week in Michael Carrick 's testimonial . I had John at the back with Jamie Carragher and I would have them two together all day long . They were fantastic .
`` I had a chat with him and said to him come in - he 's doing his coaching badges - have a year or two and who knows what he wants to do in the future ? ''
Top-flight sides Bournemouth , Brighton and West Brom have all been linked with Terry , as well as Birmingham 's rivals Aston Villa and clubs from the United States and China .
Terry has said he will make a decision on his future after taking a summer break to weigh up his options .
A cut of up to Rs 2.5 per litre in petrol and diesel prices notwithstanding , auto fuel rates in India are about twice the Singapore benchmark with taxes accounting for nearly half the current rates , Moody 's Investors Service said on Friday.The government this week cut excise duty by Rs 2 per litre as part of efforts to reduce the prices of petrol and diesel . Petrol in Delhi now costs Rs 68.38 a litre , down from Rs 70.88 . A litre of diesel now comes for Rs 56.89 as against Rs 59.14 previously . `` The retail selling prices of petrol and diesel in India even after the reduction is approximately 2.5 and 2 times that of Singapore benchmark prices respectively . As much as 42-50 per cent of the retail selling prices will continue to go to the government as taxes , '' it said.Falling retail prices could stimulate demand for petrol and diesel in India , which will be credit positive for oil marketing companies as it will result in higher earnings.Even though the consumption of petroleum products continues to grow , the rate of growth has slowed considerably from fiscal 2016 when prices were at their lowest , it said . `` We expect international prices to stay near current levels for the rest of the year as demand for heating oil in the coming winter months will be compensated by the return of refining capacity that was disrupted by Hurricane Harvey in North America . `` Hence more price falls will only be possible through further reductions in the tax component of prices . Rupee depreciation could be another source of price increase that may need to be compensated by the reduction in taxes , '' Moody 's said.In 2016-17 , the government got 23 per cent of its revenue from the oil and gas sector . `` Therefore there is limited flexibility for the government to reduce taxes further if it were to maintain its fiscal discipline . If prices rise , that would hurt demand growth , which would be credit negative for the oil-marketing companies , '' it said.Moody 's said the cut in excise duty on petrol and diesel will have no impact on the profitability of the three fuel retailers , IOC , BPCL and HPCL as they pass on any change in tax rates to consumers . `` There will be a marginal reduction in working-capital requirements of about Rs 20,000-25,000 crore ( combined for all three ) as the refiners pay excise duty to the government ahead of its recovery from consumers , '' it said commenting on Rs 2 per litre cut in excise duty on petrol and diesel.Retail selling prices have been increasing since July 2017 in line with the rise in international oil prices and had reached near record highs.Wednesday 's excise-duty reduction has brought down the retail selling prices of petrol and diesel by more than the excise-duty cut of Rs 2 per litre because the value-added tax ( VAT ) levied by the respective state governments are ad valorem taxes on fuel prices which include the excise-duty amount.In Delhi , petrol price fell by Rs 2.5 per litre and diesel by Rs 2.35.Prior to the cut that was effected from Wednesday , the excise duty on petrol and diesel was Rs 21.48 per litre and Rs 17.33 per litre respectively.Moody 's said despite the decline in international prices of petrol and diesel since 2014 , retail selling prices of petrol and diesel have stayed high in India as the government mopped up most of the reduction in international prices by increasing the excise duty .

SINGAPORE : CapitaLand , Southeast Asia 's largest property developer , on Wednesday ( Feb 15 ) said its fourth-quarter net profit surged 73.8 per cent , on the back of higher fair value gains and lower impairments .
Net profit for the three months ending December came in at S $ 430.5 million , 73.8 per cent higher compared to the same period a year ago .
Revenue for the quarter rose 6.5 per cent to S $ 1.85 billion , mainly due to the handover of development projects in China and rental income from its serviced residence business , the company said .
Net profit for the whole of 2016 came in at S $ 1.19 billion , an increase of 11.7 per cent from the previous year .
CapitaLand 's chairman , Ng Kee Choe , said the company faces `` an uncertain and unpredictable operating environment and economic headwinds '' in Singapore and China , its core markets .
In China , CapitaLand has more than 8,000 units ready for launch and expects to hand over 6,000 of them to buyers this year , president and group CEO Lim Ming Yan said . It will also complete 1 million sq m of retail gross floor area , comprising five shopping malls and the retail components of three Raffles City developments in China .
CapitaLand 's board has proposed a dividend of S $ 0.10 a share for 2016 .
SYDNEY : An Australian report into child sex abuse on Monday recommended new laws to compel clergy to report sex abuse allegations they hear in religious confession .
Current laws in most Australian states uphold the confidentiality of the religious confession .
A government-sanctioned inquiry into child sex abuse said it heard that some perpetrators who confessed to sexually abusing children went on to reoffend and seek forgiveness again .
`` Clergy should not be able to refuse to report because the information was received during confession , '' the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse said in a statement attached to the report on Monday .
`` Persons in institutions should report if they know , suspect or should have suspected a child is being or has been sexually abused . ''
The government did not immediately respond to the report .

The Royal Commission had previously heard that 7 percent of Catholic priests working in Australia between 1950 and 2010 were accused of child sex crimes and that close to 1,100 people filed child sexual assault claims against the Anglican Church over a 35-year period .
A royal commission is Australia 's most powerful kind of government-appointed inquiry and can compel witnesses to give evidence and recommend prosecutions , but it does not make laws .
`` Priests are able to say that they did n't have to divulge anything in confessional because of this privilege - this would change that , '' barrister Miiko Kumar , a legal academic at the University of Sydney , said of the commission 's recommendation .
`` It would make it absolutely clear that this should be an offence and a priest ca n't claim the privilege . ''
A similar rule , overriding the confessional privilege in Church law that prevents clerics from sharing information , was introduced in Ireland in 2012 .
A spokeswoman for Australia 's Catholic Church did not immediately respond to a request for comment .
Michael Quinlan , a legal expert at Catholic University Notre Dame in Sydney , previously told the inquiry that confession is a sacrament `` at the heart of the Catholic religious faith '' and to change its legal status would undermine religious freedoms . ( US $ 1=1.2661 Australian dollars )

NEW DELHI : The bodies of 39 Indian construction workers kidnapped in Iraq in 2014 by the Islamic State group have been found in a mass grave , India 's foreign minister said Tuesday .
Sushma Swaraj told the upper house of parliament the workers had been murdered by IS .
Their bodies had been found in the grave in the village of Badush northwest of the city of Mosul and taken to a local organisation for DNA testing .
`` Yesterday they told us that 38 samples had matched . The 39th had a partial match as he did n't have any immediate family , '' said Swaraj .
The 39 were abducted in June 2014 when IS jihadists overran large swathes of territory in Iraq and captured Mosul .
The victims were mostly from poor families in India 's northern state of Punjab and had been working for a construction company in Mosul when they were rounded up .

`` We got to know that these people were moved from Mosul to Badush by their captors , '' Swaraj said .
The minister said that when India 's junior foreign minister Vijay Kumar Singh and Iraqi government officials went to Badush , someone told them to inspect a mound in the village .
`` They said that they had buried many people there ( in a mass grave ) . We reached there and requested Iraqi authorities to use a deep penetration radar , which detected many bodies under the surface , '' she told parliament .
When the area was excavated , Indian officials found many identification marks such as non-Iraqi shoes and Sikh religious bangles .
`` We felt these were our people ... contacted a foundation working on the issue and shared missing workers ' families ' DNA samples with them for the identification process , '' the foreign minister told parliament .
The Indian government had never received any ransom demand or any other direct communication from the kidnappers .
India will send a special plane to bring the bodies home , said Swaraj .
`` Howsoever painful , the families will get the dead bodies after over three years . This will hopefully bring some closure to the grieving families , '' she said .
Islamabad : Pakistan Army chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa , on Tuesday , met with Russian Army Commander-in-Chief Colonel General Oleg Salyukov and discussed security and defence related issues .
Colonel General Salyukov said Pakistan is a geo-strategically important country and Russia is keen to expand its existing bilateral military-to-military cooperation , the Inter-Services Public Relations ( ISPR ) , the Pakistan Army 's media arm , said in a statement .
General Bajwa , who is in Russia on an official visit , thanked him and said that Pakistan `` reciprocates desire of enhanced bilateral military engagements '' , the statement said .
The Russian commander acknowledged the achievements of the Pakistan Army in the fight against terrorism and its contributions for regional peace and stability , the ISPR said .
General Bajwa said that Russia has recently played a positive role to help resolve complex situations in the region . He also said that Pakistan will continue to do its part to keep conflicts away from the region and seek approaches which bring regional convergences into play rather that the divergences .
Earlier , General Bajwa was accorded a guard-of-honour upon his arrival at the Kremlin Palace where he met the Russian commander .
His visit came a day after a high-level inter-ministerial delegation , led by National Security Adviser Lt-Gen ( retd ) Nasser Khan Janjua , visited Moscow on 22 to 23 April and held talks on defence-related issues .
Pakistan 's ties with Russia have moved past the bitter Cold War hostilities in recent years and the chill in the relations between Pakistan and the US , especially after President Donald Trump warned Islamabad for providing safe havens to terrorists , has further pushed the country towards Russia and China .
In 2016 , Russia held its first-ever military exercises with Pakistan and also started selling weapons to Islamabad .
Tweets , retweets , deleted tweets , disowned tweets . In less than 24 hours , one of America 's most popular TV shows came to a screeching halt , in a series of tweet-induced train wrecks .
The end came swiftly for Roseanne early on the morning of Tuesday , May 29 . After a controversial relaunch of the '80s-'90s TV hit in late March , the show 's namesake , Roseanne Barr ‚Äî lately known for her outspoken conservatism and wildly offensive remarks on social media ‚Äî took to Twitter at 2:45 a.m. on Tuesday with the following tweet : ‚Äú muslim brotherhood & planet of the apes had a baby=vj. ‚Äù `` VJ '' meant Valerie Jarrett , a former senior adviser to President Barack Obama .
Following outrage on social media , Barr deleted the original tweet and tweeted an apology to Jarrett just after 7:30 a.m. , but the damage was already done . By late morning , ABC announced the show was canceled .
‚Äú Roseanne 's Twitter statement is abhorrent , repugnant and inconsistent with our values , ‚Äù ABC Entertainment president Channing Dungey wrote in the network 's statement . Robert Iger , chairman and CEO of Disney , ABC 's parent company , tweeted : ‚Äú There was only one thing to do here , and that was the right thing. ‚Äù ICM Partners , by mid-afternoon , also dropped Barr as a client . ‚Äú What she wrote is antithetical to our core values , both as individuals and as an agency . Consequently , we have notified her that we will not represent her . ‚Äù
Barr has been vocal about her conservative views on U.S.-Israeli politics and , more recently , the relocation of the American Embassy . In the racist tweet that ultimately doomed her show , she directed her attack at one person : Jarrett , who has become a target of anti-Muslim groups because she was born in Iran and is also African-American . Dungey , who became ABC 's first African-American president in 2016 , was put in a difficult position ‚Äî ignore a racially charged tweet or set an important precedent on behalf of the network .
The celebrity 's ongoing Twitter behavior has not only included political views ; she also has used the platform on more than one occasion to amplify fake news and conspiracy theories . In this case , the tweet was prompted by combining a conspiracy theory and fake news claiming that Jarrett said years ago that she wanted America to become a ‚Äú more Islamic country. ‚Äù Investigative website Snopes concluded this to be inaccurate . As the day progressed , Barr realized her error and retweeted people who called for fact-checking .
Jarrett , appearing in an MSNBC town hall about racism in America on Tuesday evening , spoke about the day 's events and referenced the resulting cancellation of Roseanne : ‚Äú I think we have to turn it into a teaching moment ‚Äù about ‚Äú those ordinary examples of racism that happen every single day . ‚Äù
Meanwhile , Roseanne cast and staff took to social media to share their feelings . Sara Gilbert , Roseanne co-star on both the original series and the relaunch , and the reboot 's executive producer , tweeted : ‚Äú Roseanne 's recent comments about Valerie Jarrett , and so much more , are abhorrent and do not reflect the beliefs of our cast and crew or anyone associated with our show . I am disappointed in her actions to say the least . ‚Äù
`` It 's terrible that all the cast , writers and crew have to lose jobs because of this crap she decided to spew . I hope this incident is a step toward societal rejection of this crap. ‚Äù ‚Äîlongtime Roseanne writer David Raether Facebook

Former Roseanne writer David Raether shared his experience working on the show and his views on Barr , then and now . ‚Äú I worked on 111 episodes of Roseanne back in the 1990s . She was a brilliant and funny woman , and a difficult and demanding boss . In recent years she has fallen into apparently believing and fomenting a lot of conspiracy theories . It 's incredibly disappointing , ‚Äù Raether told L.A. Weekly . ‚Äú Her tweet about Valerie Jarrett was a new low but well within the spectrum of racist horseshit that she has been trafficking in for several years now . It 's terrible that all the cast , writers and crew have to lose jobs because of this crap she decided to spew . I hope this incident is a step toward societal rejection of this crap . ‚Äù
Roxane Gay , a prolific , acclaimed author and opinion writer for The New York Times , shared her insight , adding to an op-ed she had previously written about the show 's relaunch : ‚Äú For once , a major network did the right thing . But before it did the right thing , it did the wrong thing . It is not new information that Roseanne Barr makes racist , Islamophobic and misogynistic statements and is happy to peddle all manner of conspiracy theories . ABC knew this when it greenlighted the Roseanne reboot . ‚Ä¶ The cast , the writers and the producers knew what Ms. Barr stood for when they agreed to work on the show . ‚Ä¶ It was only when Ms. Barr became an immediate liability that everyone involved finally looked at her racism and dealt with it directly . ‚Äù
Those defending Barr have criticized ABC for canceling the show and are asking for a boycott of the network , using the hashtag # boycottABC . They also brought up a 2013 joke Bill Maher made about Donald Trump in which he said he would donate $ 5 million to charity if Mr. Trump proved he was not spawn of an orangutan . The joke was in reference to Trump calling for Obama 's birth certificate . Trump sued Maher and later withdrew the suit , but Trump backers have not forgotten .
Not wanting to add fuel to the fire , Barr tweeted : ‚Äú Please do n't start all of that boycott abc stuff ‚Äî I 'm not a censor and they have the right to do what they wish . It ' [ s ] all ok. thanks tho guys ! ‚Äù
By late afternoon , Viacom had ceased airing the original series on cable and Hulu ( partly owned by Disney ) had also dropped the show . Barr jumped back onto Twitter in the evening , posting several tweets apologizing to those who worked on her show . ‚Äú Do n't feel sorry for me , guys ! ! I just want to apologize to the hundreds of people , and wonderful writers ( all liberal ) and talented actors who lost their jobs on my show due to my stupid tweet . I will be on Joe Rogan 's podcast Friday . ‚Äù
Around 9 p.m. Pacific time , Barr tweeted : ‚Äú hey guys , do n't defend me , it 's sweet of you 2 try , but‚Ä¶losing my show is 0 compared 2 being labelled a racist over one tweet ‚Äî that I regret even more . ‚Äù
‚Äú I 'm sorry for my tweet , AND I will also defend myself as well as talk to my followers . so go away if u do n't like it . I will handle my sadness the way I want to . I 'm tired of being attacked & belittled more than other comedians who have said worse , ‚Äù Barr tweeted ( and deleted ) , as much for herself as for the benefit of her fans .
In an attempt to explain her original tweet , Barr made another joke that backfired : ‚Äú guys I did something unforgiveable so do not defend me . It was 2 in the morning and I was ambien tweeting ‚Äî it was memorial day too ‚Äî i went 2 far & do not want it defended ‚Äî it was egregious Indefensible . I made a mistake I wish I had n't but‚Ä¶ do n't defend it please . ty ‚Äù
Soon that tweet caught wind on social media , leading to a response from the company that makes Ambien : ‚Äú People of all races , religions , and nationalities work at Sanofi every day to improve the lives of people around the world . While all pharmaceutical treatments have side effects , racism is not a known side effect of any Sanofi medication . ‚Äù
Barr later removed her tweet about Ambien , but not before it had become a meme . Yet even as that festered , her fans were encouraging her to defend herself , comparing her remarks to others made by comedians and commentators .
Some of Barr 's tweets implored followers to stop defending her . Other tweets that she retweeted claimed she did n't know Jarrett 's race . Many had expected Trump to come to Barr 's defense on Twitter . Rather than reiterating his support of her show , instead , he tweeted about ABC and took the opportunity to lambaste the media . ‚Äú Bob Iger of ABC called Valerie Jarrett to let her know that ‚Äò ABC does not tolerate comments like those ' made by Roseanne Barr , he never called President Donald J. Trump to apologize for the HORRIBLE statements made and said about me on ABC . Maybe I just did n't get the call ? ‚Äù
Around the same time , Barr made a statement in defense of her own record : ‚Äú I 'm not a racist , I never was & I never will be . One stupid joke in a lifetime of fighting 4 civil rights 4 all minorities , against networks , studios , at the expense of my nervous system / family / wealth will NEVER be taken from me . ‚Äù
For Barr , the maelstrom kept coming . By midday Wednesday , her Twitter account had become its own reality show . In the first 24 hours following her damning tweet , she gained more than 70,000 new followers . Rather than shrinking away , she appeared to have changed her approach . In a follow-up tweet , she wrote : ‚Äú you guys make me feel like fighting back . I will examine all of my options carefully and get back to U . ‚Äù
Indeed , Barr may have lost her TV spot , but she has clearly retained her platform . The show wo n't go on , but Roseanne Barr 's third act may be yet to come .

The Nikkei Asian Review newspaper is reporting that the Japanese entertainment company Konami is blacklisting former employees in the Japanese video game industry . `` The company is particularly targeting those who work for Kojima Productions , which was founded in 2016 by Hideo Kojima , who used to be a top designer at Konami , '' reports Ars Technica . From the report :
As he attempts to accomplish the rare feat of returning from a ligament tear in his right elbow regenerated by his own stem cells , Garrett Richards expects the Angels to limit him to 100 pitches per start this season .
It will be a marked switch for the 28-year-old right-hander and likely No . 1 starter , who twice threw 115 pitches or more in April before the tear was diagnosed . Richards received a stem-cell injection , which enabled him to face hitters in September . He has been throwing since Jan. 4 in preparation for this season .
‚Äú I 'm assuming I 'll get my 100 pitches and we 'll go from there , ‚Äù he said Tuesday , when Angels pitchers and catchers were due to report at Tempe Diablo Stadium . ‚Äú That just means I have to be more efficient if I want to get deeper in games . I got ta cut down 20 pitches , and I got ta fill up the [ strike ] zone a little bit more . ‚Äù
He said he had not discussed the matter with the Angels coaching staff , and acknowledged the issues of a rigid cap .
‚Äú What if I get through seven innings at 98 pitches and there are two righties up to start the eighth ? ‚Äù he said . ‚Äú I do n't know what 's going to happen . But me being me , I 'm not gon na go , ‚Äò Hey , I 'm done . Here 's the ball . ' It 'll probably be something that I 'll battle for a little while until we get a good understanding . ‚Äù
He said he would n't push for a resolution during spring training .
‚Äú If I addressed the issue now it 'd be like I was addressing something that has n't already happened yet , ‚Äù he said . ‚Äú I think we just go , and when the situation comes up we decide what we want to do . ‚Äù
Manager Mike Scioscia said the team would use data to determine Richards ' workload . However , the information available is limited because few major leaguers have pitched after stem-cell injections . More have competed after platelet-rich plasma ( PRP ) injections , a related procedure .
Richards received a PRP injection in October , then rested 10 weeks . He threw his first bullpen session of the spring Friday ‚Äî all fastballs . He 'll wait until his third session , sometime next week , to work in his first breaking balls .
Depth perception
Scioscia said he was pleased with the Angels ' acquired depth . He noted the array of pitchers who could be starters or relievers on the roster , and praised the surplus of position players General Manager Billy Eppler established over the off-season .
‚Äú For the first time in a while , we have a lot of guys fighting for not only positions on our club , but positions within our club , ‚Äù Scioscia said . ‚Äú We 're excited about the depth of the free agents that [ owner ] Arte [ Moreno ] let Billy sign . ‚Äù
In signing infielder Luis Valbuena , outfielder Ben Revere and pitchers Jesse Chavez and Andrew Bailey , the Angels guaranteed $ 25.75 million to free agents ‚Äî more than they spent in any of the three previous off-seasons . But in the American League West only Seattle spent less , and Houston spent more than three times as much .
The Angels also spent $ 17 million on trade acquisitions .
Albert Pujols ' plan
Albert Pujols , an early arrival at spring training , flew to Charlotte , N.C. , last week for a checkup with Dr. Robert Anderson , who performed plantar fasciitis surgery on the slugger Dec. 2 .
Pujols said he was told he was progressing on schedule .
Pujols is hitting , playing catch and taking ground balls . He has not run since the procedure , which was delayed while Pujols waited on a shockwave treatment to take hold . It never did .
‚Äú I wish I had done it right away after the season , ‚Äù he said of the surgery . ‚Äú But we had to wait six weeks for this treatment , and it just did n't work out . ‚Äù
Pujols , 37 , played first base a career-low 28 times in 2016 . At the end of the season , he said he planned to play the position more in 2017 . On Tuesday , he called that a ‚Äú longshot , ‚Äù then deflected questions about his potential offensive output .
‚Äú I do n't have any expectations , to tell you the truth , ‚Äù he said . ‚Äú I just want to be healthy , and if I 'm healthy I know what I 'm capable of doing . ‚Äù
Asked how he felt about the prospects of playing on opening day , Pujols said he would leave that up to reporters .
‚Äú What happened last year ? ‚Äù he then said .
Last year , he beat doctors ' projections and recovered from foot surgery in November in time to start on opening day . However , he later lamented his lack of a traditional spring training .

Continental Fabricators Inc. ( CFI ) is an already established name in fabricating among refineries around the West Coast area of the U.S . Currently , the company is growing its presence on the Gulf Coast , and the leader of that movement is John Sloan . BIC Magazine recently visited with Sloan to learn more about his involvement in CFI 's growth .
Q : What led to your position at CFI ?
A : Actually , I was referred to Continental Fabricators by BIC Recruiting . They knew I was looking to add a partner company to my consulting group . We work with a few select companies to help them grow their business reach into the Gulf Coast . I partnered with CFI in February 2016 .
Q : What is the biggest news at CFI right now ?
A : There are a lot of things happening for Continental Fabricators right now . We have a major expansion in the shop facility underway , and we 've recently added some excellent key personnel . I 'd say the biggest news is the increase in overall business . We 've really seen a spike in activity , especially in the Gulf Coast , and it appears that trend is growing . We 've been fortunate to create and grow great relationships during last year 's slowdown and are pleased to be working with these folks as business is picking up .
Q : Are you looking to grow in new markets or expand in current ones ?
A : Continental Fabricators is extremely established in refineries and is particularly well-known for FCCU components and other complicated fabrications . With our full-service capabilities ( engineering , design , plate rolling , on-site furnace , etc . ) , we can handle things in-house other fabricators ca n't . The capabilities required to become a leader in that arena translate into a number of others in petrochem , syngas , midstream , etc . We are seeing a rise in inquiries from efforts made in these related markets .
Q : What type of clients mesh best with your style ?
A : People do business with people . As such , I focus on integrity , relationships and communication . The vast majority of problems in business come from an inability or unwillingness to clearly communicate . Good relationships foster openness and honesty in business , as they do in our personal lives . Our best clients are always straightforward people of integrity . We have the same kind of leadership in our offices in St. Louis . Clients enjoy working with our management , because they genuinely care about providing good service and quality fabrication .
Q : How do you maintain a good work/home life balance ?
A : My wife , Debbie , and I work with Continental Fabricators through our consulting company , Sloan Rangers . Debbie helps with marketing , emails and promotional events . Working together really helps us integrate home and work . In addition to providing consulting services for select companies like CFI , I also provide coaching services for Christian executives through a professional peer group association called Leaven Exchange . Our mission is actually to help business executives integrate the three chords of their lives : business , faith and family . Studying and coaching helps me apply these same concepts to my life . Without getting into too many details , I would suggest to others that it 's less about `` balance , '' which could indicate separation , and more about integration of the different aspects of our lives . Each part of our lives can and should support the others .

A good teacher or parent is like a good gardener . Your job is to find the inherent qualities of something that needs to thrive ‚Äì and find ways to make that happen . But what makes a good gardener ? In many ways good gardeners are like flowers . They have innate dynamics that are n't taught , but rather come about under the right conditions . Roots go deep looking for nutrients , and the pedals stretch upward in a heliotropic effect stretching outward toward the light . A good gardener needs stability and consistency , as well as the chance to find his or her source of light . As I 've been preparing a new book , which includes a review of the best interventions for parents , students , and teachers , one dynamic gets ongoing research attention . The results from the last dozen years indicate that the development of character strengths , more than anything else , is the best preparation for success . Teachers and parents , the gardeners among us , must find and use their own character strengths if they are to help nurture them in children .
Do you know what your character strengths are ? Do you know what these strengths are in the students in your life ?
A character strength is n't a skill , or something you 're good at . Rather , these strengths emerge through our feelings , thoughts and actions . One 's character is about the virtues we have and how they 're used . These traits , when used , can profoundly benefit you and those around you . Researchers Chris Peterson and Martin Seligman classified character strengths and virtues into 24 categories organizing them into six types . The character strength survey based on it has radically changed the focus of education around the world . The six virtues followed by their 24 character strengths are :
Wisdom and Knowledge : creativity , curiosity , open-mindedness , love of learning , perspective , innovation
Courage : bravery , persistence , integrity , vitality , zest
Humanity : love , kindness , social intelligence
Justice : citizenship , fairness , leadership
Temperance : forgiveness and mercy , humility , prudence , self control
Transcendence : appreciation of beauty and excellence , gratitude , hope , humor spirituality
The interesting fact about the research is that once teachers and parents know their top strengths and learn to use them in more and different ways , they are then in a very good position to do something called strength-spotting . When we acknowledge the use of strengths in others it has been shown to be the fastest , most effective way to build good relationships and help others succeed . In being able to strength-spot you not only activate the use of these strengths , you have an opportunity to influence them .
Learning about your strengths is the first step . You could glance at the list above and circle the top five . This would be one way to get a hint about what they are , but there is a free survey available for adults and youth that is accurate and helpful . Accurate because it is based on years of research from around the world about what traits are valued . Helpful because it gives you ways to expand your use and help others use theirs .
The research is impressive . Students who learned to identify and use their character strength did much better in school , enjoyed it more , and were more engaged . Could parents and teachers want better outcomes than these ?
I encourage you to learn about your strengths by taking the survey at ViaCharacter.org . The results are free , as are the articles on how to use them . Once you learn about your strengths you can help the student in your life learn about theirs . As Maria Montessori , the Italian physician who pioneered early childhood education around the world has said : ‚Äú The education of even a small child , therefore , does not aim at preparing him for school , but for life . ‚Äù

A major season that began with the Masters favourite falling down stairs ended with one of the game 's best young players capturing the PGA Championship , a reminder of the ephemeral nature of the most unpredictable of sports .
CHARLOTTE , North Carolina : A major season that began with the Masters favourite falling down stairs ended with one of the game 's best young players capturing the PGA Championship , a reminder of the ephemeral nature of the most unpredictable of sports .
Dustin Johnson was the focus of the golf world on the eve of the Masters , coming off three successive victories , having ascended to the world number one ranking and for a few months an unstoppable juggernaut .
Four months later , Johnson is almost a peripheral figure and Justin Thomas is the talk of the town , though the latter barely figured in discussions on the eve of the PGA Championship at Quail Hollow which finished on Sunday .
Instead , the media was obsessed with Jordan Spieth 's quest to surpass Tiger Woods as the youngest man to complete the career grand slam , while Rory McIlroy was the pre-tournament favourite , at least in the eyes of those who like to place money on the outcome .
But Spieth was never a factor at Quail Hollow , while McIlroy ended the week saying he might take an extended break in an effort to deal with pain in his back and left arm .
How do you make sense of it all ? It 's golf , a sport where almost every major offers a different cast of lead characters , and nobody takes the starring role more than occasionally .

‚Äú We won one of the majors , ‚Äù said British Open champion Spieth , the 'we ' referring to himself and his caddie .
‚Äú I understand that 's a great year in the majors . If I did this every year , I would go down as the greatest player ever to have played the game .
‚Äú Winning them is so difficult you can have a fantastic year without winning a major . Look at what Tiger ( Woods ) did in 2013 . He won five events , including a Players Championship ( but did not win a major ) . ‚Äù
Masters champion Sergio Garcia does not need to be told how difficult it is to win a major . The former teenage phenomenon was 0-for-73 until he beat Justin Rose in a playoff at Augusta .
‚Äú I did think about am I ever going to win one ? ‚Äù Garcia said after putting on the prized green jacket . ‚Äú I 've had so many good chances and either I lost them or someone has done something extraordinary to beat me . So it did cross my mind . ‚Äù
Brooks Koepka blew away the field in the final round to win the U.S. Open at Erin Hills , while Spieth produced an astonishing finish - five-under over a four-hole stretch - to edge Matt Kuchar at the British Open .
The PGA Championship , which plodded along laboriously for three days , suddenly came to life on the back nine on Sunday , with five tied for the lead at one stage before 24-year-old Thomas emerged triumphant .
Golf fans must now wait eight long months for the next major , during which time the spotlight will turn again to Irishman McIlroy and his quest to become the sixth man to complete the modern grand slam .
So who will be the next player to join the major champions club - Hideki Matsuyama ? Rickie Fowler ? Jon Rahm ?
Maybe it will be one of that trio , but it just as likely to be someone barely on the radar right now . That 's golf .

2016 is officially over , and we can say without question that Deadpool was one of the most successful movies of the year . It may not have made the most money , but an R-rated movie making $ 783 million dollars from a budget of just $ 58 million is incredibly impressive . Now , as things are ramping up for Deadpool 2 , more and more actors are throwing their hats in the ring to be in what will surely be a very successful sequel . Saturday Night Live star Leslie Jones has doubled down on recent comments she made , declaring she really wants to be in Deadpool 2 .
The SNL cast member made an appearance on Late Night With Seth Meyers recently and she was asked about her desire to be in Deadpool 2 . In December , leslie Jones tweeted at Ryan Reynolds directly , saying that she could be his sidekick in the Deadpool sequel and that her superpower would be her loudness . Here is what she had to say when Seth Meyers asked her about it .
`` Oh my god you read that ? Oh man , I love ... first of all , Ryan Reynolds has got to be one of the finest pieces of specimen . Hmph . Blake , you are so lucky , but Blake is bad too so , ya know what I 'm saying ? I wonder if they compare their badness to each other , like `` baby , I 'm hotter than you today '' ya know ? On top of that he 's hilarious , and Deadpool I would love to be just the sidekick , just feeding him back the lines . It would just be so funny . I just wan na be loud . Just `` waaaaahhhh '' ( screams ) , everybody 's clothes just come off of them . ''
There does n't seem to be a character from the Deadpool comics that fits the very unique and specific description provided by Leslie Jones , but new characters are added to the movies all of the time . So , assuming Ryan Reynolds and the producers of Deadpool 2 liked the idea enough , they could write in a part for her in the movie . The ball appears to be in their court at this point , assuming she is serious . It is hard to imagine she would say all of this if she were totally joking . Maybe her complimenting both Ryan Reynolds and his wife Blake Lively will help .
We still do n't know much about Deadpool 2 , but we know for sure that it is a major priority for Fox and that it will in all likelihood be released at some point in 2018 . Outside of that , we know that the time-traveling mutant Cable will be introduced , as well as the mutant Domino . We also know that director Tim Miller wo n't be returning to the director 's chair . He departed the project several weeks ago over `` creative differences '' with the studio and Ryan Reynolds . Instead , it will be John Wick co-director David Leitch at the helm for Deadpool 2 .
Zombieland writers Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick are returning to pen the script for Deadpool 2 , which is currently in pre-production . Fox is also reportedly already making plans for Deadpool 3 , so they are going to milk the Merc With a Mouth for all he is worth while the property is hot . If Leslie Jones gets her way , she will be able to get in on that action and hopefully be a part of a successful franchise , as opposed to what happened with Ghostbusters over last summer . You can check out the interview clip from Late Night With Seth Meyers for yourself below .

MIAMI COUNTY ‚Äî The Miami County Board of Elections continued to see vendor demonstrations on voting equipment this week after hearing from Clear Ballot on Thursday evening .
Miami County Commissioners Jack Evans and Gregory Simmons were also present at this vendor demonstration .
Clear Ballot Sales Engineer Keir Holeman and Regional Sales Manager James Rundlett highlighted their ClearVote Product Suite , a paper-based system . The line of products included an election management system , an ADA-compliant ballot-marking device , a precinct tabulator that is also a high-speed digital scanner , and vote visualization software .
Their vote visualization software ClearCount would provide visual verification of elections with scanned copies of the ballots . Holeman demonstrated how the software can organize the votes cast by each race as well as which votes would be considered valid , invalid , and questionable , such as overvotes .
ClearCount is also able to collect all of the write-ins cast in a race in one place , providing ways to adjudicate the write-ins more quickly than having a poll worker ‚Äú having to thumb through every single ballot , ‚Äù Holeman said .
Their election management software ClearDesign has a browser interface , although it is localized and does not access the internet , and it allows boards of elections to create their elections and design their ballots .
Clear Ballot 's ADA-compliant ballot-marking device ClearAccess offers a touch screen that prints out ballots that look exactly like the paper ballots that other voters would be voting on by hand . Rundlett demonstrated how the ClearAccess device could change viewer options or connect to a keypad for blind voters .
All of the ballots can then be submitted to and scanned by the tabulator and digital scanner ClearCast .
Rundlett also said during the meeting that Clear Ballot is in use in approximately 75 percent of the voting systems market in Oregon . They are also in use in Wisconsin and Colorado as well as in parts of Ohio .
The vendor demonstrations come after the board received a directive from the Ohio Secretary of State 's Office last year to determine their possible need of voting machines with the county commissioners . The county 's current DRE voting machines are also over 12 years old .
The board also held a Vendor Day last year , when they invited a number of businesses to display their voting machine products .

ROME : Italy was on tenterhooks on Wednesday ( May 30 ) awaiting news on a new government amid speculation of snap elections and the rumoured return of a populist coalition that collapsed at the weekend .
The continuing political turmoil nearly three months after an inconclusive election has raised concerns about the stability of the eurozone while talks between President Sergio Mattarella and his nominee for prime minister Carlo Cottarelli drag on .
Advertisement
Cottarelli , a former IMF economist , left the presidential palace without making a statement after informal talks with Matterella , not long after anti-establishment Five-Star Movement leader Luigi Di Maio ended his own meeting with the head of state .
The president 's office released a statement saying that no announcements would be made on Wednesday .
Di Maio and nationalist League leader Matteo Salvini abandoned their government coalition at the weekend after Mattarella rejected their proposed eurosceptic economy minister , Paolo Savona , despite parliamentary approval .
Cottarelli on Sunday pledged to deliver a list of ministers `` as soon as possible '' but by Wednesday , had still not unveiled his team .

Di Maio 's palace visit strengthened speculation that Mattarella was mulling fresh talks with Five Star and the League .
Five-Star leader Luigi Di Maio said the only solution was to approve the original lineup put together by the two parties and headed by their little-known PM pick Giuseppe Conte who renounced his mandate at the weekend .
But the League has so far refused to countenance a cabinet without Savona managing the eurozone 's third-largest economy .
Other than that , the only option was `` immediate elections '' , he said .
PARLIAMENTARY ANGER
Mattarella 's veto of Savona and subsequent nomination of Cottarelli as caretaker prime minister angered lawmakers , most of whom had been ready to back the eurosceptic as economy minister .
Italian media reported that if Cottarelli does manage to pull together a caretaker government , most were preparing to abstain - which would have handed him just a few dozen `` yes '' votes - but Di Maio said Five Star would vote against .
Parliamentary factions were trying to reach agreement over how long Cottarelli 's mandate should last before new elections are held , with officials from the centre-left Democratic Party calling for the country to the polls as early as July .
That could only happen if the parliament was dissolved before Friday .
A more likely scenario is Cottarelli holding on until autumn , with new elections likely in early October .
'SECOND-RATE GOVERNMENTS '
At a Naples rally on Tuesday evening , Di Maio appeared to revive the idea of a coalition government with the League .
`` There is a majority in parliament . Let this government begin . We are fed up with second-rate governments , '' he said .
But Salvini did not seem to be interested . `` I spent weeks in Rome trying to form a government . It was a futile effort , '' he retorted while campaigning in Pisa .
Instead , he said he would be ready for new elections `` as soon as possible , '' while rejecting the idea of holding them in July .
Salvini 's anti-euro , anti-immigrant party has risen in opinion polls in recent days .
Central to the party 's agenda is reform of the EU , spooking markets worldwide and caused a flurry of reaction in Brussels .
ANTI-EU UPROAR
On Tuesday , European Budget Commissioner Gunther Oettinger said he hoped Italy 's poor economic situation would keep populist parties out of government .
`` I can only hope that this will play a role in the election campaign ... sending a signal to voters not to hand power to populists on the right and left , '' he told German broadcaster Deutsche Welle .
His comments caused uproar in Italy , prompting European officials to scramble to calm anger at the perceived meddling by Brussels .
Financial markets have been on a rollercoaster ride over the past few days , but Milan stocks closed up 2.09 per cent on Wednesday , and the bond market strengthened slightly .
But investor doubts over Italy 's financial stability were far from eased , with the country struggling under a debt mountain of ‚Ç¨2.3 trillion .
Central bank chief Ignazio Visco had on Tuesday warned about the impact of the turmoil .
`` We are only ever a few steps away from the very serious risk of losing the irreplaceable asset of trust . ''
Canadian whistleblower Christopher Wylie is at the centre of an international scandal that allegedly helped the Trump campaign capitalize politically from private Facebook information . ( The Canadian Press )
Canadian expert says his analytics company helped Trump campaign capitalize on private Facebook info
The federal privacy watchdog says he 's concerned about the possibility that the personal information of Facebook users was harvested for political purposes .
Privacy Commissioner Daniel Therrien says his office will contact Facebook to find out whether the personal information of Canadians was affected by a major data leak involving the global social media platform .
A Canadian data expert named Christopher Wylie has exposed the breach in media interviews , saying he helped found a data analytics company that helped the Trump campaign capitalize politically on private Facebook information .

In a statement today , Therrien says his office has also offered to assist an investigation into the matter already launched by the U.K. information commissioner 's office .
Therrien says his ultimate goal is to ensure that the privacy rights of Canadian Facebook users are protected .
Reports by The New York Times and The Observer of London say U.S. President Donald Trump 's 2016 campaign hired data-analytics company Cambridge Analytica to collect private information from the Facebook profiles of more than 50 million users .
‚Äú Recent media reports regarding the use of personal information posted on Facebook for political purposes raise serious privacy concerns , ‚Äù Therrien said in the statement .
‚Äú Our office will be reaching out to Facebook to seek information regarding whether Canadians ' personal information was affected by the issues raised in those reports . That will help us determine possible next steps . ‚Äù

BENGALURU ( Reuters ) - India 's retail inflation likely breached the central bank 's 4.0 percent medium-term target in November after unseasonably heavy rains sent food prices soaring , a Reuters poll showed . A vendor arranges vegetable at his stall in a market in Mumbai , November 13 , 2017 . REUTERS/Shailesh Andrade/FilesIn the poll of more than 30 economists , annual consumer inflation , due to be released on Dec. 12 at 1200 GMT , was seen surging to a 13-month high of 4.20 percent in November from October 's 3.58 percent . The higher inflation rate is unlikely to push the Reserve Bank of India ( RBI ) to change its key rate any time soon , economists in the poll said . November 's heavy rains ‚Äú created lots of damage ‚Äù for perishable fruit and vegetable crops , said Rupa Rege Nitsure , group chief economist at Larsen & Toubro . ‚Äú We have seen that translated into price rises for onions , tomatoes and other perishable commodities ‚Äù . Increased house rent allowances for government employees and rising crude oil prices added to inflationary pressures alongside higher raw material costs due to the Goods and Services Tax ( GST ) rollout , she said . Wholesale prices are expected to have risen 3.78 percent last month from a year earlier , compared to a 3.59 percent rise in October . NEUTRAL STANCE At its Dec. 6 policy meeting , the central bank raised its inflation projection by 10 basis points to between 4.3 and 4.7 percent for the six months ending in March . It kept interest rates steady and stressed a neutral policy stance . The RBI cut rates by 200 basis points from January 2015 until August this year while food and energy prices were down . It is likely to keep them unchanged through the end of 2018 , according to a separate Reuters poll . ‚Äú Interest rates will remain stable for some time before they ( the RBI ) start hiking them because industrial growth is still weak , ‚Äù Nitsure said . ‚Äú Recovery is happening in a few sectors but it has not spread to all sectors and private investment sentiment also remains low. ‚Äù Industrial output growth eased to 3.0 percent in October from September 's 3.8 percent , as demand continued to suffer from disruption caused by the new national sales tax as well as last year 's currency clampdown that wiped out over 85 percent of the cash in circulation . But halting a five-quarter slide , India 's economic growth rebounded in the three months ending in September with businesses starting to overcome troubles from implementation of the new tax . ‚Äú We still have some output gap but it 's not as bad as it used to be a couple of quarters back . It will not make any sense for the RBI to just react to the ( inflation ) number . They also have to look at other factors , ‚Äù said Arun Singh , lead economist at Dun & Bradstreet India in Mumbai . The poll also showed India 's trade deficit likely narrowed to $ 13.75 billion last month from October 's near three-year high of $ 14.02 billion .

Spain stormed into the 2018 World Cup as Group G winners after producing a ruthless first half display to beat Albania 3-0 on Friday , sealing their place in Russia next summer as nearest challengers Italy were held to a 1-1 draw by Macedonia.Valencia forward Rodrigo Moreno marked his first international start by opening the scoring in the 16th minute , chesting down an outrageously stylish pass from Isco to swivel and fire into the top corner.Real Madrid midfielder Isco then shot high into the net in the 23rd to complete an equally impressive move of short floor passes between David Silva and Koke , while Rodrigo 's cousin Thiago Alcantara scored the third three minutes later with a thumping header from debutant Alvaro Odriozola 's cross . `` We are feeling very happy because we 've achieved an objective that was really important for Spanish football , '' said Spain coach Julen Lopetegui . `` It was very tough but we have done it while playing brilliant football . `` The only downside for Spain was a shaky performance from Gerard Pique , who was booed by large sections of the Alicante crowd every time he touched the ball following his support for last Sunday 's referendum on Catalan independence and was substituted by Lopetegui after an hour was up.Despite missing influential players such as Alvaro Morata , Andres Iniesta and Dani Carvajal through injury , the 2010 world champions looked as irresistible as in their 3-0 win over Italy last month , scoring three times in the space of 11 minutes.They set the tone with a sweeping team move early on which saw Rodrigo miss the target from a Jordi Alba cross , and the Valencia forward wasted another chance for an early goal when he headed a perfectly weighted cross from Isco wide.Rodrigo , who was recalled to the Spain squad for the first time in three years after spearheading Valencia 's impressive start to the Liga campaign , put those misses behind him with a clinical finish after being played in by Isco.It was the start of a rampant spell from Spain which effectively put the game to bed and killed off Albania 's faint hopes of a playoff place as they fell five points behind Italy , who are second in the group.Lopetegui 's side lowered their intensity after the break but still could have stretched their lead as Isco saw a free kick tipped over the crossbar and substitutes Marco Asensio and Saul Niguez each came close to getting on the scoresheet.Spain have taken 25 points and scored a remarkable 35 goals from their nine Group G games , only dropping points in their 1-1 draw away to Italy last year , and travel to Israel for their final qualifier on Monday with their place in Russia assured . `` Spain is one of the favourites to win the World Cup because their players have so much experience and today we saw their quality , '' said Albania coach Christian Panucci . `` The best thing about this team is the commitment , the passion and the enthusiasm shown by every player that has been with us , from those who played a lot to those who were only called up once , '' added Lopetegui . `` Without a doubt the attitude is the best thing about this team and if we continue to show the same hunger and humility we will be a great team .

Reporters Without Borders ( RSF ) accuses the Eritrean government of a complete denial of reality in its first-ever report to the African Commission on Human and Peoples ' Rights and announces that it has submitted an alternative `` shadow report '' with a much darker assessment of the state of press freedom in Eritrea .
The general trend over the past 10 years has been bleak , with an overall negative trajectory for press freedom . The major turning point was the election of Xi Jinping as General Secretary of the Communist Party of China in 2012 and President of China in 2013 .

Businessmen launch safe charity campaign
LAHORE ( Staff Reporter ) : Leading businessmen and the city government officials on Tuesday launched a Safe Charity Campaign to share a message with the general public that they must use their charity carefully and with all responsibility so that their donations could n't be used against the country . The Lahore Chamber of Commerce & Industry ( LCCI ) and the Lahore City Metropolitan Corporation jointly organised the campaign to create awareness and sensitivity among different sections of the society , as the volume of donations routinely increases during Ramazan . Sharing his views with the gathering , LCCI President Abdul Basit said ‚Äú Month of Ramazan teaches us to develop our society as healthy and loving. ‚Äù He urged the people to spend generously to support the needy and deserving people . ‚Äú We want to share a message with our people that they must use their charity carefully and with all responsibility , ‚Äù he added .
Speaking on the occasion , Peace and Secular Studies Executive Director Diep Saeeda pointed out that Pakistanis donate an estimated amount of Rs650 billion annually in charity , according to a nationwide study on charity trends . ‚Äú Only two percent believe that charity funds are misused while rests are not aware where their donation is spent , ‚Äù she said .
Basit said , ‚Äú We must remember that our donations should n't be used against our people and our country . We have to make our country a safer place to live besides reducing contributions to a cause that inversely affects peace efforts. ‚Äù He urged the people to make special arrangements to assist the poor and deserving people living in their surroundings .
Prominent religious scholar Prof Dr Khalid Zaheer said that everyone must contribute carefully and donate for deserving and needy . ‚Äú Charity is never obligatory but it is always additional . There is a noticeable increase in charitable work during the holy month , ‚Äù he said .

In its stride to achieve self-sufficiency in the energy sector , the present government took a number of initiatives which resulted in drilling of 179 exploratory wells and 194 appraisal/development wells . `` Subsequently , the Exploration and Production ( E & P ) companies made 98 new oil and gas discoveries with 40 percent success rate , '' official sources told APP .

Though it was billed as an evening with ‚Äú Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt ‚Äù star Tituss Burgess on Saturday night at the Sayers Club , there was cause for double celebration when moderator Yvette Nicole Brown announced it was also her birthday . ‚Äú I did n't say that to get applause , ‚Äù she noted . ‚Äú But just to say there is nowhere else I would rather be than with this wonderful man . ‚Äù
The cozy Hollywood club was decked out in velvet fuchsia walls with furs on the couches for guests , in an homage to Burgess ' lovable , flamboyant character Titus Andromedon on the hit Netflix show . Burgess talked about making the transition from theater ( where he appeared in such musicals as ‚Äú Guys and Dolls ‚Äù with Oliver Platt and ‚Äú The Little Mermaid ‚Äù ) to television . His first job was on ‚Äú 30 Rock , ‚Äù and he was an hour late to his audition . He almost did n't show up , but when he did , was shocked to realize they were running an hour and a half behind .
‚Äú 30 Rock ‚Äù was his first time in front of a camera , and he admitted to being confused . ‚Äú When they called ‚Äò cut , ' I thought they meant me , ‚Äù he revealed with a laugh . ‚Äú I thought I was cut. ‚Äù Burgess also shared that after shooting a scene with ‚Äú 30 Rock ‚Äù star Alec Baldwin , Baldwin told Burgess he was a great scene partner , which greatly inspired the actor . The two are now nominated against each other for supporting actor in a comedy at next month 's Emmy Awards . While this is Burgess ' third consecutive nod , he also spoke about landing his first SAG Award nomination this year , and how it was special because ‚Äú it 's from my peers . ‚Äù
After the Q & A with Brown , Burgess took to the piano on stage to play two songs for the packed audience . The first was ‚Äú All I Need , ‚Äù a song he wrote for the musical based on the 1996 movie ‚Äú The Preacher 's Wife , ‚Äù which is Broadway bound . Explaining that he saw the film as a teenager and it had a huge impact , Burgess began writing the music and lyrics even before he had obtained the rights to the film ‚Äî something he advised the audience to never do .
He then ended the evening with a rendition of ‚Äú ( One for My Baby ) One More for the Road ‚Äù before getting the audience to join him in singing ‚Äú Happy Birthday ‚Äù to Brown . Burgess also stuck around afterward to take selfies with everyone in attendance .
CAPE TOWN : An unbeaten 76 from opener Dean Elgar led a South Africa fightback as they reached 147 for four at tea on the opening day of the second test against Sri Lanka at Newlands on Monday .
Captain Faf du Plessis survived a dropped catch to contribute 38 to a 76-run partnership with Elgar as South Africa lost one wicket in the second session , having been 69 for three at lunch .
Sri Lanka struggled to make further inroads with Du Plessis the only wicket to fall as he attempted an expansive drive to Rangana Herath 's left-arm spin and was caught at first slip by Angelo Mathews .
Elgar and Du Plessis had both played measured innings sprinkled with a few aggressive shots to revive the hosts after early problems .
Du Plessis was dropped on 31 by Upul Tharanga off Herath but it did not prove expensive as the veteran spinner got his man soon afterwards .
Before lunch , teenage seamer Lahiru Kumara claimed two quick scalps on a bowler-friendly surface , dismissing Hashim Amla and JP Duminy in the same over .
Amla , continuing his indifferent form , was clean bowled for 29 and five balls later Duminy gloved a quick leg-side delivery to be caught after an acrobatic leap by wicketkeeper Kusal Mendis .
Sri Lanka won the toss and decided to bowl on a green strip , making an immediate breakthrough before South Africa had scored a run with the fourth ball of the match .
Stephen Cook , who scored a century and was named man of the match in the first test in Port Elizabeth , pushed at a rising delivery from Suranga Lakmal and got a faint edge to Mendis .
The 21-year-old had taken over the gloves from Dinesh Chandimal , who is playing but was feeling unwell at the start of play .
Inconsistent bowling allowed Elgar and Amla to weather the next 21 overs and establish a 66-run partnership before the 19-year-old Kumara , playing only his third test , was brought into the attack .
The teenager replaced Dushmantha Chameera in the line-up for the second test in one of two changes for Sri Lanka , who lost by 206 runs in Port Elizabeth in the first game of the three-match series .

EDINBURGH : A retelling of Britain 's vote to leave the European Union and its dramatic political consequences might perhaps be framed as high drama or extreme farce .
But audiences at the Edinburgh Festival are lapping up a light-hearted sung comedy version , `` Brexit The Musical '' , a sellout featuring a cavorting Boris Johnson , the most prominent Brexit campaigner , in matching Union Jack underpants and socks , looking for a lost plan .
On hearing the news that `` Leave '' has won , Johnson , who in reality surprised many with his decision to campaign to leave the EU and is now Britain 's foreign secretary , sings in horror : `` Leaving Europe will be a catastrophe/ Overnight we 'll bugger the economy . ''
Britons voted to leave the EU in June 2016 , but since then a host of unforeseen political consequences , including a snap election in which the Conservative government lost its majority , have mired the country in uncertainty . There is still no clarity about what Brexit will mean in practical terms .
In the comedy version , David Cameron is relieved , once he has resigned as prime minister after the vote , that he no longer has to pretend to be an ordinary man of the people . Michael Gove , Boris 's pro-Leave sidekick and in reality now agriculture secretary , sports a tartan dressing gown and fluffy slippers and just wants to be liked .
And for the leader of the main opposition Labour Party , Jeremy Corbyn , the Brexit vote means above all that he has to miss the Glastonbury music festival .

With the political outlook still confused a year after the Brexit vote took place , the show 's writer , 39-year-old EU trade lawyer Chris Bryant , told Reuters the show was meant as `` an escape from the dreary reality of where we are '' .
An almost-happy ending , which can not be revealed in print , is the stuff of fiction , he said . Bryant thinks it more likely that Britain will end up cutting all formal ties with the EU .
`` I think we are heading towards a colossal mess , and I 'm of the view that we will end up with a 'hard Brexit ' almost by accident , rather than by design . ''
The show will run for the whole month of the Festival , and Bryant hopes to take it to London .

Hollywood has been rocked by the reports of Weinstein 's behavior which broke this week after years of rumors and innuendo .
‚Äú I do not know all the women who have come forward per the New York Times piece on Harvey Weinstein and I am not a fan of many of them , in many ways , especially of their politics ( I am certain they are not too fond of me or mine as well ! ) , ‚Äù Rock wrote on his official website .
‚Äú But I applaud their courage to come forward and support them all 100 % . Most of us in the entertainment business have heard of these disgusting stories for years about these scumbag heads of studios , record labels , Fortune 500 companies , etc and how they prey on young women and men , especially in Hollywood , ‚Äù he continued .
‚Äú Why even comment on this and put my own neck out there in a fight that 's not mine ? For my granddaughter , my sisters , my mother , my fianc√© , but mostly for the people who have no voice . And I am also not beholden or scared of anyone ! , ‚Äù the rocker added .
‚Äú Once again , I support you ladies and I am sure you will not be the last to come forward now that the dam has burst , ‚Äù Kid Rock wrote at the end of the post . ‚Äú I do wish for the most positive outcomes for all involved and for some real change in this disgusting space . ‚Äù

TORONTO ‚Äî Ontario Premier Kathleen Wynne is suing the Opposition leader for defamation .
A spokeswoman for Wynne says a statement of claim was filed on Monday in order for the premier to be able to continue with her case against Patrick Brown .
Wynne 's lawyer first demanded in a letter in September that Brown withdraw comments he made a day before the premier testified as a witness at a trial in Sudbury involving two provincial Liberals facing Election Act bribery charges .
Brown had told reporters he hoped Wynne would give answers about the scandal ‚Äú maybe when she stands trial ‚Äù and went on to describe her as a ‚Äú sitting premier , sitting in trial . ‚Äù
Brown refused to apologize for the statements both after the initial lawyer 's letter and following a libel notice in October .
Wynne 's spokeswoman says this case can be resolved with an apology from Brown , but if he continues to refuse to apologize the premier will be able to continue the legal action .
Exxon Mobil Corp 's chief executive said on Wednesday that he hopes the new attorney general in New York `` comes to a different conclusion '' than predecessor Eric Schneiderman on a climate change probe into the world 's largest publicly traded oil producer .
DALLAS : Exxon Mobil Corp 's chief executive said on Wednesday that he hopes the new attorney general in New York `` comes to a different conclusion '' than predecessor Eric Schneiderman on a climate change probe into the world 's largest publicly traded oil producer .
Schneiderman , who resigned earlier this month after allegations of physical abuse by four women that he denied , had alleged Exxon withheld information about its internal climate change discussions and misled the public about what it knew . Exxon has long denied the charges .

The investigation has spread to other states , including Massachusetts , and has put Exxon squarely in the middle of the ongoing debate about fossil fuels and climate change .
CEO Darren Woods , who spoke at Exxon 's annual shareholder meeting in Dallas , said he was `` committed to being part of the solution on climate change . ''
Woods added he has not reached out to Barbara Underwood , who was appointed to replace Schneiderman . He said he was not sure if Exxon attorneys have talked to Underwood or her office .
`` I 'm real confident on where we stand . I hope whoever comes in steps back and takes an objective look ... and comes to a different conclusion , '' Woods said .

Underwood , a Democrat appointed by the New York State Legislature , has said she will not run for election to a full term this November . At least six candidates of various political backgrounds have announced their candidacies .
`` Let 's see what that election brings , '' Woods said .
New York State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli , who oversees state pension funds that hold about 11.5 million Exxon shares , has also long criticized the company 's response to climate change and voted against a slate of 10 board nominees at the company 's annual meeting .
`` The fund can not support board directors who refuse to acknowledge substantial risks to Exxon 's bottom line and fail to help it transition to a lower carbon future , '' DiNapoli said in a statement . All 10 board nominees were approved .

Google has beaten Facebook to become publishers ' main source of external page views over the course of 2017 , a new data showed . Google used to be the main source of referral traffic for web publishers . Then Facebook eclipsed it , ReCode reported late on 11 December .
According to digital analytics company Parse.ly , Google sent more traffic than Facebook to publishers ‚Äî Facebook sent 25 percent less traffic to publishers in 2017 , while Google increased its traffic by 17 percent .
In January , Facebook provided nearly 40 percent of publishers ' external traffic which is now down to 26 percent . Google , which started the year at 34 percent , generated 44 percent of the total traffic .
Parse.ly pointed out a number of factors for this turnaround . In 2016 Facebook tweaked its algorithm to prioritise posts from friends and family over publishers .
Also , Facebook 's `` Instant Articles '' feature , where the service hosted some publishers ' content directly but promised to send more readers to the original site as well , has declined in importance , the analytics company found .
Since users can now publish videos directly on Facebook , this might have affected how many links to web stories publishers put on their Facebook pages .
Google 's `` accelerated mobile pages '' ( AMP ) feature , which also hosts publishers ' content directly on Google 's servers , became more important over the year . AMP stories ‚Äî typically from news publishers - are surfaced at the top of mobile search results as `` Top Stories , '' which drives clicks .
Depending on a provocative and often unpredictable star such as Barr ‚Äî who had the benefit of mass success in the pre-digital TV era of the 1990s ‚Äî was a gamble and ABC executives knew it . The fact they were willing to take such a risk demonstrates just how hungry they were to recapture some of the network 's past glory that had been dimmed in recent years by the public 's shift to streaming online video and on-demand viewing .
Things looked bleak for Catholic Central , which was on the brink of defeat trailing 4-2 with two outs in the top of the seventh .
But sophomore Christina Paleka capped a 3-for-4 day with a blooper into center and legged out a double to keep the Toppers alive . Then , Robson worked the count before crushing an RBI double to right-center .
Finally , Anne Fabiani lined a base hit up the middle to score Robson and tie the game at 4-4 .
Catholic Central 's momentum quickly dissipated , however .
Oakfield led off their last at-bat with a double to right-center , and the next batter laid down a bunt . Freshman first baseman Katie Goethal charged and tried to make a play at third to eliminate the winning run , but the ball trickled past Laine Dirksmeyer and the game was over .
The Oaks leaped in ecstasy while the Toppers agonized in defeat .
‚Äú We had the bases loaded early in the game and one out , and hitters that I trusted , and it just did n't work out , ‚Äù said Catholic Central coach Bill Greskiw . ‚Äú That was probably more responsible for us not jumping on that opportunity than the last inning . The last inning , we got lucky enough to have a second opportunity . A lot of times against a team like that , you do n't get a second opportunity . ‚Äù
In the second inning , after Fabiani and Paleka singles along with a Robson walk loaded the bases , the team 's other senior , Emily Swanson , hit an RBI single to tie the game at 2-2 . The Toppers stranded the bases loaded .
‚Äú It does n't feel real , I do n't think it 's set in yet , ‚Äù Swanson said . ‚Äú Once I do n't go to practice , I think that will be it . I 'm proud of us , though . ‚Äù
Robson and Oakfield 's pitcher settled down on the mound in the next two innings before Robson got into trouble in the fifth .
After she retired the first two batters with weak infield pop-ups , Robson grooved one to Brianna Sabel , who launched a solo home run over the center-field fence to give the Oaks a 3-2 lead .
‚Äú I called the wrong pitch on that home run , ‚Äù Greskiw said . ‚Äú That 's what I go home with . ‚Äù
The next batter popped up to center field for what looked like the final out , but Morgan Dietzel misjudged the ball and it dropped behind her for a double . The Oaks capitalized on the mistake , as the next batter doubled to extend the lead to 4-2 .
That campaign platforms have become almost meaningless in elections is perfectly illustrated by what 's going on in Ontario right now .
If the polls are accurate , the 15-year Liberal dynasty now headed by Premier Kathleen Wynne will end June 7 .
At the start of the race , on May 9 , it was Progressive Conservative leader Doug Ford 's to lose , as the PCs had a huge lead in the polls .
Now they show Ford in a neck-and-neck race with NDP leader Andrea Horwath .
Horwath and Wynne have attacked Ford for not releasing a ‚Äú fully costed ‚Äù campaign platform .
While Ford and the PCs released on Wednesday a list of costed promises with potential savings , their platform lacks a detailed fiscal plan , which the other campaigns have .
But those plans are also full of gaping holes and it 's not the first time .
For example , during the 2014 election campaign , where Wynne won a majority government , she never said a word in her platform about the huge tax hike she imposed on Ontarians post-election .
That was cap and trade , which now takes almost $ 2 billion annually out of the pockets of Ontarians .
Not only did Wynne not mention this during the 2014 campaign , following her victory she said she had no plans to introduce a carbon tax .
What she did n't say was that she would introduce cap and trade , a carbon tax by another name , in 2017 .
Also in 2014 , Wynne promised to cut Ontario auto insurance rates by an average of 15 % by August 2015 .
Post-election , after failing to do this , she dismissed it as a ‚Äú stretch goal ‚Äù , a novel way of describing a broken promise .
In this election , Wynne 's fiscal plan , outlined in the Liberals ' March 27 budget , underestimates by almost 100 % projected Liberal government deficits over the next five years , according to Ontario 's Auditor General and Financial Accountability Office .
Wynne and the Liberals have cavalierly responded by ignoring these findings , insisting their numbers are right and not those of two independent , non-partisan , financial watchdogs who report to the legislature , not just the government of the day .
Meanwhile , NDP leader Horwath had to admit her ‚Äú fully costed ‚Äù platform underestimated its combined annual deficits over five years by $ 7 billion , because the NDP wrongly counted a $ 700 million annual cost item ‚Äî a reserve fund ‚Äî as revenue .
But Horwath magically insists this will have no impact on her promises .
The platform released by Ford and the PCs Wednesday does n't provide a fiscal outlook explaining how Ford plans to pay for his promises , and their impact on the province 's finances , year by year .
Their numbers are also hard to believe .
Ford says he 'll find 4 % worth of ‚Äú efficiencies ‚Äù in government over four years ‚Äî without saying what they will be ‚Äî to pay for a 20 % income tax cut and other promises such as a 10-cent-a-litre gasoline tax cut and scrapping cap and trade .
This while Ford has pledged not to lay off one public servant . He 's also promised to balance the budget within four years , which neither Horwath nor Wynne say they will do .
The problem for voters is that when election platforms can be stretched like Silly Putty , and broken promises dismissed as ‚Äú stretch goals ‚Äù ( like Justin Trudeau 's 2015 broken promise of three years of ‚Äú modest deficits ‚Äù followed by a balanced budget ) , it 's time to describe them for what they really are .
Works of fiction .

In what 's becoming a recurrent staple of US overseas adventurism , over half the US $ 76 billion worth of US military aid sent to Afghan security forces since 2002 has been `` looted and embezzled , '' according to a former intelligence officer , due to `` brazen corruption '' that has seen money and weapons siphoned to private militias.He called for greater efforts in Washington and Kabul to uncover corruption , and suggested there should be a halt on further aid until the missing equipment was accounted for.While US $ 76 billion in military aid was `` enough '' to last Afghanistan for 40 years without any corruption , he said , not even half of it was left as of August 2017.In 2005 , the Afghanistan Security Forces Fund was created , and around US $ 66 billion has been allocated since then . The bulk of funds - over US $ 26 billion - was spent on `` sustainment '' such as salaries , ammunition , equipment maintenance , information technology and clothing , with around US $ 18 billion going on transport , infrastructure projects , operations and training.Among the hardware provided were 600,000 small arms such as handguns and rifles , 163,000 radios , 76,000 vehicles ( including 22,000 Humvees ) , and 30,000 pieces of bomb disposal equipment.Around 16,000 intelligence and surveillance items , such as unmanned surveillance drones , and 208 aircraft , including 110 helicopters , were also part of the haul.Small arms are said easily stolen and sold on Afghanistan 's black market . Sometimes , the weaponry ends up in the hands of militants fighting security forces . Small arms such as pistols often end up in the hands of criminal elements - both organized and amateur as well.Rampant corruption among Afghan security forces has led President Ashraf Ghani to establish the Justice and Judicial Center for Anti-Corruption , and the National Procurement Council to oversee major public sector contracts.Such corruption fighting efforts have seen a former police chief in the southern province of Helmand jailed for three years for selling police district chief posts and appointing `` ghost '' officers in order to pocket their salaries.In Iraq , and other countries , the almost unending abundance of such weapons on the black market has made post-intervention reconstruction even more difficult , empowering militias and criminal gangs and enfeebling the power of authorities . A 2016 Action on Armed Violence report that pooled 14 years ' worth of Pentagon contract information related to rifles , pistols , machine guns , associated attachments and ammunition - both for American troops and partners and proxies - found the Pentagon provided at least 1.45 million firearms to various security forces in Afghanistan and Iraq , including more than 978,000 assault rifles , 266,000 pistols and almost 112,000 machine guns.Much of this epic arsenal was given no questions asked to local armies and militias that subsequent reports have often demonstrated to be plagued with corruption , poor or non-existent training , desertion and human rights abuses.As a result , it is perhaps unsurprising so many weapons have flown from their hands and into the care of unsavory , dangerous regional elements .
Arizona gets home runs from A.J . Pollock , J.D . Martinez , Ketel Marte and Jeff Mathis against Clayton Kershaw , but still fall short in Game 1 . ( 1:02 )
LOS ANGELES -- Dodgers ace Clayton Kershaw became the first pitcher in franchise history to allow four homers in a postseason game , giving up four solo shots Friday in Los Angeles ' 9-5 win over the Arizona Diamondbacks in Game 1 of the National League Division Series .
Kershaw became the first pitcher to give up that many homers and still win a postseason outing and , continuing a night of firsts , he also recorded his first playoff win at Dodger Stadium .
Editor 's Picks Justin Turner 's big night fuels Dodgers to 1-0 series lead L.A. 's third baseman had 5 RBIs as the Dodgers shook off a shaky start from Clayton Kershaw to top the D-backs in Game 1 .
`` As great of a pitcher and career that he 's had , that 's surprising , '' Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said . `` I 'm glad I was part of his first postseason home win . ''
Kershaw entered the game with a 4.55 career playoff ERA , well above his career regular-season mark of 2.36 . He pitched into the seventh inning against Arizona , giving up only five hits despite the four homers . Afterward , the long-ball barrage was mostly shrugged off by the Dodgers in the afterglow of their win .
All four homers Kershaw gave up were solo shots : A.J . Pollock in the third and J.D . Martinez in the sixth , then back-to-back homers in the seventh by Adam Rosales and Ketel Marte . They were the last hitters Kershaw faced .

`` For him , that part of the order , I felt good with him going back out there , '' Roberts said . `` Obviously , there was some hard contact from that part of the order , and it was nice to go to the pen there . ''
Kershaw admitted that by that point he was fatigued .
`` I just did n't have much left , I do n't know , '' Kershaw said . `` Hopefully when you give up hits , maybe one or two would stay in the ballpark . But tonight it did n't seem like that was going to happen . ''
The Dodgers had built a 7-1 lead by the time that Kershaw gave up his last trio of homers , something teammate Justin Turner pointed out changes the context of the homers as more of an oddity than anything .
`` I thought he was outstanding and challenged guys , pitching with the lead , like he should , '' Turner said . `` Yeah , he gave up four solo homers , but who cares ? When you have a lead like that , it 's about attacking guys . ''

Started From the Bottom : Student Businesses
Students at California Lutheran University are doing what they love and succeeding because of it . Junior Roemello Ugale , senior Dani Kluss and senior Victoria Lahney are letting their talents work for them in their personal businesses .
Ugale is a full-time student and works more than one job to pay bills . To further generate income , he turned his passion for cutting hair into a business . Ugale said he thinks student businesses , including his own , are deserving of recognition .
‚Äú When you go to a new barber , you know nothing about this person , you do n't know if he 's good or bad , you just do n't know him , and it 's kind of hard to trust someone you do n't know , ‚Äù Ugale said . ‚Äú I think student businesses are cool because I 've had a lot of people just come up to me and ask if I cut hair , and I 'm like yeah , and they already have an idea of who I am , I think it 's easier to trust something that 's more familiar . ‚Äù
Ugale used to cut hair for a few people when he first started , but now he has regular customers and a growing clientele . For Ugale , cutting hair is a personal act because it allows him to produce a tangible product of his imagination .
‚Äú You 're kind of making someone 's image at the same time . Whenever I put my clippers on someone 's head , I 'm doing it my way , my style , it 's how I interact with people , it 's my own style , ‚Äù Ugale said .
Kluss , like Ugale , has transformed her passion into a business as well . She created a personal blog that later blossomed into a successful and resourceful platform for college students .
‚Äú It started out more than just sharing what was going on in my life , and it turned into this huge thing , which was really unexpected , and it became a great way to help people and to talk about my college experience and everything , ‚Äù Kluss said .
Since the inception of her blog , Kluss said she has received many responses from her audience , including messages of gratitude for her advice and heartfelt letters about how she has changed lives .
‚Äú I wanted to kind of document this experience and the things that I 'm learning and express myself creatively , and along the way it turned into this thing where I 'm helping people , and I love helping people , ‚Äù Kluss said .
The climb to success with her blog did not come without a struggle to find balance , though . Kluss said she had to take steps back to realize that she could not accomplish everything all at once . Despite this , she found that her blog has been worth all the time and effort .
Lahney also had to find a balance between school and her business , she said . Lahney and her sister took something they enjoyed , nail string art , and converted it into a business that could be shared with others .
‚Äú We did it just because we love crafting together and we wanted to find something else to do . It was over the summer and my sister was just having fun , she just graduated from high school and she had a lot of time her hands , and so we made it happen when we started our little business of ‚Äò Sister String Art , ' and that 's where it kind of started taking off , ‚Äù Lahney said .
She said she decided it was time to move the activity from a hobby to a business when she realized that people were interested in it . The money they were making went from paying for supplies to turning a profit .
Lahney said when she fulfills requests , she breaks the project down to the exact size , color and design the customer wants all while ‚Äú making sure they got exactly what they were looking for at the price they [ are ] comfortable with . ‚Äù
These student businesses have been beneficial in terms of accountability , making money and more . Ugale , Kluss and Lahney believe there is potential for anyone to let their own work shine and become something bigger .
‚Äú I kept with it , and I think hard work and dedication just pays off , and even if you do n't see it paying off really fast , it can turn into something in the blink of an eye , ‚Äù Ugale said .

Religious extremism has started to spread into inland provincial areas from the Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region , according to China 's top religious affairs official , who urged the China Islamic Association to step up services for Muslim migrants and lead the fight against extremist thoughts .
Wang Zuo'an , head of the State Administration for Religious Affairs , said that the infiltration of extremist thoughts into the eastern and central areas deserves close attention .
‚Äú ( The Islamic clergy ) should stand in the front line in the fight to curb religious extremism ‚Ä¶ and put in time and energy to convert the mindset of those people influenced by extremist thoughts , ‚Äù he said .
Wang recommended that the Association use the internet to make clear the nature of the harm of extremism to Muslims . It should also encourage the use of popular Islamic readings to satisfy the religious demand of their congregations , and refute misinterpretation of the Quran , he said .
‚Äú We should let Muslims know the boundaries between legal and illegal religious activities , to enable them to say no to illegal activities , ‚Äù he said .
China has seen a growing trend of Muslims migrating from the West to eastern and central areas for the purposes of business , employment and study . Religious services and clergy training are sometimes limited in these eastern and central regions .

General Motors is currently involved in discussions that could result in the sale of its Opel and Vauxhall brands , the automaker said today .
French automaker PSA Group could potentially acquire GM 's European automotive operations . PSA Group currently runs the Peugeot , Citro√´n , and DS car brands .
A press statement confirmed the two automakers are discussing a sale , but it also said ‚Äú there can be no assurance that an agreement will be reached. ‚Äù If the plan does go through , PSA could move ahead of Renault and become the second largest automaker in Europe in terms of market share . By securing 16.3 percent of the market , PSA would slot just behind Volkswagen .
GM and PSA have been working together for many years . In 2012 , the automakers agreed to share platforms and co-produce certain vehicles . GM also bought a stake in PSA but sold it not long after the announcement .
Opel and Vauxhall have n't achieved a net profit since 1999 , and about six years ago , GM began revamping its European operations . Part of that restructuring involved closing down Opel factories in Belgium and Germany and taking Chevrolet off the market in Europe . Even after these changes , GM Europe failed to turn a profit last year .
This is n't the first time GM has attempted to get rid of its European car business . GM was about to sell the operations to Canadian parts maker Magna before backing out in 2009 .
Oddly enough , PSA Group said last year that it wants to return to the U.S. market within 10 years in an effort to become a more global company .

‚Äò The City is dead ! Long live Innovation ! ' are the words we hoped would be cried out around campus last week as The Beaver added another twig to its nest of revitalisation . However , as of yet , we have still not received a submission to the newly rebranded section . We , at Innovation , began to rack our brains for schemes to popularise the rookie segment . It was concluded that an introductory piece would be useful in laying out our plans for this year and onwards . In addition , we hope to persuade you , our highly literate student population , to turn your attention to matters of a more unconventional nature and upload them to Innovation .
Firstly , I believe a bit of background to the direction change would not go amiss . The City was originally set up to document events relating to business , finance and economics . Whilst this may have excited some , economics is not known as the dismal science without reason . The connotations of data crunching and number analysing were a deterrent for many and left The City with a narrow readership and even narrower writing base . We sought a change to broaden the appeal for potential writers and readers .
With the evolution into Innovation we are attempting to open a wide umbrella that encompasses new and quirky ideas beyond the limited scope of business and finance . We are opening the floor to any new research , discovery or technology that may have developed or be developing . For inspiration , we encourage you to look to the Science and Technology or the Entrepreneurship sections of The Economist and Financial Times respectively . Articles published here tend to veer towards the realms of Physics , Archaeology , Sociology and Anthropology to name but a few . This is what we are aiming for : a couple of pages each week that will satisfy your interests and desires reaching beyond 32 Lincolns Inn Fields .
That is not to say we are discouraging articles on exchange rates and derivatives . As a student paper , our aim is to act as a platform for LSE students to voice their opinions . If you get your kicks out of writing a weekly column critiquing China 's trade policy , you should have the opportunity to express your ideas . For those more mathematically inclined , it would be useful to view The City as a subset of Innovation : a cog in a larger machine .
Size does n't matter .
To engage you , the reader , we are encouraging submission of short form articles . Ideally , the section would contain two 200-300-word long articles , a 400-word article and a larger 500-600-word article . Once again , we advise you look to The Economist . In the latter sections you can find articles of only two to three paragraphs in length . Our hope is that the shorter form will drive readership as less time has to be devoted to a lengthy piece when you might be eating lunch instead .
With more readers and more writers , we will be able to be more creative with Innovation . We are currently trialling a two-week special . This issue has been dedicated to ‚Äò small ' innovation ( I urge you to read Tom Sheriff 's article on nano-technology ) whilst next week we 'll turn to ‚Äò large ' innovation . Groundbreaking stuff . Yet , if the content comes , we will be able to branch out to more pivotal areas and turn the two pages before sport into the weekly highlight .
This is the aim . Part of The City 's failure was that , even if you were a finance enthusiast , why would you turn to The Beaver rather than the FT ? With shorter , quirkier articles we hope to push the boat in the direction of content that you would not receive from your mainstream papers . Write about something that interests you and it will most likely interest others . Above all , remember that rather than you being there for the paper , we are there for you .
Ebrahim Toure has never been charged with a crime but has been at the Central East Correctional Centre in Lindsay , Ont. , for four years on immigration detention . ( Anne-Marie Jackson / Toronto Star file photo )
Emboldened by a recent Superior Court decision strongly condemning Canada 's practice of indefinite immigration detention , lawyers representing a West African man who has spent nearly four-and-a-half years in maximum-security jail waiting to be deported will demand his release Thursday at a hearing in Etobicoke . ‚Äú His ongoing detention is unconstitutional because it 's both arbitrary and indefinite , ‚Äù said Jared Will , an immigration lawyer who recently took up the case of Ebrahim Toure , a 46-year-old failed refugee claimant who is not charged with a crime but has been in jail since February 2013 . ‚Äú They say they 're detaining him for removal but they have no means of removing him . There 's no end point to his detention and it 's disconnected from its purpose. ‚Äù Toure , who was profiled earlier this year as part of a Star investigation into immigration detention , is the longest-serving immigration detainee in detention . He says he was born in The Gambia and raised partly in Guinea . But he ca n't prove his citizenship to either country so neither will take him back . Canada 's border police accuse him of not co-operating with his deportation , but he insists he is willing to be deported and has given them all the information he has . ‚Äú Their position is that it 's his lack of co-operation that is the impediment to the removal , ‚Äù said Will , who recently won the release of another immigration detainee who had been locked up for more than seven years . ‚Äú But they have nothing concrete to demonstrate that there 's anything that he can actually do to facilitate the deportation . ‚Äù
Article Continued Below
Toure 's case is just the latest to draw scrutiny upon Canada 's immigration detention system , which is facing a potential overhaul in light of recent court challenges . Will was the lead lawyer in those cases as well . Last month he argued in Federal Court that the entire immigration detention regime violates the Charter of Rights and Freedoms and should be struck down or dramatically altered . A decision is expected sometime this summer . In April he successfully persuaded Superior Court Justice Ian Nordheimer to order the immediate release of Kashif Ali , who had spent more than seven years in immigration detention . In a firm reprimand to Canada 's border police , Nordheimer called Ali 's situation ‚Äú unacceptable ‚Äù and said the government could not justify jailing someone indefinitely ‚Äî even in cases where they were not co-operating with their removal .
Will is now threatening to take the government to court if they do n't release Toure . About a month ago he sent a letter to Canadian border officials asking them to outline how Toure has been unco-operative and what specifically they want from him to assist in his removal . ‚Äú We 've asked for a list of exactly the steps that they want him to take and they have failed to provide that list , ‚Äù Will said . ‚Äú If they ca n't say what it is that they need from him it 's difficult , I think , to maintain the allegation that he 's the one who is not co-operating. ‚Äù Meanwhile , the Liberal government is in the midst of a review of immigration detention , having recently wrapped up a public consultation on potential policy changes . Last summer they announced a $ 138-million investment to upgrade immigration detention facilities and expand alternatives to detention . Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale has said his government is aiming to reduce the number of long-term detentions and the use of maximum-security jails . But changes may soon be forced on the Liberals . Among those being considered by the Federal Court is a six-month limit on immigration detention ‚Äî something that is already in place in some countries . Currently , Canada 's border police can indefinitely detain non-citizens they consider a danger to the public , are unlikely to appear for their deportation , or if their identity is in doubt . The average length of detention is about three weeks , but some cases drag on for months or years . Although immigration detainees have not been criminally charged , many of them end up in maximum-security jails and are treated the same as sentenced criminals or those awaiting trial . Toure 's case on Thursday will be heard by the quasi-judicial Immigration and Refugee Board , an arm's-length administrative tribunal that reviews detentions every 30 days . Lawyers often do not attend the detention reviews because they find them procedurally unfair and stacked in the government 's favour . Will , for instance , does not typically attend detention reviews because he has found them to be little more than a rubber stamp . But given the Superior Court 's decision in Ali 's case , he is hoping he can convince the board member that , just as it was with Ali , there is no reasonable prospect that Toure will be deported , so his continued detention is indefinite and disconnected from its purpose , which is a violation of the charter . Immigration officials have refused to discuss Toure 's case with the Star . In his detention reviews they have pointed to his past use of aliases to assail his credibility and suggested his current identity is also false . Toure is not considered a danger to the public and he has never been charged with a crime in Canada . He did plead guilty in 2004 to selling counterfeit CDs and DVDs in Atlanta , Ga. , where he was living under a false identity at the time . That conviction , for which he served no jail time , is the basis for the government 's decision to place Toure in a maximum-security jail rather than the less-restrictive Immigration Holding Centre .
Former President George H.W . Bush has been hospitalized in Houston with an infection , just after attending the funeral of his wife , Barbara , a spokesman said .

Jim McGrath said Monday on Twitter that the 93-year-old Bush is `` responding to treatments and appears to be recovering . '' He was admitted Sunday morning to Houston Methodist Hospital after an infection spread to his blood , McGrath said .
Barbara Bush was laid to rest Saturday in a ceremony attended by her husband and former presidents Bill Clinton , Barack Obama , George W. Bush and their wives , along with current first lady Melania Trump . Mrs. Bush was 92 , and she and her husband had been married 73 years ‚Äî the longest presidential marriage in U.S. history .
George H.W . Bush uses a wheelchair and an electric scooter for mobility after developing a form of Parkinson 's disease , and he has needed hospital treatment several times in recent years for respiratory problems .
He attended the funeral wearing a pair of knitted socks decorated in blue , red and yellow books ‚Äî a tribute to his late wife 's work promoting literacy .
McGrath would n't elaborate Monday night on the specifics of Bush 's condition , saying additional updates would be issued `` as events warrant . '' But he said the 41st president was eager to get well so he can get to his summer home in Kennebunkport , Maine .
`` He 's the most goal-oriented person on this planet , '' McGrath said .
Former Florida Gov . Jeb Bush indicated during his eulogy Saturday that his father had been hospitalized recently at the same time Barbara Bush was in the hospital for the last time . Those hospitalizations were not publicly disclosed at the time .
`` I think Dad got sick on purpose so that he could be with her , '' Jeb Bush said .
First lady Melania Trump tweeted Monday evening that she was sending `` healing thoughts of strength , along with prayers , for President George HW Bush tonight . ''
On Friday , during the public viewing of Barbara Bush 's casket , George H.W . Bush offered his hand to many of the around 2,500 people who walked through the church to pay their respects .
A year ago this month , he spent two weeks in the hospital for treatment of pneumonia and chronic bronchitis , a constant irritation of the lining of tubes that carry air to one 's lungs . His doctors said chronic bronchitis is a condition more prevalent with age and can aggravate the symptoms of pneumonia .
The elder Bush was hospitalized for 16 days in January 2017 for pneumonia . During that hospital stay , which included time in intensive care , doctors inserted a breathing tube and connected him to a ventilator .
He also was hospitalized in 2015 in Maine after falling at home and breaking a bone in his neck , and in December 2014 for about a week for shortness of breath . He spent Christmas 2012 in intensive care for a bronchitis-related cough and other issues .
People in their 90s with Parkinson 's disease are often at higher risk of pneumonia and other infections because their swallowing process can be compromised , said Dr. David Reuben , professor of geriatric medicine at the UCLA medical school in Los Angeles .
`` And the stress of losing a loved one can weaken the immune system , '' he said .
Bacterial infections are treated with antibiotics , he said , while viral infections require other treatments . Infections that spread to the blood usually are not viral , however , he said .
The prognosis for such a case would depend on a number of factors , including heart rate , blood pressure and oxygenation , Reuben said .
`` The more of these parameters are abnormal , the more serious the case is , '' he said .
George Herbert Walker Bush served as president from 1989 to 1993 . Born June 12 , 1924 , in Milton , Massachusetts , Bush also served as a congressman , CIA director and Ronald Reagan 's vice president .

TOKYO ( Sputnik ) - Japan highly appreciates the new US Nuclear Posture Review ( NPR ) and intends to strengthen the deterrence capability of the Tokyo-Washington alliance , Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Kono said in a statement on Saturday .
`` Japan highly appreciates the latest NPR which clearly articulates the U.S. resolve to ensure the effectiveness of its deterrence and its commitment to providing extended deterrence to its allies including Japan , in light of the international security environment which has been rapidly worsened since the release of the previous 2010 NPR , in particular , by continued development of North Korea 's nuclear and missile programs , '' the statement said .
According to Kono , Japan shares with the United States the same recognition of `` such severe current security environment . ''
`` Japan will strengthen the deterrence of the Japan-U.S. Alliance by closely consulting on the extended deterrence , including nuclear deterrence , through the Japan-US Extended Deterrence Dialogue and other consultations , '' the minister added .
Kono also noted Japan 's readiness to closely cooperate with the United States in efforts toward the total elimination of nuclear , biological and chemical weapons and the strengthening of the non-proliferation regime .

Etah : Samajwadi Party president and Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav on Monday alleged that the BJP has `` copied '' his party 's poll 's manifesto and accused the Modi government of `` harassing '' people by demonetisation .
Speaking about the alliance with Congress , he said , `` Bicycle ( SP 's election symbol ) had been strengthened by the cooperation of hand ( Congress poll symbol ) . ''
Addressing election rallies in Etah and Jaithra town Yadav alleged that BJP has `` copied '' his party 's poll 's manifesto and asked , `` Where are the acche din ( good days ) and Rs 15 lakh in the bank account of people promised by BJP ahead of 2014 Assembly election . ''
`` People can see that we have done a lot of progress in every sphere in the last five years ... We started Samajwadi ambulance service . The dial 100 for emergency police service was introduced to curb crimes and provide safety to the people , '' Yadav said .
On the demonetisation move of the Modi government , he accused the Centre of harassing the common people .
`` Poor people were harassed by forcing them to stand in long queues at banks , while the rich people did not face any problem at all , '' the Samajwadi Party leader alleged .
West Antarctica 's vast ice sheet conceals what may be the largest volcanic region on earth , research has revealed .
The continent 's ice covers almost 100 newly discovered volcanoes , the largest of which is as tall as the Eiger in Switzerland , a study has found .
Geologists and ice experts say the range has many similarities to East Africa 's volcanic ridge , which is currently acknowledged to be the densest concentration of volcanoes in the world .
Researchers from the University of Edinburgh remotely surveyed the underside of the ice sheet for hidden peaks of basalt rock , like those of other volcanoes in the region whose tips push above the ice .
They analysed the shape of the land beneath the ice using measurements from ice-penetrating radar , and compared the findings with satellite and database records , as well as geological information from aerial surveys .
Scientists found 91 previously unknown volcanoes , ranging in height from 100 to 3850 metres . The peaks are concentrated in a region known as the West Antarctic Rift System , spanning 3,500 kilometres from Antarctica 's Ross Ice Shelf to the Antarctic Peninsula .
Results from the study , which is the first of its kind , will help scientists understand how volcanoes can influence long-term fluctuations in the ice sheet . They could also help improve understanding of how the continent has changed during past climates .
Their results do not indicate whether the volcanoes are active , but should inform ongoing research into seismic monitoring in the area . Volcanic activity may increase if Antarctica 's ice thins , which is likely in a warming climate , scientists say .
Previous studies and the concentration of volcanoes found in the region together suggest that activity may have occurred in previous warmer periods .
The study , published in the Geological Society Special Publications series , was proposed by a third-year undergraduate student at the University of Edinburgh .
Dr Robert Bingham , of the University of Edinburgh 's School of GeoSciences , said : ‚Äú It is fascinating to uncover an extensive range of volcanoes in this relatively unexplored continent . Better understanding of volcanic activity could shed light on their impact on Antarctica 's ice in the past , present and future , and on other rift systems around the world . ‚Äù
Max Van Wyk de Vries , a student at the University of Edinburgh 's School of GeoSciences , who conceived the study , said : ‚Äú Antarctica remains among the least studied areas of the globe , and as a young scientist I was excited to learn about something new and not well understood . After examining existing data on West Antarctica , I began discovering traces of volcanism . Naturally I looked into it further , which led to this discovery of almost 100 volcanoes under the ice sheet . ‚Äù
REUTERS : Sergio Busquets called on Barcelona to sign more players after the club 's 3-1 Spanish Super Cup defeat by Real Madrid on Sunday .
The defensive midfielder believes his team need to reinforce if they are to wrestle power back from their rivals Madrid , who won a Champions League and La Liga double last season .
Barcelona announced the signing of Paulinho on Monday but still have to replace Neymar , who joined Paris St Germain for a world record 222 million euros .
They have been linked with Liverpool 's Philippe Coutinho and Borussia Dortmund 's Ousmane Dembele , both of whom might have been helpful as Barcelona struggled to break down Madrid at Camp Nou in the first leg .
Barcelona have been frustrated in the transfer market this summer , not only losing one of their best players but unable to sign their reported top targets either .
`` We do n't need new signings because of the result , but because we always have to renew and try to improve , no matter what , '' Busquets told reporters .

`` There 's no need for any excuses , now we have to draw up conclusions and look forward .
`` We have the game at the Bernabeu on Wednesday . It 's almost mission impossible , it will be really difficult to turn it around but we will try . ''
Paulinho will not be available to play on Wednesday for the second leg , in which Barcelona faces an uphill struggle , needing to score at least three away goals to be in with a chance of winning the cup .
With Neymar gone , Gerard Deulofeu was picked to play on the left wing in the first leg but he did not impress , frequently on a different wavelength to his team-mates .
Coach Ernesto Valverde is confident Barcelona will add to their squad before the transfer window shuts , although he prefers to focus on his current squad instead of speaking about potential signings .
Valverde told a news conference on Sunday : `` We 're Bar√ßa and we want to have the best team .
`` Until the end of August , there 's time , although I 'd like to focus on those I already have here , despite losing . And despite the fact that in this period there will surely be changes in the team . ''

The European Commission said on Friday it had conducted inspections in some EU states over banks ' alleged anti-competitive practices in limiting rival financial firms from accessing information about their customers ' accounts .
BRUSSELS : The European Commission said on Friday it had conducted inspections in some EU states into banks ' alleged anti-competitive practices in limiting rival financial firms from gaining legitimate online access to their customers ' data .
The Commission said in a statement it had `` concerns '' that the companies involved `` may have engaged in anti-competitive practices in breach of EU antitrust rules '' . It did not name any company .
It said that banks could have prevented non-bank competitors from gaining online access to account information of their customers to provide financial services , in spite of having obtained prior authorisation from the customers .
The unannounced inspections were carried out on Oct. 3 , the commission said . Antitrust inspections are preliminary steps into suspected practices that may not result in formal accusations .
Financial technology , or `` fintech '' companies had complained of banks limiting their access to customers . Fintech firms provide payment , lending and other services .

LAHORE - The increasing popularity of online shopping ahead of Eid-ul-Fitr among Pakistanis has upset the traders of local markets .
With the advent of technology and internet people are exposed to a wide range of things , which are easily accessible as the whole world is just a click away .
The changing trend of shopping among the consumers is replacing the traditional way of shopping and slowing down the sales of giant shopping malls and local markets , including Saddar Bazaar , Ichhra Bazaar , Pace shopping centre , Model Town Bank Square Market and Liberty Market .
According to a survey conducted by The Nation on Wednesday in bazaars and markets , shopkeepers are selling all the stuff at comparatively higher prices as compared to last year .
On Facebook , different brands are offering Eid-ul-Fitr discounts from 20 percent to 40 percent to lure the potential customers who are always looking for these kinds of deals .
Daraz.pk is offering 20 percent discount on shoes , 40 percent discount on stylish jewellery and 70 percent on kids fashion and toys . The website strives to make sure that the best collections of designer clothing and fashion shoes are brought onto people 's computer screen .
The famous brands Kayseria , Khaadi , Sana Safinaz , Gul Ahmed and Amir Adnan have started selling their new collections like hot cakes on the internet . To establish e-commerce industry banks and telecommunication brands are offering amazing discounts on online Shopping Day for Eid and Ramazan . Thus online shopping has become an increasingly popular and much liked trend , which has gained a lot of momentum . If it continues to facilitate people like this , it might take over the retail stores .
Talking to The Nation , retailer Faisal Janjua , owner of a shop in Liberty Market , said this year they were floating special offers to attract buyers . ‚Äú I have done publicity of my products through my Facebook page . There is only a specific class , which comes to purchase clothes for Eid-ul-Fitr in Liberty and elsewhere in posh areas , while a large number of people is buying online due to special discount offers , ‚Äù he said .
‚Äú If we are selling unstitched embroidered lawn for Rs4,000 , they are selling the same product for Rs3,500 with free home delivery . We have increased the prices of all our stuff because this year there is no sale , ‚Äù he said .
Jawad Malik , resident of Samanabad , said he came to Ichhra market to purchase suits and shoes for his children but changed his mind after finding out that they were very expensive . ‚Äú There is no check on the shopkeepers . The price of a pair of standard shoes for children ranges between Rs600 to Rs800 which is higher than last year , ‚Äù he said .
Khaadi store manager Amir said that those who live near shopping malls prefer to buy on their own . ‚Äú In comparison , walk in sales as compared to last year have fallen . Mostly people are purchasing online and we are going out of stock this time , ‚Äù he said . Fashion designer Arsalan Iqbal was of the view that e-commerce was the future of clothing line . ‚Äú Awareness has improved so much that now it has surpassed retail store sales . ‚Äù
‚Äú If we compare the online sales with the average sales of one of our highest sales generating flagship outlet then yes , online business is going head to head , ‚Äù he said .
Fashion designer Erum Khan was of the view that her brand had specific lines catering to each segment and price point , fulfilling the design needs of each . ‚Äú Bridal wear is expensive that is the reason international buyers rather than local prefer purchasing bridal wear online . On Eid , embroidered lawn is more sold online because of the prices , ‚Äù she said .
Shopkeeper Babar Awan of Anarkali said that people were not coming to bazaars due to sweltering heat . ‚Äú Online shopping special offers do not worry us . Middle and lower middleclass people come here for shopping . They do n't come at day time ; they start coming after Iftar . Hopefully , the Eid rush will start in a couple of days , ‚Äù Babar said .

WARREN RUDA / THE CITIZENS ' VOICE FILE PennDOT spokesman Richard Kirkpatrick said a move to the former site of the Murray Complex on South Pennsylvania Avenue in Wilkes-Barre would allow the public to also use compressed natural gas .
WILKES-BARRE ‚Äî If the Luzerne County Transportation Authority moves to downtown Wilkes-Barre , it will mean the agency and the public can use natural gas for their vehicles .
Compressed natural gas , or CNG , is the fuel that will power Pennsylvania 's public transit agencies , including LCTA .
The Pennsylvania Department of Transportation is making the fuel a priority . In March 2016 , PennDOT chose Trillium CNG to design , build , finance and operate compressed natural gas fueling stations at 29 public transit agencies across the state .
At the time , plans included a way for the public to buy CNG at the County of Lackawanna Transit System station , but not at LCTA 's current station . The authority was scheduled to get a natural gas filling station for its vehicles this year , but that project was delayed while consultants looked for a new site .
The plans for a CNG fueling station did not drive the move , said PennDOT spokesman Richard Kirkpatrick , but a move to the former site of the Murray Complex on South Pennsylvania Avenue in Wilkes-Barre would allow the public to also use the resource .
‚Äú Wherever the agency decides to move , we will assist with installing the CNG station , ‚Äù he said .
The public fueling site would join six other planned CNG fueling sites that would offer the service to the public , including COLTS . Other transit systems that will have an option for the public include Beaver County , Erie , Indiana , Johnstown , New Castle and York .
The current LCTA headquarters in Kingston have so little space that it would have been difficult to add a filling station there , even if it only serviced LCTA buses , executive director Norm Gavlick said . The authority 's large buses currently use diesel fuel , and shared-ride vehicles use gasoline .
‚Äú That was part of the reason why PennDOT agreed to do a feasibility study for us ‚Äî to look at our whole operation and see what our options were , ‚Äù he said .
LCTA had been considering consolidating its operations in Kingston and its shared-ride program , which is based in Forty Forts , Gavlick said . A move closer to the James F. Conahan Intermodal Transportation Center in Wilkes-Barre will cut down the amount of time buses are in transit without carrying any passengers , he said . The increased space will also allow for more services .
LCTA already has two natural gas buses ordered , and they will arrive in 2018 or early 2019 . Some recently purchased shared-ride vehicles are CNG-convertible . They currently use gasoline , but can be converted to use CNG for about $ 3,000 per vehicle , Gavlick said . As the authority replaces vehicles in its fleet , it will replace them with vehicles that use natural gas .
Trains
The region 's possible return to passenger rail service is another reason the LCTA looked at the Murray Complex site , Gavlick said . The site is next to railroads that connect with the COLTS station in Scranton .
‚Äú Nobody expects passenger rail service to happen right away , but I think the fact that it 's being considered in a long-range planning to where it puts both counties in a position to make it happen is a good thing . And it just so happens that this Murray site sits on the spot that provides that , ‚Äù Gavlick said .
Wilkes-Barre and Scranton are both represented by U.S. Rep Matt Cartwright , D-Moosic , who has championed passenger rail and a renewal of service between the region and New York City .
Still , many entities would need to fund a return to passenger rail .
‚Äú Starting new service would require new federal , state and local funding , and that is not in place at the moment . Beyond that , we ca n't speculate , ‚Äù Kirkpatrick said .

NATURAL GAS
Like coal and oil , natural gas is a fossil fuel formed from the remains of plants and animals buried underground and exposed to pressure and heat during millions of years .
The fuel is used to power electricity production , heating and for other uses . Only a tiny amount goes toward vehicle fuel . In 2015 , less than one percent of the total amount of natural gas consumed in the country powered vehicles , according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration .
Pennsylvania is a major player in natural gas . The state has the second-largest proved natural gas reserves of U.S. states , second to Texas . Proved natural gas reserves are reserves that can be recovered under existing economic and operating conditions . New technology and price changes affects that number .
Helio Castroneves and Team Penske confirmed Wednesday the longtime Verizon IndyCar Series star is leaving open-wheel racing to join the organization 's new Acura Team Penske program that will begin competing in the IMSA WeatherTech SportsCar Championship in 2018 .
Castroneves will partner with previously-announced drivers Juan Pablo Montoya and Dane Cameron in racing one of two Acura ARX-05 Daytona Prototype International ( DPi ) entries next season . Acura Team Penske 's final fulltime and endurance drivers will be announced at a later date .
‚Äú I 've still got a lot more fuel to burn . Now I 'm going to be burning it in a sports car , ‚Äù Castroneves quipped during a teleconference with team-owner Roger Penske .
Castroneves officially will return to sport car competition , joining fellow-Penske drivers Montoya and Simon Pagenaud , at this weekend 's 20th Anniversary Motul Petit Le Mans at Road Atlanta driving an ORECA-07 . The team will make its competition debut with the new Acura prototype sports cars at IMSA 's 2018 season-opening Rolex 24 at Daytona in January at Daytona International Speedway .
Petit Le Mans is set for Saturday on the 2.54-mile/12-turn Road Atlanta layout in Braselton , Ga . The 10-hour event will run from 11 a.m. until 9 p.m. ( EDT ) .
In addition to his sports car duties , Castroneves will continue to compete for Team Penske in next May 's Indianapolis 500 as the popular Brazilian continues his pursuit to become a four-time winner of ‚Äú The Greatest Spectacle in Racing . ‚Äù
Castroneves will run the entire Month of May schedule at Indianapolis Motor Speedway , beginning with the INDYCAR Grand Prix on the facility 's 2.439-mile/14-turn road-course and the 102nd edition of the 500 on the 2.5-mile oval . Penske said Montoya , a two-time Indy 500 champion who ran the same one-off Indy program last May , is free to negotiate with another team for an Indy 500 ride in 2018 .
Castroneves finished second to Takuma Sato , then of Andretti Autosport , by 0.2011-seconds during the 101st edition of the Indy 500 on May 28 .
‚Äú Certainly for me along with Roger , I 'm excited about this new program , ‚Äù Castroneves said . ‚Äú When Roger and I sat down a year ago we talked about several things . I felt this program , with the family I have started at Team Penske‚Ä¶it 's my passion , it 's in my blood . It will continue my racing career . I 'm excited about this opportunity .
‚Äú For me as a kid , all I wanted to do is drive . That 's my goal and having the opportunity to be with an incredible organization and Roger , it means more than anything people can understand . For me it 's a no-brainer . ‚Äù
Citing sponsorship among other factors , Penske confirmed he will field a fulltime three-car program in the Verizon IndyCar Series in 2018 for reigning series champion Josef Newgarden , 2016 series champ Simon Pagenaud and 2014 series champ Will Power .
‚Äú Helio has been a valuable member of Team Penske for almost 20 years and we are looking forward to sharing more success together , ‚Äù Penske said . ‚Äú Competitors like Helio , Rick Mears and Mark Donohue are what have made Team Penske what it is today . This represents a new challenge for him and I know he 's excited about the opportunity . Having established winning drivers like Helio and Juan , teaming up with young and talented racers that know the series like Dane Cameron , will help give our new sports car program a solid foundation as we head into the 2018 season .
‚Äú As we manage our business , we always have a plan . I sat down with Helio at the beginning of 2016 and talked about his future and the future of his team and a potential sports car program and his availability . Until we had a firm contract with Honda we were unable to make a commitment . To me , this gives Helio a longer future in his racing career . He 's the ultimate team-player . ‚Äù
Castroneves will transition to the Penske sports car program after 18 successful seasons with the organization 's Verizon IndyCar Series team . Castroneves finished fourth in this year 's championship standings , marking the 14th time in his career that he has placed inside the top-five in the season-ending rankings . Over the course of his 20-year INDYCAR career , Castroneves has recorded 30 wins and 50 pole positions , including one win and three poles in 2017 .
Considered one of the all-time greats in INDYCAR history , Castroneves has earned more wins than any driver in the history of Team Penske 's championship open-wheel racing program . He has three victories in the Indianapolis 500 , including back-to-back wins in his first two starts in 2001 and 2002 . He last won at Indianapolis in 2009 and has come remarkably close to earning a record-tying fourth Indy 500 victory , finishing second twice over the last four seasons .
In addition to his INDYCAR success , Castroneves also has made five starts for Team Penske in sports car competition . He has produced two poles , three podium finishes and a class victory in the 2008 Petit Le Mans event .
‚Äú I 've been fortunate to achieve a lot of my personal goals with Team Penske over the years , ‚Äù said Castroneves , 42 , the longest-tenured driver in team history . ‚Äú Helping Roger , the team and everyone with Acura start this program and build it from the ground-up will be another big challenge and a great opportunity in my career . I 'm proud of everything we have accomplished together in INDYCAR and now I am focused on helping to develop the ARX-05 to try and win the 24 Hours of Daytona and the IMSA championship in 2018 with Acura .
‚Äú I 'm also excited to get a chance to race again for Team Penske at the Indianapolis 500 . That race is near and dear to my heart and trying to become the fourth four-time winner is something I really want to accomplish in my career . We 've come so close the last few years and with this team , I know we will have a great opportunity to try and make some history . ‚Äù
The Acura ARX-05 ( Acura Racing experimental , generation 5 ) is the latest in a line of endurance prototypes to be fielded by the company dating to 1991 , just five years after the 1986 launch of the Acura brand . Based upon the successful ORECA 07 chassis , the new ARX-05 prototype features Acura-specific bodywork and utilizes the race-proven , production-based Acura AR35TT twin-turbocharged 3.5-liter V6 engine .
Penke 's multi-year program will be administered by Honda Performance Development , the racing arm for both Acura Motorsports and Honda Racing in North America .
This Petit entry will give the team a chance to experience a full-race weekend prior to making its debut with the Acura ARX-05 program .
‚Äú We 've had this race on our radar for some time , but we wanted to wait until we were able to get our drivers some testing at Road Atlanta prior to committing , as it 's a very fast track and these cars are very different to drive from an Indy car , ‚Äù Team Penske President Tim Cindric said . ‚Äú Unfortunately , we confirmed this the hard way as we have had to totally rebuild our car after an incident during testing . ORECA have bent over backwards to be sure we receive everything we need as they understand the importance of this race as our team prepares for the debut of our Acura ARX-05s at the Daytona 24 .
‚Äú Juan has participated in the majority of our prototype tests since we announced him as one of our fulltime Acura drivers . We would also like to involve our other drivers in the program whenever possible . Helio and Simon have good experience in prototypes at Road Atlanta , so they seem like a natural fit to participate in the Petit for us . ‚Äù
In addition to his open-wheel experience , Pagenaud has a vast background in sports car competition . He earned 10 American Le Mans Series wins between 2009 and 2013 , including a class win in the 2010 Petit Le Mans while racing for Acura . Pagenaud also earned four wins while driving for Peugeot _ including two at Spa in Belgium and two at Silverstone in England _ and is a former pole-sitter for the 24 Hours of Le Mans .
‚Äú It 's a bit of a homecoming to get back into a prototype car , ‚Äù said Pagenaud , whose recent win at the Sonoma IndyCar Series finale led to a second-place finish in the championship behind Team Penske 's Newgarden . ‚Äú They are great cars to drive and to be paired with Juan and Helio in an endurance event is going to be a lot of fun . This is a chance for me to help Team Penske prepare for next year , while seeing what things we can learn and where we can improve right now . ‚Äù

The Prime Minister said that this sum is not inclusive of the scholarships to Cuba and to China and elsewhere .
Skerrit said further that supplementary appropriation valued at over $ 4 million dollars was also spent in this financial year .
‚Äú To all our students in the United States we may have spent by way of supplementary appropriation about 4.5 or so a million dollars to the United States to two schools , Grambling State University and Midwestern University , ‚Äù he said .
The Prime Minister stated that is a major investment in the United States economy .
Emmanuel Macron plans to award multi-year grants for several U.S.-based scientists to relocate to France , his office said on Monday on the eve of a climate summit hosted by the president to raise finances to counter global warming .
PARIS : Emmanuel Macron plans to award multi-year grants for several U.S.-based scientists to relocate to France , his office said on Monday on the eve of a climate summit hosted by the president to raise finances to counter global warming .
Macron unveiled the `` Make our Planet Great Again '' grants after President Donald Trump in June said he was pulling the United States out of an international accord to reduce greenhouse gas emissions that was brokered in Paris in 2015 .
Macron repeatedly tried to persuade the U.S. leader to reverse his decision . In a statement , the Elysee Palace said 13 of the initial 18 grants would be awarded to scientists based in the United States . Macron will make a detailed announcement later on Monday evening .
At Tuesday 's summit , Macron will urge wealthy nations to increase climate financing and urge investors to turn their backs on polluters in a bid to accelerate efforts to combat global warming .
French state-controlled utility EDF on Monday said it would invest 25 billion euros to develop 30 gigawatts of solar capacity in France between 2020 an 2035 . Daily Newspaper Les Echos quoted the chief executive of Engie , Isabelle Kocher , as saying her company would invest one billion euros to improve the energy efficiency of buildings .
Separately , nine European energy companies including EDF , Italy 's Enel , Spain 's Iberdrola and Britain 's SSE said they would include green bonds in their financing policies .

Developing nations say that the rich are not on track with a broader commitment in the Paris accord for wealthy economies to provide US $ 100 billion ( ¬£74.9 billion ) a year by 2020 - from public and private sources alike - to help developing countries switch from fossil fuels to greener energy sources and adapt to the effects of climate change .
Oxfam estimated that there was only between US $ 4 - US $ 8 billion available for adaptation and that recent estimates showed the cost of helping to emerge nations deal with rising sea levels , droughts , flooding and other effects of global warming could add up to US $ 140 to 300 billion per year by 2030 .
`` Right now , the world 's poorest people are getting only a tiny fraction of the help they desperately need to survive , '' Oxfam said in a statement .
`` This year 's barrage of climate disasters showed that poor communities are often completely unprepared to deal with extreme weather . ''

After three hours of protesting , student protesters in Mumbai called off their rail roko agitation on Tuesday on the Central Line after the government assured them that their demands will be met .
A protester also said that the government had promised a discussion on this issue within two days .
A flash agitation by job-seekers over issues pertaining to railway recruitment had culminated in a rail-blockade , police caning and retaliatory stone-throwing . This led to a virtual paralysis of the Central Railway ( CR ) suburban train services in Mumbai on Tuesday .
For nearly three hours , the services were severely disrupted as the protestors squatted and laid on the railway tracks between Matunga and Dadar on the CR .
The agitation led to a cascading effect even on the Western Railway with all trains running packed to capacity .
More than 4.5 million commuters were affected for the second consecutive day following a strike called on Monday by drivers of cab aggregators and app-based taxis that disrupted in Mumbaikars ' schedules .
Attempting to restore normalcy , the local police resorted to a mild lathi charge to disperse the protestors . Some retaliated by pelting stones at the police .
At least five persons and a couple of police personnel were injured in the fracas even as top police and railway officials rushed to the site to control the situation .
The protests were carried out by activists of the India Act Apprentice Association ( AAAAA ) . It demanded scrapping of the 20 percent quota for direct recruitment and jobs for local candidates in all states who have cleared the India Railway Act Apprentice Exams .
They claimed they had taken up their demands right upto the Railway Minister Piyush Goyal who met them but there was no progress in the matter .
Shiv Sena MP from Mumbai Rahul Shewale met top CR officials to resolve the situation and later said that the railways would hire over 12,400 candidates who have cleared their apprenticeship exams .
A CR spokesperson earlier said that there was no provision of giving job to apprentices as per the Apprentice Act who are only trained for a specific period to hone their skills and gain experience .
`` However , the Ministry of Railways has taken a decision and reserved 20 per cent of the seats filled through direct recruitment . The notification is already issued with the last date of submitting application on 31 March . Apprentices can apply against this notification and Special Examination will shortly be held for apprentices who have done training in Railway Workshops under the Apprentices Act , '' the spokesperson said .
Meanwhile , the BEST had deployed extra buses to ferry commuters to and fro from various points like Dadar , Matunga , Kurla , Sion and other stations .
The protests threw out of gear the entire suburban and long distance railway schedules in Mumbai , Thane , Palghar , Raigad , Pune with commuters stranded for hours .
The opposition Congress and Nationalist Congress Party demanded a discussion on the issue in the Maharashtra Legislature on a priority basis .

ISLAMABAD : Despite extensive drilling by oil and gas E & P companies that resulted in over 90 new discoveries in just three years , the much-talked about IP , TAPI and LNG projects are considered the thirst-quenching streams for the energy starved nation .
Now with the concerted efforts of the present government , the decades old projects-Iran-Pakistan ( IP ) , Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-India ( TAPI ) gas pipelines and import of Liquefied Natural Gas ( LNG ) ‚Äì are almost in practical phase . Last year has already seen LNG 's import , while work on TAPI began in December , 2015 .
Similarly , the IP project will hopefully commence this year after amendment in the gas sale-purchase agreement with Iran .
Critics believe it or not , there is light at the end of the tunnel as setting sun of 2017 will see end to this crippling legacy of the previous years when energy shortages started to hit the country slowly and steadily .
In Pakistan , the gas supply-demand gap has reached 4 Billion Cubic Feet per Day ( BCFD ) as total gas demand of the country is 8 BCFD against total supply of 4 BCFD . Needless to say , in winter , the demand rapidly increases .
‚Äú The country has no option other than to import gas whether it is LNG or through IP and TAPI pipeline projects as its existing reserves are depleting and there is no major find since long , ‚Äù Secretary Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Resources said while addressing a seminar titled ‚Äú Transparency in public sector : An appraisal . ‚Äù
The present government , he said , was eyeing on imported gas besides accelerating local oil and gas exploration and production ( E & P ) activities to meet the ever-growing energy needs in the country .
Commenting on IP project , official sources in the Ministry revealed that the government was in the process of negotiating amendments in the Gas Sale Purchase Agreement ( GSPA ) with Iran for early implementation of the much-delayed project , which was conceived in mid-1950s .
‚Äú A draft amendment has been shared with Iran , and it has agreed to negotiate on it along with some other amendments in the GSPA , following which construction work on the pipeline is expected to commence soon in collaboration with China , ‚Äù the sources aware of the project updates said .
Sharing details of the project , the sources said Inter-Governmental Framework Declaration was signed between the two countries on May 24 , 2009 , while GSPA had been agreed on June 2009 .
Subsequently , Pakistan issued sovereign guarantee on May 28 , 2010 . The project consultant was appointed on April 11 , 2011 , while the design , feasibility , route survey and other formalities of the project were completed on September 8 , 2012 .
The 56-inch diameter pipeline will start from South Pars gas field in Iran and end at Nawabshah , covering a distance of around 1,931 km with 1,150 km portion in Iran and 781 km in Pakistan . The 750 mmcfd gas flow in the IP pipeline is projected to help generate around 4 , 000 MW electricity ALSO , along with creating job opportunities in backward areas of Balochistan and Sindh , the sources said .
Commenting on TAPI project , the sources said Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif along with other regional leaders performed the groundbreaking of the Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-India ( TAPI ) gas pipeline project in Turkmenistan in December last .
The groundbreaking ceremony took place near the city of Mary in the southeastern part of the central Asian country , close to the giant Galkynysh gas field which is meant to provide gas for the 1,814-kilometre ( 1,127-mile ) link .
The $ 10 billion pipeline , from Turkmenistan via Herat , Kandhar , Chaman , Quetta and Dera Gazi Khan to Multan and onwards to India , is expected to be operational by 2019 .
A state-owned company of Turkmenistan is the consortium for the TAPI and overseeing coordination in the construction , financing , ownership and operation of the project .
As per the agreement , it was prerequisite for Pakistan , India and Afghanistan to have five per cent shares each in the project . Turkmengaz , leader of the consortium , would have 51 per cent shares , with the rest marked for partner countries It is pertinent to mention here that Pakistan is already working on laying a 42-inch diameter 700-kilometer gas pipeline from Gwadar to Nawabshah , and a 1122-kilometer north-south ( Karchi-Lahore ) gas pipeline that can be used for supply the both regassified LNG and imported gas under IP and TAPI .
On LNG import , the official sources said this year Pakistan signed a 15 year agreement with Qatar to import up to 3.75 million tonnes of LNG a year , which was being highly appreciated by the business community as the previous governments had been reluctant to take any practical step in this regard .
After arrival of LNG , industries , gas-based power units , CNG sector , fertilizer plants and especially domestic consumers started receiving uninterrupted supply , which is not less than of any miracle by any mean .
A LNG-terminal is already operational at the Port Qasim , while two more each at Gwadar and Karachi are also being set up on priority basis to handle increased cargoes of the imported commodity for onward injection in the transmission network of gas companies ‚Äì Sui Northern Gas Pipeline Limited and Sui Southern Gas Company Limited .
With the present government firmly resolved and making all-out efforts to bring these projects to maximum fruition , the sources expressed high hopes that gas shortfall problem would be solved to maximum extent within remaining period of the government .
Among the countless myths perpetuated about abortion , it 's supposed link to mental illness has been amongst the most detrimental . Tackling these rumors , and any other false information being spread , helps make discussions about abortion and mental illness safer . And recently , a new study confirmed that having an abortion does not lead to depression .
The study , published in JAMA Psychiatry , is the work of Dr. Julia R. Steinberg , from the University of Maryland School of Public Health , and colleagues . According to EurekAlert , researchers analyzed data on Danish women born between 1980 to 1994 ; at the end of the study , that amounted to nearly 400,000 women . A press release for the study published by EurekAlert outlined that the information on these women included abortions , childbirths , and antidepressant prescriptions as recorded by the Danish national Registries .
It was the first study that looked at the risk of antidepressant use around an abortion as proxy for depression , according to the press release via EurekAlert . And the conclusion ? Researchers found that the risk of antidepressant use did not change from the year before to the year after an abortion . Additionally , the risk of antidepressant use decreased as more time after the abortion collapsed .
Given the stigma surrounding mental illnesses like depression , medications , and abortion , this study is incredibly important in helping people have access to medical care operating based on facts instead of rumors . And it could n't have come at a better time .

On May 25 , Ireland 's Eighth Amendment was voted to repeal by a wide margin . As reported by the BBC , voters were 66.4 percent in favor of the repeal to 33.6 percent opposed . The Eighth Amendment had been added to the country 's laws in 1983 , according to The Independent . During that time , The Independent noted , abortion was already illegal under the Offences against the Person Act of 1861 . However , anti-abortion activists in 1983 feared that this could be changed and lobbied for a referendum . The result was the Eighth Amendment , which prohibited women from aborting pregnancies unless their lives are at risk ‚Äî even in the cases of incest , rape , and fatal fetal abnormality , according to the BBC .
The 2010 case of Savita Halappanavar became a rallying cry for those voting YES . She was a 31-year-old Indian dentist who died from a septic miscarriage after being denied an abortion at Galway University Hospital , as reported by The Guardian .

In the fight to repeal the Eighth Amendment , YES campaigners had to handle not just rhetoric within Ireland , but young Americans who traveled just to stop the vote , as CNN reported . In the United States , myths that abortion leads to depression and suicide have been long present , and even The Irish Times ran an article debunking those myths . Although the Americans CNN followed ca n't be blamed for the presence of that myth in Ireland , it does need to be noted how American anti-abortion movements travel with misinformation .
In the United States , policies that restrict access to abortion have been justified by claims that abortion causes women psychological harm , as noted by EurekAlert . Anti-abortion campaigners in the United States call it PAS ( post abortion syndrome ) , a term coined by Dr. Vincent Rue , as Mother Jones reported . According to The Guardian , Rue testified before the U.S. Congress in 1981 that he observed post-traumatic stress syndrome in women who had undergone abortions . It was this testimony that gave way to the suggestion that abortion leads to depression and suicide .

`` Policies based on the notion that abortion harms women 's mental health are misinformed , '' Dr. Steinberg said , according to the press release via EurekAlert . `` Abortion is not causing depression . Our findings show that women were not more likely to suffer from depression after an abortion compared to beforehand . ''
The study found that , compared to women who did not have an abortion , those who did have one had a high risk of antidepressant use . But , according to the study 's press release , Dr. Steinberg stressed the higher risk was the same for both the year before and the year after . This indicated that the high risk is n't due to the abortion itself , but a result of other factors like preexisting mental health conditions and any other adverse factor .
Currently , the Guttmacher Institute reports that at least eight states mandate women considering an abortion receive information emphasizing the purported negative psychological effects . The Guttmacher Institute 's 2017 policy and trend map noted three states enacted new abortion counseling requirements . In Iowa , for example , women must seek counseling and wait 72 hours between the counseling session and the procedure .
Given the long reached of anti-abortion myths created in America , such as Rue 's claim , and the rate at which reproductive health is put into risk under Trump 's administration , this study could prove potentially life-saving for many women .

Although cats can be confusing creatures , there is apparently method to their madness . Many feline quirks can in fact be explained , so instead of shaking our heads at their oddball behavior , we should spend time understanding what they 're trying to communicate . Luckily , help is at hand in the form of this list . Read it and you 'll reach a deeper awareness of what your moggies are trying to tell you .
10 . Headbutting
Rather than instigating a brawl , when cats perform headbutts they do so with the best of intentions . There is even science behind their actions : the animals are transferring their smell onto you and leaving their feline fragrance on your forehead ‚Äì or whichever body part they are rubbing against ! Interestingly , there 's actually a name for this rather odd phenomenon . It 's called bunting .

On the other hand , cats are notoriously needy , and this tactic could simply be a handy way of getting your full and undivided attention . Another possibility is that they are trying to telepathically communicate with us , but we 're just too slow to have cottoned on just yet .

You might think that a pickpocket skilled enough to steal 100 cellphones , pictured above , would also be savvy enough to know that at least the iPhones in that haul carry a means to foil his caper .
Then again , you might be giving the crook too much credit .
From a story on the website of a Boston television station :
A New York man was arrested at the Coachella music festival in Southern California after he was found with more than 100 stolen cellphones , according to Indio police . During the concert festival on Friday , several people noticed their phones were missing and immediately activated the `` Find My Phone '' feature on their mobile devices . Some of the victims followed Reinaldo De Jesus Henao , 36 , through the venue , and he was quickly detained by security officers at the event , police said .
‚Äú Find My iPhone ‚Äù is no cutting edge feature , of course , and this is by no means the first time it has foiled a criminal enterprise .

Croatia 's hopes of qualifying for the World Cup were dented after conceding a 90th-minute equaliser in a 1-1 home draw with Finland in Group I on Friday .
RIJEKA , CROATIA : Croatia 's hopes of qualifying for the World Cup were dented after conceding a 90th-minute equaliser in a 1-1 home draw with Finland in Group I on Friday .
The result left the Croatians second on 17 points , two behind leaders Iceland who moved above them with a 3-0 win in Turkey .
Third-placed Ukraine also have 17 points but an inferior goal difference after a 2-0 win at bottom team Kosovo . Their clash with Croatia in Kiev on Monday is likely to decide who clinches the runners-up spot .
Both teams can still win the group only in the unlikely event that Iceland , aiming for their second successive major tournament after reaching the Euro 2016 quarter-finals , slip up at home against Kosovo .
Late substitute Pyry Soiri celebrated his international debut for Finland with a fine finish which silenced the home crowd , who then jeered the Croatian players off the pitch after a tepid performance .
The 23-year-old 's volley from eight metres cancelled out Mario Mandzukic 's 57th-minute opener after the home side missed a string of chances in the first half .

The best opportunity fell to Croatian centre back Domagoj Vida whose header was cleared off the line by Rasmus Schueller , after left back Josip Pivaric and winger Ivan Perisic also came close .
Captain Luka Modric , making his 100th international appearance , fired inches over the bar from 20 metres in the second half before the Finns threatened with Juhani Ojala 's header forcing an acrobatic save from goalkeeper Danijel Subasic .
Mandzukic scrambled the ball in from point blank range soon afterwards , with Pivaric 's cross diverted into his path by Finnish defender Niklas Moisander .
The Croatians sat back in the closing stages and having seen Joel Pohjanpalo 's fizzing low shot blocked by Vida , they were stunned at the death by Soiri who took advantage of static defending and blasted his volley past Subasic .

A white elephant gift exchange is a holiday tradition where a group of friends , family members or coworkers exchange useless and wacky gifts during a holiday party .
You can either play by Secret Santa rules or each person draws a number to determine who goes first . The person who draws number one chooses a gift and opens it for everyone to see . Each person after that can either steal an already opened gift from someone before them or he/she can choose an unopened gift .
If a gift is stolen from someone , that person gets to pick another unopened gift . This process continues until the last person has gone . A gift can only be stolen three times so the fourth person to steal it gets to keep it .
Generally this type of holiday exchange is for entertainment so you do not have to spend a lot of money on the gift and the funnier or weirder , the better ! Here are 30 ideas for your white elephant gift exchange this year :

BEIJING : China accused the United States of disrespecting Latin America after U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson warned countries in the region against excessive reliance on economic ties with China .
Tillerson , in a speech ahead of a visit to Mexico , Argentina , Peru , Colombia and Jamaica , said China was getting a foothold in Latin America , using economic statecraft to pull the region into its orbit .
In a statement released late on Friday responding to Tillerson , China 's Foreign Ministry said cooperation between China and Latin America is based on common interests and mutual needs .
`` What the United States said is entirely against the truth and displayed disrespect to the vast number of Latin American countries , '' the ministry said .
Cooperation between China and Latin American countries is based on equality , reciprocity , openness and inclusiveness , it added .
`` China is a major international buyer of Latin American bulk commodities , and imports more and more agricultural and high value-added products from the region , '' the ministry said .

China 's investment in and financial cooperation with Latin American countries are in full accordance with commercial rules and local laws and regulations , it added .
`` The development of China-Latin America ties does not target or reject any third party , nor does it affect the interests of third parties in Latin America , '' the ministry said .
`` We hope that relevant countries abandon outdated concepts of zero-sum games and look at the development of China-Latin America relations in an open and inclusive manner . ''
Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi visited Chile last month for a summit with Latin American and Caribbean countries , where he invited them to join China 's massive Belt and Road infrastructure programme .
Separately , the U.S. Treasury 's top economic diplomat , David Malpass , on Friday accused China of enabling poor governance in Venezuela by propping up the socialist government of President Nicolas Maduro through murky oil-for-loan investments .

The Greens take on Derby in the reverse fixture at Heslam Park this weekend , after last weekend 's game at Nuneaton was called off .
Scunthorpe bet Derby 27-24 back in October and since then have only lost one game , climbing to sixth in the Midlands Premier table and sit only six points off third-placed Newport .
That last game against Derby saw Scunthorpe race into a 20-0 lead , before Derby came back to lead 24-20 but the Greens edged home courtesy of a last minute try .
‚Äú It was a really strong performance for 60 minutes but Derby showed they are a quality side , ‚Äù Robinson told the Telegraph .
David Haig has not looking back since moving to Scunthorpe RUFC
‚Äú That game was the start of the momentum we have . It is a good game to remember and we need to put on a similar sort of performance .
‚Äú Derby 's results seem to have dropped off but they have had a tough run of fixtures through January and they have been on the wrong end of those results .
‚Äú But come Saturday they will be up for it because it is a local derby .
‚Äú They are a quality side , are very strong upfront and scored good tries so it will be tough .
‚Äú We just need to prepare properly , get the processes right and show we can challenge anybody particularly at home . ‚Äù
The postponement last week means Scunthorpe now have two games in hand over second-placed Peterborough who face Newport this weekend .
That postponed game against Nuneaton has been re-arranged for February 24 , meaning the Greens will have three away games on the trot , beginning next weekend at Longton .
‚Äú It will be nice to be at home again before the away run starts and we will look to get another W on the board , ‚Äù Robinson said .
poll loading How will Scunthorpe RUFC get on at home to Derby ? 0+ VOTES SO FAR Win Draw Lose
‚Äú We just need to keep games going because the last thing we want is a fixture backlog . It means we have three away games in a row , which is not ideal but it is out of our control .
‚Äú We are a few points from third so it is good in that regard and we have got games in hand . ‚Äù
Although focusing on his own game , Robinson will no doubt have one eye on the Peterborough Newport game as it could have a big say in the promotion shake up come the end of the season .
He also sees the need to try and pick up a few more bonus points in the second half of the season , with all the teams around the Greens picking up more .
‚Äú Peterborough and Newport could go either way but we just need to look after ourselves , ‚Äù Robinson said . ‚Äú Other results are out of our control .
‚Äú If had to pick one to win , I hope Newport do , to bring Peterborough back closer to us but what will be .
‚Äú We are losing out a bit with bonus points so we need to try and pick up a few more to put pressure on the teams above but conditions at the moment are not conducive to free flowing rugby .
‚Äú A lot of the top teams still have to play each other so by the end of February we should have a clearer picture . ‚Äù

Authorities in Minnesota are now releasing the name of the Iowan who was killed in a crash in that state over the weekend .
The Minnesota State Patrol says a car failed to yield at a median crossing late Friday night and was hit by a semi along Highway 52 in Goodhue County .
The car was driven by 22-year-old Jacob Nelson of St. Ansgar , who was injured in the crash . His passenger , 22-year-old Cody Squier of St. Ansgar was killed .
The truck driver was n't hurt . Troopers say both of the Iowans were belted in and there 's no sign alcohol was a factor .
This statement was originally published on indexoncensorship.org on 22 November 2017 .
Governments have arsenals of weapons to censor information . The worst are well-known : detention , torture , extra-judicial ( and sometimes court-sanctioned ) killing , surveillance . Though governments also have access to less forceful but still insidious tools , such as website blocking and internet filtering , these aim to cut off the flow of information and advocacy at the source .
Another form of censorship gets limited attention , a kind of quiet repression : the travel ban . It 's the Trump travel ban in reverse , where governments prohibit exit rather than entry . They do so not merely to punish the banned but to deny the spread of information about the state of repression and corruption in their home countries .
In recent days I have heard from people around the world subject to such bans . Khadija Ismayilova , a journalist in Azerbaijan who has exposed high-level corruption , has suffered for years under fraudulent legal cases brought against her , including time in prison . The government now forbids her to travel . As she put it last year : `` Corrupt officials of Azerbaijan , predators of the press and human rights are still allowed in high-level forums in democracies and able to speak about values , which they destroy in their own - our own country . ''
Zunar , a well-known cartoonist who has long pilloried the leaders of Malaysia , has been subject to a travel ban since mid-2016 , while also facing sedition charges for the content of his sharply dissenting art . While awaiting his preposterous trial , which could leave him with years in prison , he has missed exhibitions , public forums , high-profile talks . As he told me , the ban directly undermines his ability to network , share ideas , and build financial support .
Ismayilova and Zunar are not alone . India has imposed a travel ban against the coordinator of a civil society coalition in Kashmir because of `` anti-India activities '' which , the government alleges , are meant to cause youth to resort to violent protest . Turkey has aggressively confiscated passports to target journalists , academics , civil servants , and school teachers . China has barred a women 's human rights defender from travelling outside even her town in Tibet .
Bahrain confiscated the passport of one activist who , upon her return from a Human Rights Council meeting in Geneva , was accused by officials of `` false statements '' about Bahrain . The United Arab Emirates has held Ahmed Mansoor , a leading human rights defender and blogger and familiar to those in the UN human rights system , incommunicado for nearly this entire year . The government banned him from travelling for years based on his advocacy for democratic reform .
Few governments , apart from Turkey perhaps , can compete with Egypt on this front . I asked Gamal Eid , subject to a travel ban by Egyptian authorities since February of 2016 , how it affects his life and work ? Eid , one of the leading human rights defenders in the Middle East and the founder of the Arab Network for Human Rights Information ( ANHRI ) , has seen his organisation 's website shut down , public libraries he founded ( with human rights award money ! ) forcibly closed , and his bank accounts frozen .
While Eid is recognised internationally for his commitment to human rights , the government accuses him of raising philanthropic funds for ANHRI `` to implement a foreign agenda aimed at inciting public opinion against State institutions and promoting allegations in international forums that freedoms are restricted by the country 's legislative system . '' He has been separated from his wife and daughter , who fled Egypt in the face of government threats . The ban forced him to close legal offices in Morocco and Tunisia , where he provided defence to journalists , and he lost his green card to work in the United States . He recognises that his situation does not involve the kind of torture or detention that characterises Egypt 's approach to opposition , but the ban has ruined his ability to make a living and to support human rights not just in Egypt but across the Arab world .
Eid is not alone in his country . He estimates that Egypt has placed approximately 500 of its nationals under a travel ban , about sixteen of whom are human rights activists . One of them is the prominent researcher and activist , Hossam Bahgat , founder of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights , who faces accusations similar to Eid 's .
Travel bans signal weakness , limited confidence in the power of a government 's arguments , perhaps even a public but quiet concession that , `` yes indeed , we repress truth in our country '' . While not nearly as painful as the physical weapons of censorship , they undermine global knowledge and debate . They exclude activists and journalists from the kind of training that makes their work more rigorous , accurate , and effective . They also interfere in a direct way with every person 's human right to `` leave any country , including one 's own , '' unless necessary for reasons such as national security or public order .
All governments that care about human rights should not allow the travel ban to continue to be the silent weapon of censorship - and not just for the sake of Khadija , Zunar , and Gamal , but for those who benefit from their critical voices and work .

PARIS : A superb Neymar free-kick helped Paris Saint-Germain to a 3-0 win at troubled Lille on Saturday ( Feb 3 ) as the Ligue 1 leaders began a decisive month as they mean to go on .
The world 's most expensive player netted the second goal at the Stade Pierre-Mauroy after Yuri Berchiche had opened the scoring just prior to half-time .
Giovani Lo Celso 's delightful chip secured the victory late on , with PSG now 11 points clear of Marseille at the top of the table .
PSG have won 12 of their last 13 games in all competitions , including four in a row since a 2-1 defeat at Lyon last month .
Their season-defining Champions League last-16 tie against Real Madrid is fast approaching , with the first leg to come in the Spanish capital on February 14 .
`` The best preparation for the match in Madrid is to be competitive in every match and work on the things that we can improve , '' said PSG coach Unai Emery .

He will hope to have the likes of Adrien Rabiot , Julian Draxler and Thiago Motta back fit for that game , while Kylian Mbappe will almost certainly start at the Santiago Bernabeu .
The teenage France forward was absent on Saturday due to suspension after being sent off in the 3-2 League Cup semi-final win at Rennes in midweek .
`` A lot of things can still happen . I can not say today who is going to play in Madrid , that is impossible . I just hope the best is still to come , '' added Emery , whose team have a French Cup tie at Sochaux to come on Tuesday .
DEBUCHY DEBUT GOAL
In Mbappe 's absence , Angel Di Maria again started alongside Neymar and Edinson Cavani in attack , but the Uruguayan was unable to add to his club record tally of 157 goals .
Spaniard Berchiche was handed a start ahead of Layvin Kurzawa at left-back and he broke the deadlock right on half-time , drilling home after a poor attempted clearance by Junior Alonso fell to him .
Lille is a club with serious off-field worries , concerns about their finances leading to them being handed a transfer embargo that prevented them from adding to their squad in January .
Sports daily L'Equipe even reported on Saturday that the club had been told they face being relegated at the end of the season if their financial situation does not hugely improve , regardless of their final league position .
Christophe Galtier 's side had looked set to go into the break on level terms before Berchiche struck , and they were upset that Cavani was not flagged offside in the build-up to that goal .
Just 13 minutes remained when Neymar effectively ended the game as a contest , finding the top-left corner with a free-kick from right on the edge of the area .
It was the Brazilian 's 18th goal in 17 Ligue 1 appearances , with seven of those coming in his last three outings .
Lo Celso arguably topped Neymar 's effort with his chip over Lille goalkeeper Mike Maignan , as the young Argentine again stood in well for the veteran Motta . The assist had come from new signing Lassana Diarra , on as a substitute for his league debut .
Marseille claimed an extraordinary 6-3 win over bottom club Metz on Friday , with Florian Thauvin scoring a hat-trick .
Fourth-placed Monaco host Lyon , who are third , in a key game in the battle for Champions League places on Sunday .
Elsewhere on Saturday , Mathieu Debuchy scored on his debut for Saint-Etienne in their 2-0 win at Amiens .
France right-back Debuchy signed a deal until the end of the season in midweek after being allowed to leave Arsenal . He was also involved in the build-up to Remy Cabella 's goal that sealed the win .
Bordeaux made it two wins out of two under new coach Gustavo Poyet , beating Strasbourg 2-0 away .

I Have never hankered for Pad Thai , not since I started experimenting with my palate in the late 90s .

Their Pad Thai is unassuming , but just hands down appetizing .

Remember , this was two years ago , in the out-of-the-way Garden Bloc in IT Park . Going there is an adventure in itself .
‚Äú It seems only like it was yesterday when we set up on a tiny corner lot at the Garden Bloc with only a handful of vendors , ‚Äù says one of the organizers , Michael Karlo Lim .
‚Äú Sugbo Mercado opened on Sept. 26 , 2015 , with the goal of being the first and biggest year-round weekly food market in Cebu and as a venue for the best of the best of Cebu as well as budding new players in the local food industry in a collaborative environment . ‚Äù
Workers , celebrities , businessmen , politicians or even just the curious passersby can now experience and enjoy anything from soups and fresh greens to a delicious selection of eclectic rice , noodles and skewers , ‚Äú From our original regular two-day , Friday and Saturday operations , we extended to three days due to popular demand adding Thursdays .
Since June of this year , we added a fourth day , Sundays , to cater to more of family market . We still maintain the 5 p.m. to 1 a.m. operations throughout , ‚Äù Lim added .
As of 2016 , Sugbo Mercado was officially endorsed by the Department of Tourism-Central Visayasas Cebu 's ‚Äú First Weekend Food Market ‚Ä¶ promoting individual brand identity and presenting diverse culinary delights from the Philippines and other parts of the world while supporting micro food entrepreneurs by providing the perfect venue to enable these to reach and expand their market . ‚Äù
STEPPING OUT
Sugbo Mercado has indeed diversified and has now found new venues for the convenience of foodies as well as to those who just want to have their fill . It 's the first time a food market here in the city to open various branches outside its usual premises .
‚Äú In the third quarter of 2016 , we launched our first expansion at the nearby Cebu Business Park with the intent of exploring the lower half of the city as a three-month pop-up .
We extended our stay at that location with its relative success and later closed it in the second quarter of 2017 as the neighboring construction works no longer made it feasible to continue operating an open-air food market .
‚Äú Our second location , also intended as a pop-up over the last quarter of 2016 , opened at CityDi Mare on the South Road Properties to great reception by the South market .
The seaside location and silt substrate of the area later proved challenging for tented operations , and we have halted operations in consideration of conversion to a more permanent container van park operation .
A GASTRONOMIC FEAST
Proudly , nine of the pioneering vendors and a good number of others reaching a year 's mark are now known for their signature dishes and contribution to the market and the local food culture at large .
It has since tripled in number and size from when it first pitched its tents . And just like that , Sugbo Mercado is now on its second year .
For avid foodies and those looking for a cool place to hang out , Sugbo Mercado not only showcases local food start-ups , but also homegrown musical
talents , ‚Äú As part of our nightly entertainment lineup , we put out local bands , some careers of which have been launched by their exposure to the Sugbo Mercado crowd .
Assembling the weekend 's lineup now includes fielding and scheduling band auditionees that the group now jokes about branching into talent management .
Seasonal film showings , art festivals , and other performances enrich the dining experience . ‚Äù
WE 'LL DRINK TO THAT
The food market in its signature red and white table linens has indeed grown by leaps and bounds , announcing not only of its expansion but also of paving the way for local food business to a different level .
‚Äú We are excited to announce our intent to enter Mandaue City with weeklong operations and a themed setup in the burgeoning entertainment and lifestyle hub in the area .
Expansions to Mactan are also being explored . As to the specifics‚Ä¶ we 'll cross the bridge when we get there . In our position as a start-up incubator and with our thrust to encourage job creation versus job-seeking , we launched the Foodtrepreneur Challenge in the second quarter of 2017 .
‚Äú Of 20 applicants we narrowed down to six finalists which we first introduced to the public in a grand taste test returning two weeks later for the live selling segment of the competition over two weekends . In the interim , the contestants received mentorship from Sugbo Mercado management , Sugbo Mercado vendors and our event partner AICA Cebu .
‚Äú The competition is intended to simulate the real-world process of start-up food entrepreneurs at Sugbo Mercado where they were judged by the value created by the new product , attractiveness of the market opportunity , the competitive advantage , the operational viability , the capability of the vendor , the capital requirements and financial forecast , and the clarity and persuasiveness of the oral defense .
The very first Sugbo Mercado Foodtrepreneur received one-month free booth space at Sugbo Mercado , P20,000 in cash , a Certificate Culinary Short Course worth P30,000 from AICA Cebu .
The competition was also to invigorate the market with new concepts to add to its diversity , and two of our contestants‚Äîthe champion and the runner-up‚Äî maintain booths to date . The second installment of the competition will be launched on our anniversary celebration . ‚Äù
New Delhi : The Delhi government Wednesday introduced a new system for transfer and postings of bureaucrats , making Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal as the approving authority , hours after the Supreme Court verdict on its long-running fight with the L-G on administrative and other powers .
So far , the Lieutenant Governor has been the approving authority for transfers and postings of the IAS and DANICS ( Delhi , Andaman and Nicobar Islands Civil Services ) officers .
However , senior bureaucrats working with the Delhi government claimed that 'services matter ' still lies with the office of Lt Governor because Delhi is a Union Territory , and services matter does not fall under the concurrent and state lists .
A top officer , requesting anonymity , said the Appropriate Regular Bench of the Supreme Court will take a final decision on the service matters and other issues .
Another officer claimed that the apex court has not set aside the May 2015 notification of the Ministry of Home Affairs , according to which services matter lies with the L-G .
As per an order issued by Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia , Delhi Administrative Subordinate Services ( DASS ) Grade-I , II , principal secretary and private secretary will come under the Deputy CM , who will be responsible for their transfer and posting .
Minister-in-charge will have a say in transfer and posting of other officials such as stenos .
Addressing a press conference here , Sisodia said the central government and lieutenant governor had `` misinterpreted '' rules by adding services matter in `` reserved subjects '' and they should `` apologise '' for this .
Sisodia said the Delhi government does n't need to get its decision approved by the L-G .
In a landmark order , the Supreme Court on Wednesday clipped the powers of the L-G , saying he has no `` independent decision-making power '' and has to act on the aid and advice of the elected government .
The judgement by a five-judge constitution bench , headed by Chief Justice Dipak Misra , laid down broad parameters for the governance of the national capital , which has witnessed a bitter power tussle between the Centre and Delhi government since the Aam Aadmi Party government came to power in 2014 .
India 's entry into the Wassenaar Arrangement as its 42nd member last week on the heels of its joining the Missile Technology Control Regime ( MTCR ) in June 2016 , is doubtlessly a feather in the cap of Indian diplomacy and a recognition of our growing international clout .
The global Wassenaar Arrangement ( WA ) regulates transfer and access to conventional weapons and dual use technologies . India 's membership is expected to facilitate high technology tie-ups with Indian industry and ease access to high tech items for our defence and space programmes .
For China , which has been consistently stalling India 's bid to join the Nuclear Suppliers Group ( NSG ) on grounds that this country is not a signatory to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty ( NPT ) , and for Pakistan which has stakes in stalling India 's bid , this is a huge rebuff . Both are not part of the Wassenaar Arrangement and of the Australian Group on non-proliferation which India is hopeful of being admitted into next year .
While there is a possibility that China will further accentuate its opposition to India 's bid to join the NSG , irritated as it is by India 's entry into the Wassenaar Arrangement , there is also an outside chance that India may strike a deal with China in the long run to help it gain entry into the Wassenaar Arrangement in return for Beijing shedding its opposition to India 's entry into NSG . China has been unsuccessfully bidding to joining the Wassenaar Arrangement because of its strong history of proliferation which most nations fear and resent .
Joining NSG is , understandably , India 's ultimate goal on the nuclear stage and failure to do so would be hard on this country but membership of three of the four groups for nuclear supplies would doubtlessly strengthen India 's access to high tech items for our defence and space programmes . Since many countries are common to NSG and to Wassenaar Arrangement and the Australian group , India would be in a better position to push its case for membership of NSG with them to thwart Chinese designs at least in the long run .
As it stands , India 's impeccable non-proliferation record , despite this country not being a signatory to the NPT , gives it a distinct advantage . There is a global recognition of India 's responsible behaviour as a nuclear weapons state and its potential contribution to the maintenance of nuclear norms .
Consequently , it is not difficult for India to convince other countries of India 's mature sense of responsibility and to trade with them in high tech items . The membership of WA would create the grounds for realignment of India in the export control policy framework of fellow-members , including eligibility for certain licensing exemptions .
India 's membership to MTCR last year was a passport to acquiring vital equipment for its space programme and its ability to source high-end missile systems and technologies as well as surveillance drones . The Wassenaar membership gives India an important voice in shaping global response to regional and global security developments , advances in technology and market trends .
There are several reasons for India to be so keen on NSG membership . The dominant one is that NSG membership can allow India access to sustainable supply of nuclear fuel at competitive prices thereby making it possible to speed up implementation of stalled nuclear projects . At the same time , access to technologies can help India to fast forward its thorium use programme towards its civil nuclear energy production . Besides , India could also import reprocessing technologies , which are critical for a three stage nuclear programme .
There can be little doubt that NSG membership could fast forward signing of civil nuclear deals with Australia and Japan , both countries whose current regimes are well disposed towards India and which have major business stakes in opening up to India . What has been holding up progress with them is the rigid non-proliferation stands of these countries even though they are convinced of India 's peace credentials .
It goes without saying that membership of NSG could allow India to be a part of the decision making process regarding supply of nuclear technology . It can later put its foot forward with a demand to bring down nuclear stockpiles all over the world and in turn make its neighbourhood safe too .
While the chances of China coming round to a deal with India to soften its stand on admitting India into NSG in return for India help in Beijing finding acceptance in the WA are remote , no harm would be done if New Delhi pursues this course doggedly .
Simultaneously , India must pursue vigorously to convince member-states of Wassenaar Arrangement and of the Australian Group ( after India is admitted into that group ) to trade in high tech items with New Delhi in pursuit of its civil nuclear programme and to not discriminate against it with regard to nuclear fuel supplies .
If this country manages to fulfill its needs for which it is pursuing entry into NSG , who knows , someday its requirement to be admitted into NSG may cease to be as critical as it is today .

Properties and goods worth millions of naira went up in flames with no less than ten families displaced and shop owners recounting loses after a fire outbreak in the early hours of Saturday in Jikwoyi , FCT .
Eyewitnesses who spoke with LEADERSHIP Sunday said they noticed the fire in one of the shops while on their way from a vigil at about 3am on Saturday . They said while it was possible that the fire might have been caused by faulty wiring or sparks , a generator already loaded with fuel in one of the shops was believed to have further triggered the pace at which the fire raise down the buildings .
'' It was this shop that the fire started from '' said an eyewitness who preferred to stay anonymity . '' We saw it when we were coming from the church this morning and before you know it , there was an explosion . It was a generator and I believe there was fuel in it .
'' At this time people living inside the compound were not aware of what was happening till they were alerted by some security men but then it was almost late '' , he narrated .
Mr. Ufong Basey a victim of the incident
'' I was sleeping when I heard a knock at my gate and I was not ready to wake up then because it was too early but the knocking became serious and I heard people screaming fire ! , fire ! That was when I realised I was in danger .
'' The only I could do was to dress up horridly . I came out only to find out that things have gotten out of hand . I met people outside either trying to help or escape because we have only one entrance to the compound which is no more like a door .
With the nature of the fire I could not go in again to even pick my phone or my credentials . I have lost everything including my documents . The only thing I came out with are the clothes I am wearing now , he lamented .
'' When they called the fire service at Karu , there was no response from them till someone tried that of Karishi . When they came they did their best to put off the fire and prevented it from spreading to the next compound , but it was late for people like us '' , recount Mr Basey .
Another victim , Mrs Devin David said she could not believe she could lose all her valuables in twinkle of an eye .
I ca n't really recall clearly what happened . They brought our light late at night and some hours later , I started perceiving some burnt and I opened my kitchen in three different occasions to check where the smell was coming from but did n't see anything . I walk around and checked and did n't notice anything .
It at about 3am or there about that a good Samaritan , a security man started hitting gate shouting that we should come out but I told my husband not to go out because of security purpose . But the man insisted and started shouting that fire is coming .
That was how we all came out but then the flame was out of control . We could not go in again to take anything . We could not call fire service because we left our phones inside the house . I rushed to a man driving along the street and begged him to call the service , which he did but they did n't pick . At this time people started coming trying to help break some of the shops that were not affected then but they could only do little .
'' The building is so chocked because the shops are blocking the house from the outside and that really hindered those who help , said Mrs David who broke into tears saying she did n't come out with anything and now being harboured by a good Samaritan .
'' My credentials , my husbands ' and that of my brother have been eaten up by fire . My husband is dry cleaner and he came back home last night with people clothes and all is gone '' , she cried out .
Mr. M Joe , a hair stylist , who also own one of the affected shops said it was an unexpected disaster . He said it was sad that it is happening at this time of the year when people are just recovery from the recent economic shock . It is too early for the year . My shop has gone , so what ? He asked .
'' My neighbour who owned a fashion store close to mine lost millions of naira to the outbreak . Her industrial sewing machines and other valuables have all gone . I feel for her more than the way I am pained in the inside , said Mr Joe .
Mr. Andy Onekpe who escaped the sad incident said he and his wife and three children were almost victims but for the intervention of the Karishi fire service . They came late but they have saved more disaster than what happened here today .
You can see how the houses are arranged . They are so chocked that anything affecting one could easily penetrate to the other . My wife had a one week one week old baby and we were all in the bedroom when we heard the shout of fire . My apartment was almost affected but for the help of some neighbours till the arrival of fire service .
He said there is a need for a fire service station to be stationed in Jikwoyi . According Mr. Onekpe , `` Jikwoyi is a very populated place in the FCT and you should expect something like this because most areas here are slumped like . ''
REUTERS : Tottenham Hotspur will not give up on the Premier League title race midfielder Eric Dier has said , despite Saturday 's loss at Liverpool leaving them 10 points behind table-toppers Chelsea .
`` You never know in the Premier League , obviously Chelsea are doing very well and are in a good position but you can never say never , '' Dier told Sky Sports when asked if the third-placed north-London club 's title chase was over .
`` We 've always maintained we 're going to give everything in the competition , so you never know what can happen . It will be a very tough task . ''
Dier also felt it was important that young midfielder Dele Alli remained with the club , despite his 11 goals in 24 league appearances this season attracting interest from across Europe .
`` He 's still a very young boy , I think people need to remember that , '' Dier said . `` I think he 's at the perfect place because he 's got a support system around him and a manager and a group of players that will take care of him .
`` You have to worry about young players sometimes in certain places if they can cope with it and will they be looked after as a 20-year-old boy and not just an asset .
`` I think he 's very well looked after here and hopefully he will be for a long time . ''

Hitting back at Prime Minister Narendra Modi over his `` obsession '' with the Congress party , Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi claimed that the prime minister has been avoiding key issues since BJP 's `` vikaas yatra '' has been a flop .
Speaking at a rally in North Gujarat 's Banaskantha on Monday , The Indian Express quoted Rahul as saying , '' The Gujarat elections are going on and Modi speaks sometimes on Japan , Pakistan and Afghanistan . It 's the Gujarat elections , speak on Gujarat . ''
Rahul said that Modi is nervous about losing Gujarat and hence his speeches have been focusing partly on himself and partly on the Congress . `` Tell me one speech where he has spoken about vikaas in Gujarat , '' he quipped .
Targetting Modi over his `` Gujarat model '' , Rahul said that the economic model only helped a few big industrialists and not the common man . `` Modi took away land from the farmers and gave it to the Tatas for setting up the Nano factory . He promised jobs to everyone . But we see that no one got the job as well as the car , '' Rahul said .
In true filmy style , Rahul said , `` Modi has the government machinery , army , intelligence units , state governments , money from industrialists . Only Modi can be seen on TV . We do not have money but we have truth on our side . ''
Upping the ante against the prime minister , Rahul claimed that Modi helped 10 of the country 's biggest industrialists receive waivers worth Rs 1,30,000 crore , but ignored the plight of farmers .
`` Modi says that it is not his policy to waive off farmer loans . But I do not understand what crime has a farmer committed ? '' Rahul remarked .
Rahul reiterated his promise of farm loan waiver in Gujarat and vowed that waivers will be implemented within 10 days if Congress was voted to power in the state .
`` During the UPA era , you used to get correct prices for your crops . But not nowadays . We will ensure that you get correct prices for your produce , '' Rahul told the gathering .
Lamenting the alleged privatisation of education and medical services in Gujarat , the Congress vice-president claimed that people need to pay a hefty amount to admit their children to prestigious medical and engineering colleges .
`` Modi invested Rs 33,000 crore in Tata Nano but did not invest in the education sector . There are no doctors in government hospitals . if someone is ill then they need to give Rs 15 lakh or just die , '' Rahul said .
Calling Modi 's anti-corruption crusade a sham , Rahul claimed that the prime minister has stopped talking about corruption in his campaign trail .
`` He said that he will fight against corruption . But he snatched the money away from poor , '' Rahul said on demonetisation , and continued , '' Did you see any person wearing costly suits in the queue ? They were all converting their black money into white . ''
Rahul reminded Modi of his promise of crediting Rs 15 lakh in every account and added that even 15 paise has not been deposited in any account so far .
Targetting Modi over Goods and Services Tax ( GST ) , Rahul once again called it `` Gabbar Singh Tax '' and said : `` Due to Gabbar Singh Tax , a shopkeeper now gets only Rs 50 out of 100 . Half of his earned money is gone for GST . ''
Slamming Modi over his silence on the alleged financial irregularities in Amit Shah 's son Jay Shah 's company , Rahul claimed that the prime minister is frightened of the BJP president .
`` A company converts Rs 50,000 into Rs 80 crore in just few years but desh ka chowkidar is silent over it as Shah has the remote control of Gujarat , '' Rahul claimed .

A woman was reportedly found in one of the bedrooms in Drake 's house earlier this month .
One of the rapper 's entourage reportedly walked into his California mansion at 10:30pm local time on 3 April and found a 24-year-old woman , who has n't been named , wearing one of the One Dance singer 's hooded sweaters in one of the bedrooms , according to TMZ.com .
Police officers were called to the scene , where the woman claimed she had been allowed to enter the property , which was reportedly untrue . She also confessed to taking some of Drake 's drinks including Pepsi , Sprite and Fiji Water .
She was arrested and charged with felony burglary . Law enforcement sources have told TMZ there were no signs of forced entry , so it is unclear how she gained access to the property .
Drake was not in at the time of the incident .
This is n't the first time the 30-year-old has been a victim of a burglary . The tour bus he shared with Future was targeted while the duo were performing in Phoenix , Arizona in September .
A 21-year-old named Travion King was allegedly caught on surveillance footage and booked on a burglary charge . He reportedly took a briefcase full of jewellery , worth US $ 3 million , which was subsequently returned to the rappers .

The U.S. Attorney 's Office charged an Olyphant man for trying to persuade a 15-year-old girl to send him explicit photos .
Brian Lachance , 27 , was charged Monday with using a facility of interstate commerce ‚Äî the internet and a cellphone ‚Äî to attempt to entice a minor to engage in illegal sexual conduct , the United States Attorney 's Office for the Middle District of Pennsylvania announced Tuesday .

Where are Pok√©mon Go nests and how do you find them ? Here 's what you need to know !
`` Nests '' are spawn points where the same Pok√©mon pop up regular and in number . While spawn points can be anywhere , nests tend to be around Pok√©Stops or Gyms ‚Äî or several Pok√©Stops and Gyms within a park . Also , while things like water spawns tend to stay the same , month after month , nest migrate every two weeks . Here 's what you need to know !

Guides : Pok√©mon Go tips + tricks | Pok√©mon Go cheats
Why should you care about Pok√©mon nests ?
Nests are great for a number of reasons :
If you need a specific Pok√©mon to add to your Pok√©dex , going to a place that Pok√©mon nests vastly increases your odds of finding one ( or more ) . If you need candy from a specific Pok√©mon to evolve it or power it up , going to a nest gives you the chance to regularly catch them in greater quantities than random spawns would ever allow . If you 're trying to catch enough of a specific type of Pok√©mon to get your medals , be it Hiker or Fairytale Girl , nests can help you get closer to your goal ‚Äî and gold !
In other words , if you need Pok√©mon , finding a nest with the Pok√©mon you need is your best shot at getting them .
Are there any lists of all the spawn points and nests ?
Yup ! The Sliph Road maintains the most popular crowd-sourced nest atlas on the web .
If you consider crowdsourcing to be outside the bounds of fair play , you can find most of your local nests on your own simply by keeping track of any out-of-the-ordinary spawns . Most people consider it perfectly within the spirit of the game , simply more efficient than yelling about new nests from a variety of different places .
Any cluster spawns of 2 or more Pok√©mon of the same kind at the same time and any repeated spawns of the same Pok√©mon over a few days are indicators you 've found a nest . Just keep notes if you need to .
Are the Pok√©mon at spawn points and nests always the same ?
They 're the same for two weeks , then they change . Known and `` migrations '' , the changes occur on alternate Thursdays at 12 a.m. UTC . ( 4 p.m. PST / 7 p.m. EST or 5 p.m. PDT / 8 p.m. PDT ) . So , over the course of a few months , your Charmander nest might become Slowpoke , Charmander again , Diglett , Drowzee , Paras , then Growlithe , and so on .
Nest migrations are seemingly random , so if you get one you need , hit it as often as you can in those two weeks . Conversely , if a close by nest is useless , just wait a couple weeks and it 'll change .
Can more than one type of Pok√©mon spawn from the same point ?
Most nests only spawn one Pok√©mon type , or one interesting type along with some commons like Pidgey , Rattata , Sentrat , and Hoothoot .
That 's different from something like a water spawn , where Staryu , Slowpoke , Polywag , Psyduck , and Magikarp often all spawn all together .
Do all Pok√©mon have nests ?
Sadly , no Typically Pok√©mon that hatch from 10 KM eggs and those that are otherwise ultra rare do not spawn . Here are the Pok√©mon that currently DO NOT nest ( including thei baby or evolved forms ) :
Porygon
Chansey
Grimer
Hitmonlee
Hitmonchan
Lapras
Snorlax
Dratini
Mareep
Pineco
Heracross
Corsola
Mantine
Stantler
Hitmotop
Miltank
Larvitar
Dratini nests , please ? !
Dratini have n't nested since the very first weeks of the game . They can be found , albeit rarely , at water spawns .
If you have a local water spawn or several that gets frequent and multiple Magikarp , odds are you 'll get infrequent Dratini as well . That includes Pok√©Stops and cluster spawns near docks , piers , along rivers and lakes , etc .
Those are all are among the best places to walk and hope for Dratini .
Larvitar ?
Even more rare than Dratini at the moment . They can spawn anywhere though seem to mostly spawn around mountain biomes .
What about Magnamite ?
If you want that electric-type medal , you want Magnamite . You 're the best chance is electric biomes . Typically big power centers on big buildings like college or university campuses or sports complexes .
What about Snorlax , Dragonite , and Lapras ?
No nests , but they often appear in the same areas once a day or once a week . Each has their own environment , like Lapras near water or Dragonite in the mountains , but they also spawn in densely populated areas like cities . In my city , they seem to love the Olympic Stadium and Botanical Gardens downtown .
The best way to find out where the super-rare Pok√©mon hang out in your area is to make friends with other trainers , join local Pok√©mon Go Facebook groups , and get onto IM groups that ping everyone when they see that Snorlax spawn at the park .
Ditto ‚Äî a little help ?
Ditto can transform into other Pok√©mon and , so far , he 's only being encountered in the wild in his transformed state . That means you ca n't see Ditto on Nearby or Sightings , and you wo n't know if he 's spawned right next to you ‚Äî you 'll just see a Rattata , Pidgey , Magikarp , or Zubat with no visual or audible clue that they 're anything other than they seem ... until you catch them .
It 's only then you 'll be greeted with an `` Oh ? '' instead of a `` Gotcha ! '' and he 'll be revealed as Ditto .
See how to find and catch Ditto in Pok√©mon Go
Unown ‚Äî do you know ? !
Unown is one of the rarest and hardest to find Pok√©mon in Pok√©mon Go Gen 2 . Scratch that . Unown is one of TWENTY SIX of the rarest and hardest to find Pok√©mon in Pok√©mon Go ‚Äî period . That 's because it does n't spawn very often in most areas and , when it does , it can manifest as any one of the 26 forms , stylized after the letters of the alphabet , from A to Z . So , how do you catch 'em all ?
There 's no good answer at the moment , but we 're collecting everything we can find right here :
How to catch Unown in Pok√©mon Go
Can nests ever go away ?
It 's hard to tell . Some Pok√©Stops and Gyms do n't see to ever spawn at all . Other times nests just get taken over by incredibly common Pok√©mon for two weeks , like Caterpie or Krabby , and can seem like they went away .
The best thing to do is wait a couple weeks and check again .
Okay , once you find the nest you need , how do you catch the stubborn Pok√©mon that spawn there ?
Some Pok√©mon are considerably harder to catch than others . Sometimes it 's because they 've got a low catch rate or high flee rate . Sometimes it 's their level . Sometimes it 's because you 're not stacking all the bonuses you could be . And sometimes it 's because they 're so rare you freak out and forget how to maximize your chances .

They 're the essential bits of Christmas . Squeezing a fir tree into your living room . Eating an odd-looking bird . Welcoming an intruder who breaks in by coming down the chimney . Gazing at your fifth mince pie of the day and finally wondering what on Earth might be in it .
How many of us stop to think how Christmas all began ? Dennis Ellam did ... and here he explains where our festive traditions originate from .
And some of these facts might baffle you too ...
Father Christmas
Red robes , white beard , waist-slapping jollity and booming ho-ho-hos . He 's been around for ever , has n't he ?
Well , actually only since 1935 , when Haddon Sundblo , a Madison Avenue advertising man , created Santa Claus for a Coca-Cola campaign .
In previous lives he was thinner and paler , a character based on a 4th Century Asian bishop called Nicholas , who became the patron saint of children in most of Europe .
It was in Holland , where they called him Sinterklaas , that he earned his reputation for giving stuff away . A small pair of wooden shoes would be left by the fireplace and he would fill them with sweets . No question of trying to fit in a fashionable bodkin , let alone a Nintendo Wii .
Different countries still have their own variations on the theme , but that fat bloke in a red suit has pushed them all to the cultural margins .
What about Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer ? Debt-ridden shopworker Robert Mays invented him in 1947 as the hero of a bestselling book that made him a fortune . The song , written by an adman and a professional composer , came two years later . Who says Christmas is n't magical ?
Christmas crackers
The mastermind behind the Christmas cracker was a London sweetshop owner called Tom Smith . In 1847 , after spotting French bonbons wrapped in paper with a twist at each end , he started selling similar sweets with a `` love motto '' inside .
They were so popular as a Christmas novelty that Tom made them bigger and included a trinket . But the real flash of inspiration came when he poked the fire and a log exploded with a sharp CRACK ! That gave him the idea for a package that went off with a bang .
He launched his `` Bangs of Expectation '' with top-of-the range gifts such as jewellery , ivory carvings , perfume and miniature dolls . By 1900 he was selling 13 million a year .
But we ca n't blame Tom for the corny jokes and paper hats . They came later .

Mistletoe
Kissing under the mistletoe really took off a couple of centuries ago , but the plant 's racy reputation dates back much further than that .
In 300BC , the ancient Druids cut sprigs of the climber from the trunks of oak trees with a golden knife . They believed it had sexual powers and , boiled with the blood of a pair of sacrificial white bulls , that there was n't a finer aphrodisiac .
Its reputation lived on . By the 18th Century mistletoe balls , trimmed with ribbons , hung in the best hallways , where demure young ladies could stand waiting underneath , lips puckered .
The magic wears off , though . After each kiss , the gentleman should pull off a berry until there are none left , after which the rest of it should be ceremonially burned , otherwise it 's 12 months of bad luck and celibacy .

Turkey
Goose was the popular choice for Christmas dinners for generations . Middle-class families with lots of relatives might go for a boar 's head , while the seriously rich showed off with a swan .
The turkey did n't arrive until the 1600s , when merchants brought it back from America and marketed it as an exciting new festive taste - if you stuffed it with sage and onions and laced it with cranberries , that is . And ignored its natural dryness .
It really took off with the Victorians after Charles Dickens had Scrooge ordering a turkey in A Christmas Carol .
Nowadays a turkey is n't just for Christmas . It 's for sandwiches well past Twelfth Night . Followed by curries if you 're not careful .
Mince pies
Strictly speaking , it 's illegal to eat them on December 25 , so watch out .
Feasting at Christmas was banned by Oliver Cromwell in 1647 as `` lewd behaviour '' and that particular law has never been repealed .
Mincemeat at first meant what it said . There were bits of shredded meat among the dried fruits and spices .
The first recipes were probably brought back from the Middle East by the Crusaders .
But it was the Victorians who realised the concoction might taste better with the meaty bits left out .
Christmas pudding
A close relative of the mince pie . And just as challenging to the waistline .
It first appeared on the table in the 14th Century when it was more like a porridge made of beef and mutton , with currants , prunes , raisins and spices stirred in , plus a liberal lashing of wine , thickened with breadcrumbs and egg .
In the 1700s , minus the meat , it became a fruity end to the Christmas meal . And in the 1830s Eliza Acton - the Delia of her day - included a Christmas pudding recipe in her cookbook .
For a humble pud , it 's shrouded in superstition . You 're supposed to stir it in an east to west direction , representing the journey of the Three Wise Men .
A silver coin hidden inside brings good luck to whoever finds it . Unless , of course , he swallows it .

The tree
So who DID suggest cutting down a huge piece of shrubbery , dragging it into the house , covering it with lights , then sticking a model fairy on top ? Then leaving it there until it drops needles all over the floor .
Blame a German . The Romans had hung up the odd bit of green branch , but it was evangelist Martin Luther from Saxony who first decorated a whole fir tree .
That was in 1510 . The idea finally spread to Britain during Queen Victoria 's reign when her German-born husband Prince Albert had one sent over to remind him of his own childhood Christmases .
A drawing of the Royals and their children standing around their perfect tree appeared in the Illustrated London News in 1846 - and next year there was a rush to copy them .
Artificial trees were invented in the 1930s , by the Addis Company , who turned them out using spare machines in their , er , toilet-brush factory .

Cards
Not surprisingly , the custom of sending Christmas cards did n't start until there was a postal service to deliver them .
The first were sent in 1843 by Sir Henry Cole , boss of the Victoria and Albert Museum . He was far too busy to write letters so had an artist design 1,000 cards , illustrated with a festive family scene on the front and printed with the greeting , `` A Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year to You '' .
Horrified at being caught out , all his friends sent him one back the next year .
In 1880 cards had become so popular that the public were warned for the first time to post early for Christmas . A few of them might still be at the bottom of a mailsack somewhere ...
Tinsel
The first mass-produced Christmas decoration , it was made in Europe in the 1600s from sheets of silver alloy hammered until they were paper-thin and cut into strips .
The idea was to reflect the light from candles and fireplaces . Problem - after a few Christmases , the silver turned black . A cheaper , throwaway tinsel made from aluminium-based paper swept the festive market in the 1950s . Problem - it went up like a flash when it caught fire .
Now we have a modern tinsel made from PVC that wo n't discolour and wo n't burn . Problem - it 's toxic and ca n't be recycled . Over to you , Greenpeace ...
Why 25th of December ?
So Christmas is celebrated to remember the birth of Jesus Christ . But no one actually knows the real birthday of Jesus because no date is given in the Bible .
So why do we celebrate it on the 25th December ?
Despite lots arguments between early Christians as to when it should be celebrated , the first recorded date of Christmas being celebrated was on 25th December in 336 during the time of the Roman Emperor Constantine .
A few years later , Pope Julius I officially declared the birth of Jesus would be celebrated on the 25th each year onwards . However , there are many other traditions and theories as to why it 's celebrated on this particular date .
University of the Philippines ( UP ) remained perfect when it swept reigning champion De La Salle University ( DLSU ) in the University Athletic Association of the Philippines ( UAAP ) Season 79 women 's volleyball tournament Wednesday at the FilOil Flying V Center in San Juan .
The Lady Maroons crushed the Lady Spikers in straight sets , 25-22 , 25-21 , 25-19 .
Graduating outside hitter Nicole Tiamzon led the balanced offense as she delivered 16 attacks while Tots Carlos contributed 11 markers for the Lady Maroons , who tallied their third straight conquest .
Meanwhile , nobody from the Reigning champions scored in double figures with Kim Dy and Majoy Baron finishing with nine points apiece .
It was the first time in nine years for UP to win over La Salle . The last time the Lady Maroons prevailed was when the Lady Spikers forfeited their victory in the second round of the Season 70 eliminations due to Jacqueline Alarca 's eligibility issue .
Different story
This time , it was a completely different story .
UP assistant coach Rald Ricafort said collective team effort and preparation led then to the massive upset .
‚Äú Alam kasi ng girls ang capablity nila this year . Alam nila na sila ang medyo matured this season dahil sa composition nila . Nag-focus sila sa pagbasa ng plays ng La Salle. ‚Äù ‚Äú Alam kasi ng girls ang capablity nila this year . Alam nila na sila ang medyo matured this season dahil sa composition nila . Nag-focus sila sa pagbasa ng plays ng La Salle. ‚Äù ‚Äú Medyo naka-two days kami na nag-discuss. ‚Äù ‚Äú Yung discussion na parang lecture talaga . Talagang may mga PowerPoint pa silang pinresent . Every player may sariling assignment kung paano basahin ang La Salle . Alam namin na si Coach Boc ( Benson Bocboc ) ay magaling sa stats at sa pag-scout . Ang bawi namin ay collective effort . ‚Äù
He added that they are dead serious in putting an end to their 35-year title drought .
‚Äú Kailangan talaga ( manalo ) kasi alam namin na this year six teams ang pantay-pantay . So , malaking bagay na makapanalo , lalo na sa ganyang top teams . ‚Äù
But the Lady Maroons are not underestimating other teams , especially La Salle . They are just taking advantage of their maturity .
‚Äú Hindi naman sa kayang-kaya pero tingin namin sumakto lang sa line-ups . Pana-panahon , sila yung medyo maraming bata this year tapos kami naman ang medyo paangat . ‚Äù
Big win
Skipper Ayel Estra√±ero and the rest of the Lady Maroons were completely aware of how important the victory for UP .
‚Äú Siyempre it 's big knowing na sila ‚Äò yung champions last season . But for us , it 's something that makes us feel proud of what we put into training and the things we do outside the court . ‚Äù
Estra√±ero said their way to return the favor to the UP community for its continious support to their growing team .
‚Äú It makes us feel proud that we can bring this type of feeling to the UP community especially everyone who keeps supporting us . ‚Äù
The Lady Maroons , however , are taking it one game at a time .
They always remind themselves to trust the process presented by their coaches , especially head coach Jerry Yee .
‚Äú We 're continuously reminded of always trusting the process and focusing on each game and not really thinking about the endgame . ‚Äù
Do n't look now , but it seems these Lady Maroons are the team to beat .

SHANGHAI -
There 's a Trump toilet , a Trump condom , a Trump pacemaker and even a Trump International Hotel among hundreds of trademarks in China that do n't belong to Donald Trump . But after a decade of grinding battle in China 's courts , the president is expected to get an unlikely win on Tuesday : the rights to his own name .
Trump 's late victory in the fight to wrest back one sliver of his brand ‚Äî the trademark for building construction services ‚Äî could signal a shift in fortune for the U.S. president 's intellectual property in China . At stake are 49 pending trademark applications ‚Äî all made during his campaign ‚Äî and 77 marks already registered in his name , most of which will come up for renewal during his term . The case also raises the possibility that the president could claw back control of more than 225 Trump-related marks in China that do not belong to him .
To some , it also illustrates how Trump 's efforts to consolidate control over his brand could be used to extend or withhold favour , especially in a country like China where the courts and bureaucracy are influenced by the ruling Communist Party and by design reflect the leadership 's political imperatives .
Trump 's foreign trademarks have raised red flags with ethics lawyers across the political spectrum who say they present grave conflicts of interest and may violate the emoluments clause of the U.S. Constitution , which bars public servants from accepting anything of value from foreign governments unless explicitly approved by Congress .
‚Äú There can be no question that it is a terrible idea for Donald Trump to be accepting the registration of these valuable property rights from China while he 's a sitting president of the United States , ‚Äù said Norman Eisen , who served as chief White House ethics lawyer for President Barack Obama . ‚Äú It 's fair to conclude that this is an effort to influence Mr. Trump that is relatively inexpensive for the Chinese , potentially very valuable to him , but it could be very costly for the United States . ‚Äù
Richard Painter , chief White House ethics lawyer under President George W. Bush , called the situation ‚Äú highly improper. ‚Äù Since foreign governments know Trump cares deeply about his family 's business , Painter said , ‚Äú they will give him what he wants and they will expect stuff in return . ‚Äù
Eisen and Painter are involved in a lawsuit alleging that Trump 's foreign business ties violate the U.S. Constitution . Trump has dismissed the lawsuit as ‚Äú totally without merit . ‚Äù
Alan Garten , chief legal officer of The Trump Organization , said the Chinese trademarks were already in the works before the election , and the president has turned management of his company over to his children and a team of executives .
In an email , Garten wrote , ‚Äú The only mark we were seeking was one in the related class of construction which someone was improperly squatting on . ‚Äù
The precise value of the trademarks is a matter of debate , but Trump himself thought his brands in China were worth enough to defend them , according to a 2011 letter he wrote then-Commerce Secretary Gary Locke about a trademark dispute in Macau , an autonomous region of China .
‚Äú I spent hundreds of thousands of dollars in legal fees to secure my own name and globally recognized brand from Chinese individuals who seek to trade off my reputation , ‚Äù Trump wrote .
In May 2009 , he dispatched a team with 300 pounds of evidence to prove that Donald Trump was , in fact , famous . It did n't work . Trump railed against the courts as ‚Äú faithless , corrupt and tainted . ‚Äù
‚Äú The Trump name resonates throughout the entire world , ‚Äù Trump wrote . ‚Äú According to their ignorant council of judges , it appears the only two places in the world I am not well known are China and Macao , ‚Äù he added , using an alternative spelling .
That may be changing .
As president , Trump 's elevated profile in China will likely make it easier to protect his brand , said Zhou Dandan , a lawyer with Unitalen Attorneys at Law in Beijing , which has worked for Trump since 2006 . Trademark authorities will almost certainly reject new ‚Äú Trump ‚Äù applications from unrelated parties , she said , and may take back rights from existing ‚Äú Trump ‚Äù trademark holders .
That 's what happened in the case nearing completion this week .
Trump applied for rights to the Trump mark for construction services on Dec. 7 , 2006 , but a man named Dong Wei had filed a similar application about two weeks earlier . China works on a first-come-first-served basis for trademarks , and the Trademark Office rejected Trump 's application .
Trump appealed to the Trademark Review and Adjudication Board , then to the Beijing Intermediate People 's Court , and finally to the Beijing High People 's Court . He lost , lost and lost again .
Separately , he tried to invalidate Dong 's trademark , but failed , and failed again on appeal , according to Matthew Dresden , a China intellectual property attorney at Harris Bricken in Seattle , who has studied the case .
The last time courts ruled against Trump in the construction-services case was May 2015 , the month before he declared his candidacy .
Then Trump 's lawyers simply went back to the Trademark Review and Adjudication Board , which had already rejected their case , and again asked them to invalidate Dong 's trademark , Dresden said .
This time it worked . On Sept. 6 , 2016 , the Trademark Office published its invalidation of Dong 's trademark for construction services . Dong could not be reached for comment .
That decision cleared the way for Trump 's own claim to move ahead . Trump 's mark was published in China 's Trademark Gazette on Nov. 13 , less than a week after he won the presidential election . Interested parties have three months to object . If no one does , the trademark will be registered to Trump on Tuesday .
Why is Trump winning in China 's bureaucracy now , after years of failure ? China 's State Administration for Industry and Commerce and its foreign ministry did not reply to requests for comment .
Some lawyers point to a general hardening in China 's stance on trademark squatting . In January , China 's Supreme People 's Court released a legal interpretation stipulating that names of ‚Äú political , economic , cultural , religious , national and other public figures ‚Äù should not be trademarked . That notice came after a December ruling returned the Chinese version of Michael Jordan 's name from Qiaodan Sports Co. to the basketball star . In Mandarin , Qiaodan sounds like Jordan .
Others say politics almost certainly played a role . By 2016 , the nature of the dispute had changed . Chinese authorities were now ruling on a case that pitted a guy from Liaoning province against a man running for president of the United States .
‚Äú It would be hard to imagine that the judges , the Trademark Office and/or the Trademark Review and Adjudication Board were acting without some kind of guidance , ‚Äù said Dan Plane , a director at Simone IP Services , a Hong Kong intellectual property consultancy .
He added that the outcome of future cases could depend on Trump 's relationship with Beijing .
‚Äú If there 's a clear decision made by an angry Chinese government to stop giving broad protection to the Trump name in China , Trump 's ability to defend or enforce his name could be quite limited , ‚Äù Plane said .
Meanwhile , the makers of Trump-branded luxury toilets at Shenzhen Trump Industrial Co. face a potent new potential adversary . They say they will defend their brand , even if it means taking on the U.S. president .
Co-founder Zhong Jiye said his Trump toilet , which dates to 2002 , has nothing to do with President Trump . The Chinese name brings together ideas of innovation and popularity , he explained . And in English , the ‚Äú U ‚Äù makes a nice toilet-seat shape logo .
Trump toilets for the home can do pregnancy tests , while models for public use have disposable seat covers for improved hygiene . The company says sales were up more than 50 per cent last year and an international expansion is in the works ‚Äî perhaps under a different brand now that Trump is president .
People use Trump toilets some 100 million times a year , Zhong said .
Among them , he added , are customers at Zhongnanhai , the official residence of Chinese President Xi Jinping .

Remodeling ‚Äò nightmare ' for some customers of Bonita Springs Floor Covering
One month after a WINK News Call for Action investigation exposes remodeling nightmares , more customers come forward complaining about the same company .
More Customers Complain
Since our story on Bonita Springs Floor Covering aired , five more people came forward to complain about the company and one more person filed a lawsuit .
‚Äú I would n't recommend them ( Bonita Springs Floor Covering ) to anybody and if anybody asks us , do n't go near them , ‚Äù Tom Campbell said after hiring the company to remodel his kitchen .
Campbell said there were months when he thought the renovation project would never end . It took almost a year for the company to finish . Campbell is one of 20 people who filed complaints with our Call for Action office , the Better Business Bureau or the Department of Business and Professional Regulation against Bonita Springs Floor Covering and its president , Chris Pascale .
Why ca n't anything be done ?
‚Äú Under Florida law if you take money with the intent not to perform or under false pretenses and that would be fraud to induce someone into a contract by falsely representing , ‚Äù explained attorney Kevin Jursinki .
But proving fraud versus bad business practices is difficult . A lot of times , ‚Äú ‚Ä¶At best thats a breach of contract , ‚Äù said Jursinki .
However , if you are acting as a general contractor and you are hiring subcontractors to do the work , you need a license through the DBPR . When we checked , Chris Pascale does not have a license and has gotten in trouble with the state for doing work that required one .
‚Äú If you 're not a general contractor you ca n't subcontract and supervise work being done by other licensed contractors or subcontractors , ‚Äù explaiend Jursinki .
Conducting work that needs a license is illegal . As for why Pascale is n't behind bars , Jursinki said it may be because no one has filed a criminal complaint against him . We checked with the Lee County Sheriff 's Office for any complaint and they have not gotten back to WINK .

A company promoting a plan for the United States and Russia to jointly build nuclear reactors in the Middle East denied in a letter made public on Monday that its director received an Inauguration Day text message from incoming national security adviser Michael Flynn saying the project was `` good to go . ''
WASHINGTON : A company promoting a plan for the United States and Russia to jointly build nuclear reactors in the Middle East denied in a letter made public on Monday that its director received an Inauguration Day text message from incoming national security adviser Michael Flynn saying the project was `` good to go . ''
Citing a confidential informant , the top Democrat on the House of Representatives ' Oversight and Government Reform Committee last week said Flynn and Alex Copson , managing director of ACU Strategic Partners , communicated during President Donald Trump 's inaugural address about the project , which would have required lifting U.S. sanctions on Moscow .
Thomas Cochran , a business partner of Copson , wrote in a letter to the lawmaker , Representative Elijah Cummings , that the informant 's allegations are `` patently false and unfounded . ''
Reuters was unable to identify the confidential informant or independently confirm the informant 's information that was provided by Cummings .
Copson has not responded to numerous requests for comment in recent months .
Cochran attached to the letter records for Copson 's cell phone which , he said , show that he exchanged three text messages on Inauguration Day , Jan. 20 , none of them with Flynn .

`` Since Mr. Copson did not receive a text message from General Flynn during the Inauguration , other allegations of the 'whistleblower ' are equally false and unfounded , '' wrote Cochran , who is ACU Strategic Partners ' senior scientist . Flynn is a retired Army general .
Reuters and other news organizations have reported that Flynn continued to promote a version of the nuclear project after he began work at the White House .
As part of his investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russians during the 2016 U.S. election campaign , special counsel Robert Mueller is looking at whether Flynn or other Trump aides tried to influence U.S. policy to improve relations with Russia .
Proponents of the reactors project argued it would provide nuclear energy in the Middle East without the threat of weapons proliferation , improve U.S.-Russia relations and revive the U.S. nuclear industry .
Flynn served just 24 days as Trump 's national security adviser before being fired for misleading Vice President Michael Pence about whether he discussed U.S. sanctions with Russia 's ambassador to Washington .
He pleaded guilty on Dec. 1 to lying to the FBI about his Russia contacts .
Reuters reported that day that documents it had reviewed showed that ACU Strategic Partners bragged after Trump 's Nov. 8 , 2016 , election that it had Flynn 's backing .
Cummings wrote back to Copson on Monday , requesting that he participate in a transcribed interview `` so that our staff attorneys could ask you questions about your relationship and communications with General Flynn . ''
`` It remains unclear why your colleague sent this letter rather than you , '' he wrote .
Cummings ' office released Cochran 's letter but not the attached phone records .

DHAKA - Bangladesh fast bowler Mustafizur Rahman on Tuesday withdrew from next month 's Twenty20 series against Afghanistan in India because of an injured foot .
Mustafizur complained of pain after joining the national training camp last week , at the end of the Indian Premier League ( IPL ) in which he played for Mumbai Indians . `` Subsequent tests have revealed a crack on his left big toe which will sideline him for a few weeks , '' said a Bangladesh Cricket Board ( BCB ) statement .
`` It takes around three to four weeks to recover from such injuries and therefore he ca n't play against Afghanistan , '' BCB senior physician Debashis Chowdhury said in the statement .
Mustafizur is expected to start rehabilitation in two weeks , the doctor added . Afghanistan will host Bangladesh for the first T20 series between the two countries in the Indian city of Dehradun from June 3 to 7 .
Afghanistan will be preparing for their first-ever Test , against India in Bangalore from June 14 . Afghanistan are ranked eighth in Twenty20 internationals , two places ahead of Bangladesh who left for India on Tuesday .

Ellis ( left ) and Elliott Thornton-Kimmitt
Detective Inspector Andrew Naismith of West Yorkshire Police , told Wakefield Coroner 's Court today ( Mon Dec 11 ) that emergency services received a call just before 10pm on Saturday November 25 to a report of a road traffic collision on Stonegate Road .
Det Insp Naismith said the incident involved a Renault Clio , which had been reported stolen from outside the Wilkinson store at The Arndale shopping centre in Headingley .
The officer said the Clio was the only car involved in the collision .
Det Insp Naismith told the hearing that three `` juvenile fatalities '' were taken to Leeds General Infirmary .
Darnell Harte
The officer said the two adults who died were found on the pavement .
Senior Coroner David Hinchliff said provisional reports from post mortems revealed multiple injuries as the cause of death for all five people .
Mr Hinchliff was told there would be no need for further post mortem examinations and he issued burial and cremation certificates , which mean the families will be able to proceed with funeral arrangements .
The Thornton-Kimmitt brothers were from the Tinshill Mount in Tinshill , Leeds ; Darnell Harte was from Miles Hill Street in the Potternewton area , Mr Armour was from Ebor Place , Hyde Park , and Mr Meerun was from St Mary 's Close , Potternewton ..
Robert Meerun
Mr Hinchliff adjourned the inquest to a date to be fixed .
A 15-year-old boy has been charged with causing all five deaths by dangerous driving and is due to appear at Leeds Crown Court on Wednesday . ( Dec 13 )
I was talking with Jeff Atkinson , president of the Honda Indy Toronto , and I said it seems that every year , the first time anybody hears anything about the race is on the morning mid-week when they learn Lake Shore Blvd . W. is closed to traffic . How fast can you say crippling traffic jam on the Gardiner ? Every year , it seems , and this will happen next Wednesday night , July 11 , just in time for the Thursday-morning rush hour , it comes as a big surprise to many people that the road is closed for this car race that has only been happening in July since 1986 . Atkinson agreed this had been the case in the past but that this year is different . The Honda Indy has been doing a lot of promoting , he said , and many more advertisers and sponsors have come on board and more people have been purchasing tickets . ‚Äú We 're looking forward to a good year and a good race , ‚Äù he said .
Article Continued Below
Atkinson says that he and some pals first attended the race in 2001 and got in by purchasing general admission tickets . ‚Äú We had so much fun that the next year , we bought gold tickets , ‚Äù he said . And then he got a job with the company , Savoree Green Racing Promotions , and look what 's happened to him since . Not only is he in charge of the Toronto race , he 's vice-president , marketing , for races in St. Petersburg , Fla. , and Portland , Ore. , as well as all the public events at the Mid-Ohio Sports Car Course , south of Columbus . But that general-admission ticket experience left a lasting impression , because back when he was a spectator , there were n't a lot of places to watch the race .
‚Äú I vowed to fix that , ‚Äù he said . ‚Äú So a few years ago , we introduced the Pinty 's Pub and Grill for GA ticket-holders down on the outside of turn 1 , ‚Äù he said , ‚Äú and that has proved to be very popular . This year , the Miller Lite deck will be opened at turn 4 . It will be a great place to watch the race for general-admission ticket holders. ‚Äù Atkinson said the key to making sure nobody wakes up in the future to be surprised that the Lake Shore road is closed is to make sure first-time attendees leave happy . ‚Äú We 've done a good job with ticket packages and loyalty programs , ‚Äù he said . ‚Äú We just have to make sure that we continue to develop first-time festival-goers . Once they come down to Exhibition Place , they are going to be pleasantly surprised , not just with the entertainment on the race track but all the things you can see and do away from the race track . ‚Äú So many people , once they get introduced to motorsport , they become a fan for life . Think back to the first time you went to a race . It 's a special moment. ‚Äù nmcdonald @ thestar.ca
After an opening two days in which seeds perished in the hot Wimbledon sunshine there was some respite on Wednesday as several favoured players eased into the third round .
LONDON : After an opening two days in which seeds perished in the hot Wimbledon sunshine there was some respite on Wednesday as several favoured players eased into the third round .
An unprecedented 11 men 's seeds and 10 on the women 's side , including four of the top eight , failed to make it past the first round at the England Club .

With the number of seeds set to drop from 32 back to 16 at Grand Slams from next year the rate of attrition will slow .
American Madison Keys , the 10th seed , made sure she was not amongst the casualties when she beat Thailand 's Luksika Kumkhum 6-4 6-3 on Wednesday and there were also wins for ninth seed Venus Williams and number seven Karolina Pliskova .
While the loss of former champions Petra Kvitova and Maria Sharapova on Tuesday , not to mention Keys 's friend Sloane Stephens the day before , surprised many , Keys said it just proved the high level of the field .
`` I think it just shows the depth of women 's tennis right now , '' the 23-year-old told Reuters .

`` I think at the beginning of a tournament , you 'd never know who 's going to win . There are no 100 percent winners anymore . I think every single match is competitive . ''
While 23-times Grand Slam champion Serena Williams remains the benchmark for women 's tennis , the scramble to take advantage of her maternity leave backed up the Keys argument .
After the 36-year-old American won the 2017 Australian Open , five different players won the next five women 's majors .
`` There 's just an abundance of talent but it 's very unpredictable at the top , '' three-time Wimbledon champion Chris Evert said on the eve of Wimbledon where she is working as a summariser for broadcaster ESPN .
`` There are 10 women that can win a Grand Slam . It 's unpredictable . It 's still wonderful to watch . ''
Women 's world number one Simona Halep , who moved easily into round two , said seeds were even more vulnerable at Wimbledon where players often arrive with little grasscourt practice .
`` Here on grass , you do n't know what to expect , '' the Romanian said . `` Some players can play the best tennis . The top players can play a little bit less . You never know . ''
The men 's draw has already lost sixth seed Grigor Dimitrov , 10th seed David Goffin and number seven Dominic Thiem , the latter because of an injury during his match . French 17th seed Lucas Pouille was cast aside on Wednesday by Austrian qualifier Dennis Novak , ranked 152 places below him .
American Sam Querrey , seeded 11 , and Canada 's Milos Raonic , the 13th seed , both rolled through to the third round though .

Mumbai : The National Company Law Tribunal ( NCLT ) on Wednesday deferred to 9 July its judgement on a petition filed by Cyrus Mistry challenging his ouster as chairman of the Tata Sons group . NCLT Mumbai 's special bench of BSV Prakash Kumar and V Nallasenapathy was expected to deliver its order in the case on Wednesday but adjourned it to 9 July as the judgement was not ready .
Mistry , in the petition filed under the Companies Act , claimed that his removal was due to a result of mismanagement by the board 's trustees and oppression of minority shareholders of the group .
He had taken over as the chairman of Tata Sons group in 2012 after Ratan Tata announced his retirement . Mistry , who was the sixth chairman of the Tata Sons , was ousted from the position in October 2016 .
Two months later , Mistry and his family-run investment firm , Cyrus Investments , approached the NCLT , as minority shareholders , against the corporate monolith and others including Ratan Tata alleging oppression and mismanagement . Mistry in his plea claimed that his removal as chairman was without reason and amounted to the majority shareholders suppressing the right of the minority to ask questions about matters involving the company .
As per the plea , Mistry was five months later also removed from the post of director of Tata Sons ' Board for approaching NCLT . The Tata Group rebutted and said Mistry 's removal was because the board had lost confidence in him .
He ( Mistry ) intentionally and in bad faith leaked sensitive and confidential information causing a loss in Tata Group 's market value . He was appointed at the behest of Tata Trusts and his removal can not be questioned by minority shareholders , the group 's counsel , Abhishek Manu Singhvi , had argued before the
tribunal .
The Tata Group argued that the law clearly allows removal of a chairperson and director and Mistry was removed by a majority of 7 out of 9 , as Mistry had not voted for his removal and another official had abstained .
The first allegation by Mistry was that his removal as chairman and subsequently as director of the board Tata Sons was a result of oppression by promoters , who are in-turn owned by Tata Trusts that owns over 68 percent in Tata Sons .
The second part of the plea focused on the alleged mismanagement by Tata Sons board and Ratan Tata which caused revenue loss for the group .

Three brothers were arrested for illegal possession of firearms in Barangay Catarman , Liloan town , northern Cebu on Tuesday evening , July 3 .
Suspect were identified as Rafael Pontanar Jr. , Eugene Pontanar , and Aldrin Pontanar .
Supt . Randy Korret , Liloan police chief , said that the suspects threatened to shoot a certain Robinson Conahap after having a heated argument .
Korret added that the brothers fired two shots at responding policemen prompted them to shoot back .
One of the suspects was brought to the hospital after he was shot .
Confiscated from them were one 45. caliber pistol and a 357 magnum revolver .
The suspects are detained at Liloan police precinct pending the filing of charges against them .
BANGKOK : They may have successfully seized power twelve times in the last eight decades but Thailand 's army chief has said military coups are officially a thing of the past .
The comments caused much merriment on social media given the military 's long track record of toppling elected governments - the latest a 2014 putsch that brought the current military to power .
The military have promised to hold elections once a new constitution is in place , although the date for polls keeps slipping .
In an interview with Thai media outlets published on Monday ( Jan 2 ) , General Chalermchai Sitthisat was asked whether the military would intervene if civilian politicians disliked by the army brass were voted back in .
`` I can confirm that there wo n't be a coup . What would be a reason for having to have the coup ? There wo n't be a coup . We have already learned from what happened ( in the past ) , '' he said .
The remarks were soon seized upon in Thai social media , one of the few sites where dissent still flourishes given the military government 's ban on political gatherings and protests .
`` If the army says something like that it means they will do the opposite for sure , '' joked Eakapong Leesinla on Facebook .
`` Why ask such a question , '' added Pim Pongchandr on Facebook . `` We all know what he was going to answer , who would say yes ? ''
Chalermchai , a former head of Thailand 's special forces , was appointed by coup leader and current Prime Minister Prayut Chan-O-Cha in September . In 2014 , then army chief Prayut famously declared there would be no coup days before his military toppled the administration of Yingluck Shinawatra .
His predecessors removed her brother Thaksin in 2006 and have a raft of previous successful putsches to their name including three takeovers each in both the 1950s and 1970s .
Prayut says he was forced to seize power to curb political corruption and bring much-needed stability to the country after a decade of political turmoil between Shinawatra supporters and their opponents .
But critics say the putsch was an attempt by the military and its allies within Bangkok 's elite to ensure the Shinawatras , who are seen as champions of the downtrodden by large swathes of the rural and urban poor , are never in power again .
It was the 39th over of the Australian innings and the scoreboard read 183/4 . With both the batsmen in Jonathan Merlo and Nathan McSweeney well-settled at the crease , Australia looked all set for a total close to 300 runs .
The Indian bowlers and fielders did n't even panic for a moment as Australia had made a comeback into the match after losing three early wickets . Instead , they showed a tough mentality , temperament and attitude as it was evident from the body language of the players .
In a match like the final with the players being so young , big match pressure generally gets the better of the players . And it often affects the bowling side more than the batting side . However , the India juniors showed no such signs sticking to their disciplined approach without trying anything fancy and waited for the Australian batsmen to make mistakes themselves .
The match was there for the taking for both sides at that point in the last 10 overs . With the pitch favouring the batsmen , Australia could have really gone on to put up a big score on the board . Instead , they lost six wickets for just 33 runs in a span of eight overs , finally being bowled out for a paltry 216 runs , a score which was never going to be enough on that kind of pitch considering the run of form the Indian batsmen were in .
And when the Indian innings began , it was once again evident what the result was going to be considering the aggressive approach both the openers , Manjot Kalra and Prithvi Shaw adopted . There was no hint of nervousness or even a bit of tentativeness in the body language of the Indian players . It seemed like they had been in situations like these on numerous occasions as professionalism and maturity was visible in the way they were playing .
In many ways , they appeared to be much more mature and professional than their age group . Even their Australian counterparts seemed no match for them in an occasion like the final . They merely seemed like the usual boys of the U-19 world while the transformation of the Indian players from boys to men seemed to be complete .
Much of that can be attributed to the fact that nine of the players in the Indian playing XI had either first class or List-A experience under their belt . And a coach like Rahul Dravid 's guidance on top of that has definitely worked wonders for the India juniors .
Players are bound to make mistakes at this age level . They are bound to be nervous as well . Apart from one dropped catch which was quite a difficult chance early on in the Australian innings , the Indian players did n't let any chance go as far as their fielding was concerned . The Australian fielders , on the other hand , missed a couple of easy chances which only allowed the Indian batsmen to make the run chase even easier . Harvik Desai 's catch to dismiss Jason Sangha off Kamlesh Nagarkoti 's bowling summed up the difference in fielding standards between the two sides as well .
Even the bowlers bowled tight lines and lengths and did n't let the Australian batsmen to get any momentum in their innings . Yes , there were those occasional loose deliveries but the Indian bowlers corrected their mistakes quickly . The Australian bowlers did n't find any rhythm going in their bowling whatsoever . Even their best bowler in the side , Lloyd Pope was taken for more than eight runs per over in his five overs .
And talking about the batting , it was thoroughly professional once again with Kalra scoring a century in the run chase with all of Prithvi ( 29 ) , Shubman Gill ( 30 ) and Harvik ( 47 * ) making valuable contributions . They kept scoring runs aggressively and totally brushed aside any chances the Australian team had to defend that total . The Australian middle order had fought hard , but they could n't get on top of the Indian bowling for long periods and that was exactly where the game broke for them . The Indian players showed nerves of steel and were not intimidated at all by either the occasion or the opponents .
The Indian juniors were the most consistent team throughout the tournament claiming all 60 wickets of their opponents in these six matches . And from the batting point of view also , they never found themselves under pressure . That sums up why the Indian Premier League ( IPL ) franchises showed so much faith in the young players like Kamlesh Nagarkoti , Shivam Mavi , Gill , Shaw and Kalra , not only because they are promising players but since they seem totally ready for the big stage .
With this victory , their fourth World Cup title , the Indian juniors have once again established their domination on the U-19 world . They epitomised professionalism and maturity beyond their years coming out on top of the world with flying colours .
If day one of BevNET Live Summer 2017 offered the goods on how to innovate and scope out the future of the beverage industry , day two was a crash course in the nitty gritty details of monetizing that future .
Wednesday morning at the conference , held at Metropolitan West in New York City , began with a conversation with Bill Moses , the co-founder and former CEO of KeVita , a maker of probiotic beverages and kombucha . Moses gave his account of the brand 's evolution from conception to its high-profile sale to PepsiCo , which was announced in November 2016 . Early on , Moses saw an opportunity to gain market share and reach a broader audience by reducing the suggested retail prices of KeVita drinks to a mainstream-friendly option of $ 2.99 .
‚Äú At $ 2.99 we knew that we could gain trial , we could win at shelf , but we did n't have the gross profit margin ; we were running at the low 20 percent profit margin , ‚Äù Moses said . ‚Äú But what we really focused on doing is we took the time to look at the plan of execution to really get our cost of goods down and to get our profit margin up . Around that we premeditatively had a plan of execution . ‚Äù
Having a plan and a road map took KeVita to a sale , reported to be worth $ 230 million . Moses explained that KeVita focused on developing strong partnerships with co-packers and suppliers to achieve its pricing strategy . Although it often involved tough negotiation , the company 's efforts to reduce production costs were to everyone 's advantage , he said .
Investment was another big area of discussion on Wednesday . While Presence Marketing CEO Bill Weiland outlined emerging beverage category trends on day one , a panel of investors laid out the current state of beverage investment . Nick Giannuzzi of The Giannuzzi Group , Tom Spier of Boulder Food Group , and Mike Burgmaier of Whipstitch Capital ( which facilitated the KeVita/PepsiCo deal ) shared their insights from the money side of things about where the industry was heading in terms of financial growth .
Deals , Burgmaier said , are happening at earlier stages of a beverage 's lifecycle than any other time in recent memory . Giannuzzi described the market for investment as ‚Äú absolutely on fire . ‚Äù
‚Äú We get a call once a week from another brand that has the opportunity to sell , ‚Äù Giannuzzi said . ‚Äú And both the big brands ‚Äî the ones you 're going to read about for hundreds of millions of dollars ‚Äî and the smaller brands . And the acquirers are the traditional acquirers in the space , and there 's private equity firms saying we want 80 or 100 percent of the company and we 're willing to pay $ 20 million for it . ‚Äù
Later in the afternoon , Zoe Feldman , managing partner with venture capital firm Cleveland Avenue , shared her experiences learning the ropes of the food and beverage industry under the guidance of PepsiCo CEO Indra Nooyi and now former McDonald 's CEO and Cleveland Avenue head Don Thompson . Feldman discussed implementing those lessons in her work as an investor and incubation partner .
Continuing upon BevNET Live 's special focus on e-commerce retailing , speakers on Wednesday described an immense opportunity to connect one-on-one with consumers . Bonin Bough , host of The Cleveland Hustles , took direct engagement one step further when he put his person cell phone number on the cover of his book ‚Äú TXT ME , ‚Äù in order to get a better understanding of his customers .
Leveraging the addictive nature of mobile devices , Bough said , is key to entrepreneurial success in the modern day ‚Äî as evidenced by young companies like Facebook and Uber , which have grown to triple or quadruple the market capitalization of ones that have been around for more than 100 years . With new apps and technology , companies are able to access greater information about consumers , whether that come in the form of Facebook profiles or consumer engagement apps that turn research surveys into a recommendation product itself .
Through algorithms and aggregation , brands will need to adopt ‚Äú The Hacker Way ‚Äù if they seek peak success , Bough said . It was a powerful message , and one that followed up on a statistic offered by Kerrie Lopez , the Sr. Category Manager ‚Äì Fresh for Jet.com . In her presentation from earlier in the day , Lopez reported that 20 percent of food and beverage sales are expected to be online by 2025 .
As for getting hands on that data , CircleUp CEO and co-founder Ryan Caldbeck discussed Helio , his company 's machine learning aggregation tool that is currently tracking over a million companies .
‚Äú People are using data , ‚Äù Caldbeck said . ‚Äú And if you 're not , you 're probably being overtaken by someone who is . ‚Äù
Data , Caldbeck said , not only works to predict and drive consumer behavior , but it can predict a company 's chances for success based on known factors . The companies that succeed most often are the ones that do things differently than the crowd , he said .
But even in the era of hacking , artificial intelligence , and medically diagnosable cell phone addiction , BevNET Live was a showcase for the notion that a great mind will most often be the deciding factor in the world of business .

QUETTA , Aug 14 ( APP ) : Azadi Parade was held at Bughti Stadium Quetta on
Monday on the eve of Pakistans 70th Independence Day .
Chief guest of the ceremony was Governor Balochistan Muhammad Khan
Achakzai , along with Chief Minister Balochistan Nawab Sanaullah Khan Zehri and Commander Southern Command Lt. General Amir Riaz , he hoisted the national flag on the occasion , said a press release of ISPR .
A smartly turned out contingent of Pakistan Army presented salam to the
national flag , whereas renowned artists presented milli naghmas .
The ceremony was also attended by provincial ministers , members of the
assembly , high-ranked civil and military officials .
Speaking at the ceremony Commander Southern Command said that the
situation had changed a lot in Balochistan and the Independence Day was being celebrated with full entushiasm and national fervor throughout the province .
He said there was no part of Balochistan where the slogan Long Live
Pakistan was not heard .
Riots broke out in yesterday morning in the city of Nantes in western France after police shot a young man dead , highlighting the simmering tensions between youths and security forces in deprived urban areas .
Rioters set fire to cars and a medical center in the city on Tuesday night after news spread that an officer had shot dead the 22-year-old , named by local newspaper Ouest France as Bubakar , after stopping his car over an infraction . Youths clashed with police in the northwestern neighborhood of Breil where the killing took place , lobbing Molotov cocktails , before the unrest spread to two other poorer districts with a history of gang violence . Burned-out cars littered the streets on Wednesday morning .
The French government called for calm to ease tensions between police and the young protesters . Interior Minister Gerard Collomb condemned the violence , adding , `` All the necessary resources are being mobilized '' to `` calm the situation and prevent any further incidents , '' as reported by Agence France-Presse ( AFP ) . Local police chief Jean-Christophe Bertrand said the youth had hit a policeman with his car , lightly injuring him , after a squad stopped the vehicle at around 8:30 pm for an alleged infraction and tried to take him to the police station for identification . `` One of his colleagues then fired , hitting the young man who unfortunately died , '' Bertrand told reporters . He was hit in the carotid artery and declared dead on arrival at hospital , police sources said . Judicial police and a national watchdog that investigates claims of police wrongdoing are investigating to clarify `` the facts and determine in what circumstances the policeman used his weapon , '' said Pierre Sennes , public prosecutor for Nantes .
French police have a long history of strained relations with young people in poor , immigrant-heavy suburbs , not least since the death of two teenagers who were electrocuted while hiding from officers , sparking nationwide riots in 2005 . The assault of a young black man by police , which led to officers being charged , including for rape after a truncheon was shoved up the youth 's anus , sparked fresh unrest last year . In January , the government vowed a crackdown on urban violence after shocking video footage emerged of a policewoman being beaten by a crowd of youths in the Paris suburbs on New Year 's Eve .
Recalling the Amien riots during the time of former President Nicolas Sarkozy , a wave of civil unrest has occurred in Parisian suburbs where police intervened to quell unrest . The gang of youths attacked police officers with firearms and buckshot , and the cost of the violent protests runs into millions to repair the damage caused by urban youth .
Breil , the Nantes neighborhood where the young man was shot dead Tuesday , is a socially mixed district home to a large housing estate with a history of gang violence . Police boosted their presence in the area after a series of violent incidents on June 28 . Malakoff and Dervallieres , the other neighborhoods hit by riots on Tuesday , have been plagued by drugs and poverty for years . They fall into a category of problem neighborhoods that are to receive extra police help from next September under reforms by President Emmanuel Macron .
Political protest : How to vote for 'none of the above ' ‚Äî May 24
The story on declining one 's ballot shared some interesting points . The only laughable thing about the whole privacy situation is that you ca n't even take a picture of your own ballot and yet , if I want to make a point by refusing my ballot , I have to do it in full view of the assembled crowd of voters . This does n't sound at all like privacy to me .
Force India co-owner Vijay Mallya is considering changing his Formula One team 's name to make the outfit more attractive to potential sponsors .
LONDON : Force India co-owner Vijay Mallya is considering changing his Formula One team 's name to make the outfit more attractive to potential sponsors .
The Silverstone-based team have gone through various guises already , starting out as Jordan in 1991 and then becoming Midland in 2006 and Spyker in 2007 before Mallya took control in 2008 .
Force India have never had an Indian driver , while the team 's Indian sponsors were mostly brands linked to aviation and beer tycoon Mallya or co-owner the Sahara Group .
`` There is a growing feeling that maybe since we are a much-improved team in terms of performance and attracting more international sponsors , and sadly less Indian sponsors , there is a debate as to why the name should not be changed to give it a more international flavour , '' Mallya told motorsport.com .
`` There are some people who believe the current name Force India is restrictive psychologically .

`` I 'm considering along with the other shareholders what steps to take but it 's a major decision and one that is not going to be taken in a hurry without due consideration . ''
Mallya said there was a proposal on the table from one sponsor about a name change , and his current legal situation had nothing to do with the idea . Mallya last week rejected speculation about a possible sale .
The flamboyant 61-year-old was arrested by British police in April on behalf of the Indian authorities , who accuse him of fraud .
India is seeking Mallya 's extradition over unpaid loans tied to his defunct Kingfisher Airlines after the businessman moved to Britain in March last year . He has repeatedly dismissed the charges against him .
It is not the first time Mallya has mooted a team name change - he also did so in 2015 when there was talk of a deal with sportscar maker Aston Martin and whisky brand Johnnie Walker .
`` I named the team Force India only to give India and all of the motorsport fans in my country pride of place on a Formula One grid , '' he told Reuters at the time .
`` But they 've enjoyed that for eight years and now they know this team is synonymous and will still be an entry from India flying the Indian flag . So what name we run under is not as critically important as it was for the first three or four years . ''
Force India finished fourth overall last season , a position they currently occupy after seven races .

The Goods and Services Tax ( GST ) regime celebrated its first anniversary on 1 July . The biggest tax reform since independence , the GST was rolled out at midnight on 30 June by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the then President Pranab Mukherjee , in the central hall of Parliament . GST has subsumed over a dozen local taxes in its stated aim of ‚Äò One Nation One Tax ' .
Over 1.11 crore businesses are registered under the GST . Firstpost spoke to companies to find out what they view as the positives and the pain-points of the indirect tax regime . Almost everyone we spoke to said the GST has helped organise the unorganised sector to a large extent , and , in many cases , has revolutionised entire industries . However , our interviewees did dwell on certain aspects , in the GST regime , that can be improved . Industry speak follows :
Simplicity , clarity and comfort : The main aim of the GST was a simplified tax system . Being deliberated for over 15 years , it became a reality under the Narendra Modi government . The Centre was clear that if there were contentious issues , the GST Council would meet every month to sort them out . Farshid Cooper , Managing Director , Spenta Corporation , said that in the case of real estate , there ‚Äò seems ' to be significantly more clarity and comfort from a buyers ' perspective . The revision of rates from 28 percent to 18 percent for several construction materials helped vendors manage their cash flows more efficiently .
‚Äú People are more aware about their rights such as asking for a GST reduction benefit , ‚Äù said Adhil Shetty , co-founder & CEO , BankBazaar .
Boosts formal employment : The GST has given a boost to formal employment . Suchita Dutta , Executive Director , Indian Staffing Federation said that post-GST implementation , there is an incentive for customers to choose the services of tax-compliant staffing companies , which allows them to claim input tax credits ( ITCs ) that are n't available as a benefit .
Leg-up to manufacturing : GST has been able to reduce administrative costs for both manufacturers and distributors . Abhishek Agarwal , co-founder , Globepanda , said that it provides credit to producers and manufacturers that encourages them to buy from registered dealers , who in-turn bring more vendors and suppliers into the tax bracket .
On the first anniversary of GST , Union Minister Arun Jaitley said that as the tax collection from GST goes up , the tax structure would be rationalised further . He also said that the government is aiming to bring most items in the 28 percent tax slab to the lower slabs .
Addition of compliance work : The most persistent problem around GST has been the addition of compliance work . Prior to GST , businesses were expected to file their service tax and VAT statements on a quarterly or semi-annual basis . Now , sellers are expected to file a number of reports on a monthly basis online , which consumes a lot of time and makes running business operations more difficult , said Saahil Goel , CEO and Founder , Kraftly .
Changes in tax rates an issue : Since GST rates were changed frequently in the initial months , filings by businesses were lower than expected , said entrepreneurs . ‚Äú The frequent changes in tax rates of some goods and services and the introduction of new rules every now and then added to the confusion , ‚Äù said Anupam Singhi , CEO , William O'Neil India .
There are some categories that are negatively impacted by GST implementation . ‚Äú For instance , a 28 percent tax is applicable on financial leasing of a used vehicle , and I hope the government will reduce that rate over time , '' said Sandeep Aggarwal , founder and CEO of used-car marketplace Droom .
High rate of taxes : A very high GST of 18 percent is imposed on the services sector and it could discourage consumption in general , believe some . ‚Äú Considering that a majority of our GDP contribution comes from the services sector , the tax rate should be lowed , ‚Äù said Tejas Khoday , a member of the BSE Brokers ' Forum .
Include all realty : A demand for lower GST on real estate under construction or inclusion of all real estate properties in GST is important for properties where land costs are significant and impact overall pricing of property , said Ankur Dhawan , Chief Investment Officer , PropTiger.com . When service tax was levied , there was a 70 percent abatement for land cost ; whereas in GST , land abatement is only one-third of land value . This is a huge burden on apartment-buyers , said Ashok Mohanani , Chairman , Ekta World . Owing to the GST regime , the gross tax outflow on investing in a property has seen a steep rise of up to eight percent , said Manju Yagnik , Vice Chairperson , Nahar Group .
Incentives to traders : Traders have requested the finance ministry to review issues like filing of multi-returns ; refunds from the department ; awareness about the unified tax regime and its compliance .
`` A comprehensive incentive scheme should be given to traders -- who use digital payment gateways to comply with tax obligations and also use those gateways in their day-to-day business -- in the form of a rebate in tax , '' said the Confederation of All India Traders ( CAIT ) .
Merge or abolish stamp duty : Stamp duty continues to remain in force even after the implementation of GST and their rates vary across states , said Surendra Hiranandani , CMD , House of Hiranandani .
Central authority for advance rulings : The establishment of a central authority for advance rulings to regularly oversee and approve rulings made by state authorities needs to be strongly considered , said Archit Gupta , Founder and CEO , ClearTax .
Include additional taxes , levies in GST : If GST has to give an impetus to the real estate sector , additional taxes and levies should also be included within the 12 percent charged . That helps bring down the cumulative amount payable by a home buyer , said Rajeev Jain , Director , Nirmal Lifestyle .

In 2009 , Pimm defeated independent Arthur Hadland by just over 1,000 votes ( 43 per cent to 31 per cent ) .
History & Geography : The larger more rural of the two Peace River ridings , Peace River North was created in 1956 . The towns of Fort St. John and Fort Nelson are the largest population centres in this sparsely populated riding , which encompasses the most northeast section of the province . It has gone to the Social Credit , Reform , and Liberals parties , but the NDP have never received more than 30 per cent of the vote .

Bustle , the blog for millennial women , is hustling to close on around $ 30 million in new funding as it goes on the prowl for new acquisitions .
It 's a significant cash infusion for a company that has created a mini , millennial-focused media empire that reaches nearly 80 million unique monthly visitors across its sites .
The company , which acquired Elite Daily last year , was also reportedly in the mix for Rolling Stone and Mashable when those titles were getting shopped around .
Bustle has come a long way since founder Bryan Goldberg ( a co-founder of Bleacher Report ) announced its launch in 2013 . After an early stumble out of the gate following a less-than-glowing New Yorker profile , the company found its stride and kept its audience ‚Äî all while expanding its reach with the launch of new sites like the millennial-mom focused Romper .
Its Elite Daily acquisition seems to point the way forward for the company . Since Bustle first came on the scene , a number of new sites have launched to cover different industries from a women 's perspective .
Whether it 's The Relish 's take on sports , or Blue Fever 's new entertainment platform , new media is embracing a certain demographic of women consumers .
With the $ 30 million in fresh cash , Bustle will be well-positioned to roll up some of these new sites . The company has already raised nearly $ 50 million from investors , including GGV , General Catalyst , Saban Capital Group and Social Capital , according to Crunchbase .
For many people , the start of a new year is a time for reflection and resolving to do new things . For some , these decisions are inward-facing , or even deeply personal . We hope to take steps in the new year to become more healthy , wealthy , wise .
But some may also take this time of year to reflect on the greater world around us and where we sit within it . We think of the people and organizations that have helped us become who we are , and think about ways that we can help make them stronger and able to help others .
Whether you came to open source from a desire for personal freedom , a desire to share , or simply a desire to do things that would n't be possible with proprietary software and idea , we hope you 'll take 2017 to give something back to the open source community . And if you 're already an avid open source contributor , perhaps the new year is a good time to bring someone new into the fold , or think about a new way to give back .
How will open source be a part of your new year ?
Was ‚Äú Solo : A Star Wars Story 's ‚Äù disappointing opening a case of franchise fatigue or the result of tentpole overcrowding at the box office ? Its sophomore weekend could help crystallize what went wrong and where the ‚Äú Star Wars ‚Äù spinoff goes from here .
A strong holdover from the Han Solo origin story would signal that perhaps moviegoers were still barbecuing or catching up on ‚Äú Deadpool 2 ‚Äù over the holiday weekend , rather than dismissing the storied franchise 's latest outing . The ‚Äú Star Wars ‚Äù installment is eyeing between $ 50 million and $ 60 million at the domestic box office over the weekend . Even if it reaches the higher part of that range , it 's unlikely ‚Äú Solo ‚Äù will hit the second-weekend totals of its predecessors . The first ‚Äú Star Wars ‚Äù anthology film , ‚Äú Rogue One , ‚Äù made $ 64 million in its second weekend in 2016 , while 2017 's ‚Äú The Last Jedi ‚Äù earned $ 71 million in its sophomore weekend .
Disney and Lucasfilm 's second anthology film came in way underestimates , stumbling over the Memorial Day weekend with $ 103 million domestically and $ 84 million overseas off its $ 250 million budget .
‚Äú Deadpool 2 ‚Äù should make around $ 25 million- $ 30 million in its third frame . As of Tuesday , Ryan Reynold 's superhero sequel topped the $ 500 million mark worldwide in under two weeks . The 21st Century Fox film has earned $ 218.5 million in North America , along with $ 287 million internationally .
Since Fox moved the release of ‚Äú Deadpool 2 ‚Äù up by two weeks to May 18 , no other tentpole releases had filled the slot . Three new films will provide counter-programming against the recent takeover of action-adventure titles .

‚Äú Adrift ‚Äù hopes to anchor $ 7 million to $ 11 million in 2,900 locations . Shailene Woodley and Sam Claflin star as a couple who set sail across the ocean in 1983 . Loosely based on a true story , the two get stranded in the middle of the Pacific Ocean during a hurricane and attempt to navigate to Hawaii without communication or tools . Baltasar Kormakur directed the STX drama from a script by David Branson Smith , Aaron Kandell and Jordan Kandell .
Meanwhile , Johnny Knoxville 's ‚Äú Action Point ‚Äù is tracking between $ 4 million and $ 7 million , though estimates show it could make as much as $ 10 million from about 2,000 screens over the three-day period . The R-rated comedy , directed by Tim Kirkby , is Knoxville 's fifth collaboration with Paramount Pictures . ‚Äú Action Point ‚Äù follows Knoxville as the owner of a low-rent , poorly designed , and generally unsafe amusement park in New Jersey called Action Park . The film features stunts in the vein of Knoxville 's earlier comedies , such as ‚Äú Jackass ‚Äù and ‚Äú Bad Grandpa. ‚Äù Given the success of those movies , ‚Äú Action Point ‚Äù should easily make back its $ 19 million budget . The original ‚Äú Jackass ‚Äù opened in 2002 with $ 22.8 million . Its subsequent titles boasted bigger launches ‚Äî 2006 's ‚Äú Jackass : Number Two ‚Äù debuted with $ 29 million , 2010 's ‚Äú Jackass 3-D ‚Äù with $ 50 million , and finally 2013 's ‚Äú Jackass Presents : Bad Grandpa ‚Äù with $ 32 million . The franchise has earned over $ 356 million in total .
The final wide release is Jason Blum 's ‚Äú Upgrade , ‚Äù which looks to make around $ 3 million in 1,400 locations . ‚Äú Saw ‚Äù and ‚Äú Insidious ‚Äù helmer Leigh Whannell wrote and directed the horror title , which premiered at this year 's South by Southwest . Logan Marshall-Green plays a man who gets an experimental computer chip implanted in his spinal cord after he 's left paralyzed following a mugging . Betty Gabriel and Harrison Gilbertson also star .

Turkish and Russian officials will meet to finalise Turkey 's S-400 surface-to-air missile systems deal in the coming week , Turkish President Tayyip Erdoƒüan said on Monday .
ANKARA : Turkish and Russian officials will meet to finalise Turkey 's S-400 surface-to-air missile systems deal in the coming week , Turkish President Tayyip Erdoƒüan said on Monday .
Turkey has been negotiating with Russia to buy the system for more than a year . Washington and some of its NATO allies see the decision as a snub because the weapons can not be integrated into the alliance 's defences .
Turkey expects to receive its first such system in 2019 , defence Minister Nurettin Canikli said in November adding that the deal includes two S-400 systems while one was optional .
`` Our officials will come together in the coming week to finalise the S-400 issue , '' Erdoƒüan said during a joint news conference with his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin .
Turkey has been working to develop its own defence systems and equipment and has lined up several projects for the coming years including combat helicopters , tanks , drones and more .
Erdoƒüan also said Ankara and Moscow were on the same page regarding the U.S. move on Jerusalem and added that two leaders would keep in contact on the issue .

Copeland , of course , made his initial splash as the drummer for the mega-popular rock group the Police and has since branched out into composing music for film , TV , video games and opera . This is Copeland 's fifth opera ( he is also credited as co-librettist ) , and he has his chops in place . The 87-minute score has the feel and flow of opera spiked by occasional pastiches of rhumbas or '20s jazz and a minimum of rock .
An attorney for right-wing radio host Alex Jones plans to argue in a custody case that the Infowars founder and host 's on-air demeanor should not be used to determine his fitness as a parent .
Randall Wilhite said of his client during an April 2017 pre-trial hearing : ‚Äú He 's playing a character . He is a performance artist. ‚Äù Jones 's ex-wife , Kelly Jones , is seeking sole custody of the couple 's three children . She said she was worried because the children are present at his home during his broadcasts :
He 's not a stable person . He says he wants to break Alec Baldwin 's neck . He wants J-Lo to get raped . I 'm concerned that he is engaged in felonious behavior , threatening a member of Congress .
Her remark referred to the host 's use of an anti-gay slur against Rep. Adam Schiff ( D-California ) in a 30 March 2017 video . Jones also directed his comments towards Schiff : ‚Äú I 'll beat your goddamn ass , you son of a bitch. ‚Äù A week later , Jones said that the statements were ‚Äú clearly tongue-in-cheek and basically art performance . ‚Äù
On 13 March 2017 , Jones accused Alec Baldwin of trying to ‚Äú defame ‚Äù him and President Donald Trump in a Saturday Night Live sketch and challenged him to a boxing match , saying :
I 'll do it right now . I 'll get in the ring with you and I will break your jaw , I will knock your teeth out , I will break your nose , and I will break your neck . You coward , you think you 're tough guy , messing with little cameramen people .
A day later , he posted a follow-up video billed as an apology , which in reality was another commentary accusing Baldwin and the sketch comedy show of spreading lies about him and Trump . He said :
I 'm a human . I 'm actually trying to get freedom in this country . I 'm trying to actually promote jobs . I 'm actually trying to promote a future . I 'm not a globalist eugenicist that wants a post-industrialist world . I 'm for real . InfoWars is for real .
Jones , who supported Trump 's campaign for the presidency , has also claimed that the December 2012 mass shooting attack against Sandy Hook Elementary in Connecticut was staged . The school board in Newtown , where the school is located , sent Trump a letter in February 2017 asking him to denounce Jones for the allegation . As of 7 April 2017 , the president had yet to respond .
Jury selection in the Jones custody case began on 17 April 2017 . District Judge Orlinda Naranjo told attorneys for both parties :

ISLAMABAD , Dec 11 ( APP ) : Federal Minister for Commerce Muhammad Pervaiz Malik here on Monday said that the government would pass the amended bill of rent control act for Islamabad into the law during its current tenure to resolve this long standing issue of the traders of federal capital .
He said that government was fully cognizant of the problems being faced by the local traders due to absence of rent control law and assured that the parliament would soon pass its draft bill into law to promulgate a balanced rent control law in Islamabad .
He said this while addressing the business community at a dinner hosted by President Capital Traders Wing of PML ( N ) Sheikh Jamshed , said a press release issued here .
Pervaiz Malik assured that FBR related issues of business community would also be addressed to facilitate the growth of business activities .
He acknowledged that the country 's exports have witnessed some decline , but reaffirmed that government was working on many initiatives to turn around the falling exports and further enhance them .
Member of National Assembly Mian Abdul Manan said that he has discussed the issue of rent control act with Barrister Zafarullah Khan , Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on Law and he has assured to present its bill in the next session of the National Assembly .
He hoped that the bill would soon be passed into law that would help in redress of problems of traders and facilitate growth of business activities .
Speaking at the occasion , Sheikh Amir Waheed , President , Islamabad Chamber of Commerce and Industry said that with the consultation of all stakeholders , an amended bill of rent control act for Islamabad was prepared that was presented long time ago by Mian Abdul Manan in the National Assembly .
However , delay in its enactment was creating frustrations in the trading community as they were feeling insecure due to absence of rent law .
He stressed that government should pass the bill into law without wasting further time so that traders could do business with a sense of security and peace .
He said Pakistan 's exports have come down from 24 billion dollars to 20 billion dollars while the exports of regional countries including Bangladesh , Vietnam and India were going up and urged the government for addressing key issues of exporters on priority to facilitate the revival of dwindling exports .
The National Action Network is calling for a downtown statue to be taken down .
The John C. Calhoun statue has stood in Marion Square in downtown Charleston for more than 100 years .
Calhoun was a statesman , the seventh vice president of the United States , and a big supporter of slavery .
On Sunday , the National Action Network held a news conference in Whitepoint Garden and demanded the statue be taken down .
`` You can not make ugly pretty , '' National Action Vice President Nelson Rivers said . `` I do n't care how hard you try , hate is hate . Whether you mask it or not we ought to be leading the nation and taking it down . ''
On Monday , the chairman of the South Carolina Secessionist Party accused the National Action Network of using the violence in Charlottesville just to target the statue .
`` If you want to do something , own it and say you want to do it . Do n't wait for somebody to die to push your agenda , '' James Bessenger said .
The National Action Network wants Mayor John Tecklenburg to support taking down the Calhoun statue .
However , the land it sits on is owned by the Washington Light Infantry and the Sumter Guard .
Ultimately it could be up to the state legislature to decide if the statue stays or goes .
Under the Heritage Act , it takes at least a two-thirds vote by the house and senate to remove any Confederate monument .
If the statue remains , the National Action Network wants plaques put around it to tell what they say is the real story about slavery .
`` If they decide they want to keep these monuments up , then we want a platform up telling them exactly how much slaves they owned , how many kids they killed , how many families they divided , '' National Action Network State President Elder James Johnson said .
`` I think that 's ridiculous . If you want to build a new monument telling your own story what you think happened that 's perfectly fine , but you do n't go to a monument that 's been around for 100 plus years and start refacing it . That 's ridiculous , '' Bessenger said .
It appears neither side in the controversy over the statue is willing to give any ground .
Two news conferences are scheduled for Tuesday to address the violence in Charlottesville and the Calhoun statue .
The Charleston NAACP will hold a news conference at 11 a.m.and the National Action Network also is planning a news conference at noon .

Former US president Barack Obama will deliver the annual Nelson Mandela memorial lecture at a 4,000-capacity arena in Johannesburg in July , South African organisers announced on Monday .
Obama , who met with Mandela in 2005 and who made an emotional address at his funeral , will speak at the lecture marking 100 years since the anti-apartheid icon was born .
`` President Barack Obama -- we will be looking forward to hosting him as he will be addressing this esteemed Nelson Mandela annual lecture , '' Sello Hatang , head of the Nelson Mandela Foundation , said .
Hatang said the foundation had been seeking someone with `` an Africa heritage '' to deliver an address that will `` deal with issues of democracy '' facing the world today .
The New York Times said that Obama would spend five days in Johannesburg holding meetings , workshops and training for 200 young people in his most significant international project as an ex-president .
In his funeral address , Obama said Mandela `` makes me want to be a better man '' and hailed him as `` the last great liberator of the 20th century '' .

JAKARTA : A joint goal celebration by Christian , Muslim and Hindu players at Indonesian club Bali United , who prayed together after their team scored , showed how teammates should work together regardless of their faith , said defender Ngurah Nanak .
The photograph of Nanak , a Hindu , Muslim winger Miftahul Hamdi and Christian striker Yabes Roni praying alongside each other during their side 's 3-1 home win against Perseru Serui this month went viral on social media .
`` We did not plan it , but fortunately it turned into a positive message , '' Nanak said . `` So I hope it will have a good impact on everybody . ''
The 28-year-old said he had joined in with a traditional Hindu prayer gesture after he saw his teammates praying .
`` I never expected it to go viral . Because ... we just wanted to show our gratitude to God , because we won that match , '' added Nanak , who joined Bali United this season .

Bali is a predominantly Hindu enclave in Indonesia , which has the world 's largest Muslim population and is also home to sizeable communities of Christians , Buddhists , and people who adhere to traditional beliefs .
Religious tensions have spiked in Indonesia in recent months after Jakarta 's Christian governor was jailed for blasphemy after mass Islamist-led rallies .
Basuki Tjahaja Purnama denied he had insulted the Koran and critics of his trial said it was politically motivated .
Nanak said his teammates respected each other 's faiths and that helped in their game .
`` Because in a team we are different to one another but it 's important when we are fighting for one team , '' he said .
Bali United are currently fifth in the Indonesian Liga 1 .

Throughout the first three seasons of Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt , Kimmy was a nanny , a Christmas store clerk , a TaskRabbit employee , an Uber driver , and a college student ( forgive me if I forgot one or two in there ) . Naturally , Season 4 finds her in yet another new place of employment , at least in the first few episodes anyway . So is Giztoob from Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt a real company ? Year-round Christmas stores exist and TaskRabbit is a real thing , along with Uber , so it would n't be out of the realm of possibilities for Giztoob to also be a real company in real life .
In the promo showing the new opening song and Kimmy heading into work as a young professional independent woman , you see her head into an office at Giztoob , which is very much a step up from any of the jobs she 's had before . Since it 's unclear what her actual job title is or even what the company does , and the fact that there 's no search results for the company online , it 's safe to say that this time , Kimmy 's workplace is totally fictional . Really , it could be akin to any number of similar tech startups , so it could still draw from real life companies . It does seem pretty relevant in terms of the atmosphere . Giztoob seems to be a startup tech company , complete with a variation of one of those Yuko robots that was featured back in season one .
At Giztoob , Kimmy does seem to have a certain level of authority . In the promo , her very techy looking boss bursts into her office and orders her to fire another employee , so things are kind of sort of looking up for our cheerful heroine . Since this is a tech company though , and something tells me Kimmy can barely navigate a flip phone , she probably wo n't last long in her current position . According to Ellie Kemper ( Kimmy ) , though , it does offer an interesting storyline for the first episode .
`` She is working at Giztoob , which is the funniest name , and she is sort of like the human component , because I think a lot of people who work there are maybe introverts , so Kimmy has been hired to be almost the face of the company , '' Kemper told E ! News . `` I think this is her first professional job , almost , and I think she 's continuing her never-ending search to make the world a better place and right people 's wrongs , and as always coming to terms with the fact that she ca n't save everyone . ''
Giztoob also offers Jacqueline a place to launch her talent business , Jacqueline White 's White Talent ( I know , I do n't even know where to begin with that one ) even if she 's doing it under the radar and in a way that she probably should n't . That is , using one of the offices instead of paying for her own office space . You know , just Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt things . On the plus side , it means that Jacqueline is trying to be about working for a living instead of making money as a trophy wife again . Although Douglas , her `` yolo '' spouting younger boyfriend is set to make an appearance in season four , so you never know where Jacqueline 's story will go .
It 's not clear how long Kimmy is meant to work at Giztoob or how big of an impact the fictional tech company will have on the show this season , but like Kemper said , it does give Kimmy a jumping off point to finally begin her life as an adult . It 's like we 've watched her grow from this goofy socially immature person from season one into a goofy and still amazing cheerful adult person in the show 's final season . And I , for one , am totally here for it .
London : England 's all-time leading wicket taker James Anderson could be in line for a return to the national side for the upcoming five-Test series against India after undergoing rehabilitation on a longstanding shoulder injury .
The 35-year-old swing bowler -- who has taken 540 wickets in 138 Tests -- has been out of action since early June , but will hope to prove he is fit in a second XI match for his county Lancashire on 15 July .
Anderson is then due to play a County Championship match against old rivals Yorkshire in the `` Roses match '' on 22 July .
He has described the schedule for the Test series against India , which begins at Edgbaston on 1 August , as `` ridiculous '' with all five matches crammed into a six-week period .
`` England seamer Jimmy Anderson will make his return to competitive cricket for Lancashire second XI in a three-day match against Nottinghamshire at Old Trafford starting on July 15 , '' read a statement from the England and Wales Cricket Board ( ECB ) .
`` Anderson , who has not played since the second Test victory over Pakistan on 3 June , has spent the past month rehabilitating a long-standing right shoulder injury and returned to bowling working with Lancashire and England staff in the past seven days .
`` As part of his plan , before the first Test against India starting on August 1 , he will play for Lancashire seconds against Nottinghamshire and the Roses match in the County Championship Division One match against Yorkshire at Old Trafford starting on July 22 . ''
Anderson has struggled with the shoulder injury over the past two years and acknowledged after England squared the two Test series with Pakistan -- in which he took nine wickets at an average of 19.11 -- he needed to rest it , with the India matches coming thick and fast .
`` I just need to get in the gym and get it strong , '' he said in June .
`` The India schedule is ridiculous with five Tests in six weeks and that will put a lot of stress on it . ''

`` Labour demand is expected to remain uneven across sectors in 2017 . Total employment growth has moderated , while the unemployment rate has trended upwards and redundancies are expected in some sectors as the economy restructures , '' it added .
The mid-year payments will be made in July this year , and the Government will decide on the year-end annual variable component payment for civil servants after taking into consideration Singapore 's economic performance in the second half of 2017 , PSD said .

Crewe Alexandra 2 Wycombe Wanderers 1
There was little Valentine 's Day love for referee Michael Salisbury from Wycombe Wanderers ' travelling fans at Crewe Alexandra last night .
The official somewhat harshly gave a penalty against Sido Jombati to gift the hosts all three points seven minutes from time after Wycombe had fought their way level .
Jombati appeared to play the ball , and George Ray , if anything , looked to stumble over his leg - but Salisbury pointed to the spot and James Jones fired home the winner from the resulting penalty .
So aggrieved was Chairboys chief Gareth Ainsworth with the decision that he was sent from the touchline for his protests and had to watch the closing minutes from the stands .
Crewe had taken an early lead when Chris Dagnall 's shot proved too hot for Jamal Blackman to handle , and despite Jombati 's best efforts on the line , the ball just crept over .
Adebayo Akinfenwa looked to have earned Wycombe a point with 14 minutes remaining when he held off a challenge from the centre back after controlling a long ball into the box before slotting into the corner , but then came the late controversy .
TRUTH SHALL PREVAIL
CONCLUSION
It may not be as engaging as fiction . Some even consider it unattractive and dull .
But truth , like the soul , shall endure ; while the rest will be swept away .
‚Äú At present , truth is a lonely road . Not many want it because it 's inconvenient , ‚Äù said Fr . Roberto ‚Äú Bobby ‚Äù Ebisa , SVD , station manager of radio DYRF and president of the Kapisanan ng mga Brodkaster ng Pilipinas ( KBP ) Cebu Chapter .
‚Äú But as it is , truth is our barometer and compass . It is something we should always embrace and opt for , ‚Äù he added .
As heaps of lies continue to swarm the different portals of information , Ebisa urged people to be on guard and to resist all kinds of deceit , particularly the menace of fake news .
It may require swimming against the current or climbing steep hills , he said .
‚Äú Lying seems to be the new normal . It 's tough to fight lies . But why do n't we take the road less traveled and try our best to search and stand up for the truth ? , ‚Äù Ebisa said .
‚Äú Like crooked rivers that follow a path of less resistance , our life too will also be out of shape if we choose the path of less resistance , the easy way , the course without truth , ‚Äù he added .
Moral disorder
Dr. Maryjun Delgado , a veteran psychologist in Cebu , said people who disseminate lies have nothing but the thirst for power and money in their minds .
‚Äú They want to take advantage of the innocence of people and manipulate them . They find fulfillment when people believe the lies they make . It 's basically selfishness , power , and arrogance . And of course , money , ‚Äù she said .
Delgado called on people to be cautious so as not to fall into the trap of deceit , or much worse , patronize fake news .
‚Äú Please do not take every information you read as true . Do not be gullible . Instead , think and verify the contents of the information you encounter .
Remember that people with common sense are circumspect and are not easily fooled , ‚Äù Delgado said .
It 's about time , she added , to fight fake news ; otherwise people can no longer decipher which information to believe and which to reject ; not to mention , the reputations that are ruined by the numerous lies and deceit .
Delgado said honesty must be instilled in every family in order to mold each person at a young age .
‚Äú Young people are growing up with technology . They must be taught about the importance of truthfulness in their respective families , and we should not let truth pass us by , ‚Äù she said .
Plague
Jason Baguia , Mass Communications professor of the University of the Philippines Cebu , said fake news has become a barrier to effective communication .
‚Äú Fake news has challenged teaching because it is a communication plague , ‚Äù he said .
The phenomenon called ‚Äú fake news ‚Äù or ‚Äú disinformation , ‚Äù he said , has turned participants in communication either into victims of deception or into more skeptical , if not cynical , individuals .
‚Äú Skepticism or cynicism has made it difficult to facilitate the kind of dialogue that heals the wounds of division and builds communities , ‚Äù he said .
Baguia urged teachers and professors to continue proclaiming the truth to students in the hope that through studies , they will become more discerning consumers and producers of information .
At the heart of communication , he said , are the virtues of love and communion so that interactions will be more resistant to fakery and untruth .
‚Äú At the Final Judgment , everyone will have to answer questions like ‚Äò When I was a victim of fake news and therefore thirsty for truth , did you give me a drink ? , ' ‚Äù Baguia said .
Spirit of truth
Amid the spate of lies and volumes of untruth , Fr . Ebisa said that more than ever , truthfulness remains very relevant in the modern times .
‚Äú Nowadays , anyone can be the producer and consumer of information . Because of technology , anybody can post anything online . Gone are the days when editors of legitimate news outlets are the only gatekeepers , who decide what information to include in a publication , ‚Äù he said .
‚Äú In this fast-changing world , truth may have become unpopular . But we have to hang on to it amid all this information overload because deep inside every human heart is the longing for truth who is God himself , ‚Äù he said .
Ebisa also challenged print journalists and broadcasters to be agents of truth in an era of massive disinformation , knowing how every bit of information they disseminate affects human lives .
‚Äú Those in the media do n't only inform . They must also transform lives . For every time we publish or broadcast something , we 're not only dealing with numbers but persons with hearts . That is why we need to be very careful , ‚Äù he said .
The KBP Cebu Chapter led by Ebisa is currently conducting numerous seminars to fight fake news and educate people . KBP-Cebu is planning to join forces with the academe to make the campaign more effective and widespread .
‚Äú We start with the little things . The task may be tough but remember that the ocean , no matter how vast , is composed of droplets of water . Let us therefore start with the little things , and hope that it will eventually magnify , ‚Äù he said .
Victory
In the end , Ebisa said truth will triumph over lies no matter how insurmountable the obstacle may seem .
‚Äú To stand up for the truth is no easy thing to do . But truth is like a driftwood offering safe refuge in the vast ocean of information overload . We therefore need to rediscover it , and stand up for it in good times and in bad , ‚Äù he said .
‚Äú I believe that the truth will prevail in the end because the truth that we speak of and believe in is God Himself . The primary battle against evil and untruth has been won . And because God is truth , it will destroy all lies , ‚Äù Ebisa added .
MAYORS of Cebu 's towns and cities were reminded to ‚Äú be vigilant ‚Äù in securing themselves in the wake of the murders of two mayors in Luzon in recent weeks .
‚Äú Ang ako lang ikatambag nga be vigilant lang gyod permi . Karon man gud ang mga criminal wala nay kukahadlok nga mopatay ( My advice is for them to be vigilant always .
Nowadays , criminals are no longer afraid to kill ) , ‚Äù said Tuburan Mayor Democrito Diamante .
Last Monday morning , Tanauan City Mayor Antonio Halili of Batangas province was shot down while attending a flag raising ceremony outside City Hall . Halili was tagged by President Rodrigo Duterte as a narco politician .
The following day Mayor Ferdinand Bote of General Tinio town in Nueva Ecija province died in an ambush while onboard his vehicle in Cabanatuan City .
Diamante , Cebu chapter president of the League of Municipalities of the Philippines ( LMP ) , said the mayors of Cebu should have body guards with them to ensure their safety .
He said he received word from his LMP counterpart in Nueva Ecija that the two murdered officials had no bodyguards with them .
Diamante said he will convene a meeting with fellow Cebu mayors to discuss the deaths and what steps to take to protect themselves .
If you have the habit of including a smiley face emoji in your e-mails to your boss to create a positive impression , think twice . According to a study , the practice may undermine your prowess as well as the information you are sharing.The results demonstrated that in contrast to face-to-face smiles , which increase both competence and warmth , the smileys in an e-mail had no effect on the perception of warmth . In fact , it had a negative effect and the sender was perceived as less competent.The smiley also did not influence the evaluation of the sender 's friendliness . `` Our findings provide evidence that contrary to actual smiles , smileys do not increase perceptions of warmth and actually decrease perceptions of competence , '' said Ella Glikson , post-doctorate student at the Ben-Gurion University of the Negev ( BGU ) in Beersheba , Israel . `` In formal business e-mails , a smiley is not a smile , '' Glikson added.For the study , published in the journal Social Psychological and Personality Science , researchers conducted a series of experiments with a total of 549 participants from 29 different countries.In an experiment , the participants were asked to read a work-related e-mail from an unknown person and then evaluate both competence and warmth of that person . Some included smileys while others did not.E-mails that did not include a smiley were found to be more detailed and included more content-related information '' We found that the perceptions of low competence if a smiley is included in turn undermined information sharing , '' Glikson said.In addition , when the gender of the e-mail writer was unknown , recipients were more likely to assume that the e-mail was sent by a woman if it included a smiley.However , this attribution did not influence the evaluation of competence or friendliness , the researchers said . `` People tend to assume that a smiley is a virtual smile but the study showed that in the case of the workplace , at least as far as initial 'encounters ' are concerned , this is incorrect , '' Glikson noted .
A store with many stories , Ensemble has held a special place in the context of Indian fashion since its inception . Started by Tarun Tahiliani and his wife Sal Tahiliani in 1987 under the advisory of the late Rohit Khosla , the store soon found itself helmed by Tarun 's sister , Tina Tahiliani Parikh , currently the executive director .
While the careful yet expansive curation has offered the customer an immersive experience over the years , designers have had their own unique associations with the store . From helping to emerge talent edit their designs keeping commerce in mind , to nurturing them with knowledge of the basics , no one does retail in India quite like Ensemble .
On the day of Ensemble 's 30th anniversary , Vogue spoke to leading fashion talent in India about their journey with the store .

A Boots pharmacist working in Hartlepool wrecked his career after he stole steroids to give himself a bodybuilder 's physique .
Andrew Brown , 34 , acted out of vanity when he placed bogus orders for steroids and testesterone pills for himself at the Hartlepool Marina branch , Teesside Crown Court was told yesterday .
Prosecutor Harry Hadfield said that Brown , who was using an online coach to boost his muscles , placed his own orders for drugs and then intercepted the deliveries in Hartlepool and also at Boots stores in Stokesley , Middlesbrough and Guisborough .
The store had CCTV footage of him stealing drugs and ampules and then later walking out with them hidden inside his jacket .
Mr Hadfield said that it was a serious breach of trust , and the drugs were worth ¬£6,500
Brown 's defence counsel Damian Sabino said that it was `` a vanity thing '' , and that Brown 's career was now gone , after he had spent four years at university and six years in training with Boots .
Brown , from Hilyard Close , Stokesley , was given a 10 months jail sentence suspended for 18 months , 150 hours unpaid work , and 50 days rehabilitation activities after he pleaded guilty to theft .
Judge Sean Morris told him that if he had been selling the steroids or supplying them to others he would have gone immediately to prison .

DOHA : Novak Djokovic battled back from 5-1 down against world number 63 Jan-Lennard Struff to claim his first victory of the season at the Qatar Open on Monday ( Jan 2 ) .
The world number two lost his opening two service games and struggled with the German 's big serves in the early exchanges .
But the Serb rallied in determined fashion to eventually take the first-round match 7-6 ( 7/1 ) , 6-3 .
`` It was n't a great start , I was 1-5 down , it did n't look very good , '' Djokovic said after winning in just under 90 minutes .
He attributed his slow start to early-season rustiness rather than any long-term concerns over his form , following a relatively poor second half of the season in 2016 .
`` I guess I had to get more time to get the engine started . It 's the first match of the year , you never know how you 're going to start .
`` I mean , I was a bit flat on my feet , and Struff , credit to him for playing aggressive , hitting the serves well , and ripping ( the ) ball from the baseline .
`` But I stayed composed because I knew , I believed that I could find the rhythm , start reading his serve better , and that 's what happened . ''
Djokovic , who is the defending champion in Doha , hit 17 winners but also 20 unforced errors .
In total , his opponent thundered down nine aces .
The 12-time Grand Slam winner is looking to reclaim his number one ranking from Andy Murray , who is also in Doha , and is the tournament 's number one seed .
If matches go to form the rivals will meet in a mouthwatering final on January 7 .
Before the tournament , Murray said Djokovic would be his main rival this season , but the Serb said 2017 would be about more than two players .
`` We have the return of ( Rafael ) Nadal and ( Roger ) Federer that we can not count out in any circumstances because of their history and results and the quality of players that they are , '' he said .
Also on Monday there were victories for Dustin Brown , who edged past Argentina 's Facundo Bagnis in three sets in the first round of the singles , 6-1 , 6-7 ( 2/7 ) , 6-4 .
And number four seed , Belgium 's David Goffin , who beat Murray in an exhibition event in Abu Dhabi last week defeated Robin Hasse of the Netherlands , 7-6 ( 7/4 ) , 6-2 .
Murray 's begins his attempt to win the Qatar Open , an event he last won in 2009 , with a first-round match against France 's Jeremy Chardy on Tuesday .
The newly knighted Scotsman though was in action in the doubles on Monday , but he and partner Mariusz Fyrstenberg lost in straight sets to David Marrero and Nenad Zimonjic .
First round :
Nicolas Almagro ( ESP ) bt Paolo Lorenzi ( ITA ) 7-6 ( 7/2 ) , 4-6 , 6-3
Jiri Vesely ( CZE ) bt Anil Yuksel ( TUR ) 6-2 , 6-3
Dustin Brown ( GER ) bt Facundo Bagnis ( ARG ) 6-1 , 6-7 ( 2/7 ) , 6-4
Fernando Verdasco ( ESP ) bt Vasek Pospisil ( CAN ) 7-5 , 6-0
David Goffin ( BEL ) bt Robin Haase ( NED ) 7-6 ( 7/4 ) , 6-2
Radek Stepanek ( CZE ) bt Marcos Baghdatis ( CYP ) 6-4 , 5-3 retired
Arthur De Greef ( BEL ) bt Mohamed Safwat ( EGY ) 6-7 ( 8/10 ) , 7-5 , 6-4
Horacio Zeballos ( ARG ) bt Florian Mayer ( GER ) 6-7 ( 3/7 ) , 6-4 , 7-6 ( 11/9 )
Novak Djokovic ( SRB ) bt Jan-Lennard Struff ( GER ) 7-6 ( 7/1 ) , 6-3
Ontario Premier Kathleen Wynne and her cabinet ministers excel at alternative facts and fake news .
The latest example was Finance Minister Charles Sousa 's speech Thursday to The Empire Club , part of which boasted about how the Liberals saved Ontario 's electricity system by doing the heavy lifting needed to improve it .
As a result , Sousa said , Ontario 's electricity grid is now ‚Äú the envy of North America ‚Äù because the Liberals restored ‚Äú integrity and reliability ‚Äù to it , unlike neighbouring Canadian provinces and the rust belt states .
Simply put , what on Earth is Sousa talking about ?
Hydro One controls the transmission of electricity through 29,000 km of hydro lines in Ontario and provides electricity to 1.3 million customers .
In her December , 2015 annual report , Ontario Auditor General Bonnie Lysyk said between 2010 and 2014 , Hydro One customer experienced 24 % more power outages , lasting 30 % longer , while costs to run the system increased by 31 % .
She described Hydro One as ‚Äú consistently one of the least reliable among large Canadian electricity distributors ‚Äù .
She said its maintenance backlog increased by 47 % and power outages by 7 % , between 2012 and 2014 .
Lysyk reported the risk of power failures was increasing because Hydro One had n't replaced $ 4.5 billion in transmission assets , ‚Äú that have exceeded their planned useful service life ‚Äù .
In 2014 , former Ontario ombudsman Andre Marin reported that trying to get straight answers out of Hydro One on its horrendous customer billing practices , following complaints by 10,000 customers , was like , ‚Äú wrestling with a slippery pig ‚Äù .
He said Hydro One had issued more than 100,000 incorrect bills , covering everything from unexplained billings , to ‚Äú catch-up ‚Äù bills , ‚Äú estimated ‚Äù bills , multiple bills and over-billing .
Wynne is now selling 60 % of Hydro One to the private sector , putting it beyond the scrutiny of the auditor general and ombudsman .
Sousa said the government now realizes electricity rates are too high , which is why its cutting them by a total of 25 % in June ( by increasing the province 's debt to subsidize them ) .
While Sousa did n't mention it , prior to this announcement , the Liberals claimed electricity pricing in Ontario was in the middle of the pack compared to Canada and the US .
Hydro Quebec does an annual comparison of electricity rates in major cities , standardized for a monthly consumption of 1,000 kilowatt-hours ( kWh ) , with all prices in Canadian currency .
Its 2016 survey found electricity prices for residential customers in Toronto of 17.81 cents per kilowatt/hour and in Ottawa of 16.15 cents per kilowatt/hour .
That was higher than in Vancouver ( 10.70 ) ; Calgary ( 10.40 ) ; Edmonton ( 10.37 ) ; Regina ( 14.65 ) ; Winnipeg ( 8.43 ) ; Montreal ( 7.23 ) ; Halifax ( 15.88 ) ; Moncton ( 12.50 ) ; Charlottetown ( 16.02 ) ; St. John 's ( 11.96 ) ; Seattle ( 13.62 ) ; Portland ( 13.94 ) ; Chicago ( 15.19 ) ; Nashville ( 14.28 ) ; Houston ( 11.25 ) and Miami ( 11.67 ) .
The Toronto and Ottawa rates were lower than in San Francisco ( 31.05 ) ; Detroit ( 20.24 ) ; Boston ( 27.69 ) and New York ( 29.52 ) .
Thus , according to Hydro Quebec 's major cities ' survey , Ontario 's residential electricity rates are the highest in Canada and only in the mid-range when you add in American cities .
An accurate statement in Sousa 's Empire Club speech regarding hydro was that the system needed upgrading when the Liberals came into power in 2003 because of past neglect by governments of all stripes , including Liberals .
But much of it was firmly in the realm of alternative facts and fake news .

From a TorontoStrong banner hung in deep centre field , to a pre-game ceremony , the Blue Jays and Red Sox paid tribute to those affected by Monday 's senseless tragedy in the city .
Prior to first pitch , the Jays had a moment of silence with six of the first responders to the scene on the field to join in the remembrance of the 10 who died in the awful act of violence .
The depth of the tragedy certainly impacted the Jays players , who had an off day on Monday .
‚Äú These guys all feel it , ‚Äù Jays manager John Gibbons said . ‚Äú They 're players but they 're humans , too . I do n't think we can comprehend it really , unless it affects you directly .
‚Äú I think what 's really said is a lot of times we 're de-sensitized nowadays because it 's happening too often . ‚Äù
MLB commissioner Rob Manfred , making a visit to Toronto to meet with fans and team officials , offered his support as well .
‚Äú I want to say to the citizens of Toronto that all of us in Major League Baseball were devastated by the tragedy here , ‚Äù Manfred said . ‚Äú I hope that our game tonight will provide a little bit of a beginning to the healing process that will be important for the city . ‚Äù

ERIE , Pa. ( AP ) ¬ó A state court panel says a Pennsylvania man caught driving without a license 22 times got the punishment he deserved .
Randy Stallsmith had claimed that his 3-to 6-month prison term was excessive for driving offense No . 22 in 2015 . He pleaded guilty to driving without a license .
Pennlive.com reports ( http : //bit.ly/2lLxOB9 ) a state Superior Court panel upheld the sentence , saying the 49-year-old Erie County man 's past behavior sank his appeal .
Stallsmith appealed to the Superior Court because a county judge would n't allow him to serve his time on work release .

Stallsmith argued he should 've received a lighter sentence because he took responsibility for his actions .
The panel agreed with the county judge , saying with 22 offenses already on his record , Stallsmith `` provided no indication that his aberrant conduct would cease . ''

A LOCAL police official has cited the advantage of taking suspects or criminals alive during police operations .
Senior Supt . Joel Doria , Cebu City Police Office ( CCPO ) chief , said he believed that drug suspects or criminals should be given a chance to live .
But aside from that , police can also gain information from the arrested suspects or criminals .
ADVERTISEMENT
‚Äú As much as possible , we want to catch them alive because that will allow us to dig deeper and get more information about their operations , ‚Äù he said in an interview .
‚Äú If they are killed , then that 's it . So , we really want them to live and tell us about the extent of their operations , ‚Äù Doria said .
Doria 's reactions came amid the assurance of General Ronald ‚Äú Bato ‚Äù dela Rosa , Philippine National Police director , that police highly value the lives of people .
Dela Rosa was reacting to the latest Social Weather Stations ( SWS ) survey that said nine out of 10 , or 90 percent of Filipinos want drug suspects to be arrested alive .
‚Äú Sa kanila ( for them ) 90 percent ? Sa amin 100 percent . Mas gusto naming mahuling buhay ( For them , 90 percent ? For us , it 's 100 percent . We really want to arrest suspects alive ) , ‚Äù Dela Rosa said in an interview with GMA News TV on Friday .
‚Äú What 's the use of waging this war on drugs if you do n't value life ? ‚Äù he said .
The SWS results were released following a series of surveys related to the drug war .
An earlier SWS survey shows that 63 percent of Filipinos believe that drug suspects were killed even after they surrendered themselves to authorities .
PNP spokesperson Chief Superintendent Dionardo Carlos said that in their 71,393 drug operations conducted from July 1 , 2016 , to Sept. 30 , 2017 , about 109,090 drug offenders are alive and are now facing criminal charges .
For kids of the 1980s it might seem like we had the best time at the movies ever . More to the point , in our quest for the never-ending summer , it appeared like the movies we watched were never going to stop being made . And they have n't been . They 've just gotten bigger budgets , better production values , and , in some cases , better actors . None of this is more present than in the 2018 Summer Movie Season
There 's no denying such films as Meatballs , Stand By Me , Cloak & Dagger , Dirty Dancing , Caddyshack , Red Dawn , Friday the 13th , The Flamingo Kid , and many other films from the 1980s are classics . And there have certainly been excellent summer movie seasons in the 1990s , the 2000s , and other decades . However , 2018 has them ALL beat by miles .
Many of you are going to argue with me . You are going to be outraged by my claims and call the headline for this piece clickbait . The reality is that the 1980s were great . They were special , significant and they shaped a lot of what we are seeing in present day cinema . They are also over .
This is a fact that many people ( largely around my age group ) find very hard to get their heads around . Many of them ( and I suffer from this sometimes ) can not watch a movie without filtering it through the lens of the films from that decade . However , time has gone and even I , somebody who has made a film called 1985-1986 , had to accept this .
So sit back and get ready to have your mind blown . When you read the context that I put behind the 2018 Summer Movie Season , I truly defy you to think that it is not the best movie season ever . The sheer magnitude of its releases , coupled with the quality of those releases , is going to make your head spin .
Infinity War and Solo were released 13 Days apart .
Read that sentence about Avengers : Infinity War and Solo : A Star Wars Story again . And reread it again if you have to . Not only did we get an Avengers movie that totally changed the game for that series of films ( and for the superhero genre ) , we got a highly underappreciated Star Wars movie . Alright , Solo : A Star Wars Story might have only ( and I use that term relatively ) made $ 350 ( give or take ) at the global box office , but in 20-30 years from now that film and Star Wars : The Last Jedi will be seen as watershed moments for that franchise . It would 've been one thing to have gotten one of these films in a year . That we got Avengers : Infinity War and Solo : A Star Wars Story , and they both happen to be unlike anything we have ever seen from these kinds of films , is absolutely incredible . Add to this that Disney was responsible for both films and that makes the feat even more impressive . Disney is n't known for being groundbreaking , cutting edge or genre defying . The fact that one could say those three things about those two films is even more impressive .
Jurassic World 2 , Ant-Man 2 , Deadpool 2 and Mission : Impossible 6 , anyone ?
Studios competing with one another using tentpole projects is n't anything new . However , the caliber of projects competing against each other this Summer Movie Season is downright jaw dropping . So we have Disney with Avengers : Infinity War and Solo : A Star Wars Story . Universal brought us Jurassic World : Fallen Kingdom , Fox gave is Deadpool 2 ( which managed to be as good , if not better , than its predecessor ) , Disney gave us Ant-Man and The Wasp , and lastly Paramount has served up Mission : Impossible - Fallout . All of these projects stand to earn much more than $ 500 million and even that number is conservative . Ask yourself , has there ever been a summer where we have seen so many solid tentpole movies ? Have we ever seen such star power from competing films ? People like to cite the 1970s as a time when cinema truly opened up . Others cite years like 1939 when you had such films as Gone with the Wind and The Wizard of Oz . However , for sheer entertainment across landmark franchises and genres , I think you would hard pressed to find a better season than the summer of 2018 .
Black Panther may not be a summer movie , but it sure felt like one .
When you gross $ 700 million domestically you 've made a film that defies just about everything . Black Panther is that film . So strong was this movie that even after Avengers : Infinity War lived up to the hype ( and much more ) , people still felt that need to discuss , dissect and revisit Black Panther . Okay , this movie came out in February but it sure felt like a summer movie did n't it ? This film was n't about a race so much as it was about the human race . It defied categorization . For a superhero movie to achieve this monumental task that is truly remarkable . With a budget that had to be sizeable , it would n't have surprised anybody if the bean counters would 've forced the filmmakers to play it straight . However , maverick director Ryan Coogler has shown an ability to breathe new life into everything he touches . One need look no further than Creed or Fruitvale Station to see this point . However , Black Panther is a Disney film based on a Marvel property . It had every reason to play it safe . That Disney made such a splendid piece of cinematic gold only confirms that , when done right , big budget or otherwise , films can truly transcend their medium to become cultural touchstones .
Let 's not forget White Boy Rick , Ocean 's 8 , Sicario 2 , and Crazy Rich Asians .
The best part about all those above mentioned films is the fact that those are n't even all of the good , lower , medium , semi-big budget films opening during the 2018 Summer Movie Season ! Yet , if that was all that was being offered besides the above mentioned big budget , genre defying films , this would still be the best summer movie season on record . Simply look at White Boy Rick . This story of a young hustler on the come has been done to death . However , there 's something about this Matthew McConaughey starrer that seems special . Probably the fact that McConaughey is n't even the main character and the film still looks electric ! Then there 's Sicario : Day of the Soldado , a sequel that looks to be better than the original ! And given everything that is happening at the border , could this film be any more timely ? Now , I could break down the relevance of all the other films I mentioned , but there would n't be a point . 2018 is a special movie season . Somehow , amidst films that are sonically and visually blowing us out of the theater , we have these special films that , while not as bombastic , are managing to blow us away on an emotional level . That some of the huge blockbusters are also doing that , simply reaffirms what a special , summer movie season this is and has been .
And no list would be complete without Hereditary .
While not for everybody , the horror movie Hereditary is both scary , special , and already finding a place in what is a very stacked movie season . I could list out other horror movies to help bolster my point about just how special the 2018 Summer Movie Season has been . Yet , in this case , at least as far as horror and Hereditary are concerned , if you see this one horror movie this summer season , make sure that it is this film . Rich with symbolism , supernatural moments , and downright weirdness , Hereditary plays like Rosemary 's Baby and Phantasm had a child . Again , this movie is n't for everybody . It asks viewers to make a logistical leap that many might find hard to scale . However , if you are game , Hereditary makes it all worth it . With it 's shocking moments , indelible performances , and overall strength , Hereditary is a horror movie that is pushing its own genre . Again , the summer movie season in 2018 was doing just fine but this film only bolstered my case . Taken together , film for film , their content and what their releases represent , the 2018 Summer Movie Season is the finest moviegoing season any summer has ever seen .
When the Maple Leafs gathered at the MasterCard Centre on Tuesday morning for a team meeting , one of the last pieces of video they watched was of Connor Brown and his relentless work ethic .
Not a great save by Frederik Andersen , not a pretty goal by Mitch Marner ‚Äî though those kinds of things , rightfully so , have been shown on highlight-reel loops .
The Leafs will need all players going in the right direction in Game 7 on Wednesday night at TD Garden against the Boston Bruins , and you can bet players such as Brown , Zach Hyman and Tomas Plekanec will continue to set an example .
Leafs coach Mike Babcock certainly would hope so . In answering a question about Brown , the coach strayed from the usual nickname of ‚Äú Brownie ‚Äù he has bestowed on the 24-year-old .
‚Äú I thought Brown Cow was unbelievable ( in the Leafs ' Game 6 victory on Monday night ) , ‚Äù Babcock said . ‚Äú You put your work ethic first , your skill really comes out . I think that 's what you see in the ( Patrice ) Bergeron line ( for the Bruins ) .
‚Äú A guy like Brownie has showed it the whole playoffs , a guy like ( Zach ) Hyman , it shows . If you 're competitive , it shows . ‚Äù
Something similar can be said of Plekanec . It 's a little hard to believe he is the same player who started the series with not much in the way of interest . The veteran centre was put in a defined role when Nazem Kadri was suspended and then stayed between Patrick Marleau and Mitch Marner .
In short , Plekanec is doing what the Leafs were counting on him to do when they acquired him from the Montreal Canadiens in February .
‚Äú It 's done a lot for us , ‚Äù Babcock said of the Plekanec option . ‚Äú Marleau and Marner have been as good as forwards as you can have in this series . You put Plek in there and they 've done a nice job .
‚Äú They 've got to do it again . We 're not going to get last change ( in Game 7 ) and we 'll see what adjustments we need to make that better for us . He has been real good . ‚Äù
The soft-spoken Plekanec has become a valuable resource in the dressing room .
‚Äú When you talk to him about the game , he has a unique look just because he has played 900-plus games , ‚Äù defenceman Morgan Rielly said . ‚Äú Whenever you are on the ice with a guy with that much experience , it 's good because he has been in these situations and he is calm and understands the game . ‚Äù
Thanks to the Leafs ' ability to dig in , the series has boiled down to a best-of-one , which few believed would happen after the Leafs were spanked in the first two games in Boston . Rielly was n't sure the Leafs would draw on past experiences in games that represent such finality , whether it has been in junior , at the international level or in the minors .
‚Äú I do n't know if you can , ‚Äù Rielly said . ‚Äú I think you just have to go in there , be mentally calm and play . ‚Äù
While players do n't look too far ahead , Rielly and his teammates know the reward with a victory on Wednesday : A trip to the second round , which would be the Leafs ' first advance past the first round since 2004 , and a date with the Tampa Bay Lightning starting this weekend .
‚Äú You imagine ( moving on ) during the summer , during the season and you get to this point and you draw from those thoughts , ‚Äù Rielly said , ‚Äú and it makes you motivated . ‚Äù
The Leafs expect a different Bruins team , to an extent . After all , Boston has not yet faced elimination in the series , while the Leafs have persevered twice .
‚Äú Whenever a team has their back up against the wall , they come with their best effort , ‚Äù Rielly said . ‚Äú That 's what we can expect . Now that we have played two games playing for our lives , I think it 's going to help us . ‚Äù
Determination , execution and discipline will be keys for the Leafs . They 're going to be ready .
‚Äú You 're a kid playing outside road hockey , it 's the seventh game and you 're scoring a winning goal in overtime , ‚Äù Babcock said . ‚Äú That 's just the way it was your whole life .
‚Äú It should be a lot of fun . Let 's embrace it . ‚Äù

The other day , as he was squiring girlfriend Hailey Baldwin around the Hamptons , Justin Bieber 's car broke down in the middle of the road . In one video , uploaded to Instagram by a passerby , the pop star is hovering outside his gullwing Mercedes-Benz SLS AMG and waving oncoming vehicles around the $ 200,000 obstacle . He notified the East Hampton Town Police , which in turn dispatched officers and a tow truck . Before the mechanical failure , he was reportedly going to church ‚Äî church !

Imagine Justin Bieber as a pious traffic cop concerned with road safety . Even God must be stunned by this transformation . Not that long ago , if one of his pricey whips had stalled in public , Bieber would 've smashed the windshield with a tire-iron before mooning passing motorists . Back when he was urinating in a bistro bucket and egging a neighbour 's mansion and attempting to sneak a monkey without travel papers into Germany , Bieber was not as he appeared in the Hamptons this week : calm and responsible .

He was unhinged . If the words ‚Äú Justin ‚Äù and ‚Äú car ‚Äù were jammed into the same headline , there was a 95 per cent chance the tragicomic tale was about drag racing or careless driving or a hit-and-stay accident with a paparazzo . The kid who started out as a YouTube phenom , the tween heartthrob with the cherubic face and real musical chops , seemed to be on a fast track to the big house . A fall from grace was all but inevitable . You could feel it in the tabloid blotter . But those days are increasingly a fuzzy memory . While the new Bieber still looks like a scruffy vagabond who is capable of guzzling sizzurp before starting a violent club brawl , he is now on a slow track to a big turnaround . Against all odds , Bieber has pulled it together . And if this lasts , it means he is also a man of his word . About a year ago , after he cancelled the final leg of his Purpose tour , Bieber posted a heartfelt note on Instagram . He expressed gratitude to his army of Beliebers and confessed how ‚Äú insecurities ‚Äù had gotten the best of him . He regretted allowing his life to be overrun with ‚Äú bitterness , jealousy and fear . ‚Äù
Then he wrote : ‚Äú Me taking this time right now is me saying I want to be SUSTAINABLE . I want my career to be sustainable , but I also want my mind heart ( sic ) and soul to be sustainable . So that I can be the man I want to be , the husband I eventually want to be and the father I want to be. ‚Äù While the repeated use of ‚Äú sustainable ‚Äù made him sound like endangered cod , it turns out Bieber was swimming with sincerity . He had gazed into the abyss of celebrity malfeasance and winced at his antics . He hated what he had become .

He was n't ducking responsibility . He was climbing on top of it . And now when I gaze into my Bieber crystal ball , I do n't see mug shots and international incidents . I see wedding vows and car seats in the back of a supercar . I see Bieber erasing the folly of his past by striving for a better tomorrow . I see him eventually ferrying his kids to little league and coming home with anniversary roses . I see Bieber and Baldwin ‚Äî or maybe it 'll be Selena Gomez at the altar ‚Äî hosting dinner parties with other shockingly boring married couples who nibble on canap√©s while debating politics , private schools and luxury vacations . I see Bieber removing his tattoos and giving Bible lessons to troubled youth . I see him knocking it off with the PDA ‚Äî in the last two weeks Bieber and Baldwin have made out in public more times than Nikki Bella and John Cena have broken up ‚Äî and gradually protecting his relationship inside a cocoon of privacy , where publicity is no longer craved and growing old together is the unspoken goal . And you know what ? We should all be happy for him . Sure , I may professionally mourn the loss of a reliable crap-disturber . If Bieber is n't spitting on fans or vandalizing foreign monuments , if he is n't getting into trouble , this will likely cost me six to eight columns over the next five years . But while a part of me may secretly wish for drama between Bieber and The Weeknd , or an incident in which Bieber is arrested for dropkicking a sports mascot , there shall be no requiem for a bad boy , not today . Justin Bieber was a lost soul adrift in a playground of material excess . Fame did n't sneak up on him ‚Äî it took him hostage . He was a superstar teen with unlimited potential and resources , but dubious supervision and guidance . Throughout his meteoric rise , Bieber 's life was going sideways . Now he 's altering the trajectory . At long last , now he 's finally in control . Vinay Menon is the Star 's pop culture columnist based in Toronto . Follow him on Twitter : @ vinaymenon

LOS ANGELES -- `` Yeeeeaaahhhhhh ! '' Brent Celek screamed as he stood on the 20-yard-line at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum on Sunday evening , his triumphant howl marking the end of the Philadelphia Eagles ' nine-day West Coast odyssey . The 32-year-old tight end 's eyes were ablaze with emotion as he celebrated a come-from-behind , 43-35 victory over the Los Angeles Rams that clinched the NFC East and vaulted his team back to the top of the NFC playoff chase .
It was pure joy -- except , of course , it was n't .
Philly 's 11th win in 13 games was its most impressive to date , but it came with a stomach-churning caveat : second-year quarterback Carson Wentz , whose prolific play in 2017 has pushed him into the MVP conversation , exited the game after suffering a third-quarter injury to his left knee that the Eagles fear is a torn ACL . And when Celek , nearly an hour after the game 's cheerful conclusion , walked up the tunnel leading out of the stadium and headed toward the team buses , his mood was far more muted , and he was mindful of the challenge he and his teammates are likely to confront in the weeks to come .
For as it turned out , the Eagles ' long-awaited signature victory coincided with a torturous twist that will cause many people to write them off .
`` Well , we got that epic win , '' Celek said , shaking his head . `` And our quarterback went down . That 's life . We 've all got to step up . We lost ( All-Pro left tackle ) Jason Peters , and we kept winning . We lost ( veteran running back ) Darren Sproles and ( young middle linebacker ) Jordan Hicks , and we fought through it . And if we do n't have Carson , we 've all got to be just as good as we were today -- if not better -- to pick up the slack . We 've all got to elevate our play . ''
It 's a compelling clarion call , but it appears to be a highly ambitious one , even in the wake of the Eagles ' spirited resilience against their NFC West-leading foes . In a highly anticipated showdown between the emerging quarterbacks who went 1-2 in the 2016 NFL Draft , it was unsung veteran Nick Foles who threw the pivotal passes in crunch time . And Foles got a major assist from a fellow former Ram , veteran defensive end Chris Long , whose strip sack of Jared Goff with 8:13 remaining ( recovered , naturally , by another ex-Rams player , safety Rodney McLeod ) set up Jake Elliott 's 33-yard field goal that put Philly ahead for good .
When defensive end Brandon Graham snatched Tavon Austin 's last-gasp lateral and rambled 16 yards for a touchdown with no time remaining , it was time for the Eagles -- and a sizable portion of the Coliseum crowd of 67,752 -- to party like it was 2013 . That was the year that Foles , during his first stint in Philly , threw 27 touchdowns and only two interceptions in leading the Eagles to their last division title and playoff appearance , under then-rookie coach Chip Kelly .
Now the catalyst behind this Philly team 's surprising rise to the top of the conference appears to have taken his final snap of 2017 . And Celek , of all people , understands just how daunting Wentz 's absence may turn out to be .
On Saturday , as he sat in the lobby bar of the Eagles ' team hotel , Celek was asked if he 'd seen the Eagles ' success coming in the wake of a 7-9 season in 2016 .
`` Not really , '' he admitted . `` I mean , I felt like we 'd gotten better . But the biggest reason , by far ? It 's Carson . He 's a monster . He 's doing things that are ridiculous . And when he 's on , we feel like our offense ca n't be stopped . ''
The Eagles had in fact been felled the previous Sunday night in Seattle , losing a 24-10 slugfest to the Seahawks that ended Philly 's nine-game winning streak . They spent the next week in Orange County quietly seething as they prepared for a Rams team that had already secured its first winning season since 2003 .
They started ignominiously , with Wentz ( 23 for 41 , 291 yards ) throwing an interception to cornerback Kayvon Webster -- who would later leave the game with a season-ending torn Achilles tendon -- on the game 's third play from scrimmage . Three plays later , Rams running back Todd Gurley ( 13 carries , 96 yards ; three receptions , 39 yards ) scored the first of his two touchdowns , giving L.A. a 7-0 lead .
Then Wentz got hot , throwing scoring passes to tight ends Celek ( five yards ) and Trey Burton ( 20 yards , 11 yards ) on three consecutive possessions to put the Eagles up 21-7 . However , Goff ( 16 of 26 , 199 yards ) countered with touchdown throws to receivers Cooper Kupp ( five catches , 118 yards ) and Sammy Watkins to cut the lead to 24-21 , and L.A. went ahead 28-24 after Blake Countess scooped up teammate Michael Thomas ' blocked punt and ran 16 yards to the end zone with 10:07 left in the third quarter .
Had that been the Eagles ' lowest moment , this would have been a sublime Sunday . Alas , with four minutes left in the third quarter , Philly 's fortunes got much , much , much worse .
On first-and-goal from the 2 , Wentz took a shotgun snap , scrambled to his right and dove for the end zone , getting sandwiched between defensive end Morgan Fox and linebacker Mark Barron as he crossed the goal line , with his knee absorbing the bulk of the force . The touchdown was nullified by a holding penalty on right tackle Lane Johnson , and Wentz stayed in the game for a pair of handoffs before summoning what was likely one final burst of brilliance in a tremendous season .
On fourth-and-goal from the 2 , Wentz took a shotgun snap , pumped and stood firm as outside linebacker Matt Longacre collapsed the pocket . At the last instant he zipped a pass that barely evaded the right hand of Eagles wideout Nelson Agholor and , just before hitting the ground , was expertly plucked out of the air by Philly receiver Alshon Jeffery just inches away from the fingertips of safety Lamarcus Joyner .
It was Wentz 's fourth touchdown pass of the game and 33rd of 2017 , an Eagles single-season record . And then , suddenly , he was walking gingerly to the locker room with a towel over his head , his knee seemingly unstable , his hand covering his eyes as he strode through the end zone tunnel .
When Gurley bulled in from a yard out with 13:58 remaining in the game , with the extra point staking the Rams to a 35-31 lead , the Eagles could have wilted without their leader . Instead , they regrouped and rallied around Foles ( 6 of 10 , 42 yards ) , who engineered drives that led to Elliott field goals on each of Philly 's next two possessions .
The second was set up by Long 's strip sack , evoking memories of the huge plays made by his Hall of Fame father , Howie , in this same stadium for the Raiders back in the day .
`` We knew we had to make a play , no matter what , because we had n't been making a whole lot of plays on defense , '' Long said . `` Doug ( Pederson , the Eagles ' second-year head coach ) does a good job of keeping everybody even-keeled , and our team handles these situations really well . A lot of things went wrong for us , but we were really resilient . ''
Defensive tackle Fletcher Cox , who continued an All-Pro-caliber season with another stellar effort Sunday , agreed : `` We knew the defense had to go out and win the game , and that it was our time . ''
Pederson , too , did his share of tone-setting : With six minutes remaining , Elliott booted a 54-yard field goal to give the Eagles an apparent 37-35 lead , but Aaron Donald was whistled for a launching penalty , a 15-yard personal foul . Pederson took the penalty -- and took points off the board . Though the ultimate outcome was the same , with Elliott converting a 33-yard field goal with 3:45 remaining , Pederson 's bold call bled the clock and sent a message to his players .
`` I wanted the touchdown , '' Pederson said as he left the stadium . `` I wanted to stay aggressive , and show that aggressiveness to our team -- to show them that we were still going after it . And Nick was great . To get thrown in like that and battle and do what he did , it 's unbelievable . ''
After the Eagles forced a Rams three-and-out , Pederson remained aggressive , calling a pass on third-and-8 from his own 23 , and watching Foles zip a nine-yard completion to Agholor that all but clinched the game .
That left the Rams ( 9-4 ) a game ahead of the Seahawks ( 8-5 ) in the NFC West , and in a precarious position : L.A. lost its first meeting with Seattle , and the rematch is this Sunday at CenturyLink Field .
`` It 's a must-win , '' Goff declared Sunday night . `` It 's a big one . ''
Goff was n't in the best mood , but he also knew he had emerged from Sunday 's showdown in better shape than his friend and rival . Wentz , who did n't speak to reporters , emerged from the locker room wearing an NFC East champions cap , a black long-sleeved shirt , black shorts and a black brace on his left knee on this Black Sunday .
After loading up a plate of Mexican food , Wentz boarded the back of a cart that drove him up the tunnel and beyond a chain-link fence that shielded the Eagles ' buses from the masses . Facing backward , Wentz checked his phone as he exited the stadium while being trailed by a slew of reporters and camera crews , doing his best to tune out the drama . After entering a secure area , he boarded Bus # 1 and began a long trip back to Philly , where on Monday he was scheduled for an MRI that should reveal the extent of his injury .
Ten minutes later , Foles came out of the visitors ' locker room smiling . He exchanged warm greetings with some of his former Rams teammates , and other staff members , as he made his way out of the stadium .
`` I 'm ready to roll , '' he said .
He 'd better be . Meanwhile , Celek and the rest of the Eagles insist they 're not ready to roll over , even after a gut punch that took the air out of their division-clinching celebration .

Lexi Comeau-Jackson may be just nine-years-old , but she 's being hailed a hero for saving her brother 's life .
‚Äú She saved his life . She definitely did because things happened so quickly , ‚Äù said her mother , Kelly Comeau-Jackson .
‚Äú It could have been worse but it was n't because of her . ‚Äù

Lexi 's brother , Leeland , opened the door and went outside on his own while the family was getting ready to celebrate Lexi 's birthday party .
The 18-month-old then fell into the pool , which is when Lexie let out a loud scream .
‚Äú I died at that moment , ‚Äù Comeau-Jackson says of seeing the top of her son 's head in the pool .
‚Äú You know when you 're having a nightmare and you feel like you 're screaming and nothing is coming out ? I was screaming so loud and I just felt like there was nothing I could do . I knew I could n't get down the stairs in time so I 'm praying that my mom 's hearing me yell while I 'm running down the stairs . ‚Äù
Leeland was quickly taken out of the pool by his grandmother and is doing fine .
‚Äú You know you 're praying , ‚Äò Oh please , please be okay. ‚Äù And I took him out right away and he moved and I go , ‚Äú He 's okay , ‚Äù and I opened his mouth and the water came out , ‚Äù said Nancy Comeau-Drisdelle , the children 's grandmother .

What makes this story even more incredible is that Lexie lives with cerebral palsy and is non-verbal .
Councillor Tony Mancini heard about the ordeal and met with Lexie and her family . On Wednesday , Mancini took them on a tour of Halifax City Hall , where Lexie got to explore and even sit in the mayor 's chair in council chambers .
‚Äú It 's such a good story and it could have been a different story altogether , ‚Äù said Mancini .
‚Äú The fact that she 's in a wheelchair , non-verbal and she was able to communicate enough to make it crystal clear that something was wrong and you meet her and she 's beautiful , she 's so bright , she 's so happy . Those are the stories we need to share . ‚Äù

For the first time , information about the San Pedro River Aquifer is now available from both the U.S. and Mexico in a new , collaborative report issued from the International Boundary and Water Commission , the Mexican National Water Commission , the U.S. Geological Survey and the Universities of Arizona and Sonora .
Groundwater in the San Pedro River basin is a vital resource for the people and environment of both the U.S. and Mexico . The study marks the first time that federal government and university scientists from both countries have collaborated to collect data and jointly prepare binational and bilingual databases and maps of the Binational San Pedro River Aquifer , which spans the border between the States of Arizona and Sonora . The maps in this report illustrate how water , geology , climate and vegetation are integrated across the border . Results build a foundation for understanding and can be used by agencies , land managers , universities and decision-makers to make informed choices about current and future water resources .
‚Äú Understanding the Binational San Pedro River Aquifer and other transboundary aquifers is the first step in planning for a clean and adequate water source for future generations , ‚Äù said USIBWC Commissioner Edward Drusina , P.E . ‚Äú I am confident that this new binational partnership that developed under this project , led by cooperative , responsible experts with our support , will continue to study our border ground water . ‚Äù
Until this report was published , scientists in each country had limited access to data related to geology , soils , vegetation , climate and other water-related subjects . This was due to a variety of reasons , including differing languages and classification schemes . For example , geology , which is the foundation of all aquifer studies , was classified differently in each country , posing challenges for understanding groundwater quantity and flow . For this report , geologic units were reclassified so that a truly cross-border understanding of the geology now exists .
‚Äú This study produced much more than a report , it opened doors to a thriving scientific relationship between the U.S. and Mexico , ‚Äù said James Callegary , USGS scientist and lead author of the study .
Findings improve the understanding of groundwater flow and how it 's connected between the U.S. and Mexican parts of the aquifer system in this basin . Future studies will use this information as a foundation to advance our knowledge of the hydrology of the binational aquifer . Further research is currently being planned , and ongoing studies are being conducted in Texas , New Mexico and Arizona .
‚Äú The Transboundary Aquifer Assessment Program is a unique partnership of government agency researchers and universities in the U.S. and Mexico , ‚Äù said Sharon Megdal , Water Resources Research Center Director , University of Arizona . ‚Äú It is gratifying to see the culmination of this binational , collaborative effort to characterize the transboundary San Pedro Aquifer . We look forward to sharing our findings with stakeholders in the region . ‚Äù
AJACCIO , France : Corsican nationalists said on Monday it was time for talks with Paris on greater autonomy for the French Mediterranean island , after they won nearly two thirds of seats in local elections .
Support for their cause in Sunday 's vote was boosted by dissatisfaction with France 's mainstream parties , a trend that has fuelled secessionist ambitions in other parts of Europe .
Nationalist leader Gilles Simeoni hailed the start of a new era after the two-party Pe a Corsica ( For Corsica ) alliance that he heads took over 56 percent of Sunday 's vote and 41 of 63 seats .
Unlike in Catalonia , nationalists in Corsica have downplayed any ambitions for secession , saying the island - where Napoleon was born in 1769 - lacked the Spanish region 's demographic and economic clout .
But Simeoni said he was seeking a greater say for local authorities on fiscal issues , official status for the Corsican language , and limiting the right to buy property in some areas to people who had lived on the island for at least five years .
`` This is a time many of us thought we would never witness , '' he told applauding supporters after the win , referring to the fact that nationalists only started to make headway in Corsican elections two years ago . `` Our dream is becoming reality . ''

Calling for discussions to find a `` political solution , '' Simeoni told Reuters : `` It 's the start of a new era , the ball is in the government 's court . ''
The nationalist vote also benefited from the island 's most active clandestine group , the National Front for the Liberation of Corsica ( FLNC ) , having laid down its weapons in 2014 after a near four-decade long rebellion .
Turnout for the run-off election , in which the top parties from an initial Dec. 3 ballot participated , was barely above 50 percent .
But in a sign that the government may be heeding the call for dialogue , Prime Minister Edouard Philippe on Sunday called Simeoni to congratulate him on his win and told him he was willing to see him soon in Paris , Philippe 's office said .
Corsica has a population of just 320,000 people and a tiny 8.6 billion euro ( US $ 10.13 billion ) economy .
( US $ 1 = 0.8488 euros )

SEVEN stars of Mid Wales rugby represented RGC in the inaugural Welsh Rugby Union ( WRU ) Women 's Super 5 event in Caerphilly last weekend .
The COBRA trio of Libby Jones , Grace Hill and Ffion Williams were joined by Welshpool 's Grace Johns and Rebecca Humphreys in the RGC senior squad .
Meanwhile Welshpool duo Sophie Licence-Law and Elis Tudor represented the North Wales region in the under 18s squad .
The competition pitted RGC against the women 's squads from Wales ' southern regions , the Ospreys , Blues , Dragons and Scarlets in the opening event of the 2017 regional programme .
The event saw shortened games contested geared at showcasing the regional talent .
Both RGC sides impressed on the day with the senior 's celebrating their best result in their history in a 5-0 win over Scarlets .
Welshpool 's Rebecca Humphreys scored a try in RGC 's 10-5 defeat against Ospreys while the senior squad drew 5-5 with the Dragons and 0-0 with the Blues .
The under 18s held the Ospreys to a 5-5 draw while 10-0 defeats to the Blues and Scarlets were followed by a 15-0 defeat to the Dragons .
Try scorer Humphreys , a leading player with the newly formed Welshpool club which competes in the Game On North Wales League , praised the RGC sides .
Humphreys said : ‚Äú It was a very rainy and muddy day , and both teams put in a huge effort and performed really well considering the length of time we 've both know each other and trained together . ‚Äù
They 're coming out of the woodwork .
A TV news anchor revealed her own creepy Harvey Weinstein ‚Äú casting couch ‚Äù story on Friday , following allegations that the movie mogul has been harassing women for years .
Lauren Sivan , who then worked for a local Long Island news station , told The Huffington Post that Weinstein cornered her in the hallway of a Manhattan restaurant about a decade ago and masturbated in front her .
She said that Weinstein lured her into the basement of a a Cuban bar and restaurant in Greenwich Village and tried to kiss her .
When she rebuffed the movie mogul , he simply began to pleasure himself .
‚Äú Well , can you just stand there and shut up , ‚Äù Weinstein allegedly said .
Meanwhile , a British actress claimed that she was denied a role when she refused to de-robe for the creepy Weinstein .
‚Äú I was offered a film role at 19 , Harvey Weinstein came on board and wanted me to screen-test in a bikini . I refused & lost the job , ‚Äù tweeted Jessica Hynes ( top ) , a Tony nominee who appeared in several ‚Äú Bridget Jones ‚Äù movies .
Actress Rose McGowan , who reportedly received a $ 100,000 payout after an incident with Weinstein , also took to Twitter after the accusations against the producer were revealed .
‚Äú Anyone who does business with __ is complicit . And deep down you know you are even dirtier . Cleanse yourselves , ‚Äù she wrote , presumably referring to Weinstein .

SINGAPORE : The Singapore Civil Defence Force was on Sunday night ( Aug 13 ) called to rescue a five-month-old child locked in a car parked at Tampines Street 23 .
In a nearly 11-minute video posted by eyewitness Fizah Jamal on Facebook , SCDF officers were seen examining the car before the father of the little boy came to unlock the vehicle and carry him out .
A woman can be heard chiding him for leaving the baby locked in the car , saying the child was `` screaming '' . `` How can you do that ? '' she asks him . `` I have a baby the same age . I have heard of so many cases of baby dying inside the car ( sic ) . You left the baby inside for 20 minutes , '' she says . `` We happened to pass by . How can you leave the baby like that ? ''
The video posted at 9.45pm on Sunday had been shared more than 1,100 times as of Monday evening .
SCDF said it received a call for assistance at 9pm at Block 201E Tampines Street 23 . It sent an ambulance , a fire bike and a Red Rhino to the scene .
After the father pulled out the child , paramedics were on scene to assess the child , who was unhurt .

SCDF added that no forcible entry into the vehicle was required .
Leaving children or pets unattended in cars is dangerous as the temperatures inside a car rises quickly and puts them at risk of suffocation or heatstroke .
Stanford 's big dual meet with the Cal men will take place on February 17th , 2018 , as two national juggernauts and bay area rivals will clash at what will be a home meet for the Cardinal .
That will cap off a busy second semester for Stanford , as they 'll square up against Pac-12 opponents USC , Arizona , and Arizona State prior to their Cal matchup . Stanford also has a meet scheduled with the University of the Pacific to kick off their second semester campaign .
In the fall , Stanford will host their alumni meet on October 13th , followed by a meet with Utah before getting into competition at the USA Swimming College Challenge . The Triple Distance meet at Cal will be on November 10th , and then the Cardinal will have their mid-season invite meet at the Texas Invite in Austin in late November/early December .
Stanford will be led by a mean distance group that includes Grant Shoults , Liam Egan , and True Sweetser , while World Champs qualifier Abrahm Devine is back , too . A big freshman class will complement a team that 's been gaining momentum of late , as Stanford looks to improve upon their 5th place NCAA finish last year .
Shania Twain is moving on from the sound created by her ex-husband and former producer Robert John 'Mutt ' Lange .
The country star , 51 , has not released a studio record since 2002 , a delay that in part is down to the turmoil in her professional and personal life caused by her break-up from her husband Robert John ‚Äò Mutt ' Lange , who doubled as the producer of all her albums .
The couple 's 2010 divorce came after Robert admitted an affair with Shania 's best friend Marie-Anne Thiebaud . Shania ended up getting close with Marie-Anne 's betrayed husband Frederic Thiebaud , and the pair wed in 2011 .
She is planning to release a new album this spring , and says she told those working on her record , including One Direction producer Jake Gosling and Bruce Springsteen collaborator Ron Aniello , to erase all her previous work from their minds .
‚Äú I told anyone getting involved musically to forget about my other records , ‚Äù the musician tells Rolling Stone . ‚Äú I did n't want it to be related to Mutt 's productions at all . I wanted a more organic approach . ‚Äù
When Robert was her producer Shania sold 85 million records and became country music 's biggest pop crossover star , but she now wants to move away from her pop roots .
‚Äú Most of them started off quite melancholy and a lot darker , ‚Äù she explains of her new songs .
However she 's philosophical about how her split from the man she shared her life and music with has affected her .
‚Äú I 'm a different singer now , ‚Äù she shares . ‚Äú There was a lot of coming to terms with that . It 's been one of the obstacles in my life I 've just had to learn to live with . ‚Äù
The country veteran 's new album is yet to receive an official title , but tracks include Swinging With My Eyes Closed , and Who 's Gon na Be Your Girl ? , a ballad about the breakdown of her marriage .
Italian Olympic champion Gregorio Paltrinieri will be changing things up this season , joining Mack Horton for 6 months of training in Australia . Paltrinieri , the Olympic 1500 free champ , and Australia 's Horton , the Olympic 400 free champ , should make great training partners as they 're 2 of the top distance freestylers in the world . He 's been considering making this trip to train with Horton since the two spent vacation time in Italy following the 2016 Rio Olympics .
Paltrinieri plans to spend 6 months training with Horton , but will fly back to Europe to take part in the 2017 European Short Course Swimming Championships . The meet will take place at the Royal Arena in Copenhagen , Denmark from December 13th-17th . He 'll then fly back to Melbourne , where he will likely spend the Christmas holidays , to resume training with Horton . During this 6 months , Paltrinieri hopes to find new challenges in the lead up to the Tokyo 2020 Olympics .
Paltrinieri is coming off a 2017 FINA World Championships in which he won the 1500 free title . He was also the bronze medalist in the 800 free . Horton , on the other hand , was the World 's silver medalist in the 400 free and the bronze medalist in the 1500 free .
Five Yorkshire clubs were in action in Super League on Easter Monday . Here 's a round-up .
Wakefield Trinity 10 Wigan 16
A late try from in-form rookie winger Liam Marshall enabled Wigan to erase the memory of their humiliating 62-0 rout as they ground out a 16-10 victory over tenacious Wakefield at the Beaumont Legal Stadium .
The Warriors were never behind but they led only 12-10 at half-time and needed a ninth try in his seven appearance from Marshall to finally see off Chris Chester 's men and complete another Easter clean sweep .
It was certainly a far cry from the embarrassment of their previous visit to Belle Vue , when they were without 10 senior players through injury and illness , but Trinity fans still gave their players a standing ovation at the end .
Leigh 10 Hull FC 24
Leigh suffered their fifth consecutive Betfred Super League defeat at the hands of a Hull FC side who had lost their previous two .
Inspired by half-backs Albery Kelly and Marc Sneyd , Hull scored three tries in quick succession during a devastating 11-minute first-half spell to take a grip on the game .
Centre Carlos Tuimavave scored twice as Hull FC produced the perfect response after conceding more than 50 points in their last two games against Salford Red Devils and Leeds Rhinos .
Leading 18-0 after half an hour , Hull rarely looked in danger against a Leigh side ravaged by injuries .
Leeds Rhinos 42 Widnes 22
Kallum Watkins scored 22 points with two tries and seven goals but Leeds were forced to withstand a fierce second-half fightback to complete a perfect Easter with a 42-22 victory over struggling Widnes .
The Rhinos , who won 52-24 at Hull on Good Friday , ran in five first-half tries to lead 30-6 at the break but three unanswered scores from the Vikings set up a tense finale .
Leeds ' sixth win in their last seven games ensured that they stay hard on the heels of Betfred Super League leaders Castleford , albeit the Tigers have a game in hand .
Widnes , still with just one win in their first 10 games , remain rooted to the foot of the table .
St Helens 26 Castleford Tigers 22
St Helens produced a stunning performance to pull off a well deserved 26-22 victory over Super League leaders Castleford .
Saints delivered a fine first-half display before holding off a spirited Tigers fightback to hand stand-in boss Jamahl Lolesi his first win since Keiron Cunningham 's departure .
Matty Fleming , Luke Douglas and Mark Percival all crossed as the hosts took a 20-8 lead into the interval , while Regan Grace 's try with 12 minutes left proved decisive .
Greg Eden and Ben Roberts both touched down twice for Castleford , who suffered only their second defeat of the campaign .
Warrington Wolves 26 Huddersfield Giants 24
Warrington 's Super League revival continued as they claimed their third successive win after hanging on for a dramatic hard-fought victory over Huddersfield Giants .
The resurgent Wolves are unbeaten in their last four games now and moved out of the bottom two of Super League and leapfrogged the Giants as a result of the 26-24 success .
Warrington trailed 20-16 on the hour at the Halliwell Jones Stadium but two tries in three minutes from Rhys Evans and Toby King looked to have settled a tense encounter .
In a dramatic finale , Giants winger Jermaine McGillvary crossed in the corner as the hooter sounded - but Danny Brough was inches wide with his touchline conversion attempt in a bid to claim a draw .
MIAMI COUNTY ‚Äî A Troy man plead guilty to several drug related charges in Miami County Common Pleas Court on Wednesday .
Jah Batdorf , 24 , waived his rights to a grand jury and pleaded guilty to a bill of information charging him with attempted weapons possession under disability , drug trafficking of Xanax , drug possession ‚Äî all fourth degree felonies . Batdorf was also charged with first degree misdemeanor OVI , his second offense in less than 10 years .
In a plea agreement with the state , charges were amended down from third-degree offenses . Batdorf also agreed to forfeit a Smith and Wesson gun and $ 1,623 in cash recovered at the time of his arrest .
Judge Christopher Gee noted the drug possession and drug trafficking charges will merge upon sentencing . Batdorf could be sentenced up to three years in prison and a one to seven year license suspension and other restrictions .
Judge Gee ordered Batdorf to complete a drug and alcohol assessment at the Miami County Recovery Council and observe a curfew as part of his special bond conditions . He also ordered Batdorf not to appear in court in cargo shorts at his next hearing . Batdorf will be sentenced on July 17 .
On Feb. 27 , Troy Police Department officers arrested Batdorf who was passed out in the driver 's seat of a vehicle in the 100 block of Franklin Street around 1:45 a.m. Batdorf allegedly was difficult to wake up and the keys were in the ignition of the vehicle .
Officers conducted a search of the vehicle and found a handgun , pills and other drug paraphernalia .
Batdorf was also recently cited for minor misdemeanor disorderly conduct after he was found laying on the ground in the area of the East Main Street bridge in Piqua on May 26 .
In other court news :
On Wednesday , Jacob Miller , 26 , of Troy , entered a plea of guilty to fourth-degree felony aggravated assault in Miami County Common Pleas Court .
In a joint agreement , the state dismissed a felony burglary charge in exchange for Miller 's guilty plea . Miller waived his right to a grand jury and entered the plea through bill of information .
Miller could face up to 18 months in prison for the incident .
Judge Gee ordered Miller to complete a pre-sentence investigation , observe a curfew , and have no contact with the victim . He also was ordered to not appear in court wearing shorts at his sentencing hearing on July 17 .
On April 4 , Miller confronted a male subject with a metal pipe , breaking glass doors at the victim 's home on Simpson Street , Troy . Miller struck the victim several times , including a hit on the arm as he shielded his head from a potential blow . The incident was sparked over an argument over a female subject who was present at the time of the incident .

Any experienced technology educator knows engagement and motivation are key to a student 's learning . Of the many techniques for stimulating engagement and motivation among learners , storytelling and game creation have good track records of success , and writing interactive fiction is a great way to combine both of those techniques .
Interactive fiction has a respectable history in computing , stretching back to the text-only adventure games of the early 1980s , and it 's enjoyed a new popularity recently . There are many technology tools that can be used for writing interactive fiction , but the two that will be considered here , Twine and Ren'Py , are ideal for the task . Each has different strengths that make it more attractive for particular types of projects .
Twine
twine2.png
Twine is a popular cross-platform open source interactive fiction system that developed out of the HTML- and JavaScript-based TiddlyWiki . If you 're not familiar with Twine , multimedia artist and Opensource.com contributor Seth Kenlon 's article on how he uses Twine to create interactive adventure games is a great introduction to the tool .
One of Twine 's advantages is that it produces a single , compiled HTML file , which makes it easy to distribute and play an interactive fiction work on any system with a reasonably modern web browser . But this comes at a cost : While it will support graphics , sound files , and embedded video , Twine is somewhat limited by its roots as a primarily text-based system ( even though it has developed a lot over the years ) .
This is very appealing to new learners who can rapidly produce something that looks good and is fun to play . However , when they want to add visual effects , graphics , and multimedia , learners can get lost among the different , creative ways to do this and the maze of different Twine program versions and story formats . Even so , there 's an impressive amount of resources available on how to use Twine .
Educators often hope learners will take the skills they have gained using one tool and build on them , but this is n't a strength for Twine . While Twine is great for developing literacy and creative writing skills , the coding and programming side is weaker . The story format scripting language has what you would expect : logic commands , conditional statements , arrays/lists , and loops , but it is not closely related to any popular programming language .
Ren'Py
renpy.png
Ren'Py approaches interactive fiction from a different angle ; Wikipedia describes it as a `` visual novel engine . '' This means that the integration of graphics and other multimedia elements is a lot smoother and more integrated than in Twine . In addition , as Opensource.com contributor Joshua Allen Holm explained , you do n't need much coding experience to use Ren'Py .
Ren'Py can export finished work for Android , Linux , Mac , and Windows , which is messier than the `` one file for all systems '' that comes from Twine , particularly if you get into the complexity of making builds for mobile devices . Bear in mind , too , that finished Ren'Py projects with their multimedia elements are a lot bigger than Twine projects .
The ease of downloading graphics and multimedia files from the internet for Ren'Py projects also provides a great opportunity to teach learners about the complexities of copyright and advocate ( as everyone should ! ) for Creative Commons licenses .
As its name suggests , Ren'Py 's scripting languages are a mix of true Python and Python-like additions . This will be very attractive to educators who want learners to progress to Python programming . Python 's syntatical rules and strict enforcement of indentation are more intimidating to use than the scripting options in Twine , but the long-term gains are worth it .
Comparing Twine and Ren'Py
There are various reasons why Twine has become so successful , but one that will appeal to open source enthusiasts is that anyone can take a compiled Twine story or game and import it back into Twine . This means if you come across a compiled Twine story or game with a neat feature , you can look at the source code and find out how it was done . Ren'Py allows a level of obfuscation that prevents low-level attempts at hacking .
When it comes to my work helping people with visual impairments use technology , Ren'Py is superior to Twine . Despite claims to the contrary , Twine 's HTML files can be used by screen reader users‚Äîbut only with difficulty . In contrast , Ren'Py has built-in self-voicing capabilities , something that I am very pleased to see , although Linux users may need to add the eSpeak package to support it .
Ren'Py and Twine can be used for similar purposes . Text-based projects tend to be simpler and quicker to create than ones that require creating or sourcing graphics and multimedia elements . If your projects will be more text-based , Twine might be the best choice . And , if your projects make extensive use of graphics and multimedia elements , Ren'Py might suit you better .
Watford manager Walter Mazzarri has dismissed uncertainty surrounding his future by claiming the Hornets are on course to avoid relegation in a harder Premier League than last year .
The 4-1 defeat to Tottenham on New Year 's Day saw Watford slip to 13th in the table , having won only once in seven games .
Dele Alli and Harry Kane each scored twice for Spurs at Vicarage Road before Younes Kaboul added a late consolation , but in the truth the scoreline flattered Watford , who were outplayed from start to finish .
Mazzarri 's cause has not been helped by a number of injuries to key players , not the least Camilo Zuniga , who felt pain in his ankle during the warm-up against Tottenham and had to be replaced at the last minute by Odion Ighalo .
Watford also sit eight points clear of the relegation zone but some of the club 's fans greeted their latest loss with boos , having grown frustrated with recent performances .
`` From the first day I arrived I spoke with the club and the president , '' Mazzarri said .
`` When we have spoken about the first objective , which has always been the same , it was to avoid relegation . In this moment if we look at the table we are doing even better than the starting objective .
`` We could have been where Crystal Palace are or other teams are but we are n't . This has always been the first objective and we 're doing okay . ''
Watford were ninth with 29 points at this stage last season under Quique Sanchez Flores , who was sacked by the club 's owners in the summer .
Mazzarri 's team are four places worse off with seven points fewer but the Italian insists comparisons with his predecessor are unfair .
`` What happened last year , I 'm really not interested , '' Mazzarri said .
`` Last year I know in the first half Watford did very good and then in the second they started to lose some points . If we look at this year we 're still online with our objective which is to stay in the Premier League .
`` Then if we really want to compare the Premier League this year to last it 's much better than it was last season .
`` If we look at who won the Premier League last year it was a team that was managed very well by ( Claudio ) Ranieri but is a team this year fighting not to be relegated .
`` That says a lot and we can not really compare the Premier League this year with the one last year . ''
Tottenham 's victory puts them 10 points behind league leaders Chelsea ahead of the teams ' crunch meeting on Wednesday .
Chelsea will be chasing a record-breaking 14th consecutive Premier League win and Mauricio Pochettino believes neutrals will be cheering his side on at White Hart Lane .
`` Maybe we will feel how Leicester feel last season , when all the teams were with them and against us . Maybe now we are Leicester , '' Pochettino said .
`` Chelsea arrives in very good shape - us too after the last few games .
`` It will be a very tough game and a great opportunity for us to try to stop them and try to reduce the gap .
`` It 's important , I think it 's important for us and for the Premier League to try to win and try to stop them and reduce the gap . ''
RIYADH - Turkey 's President Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan met Saudi Arabia 's top leadership on Tuesday during a visit to further strengthen ties as part of a Gulf tour ahead of Syria peace talks .
King Salman hosted a luncheon banquet for Erdoƒüan , who arrived in Riyadh late Monday , the official Saudi Press Agency said .
It gave no details of their discussions , but said Erdoƒüan also met Crown Prince Mohammed bin Nayef , the interior minister , and Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman , who is defence minister . The two Sunni powers have become increasingly close over the past year , sharing in particular a backing for the opposition in Syria 's war .
As Erdoƒüan held talks in Riyadh , his Prime Minister Binali Yildirim told his ruling Justice and Development Party lawmakers in Ankara that Al-Bab in northern Syria was `` largely '' under the control of Turkish-backed Syrian rebels after months of clashes with militants .
Al-Bab was the Islamic State group 's last stronghold in Aleppo province .
Ankara has taken on an increasingly important role with Moscow and Iran as a powerbroker in the Syria conflict .
Syria militant infighting kills nearly 70
Nearly 70 fighters from two formerly allied militant groups have been killed during infighting over the past 24 hours in northern Syria , a monitor said on Tuesday .
The clashes between former Al-Qaeda affiliate Fateh al-Sham and the hardline militant Jund al-Aqsa faction erupted on Monday morning , after tensions over influence in the northwestern province of Idlib . The fighting reflects the growing strained relations between different factions in Idlib province that once fought alongside either other against President Bashar al-Assad 's forces .
The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the clashes erupted after Jund al-Aqsa carried out a suicide bomb attack against a Fateh al-Sham headquarters in Idlib , killing nine people .
The toll has now risen to 69 dead from both sides in heavy clashes and executions , with the fighting spreading to the neighbouring province of Hama .
`` There are battles between warlords , it 's a war for influence , '' said Observatory director Rami Abdel Rahman .
Jund al-Aqsa is reviled by most rebels in the region , and is designed a `` terrorist group '' by Washington .
Despite that , in October Fateh al-Sham announced it had taken Jund al-Aqsa under its wing , although clashes between the two groups erupted shortly afterwards .
In January , Fateh al-Sham also battled other rebel groups in Idlib during 10 days of clashes that killed dozens of fighters .
Idlib province is held almost entirely by opposition factions , and was captured by an alliance of fighters dubbed the Army of Conquest , led by Fateh al-Sham .
More than 310,000 people have been killed in Syria since the conflict began in March 2011 with anti-government protests .
The war has become a complex multi-front conflict , drawing in militant groups and international armies .

REUTERS : Charly Musonda has returned to Chelsea early from his loan spell with Real Betis , the Spanish club said on Monday .
Belgium under-21 international Musonda initially moved to Betis in January 2016 , and the attacking midfielder extended his stay after impressing during the second half of last season .
However , he has made just one La Liga start and eight substitute appearances so far this term .
`` Real Betis and Chelsea FC have reached an agreement to terminate the loan of player Charly Musonda Jr to the Green-and-White team , '' read a statement on Betis 's official website . ( www.realbetisbalompie.es )
Musonda will get a chance to establish himself at Chelsea after manager Antonio Conte said he would take a look at him and another 20-year-old returning loanee , Brazilian winger Kenedy .
`` Kenedy and Musonda went back from their loan because they did n't play a lot , '' Conte told reporters on Friday . `` I think it 's important to stay with us in these weeks to evaluate the best situation for them and for the team . ''
Chelsea 's attacking options have been reduced following midfielder Oscar 's move to Shanghai SIPG , and Conte has indicated that he would prefer to improve his squad using players on the club 's books rather than new signings .
`` Musonda , Kenedy , you are talking with a player of 20 , 21 years , '' the Italian added . `` It 's important to find a right solution at home , then , if it 's not possible , you have to look around to find a new solution . ''

Police in the Iranian capital , Tehran , have arrested 29 people for their involvement in protests against the country 's compulsory headscarf law .
Women across Iran have been removing their headscarves in public to protest Iran 's strict Islamic dress code . Videos and photos shared on social media have shown demonstrators standing on utility boxes on street sidewalks , defiantly waving their hijabs .
Tehran police suggested that their actions were incited by foreigners , saying those arrested were ‚Äú deceived ‚Äù into removing their hijabs , Iran 's semiofficial Tasnim News Agency reported . The 29 protesters been transferred to judicial authorities , the report said .
Masih Alinejad , the Iranian activist behind the ‚Äú White Wednesday ‚Äù social media campaign against mandatory hijabs , who is now based in the US , told CNN that the movement has not been influenced from abroad .
‚Äú The movement started inside Iran . It has nothing to do with forces outside of Iran , ‚Äù Alinejad said .
‚Äú This is a campaign that 's been going on for years and years . The women of Iran have long been ignored . We 're just giving them a platform. ‚Äù News of the arrests came just days after the release of Vida Mohaved , a woman who was detained in December after removing her headscarf at an anti-regime protest . The wave of anti-goverment demonstrations last month was sparked by concerns over rising living costs and a stagnant economy , but also provided an opening for Iranian women to push for equal rights . Women have been required to wear the hijab since he is Islamic Revolution in 1979 . Mohaved attracted attention during the demonstrations when a video of her protesting went viral . The footage shows Mohaved waving her white hijab defiantly from the end of a pole , her black hair flowing uncovered . In recent months , enforcement of the law banning the hijab has been relaxed . In the past , women who allowed their hijab to slip could be admonished by the religious police , but these forces have been less prominent under the regime of President Hassan Rouhani . Authorities also announced that women driving with improper head coverings would no longer be arrested , and instead receive a relatively small fine . The easing of the enforcement has emboldened younger women to become more defiant , but recent incidents in which they have removed their hijabs in protest could still lead to prison sentences . Soheila Jaloodarzadeh , a female member of the Iranian Parliament , said on Wednesday during an event on women 's rights that the protests were the conclusion of years of restrictions , the semiofficial Ilna news agency reported . ‚Äú When we restrict women , and put them under unnecessary pressure , exactly this is the reason for rebellions , ‚Äù Jaloodarzadeh said , according to Ilna . ‚Äú This is the reason‚Ä¶ the daughters of Revolution Street are putting their headscarves on a stick . ‚Äù

Five things to watch this week in Canadian business :
> Ontario cap-and-trade
Ontarians should immediately start feeling the effects of the Liberal government 's ambitious cap-and-trade program , which came into effect Jan. 1 . The plan , which is aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions to 15 % below 1990 levels within four years , will drive the price of gasoline up 4.3¬¢ per litre and increase the cost of home heating by up to $ 6.70 a month .
> Drywall duty ruling
The Canadian International Trade Tribunal is scheduled to rule Wednesday on whether imports of drywall or gypsum board from the U.S. have injured or threaten to injure the western Canadian industry , with reasons for the decision to follow 15 days later . If the answer is yes , preliminary duties of up to 276 % that began in September on U.S. drywall imported into Canada for use in B.C. , Alberta , Saskatchewan , Manitoba and the Yukon and Northwest Territories could be made permanent .
> Foreign relations
International Trade Minister Chrystia Freeland will be in Montreal on Thursday to give a speech about how small- and medium-sized enterprises may benefit from the Canada-EU Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement ( CETA ) . She will also discuss the federal government 's aim to increase international investment .
> Trade and labour reports
On Friday , Statistics Canada releases the Canadian international merchandise trade for November and the labour force survey for December .
> Earnings
Also on Friday , Quebec-based drug store chain Jean Coutu Group ( TSX : PJC.A ) releases its third-quarter results prior to markets open , followed by a conference call at 9 a.m. Analysts expect to learn more about two Quebec laws that affect the supply of drugs in the province , including plans to introduce a tendering system for the purchase of some medications .
Face , Iris and Pulse Sensors on the Fast Track For The Next Steps Biometrics Security
May 2018 by ABI Research
The battle for the future of biometric modalities in consumer electronics is expected to become fiercer with each passing year as face and iris recognition are continuously gaining strength , threating to soon cannibalize on fingerprint technologies . ABI Research , a market-foresight advisory firm providing strategic guidance on the most compelling transformative technologies , posits that as ASPs for iris modules drop , and the once timid face recognition is continuously honed with more sophisticated machine learning algorithms , they will both slowly start to eat away at fingerprint implementations .
Apple 's choice to forego fingerprints and focus on face recognition for the iPhone X and Samsung 's choice to focus on iris recognition for the Galaxy S8 and S9 have fast-tracked this realization . However , fingerprint technologies wo n't go down without a fight as multiple innovative vendors including FPC , Qualcomm , Synaptics and Goodix introduce more robust , spoof-resistant sensors and a brand new ‚Äú poster-boy ‚Äù for fingerprints : the invisible , under-display sensor .
‚Äú Even though fingerprint sensor ASPs have taken a significant hit over the last couple of years , total fingerprint sensor shipments for the entire consumer market is still estimated to reach 1.2 billion worldwide for 2018 , thus ensuring its market dominance , ‚Äù comments Dimitrios Pavlakis , Industry Analyst for ABI Research .
‚Äú However , from established markets such as banking and payments to emerging ones like automotive and future-looking ones including robotics , we expect to see an increase in multi-modal applications and a scenario where biometrics is a critical component of a user 's digital ID in the emerging IoT ecosystem. ‚Äù With the rise of card-less biometric ATMs developed by Diebold Nixdorf and Samsung , automotive investments by major car OEMs like GM , Nissan , BMW and Volvo , and governmental mandates in APAC seeking to expand biometrics further into banking , consumer , and telecoms , the single-modality pattern will shift radically .
‚Äú Multimodal user authentication in the Internet of Things will not be another gimmicky option ‚Äì it will be the security norm , ‚Äù concludes Pavlakis . Established vendors are advised to plan accordingly and expand their biometric portfolio depending on the choice of market vertical .
These findings are from ABI Research 's Biometric Technologies and Applications report . This report is part of the company 's Digital Security research service , which includes research , data , and Executive Foresights .
LAS VEGAS ‚Äì Evgeny Kuznetzov grabbed his arm or his shoulder and maybe , while he was helping himself off the ice , he grabbed his Washington Capitals teammates and gave them a little shake .
They needed it .
When the Capitals No . 1 centre left Game 2 of the Stanley Cup final with just over five minutes to play in the first period ‚Äî and his absence will certainly become more of a story assuming disclosure of his injury ‚Äî it was almost as though Washington came to life , returning to the kind of physical , engaged form they needed to win the Eastern Conference .
The more they missed Kuznetzov , who leads the playoffs in scoring , the more they got from third line centre , Lars Eller , the more they got from an entire lineup , which decided to push back against the surprising Vegas Golden Knights .
The injury aside , it was role reversal from Game 1 here at the T-Mobile Arena .
In Game 1 , a much-discussed hit on Jonathan Marchessault by big Tom Wilson appeared to tilt the game in favour of Vegas . Marchessault did return to play . Kuznetzov was n't so fortunate .
The Caps led 3-2 after two periods . The Knights had not lost a playoff game in regulation in three previous rounds .
Washington ca n't afford to have Kuznetzov off long but the emotional lift was noticeable in Game 2 . Kuznetzov centres the big line with Alexander Ovechkin , has emerged as big-time playoff performer and is enormous on the Caps impressive power play .
PUCK NOTES
Eller scored his sixth goal of this playoff season Wednesday night , which equalled his total in 50 post-season games with St. Louis and Montreal prior to this year . Eller was expected to be a free agent come July but he did the hockey thing and re-signed with the Caps in the winter . He was in on two of Washington 's first three goals in Game 2 and has proven to be a valuable and versatile third-line centre who can move up in the lineup , if necessary ‚Ä¶ Hello Ovie : And welcome to the Stanley Cup final . Ovechkin , so brilliant in Game 6 and 7 against Tampa Bay in the Eastern Conference final , scored his first goal of his first Cup final from his office , on the power play in the second period . Ovechkin did show a side of his leadership in the previous round , especially in Game 6 , when he was the best player on the ice and did n't have to score to prove that ‚Ä¶ This will get talked about today , no doubt . Big guy Ryan Reaves cross-checked big guy Tom Wilson in the face and bloodied the Washington forward in the second period . Oddly , he was penalized for roughing . It could have easily been a four-minute call ‚Ä¶ T.J. Oshie , a very skilled forward , occasionally takes somewhat mindless penalties . He took one late in the second period and Shea Theodore scored on a screen shot , beating Braden Holtby , who never saw the shot coming ‚Ä¶ When the home team wins the first two games of a series , they have won 92.3 % of the time in previous finals . The last team to win the first two games and not win the Cup , the 2011 Vancouver Canucks ‚Ä¶ What a delight is to watch Marc-Andre Fleury play goal . He is not a robotic butterfly goaltender . He is more old-school , hybrid style , very athletic , and fun to watch a goaltender so engaged in the game .
HEAR AND THERE
Game 1 of the final was just the third game in NHL playoff history to see four lead changes . The two previous games were not in the Cup final ‚Ä¶ Fleury is the first goalie since Dominik Hasek ( Buffalo , Detroit ) to represent two different teams in a final series ‚Ä¶ The last time a first-year team won a major championship ‚Äî the 1950 Cleveland Browns won the NFL title long before there were Super Bowls ‚Ä¶ There has been a lot of concern about the quality of ice at T-Mobile , especially after a difficult night in Game 1 . ‚Äú There is n't anything we can do about it , ‚Äù said Oshie of the Capitals . ‚Äú We 're playing on the same ice , if it 's bad for them , it 's bad for us. ‚Äù Oshie does think that less than ideal ice hurts the Capitals more than it hurts the Golden Knights . The reason . ‚Äú We have more skill players. ‚Äù Said Coach Barry Trotz on the reality of ice difficulty : ‚Äú Let 's face it , it 's 100 degrees out , there are 20,000 people in the arena making all kinds of noise . With that , we knew ice would be problematic. ‚Äù ‚Ä¶ Bad ice or not , Trotz did n't like the way his team played in Game 1 and frankly , did n't like the way the Golden Knights played . ‚Äú That game was n't a true reflection on both teams , ‚Äù said Trotz . ‚Äú It was a bit of a scramble with lots of chaos. ‚Äù ‚Ä¶ The Las Vegas band , Imagine Dragons , who were halftime entertainment at the 2014 Grey Cup , played a pre-game in-arena concert Wednesday night . Like just about everything Vegas seems to do pre-game , it was impressive ‚Ä¶ For as great as this Vegas story has been , it has n't caught everyone 's attention . The NHL has to be disappointed that there is no media coverage here from Boston , Chicago , Dallas , St. Louis , Minnesota , Florida , Tampa Bay , Nashville , Colorado , Carolina , San Jose , Pittsburgh , Philadelphia , Columbus , Arizona , New Jersey ‚Äî more than half of the leagues ' cities .

China will `` absolutely not '' fire the first shot in a trade war with the United States and will not be the first to levy tariffs , its finance ministry said on Wednesday .
BEIJING : China will `` absolutely not '' fire the first shot in a trade war with the United States and will not be the first to levy tariffs , its finance ministry said on Wednesday .
A person with knowledge of the plan earlier told Reuters China 's threatened tariffs on US $ 34 billion of U.S. goods would take effect from the beginning of the day on Friday . Given the 12-hour time difference , that would have put its implementation ahead of Washington 's . Other media carried similar reports .

But the ministry issued a brief clarification in response .
`` The Chinese government 's position has been stated many times . We absolutely will not fire the first shot , and will not implement tariff measures ahead of the United States doing so , '' it said , without elaborating .
Washington has said it would implement tariffs on US $ 34 billion of Chinese imports on July 6 , and Beijing has vowed to retaliate in kind on the same day .
Earlier , Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said China was ready to act , though he did not confirm the start date for Chinese tariffs .

`` China has already made preparations , '' Lu told a daily news briefing .
`` As long as the United States issues a so-called tariff list , China will take necessary measures to firmly protect its legitimate interests , '' he added , without elaborating .
China 's yuan rose sharply against the dollar on Wednesday , a day after the central bank assured markets it would keep the currency stable amid growing worries about trade friction , although stocks fell .
Chinese state media on Wednesday kept up a steady drum beat of criticism of the United States .

The official China Daily said the United States was intentionally trying to prevent China from developing to keep it from challenging the former 's role in the global economic order .
`` The U.S. has maintained hegemony in the military and financial fields for many decades . Now it is pursuing economic hegemony , '' the English-language newspaper said in an editorial .
`` It has frequently waged wars against other sovereign countries and made use of the dominant influence of the U.S. dollar in the international markets to fleece other countries . Now it is attempting to resort to an all-out trade and economic war to hold back China 's normal development . ''
Widely-read tabloid the Global Times , published by the ruling Communist Party 's People 's Daily , said the increasingly likely trade war would bring chaos to the world .
`` Counterstrike is major economies ' first reaction to Washington 's trade war , '' it said in its editorial .
`` It 's hard to predict where these moves will lead the world , but Washington will unavoidably pay heavy prices for its attempts to change the whole world to its economic tributary . ''
U.S. President Donald Trump has threatened to escalate the trade conflict with tariffs on as much as US $ 400 billion in Chinese goods if Beijing retaliates against the U.S. tariffs set to take effect on Friday .
Chinese currency and stock markets have been jittery ahead of Friday 's tariff implementation .

An industry colleague from Travel Corporation Canada , recently reminded me that July 7 is World Chocolate Day .
That made me wonder ‚Ä¶ what does one do on World Chocolate Day ? Turns out eating chocolate is the main way to celebrate .
For its part , the Travel Corporation likes to celebrate destinations famous for producing and indulging in chocolate .
Their picks range from chocolate producers such as Ecuador ‚Äî famous for its top quality cocoa beans and chocolate bars ‚Äî to Australia 's Hunter Valley , an emerging producer .
Among their picks for places to indulge in chocolate :
* Switzerland , a major manufacturer and the country with the highest per capita chocolate consumption . ( On a visit to Zurich a few years ago I could n't help but notice the massive amount and variety of chocolate sold in Swiss grocery stores and airports . )
* Bariloche , Argentina , the so-called ‚Äú Switzerland of South America. ‚Äù Bariloche is home to the Avenue of Chocolate Dreams , a street lined with chocolate shops and museums .
And if you 're thinking perhaps it 's a little too hot right now for anything but chocolate ice cream , do n't despair , there are several additional days to celebrate chocolate throughout the world : Bittersweet Chocolate Day ( Jan. 10 ) , Milk Chocolate Day ( July 28 ) , International Chocolate Day ( Sept. 13 ) , White Chocolate Day ( Sept. 22 ) , and Chocolate Covered Anything Day ( Dec. 16 ) as well as two National Chocolate Days in the U.S. ( Oct. 28 and Dec. 28 ) . Bon app√©tit .
PAMPERED PETS
Travelling with pets has steadily increased in popularity in the past 15 years . So I was n't surprised when a Sun colleague told me recently that she and her wife are planning a road trip to Prince Edward Island with their three dachshunds .
I frequently get press releases about hotels that cater to both human and canine guests . But one from The Pines Lodge in Beaver Creek , Colorado , really grabbed my attention .
The resort has a new Pines Pup Bucket List package that it calls the ‚Äú ultimate pup-cation. ‚Äù And it really is .
Here is a sample of what dog-lovers and their furry friends can expect from the package :
* Hiking in the mountains surrounding the lodge is a popular pastime . Pup-parents will receive maps with the top dog-friendly hiking routes , and a chance to check out GoPros to record their mountain treks .
* The lodge is close to many pet-friendly restaurants , where doggies can enjoy ‚Äú yappy hour . ‚Äù
* Dog spa treatments are included , complete with doggie massages , a bath and blow-out .
* A ‚Äú pupdown ‚Äù pillow service provides a nightly rawhide bone at turndown , along with a plush doggie bed and leash to use during the visit .
* Food , water bowls and a mat for in-room doggie dining , plus a curated doggie menu .
* Toys and bandanas .
* Canine guests can leave their pawprint in the doggie guest book , equipped with a Polaroid camera to capture the fur-filled memories .
ONLY IN QUEBEC

Day 2 : A Magical Phone
Adrian : Hold things close to you and decide if you feel joy . The magic of tidying up digital . The life-changing magic of tidying up by Marie Kondo was a revelation to me . The sensation of touch is actually important and the makers of smart phones know this . Actually taking the step to delete apps I do n't use and organise all the ones I do onto one screen was mildly terrifying at first , but now a week later I am still heartened by my digital uncluttering .
This , coupled with turning off notifications on my phone , has helped give me peace on the way home from work . This exercise turned me into a digital Kondo afficiando .
I found this so satisfying . A clean phone makes me feel joyful . My gadget sparked joy for me today and I do n't feel like it was ruling me , I was taking charge # digitalgoals .
via GIPHY
Lisa : Tidying my phone Apps into folders and turning off notifications was scary for me . I put up a great fight not to do it . I mean what if I missed a fabulous piece of breaking news like ‚Äò the president is mad and unstable ' . I put off the task until towards the end of the day when I got ‚Äò app declutter envy ' on seeing the radiant joy emanating from my work colleagues who had successfully completed this task .
When I did it I loved having control over the look of my phone as the apps wobbled and I popped them all the apps into various folders . Until the next day when I could n't find where I had put the weather . Too bad take a look outside I noted to self , ‚Äò it 's not the end of the world ' as I merrily went on my commute to work in my bubble bliss of rising joy .
Rana : I was really looking forward to this task . After deleting apps that I hardly use and putting the rest in a folder , I felt calmer just seeing the empty home screen ! Just reducing the visual clutter made a difference .
I then turned off notifications from all the messaging apps ‚Äì and this I found fantastic as I was n't seeing the many messages coming through from the various groups I 'm in , and I could check them whenever I wanted to . I felt more in control of the device , and in general felt more free somehow . It felt great and I wondered why I had n't done this before .
Melissa : I loved , loved this challenge . It was freeing to see a clear home screen no apps no obligations and no notifications . I was free .
Although I still needed to monitor our social channels on my desktop ( that is my job ) at least on my phone was buzz free . And when I did have to do a task on the phone , the task was calculated and purposeful . I did n't get distracted by the multitude of other apps that I needed to check just in case I missed a news item or source .
I think I 'll keep it like this for a while . The picture I chose was also calming and somewhat magical .

Environment Secretary Roseanna Cunningham was in Oban last week to announce a research programme to monitor the common skate .
Skate populations have declined by over 90 per cent over the past 100 years due to over fishing .
The Scottish Government have committed ¬£390,000 to a three year research programme , to be led by the University of St Andrews , in collaboration with Scottish Government and Scottish Natural Heritage , which should underpin the long term conservation effort which is required to allow the skate population recover .
In its fourth interest rate announcement of 2018 , the Bank of Canada ( BoC ) said on Wednesday it will maintain its benchmark rate steady at 1.25 per cent .
The central bank noted that the Canadian economy was a little stronger than expected in the first three months of the year , thanks in part to exports of goods that have been more robust than forecast . Data on imports of machinery and equipment have also suggested a continued recovery in investment .

However , the BoC also noted that housing resale activity has remained soft as the market adjusts to new mortgage rules and higher interest rates . On the other hand , solid labour income growth supports the expectation that activity will pick up , the bank added .
The BoC said global economic activity remains broadly on track but added that ongoing uncertainty about trade policies is dampening global business investment , while stresses are developing in some emerging market economies .

The bank said that recent developments have reinforced its view that higher interest rates will be warranted to keep inflation near its target , but that it will take a gradual approach and be guided by the economic data .
Dwight Gayle says he 's only got one hope for 2017 ‚Äì promotion for Newcastle United .
The striker took his goal tally for the season to 19 with two goals in last week 's 3-1 win over Nottingham Forest .
I perhaps get a bit frustrated because I maybe do n't get to touch the ball as much as I want .
United 's victory took the club back to the top of the Championship ahead of this afternoon 's game against Blackburn Rovers .
Gayle , set to become the first Newcastle player since Alan Shearer to reach the 20-goal mark , is looking to add to his tally at Ewood Park , where the club will be backed by almost 7,000 fans .
The 26-year-old , signed from Crystal Palace last summer , says his goalscoring owes everything to his team-mates .
Gayle said : ‚Äú It 's really nice to get the goals .
‚Äú This is what I love doing and after each goal it 's just a fantastic feeling .
‚Äú Obviously , I need to pay a lot of credit to the team , though , and what they 're doing for me .
‚Äú A good 90 % of my goals are coming from inside the six-yard box . You need to understand the team 's doing a lot for me , and I love playing in front of the quality we 've got . Long may it continue .
‚Äú It 's fantastic for me to be on 19 goals at this stage .
‚Äú At times , I perhaps get a bit frustrated because I maybe do n't get to touch the ball as much as I want , but when I do get to touch the ball , it 's obviously in good positions , and I 'm scoring so I ca n't argue really . ‚Äù
Asked what his hopes for 2017 were , Gayle added : ‚Äú Promotions ‚Äì as simple as that . ‚Äù
Newcastle lead second-placed Brighton and Hove Albion by one point , though Chris Hughton 's side have a game in hand following the postponement of Friday night 's fixture against Cardiff City .
‚Äú Of course , it 's nice to be top of the table , but obviously we 've played more games than Brighton and we know they 're going to be there all of the way with us , ‚Äù said Gayle .
‚Äú The main thing for us is just to continue what we 're doing .
‚Äú If we can play the same way we have been , and pick up the same number of points as we have done for the first half of the season , we know we 'll be there or thereabouts .
‚Äú So we need to continue to keep doing what we 're doing , keep pushing on and get more points on the board . ‚Äù
Blackburn won 1-0 at St James 's Park in November .
‚Äú We go into it with confidence , ‚Äù said Gayle . ‚Äú But we need to go there knowing if we do n't turn up , we could lose .
‚Äú We 've seen that when they came up to our place that they can be a very dangerous team . They set up strong and were hard to break down .
‚Äú We need to go in there with our heads switched on , and with intensity . ‚Äù
Formidable Germany have their task cut out when they take on Costa Rica in their campaign-opener of the FIFA U-17 World Cup here on Saturday . Germany have made 10 appearances in the tournament but have not won the title so far and are now looking to win this time . They landed early here to adjust themselves to the conditions and have been practicing yoga during their training sessions for the last four days.Head coach Christian Wuck said he will take one match at a time and his side would first look to qualify for the knock-out stage . `` Our first aim is to win against Costa Rica , Iran and Guinea and top the group in order to qualify for the knock out round , '' stated Wuck . `` Players like Jann-Fiete Arp , Elias Abouchabaka and Dennis Jastrzembski who will be in action are billed as the ones who will take up the mantle from illustrious names like Thomas Muller and Toni Kroos , '' added the former Bundesliga player , said . `` These youngsters are not burdened with the pressure of winning a World Cup . Instead , to play in India is seen as an opportunity to learn and develop not just their footballing skills but their personalities and even education , '' German team 's media manager Ronny Zimmerman explained.Costa Rica , who were the last team to arrive in Goa on October 3 , had a training session at two different grounds during the last two days . They will be making their 10th appearance in thistournament with the most successful period coming between 2001 and 2007 , when they reached the knock-out stage on every occasion . Costa Rica won all four games as hosts of the Central American qualifying event to reach the 2017 CONCACAF U-17 Championship on a hot streak.They coasted through the initial group stage with another 100 per cent record defeating Cuba , Canada and Suriname to reach the classification round despite suffering a heavy 1-6 defeat at the hands of eventual champions Mexico . They finished second courtesy their slender 2-1 win over Panama , and in the process advanced to India 2017 . Camacho Viquez , who took the reins of his country 's U-17 side in 2016 , is looking for a good show in this tournament . `` The boys are ready and give their best to win , '' stated Camacho .
LONDON : Online streaming services such Spotify and Apple Music have become the recording industry 's single biggest revenue source , overtaking physical sales of CDs and digital downloads for the first time , a trade group said on Tuesday .
The rapid growth in streaming music services in recent years has led to a recovery in the fortunes of the global recorded music industry , which enjoyed its third year of positive revenue growth , according to a report by industry body IFPI .
Figures released in IFPI 's Global Music Report 2018 show total recording music revenues for 2017 rose to US $ 17.3 billion , up 8.1 percent from the previous year .
Improving finances have led to a tentative re-evaluation of the music industry by stock market investors , who had shied away from the struggling media category for much of the past decade due to a wave of piracy by users and major technology shifts .
Just in the past month , streaming music subscription leader Spotify of Sweden held a record-setting public stock offering . France 's Vivendi , the owner of Universal Music Group , the world 's biggest music label , said on Tuesday it was mulling an IPO .
Tencent Music Entertainment ( TME ) , which attracts three-quarters of China 's booming music streaming market , has been reported by The Wall Street Journal to be eyeing a listing later in 2018 . TME is controlled by internet giant Tencent .

Industry leaders say the growing adoption of paid music streaming services is enabling the market to reach new regions of the world while helping weaning a generation of music fans away from free or pirated music .
`` We estimate that only half the world 's population lives in a thriving music environment and we want to bring the streaming revolution to all of it , '' Stu Bergen , from Warner Music Group , told reporters in London .
During the 15 years ending in 2014 , music sales plunged by 40 percent to US $ 14.3 billion after music file-sharing services such as Napster ravaged sales of CDs while the rise of download services like Apple iTunes failed to offset those declines .
IFPI - The International Federation of the Phonographic Industry - charts the recent recovery to the rise of streaming music . It said there were 176 million users of paid streaming subscription services in 2017 .

Streaming subscriptions in 2017 accounted for 38 percent of recorded music revenue , up from 29 percent in 2016 . The streaming business expanded 41 percent , offsetting a 5 percent decline in physical sales and a 20 percent drop in download revenue .
Despite these improving finances , revenues for 2017 are still only 68.4 percent of the market 's peak in 1999 , IFPI said .
Latin America and China saw the biggest market growth , with a rise in overall music revenue of 17.7 percent and 35.3 percent respectively . The United States , Japan , Germany , Britain and France are the world 's top five music markets by revenue . Brazil ranked No.9 and China was No.10 in 2017 , IFPI said .
IFPI renewed calls for governments to tackle the `` value gap '' between the value created by some digital platforms such as Google 's YouTube for their use of music and what they pay those creating and investing in it . Rival Facebook has been gearing to launch its own music video sharing service .
`` Things are looking good but there 's a structural fault in the system . Until we fix it , it will always be a struggle , ‚Äù said IFPI Chief Executive Frances Moore .
Ed Sheeran ranked as the top global recording artist overtaking Drake , who slipped to No . 2 and Taylor Swift who ranked third , according to the IFPI .

A surgeon has been stood down from his post at a New Delhi hospital for performing an unnecessary operation on a patient 's leg after confusing him with another man , an official said Tuesday .
The surgeon last week drilled a hole in the right leg of 50-year-old Vijendra Tyagi to insert a pin before realising he had operated on the wrong patient .
Tyagi had been admitted to the state-run Sushruta Trauma Centre in the Indian capital with head injuries after a car accident .
But he was mistaken for another man who had a broken leg , and underwent surgery to repair a fracture he had not sustained .
Hospital medical superintendent Ajay Bahl told AFP the patient was under anaesthesia and could not correct the mistake .
The doctor , whose name has not been disclosed , was removed from his post at the centre for negligence and placed in a separate facility under the close supervision of a senior doctor .
`` The surgeon realised the mistake and removed the pin in corrective surgery . He also apologised for the error but we took strong exception and acted against him , '' Bahl said .
Tyagi was discharged from hospital at the weekend but would need a week to completely recover from the unnecessary leg surgery , doctors said .
Reports of medical negligence , often resulting in fatalities , are widespread in India .
Last week two doctors were arrested for negligence after being accused of failing to diagnose a 51-year-old physiotherapist admitted with high blood pressure . She went into cardiac arrest and died .
A week before that incident , a 30-year-old woman was incorrectly put on dialysis at India 's top-ranked All Indian Institute of Medical Sciences after complaining of minor abdominal pain . The doctor tried to tamper with documents to cover up the blunder .
In December a Delhi hospital incorrectly declared a pair of premature twins dead despite one being alive , causing outrage and forcing the government to shut the institution . The infant died at another hospital a few days later .
Jammu : The Jammu and Kashmir government on Tuesday approved implementation of the seventh pay commission recommendations for its employees and pensioners with effect from January 2016 .
There will be over 20 percent hike in salaries of employees due to revised pay scales that are coming into effect from April .
The decision was taken by the state cabinet meeting in Jammu on Tuesday under Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti . The cabinet approved implementation of the 7th pay commission recommendations for state government employees and pensioners , Finance Minister Syed Altaf Ahmed Bukhari told reporters in Jammu on Tuesday .
The decision would benefit around five lakh employees and pensioners in the state , he said .
The financial implications of implementation of the 7th pay commission recommendations would be Rs 4,201 crore annually while one-time arrears would cost Rs 7,477 crore top the exchequer , Bukhari said .
The state government employees can now draw the salary for the month of April 2018 as per the revised scales , he said .
For the purpose of implementation of the 7th Pay Commission Recommendations , basic pay as on 31 December , 2015 , of employees shall be multiplied by uniform factor of 2.57 and then adjusted in the matrix recommended by the Pay Committee .
The benefit of House Rent Allowance on revised pay shall be available from April , 2018 and all allowances except Dearness Allowance ( DA ) shall continue as before while DA from January , 2016 onwards shall be paid on revised pay on new rates to be notified by Finance Department , he added .
According to the decision , gratuity shall be enhanced from the existing ceiling of Rs 10 lakh to Rs 20 lakh with effect from January 1 , 2016 , with increase in the ceiling on gratuity by 25 percent whenever DA rises by 50 percent as recommended by 7th CPC/ as per Central Government pattern .
The pensioners shall be given option to choose revision of pension by any of the two formulations suggested by the Pay Committee .
Arrears of pensioners shall be paid in cash in three six monthly instalments while arrears of all employees shall be drawn and credited to their GP Fund accounts with moratorium of 3 years for withdrawal of same , minister said .
However , there will be no moratorium for withdrawal in case of employees retiring up to 31 March , 2021 . The implementation of 7th pay commission recommendations for PSUs and autonomous organisations will depend on the availability of resources with the respective organisations , he added .
Regarding pay anomalies , the cabinet decided that the existing Pay Committee shall look into and address the issue of anomalies starting with the issue of anomalies of the Clerical Cadre , he added . The cabinet also approved a slew of administrative reforms to streamline the functioning at various levels in the government .

20-years later , fans still really hate the Star Wars special editions that George Lucas forced upon us in 1997 . The biggest crime is that he altered the original film prints , so the original cuts of the movies have yet to be officially released in any sort of modern format . Though , many dedicated fans have done their best to amend this . Super fan Adywan is one of the most shining examples and he has just finished work on the long-awaited The Empire Strikes Back : Revisited , a painstaking fan edit that is intended to present fans with `` what the special editions should have been . '' And you can see it for yourself , if you 're willing to jump through some hoops .
According to a recent post on the official Facebook page for Star Wars : Revisited , this new version of Star Wars : Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back is now available . The creators provided some links to download the newly edited version of the movie , which incorporated newly created models and `` upgraded '' shots in order to create something much more in line with the original theatrical release , but with some less offensive improvements . A complete list of changes , and there are more than 200 of them , can be viewed on Star Wars Revisited Blog . So far , the fan response has been overwhelmingly positive . Here 's what the creative team had to say about the release .
`` The day has finally come where I can share this edit with all of you . It 's been a long hard slog , with many ups and downs ( mainly downs ) , but I was never prepared to just give up . The support you have all shown is what kept me going , so I ca n't thank you enough . Now , how do you get it ? We do not support piracy . Please do n't ask us for copies of the DVD or offer us any money or anything else in return for a copy . We will refuse every time . We did not set out to do this project for anything other than enjoyment and wanting to share an alternate version of the films . We have purchased the official versions of the films , so we would like you to do so too . ''
As much as fans may want to see The Empire Strikes Back : Revisited , which follows the `` Revisited '' version of the original 1977-Star Wars , it is certainly operating in some sketchy areas , legally speaking . Disney currently owns the rights to Star Wars and releasing any version of these movies is certainly not legal , but Adywan and his team are doing their best to make it clear they are n't doing this for profit and are n't trying to step on any toes . That is why they are n't directly providing copies to anyone and why they are n't accepting any money .
Illegal or not , this is something that Star Wars fans arguably deserve . Even though these versions are intended to `` exist within its own canon , '' they are filling a void . As it stands , the only way to watch the original , theatrical versions of the original Star Wars trilogy is a very poor DVD version that was transferred from a LaserDisc copy . Beyond that , it 's VHS or an actual LaserDisc copy , which is far from ideal , given that we live in the age of Blu-ray and digital HD . And , as it stands , Disney and Lucasfilm have no plans on releasing the unaltered versions of the original Star Wars trilogy .
This is just one of many examples that prove the Star Wars fanbase is like no other in the history of pop culture . If you want to get your hands on a copy of The Empire Strikes Back : Revisited , the links probably wo n't stay online forever before they start getting taken down . You can check out the full Facebook post from the Star Wars : Revisited gang below , which includes any information you 'll need to see this version of the movie for yourself .
SEOUL : South Korea will need their talisman Son Heung-min to bring his sparkling English Premier League form to the World Cup if they are to survive a devilishly tricky group .
The Koreans crashed out in the first round of the 2014 tournament in Brazil and have their work cut out to avoid the same fate in Russia , where they have been drawn alongside holders Germany , Sweden and Mexico .

But they boast genuine star quality in snake-hipped Tottenham attacker Son , who lit up the Premier League this season , helping Spurs finish third and secure a UEFA Champions League place .
One of the best players to emerge from Asia , the 25-year-old scored 18 goals in all competitions in a brilliant campaign with the London club and once again carries the hopes of a nation heading into the World Cup .
South Korea made history with their astonishing run to the 2002 World Cup semi-finals but the current crop of players have struggled to hit those heights - or come anywhere close .
Son almost single-handedly led the Taeguk Warriors to the Asian Cup final in 2015 , where they lost to host Australia , but his eye-catching performances earned him a move from German club Bayer Leverkusen to Spurs , where the mercurial forward has been a big hit with supporters .

Son will be desperate to deliver for his legions of fans in South Korea and has the weapons to pose a serious threat to Sweden in their World Cup opener on Jun 18 .
The Koreans realistically also need to take points from Mexico with world champions Germany awaiting them in their final Group F fixture in Kazan .
Pelted with toffees by fans in a traditional Korean insult on their return from Brazil four years ago , they will need star man Son to be on song in Russia to avoid a repeat .
Map of the restricted area around the Allie Lake wildfire provided by the BC Wildfire Service .
The Allie Lake wildfire is now 100 per cent contained .
‚Äú It sure is , ‚Äù confirmed BC Wildfire Service information officer Jody Lucius . ‚Äú We 've upgraded the status of the fire from out of control to being held . ‚Äù
Lucious said the service no longer expects the fire will grow any further due to the current weather and resources deployed to the fire .
More than seven millimetres of rain fell on the fire overnight , which the BC Wildfire Service noted as aiding suppression efforts .
‚Äú For public safety and to enable our crews to continue to work on suppression we do ask the public to remain out of that area , ‚Äù said Lucious .
Fire crews are still working on fortifying guards already in place , moping up the fire 's edges and extinguishing hot spots within the fire 's perimeter . Assessments on trees in danger of falling will also be done in key areas of the fires in the coming days , as well as a scan of the fire to help identify more hot spots .
The area restriction order is still in place and recreation sites remain closed .

People think devil worshipping involves going into a dark building at 2am , chanting satan praises naked and drinking human blood . No . This thing comes in many forms , and I see it in Kenya daily .
The fire engine operator who drives his machine to a raging fire WITHOUT WATER‚Ä¶that is a devil worshiper .
The Indian who pays you Kshs 15,000 per month before tax in Industrial Area , yet your title is Senior Accountant , and you work 70 hours a week , is a devil worshipper .
A Commander in Chief who goes watching Formula One in Abu Dhabi , while his troops have just been slaughtered in a foreign country , is a very senior devil worshipper .
A man who fills the table with beer and shares pictures on social media , while his mother is being threatened by the Omena Traders Association of Siaya ( OTAS ) , over unpaid omena debts , is actually devil worshipping .
A woman who writes a message , ‚Äú Ni wewe tu baby , ca n't wait until you chew me like Big G again ‚Äù , then sends it to 12 different men at midnight , is not just a devil worshipper , but the devil 's first cousin .
And all those people who ca n't see the sacrifices Raila Odinga has made for our liberation‚Ä¶.saitan .
Do n't assume the devil is only worshipped in a building along Nyerere Road
In a tense standoff between nuclear-armed nations that threatens to destabilize Asia , both sides are digging in , with one warning of unspecified ‚Äú countermeasures ‚Äù and the other saying it wo n't be bullied .
In this case , it 's not the United States and North Korea ‚Äî whose leaders exchanged bombastic warnings last week ‚Äî but India and China , which are locked in an impasse over a remote Himalayan plateau .
An editorial last week in China 's state-run Global Times tabloid warned that Beijing would use ‚Äú all possible means ‚Äù to get India to withdraw scores of troops from Dolam , a 34-square-mile bowl along the border that the two Asian giants share with the tiny mountain kingdom of Bhutan .
India has refused , arguing that the land claimed by China actually belongs to Bhutan , with which India shares a close relationship .
The face-off between Indian soldiers and Chinese border guards ‚Äî positioned just a few hundred feet apart atop the 10,000-foot plateau ‚Äî marks one of the most serious military confrontations since 1962 , when the two countries fought a one-month war won by China that left more than 2,000 troops dead , most of them Indian .
That conflict also began with a border dispute in the Himalayas ‚Äî and there is more at stake this time around .

A growing rivalry between giants
China and India not only are the two most populous countries in the world , each with more than 1.3 billion people . They also are increasingly confident players in a battle for supremacy in southern Asia .
Under President Xi Jinping , Beijing has constructed islands to extend its influence over the South China Sea , initiated the mammoth Belt and Road infrastructure-building project westward through Pakistan and cultivated closer ties with countries ‚Äî including Bangladesh , Sri Lanka , Nepal and Bhutan ‚Äî that long have been in India 's orbit .
But Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has displayed more willingness to confront China than his predecessors .
At his 2014 swearing-in , Modi irked Beijing by inviting the leader of the India-based government-in-exile of Tibet , which China views as part of its territory . New Delhi has opposed Xi 's signature Belt and Road Initiative , arguing that it encroaches on Indian lands and expressing skepticism over Chinese intentions .
India also has quietly built up its military capabilities by posting additional infantry troops , army reservists and tanks in the plains of Ladakh , site of two previous border standoffs with China in 2013 and 2014 .
China is unquestionably stronger militarily , owning the world 's largest standing army of more than 2 million troops , twice as many as India . Beijing also possesses five times as many tanks and submarines and double the number of warships and military aircraft .
Fresh standoff in the mountains
The current crisis began in early June , when Chinese construction teams ‚Äî escorted by People 's Liberation Army border guards ‚Äî arrived with bulldozers to extend a road running south through a Tibetan valley into Dolam .
The plateau is one of several disputed points along the Chinese-Bhutan border . The two sides have conducted 24 rounds of negotiations over the border , but Dolam 's status remains unresolved .
India has no claim on Dolam , but it backs Bhutan 's interpretation of an 1890 border agreement that the land belongs to Bhutan . On June 16 , Indian troops stationed nearby came into Dolam and physically blocked the Chinese teams from working .
Two months later , India and China remain at an impasse , with hundreds of soldiers positioned in the disputed area while their governments trade barbs in the media .

A stronger China mocks its neighbor
Chinese state media 's tone has alternated between condescension ‚Äî belittling India for its ostensibly weaker military ‚Äî and rancor .
India ‚Äú lacks strength compared with China , ‚Äù the state-run Global Times tabloid said in an editorial last week , adding that the outcome of the standoff ‚Äú is fixed . ‚Äù
‚Äú If the Narendra Modi government continues ignoring the warning coming from a situation spiraling out of control , countermeasures from China will be unavoidable , ‚Äù it said .
China 's Foreign Ministry this month issued a document that traced the country 's claim over the disputed area to a 1980 convention with Britain and accused India of violating international law by invading Chinese territory .
The standoff has triggered an outpouring of nationalism and patriotism on Chinese social media . Many Web users accused India of bluster and questioned why Chinese authorities had n't responded more forcefully .
One commenter on Weibo , the Chinese version of Twitter , wrote : ‚Äú Our central government and military commanders , why do n't you put down India right now ? ‚Äù

View from India : Standing up to ‚Äò a bully '
The reaction in India has been more muted , perhaps owing to its status as the feebler power . Commentators have focused on India 's commitment to Bhutan and what New Delhi views as Chinese belligerence .
Kanwal Sibal , a former Indian foreign secretary , wrote on the Daily O website that China ‚Äú is baring the ugly face of its diplomacy more and more , using unbecoming language , adopting condescending postures , crowing about the disparity in power between it and others and unashamedly acting as a bully where it thinks it can . ‚Äù
Defense Minister Arun Jaitley on Wednesday made a veiled reference to the face-off when he told lawmakers that ‚Äú some people are targeting our country 's sovereignty and integrity , but I am fully confident that our brave soldiers have the capability to keep our country secure . ‚Äù
Bhutan has maintained a studied silence except for one statement issued by its Foreign Ministry in late June , saying China was in ‚Äú direct violation ‚Äù of its agreements with the kingdom and calling for a return to the pre-June 16 status quo .
Seeds of future confrontations ?
Neither India nor China has anything to gain from a military confrontation . But with Modi readying for a likely reelection bid in 2019 and Xi preparing for the once-every-five-years Communist Party congress this fall , experts say both leaders are unwilling to be seen as backing down .

He 's ready .
He finally got his victory lap , and now Doug Ford is showcasing his party as unified and ready to do battle to be the next government of Ontario .
The newly minted leader of the Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario spoke to his party 's faithful in the heart of Ford country ‚Äì Etobicoke ‚Äì on Monday night .
Surrounded by his three leadership rivals Christine Elliott , Tanya Granic Allan and Caroline Mulroney , Ford spoke to the Tory base about the importance of moving forward and focusing their sights on the real opponent ‚Äî Premier Kathleen Wynne and her politically corrupt Liberal government .
To an enthusiastic and diverse crowd of nearly 2,000 people , Ford was n't shy about taking direct aim at Wynne , who earlier in the day watched the Lieutenant Governor of Ontario deliver her government 's Speech from the Throne ‚Äî read further mortgaging your and your children 's financial future .
‚Äú Today she ( Wynne ) wrote a lot of cheques but having looked at the finances , I have to warn you folks , Kathleen 's cheques are going to bounce , ‚Äù Ford said .
And he 's not wrong .
The Liberals are handing Ontarians a massive $ 8-billion deficit in next week 's budget , with no sign of slowing down spending any time soon .
Their fiscal insanity needs to come to an end , and Ford could very well be the only person who can do that .
With Andrea Horwath and her NDP promising even more free goodies at taxpayers ' expense , it 's not a particularly difficult choice for Ontarians who are desperately looking for change .
And for those who remain squeamish about a Premier Doug Ford ‚Äî even some in his own party ‚Äî ask yourself , how much worse could it be than what we have with the Liberals ?
Ford spoke candidly about courting voters from the other parties , said this election is n't about him ‚Äî it 's about the people of Ontario and their future .
That 's a message that resonates , regardless of party lines .
Though thin on specific policies he would implement , that was n't the point of Monday night 's rally . It was , in part , meant to dispel the ‚Äú Ford lone wolf ‚Äù strategy he 's far too often wrongly accused of .
It was intended to show Ontarians he can work with a strong competent team , as was demonstrated by having Granic Allen , Mulroney and Elliott standing with him .
And the Liberals know this . They are already dispatching their messaging about a potential Ford government ‚Äì one that is reckless and cold-hearted .
But it wo n't work this time . Wynne 's tired government is out of ideas and has been around too long .
Change is coming to Ontario and it will most likely be in the form of Doug Ford 's united PC Party .
All 26 Labour MPs in the North East have signed a joint letter calling on the Government to increase transport funding in the region .
Their plea follows similar requests for extra funding to improve the A19 in our area as part of this paper 's Safe A19 campaign .
Our campaign logo .
Among the signatories are Sunderland MPs Julie Elliott , Sharon Hodgson and Bridget Phillipson , South Tyneside MPs Stephen Hepburn and Emma Lewell-Buck , Easington MP Grahame Morris and Hartlepool MP Mike Hill .
Along with their party colleagues , they are highlighting what they see as the inequality between what is spent on transport in the North and London `` with London receiving more than double the amount the North receives per head of the population '' .
The letter , addressed to the Secretary of State for Transport , Chris Grayling , demands to know what his department intends to do to address `` the lack of investment in the North East 's transport systems '' .
It also asks for urgent steps to be taken to increase funding levels to address `` ongoing chronic and historic underfunding in transport infrastructure across the North East of England . ''
Ian Mearns , MP for Gateshead , said : ‚Äú the recent Institute for Public Policy Research report , Future Transport Investment in the North , with figures taken from official government statistics , graphically highlights the huge disparity in spending plans on transport infrastructure between the North East of England and London .
‚Äú It is widely recognised that there is no doubt that our transport infrastructure in the North East is , at best , poor and in many cases dreadful .
`` Therefore , this is an urgent and unified appeal for government action to rectify a long-term problem . ‚Äù

Following the fall of the Mehbooba Mufti government in Jammu and Kashmir last month , the Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP ) has been quietly examining various options to form the government in the state , although nothing concrete has come out so far .
However , political analysts fear that any attempts by the BJP to form the government , with a breakaway faction of the Peoples Democratic Party ( PDP ) , will trigger more resentment and unrest in the Valley , which is already reeling under intense volatility .
A split in the PDP to form a third front , which could either align with the National Conference-Congress coalition or the BJP , would be seen as another intervention by New Delhi to rule the state by engineering ‚Äò defections ' . The alliance , particularly with the BJP , would be seen by the people as another attempt that a ruling party at the Centre was turning to ‚Äò horse trading ' to form the government . The resentment will get intensified as all political parties including NC , PDP and Congress fought elections on the plank that they will keep BJP out of power .
Former chief ministers , Mufti Mohammad Sayeed and Mehbooba Mufti , had come under scathing attack for forming a coalition with the BJP . Before Mehbooba supported BJP , she had admitted that it was an `` unpopular '' alliance . After the BJP withdrew support to Mehbooba on 19 June forcing the imposition of Governor 's Rule in the state , hectic lobbying is on to form a government in the state .
Political commentator , Noor Ahmad Baba , said , ‚Äú The electoral manoeuvring by BJP will trigger resentment among people . The people were not happy with the previous alliance of PDP and BJP and they wo n't be happy with any defections and electoral fraud . ‚Äù
Previously , it was the Congress which was seen as the one to be engineering defections in Kashmir . It even dismissed the elected governments to rule the troubled state . The NC contested the 1951 elections in the state and won all the Assembly seats uncontested , except for the two seats on which Opposition parties put up candidates . However , it was only two years later , in 1953 , that former prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru got NC founder and then prime minister of Jammu and Kashmir , Sheikh Abdullah detained on charges of espionage and he was dismissed from the government . The charges against him were dropped in 1964 .
Noted historian , Farooq Fayaz said , `` As far as relations between NC and Congress were concerned there were dissimilarities in their agendas . The Naya Kashmir agenda was the political draft for an independent and autonomous country by the NC . At the Centre , Indian National Congress was fighting for emancipation from British rule and in the same way people of Kashmir were fighting for their rights against the autocratic Dogras . But the post-partition landscape in India and the emergence of right-wing ideology forced the ouster of Sheikh Abdullah . ‚Äù
After the subsequent jail terms for Sheikh ended , he started the Plebiscite Front , which sought a referendum in Kashmir ‚Äî a similar stance which is now espoused by separatists ‚Äî and the Congress managed to merge the NC with it to stay in power in Jammu and Kashmir . It was under the leadership of GM Sadiq that NC merged into Congress and the party ruled the state from 1965 to 1975 .
However , in 1975 , after former prime minister Indira Gandhi signed an accord with Sheikh Abdullah ‚Äî which was known as the Indira-Sheikh accord ‚Äî Syed Mir Qasim , the Congress chief minister since 1972 , resigned from his position to make way for Sheikh Abdullah . However , the Congress party withdrew the support that it had offered to Sheikh Abullah only two years later in 1977 .
Fayaz said that Sheikh Abdullah was brought back to power only to disband the Plebiscite Front .
`` Sheikh revived the NC after the Plebiscite Front was disbanded . But he was a chief minister of the Congress MLAs . None represented NC in the Assembly and Sheikh Abdullah was himself not an MLA . Subsequently , NC was used as a tool and the support was withdrawn to Sheikh Abdullah which necessitated elections in the state , '' the political analyst said .
In the subsequent mid-term elections , NC won 47 seats in the Assembly under Sheikh Abdullah . However , after his death in 1982 , Sheikh Abdullah 's son , Farooq Abdullah , became the chief minister of the state . But he also could last only two years in power as the Congress party engineered defections in the NC and Farooq 's brother-in-law , GM Shah joined hands with it to form the government . That had lead to the dismissal of Farooq from office .
`` The defections in the NC was also part of a ploy to use the regional party as a mere tool . A democratically elected government was removed and it was an attempt to erode the special constitutional position of the state , ‚Äù said Fayaz . He added that withdrawal of support by BJP to PDP is to `` use regional political parties as only as an apparatus to enforce the Unionist agenda on the ground '' .
However after Shah assumed office , only two years later he was also dismissed and Farooq returned as the chief minister in 1987 in the wake of another accord with former prime minister Rajiv Gandhi , which was known as Rajiv-Farooq accord . Subsequently , the two parties fought the elections together in 1987 and the government lasted for three years before the militancy erupted in Kashmir . During the 1987 elections after the Congress-NC accord in Jammu and Kashmir , the Muslim United Front ( MUF ) fielded many candidates against the alliance . Due to electoral malpractices , the MUF supporters crossed the border , which was also one of the contributing factors for the rising militancy in Jammu and Kashmir . However , after 1990 the state was placed under Governor 's Rule which extended until the 1996 elections when the NC won 57 Assembly seats . However , it was widely believed that the polls were held under coercion of the government forces .
The state has been again placed under Governor 's Rule and NN Vohra has kept the Assembly under suspended animation even as political parties have sought the dissolution of Assembly .
